2953656,4,B00004D2X8,This is a great movie. Don't pay attention to most all of the one star reviews.  Most of them are not for this movie but for the 3rd mummy movie. This is doing a great disservice to the 1999 The Mummy.,1524009600,,201,3.902439024390244
2953657,5,B00004D2X8,I love the mummy movies so much I collected them all but this particular one went missing. I was so happy to have been able to replace it.,1522281600,,138,3.9642857142857144

2953659,3,B00004D2X8,"This review is for the now rampant and obnoxious phenomenon of online cropping of a widescreen movie to fit your stupid iPads and phones.
Despite TVs getting bigger and bigger, another moron executive declares ""Most people watch on their tiny 3"" screen of their phones"" so you can't have a slightly wider image, you have to maximize the screen space.

And that is why movies shot in 2.39:1 are cropped for 16x9 and zoomed in, so you lose information on the sides and the image is less sharp.

I lose track of how many are cropped like this because I shut the movie off everything this happens.

I thought the days of Pan and Scan were over. Apparently not, stupid people will demand stupidity and here were are, watching the Mummy and other movies how no one involved with the movie intended.",1521936000,,792,4.563380281690141

2953682,5,B00004D2X8,"Great movie, has all you need, action, adventure, romance and some scary bits without all the profanity and things todays movies have. Reminds me of a Princess Bride type movie, they don't make good adventure movies like this anymore. Its 18 years old and still looks good, special effects don't look outdated.

2953690,4,B00004D2X8,This movie doesn't get enough credit. Aside from the odd re-casting of Evelyn it comepletely embodies the same by the numbers silly action and spirit of the first two films. It's enjoyable and a million times better then the Cruise remake which was absolute trash. In a perfect universe Universal should bring Brendan Frasier back and continue this franchise.,1512086400,,359,5.101694915254237

2953705,3,B00004D2X8,"First, some of us who watched parts 1 & II are inevitably going to compare, and like most other movies, I feel that parts 1 and 2 were better (maybe I got bored of the story and they changed the actress for Eve, but I must commend her for her awesome British accent since she is American).
Next, as an Asian living in the US, I know very well that most (if not all) American Chinese do not know how to speak/read Mandarin Chinese, so why force them to do that in movies - I did not understand a single word General Ming uttered, meanwhile Michelle Yeoh being a veteran actress could barely pulled off her pseudo Chinese lines, not to mention her daughter Lin. I think they should look for true bilingual actors/actresses or write the plot in a way that the Chinese know how to speak English.",1507766400,,791,4.315436241610739

2953709,2,B00004D2X8,"Dear film people,
If you are going to change the female lead... change her name. Fans of this franchise have enjoyed the chemistry between Rick and Evelyn.  When you put another actress in those shoes, you made that relationship cold and unfeeling.

Now, on to the review.

Rick was a jerk.
Alex lost his English accent;
Evelyn lost that loving feeling.

Do not get me wrong... I like Maria Bello.  She was just not the right fit for this franchise.

2953720,3,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy became my ""go-to"" movie after the first time I saw it. I loved the campy horror-comedy aspect of it and the script was face paced and well written. I don't have a tv subscription, so I turn on a movie when I'm doing housework or to play in the background while I'm cooking or knitting, or whatever. I've turned on the first two movies so many times I've lost count. I watched this movie one time and one time only.
In the second movie, we're introduced to Alex, who is an adorable ten year old with the cutest British accent and the expected mischievous streak. In this movie, he's a grown man with an American accent and a lot of resentment towards his parents. Rick and Evie have an argument over who caused the rift; ""You were cold and ignored him"" ""you smothered him"", etc. Totally unnecessary plot line in my opinion.
John Hannah was perfect as Jonathan and had the funniest lines in the first two movies, but he's more of an after thought this time around. He wasn't the only underused actor, and with this much star power the script should have been so much better.
I give it three stars because I thought the acting was good even though the script sucked (seriously - Yeti??) and I couldn't agree with the two star ""I didn't like it"" rating.
 I found it to be an average movie with above-average potential and expected so much more from this franchise. Watch the first two, but skip this one.",1504483200,,1410,4.423076923076923

The script, the characters, the gorgeous vision of Egypt all of it awesome!

The new Mummy (Tom Cruise) can't be compared with this one all though they have a bit of similarity. This one was inspired by the old mummy movie but The Tom Cruise movie was a reboot from the old monster gang ( the mummy, Dracula, swamp thing, etc) so they are both really good shows.",1501977600,,560,4.072727272727272

One of those movies that SHOULD be bad, should be corny, you think it's going to be hard to watch, but no, it's comedic timing is perfect, it's just ridiculous enough to be completely enjoyable but not so ridiculous you lose enjoyment. This movie is in a category by itself and honestly is not a horror movie, it is not a ""scary"" movie, and the fact that the tom cruise reboot tried to make it into that is laughable and gross.

This movie -- I mean, I think we all know what to expect at this point, and no one has any illusions that these are going to be cinematic works of art. It's really kind of a bad movie, but it's a fun movie. Given the correct writers, it could have been a pretty great movie. As it is, though, it was a fun diversion.",1497744000,,473,3.826530612244898
2953754,3,B00004D2X8,Love the mummy movies.  This one is packed with action almost too much non stop explosions and chases.  Maria Bellow does a nice job but I missed Rachel Weiss playing Evelyn.

4. Brenden Fraser can carry a lead role like Ryan Reynolds

The film manages the difficult task of evoking INDIANA JONES style action without coming across as campy. Too many films in the pulp adventure genre don't take their subject matter seriously and are directed with tongue firmly in cheek. Sommers doesn't do that here and Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Oded Fehr all give solid performances as the heroes of the film. Arnold Vosloo's Mummy has a believable background that almost, but not quite, has you rooting for him to re-unite with his long lost beloved.",1495065600,,674,5.026785714285714

There isn't one single character that doesn't tie into the purpose of our main characters' goals - which is to first uncover the history and treasure then stop the mummy from ending the world - without having a reason to be there in the first place. Even the drunken Captain *Spoiler Alert* had a purpose to the storyline that ran along perfectly with his own desires/goals to go down in a cloud of glory like his fellow comrades before him. Every character has a purpose, and a bit of enough background to have a reason to be there. It's funny while still keeping the intensity and thrills of the story.

In my book, this is a movie that was perfectly thought out from the script and casting to the special effects (especially for 1999).",1494374400,,855,4.445859872611465

2953791,5,B00004D2X8,"I've always thought there needs to be a new type of awards show, one that specializes not in movies that deal with personal wars or the human condition, but are just good, fun movies. Instead of being the Oscars. They would be ""The Mummies."" Whenever I watch another movie that's just trying to be an enjoyable romp for a couple of hours, I'll rate it ""X Mummies out of 10"".

Point is, I see The Mummy as the perfect popcorn flick. It knew exactly what it wanted to be, and it was that to the fullest. And it plays with its own tropes. The characters are practically aware of the cheesy sort of situation their in, and they own their roles. Brendan Fraser, who has just had the most rotten luck in the past decade or so, is at his best here. He plays a character who is simultaneously super-skilled and very vulnerable in a fight, intelligent but able to make the occasional dumb joke. In short, he's the perfect lighthearted action hero.

The story itself is very tightly told, and there's relatively little wasted space. The CGI is clearly dated at this point, but it doesn't stand out quite like the Rock's face does in the sequel. But overall, the best part is that The Mummy is willing to have fun with itself. It's a classic tale of derring-do that we just don't see enough of these days. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. And if you have seen it, see it again. It's just a great way to spend a couple hours and come away smiling.",1483574400,,1446,4.332103321033211

Rachel Weisz's shoes are big to fill and Maria Bello did a nice enough job, but she's no Rachel (although to be fair, who could be, really?). And as many reviewers have mentioned, the characters are just not the same, and you can feel a lack of continuity in who they are, how they act and the chemistry they had together.

But the plot, the new cast from China and the special effects certainly have plenty of redeeming qualities, and it's still worth a watch, even if you loved the first two. Just don't watch this one after the other two!",1480723200,,712,4.227941176470588

2953843,4,B00004D2X8,"Rick O'Connell and his motley crew are back for one more ""Mummy"" film. Though the series was getting on in years, this one actually makes me a bit sad, to tell the truth.

Why does it make me sad? Well, not only is it the end of an awfully fun series, it's a film that I've come to see as a sort of parable about the importance of hard work.

There are a few things about the third ""Mummy"" that really throw people off. First is the acting: the actor who played Alex was probably the worst, and while others have commented plenty on the talents of a few other members of the cast, I would say he's the one who really deserves this nomination for a completely lifeless Hayden Christiansen performance. I'm sorry, but it was bad even for me.

The second part is the dialogue. Some of the dialogue is meh, some of it is downright terrible, but a little of it is as funny and quotable as the first two films, so evidently someone with some brain stopped in on the script once in a while.

Sadly, both these flaws are very noticeable, which results in a terrible review from many people. This is a shame because the rest of the movie is really quite lovely. The action sequences are kinetic and large, and there's a lot of them. The final battle at the end remains one of my favorites in a film due to its sheer scale and concept, neverminding the solid execution. The visual design really helps tell the story, and is some of the more interesting and creative I've seen. Great costumes, very cool terracotta warrior monsters, really gorgeous production design, honestly. All of it really stuck with me. Most of the cast is great as always, from grumbling about mummies to hiking great distances to whacking at bad guys. Michelle Yeoh is thoughtful, tough as nails, and super gorgeous (I think she's immortal in real life, too), and Jet Li gets to look good in armor, ride a horse, and kick people in the chest, all specialties of his. The soundtrack by Randy Edelman is beautiful- it sounds exactly like a film like this should, from the rich Western orchestra to the different moods of traditional Chinese instruments, it's worth it to buy on its own.

All in all, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" was a film dragged down sadly because there were a few people working on it that failed to pull their weight. This is by no means a reflection on the majority of the people working on the film, who definitely went out of their way to give us a fun, explosive, and visually creative film, and by no means did they disappoint.",1473292800,,2526,4.423655913978495
2953844,5,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is best described as a blend of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider with some pretty great visual effects. It's a solid adventure yarn with a great heart and an awesome cast. Brendan Fraser is a lovable rogue with a penchant for dual-wielding. Rachel Weiss is the brain of the hero team, a sensible archaeologist with some skills that turn out to be just the right ones for saving the day. John Hannah is purely comic relief, but he's fantastic at it. Oded Fehr is a Magi, a wizard with mad sword skills who can also use a machine gun, and Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez are the toughest, buffest mummies ever. There's so many great action and comedic scenes, and plenty of quotable dialogue. The art direction and the late Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack take us to just the right place for this sort of romp, and the CGI monsters are really good for 1999. All in all, a really quality action film that rises above the dross from ""good bad"" to just plain good. See and see again.",1473292800,,989,4.5

Competently made action movie that remembers what made the first movie so much fun and faithfully recycles those elements.

2953882,5,B00004D2X8,"This movie puts the original Universal Mummy to shame. It's been turned into a swashbuckling, live action flick with enough one-liners and derring-do to satisfy all.

Not one character in this movie is found wanting, from the mummy himself, who's portrayed as vengeful, determined, and undoubtedly sexy for a change as well as being very much included in the action, to the mercenary and cowardly Beni are well-cast and brilliantly played. Harking back to the original in the use of the title character's name, we find Imhotep the high priest, Anck-es-namun the courtesan, and Pharaoh Seti again playing their rolls ikn a love triangle for the ages.  New characters have been added; this time the desert tribesmen are not protecting the mummy himself, but reather the rest of the world from him by keeping the city where he's buried a secret.

Great special effects, some lovely desert scenery, and a great deal of hairs-breadth escapes make this a rousing adventure tale instead of a ""horror"" movie, which is exactly what it should've been all along.

2953905,1,B00004D2X8,"This could have been a great movie. There are a lot of great elements- great setting, great characters, and the story has a lot of potential. Even the casting (with the notable exception of Maria Bello) is excellent; one of the reasons I was compelled to watch the movie is because of the characters developed by the actors in the first two films. Also Jet Li as a villain! Michelle Yeoh! What could go wrong?

Unfortunately everything.

The whole film is sloppy and rushed. By rushed I mean RUSHED. Despite the fantastic premise the filmmakers utterly fail to even interest the audience let alone thrill. No care is taken with advancing the story... With a throwaway line or two we are sped from place to place. Characters accept absolutely extraordinary events with barely a comment. There is no time to comment, off to the next piece of exposition. Even the relationships are rushed! The characters of Alex and the daughter (whose name I literally did not catch) exchange about 3 lines of dialogue before she's happy to sacrifice IMMORTALITY for him. Rick is dying and Evy, his one true love, can barely work up an anguished grimace before they've crossed the mountains, found Shangri La, and restored him from the very edge of oblivion. There is Zero suspense, Zero mystery and Zero plot. It's like the writers decided since we've seen the first and second movies they didn't have to bother with any cohesive story- they would just throw some action sequences and CGI at us and we'd be thrilled. Look! Yeti! Amazing!

Apparently the filmmakers never learned the difference between story and plot.

This is a somewhat finer point, but it bothered me... There is absolutely no logic the use of the various languages- at one point the character of Zi Yuan raises an army of the dead using an ancient Chinese curse in ENGLISH. Evy, who is supposed to be an expert in Ancient Egypt, can magically read Ancient Chinese, but the 2,000 years dead mummy speaks perfect modern Mandarin. Don't get me started with the Brittish vs American accents. I'm trying to suspend disbelief over here and the inconsistency of it all is maddening.

The dialogue is inane. The characters deliver the corniest and cheesiest of lines with total conviction, except Maria Bello, who could not be more wooden. (She and Brendan Fraser have ZERO chemistry) I started really disliking the characters I had loved in the first two films. No care is taken with new character development. I don't know or care with their personal desires may be. It's all about the surface conflict- raise the mummy, kill the mummy. There is no depth.

If you enjoyed the first two films and care at all about the characters in them then my recommendation is to leave this one in the box.",1459123200,,2739,4.75578947368421

2954017,5,B00004D2X8,"I love to revisit this film. Perhaps, this is the best film created in the adventure genre in the late 90-ies. If you analyze the plot, in its basis it is nothing new. But the makers of this film managed to put on screen, vivid and fascinating story about of the treasure hunters. Each of them had heard about the treasures of the Pharaoh. Each of the members of the expedition had the chance to find these treasures and become immensely rich. But here's the thing! Initially, these treasures are cursed by the Pharaoh and his mummy ready to stand on guard to protect his tomb. It seems that this warning enough not to indulge in such speculations. But isn't the risk of death stops the heroes of this film? No. They embrace the idea in whatever was to find and seize the treasure of the Pharaoh. Even at the cost of his own life.

Maria Bello maintains an annoying horribly acted character who lacks any chemistry with Brendan Fraser.

It is somewhat entertaining and it has its originality from the change of region (China instead of Ancient Egypt, calling to prolongate the saga with mummies all around the globe) but it stays very unremarkable due to a non exciting directing and no interest in the new characters that are brought. The story of the son of Jonathan and his girlfriend is really basic, Maria Bello does not manage to be a good replacer of Rachel Weisz and the Mummy of Jet Li is too much of a moster instead of a real character.",1425081600,,613,4.433628318584071

2954094,5,B00004D2X8,"I will keep this brief as this is the blu-ray release of a 1998 movie.  If you have not yet seen The Mummy, you are in for a treat.  Brendan Frasier plays the part of Rick O'Connell and he helps the beautiful and intriguing Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, and her brother to find the Lost City of Hamunaptra.  Along the way they encounter the deadly and mysterious Medjai, and the sniveling, insidious Benny, Rick's former friend.  Together, Rick and Evelyn must overcome the deadly traps of the Mummy's tomb to find treasures untold, or grisly death...

The Blu-Ray transfer of this movie is fine.  Perhaps my DVD copy was just that good, but I didn't notice a difference between the two formats.  This is by no means a bad thing.  The picture is crisp and clear and the audio is as good as ever.  This movie has a great blend of action, comedy, and tension and is satisfying from start to finish.",1423872000,,898,4.460122699386503

2954096,3,B00004D2X8,"2008's ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" moves the Mummy franchise to China and the year 1947. Rick and Evie O'Connell's grown son Alex (Luke Ford) is excavating the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, an evil would-be ruler of China. The Emperor (Jet Li) and his army have been frozen in time by the curse of an ancient witch (Michelle Yeoh).

Back in England, Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Maria Bello in for Rachel Weitz) are bored with their post-war retirement and ripe for an assignment to return a rare gem to a Shanghai Museum. Once in Shanghai, they drop in on Evie's brother Jonathan (reprised by John Hanna), who is running a bar and trying vainly to keep Alex out of trouble. A fractious family reunion leads to a trip to the museum to see the coffin of the Dragon Emperor. An ambush set by Alex's unscrupulous digging partner and a renegade Chinese general releases the Dragon Emperor, and the chase is on (again).

The movie does not lack for action, although too much of the plot struggles to recapture the magic of the first two Mummy movies. The O'Connells pursue the Dragon Emperor from the streets of Shanghai through the Himalayas to the gates of the mythical Shangri-La, and finally to his Tomb. They will be assisted by an audacious Irish pilot, an immortal witch and her daughter, Yetis, and an army of the Dragon Emperor's victims. Along the way, Rick will bond with his son, and he and Evie will rediscover the thrills of two-fisted, gun-toting archeology.

The CGI effects are impressive, if overdone, while the action sequences practically tumble over each other. This viewer wishes more screen time had been devoted to solving archeological riddles. Maria Bello is adequate as Evie but she and Fraser just don't have the same chemistry. Luke Ford looks a bit old for his role, while the hilarious John Hanna doesn't get nearly enough screen time.

""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" recycles the familiar elements of the first two movies in a new and exotic location.  New viewers may find it interesting; fans of the first  two Mummy movies perhaps less so.",1423526400,,2091,4.730769230769231

Maria Bello isn't a bad actress at all; she's simply not a good Evy. Nevertheless, I still liked it. The setting was different, and many of the characters are different as well, so I suppose it was a nice change.

So for years I refused to watch it...until recently. One very early morning when my bladder woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep after using the restroom I found it on amazon instant video and decided to watch.

This is NOT the Evie and Rick we fell in love with, they completely obliterated the personalities that were already established, especially Evie. The relationship between the two completely fell flat there's no chemistry what so ever between Brendan and Maria. Speaking of...it was like Maria had never acted before. Her performance in this movie is excruciatingly painful. The jokes were juvenile and misplaced. There was one line...one out of the whole movie that felt like these were the same characters. Rick O'Connell says ""Do the words 'rest' and 'peace' mean anything to you two?""

2954173,3,B00004D2X8,"That eccentric family of adventurers lead by Brendan Fraser is back for a third go in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  I love the 1999's The Mummy, considering it one of the better action/adventure films of the last two decades.  I fell in love with the charm of cast and wanted to see more high adventure from them.  The Mummy Returns featured the same creative talent in front of and behind the camera it just felt like a weak retread of the first film.  Does this third entry return the franchise to form?  In short: no, but there's still entertainment to be found in Rick O'Connell's final fight with the undead.

 Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and the cast of supporting characters remain the best element of the franchise coming into this 2008 film.  There's some good interaction between him and his now adult son (Luke Ford) and Jonathan (John Hannah) returns as the series' comic relief.  Jet Li also makes a formidable baddie when he's actually on screen (unfortunately he seems have only been on set for less than a week and it shows by his limited screen time).

Unfortunately the script doesn't give much for these characters to do other than retread plot points from the first two films.  Really the only things new here are the Chinese setting and a brief appearance by some helpful Yetis.  The rest we've all seen before and it was done better in the previous film.

The action scenes are at times entertaining, if not particularly original.  Where they can become trying is when slow-mo decides to rear its ugly head.  This ugly aspect of the film appears whenever our characters begin fighting hand-to-hand and it just doesn't work.  This slow-mo is less Matrix bullet time and more of an artificial slow-mo option one might find in a friend's home movie.  It is just painfully obvious that the shots weren't shot with high speed cameras and were artificially slowed down in post production.

Perhaps the greatest flaw of 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' is that its antagonist feels like a step down.  Jet Li's Dragon Emperor seems to pale in comparison to Imhotep in the first two films.  While the Emperor's ability to throw fire, control ice, and transform into a three-headed dragon and ogre those powers just don't seem to hold a candle to Imhotep's.  As a result it's hard not to feel that the stakes have been lowered between films.

All and all I don't regret seeing this film even if there were many disappointing elements.  I just enjoy these characters' chemistry together and was able to look past many faults because of that.  If you're in that same boat than Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is certainly worth a rental.",1409788800,,2663,4.689655172413793

Simply put, remove Jonathan (the John Hannah character and this film gets 4 stars easily from me and so would the previous two. Jonathan's continuous knack for getting into trouble and make the wrong choices really ruins my chance to fully enjoy this movie. I do like the Brendan Fraser character as the reluctant tomb raider and I am a life long Jet Li fan. What I like most about these films is the various action sequences and varying weapons. I also like the character development of Brendan Fraser and his future possibilities.
I also like the knowledge of Rick and Evelyn's (Rachel Weisz) son Alex (Freddie Boath). But simply put if you enjoyed the first two films. You will truly enjoy this one also.",1408579200,,793,4.5524475524475525

Excellent bad guy material. There are some violent and scary moments, and if your kids don't like bugs this is NOT a good movie for them!

2954193,5,B00004D2X8,"I didn't watch this for a long time because the second one in the franchise left such a bad taste in my mouth.  Loved the first one, as I'm a lover of '30s-style adventure flicks and I thought it actually out-raidered the Indiana Jones films, but the second one eschewed all the great character interaction of its prequel and replaced it with non-stop mindless and ultimately pointless action.  So, when I finally found this in the bargain bin at Walmart, I happened to be in the mood, so I picked it up.

This one is much better than the second, though still not as good as the original, but then again, I didn't expect lightning to strike twice.  This movie falls squarely between the original and the second installment in terms of fun.  It seems to have got a lot of bad reviews and I frankly don't know why.  It's still a lot of fun.  I think one problem a lot of viewers had was the absence of Rachel Weiss, but if she didn't want to be in it, there was nothing the filmmakers could do, I suppose.  Her replacement is a very different kind of actress, but, wisely, they wrote the part for her acting style instead of trying to force her into Weiss' shoes.  The scene where she swordfights imaginary assailants in her study is something I just can't imagine Weiss doing with any conviction.  It's entertaining if you watch it for what it is.",1407628800,,1346,4.412955465587045

Spoiler-free!

The film itself is somewhat removed from the first 2 'Mummy' films, which I attribute to the face that it isn't Rachel Weisz. There are a couple moments in the film where I actually thought, ""Well, this franchise just 'jumped the shark,'"" which is too bad, I really enjoyed the first two. Minus those moments, and you'll know them when you see them, the film would be a decent third. But coupled with the absence of Ms. Weisz, it's just too much.

Still, it's a fun(ish) addition to the collection and a good popcorn muncher.",1398470400,,601,4.555555555555555

2954238,5,B00004D2X8,"As far as films made for pure entertainement go this is one of the best. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

In Thebes, Egypt, 1,290 BC, high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a handsome man well versed in the arts of occult and black magic, engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez, sculptural), the favourite concubine of Pharaoh Seti I. When the affair was discovered, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch but when Seti's guards arrived, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun killed herself. In her last words she implored Imhotep to bring her back to life with his dark magic... Those are the first two minutes and about the rest I will just say that quite fast after this introduction we are transported to Egypt in Year of Grace 1926 and then the film really begins.

This film is based on a gallery of mostly endearing or amusing characters, fast moving action and clever, witty dialogs. The main male character is an American adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), about whom we just know that he used to serve in French Foreign legion and that he is currently rotting in an Egyptian jail awaiting his execution. The main female character is Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), a young British lady currently working as librarian but who is also an amateur Egyptologist.

Important secondary characters are:

- Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah), Evelyn's brother, a kind of ne'er-do-well guy and the black sheep of his family
- Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor), a shady slimy character, a former subaltern of O'Connell before his desertion from French Foreign Legion
- Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr, impressive), a mysterious Arab warrior
- Terrance Bay (Erick Avari), Egyptologist and Library supervisor, Evelyn's boss
- Gad Hassan (Omid Djalili), the warden of Egyptian prison and man in charge of O'Connell's execution
- Mr Burns, Mr Henderson and Mr Daniels, three American adventurers,
- Dr Allen Chamberlain, a British scientist who travels with the three American adventurers
- also lots of camels and flesh eating scarabs...)))

This film very desservedly earned a great reputation and also a gazillion of dollars when released in 1999 and of course was unavoidably followed by two very, very bad sequels.

This is of course pure entertainment but it is very well done pure entertainment and the result is a funny, even merry, fast paced adventure film which can be easily watched in family (no strong language, not too scary) - rating it ""15"" is really an exaggeration. A film which can be watched numerous times and therefore worth purchasing. In one word - this film is JUICY...))) Enjoy!",1395964800,,2641,5.045871559633028
2954239,4,B00004D2X8,I recently purchased the Mummy series because it's a trilogy that is great fun.  There's a lot of action sequences with great special effects and there is an interesting plot with comedic tie-ins.  I thought I had the series in my collection but apparently I didn't.  I was happy to purchase this series.,1395964800,,304,4.69811320754717

2954242,2,B00004D2X8,"What made the Mummy work as a franchise was the character development and the chemistry the cast members had with each other.  Without Rachael Weisz and Oded Fehr (whose character would not have fit into this story anyway), the movie is not the same and ultimately does not work well at all.

This time the movie is set in 1946, in China and the Mummy is played by the awesome Jet Li.  In fact the only reason I give this even 2 stars is because of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh.  They both did a great job with their characters, and the cinematography and visual effects are great,  however there is a total lack of continuity from the rest of the story.  First you are expected to believe that Brendan Fraser has aged 26 years from the first movie without looking much older.  The kid Alex from the second movie is now grown up and has lost the British accent in favor of an American one, and is very little like how he was portrayed in the second movie.  And John Hannah is given little, if nothing, to do in this movie, and it just seems like his character is there to tag along.  I think the decision to recast the character of Evie was horrible, and they would have better off to had killed the character off than bring someone new in.  Even though I do not think Bello was horrible in the role, it just did not have the same feel as with how Weisz played her.

As far as extras go on the disc version, there are few deleted and extended scenes and a 20 min making of feature, a commentary track on the film itself and a handful of other items.  Not as much as on the first two discs, but not bad for what is there.  As I said above it was really a movie that did not have to be made.  I think the producers thought they had a much stronger franchise with the Mummy than they really did and without without all of the original cast, which they did get for The Mummy Returns, it just fell very flat.  Luckily it seems that they got that message however since no other attempts at continuing the franchise have been made.",1395532800,,2020,4.196891191709844
2954243,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a retelling of the 1930s version of the story.  It utilizes many of the same characters and story elements, but it is its own movie.  It is not a shot-by-shot remake by any means.  This version utilizes a ton of CGI animation and green screen.  It is set in the period between World War I and II, and so it blends ancient Egypt with the 1920s modern world using the technology of late the 1990s early 2000s.  It is not meant to be an accurate period piece from either ancient Egypt or early 1900s Egypt.  So if you are one who would nitpick things that are wrong, you probably want to stay away from this.

The movie itself is a blend of action, comedy and romance.  Along with somewhat cheesy drama.  In some ways it pays homage to the old monster movies, and in some ways it is a tongue in cheek spoof of them.  It has an ensemble cast of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, John Hannah, all of whom do a great job with their respective roles.  Fraser shows he has the chops to be both funny and somewhat of an action hero...Although not necessarily a larger than life one.  Hannah is great at blending being a cowardly, weasel with reluctant bravery when the need arises, so that you actually like and root for his character.  It is hard to buy Weisz as the nerdy librarian they portray her as in the beginning of the move and their attempts to make her kind of frumpy and tone down how gorgeous she really is did not work all that well.  But once they turned the character into more of a leading lady kind of role for movies like this, she worked well.

I thought Vosloo,did a fine job as the mummy, especially given that so much of his performance was based on expression as opposed to dialog.  He said very little throughout the film, and when he did it was never in English,  Regardless of that he was able to portray being menacing, smug, concerned and scared without needing to say much.

If you get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds very good.  Again the special effects are now 15 years old so some of the things are not going to be as good as in a movie made today would be.  However, it looks about as good as a movie from that time could.  There are quite a few special features, with the longest being a 50min centered on the digital effects used to create the various mummies in the movie.  There are also some deleted and extended scenes and a couple short making of features.

Do not go into this movie thinking you are about to see an academy award winning best picture or get a best actor/actress performance.  You won't.  It is purely a big budget, special effects popcorn movie.  If you look at it as a somewhat funny action/adventure movie, and if you generally like those kinds of movies then you will probably like this.",1395446400,,2773,4.325581395348837

In addition to a week fighting scene between two great legends (Yeo and Li), the story line was simply weak.  I also felt that without Rachel Weiz, the character of Evey/Evalyn didn't quite deliver.  Just a bit too cheesy for me.  But I should have known, the third installment usually is. On the bright side, the CGI is better than the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns.

2954276,1,B00004D2X8,They literally took everything about the characters from the first movies and completely made them behave and be the opposite all the sudden. AS IF Evelyn would ever have become a romance novel writer?! That couple never would have become boring and staying at home every night but for some reason this movie makes it out to seem that their whole life turned into them being boring and normal and not adventurers. They aren't true to the original characters AT ALL. Seriously so sad to see a movie chain I loved so much turned into total crap. They couldn't even find an actress to replace Weiss that was any good!! They acted like this horrible woman was Evelyn when she is everything the character we all loved wasn't. They could have at least said she died and he re-married!! I don't blame Rachel Weiss for not doing this film because the character she portrayed was just ruined in this film. I could watch the first two movies over and over again over the years and would LOVE more of them with the original cast back. But if you loved the first two this movie will only ruin them for you.,1388620800,,1094,4.475

2954281,5,B00004D2X8,"""I . . . am . . . a Librarian"" the line delivered by Rachel Weisz is only one very small but very memorable moment that becomes reason to love this movie. Ms. Weisz's performance was perfect and so damn charming, it was largely the reason I became so smitten with this movie. Brendan Fraser was just as wonderful and his performance gives this script the one two punch that makes a film into a MOVIE. These two great actors seemed like they were made for each other here, and that is what drew me in.
The rest of the cast (good guys and evil bad guys) was equally superb, the costumes, the music, the pace was great -- leaving you with the though of, ""What just happened to the last two hours?""

Not to mention the flawless special effects done almost 20 years ago qre still holding up better than modern films barring very few. And they look gorgeous. When you first see Imhotep's mummy form it is beyond jaw-dropping to the point where James Cameron and his Na'vi are hulk green with jealousy.

Lastly the sound mix is an awesome DTS-HD track that even on my less than stellar soumd system makes my house shake without the sound 3itself even being slightly distorted.

And lastly all the special features included are the same as the collector's edition I've had since 1999-2000. They aren't in HD but hey, it's not really a big deal.

2954304,2,B00004D2X8,"Vampires were hot a few years back, and zombies are hot right now. So I have to wonder if mummies will eventually get their day.

Until they get around to making a movie about a sexy teen mummy, the best example would probably be ""The Mummy,"" which adds a gruesome twist to the mummy-in-love brand of Hammer Horror. Lots of CGI, lots of over-the-top action, lots of teeth-grindingly annoying comedy, and Brendan Fraser back before he became kind of doughy and creepy looking.

Over three thousand years ago, the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) killed the pharoah when the pharoah discovered Imhotep's affair with his mistress. When Imhotep tried to resurrect his lover, he was captured and condemned to a horrifying slow death.

In the 1920s, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) is given an ancient box and map that shows the way to Hamunaptra, the ancient city of the dead. After she saves the man who had it, Rick O'Connell (Fraser), from nearly being executed, they set out on an expedition to Hamunaptra -- and quickly discover that they'll have to compete with a larger American team of archaeologists.

But when Evelyn reads a passage from The Book of the Dead, Imhotep rises from the dead -- and he begins absorbing parts and fluids from the treasure hunters to restore his body. He also unleashes the Plagues of Egypt on the nearby city. But once he's returned fully to life, Imhotep is determined to finish resurrecting his beloved, and he plans to sacrifice Evelyn's body to do it.

It's easy to understand why ""The Mummy"" is a guilty pleasure for so many people -- it feels like Stephen Sommers concocted this movie in a lab, using equal parts Hammer Horror and Indiana Jones. It feels like a movie entirely made to inspire amusement-park rides. And that's okay -- everybody needs some fun movies where you just turn your brain off and enjoy.

It has a pretty simple plot -- the heroes go to Hamunaptra, wake the mummy, and spend the rest of the film trying to kill him. Along the way we have a fairly chaste romance and lots of adventure (crashing planes, swarms of scarabs, plenty of guns), with giant swathes of CGI. And yes, it gets disgusting at times -- think scarabs crawling into people's brains, or a person who loses his eyes and tongue to Imhotep.

But honestly, it's not a very good movie. It was apparently written by someone whose only knowledge of ancient Egypt comes from the Book of Exodus. Seriously, why is the Book of the Dead a CODEX, which wasn't invented until centuries later? Why is the city assaulted by the Biblical plagues? None of it makes sense, especially since the Biblical plagues weren't from the Egyptian religion, and they occurred YEARS after Imhotep's demise!

And despite the simplicity of the plot, Sommers manages to leave giant holes in the story. For instance, Imhotep is established to be terrified of cats, who are the guardians of the underworld. Fine, sounds plausible... except that this weakness is used against him for a grand total of two seconds, then forgotten.

It also has -- God help us -- comic relief. Too much. A few one-liners would have been fine, but Sommers crams in entire scenes (Evelyn teetering on a ladder before toppling bookcases like dominoes) in an attempt to make the audience laugh. Usually they are both too long and not as funny as he thinks. The worst comic relief is Beni, an obnoxious little weasel whose entire schtick is that... he's an obnoxious little weasel. He makes Jar Jar Binks look hilarious.

I admit to never having understood the appeal of Brendan Fraser, even when he was considered hot. Here, he feels like a G-rated Indiana Jones, minus the stubble and sweat -- a passable roguish hero, but nothing particularly special. Rachel Weisz is the real revelation here -- despite a standard gutsy ingenue role, she really has an aura of intelligence and elegance about her, as well as a feeling of strength. And there are some decent performances by Oded Fehr, Erick Avari and Jonathan Hyde.

""The Mummy"" is best appreciated as brain candy -- because when you stop and think about it, your brain starts to hurt. And I pray that Stephen Sommers never, ever makes a comedy.",1380067200,,4169,4.736551724137931

Because of this, I have enjoyed this movie every time I watch it. It is fictional but the characters a developed well enough to carry the movie. There is a spiritual element to this movie that also makes it intriguing, like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Now I don't think it's as good as Raiders, but it isn't as bad as King Solomon's Mines either.

2954329,4,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor"" is great! This is how the story goes: Explorer Rick O'Connell to combat the resurrected Han Emperor in an epic that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Rick is joined in this all-new adventure by son Alex, wife Evelyn and her brother, Jonathan. And this time, the O'Connells must stop a mummy awoken from a 2,000-year-old curse who threatens to plunge the world into his merciless, unending service. Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor and his 10,000 warriors have laid forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. But when dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, the reckless young archaeologist must seek the help of the only people who know more than he does about taking down the undead: his parents. As the monarch roars back to life, our heroes find his quest for world domination has only intensified over the millennia. Striding the Far East with unimaginable supernatural powers, the Emperor Mummy will rouse his legion as an unstoppable, otherworldly force... unless the O'Connells can stop him first.

The directing by Rob Cohen (who also directed ""Stealth"" (2005), ""XXX"" (2002), ""The Fast And The Furious"" (2001), ""Daylight"" (1996), ""Dragonheart"" (1996) & ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" (1993) is great! The story and screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (both who also wrote the screen story to ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), and the stories and screenplays to ""Shanghai Knights"" (2003) & ""Shanghai Noon"" (2000) is great! The cast led by Brendan Fraser (returning as Rick O'Connell) and Jet Li (as Emperor Han) is great!

The music by Randy Edelman (who also did the music to ""Shanghai Knights"", ""XXX"", ""Shanghai Noon"", ""Daylight"", ""Dragonheart"", & ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"") is great! The cinematography by Simon Duggan (who also did the cinematography to ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007), ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006), & ""I, Robot"" (2004) is great! The film editing by Kelly Matsumoto (who also did the film editing to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006), ""Van Helsing"" (2004), & ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) & Joel Negron (who also did the film editing to ""XXX"", ""Planet Of The Apes"" (2001), & ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999) is great! The casting by Ronna Kress (who also did the casting to ""XXX"" & ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" (2007) is great! The production design by Nigel Phelps (who also did the production design to the upcoming ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"", ""The Island"" (2005) & ""Troy"" (2004) is great! The art direction by David Gaucher (who also did the art direction to ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" (2008), Isabelle Guay (supervising art director) (who also was an supervising art director on ""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), Nicolas Lepage (who also did the art direction to ""300"" (2007), ""The Fountain"" (2006), & ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"" (2002), Jean-Pierre Paquet (who also did the art direction to ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", ""300"", ""The Fountain"", & ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"") is great! The set decoration by Anne Kuljian (who also did the set decoration to ""Mr. Brooks"" (2007) & Philippe Lord (who also did the set decoration to ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" & ""The Fountain"") is great! The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays (who also did the costume design to the upcoming ""Fast And Furious"" (2009), ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006), ""XXX: State Of The Union"" (2005), ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003), ""XXX"", & ""The Fast And The Furious"") is great!

2954338,3,B00004D2X8,"Missed the original Evy.  Probably the reason for most of the negative reviews.  Moving on to China and the first Emperor was logical, since seeing a third reincarnation of Imhotep would have been even a greater stretch and a bit ho-hum.  Don't understand why it was necessary to place the period in 1949 at the time of the Chinese civil war, unless it was to create another love interest focal point between the son and the witch's immortal daughter.  The biggest suspension of belief was how General Ming could have ever been loyal to a narcissistic tyrant as Han.  But otherwise entertaining and enough attention to archaeolgical detail to pass muster.  OK, I'm a Qin Shi Huang/Qin Dynasty ""fan"" and find it a fascinating period of China's history. I can see the first Emperor being an egotistical, sadistic tyrant, intent on conquering the known world.  However, I'm still waiting for a story line that would reference the supposed curse that ""in whatsoever dynasty my tomb is desecrated, that dynasty will fall"" - the main plot line would be that of the Chinese communist party putting everything in the way of opening the emperor's tomb, and an archaeologist seeking the ultimate historical dig inadvertantly destroying a dynasty. Probably implausible, since the Chinese government would need to grant access to any dig, and that isn't likely.  But a movie can go there.  Nor likely that permission would be granted to film in China.  Any takers?  (Note: Case in point, to date, there has been no attempt under the current regime to enter the Emperor's final resting place. They have confined themselves to the periphery of the site.)",1366934400,,1640,4.927272727272728

The film Is Very entertaining in an un-scary way which is the whole point of the Film to be Effing Scary. Instead the Director Makes an Indiana jones type movie In a Friggin Horror film. I understand why he did it The Mummy doesn't really register for most people as scary. Brendan Frasiers'  wicked performance as Badass Rick O Connell is what saves this movie. He is most likable as a blend  of Han Solo with Indiana Jones. He plays a scoundrel on a treasure hunt. the movies Plot is fun but ultimately there is nothing you have not seen before in scarier films. what I like about this Film is that there is a lot of Action with Brendan Frasier playing a complete badass. the movie is not exactly good but it is not a bad film either.

2954397,4,B00004D2X8,"There's a bizarre dissconnect and hatred people seem to have with this third entry in ""The Mummy"" franchise.  Whereas on the whole, people loved the first two films, there's been an almost inexplicable backlash against this third entry in the series.  And I never understood it.  I saw it with my whole family in theaters before reading any critical or fan reviews and we all enjoyed it.  I watched it with several friends, including one who absolutely hated the second movie, and they all enjoyed it.  In fact, everyone I know outside of the internet...  Well, they all enjoyed it.  Even the hard-to-please people.  It's an enjoyable adventure-romp with a cheesy story, some cool special effects, and some very decent action sequences.  It's the same darned type of film as the first two, so it makes no sense to me why it's supposedly so much worse than the prior films.

The story is simple- Rick and Evy go to meet their son, whom has unearthed the petrified Dragon Emperor in China.  When a paramilitary group orchestrates his revival, Rick, Evy, Alex, Jonathan and their new sidekick Lin must follow and stop him from regaining his power raising his army to enslave all of mankind.

It's big, loud, stupid and a lot of fun.  Just like the first two.  Face it, people.  The first two weren't high art.  They were big, loud, dumb, fun movies.

Sure, I can nit-pick details.  I wish Rachel Weiz had returned.  I wish Stephen Sommers had directed.  But fundamentally, this isn't any worse than the other movies.  I'd even argue that it's superior to the second film, because that one was all over the place with the story and had far more visual effects just for the sake of visual effects, whereas this one is more direct and concise in terms of plot, and has far less visual effects.

The DVD/Blu-Ray also has a nice assortment of special features, with commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and some deleted scenes.  (I don't know too much about the Blu-Ray exclusive features, as I don't tend to pay attention to the U-Control features.)

All-in-all, this movie doesn't deserve the terrible reputation it has, and for open-minded fans, it's worth owning.",1353888000,,2160,4.791327913279133

2954406,3,B00004D2X8,"But it could have been so much better.

The strongest part of the story, for me, was at the very beginning during the set up for the rest of the movie. Russell Wong and Michelle Yeoh had such wonderful chemistry together and they were only on screen for the first five or so minutes. I really wish it could have been longer.

Brendan Fraser turned in another solid outing as Rick O'Connell, but John Hannah's Jonathan lacked heart; he was almost a caricature. The grown up Alex with an American accent and the non-Brit Maria Bello portraying Evie, using a very uneven British accent, were the weakest parts in this movie.

I wish the screen writers had let Alex age naturally, using Freddie Boath again and written a script that wouldn't have forced Rachel Weisz to back out.

All in all the movie was worth two stars, but Russell Wong and Michelle Yeoh's chemistry earned it a third.

I would strongly suggest renting this movie first, not buying, so you can decide for yourself if it's worth owning.",1342396800,,1001,4.601123595505618

I didn't quite buy the change of wife from the previous movies but the actress was fine.  I know they can't always get the same people. This was a little more fun, more lighthearted, than the second movie which we also liked, and it seemed a little shorter, which we liked A LOT.

Firstly, I am not into fiction movies a lot, I enjoy hardcore dramas and gore/thriller/horror genre a lot, but 'The Mummy' is exceptional, trust me. Right from the beginning you get involved in the rich scenario of ancient eqypt followed by the scenes in which we are introduced to Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. The chemistry between Fraser and Weisz is nothing less than extraordinary, you are easily glued to the couple on screen and what makes the whole atmosphere more delightful is a wonderful performance from John Hannah. Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo deliver terrific performance and the entire cast make a perfect team work to make this film outstanding. There are very rare films who give a decent balance between gore, horror, drama and humor, this film is undoubtedly one of them and hats off to Stephen Sommers for a stunning direction.

The audio is also top notch with Surrounds in all the right places and Jerry Goldsmith's score just booming.  I don't remember this film ever looking so good, especialy in DVD format in that ""Mummy Trilogy"" box set.  If anything this Blu is worth the upgrade even if you only spent $20 on the 3 film DVD set.  Can this disc look better, well any film could.

The second one, Mummy II, I could get past the ads by picking ""scene 1"" instead of ""play"", now I have to mute the TV and go occupy myself with other projects.....it takes around 10 minutes before the ads run out and I can actually watch the movie.

That being said, it is not going to completely change your world, but it is one of the best pulpy action films out there. It has some good cheeky comedy, some cool action, and is about a mummy with magical powers and it doesn't really suck. It feels like a modern update of those older pulp films of the 30's and 40's that help capture you and takes you on an adventure. I definitely give it a positive review.",1335571200,,506,4.173469387755102
2954413,4,B00004D2X8,"I bought the Blu-Ray edition of ""The Mummy"" about a year and a half ago, and it is a great disc!

I had already owned a VHS copy of the film and the 2-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD.  The Blu-Ray release essentially includes MOST of the features from the 2-Disc DVD (Although I think some of the text-based special features may have been omitted, but I'm not 100% on that, just don't remember seeing them in the menu), plus a few new featurettes, mainly advertisments for the third film.

The picture quality is very nice.  The image is a lot sharper, and some of the effects look more detailed and lifelike.  (Particularly the opening shot of the Sphinx being built)  In addition, the desert photography (mainly the gorgeous dunes) benefit dramatically from the sharper image and more vibrant colors.  It honestly looked better to me on this Blu-Ray than I remember it looking in the theater.  Definitely worth the upgrade to Blu-Ray!  Looks a LOT better than the DVD did.

Sound is also great, and sounds a little bit clearer and sharper than the DVD release.

The film itself is also great fun!  A fun adventure with elements of romance and a touch of horror!

2954418,5,B00004D2X8,"I really really really liked this movie, THIS is what the second movie should have been like. Some say Brendan Fraser mailed in a lame performance, I disagree. Yes, Rachel Weisz declined to do this movie. My opinion, they should have said she died, and that Brendan's and Maria Bello's character fall in love. There was chemistry there, And I have to say. I enjoyed her a whole lot better than Rachel's interpretation of the character, the cow in the plane scene. Yeah, again could've done without it. But as a whole, Jet-Li is the scariest Mummy. Plus it's set in China, where yes, there are mummies there too. I think the major problem with this movie, is that by the time this movie came out, people had gotten tired of the series. And all they saw was Brendan Fraser as Dudley Doo right, and that's a shame. Because this movie was much much much better than the second one. And to answer a negative reviewer, the o'connells boy is now a tombraider of sorts, kind of like his dad. And as they're tracking the mummy in the mountains, he tells his mother that he's not a virgin. She asks him ""oh really how many"", now some have taken that as to say that she was crazy in a perverse way. But in reality, she was trying to keep her family together. And when she asked that question, it was more of a shocked, and then wanting to find out, to immediatley it's none of my business. I think this movie gets dumped on unfairley, this was a very good movie.",1327708800,,1451,4.357933579335794

WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT!!!!!, this movie delivers in more ways than one. In response to one reviewer, I've seen the original Mummy movie, woooooooooooooow, I had a hard time trying to keep from getting bored. All they did, was update the movie, story and all. This time the Mummy is actually scary, he actually looks like he came back from the dead. And the scarabs, they are a character in this movie all by themselves. Surprise surprise surprise, when you give Brendan Fraser a very good script, and don't ask him to do too much. He's a very good actor, there is chemistry between him and Rachel weisz. The only update on the story, is that instead on Imhotep falling in love with A queen named Anucksananum, it's the pharoe's mistress. I won't rehash the plot, I like the fact that Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'connell as a man of action. It's not even close to boring, I enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well directed, and very well acted.",1327708800,,1058,4.458762886597938

The acting wasn't horrible but Maria Bello (Whom I normally like) wasn't the right fit to play the part, I like everyone else was disappointed Rachel didn't come back but even so I feel like Maria didn't do the part right sadly but Maria wasn't the reason this movie was bad, the story line and plot cause have been better, the action scenes weren't that great or special effects and it takes way to long for the movie to get started not to mention after things start happening its still boring. Bottom line this movie should have gone straight to video or better yet never should have been made, Its completely predictable as well and don't get me started on how much of a bad idea the yetis or bigfoots were lol catch it on tv or rent it for a dollar but that about all its worth and if your watching cause your bored beware you'll only be more bored by the end and if you weren't bored then im sorry that you will be by the end.

Would advise anyone who likes horror movies to grab this one and when it arrives, microwave some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy it.  Make sure to pause it for bathroom breaks and phone calls - there are so many little details you'll miss if you leave the room.

The acting is awesome (despite the loss of Rachel Weisz), it has bravura set pieces, quotable dialog, great special effects, cool stunts, lots of clever humor and jokes and an amazing film score by Randy Edelman . Almost a perfect movie in every sense. It's a non-stop action packed adventure, and that is my favorite kind of movie. I enjoy the other films in the Mummy trilogy, but for some reason, this one has always been my favorite, regardless to what people say about it. My favorite scenes from the movie are the battle at the end, and the battle in the Himalayas. There both really cool, and have some really cool uses of special effects. I also loved when the emperor transformed in to various beasts / monsters (3 headed dragon, giant horned creature, etc.). Some of my favorite lines from the film were: ""Welcome to the twentieth century!"" and ""Enough tricks! where's your honor? fight like a man!"" I've watched this movie countless times growing up and it never fails to enthrall and entertain me.

Great special effects, not a bad plot, and decent acting make this enjoyable to watch.  Rachel Weisz selected not to be in this movie, her replacement Maria Bello does a good job as the wife of Brenden Fraser in the movie.

And after reading all those negative reviews of the third film, this ""Tomb of The Dragon Emperor"", I decided to watch it first before I watch the more popular two.

And, I'd have to say that it's not so terrible.  As it's own film, it's just as good as any Indiana Jones film, in fact, I think this one film is better than Indiana Jone's Last Crusade and especially the last Indiana Jones film of ""Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" since this theme seems to be rather similar.

So, I'm glad I watched this episode of ""The Mummy"" first, because I haven't allowed my opinion to be tainted by expecting a plausible extension of the appeal of the first two.

I took into consideration I was over anticipating a great sequel after the first two movies and might have expected too much after all the hype. But this movie truly stinks! Screwed the pooch with the plot and should have stayed with the successful formula of the first two. It reeks from lackluster to boring performances by all involved. David Calder who gets his head cut off actually deserves it in this one. A wonderful classically trained actor reminiscent of a Sydney Greenstreet couldn't even help this script! Throw into the mix a crappy soundtrack, lousy chemistry, horrible camera work jumping all over the place back and forth straining ones eyeballs, blurry images and undefined closeups. Dark lighting throughout. Special effects were a cross between Touchstone's Who Framed Roger Rabbit,and Tim Burton's Batman. Too bad this movie couldn't hold a candle to either one of them. Sorry Brendan I needed a gas mask to even view your performance that I have genuinely enjoyed in just about all your prior works up until this one. Your Replacement wife looks more like she should have played your mother and had me yawning more then a 42 hour after the party  hang over with no sleep. Two enjoyable entertaining interesting plots, decent acting, fast moving explosive movies in the first two then this albatross. Stay away from this at all cost.

2954437,4,B00004D2X8,"As a fan of the first two Mummy movies as well as the take off the ""Scorpion King"" there is a sense of let down but the 3rd in the Mummy series is not all that bad.  However, I would have preferred the movie to be shot in the area of the first two Mummy's but archeologists do travel from one ancient site to another.  To me, what has caused the most disappointments, is the extreme relocation from dessert to snow and ice.  If there were not two prior Mummy films and the 3rd in the series was the first Mummy, it would have been much more accepted.  Squeals always suffer the dogma of not being as good as its predecessor and the 3rd Mummy movie is no exception.  So, if you are able to dismiss the 3rd Mummy from the first two films, you will enjoy the movie.  Also, the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor's special affects are as good as the original Mummy flicks. I do not know where the theory that the special affects were poor could be rooted.  The special affects, for their geographical location, were excellent. Best advice: Rent it and then watch it.

But the opening scene takes place in ancient Thebes,and there's a Pyramid and the Sphinx. Perhaps I'm being a little nitpicky, but hello?!? The Pyramids and the Sphinx are in Giza. Then later,Evelyn is talking about the process of mummification, and she says ""...and then they take out your heart."" (which they would leave in). And there were five canopic jars when there should have been four. The list goes on. All these gaffes could be excused if the director didn't know any better, but from what I've read,he consulted with an Egyptologist for the film.

Next, slapstick fly fishing!?  (This is where they lost me.)
Then, the introduction of a new actress playing Evelyn O'Connell (in an entirely different manner than the original actress, Rachel Weisz).  Eh, I've seen better....Rachel Weisz!
And!  Alex O'Connell is now all grown up (without his British accent).  He's a bit of a dope; his parents have become stuffy and boring.  The ne'er-do-well uncle/brother has been relegated to comic relief and a constant annoyance.  The family melodrama is tedious and dull.  It takes forever before something even remotely exciting takes place (too little too late).  The dialog is corny (""we've got to put this mummy down fast!"").  I'd rather they did something with the dialog instead!  This was a poor excuse to revive a series that should have stayed put the way it was (loved the first movie, tolerated the second).

2954446,3,B00004D2X8,"To start off, I never even knew there was a third movie of this series.  Until last week I saw it at our library.  At first I was excited for another one because I enjoyed the first two.  Then I realized, why have I not heard of this?

Low and behold, three days later I had the chance to watch it and completely understood why I had never seen or heard of this flick.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not terrible...but it's certainly not good either.  This movie seems like it was made more for the actors to enjoy another mummy escapade than for the viewer.

Jonathan is still the self-centered, in-it-for-the-riches kind of guy, only enhanced with a few one-liners that you could only expect him to say. Evy is a completely different actress, which takes a leap away from the originals and it shows.  Smart career choice for original Evy.  Alex looked a lot older than he should have, but seemed to have the character's mindset.  Rick's role is portrayed alright, but Brenden Frasier just doesn't seem as into it.  None of these main characters stay in character very well through the whole movie.

I did however very much enjoy Michelle Yeoh in the film though and wish she could have been a bigger part of it!  Isabella Leong was a different pace too and helped tye the two time settings together.

The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a completely different realm of mummy movies, and not nearly as powerful.  There are some amusing son/father gun scenes.  Never thought I would see Yetis, though you just have to love them.  There are a few ""are you serious"" and ""did they really just do/say that"" that really takes you out of movie land, but if you want something for listening to in the background or a little different from the first two, this has it's little ""ha ha""s throughout the show.

But I found it to definitely be a better film than many reviewers made it out to be. There's fun action, Fraser is always likable and charming, and the movie moves along at a nice pace.

One thing I have to say is that, even though the movie is called The Mummy, and the villain is often referred to like that, he's not. He is a corpse, it's true. And there are plenty of other fighting corpses. But a mummy has very specific rules for what makes it a mummy. That being said, it's only really a minor thing. There's still plenty of other fun to be had and they couldn't very well change the name of this entry in the series to be ""The Strangely Active Dead Guy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"". The series is called The Mummy, so that's what they had to use.

Still, it's not up to the same level as the first two, but I found it more enjoyable than The Scorpion King. Take that for what it's worth.",1296864000,,998,4.060913705583756

This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.
That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating.

2954455,4,B00004D2X8,"Set several years later than the second Mummy movie, ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" gives us exciting action sequences and fights, along with an interesting battle between two reanimated forces to top things off. Maria Bello takes over the role of Evie, Rick's love and wife, and I think may have better chemistry with Brendan Fraser (at least in the stage of long time married couple), than Rachel Weisz did. I very much liked Rachel in the role in the first two movies, but her agent reportedly said of this one that ""Rachel will NEVER play the role of the mother of a grown son!"" I personally think that was a mistake, as film today is full of mature female characters in exciting and sexy roles. That attitude was more at home in the 1940s than in the 21st century. Maria Bello is charming and believable in the role, and with her performance I quickly forgot that it wasn't Rachel Weisz ... probably a second reason why it was a bad idea for Rachel to turn down a blockbuster role ... for what?

Brendan Fraser is his normal mummy-slaying self. There is nothing new from him in this role, but if you enjoyed the first two films, you really need nothing new from him in this one. He is heroic and entertaining in the role, and that's what we were looking for here.

Luke Ford is competent and exciting as the now grown son, Alex. He and Isabella Leong develop a believable chemistry after a rocky start to their relationship.

Here we have an ancient Chinese Emperor coming back to life, with the immediate goal of restoring his army along with him so that he may rule the world. I think that calling him a mummy might have been a bit of a stretch, but he does indeed provide an evil and formidable foe for our heroes to deal with. I found the story to have a few surprising choices, which is rare in an action/adventure/monster story. Cool elements such as yetis battling a modern Chinese army abound, and as mentioned above, the ultimate battle between reanimated CGI armies is both interesting and well rendered.

I understand that there are a lot of fans of the first two movies that found this one lacking. I do agree that the first was the best, as is often the case in a series. However, I think the third installment measures up very well as compared to the second. I look to be entertained by an action film, and I certainly was here. The picture and sound on the Blu-ray is outstanding, which helps a lot all in itself! LOL",1295049600,,2435,4.440715883668904

Jet Li stars as the Dragon Emperor. Wasn't he supposed to be done with films?

The story goes, Rick O'Connell's son is all grown up and following in his parent's footsteps. He's in China digging up dead people when he discovers the Dragon Emperor.

There are the token villains who want to bring the Emperor back to life and the O'Connells have to bring the crazy people back where they came from.

This third film has some special effects that we didn't see in the first two films. This mummy has some crazy abilities. He can turn into a three-headed dragon, some kind of monster cat and he can shoot fire from his hands.

The filmmakers tried to add ""kiddie"" humor in the story and it just made the dialogue worse.

2954461,3,B00004D2X8,"I loved The Mummy I.  I hated the Mummy 2: Scorpion King - which saw the series descend into theme park ride chicanery.  I wasn't expecting much from The Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor - but I was pleasantly surprised when the film started off strongly with a bang - taking its audience from Ancient China to 20th century Shanghai.

With slam-bang action, sweeping visuals, pace, sharp visuals...Director Rob Cohen does a good job of manning the helm.  This is pretty much saturday matinee theatre pulp fiction for a new generation.

For one thing, this was leaps and bounds better than Indiana Jones 4; Tomb Raider and other adventurer attempts.  To set it in China was definitely inspired as well, although the Chinese people didn't appreciate the liberties taken with their history.

The film gets a little loose later on - as the stakes never quite remain as high as we need them to be for some reason.  You feel like the filmmakers are holding on to the PG version of events as opposed to making it work for both an adult and young audience.  So some hokeyness creeps in dialogue-wise, and that is where the film despite resplendent visual fx - loses its grip.  The characters never quite rise to the fore and the zombie terracotta warriors end up being more Jar Jar Binks than terrifying, so that's another problem.  The Yetis are also overly nimble and friendly  like Wookees on steroids.

Jet Li's character could have certainly been more menacing as well - a wasted opportunity.  He just snarls and gnarls. Several ""what-if"" scenarios start to enter the viewer's mind.  Make me care! was what I was thinking.  But what we get is more fx.

The other criticism is that Brendan Fraser has to share the leading role with his screen son - and he isn't even looking like a dad of a grown man yet.  Maria Bello makes an equitable sideways replacement for Rachel Weisz.

Honestly, if it were possible, I'd have Daniel and his director Rob Cohen sent to jail!  What they have done here drags what's left of film culture into the mud.  These guys are to movies what Madoff is to finance.

2954466,1,B00004D2X8,"For whatever reasons, I truly enjoy the first two movies of this series, so much so that I still watch them rather frequently. They are always the go-to movies if I just feel like watching something to entertain me but nothing around me is tickling my fancy. Fraser and Weisz have amazing chemistry, the plot is exciting, and the side characters are hilarious...not to mention the hot as hell-fire desert man from Deuce Bigelow fame.

So then there was news of the 3rd installment. At this point I was working toward my college degree, but I was just as thrilled as the first time I heard about it. Rejoicing all over the place. Then my little bubble got burst. Rachel Weisz would not be cast as Edie in this movie.

She was offered the role, for sure, but turned it down because of a bad script. I was really upset with this woman at first and then I saw the mistake, I mean movie, which she wisely chose not to touch with a 10 foot pole. What a piece of garbage. Not only did the plot seem completely contrived, it had hardly any continuity from the previous movies. How did Alex go from being a child around 10 to a person who looks to be 30 in the couple of years between these movies? Where did his British accent go and how did it turn into an American one while he was digging around in China? Who is the psychopath that thought replacing Weisz with Maria Bello would be in any way okay? What happened to Edie being Egyptian? For goodness sake, it seems like they didn't even try to pick someone who could hold up that part with any integrity. It just seems like they picked the first available actress who would do it for the cheapest (Maria Bello's career isn't exactly stellar so I'm sure it didn't take much at all to get her on board). Weisz was fiesty and captivating, where Bello is vanilla and honestly just seems lost in the movie. Its like Rob Cohen just wanted to crank out another film as quickly and cheaply as possible, regardless of what effect it would have on the integrity of the product he is pushing. I honestly think that if Fraser's career wasn't in such a slump he would have turned down the role as well (which I would have LOVED so we could just pick up from the 2nd movie when a director with an actual sense of what is good could take on the franchise). But no... now we are stuck trying to work around that disaster of a movie.

What is really sad is that they already have plans for the Mummy 4: Rise of the Aztecs, with 5 and 6 waiting in the wings. Maria Bello (having nothing better to do) has already signed on for all of them. Its a tragedy. Now we all get to sit by and watch Rob Cohen run this franchise into the ground, taking whats left of poor Fraser's career with it. This franchise could have been really great. It would have been the Indiana Jones of my generation...now it will never live up to the potential it once had. Fraser is the only thing left breathing life into these movies, and he is the one who is going to shoulder the blame for the rest of them bombing because he pretty much IS the franchise....its terrible.

The only way it could be saved is this:
Someone, for God's sake, take the reigns from Rob Cohen's hands. Basically pretend like the 3rd movie didn't happen, bring back Weisz, find someone (much younger and better at acting!) who could actually be Rick and Edie's son, and for the love of all things holy stop making Alex the focus of the movie. Rick is the best character, there haven't even been enough movies to start ""passing the torch"" to his kid yet, geez. I mean c'mon Rob Cohen, couldn't you have tried just a little bit? This movie franchise is going to crumble in your fingers, Rob, because you decided it was better to lose one of the MAIN TWO CHARACTERS who CARRIED the movies because you were too cheap and lazy to find better writers, and wanted to make a quicker buck than have a high quality movie which could endure for years to come.

I won't be back to watch any more Mummy movies....after that third one I doubt I'll even bother renting them. I'm happy without wasting a whole two hours of my life. I'll just have to keep watching the first two and hoping that some day, years down the line, some director will realize how much of a mistake this was and re-do the series.

It is up to the O'Connell family to save the day. Rick's son Alex is now an adult, played by sexy Luke Ford, who helps his dad in the battle against the forces of evil. Roger Ebert stated that this is ""the best in the series"". The DVD comes with exteded and deleted scenes, commentary, and more.",1271721600,,956,4.730538922155689
2954469,2,B00004D2X8,"The original ""Mummy"" with Boris Karloff was not so much a horror film (though it had horrific elements) as a drama about a dead Egyptian trying to bring his belov&eacute;d back to life. Karloff's performance is typical of his work, with strong characterization and a refusal to overplay. Karloff was at his most menacing when he was at his most subtle. *

Universal's attempt to reboot the ""Mummy"" franchise (the original series having produced some of the most God-awful films I've ever seen) is a major misfire. Stephen Sommers talks of ""honoring"" the earlier films, but he dishonors the original with a ""remake"" that isn't remotely as good.

Rudely stated, Sommers has no idea of how to make an effective horror and/or action film. You can't expect to frighten the audience with a persistently tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top tone. This tone is set at the beginning when Rachel Weisz knocks over a dozen huge bookcases, and never recovers. (The film, not Weisz.) It's there merely for the sake of a laugh, and has nothing to do with Weisz's character (who is /not/ portrayed in the rest of the film as clumsy or ineffective). There's nothing wrong with humor as a tension-breaker -- but it has to be /earned/, by actually /establishing/ tension in the first place. This problem could, in principle, be fixed with a rewrite -- but not when the director is also the writer.

What's far worse is that Sommers has no understanding of ""pace"" or ""focus"". If you want to genuinely thrill the audience, you have to at least /occaisionally/ slow down so that you can build up again. A roller coaster that's /always/ fast is no fun. Whatever ""The Mummy"" is, it's /not/ a roller-coaster ride.

Like too many films, ""The Mummy"" moves at a persistently brisk -- and ultimately boring -- speed. This results in Sommers glossing over moments that ought to have the audience on the edge of its collective seat. For example, when Weisz opens the Black Book and reads the invocation that inadvertently reanimates Imhotep, IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MOMENT IN THE FILM, when it /should/ be played up for all it's worth. You can't do this without preparing the audience, and that isn't possible when you're rushing along. I've never directed a movie, but I know /exactly/ how to do this -- with the appropriate dialog, camera angles, use of close-ups, music, etc., because I've seen it done many times by infintitely-better directors. **

Sommers rips off Ray Harryhausen, but apparently has never bothered to study Harryhausen's films. RH believed in the ""slow build"", both in the film as a whole, and within sequences. In ""Jason and the Argonauts"", seven skeletons pop out of the ground to wreak havoc. Harryhausen slowly /builds/ the scene -- and ratchets up the tension -- until it explodes. In ""The Mummy""'s comparable scene, with priest mummies popping out of the ground, there is no tension and release. They just pop out.

Stephen Sommers is an incompetent director, the $400M gross of this film notwithstanding. ""The Mummy"" is a film to be watched once, as an object lesson in how /not/ to make such films, then put aside.

* When asked if he was bothered at being typecast, William Henry Pratt replied that it assured him of a paycheck. He earned that paycheck with performances he never needed to apologize for. Who says that because you're starring in a horror film, you're not obliged to act well? Pratt did.

** Hitchcock comes to mind. In ""Psycho""'s shower scene, Mrs Bates doesn't just pop in and knife Marion -- the sequence /builds/ to the murder. Similarly, the scene in which Marion's sister enters the fruit cellar, walks over to Mrs Bates, and puts her hand on the old woman's shoulder, has a terrific payoff that /the entire film/ has been building up to.",1271548800,,3766,4.809891808346213

Brendan Frasier seems obviously unimpressed with everything throughout the movie. It's always a bummer in a movie series when the usual actor for a reoccurring character has to replaced. Rachel Weisz doesn't return as Evie this time, and the replacement brings none of the humor, intelligence or vulnerability to the role. John Hannah does return but bad writing and the lack of Rachel Weisz to play off of make him less likable this time. The chemistry between Rick and Evie is broken in the same way.

2954478,4,B00004D2X8,"I didn't see all of this movie until recently-- only snatches. When it originally came out in the theaters in 1999, it looked like a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" rip-off and the reviews were bad. Then, as now, I considered ""Raiders"" to be the closest thing to a perfect movie there would ever be, so I wasn't about to entertain lesser imitators. 11 years later, having let down my guard a bit, I have to say The Mummy was an awesomely good time. Brendan Fraser is a sweet hero. There's an openness about his Rick that you don't usually see in action leads. Rachel Weisz is perfect as the plucky, klutzy smart girl, in classic movie actress fashion. There's a lot of humor, which I believe is the only way to make an action movie click. I'm sorry I was such a snob. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

In the DVD extras, please don't miss the behind the scenes look at the battle between the mummy army and Rick as he saves Evelyn.

2954481,1,B00004D2X8,"...you might consider taking her word for it. Especially if she's Rachel Weisz. And especially if she was part of the ensemble that made the first two 'Mummy' films work. Needless to say, she was not involved in this film, citing the script. Knowing that ahead of time, I should have taken her word for it, like the filmmakers ought to have, and avoided it like a plague. Instead, I suffered through the 2 hours of this disgrace to film. The things that went wrong with this movie are too many to state in one review, so I'll state the worst of the offenses:

Casting Maria Bello. Granted, she's replacing Rachel Weisz, an impossible job for any actress. But casting this actress? Who looks/sounds/acts NOTHING like Weisz at ALL is just cheap, unintelligent, and degrading. She tries, certainly, but she has to try hard, and with everything, and fails--her British accent (she's from Pennsylvania) slips and falls constantly, her chemistry with Brendan Fraser is non-existent, and she is completely unbelievable as the once tough-as-nails in-the-Princess-Leia-vein Evie O'Connell. (Oh, and by the by, writers: Evie fictionalized their adventures to sell as stories? Please. We saw the house they had; they were in no trouble for money, and would never EVER go around selling stories like that. It was good film-making when they treated events as ""Oh, not this AGAIN!"" It is bad film-making when they go ""Oooh, I can write another story off this!"". Come. ON.)

Leaving Egypt/Dropping Oded Fehr. At this point in the series, both were established elements, one as the perfect setting (mysticism, sweeping vistas, and lots and lots of mummies) and the other as the righteous warrior Medjai, Ardeth Bai. Honestly, the filmmakers could have gotten away with dropping one or the other--but not both, especially not with the humor (something this film desperately lacked) that having an Egyptian warrior in China could have provided.

Casting Luke Ford. I genuinely don't know what could have possibly been going on at that casting office. First, they take a character who is established as very British--born, raised, and accented--and make him the worst kind of John Wayne-stereotyped American. Second, cast an Australian actor to play this now-Americanized Alex O'Connell, and have him use a John Wayne voice to complete the stereotype. I think even Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin, two of America's dumbest men, would look at that and go, ""yeeeeesh, bad idea.""

Wasted Talent. Michelle Yeoh?! Jet Li?! Two of the best actors I've seen, and they were squandered. Both are skilled artists, capable of playing amazing characters, and here they play the worst kind of wooden cariacatures imaginable. A witch who somehow manages to learn English, buy clothes, raise a daughter, and still watch over the Emperor's Tomb without ever leaving once? A terracotta'd corpse that has mastery over the elements, yet only uses them two or three times? The sheer unbelievability and imbecility of this story should've been warning signs to these two actors.

The Script. Oh. Dear. Lord. The two who wrote this film (Alfred Gough and Miles Millar) are brilliant guys. Really, they are. They know how to write compelling characters (the TV series 'Smallville') write for humor (Jackie Chan's 'Shanghai Noon' & 'Shanghai Knights' films)and action/drama (Millar contributed to 'Spider-Man 2' and 'Iron Man'). So what in hell happened here? The characters are flatter than pressed leaves--even the once-humorous and likable Rick O'Connell is dull and uninteresting, despite Fraser's efforts to make it work. The storyline is at once absurdly over-the-top and also poorly underdone (Shangri-La...consists of a cave and a fountain? Yeti...are used in a single sequence and then abandoned? Two mummy armies...that the script ignores [a huge potential for action/comedy] to focus on the characters it has forced us to not care about?) The dialogue is pathetically childish and painfully unfunny. Even John Hannah's Jonathan, always good for a laugh, falls completely flat.

Honestly, if Amazon let me give a 0-star rating, I would have. Please, save yourselves: don't borrow this movie out of the library, don't rent it, and for God's sake, don't buy it. If possible, destroy it; watching the disc melt, crack and explode in a fire would be a far better use of the disc, your time, and be more entertaining in 2 minutes than this movie's 2 hours.",1262476800,,4418,5.11218836565097

Starving people all around the world could have been fed on the money it took to make this drivel.  When Rachel Weisz turned down the role that should have been the end of it, but no... they just kept right on dragging themselves deeper into the pit of insanity by recasting the role with a new actress who lacks all of the charm - no pretending Evy didn't live or stayed home this time.  We aren't idiots.  The film makers, on the other hand, evidently are.  The first two movies were great fun.  We prefer to pretend this third doesn't even exist.  It will never be a part of our collection.  We would rather pay more money per film to own only the first two on blu-ray than to pay less per film to get the box set of three (though if the box set offered the Scorpion King and the first two Mummy movies we'd be ok with that, as an earlier DVD box set release did).",1261353600,,986,4.152631578947369

Mummy 3 is no different.  There are a lot of fun, great action, and good special effects.  It was fun, maybe dumb fun, but fun nonetheless.  Sure, there are flaws.  Rachel Weisz is sorely missed, and while her replacement is fine, the lack of the original character is noticeable.  Also, the son, now a full grown man, has switched accents, and has some unexplained resentment to his father, which feels it was done for plot purposes.  Also, its amazing how little Jack has aged in the span of the three movies.

Bello had her own interpretation of the character and she delivered. Jet Li was an interesting choice for a mummy and I wish the actual actor featured more in it but the few scenes he was in were good, but the Emperor seemed to be a stronger villain than Imhoptep. Though the emotional conflict which Imhotep possessed is missed. Michelle Yeoh, again for the few scenes she was in were good, the fight with Jet Li being the best. The supporting cast however is where this movie fails. The supporters of the villain (along with their goal) is too generic, the son doesn't even resemble the character from the second film and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter is stiff. But the special effects are excellent, the final sequence being the standout. The chase in Shanghai is good but drags a bit.

Now, Director Rob Cohen takes over the franchise, and while its not quite as brilliant as the first two, it's still fun and has its moments.
Brendan Frazer returns as Rick, intrepid adventurer and Maria Bello now takes over the role of Evelyn, since now Oscar winner Rachel Weisz didn't want to be part of the franchise again (I missed her sexy presence). This time, our heroes battle an ancient Chinese warlord bent on world conquest (oh, what fun). Jet Li plays the villian. Luke Ford plays Rick and Evelyn's son, now all grown up.

In this, probably the ""scariest"" out of the three, we have the prologue that explains Imhotep's backstory and motivations then jump to Brendan Fraser's (another favorite actor of mine) character with the French Foreign Legion defending the City of the Dead in 1923 then jump another three years where we're introduced to Rachel Weisz's character and the rest of the story. A remake, and I use the term loosely, of the 1932 classic, so some story elements remain the same. Imhotep however gets an upgrade. From a walking corpse to his fully regenerated self, he possesses super-human abilities and can summon the ten plagues of Egypt. Fraser and Weisz have a chemistry together reminiscent, I think anyway, of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg of The Avengers. John Hannah as Weisz's greedy brother Jonathan and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, O'Connell's cowardly ""friend"" are the comic relief in this but are nonetheless entertaining. Arnold Vosloo is great as Imhotep, ably conveying a sense of menace and tortured romance. A small bit part of a retired RAF Col., Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay from Bewitched) is funny and charming when he talks about not going down in a blaze of glory like his comrades.

This movie is no exception, but something about it is more appealing to me compared to all those Indiana Jones and James Bond films. The visual effects are pretty stunning, I know that much. The snowmen/ape creatures were unique, the transformations involving the main mummy were VERY well done and looked stunning to be completely honest, and the story was good enough that I'd call it enjoyable.

Even the army of creatures with swords that we saw at the end of the movie were pretty fun, though it was hard to believe only a few people were able to take ALL of them out, haha. But they were so WEIRD looking, and every time their heads would be chopped off I'd sit there amazed how cool it looked. This is one beautiful movie.

Maybe I should check out more movies with a similar feel and style and not just write them off as ""terrible"" so quickly, because honestly, these kind of storylines CAN in fact be enjoyable given some time to adjust to the overall whacky style the writers must have been going for.

'The Mummy Returns' was pretty bad, almost causing me to not even give this third outing a look. Since it came on cable I decided to give it a shot.

The film starts out promising with a cool set up in China, but soon after the opening credits role it goes downhill. The makers of these films try forcing so many comedic elements into them; it takes all tension away and actually slows the pace of the film down. This film could have been pretty good, if it was played a little more serious. In fact if they deleted the entire ridiculous comedy and uninspired romances scenes out, it would play much better. It's very frustrating to see a good idea gone so terribly wrong.

To make matters worse the CGI is unconvincing most of the time and having Yeti make goal post GOOD signs with their arms is nothing short of ludicrous! This film and all of the films in the series should have been played straight. It's a shame that some films makers don't seem to have a clue that stupid jokes are never welcomed or any ""cojones"" for that matter to make a film that isn't going to appeal to an age group too young to see this film any way!

It felt like they were trying to put too much information into one adventure.  The plot didn't allow the viewers to get to know the characters enough to really relate to them.

Sometimes the acting and script is a little too cheesy, and the John Hannah character can be very annoying (he plays Rachel Weisz' brother in the film), but the filmmakers were obviously going for the Indiana Jones ""matinee"" feel so it's forgivable.

It's not like the first two Mummy films were great films, but the cast exuded low-key charm and the adventures were fun enough; in the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, by contrast, the cast (conspicuously missing Rachael Weisz) goes through the emotions of the ridiculous screenplay while third-rate CGI dominates the back of the screen and everyone watching the film wonders why they even bothered.",1245369600,,412,5.0588235294117645
2954515,3,B00004D2X8,"Well contrary to some peoples opinions, I quite liked it. Having recently watched a program on the first emperor Qin Shi Huang Di I can see where many of the plot lines on the Emperor come from and as a piece of escapist tosh it's OK. But it really isn't as good as it should have been:-
1. The new Evie hasn't got the deftness of touch that Rachel Weisz had and as a result the light hearted banter between her and Rick that was such fun in the first two movies and lifted them out of the ordinary just falls flat here. Whatever her acting abilities may be Maria Bello can't do Evelyn O'Connell.
2. Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li are woefully underutilized.
3. Alex who was English in the second movie is suddenly very American, go figure.
4. The music in the first two movies was grandiose overblown almost in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia, it added hugely to the ambiance. The soundtrack to Dragon King is just by the numbers, totally anonymous and adds nothing.
5. Transportation, the aircraft used is a Bristol Beaufighter, a two seat strike fighter noted for its cramped accommodation, chances of fitting six people and a yak in one without first passing them through a liquidizer is nil. Still I suppose it's an improvement on a jet propelled balloon.
6. The Dragon kings Dragon form looks rather too much like King Ghidorah from the Godzilla movies and very little like a Chinese Imperial dragon.

What's the moral of this, well I suppose when your script causes sufficient problems that one of the stars drops out and you can't get the proven Director on board, it really is time to pause and rethink. Ploughing ahead bull headed leaves you with a second rate product, an angry clientle and possibly a dead franchise. Maybe if some film execs could actually bring themselves to consider their own fallibility and leave a proven product in the hands of those that know how to do it properly we'd have fewer sucky sequels.",1244332800,,1929,4.57514450867052
2954516,1,B00004D2X8,"You would think after all the truly disastrous sequels that have been done over the years, that movie makers would learn one basic rule; if you have to replace a primary character because the actor/actress is unavailable, either write the character out of the script or simply don't do the movie.  You'd think that Brendon Fraser would have known this lesson as he skillfully avoided the horror that was ""George of the Jungle 2"".  How many otherwise promising sequels have be ruined because the producers decided it was better to take short cuts?  This is my first and biggest gripe about ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"".

I won't reiterate all the details of this movie and it's failings...if you're reading this, you can easily get that from the other reviews already here.  I do have a few specific issues though that I feel need to be mentioned.  While I'm sure that otherwise Maria Bello is a fine actress, she simply did NOT have the on-screen chemistry with Brendon Fraser that Rachel Weisz did as the character Evelyn O'Connell.  As ANY good movie buff can tell you, aside from writing and story plots, it's the chemistry between the actors as the characters that will make or break a movie.  The interaction between Fraser and Bello in this incarnation of ""The Mummy"" just seems forced at best and there really is no chemistry to speak of.  This in and of itself seriously diminishes Fraser's performance to little more than ""I really can't believe I needed the money this badly"".

The idea behind this plot and script held a great deal of promise.  Instead of rehashing the previous two movies (particularly after the period of time that has elapsed), this new idea...and new ""Mummy"" had some potential.  It's one of those concepts that probably seemed like a really good idea at the time but the execution was very poor and came off more as the movie makers just trying to cash in on a previously successful franchise without having to put a great deal of effort into it.  While the performance of the ""new"" characters in this movie are very good, the main characters of ""Rick O'Connell"", his companions and their exploits for which this series is based are simply very poor and not strong enough to carry the movie at all.

Again I won't go into the details of the plot but I have to honestly say that this movie wasn't worth the $1 I payed to rent it and it's certainly NOT worth the cost of purchase.  If you enjoyed the first two movies in this series, don't spoil it by getting this one...the magic is gone and it's simply not worth it.",1243987200,,2560,4.607929515418502

A dragon, yetis, an immortal sorcerer, his nemisis from ages ago, and her daughter work well to make an enjoyable bit of fluff.

It would have been better with Rachel Weisz as the leading lady though.  Maria Bello was competent, but lacked Weisz' vibrant style.  Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh brought in superior martial arts performances as well as playing their roles with style, which offset this lack a bit.

However, the film is too long by about 10-15 minutes and there is simply too much action and too much noise. The film needs more lulls.

*Spoilers*

I love The Mummy series, but this addition is simply terrible - a lazy retread of of its predecessors in hopes of wringing a few more dollars out of this franchise.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor seems one of those Hollywood movies devoted to making marriage look as pleasant as a root canal. Rick and Evie have stopped being passionate soul-mates who carefully balance their exploratory endeavors with less dangerous, but no less interesting pursuits (as in the second Mummy movie) and have, instead, been turned into the stereotypical empty-nest drudgery marriage. Evie no longer manages museums and attracts the praise of the historical community - she writes historical romances where she (disturbingly) has re-envisioned the most horrifying moments of her life as sexually exciting events. Really, my gorge rose when Evie tried to make the scene where she had been tied down next to a writhing, rotting mummy with a dagger poised over her heart as an erotic game to entice her tired husband to bed. Evie doesn't need an adventure - she needs counseling.

(Or perhaps it is the director who needs the counseling - the odd sexual connotations keep coming over and over through the course of this movie. Alex (a grown man now) confesses to his mother that he is not a virgin and she brightens in relief and asks chirpily ""How many?"" partners he has had, and seems positively panting for details. And Alex and his dad, Rick, spend far too much time arguing that ""size matters"" when it comes to...guns.)

Once the marital bickering is over and the action starts, we are treated to a lame, lazy retread of the first two movies. The motivations of the mummy are boring and trite without the depth of the previous movies (I preferred the motivation of 'true love' to a plain, straightforward ""Megalomaniac Seeks Immortality"" reading).

Oh, yes, and there's also a vomit scene. Do you know what made the other Mummy movies genuinely good flicks instead of soulless retreads? A lack of vomit, among other things. Thanks, Hollywood.

This movie provides captions for the hearing impaired.

2954539,2,B00004D2X8,"The first two Mummy flicks were both obvious labors of love by Stephen Sommers, their writer/director. They were amazing showcases for CGI effects, but beyond that they had engaging stories full of pulp action, lots of comedy that did not descend into camp, and wonderful characters performed by perfectly cast actors. Brendan Fraser, as American soldier-of-fortune Rick O'Connell, was a perfect pulp hero, brash and cocky and capable. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn ""Evy"" O'Connell (n Carnahan) was the brilliant and (extraordinarily) sexy librarian who could hold her own in a scrap. Together they had incredible chemistry, crack comic timing, and the charm and natural repartee of a classic  Hollywood couple (like Gable and Lombard, or Powell and Loy).

Throw in John Hannah as Evy's sleazy but lovable brother, Arnold Vosloo as great villain Imhotep (whose ultimate fate, at the end of the second film, possesses pathos and tragedy), and a host of great supporting roles, and you have some flicks with great characters on the screen at all times. Even the kid who plays the O'Connell's son, Alex, in the second film is brash and bratty without being annoying, a rare thing in a character like his.

The O'Connell's adventures continued in a short-lived cartoon that was fairly good, and I remember it fondly as one of the few sources of pulp goodness I could share with my then five-year-old son.

He and I watched The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor last night. When I say it's incredible, well, you'd darn well better believe that I am lying. Flat out full of it. On a George W. Bush scale. Because it's terrible.

Here's what's good about it:

  * The idea to do a third Mummy film.

  * The idea to use China as the setting, to do something different with the mummy idea this time around.

  * The idea to cast Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (always a great idea to cast either, an exceptional idea to have `em both).

  * Some cool creatures, like a really nicely done dragon, but especially the yeti. Because the yeti are the one point of absolute true awesome in the whole flick.

  * The final battle is okay.

You may notice that three of the things that are good about the movie start with ""The idea to..."" But those things ended without bringing the ideas to enjoyable fruition. The way it turned out, it was actually a bad idea to do a third Mummy film, the idea to use China was fine but the resulting story wasn't that interesting (though a good script doctor could have done great things with it), and they got Li and Yeoh in the film, and gave them both very little to do that was at all interesting.

This movie isn't a labor of love for Stephen Sommers, who this time just produced. It possesses none of the warmth or wit or charm of the previous films. The action is dull. The characters are uninteresting, and the main characters are written inconsistently with their earlier portrayals.

This is a bad movie. But beyond that, it's a bad movie with a worst thing about it. No, it's a bad movie with a Worst Thing About It. And that worst thing is Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz (who read the script and smartly refused to do it) as Evy.

This Worst Thing About It is two sided. First, it's bad because we lose Weisz, who was always magnetic and funny and smart and strong and just smoking hot as this character, and who had wondrous chemistry with Brendan Fraser.

Second, it's bad because we wind up with Bello, who is a very talented actress, but plays Evy with all the spunk and sexiness of a wad of mashed potatoes, and who has absolutely no chemistry with Fraser.

I can't overstate how badly this miscasting damages the film. The relationship between Rick and Evy is the heart of these movies, and had Weisz returned, this film would be at least twice as watchable just because of the dynamic between her and Fraser. Bello's performance is a sinkhole that draws the attention and drains away even what little vim there is in this movie. Even my son, who normally wouldn't be caught dead saying he cared about which actress plays a girl character, started kvetching almost immediately, and early in the film started cheering on the villains whenever they had Evy in deadly peril. He genuinely liked Rachel Weisz, and her replacement by Bello was so awful it was like a personal offense to him (and to me, and likely to a vast majority of fans of the previous films).

This film pretty much murders the franchise. This Mummy stays dead, and it should never have been born.",1236729600,,4497,4.602756892230577

Sure the movie has lots of action but little substance and no soul. Fast pacing spliced together with forced romance and poor comedy barely hold this movie together.

It could have been done well and sent the series out with a bang but with Hollywood focusing on the ""under 13 crowd"", this movie puts the lid on the coffin with no interest in raising the series from the dead.",1236729600,,530,4.520833333333333

2954542,3,B00004D2X8,"I loved the first two mummys so I had no problem picking up the latest installment.  To me the movie was a huge let down.  There were huge plot gaps such as why the witch left her daughter to be the guarder of the tomb, while the witch had the much cosier shan ra la duty?  How did the yeti come into play?  The relationship between mother / father and son seemed so strained that to call it acting was a stretch.  This movie came across as a rush job and the end result was bad dialogue, bad acting and even worse a weak storyline.

2954544,1,B00004D2X8,"Movie franchises, unlike most other human creations, often get worse with each subsequent incarnation.  This is quite aptly illustrated with Brendan Fraser's Mummy franchise.  The first Mummy came out in the spring of 1999, and was a commercial hit and probably the 2nd best movie of that year after the Matrix.  The 2nd Mummy came out several years later, and though interesting, had some ludicrious scenes in it.  This most recent Mummy just sucked.  If there was ever a perfect example of a movie in which the dialogue was used solely to join adjacent action scenes together, and provide an occasional slinger, this is it.  Unfortunately, even the action scenes were lackluster.

Worst of all, this movie lacked attention to detail in numerous scenes.  I will expand on this last point.  At the beginning of the movie, a narrator describes how the Dragon Emperor was turned to stone, and we see him frozen into a stance of pain and agony standing on the ground.  Outside his palace, his army is frozen into stone while in battle formation.  About 15 minutes later in the movie, this army is discovered in AD 1946, in a totally different formation, and the stone emperor is standing on a chariot holding the reins!  How do stone warriors change their stance?  Another screwed up scene was the episode in the Himalayas.  By the constant blizzard, I would guess the temperature of this setting is around 0 degrees F.  Several dozen characters are shown in this scene; many of them participating in dialogue, yet we cannot see any condensation from their breaths!  And probably the worst scene of all is the final fight scene between Fraser's character, Rick, and Jet Li's chracter, the Dragon Emperor.  Here we have numerous punches to the face on both sides, yet they each have perfect hair throughout the whole scene!  Absolutely ridiculous!

Even after leaving out these detail flaws, the acting is also horrible.  The romance scenes were totally contrived and rushed.  The mother - daughter scenes seemed fake, and Jet Li's portrayal as the Dragon Emperor was totally off.  His character seemed more like a general, or a magician, than that of an emperor.  There was no hint of nobility, regality, or supremacy in his role; only violence.  Probably the worst portrayal was that of Alex O'Connell.  This guy is supposed to be British, raised in the snobbish upper-crust of British aristocracy.  He seemed more like Indiana Jones.  And this leads to the biggest flaw of the movie; it seemed like a watered-down version of an Indiana Jones movie.  Overall, don't buy the DVD, and watch the movie only if you are really bored.",1235692800,,2626,4.853603603603603

So, I know that Jet Li's movements are authentic and realistic, even though we do not see enough Jet Li in this movie. I also enjoy movies by Jack Lee, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme but, I like Jet Li movies best. In fact, I like Jet Li so much that I would give a movie in which he stars an automatic 5 star. For patrons who are not familiar with Wu Shu (Chinese Kung Fu), I would suggest you buy and watch ""Dragons of the Orient"". Aside from Jet Li, this is a fantastic movie in terms of action sequences, story line and choice of sceneries. In my judgement, all the actors and actresses performed their roles very well. But, I must admit that I am enchanted by the mother. She displays such beautiful British mannerisms that I cannot help but to fall in love with her. I do not want to spoil the story for the patrons, but, in a nutshell, a dragon emperor and his army were cursed by a witch never to be lifted again lest they will enslave the world. But, the archaeologists mistakenly brought the Shang Ri La's eye to China  and awakened the dragon emperor. Then came a race against time to stop the emperor before he could reach the magic pool and raise his army, and then to bring them across a boundary to make them invisible. Incidentally, Michelle Yeoh looks great as the witch. All action movie aficionados will be endowed with a great pleasure by this movie.",1234483200,,1479,4.263345195729538

There are disconnects between this movie and the previous movie. The son was British, but now very American. It could happen, I suppose, but not likely. Fraser is ok in the movie. He seems like he could do this movie in his sleep. The obnoxious brother-in-law is more annoying in this one than the first two. The romance still works between Fraser and his wife. Bello as the wife is ok. The movie takes place in China and I thought that worked. Shangri-la was cool.

In summary, the movie barely works if you keep your expectations low. Yeoh is good and so is the daughter. The CGI and the special effects are good. Rent don't buy this movie.",1234224000,,803,4.248366013071895

I'm a big fan of Brendan Fraiser, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. LOVED the first two mummy movie.

Now I'm an even bigger fan of Rachael Weisz for not acting in this disaster.

The script was laughable (as in ""Ouch! Did they really just say that?!?""), the plot was watered down from the second installment and tended to take ridiculous leaps. The entire story insulted the legendary history of China. (I thought ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" was better than this pile of garbage.

There was none of the humor and wit from the first two movies.

2954557,1,B00004D2X8,"Mummy 3 should have been called Soapdish 2 rather than be included in the Mummy series.  We're actually to believe that Luke Ford, who is pushing 30, is the son of Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello who are in their early 40's at most.  You can literally see Fraser cringe when he has his ""father to son"" talks in the flick.  And let's be honest you kind of get the feeling this was a vehicle for Luke Ford rather than Fraser, Bello and Li.  Bello btw, is just horrible.  I like her better in movies with her top off rather than see her feign a piss poor English accent.  Rachel Weiz (sp?) really did make hold her own in the previous entries.

Other ef ups/Jumping The Shark, Yeti's come out of nowhere to save the day, Jet Li turns into King Ghidorah, John Hannah bombs and machine guns the Nationalists from a CGI air freighter.  Hannah, who I liked immensely in the other Mummy's is used strictly to show that this is indeed another Mummy sequel.  A total waste of good talent.

Jet Li's character?  What does he care that he wakes up thousands of years later?  Neon lighting, automobiles, airplanes, guns, Doublemint gum?  He doesn't have time to marvel at modern times he has a terra cotta army to awake and take over China.  Thank heaven he's defeated be a general he had killed.  I was kind of sad at seeing that, I would have liked to see how Li's character would have done against the Long Marchers.  Maybe the US would have funded his terra cotta army to defeat Mao first and Kim Il-sung later....but I'm getting ahead of myself.

The new Evie tried but could not bring that character to life like Rachel did. The chemistry was not there between Brendan and her either. Not her fault really, she did try. I do blame the producers and the director for screwing up this proven formula, but Rachel no matter how bad at least the set would have been complete...damn! That was my BIGGEST disappointment...NO RACHEL ""Im a librarian"" Totally hit the mark with her portrayal. Perfect chemistry between Brendan and her big brother. Incidently the big brother part was perfect as it was in the first 2 films....kudos to this gifted actor.
The producers and director really missed the point. DON'T change the recipe half way thru. Screwed up my DVD Mummy set for good.

They are considering a 4th installment to the Franchise. I hope they get it right this time. Gemma Arterton should play Evie' if Rachel doesn't do it.

Yet, you have to wade through a 'daddy issues' subplot, whiny and sometimes atrocious dialogue, and questions like, 'How exactly did the son lose his heavy British accent in the course of 10-20 years, in order to sound almost American?'

In the 1st Mummy of this series, there was a great blend of horror/action/adventure. The 2nd lightened up the tone, replacing most of the horror with a great sense of humor; of course, it was a retread of the first, but it was probably best of the series because it was the most entertaining. The 3rd on the other hand does bring the action, but that's about it, as it leaves you shaking your head more often then not.

the original actress that played Evie left because of script problems and i can see why. i actually had to pause the movie to see why she wasn't in it. after hearing why she left made the movie a lot more bearable.
anyways the script was bad; Jet Li has barley any lines, there is no connection between Rick and Evie, the lines sucked, and where is alex's accent? and how did everyone wind up in china? i thought everything was based around egypt and such. it just so happens that Johnathan owns a bar right down the street from the museum that the emporer was awoke from. and where is the past connection to the last mummy movies?
 it is downright horrible. from the first 2 mummy movies, you would never have guessed rick and evie having relationship troubles. and yet the script includes it, i don't see how they could have problems. and what was the deal with the ending? evie's brother says he is going to peru and then the screen starts to fade and it says ""soon after mummies are found in peru"" WTF? that was unexpected and that ruined the movie for me. that ending could have been better (a lot better) then what it was. i am going to hate to see the next 3 mummy movies. hopefully someone gets fired or does some actual work (or maybe they put Rachel back as the mother) because the producers ruined the mummy franchise by this movie.",1233273600,,1489,4.356115107913669

The move from Egypt to China is something I don't think the movie could overcome, but it was different and it was nice to see another country's legends and mythology on screen.

The points where it was lacking, and there are a few, is that the chemistry in the movie is completely lacking like in the first two. The replacement wife and Fraser just don't seem to click. Try as they might it just never seems to happen. This time around Fraser and the guy who plays Jonathan just seem like they just met and are still feeling each other out. This movie doesn't have the same zing to it as the others either. I felt Jet Li was actually under used. It's like they just wanted him for his martial arts and that's it.

2954581,5,B00004D2X8,"In The Mummy, Steven Sommers has given us a modern classic film. The quality (in all areas: acting casting, cinematography, directing, music, special effects) is impeccable, and the storyline unique.
  This film tells the story of a librarian named Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (played by John Hannah), who come across a map that leads to Hamunaptra, a burial city said to contain enormous treasure, the Book of the Dead, and the Book of Amun-Ra. They enlist the help of a rag-tag American named Rick O'Connell (played by Brendan Fraser), who claims to have been to the city before.
  Along the way, they find that they are not the only ones after the City of the Dead, and two separate groups reach the City simultaneously. During their stay at Hamunaptra, some smart, ""unsuperstitious"" person decides to read a spell from the recently unearthed Book of the Dead, which in turn awakes a mummy cursed to be undead for eternity. This mummy, named Imhotep, wishes to reawake the woman he loved millennia ago, and then conquer the world. It is up to those who awoke him to put him back in his grave. Sounds like fun!
  I believe this to be a landmark film. The special effects are very realistic, with barely a trace of CGI ""gooiness"". Jerry Goldsmith's (so sad that he has passed away now) score is haunting, beautiful, and unforgettable. And Stephen Sommers proves himself to be the director for good, exciting fun in movies!

P.S. ----Please, if you value your health, your sanity, and your life, never, EVER, watch The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Stay away from it like it was the plague! Fear it like the mummy's curse! Unless you like to see a perfectly good franchise destroyed with rotten dialogue, ludicrous storylines, and irritatingly crummy special effects, you will avoid that film at all costs.

Then they pasted in lines of cheesy dialog between the scenes of CGI effects. The main characters that you pay to see are in minor roles.  The story is chopped together with no flow.

After the first half hour of being inundated with mindless violence and special effects, I realized there wasn't going to be a plot. It was not going to morph from a bad martial arts film to a real Mummy movie and no one was going to end up in Egypt with the REAL mummy, that cute bald guy with the killer eyes.

I ended up fast forwarding to the end to see if there was any merit here. There wasn't. The actress who played Evie was absolutely horrible - without that sense of continuity and chemistry between Brendan Frasier and the adorable and much-missed Rachel Weisz (if she really did turn it down because of the script I love her even more) there was nothing to hook you - and I wasn't buying that new guy as their son either.

2954597,3,B00004D2X8,"I just finished viewing this one and while it does have its moments, its definitely not as good as the first two Mummy films or even its spin-off The Scorpion King!

The premise of this one is Alex O'Connell, now a grown man, discovers the tomb of the legendary Dragon Emperor. As he is about to unveil his find to the public, his parents show up for an unexpected visit while bringing back an artifact to the Chinese government. The artifact, unknown to the O'Connells, is actually the key to freeing The Dragon Emperor from his curse! Many attempted twists and turns on this one.

To be honest, the back story about Jet-Li's character is the probably the BEST part of the whole film! After that, the plot gets iffy! As I said earlier, it has its moments but overall it comes out very weak. While Jet Li is usually very good, I never felt like he was a real threat in this one. As for the actress that filled in for Rachel Weize as Evelyn O'Connell, I kind of felt sorry for her because she was stepping into a role that was made so good by Rachel. On its own merit, her performance wasn't that bad, its just too bad she had Rachel to be compared to. Everyone else was just okay.

Can't fault the man for that.  Yum.  Anyway!

It is my own opinion that ""The Mummy:  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" isn't a bad movie, but it suffers largely from the fact that the film's pace is so rushed.  There is so much going on in the story that 112 minutes is not nearly enough time to tell all of it properly.

The movie takes us from Singapore (where we barely take notice of Jonathan as the owner of a lush casino named after Imhotep) to the Himalayas to Shangri-La (very easy travel for our ragtag band of heroes) with one chase or gunfight scene after another, with such little attention paid towards the relationships between the O'Connells (maybe there would've been better chemistry between Bello and Fraser had there been more mushy Rick-and-Evie moments) or Alex with his parents or his uncle Jonathan.

I enjoyed the characters played by Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, though their screen time was shockingly limited and their interactions together was over much too quickly.  It seems like much more could've been done to flesh out their characters, and what could've been a great fight scene between them was cut too short.  The immortality of Yeoh and her daughter was given up almost immediately following Yeoh's appearance at Shangri-La, and did nobody notice that Yeoh's lover, and father of her daughter, was the leader of the soldiers that rose from below the Great Wall to battle the Emperor's vast army?  It was very obvious that was who he was, yet there was no interaction between him and his daughter, or him with Yeoh...and with all the build-up of their great love in the beginning, you'd think there would be something.

There was simply so much that was either glossed over or ignored completely, and it brought the movie down.  The actors did the best they could with the script, but despite their efforts this does not measure up to the first two Mummy movies.  It is worth checking out and deciding for yourself, but I would only buy this to complete your Mummy collection.",1231718400,,2947,5.403930131004367

The Yetti looked totally CG and the signal they made of ""field goal"" made my laugh and shake my head at the same time.  I wish they had written a more compelling and historically accurate story than this one as it was ALL action and had plot holes big enough for a tank to drive through.

The second, as previously indicated, was a disappointment.  However, everyone has more than redeemed themselves with this superb suspense thriller.

At the time this movie came out, I don't recall hearing that much about it.  I think it was released about the same time as the last (please God) Indiana Jones which was all anyone seemed to be able to talk about (it, in my opinion, was a dud--but I digress).

The fact that this third in the Mummy series takes place in China did not bother me as it appears to have some.  The action is, literally, non stop and the movie did a terrific job in its recreation of time and place (1940s).  Brandon Fraser is a great action hero and never fails to charm.  The actress who plays his wife was every bit as good as Rachel Weitz.  Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh round out this superb cast.

First... Rachel Weisz does not play the wife/mother. Bad bad bad move... keep the family intact or make up a reason why she's not appearing at all. The scenes with the new female were way out of line from what you would expect from the first two movies. She was more hesitant, mystic in the first two. She didn't attempt lame comedic lines in the first two.
Second... when you mix cultures that are far enough apart, it takes fine tuning. That didn't happen. And I hope it doesn't happen in any subsequent takes on the new mummy theme. It just didn't work.
Third.... the new Mummy. Just didn't work.
Fourth... the 'comedy relief' lines.... really really didn't work.
In summary... don't waste your time. Stick to the first two, they were congruent and flowed nicely together. This one stuck out poorly.

The first notably mistake was the absence of Rachel Weisz. (Evelyn) If you can't get the whole original cast back for a movie, why bother? These things hardly ever pay off and the chemistry between Brenden Frasier & Maria Bello simply is not there.

The plot is that it takes place some time after the last Mummy movie and Evelyn had written 2 successful Mummy books based on there previous 2 adventures and is struggling to find any inspiration for a 3rd book. In her personal life her and husband Richard (Frasier) have settled down and are bored out of there mind when an opportunity to take an amulet to China comes along, where they figure they will deliver it and go see there son who has just uncovered an emperors tomb with his army that was put there after being cursed by a witch. So yadda yadda yadda, the Emperor is freed and they try to stop him from reaching a pool of eternal life to raise his army.

It sounds a bit better then it was, as it seemed all the focus was put into the FX of the movie and little in character development, story line or plot. I'm sure anyone watching this in China would wonder why the hell they cast Jet Li in a non martial arts role and why the heck he is fighting abdominal snowmen?

In the first 2 mummy movies, there was an excitement of action that they could have ended the movie a long time before they did, but it kept going on getting more exciting and a bigger finale then the last... however this one lacks that completely. The end of the movie just seemed to come, happen and it was over with no big climax to it.

And even tho the last 2 movies may have had you suspend disbelief, this one seemed like they would just try anything, no matter how outlandish just to get the movie over and done with.

Even Brendan Fraisor shows signs of no interest in being in this movie, as he performers one of his most lamest performances to date with cheap little stale jokes thrown in between with bad timing, or drowned out by the musical score trying to somewhat add live to a flat-lining movie.",1231286400,,2241,4.298578199052133

The only relationship that seemed genuine was the one between Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong, which, I'll admit, was convincing and tender.  Jet Li was woefully underused as he gave as intense a performance as his limited role would allow.  Most importantly, however, removing the Mummy franchise from Egypt also removed all of the charm of its predecessors.  The first two films were fun, charming, and a joy to watch.

2954612,2,B00004D2X8,"For those of you who have read my reviews (for which I am grateful, by the way), you will undoubtedly have noticed the trend for these that has emerged over the time since I began writing them.  Initially, they consisted of two or more paragraphs which gave a general description of the film/s plot, followed by some commentary of the film's production aspects such as acting, writing, directing, etc.  Over time, the reviews grew longer and had more baroque lead-in & transitional paragraphs, accompanied by elements of editorial commentary.

For this review, I will try to keep the commentary (relatively) brief and won't incorporate lengthy editorializing:

THE MUMMY (1999) was a very creative and interesting film with a fantastic trailer, a great script, and very good dialogue.  It was a suspenseful action film that was able to ably integrate elements of horror and humor.  The acting was very effective all-around.  This highly effective combination made for not only an enjoyable film and impressive cinematic achievement, but is one of the few that could claim the overused and often undeserved title of ""New Classic"".

The first sequel (2001) was less clever and at least a little annoying.  The funniest (unintentionally) part of the film was the central notion to the theme of the wife suddenly becoming aware of ""oh that's right, I just remembered that I am a reincarnation of the evil queen's main rival and can take her on in a highly stylized and well-choreographed fight scene"".  It was literally almost that blatant.  In addition to the substitution of excessive CG effects in place of a well-written story, the film also had the clichd stereotype of the whiney/frightened Black sidekick.

Its second sequel (2008's THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR) had a poor script, bad acting (from good actors, which means lousy directing) and was just a lame and somewhat tedious & tired film altogether.  The lead actress was replaced (Maria Bello for Rachel Weisz), which was the closest thing to good acting (seeing Maria Bello do a passable British character).  Otherwise, it was wholly implausible that the two main characters were parents to an adult son.  All dialogue between the son (Luke Ford) and the cute Asian good quasi-ninjette (Isabella Leong) consisted of loud and campy declarative affectations that came straight out of a bad Neil Simon play (is there any other kind?) or a 1930's film.  Brendan Frazier's dialogue was reduced to stock theater gruntings as if lifted from a 1940's or 50's film.  John Hannah was reduced to saying loud bewailments every time he spoke.  The addition of Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li was ostensibly for some impressive chop-socky action scenes, even though both are average and subpar actors respectively.  In fact, there was only a brief wire-fu sequence which was a long way from impressive.  The story was banal and insipid.  In spite of some impressive visuals, the film just wasn't all that good.

The first film required a significant suspension of disbelief, but was a competently written & filmed story.  What all three have in common is the idiotic notion that an evil guy will be banished in death with a terrible curse which is somehow escapable, and allows that he will have super powers once he comes back to life.  How about in place of a super-curse, you just kill the guy and make sure he stays dead or powerless.  I suppose that is just navely wishful thinking...

By the way, the last line of the film suggests there's a fair to decent chance there will be another sequel.  Yikes.",1231200000,,3557,4.914572864321608

2954614,2,B00004D2X8,"...the ball was dropped on this film. Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.

Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....

The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.

Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.

Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.

In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.

Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.

Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.

And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics. At first, the Yetis were fluff, but then you start to like them. They are the `untarnished good' surrounded by evil.

The special effects are admirable. The battle scenes at the end are exceptional. The warriors (and Han) turning to sand and clay are so cool, myself and my friends all gave it a big `WHOA!'.

Rent it, just to see it. Own it, ONLY if you need to complete the series.

There was no chemistry between Rick and Evelyn.  None.

The attempts at humor were so unfunny that it was painful.  ""The yakk yacked"".  The action was predictable and poorly executed.  The abominable snowmen were bad beyond belief.

I would not put this title with the classics,but as a cure for insomnia,it's near the top of my list. There is virtually non-stop action,but rather mechanical and uninspired; like watching cars being built(or destroyed)on an assembly line with never an iota of human emotion.
Brendan Fraser's character and his movie-wife (a wasted Maria Bello)are now rich and bored and their son is in his early twenties. That's how you figure out Brendan and his new(old) wife are about twenty years older! When you consider how much was spent on sets,costumes,effects,etc; it's curious the lead man wasn't aged a day. The relationship between Brendan and his wife was superficial,and the father-son dynamic didn't exist.
There are lame archeology jokes to remind you this movie is aping Indiana Jones,Yetis thrown in for those with adhd,and the icing on this steaming pile of fluff is the ending ripped right from the Lord of the Rings.

2954624,4,B00004D2X8,"If I were to judge this movie according to the standards of serious movies it would get a non-rating, but it isn't meant to be a serious movie.  This is just a big budget light entertainment that has more to do with Hollywood serials from the early days of the movie industry than anything resembling an approach to art, originality, or meaning.  It is just supposed to be silly fun.  Do you like mummies?  If so, then you get to see it all again here, but on the other side of the world.  Like the old serials, the plot follows the same general trend and climaxes in a huge battle where good wins and evil is given the defeat it deserves.

Brendan Fraser is still Rick O'Connell, but Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weisz.  While I thought Bello played Evelyn O'Connell just fine, the rest of my family disliked the change intensely.  They probably should not have made the change.  While Jet Li's character has a big role in the movie, he has a small part, because most of the time Emperor Han is a computer generated monster.  But Jet Li's name was supposed to sell tickets.  While the movie cost $175 million to make, it only brought in $102 million in the U.S. market, but did $290 million overseas.  So, maybe it worked well for the producers when seen from a global perspective.  $392 million total box office (before DVD sales and other licensing rights) is pretty solid even with the disappointing domestic take.  I thought the plot point of having the son all grown up and a bit troubled was a nice addition and Luke Ford does a good job as Alex.

Whether or not you should see this movie is entirely based on how well you tolerate light sweets with no nutritional value.  Sometimes you feel like a candy bar instead of a salad.  I enjoyed it for what it aimed to be, but won't make any effort at all to remember it or think about what the movie ""was about"".  Really, it is just a bit of fun.

2954625,4,B00004D2X8,"After 7-years The Mummy franchise returns, but with a few changes; Stephen Sommers who wrote and directed the first 2 returns only as producer and half the cast is gone, but the character of Evelyn returns only played by Maria Bello rather than Rachel Weisz. Anyone that knows me pretty much knows that in general I'm not one for big Hollywood movies for the most part. Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been putting out some lousy flicks. Prior to that I Hollywood movies were fairly good overall, but I have to admit I really enjoyed The Mummy franchise. The first two were not great movies, but were highly entertaining.

But going into The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor my expectations were quite low. With new writers and a new director plus half the cast being gone I was hoping for something decent, but I didn't expect much, but Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was quite a surprise. While it's inferior to the previous two flicks in its own right it was enjoyable even with the flaws.

The script by Alfred Gough & Miles Miller was alright; it's never as amusing as the previous parts, but it does stay true to the franchise and mostly relies on the viewers knowing the characters. Overall the characters are just sort of there and they don't have the excellent character moments that had in the previous two, but like those movies the characters are still a lot of fun. The script could have used a touch up and it's pretty much your standard Hollywood action screenplay, but overall it serves its purpose.

I was never really much of a fan of director Rob Cohen, while he's done some decent movies personally I always find them slightly lacking and despite the flaws with The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'd say this is probably his best work thus far. While never as witty or creative as Stephen Sommers, Rob Cohen does get the job done on delivering a highly entertaining movie even with the flaws. The pacing was solid and there really are no slow moments and Cohen keeps the movie fun from the beginning to end.

I've liked Brendan Fraser ever since I saw Encino Man; what I like about him is he has this average everyday guy look rather than big Hollywood look and he's a lot better of an actor than he's given credit for. And once again Fraser is the man; I just love the character of Rick O'Connell and Fraser plays the part perfectly. This time around he doesn't have the great character moments like he did in the first two, but Fraser still makes the best out of it and delivers another solid performance and again is quite funny.

Maria Bello takes over the role of Evelyn O'Connell and does very well in the role. Personally I like Maria Bello more than Rachel Weisz, but I do think Rachel was a bit better as Evelyn, but Maria Bello is good enough and the movie doesn't suffer due to the re-casting of the role. John Hannah returns as Jonathan and this time around he seems to be here just for the sake of it. John Hannah stole the show in the first two and he almost does again, but he's just not given enough to do.

Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh are welcome additions to the cast even if not used to their full potential. You have Li and Yeoh in a movie and they aren't allowed to really showcase their skills, which was a shame. They do have a brief fight scene that while a bit disappointing fans of these two will still surly enjoy it just due to the fact it's Li Vs Yeoh. But both are underused for sure they never really get to showcase their skills, but both are still excellent.

The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is getting a lot of poor reviews and I'm not exactly sure why. While the first two movies were extremely fun I wouldn't say they were these epic classic films. They were simply fun and while yes this movie isn't as good it still serves its purpose as mindless entertainment just like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Again while inferior The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor still serves its purpose as a fun flick.

As fun as the movie was the franchise is running out of steam; the biggest flaw with the movie was really due to the fact there was nothing that could really be added to the concept, but I do think this series might still have a little bit of life left in it. Despite the mostly negative reviews I enjoyed The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, while inferior to the first two its still a fun ride that is far better than the reviews out there.

Film critic Roger Ebert hails THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR as the best of this series, and I guess that's why we have opinions. I happen to think that this third entry, while somewhat entertaining, is not as good as the first two films, not even close. This series, obviously more inspired by the Indiana Jones franchise than the Boris Karloff stuff, has never had the resonance or the pure rush of high adventure which made the first three Indy Jones flicks so memorable. And yet TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR has echoes of what I liked about the first two Mummy films. It's a silly movie, but it knows it's silly and invites you to embrace its campiness. Me, I liked the ride, up to a point.

Catching up with the O'Connells: It's 1946, and Rick and Evelyn O'Connell have fallen into a dreaded state, that of staid domesticity. Their adventuring days well behind them, Rick now whiles his time in incompetent fly-fishing, while Evie's writing career has stalled on writer's block. Oh, and their romance has gone in the way of ""meh..."" So how can't they help but perk up when the British Foreign Office offers them a mission of couriering a sacred relic back to the Chinese people. So off they go.

Seems to me that this particular mummy menace can be blamed on Rick and Evie's rebellious 20-year-old son Alex. Boy's followed his mother's scholarly ways and has become an archaeologist. And, even if he doesn't do the actual resurrecting, it's Alex who in China unearths the 2000-year-old Emperor and his army of terra-cotta warriors. Alex may not get on well with his dad, but, still, when an ancient evil warlord returns to life and dreams again of conquest, it's nice that one's parents have experience with stopping that sort of thing.

There may not be any pyramids in this one, but there are still tombs and sarcophagi. Perhaps to reinvigorate this series, the venue and mythology shift from Egypt to China, and, so, we get dragons and wushu, Shangri-La and yetis in the frozen Himalayas (who evidently are down with American football). The film also offers the possible (but kinda sketchy) origin of the Great Wall of China. But you know what? I miss the mummy Imhotep and I miss Oded Fehr as the grim, face-tattooed warrior who guards against the mummy's awakening. And I really miss Rachel Weisz. The quite unexpected choice to fill in as Evie is American actress Maria Bello and she actually does a fair job. But, no, it's not the same. On the other hand, Brendan Fraser is back as Rick O'Connell, and he's still got that affable, big lug charm. John Hannah is the other returnee, as Evie's greedy but likable brother Jonathan. Jonathan is now a thriving nightclub owner in Shanghai, which is very good news for the plot. He's still the predominant comic foil, which is one more dead horse these filmmakers don't mind beating.

Another thing to tsk tsk about is that the movie doesn't take full advantage of the martial arts talents of Eastern icons Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li. Jet Li is particularly wasted, as his character is mostly camouflaged in CG effects. I'll yell it to the world, brother: Jet Li, being already a human highlight, does NOT need CG effects! At least, in THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM, Jet Li has a fantastic one-off with Jackie Chan. And it would've been nice if Yeoh's character, the immortal sorceress Zi Yuan, had been allowed a reunion moment with her dead General, but the film was too eager to get to the two undead armies engaging in the fighty fight already. It's also a bit ironic that TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR came out the same summer as the fourth Indiana Jones, of that franchise this Mummy series has strived to emulate (but never quite surpassed). And like THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, there's an annoying youngster trying to upstage the old bull. Luke Ford plays Rick and Evie's son Alex with the appeal of someone clinically dead. This guy has zero chemistry with absolutely everyone and everything in this film. I guess it's a truimph of sorts that I don't find Alex as exasperating as Shia LeBeouf's Mutt (don't get me started on that vine swinging %$##).

This one simply lacks the scale, romance and panache (okay, campy panache) of the first two Mummy films. Coming out the same summer as IRON MAN, HELLBOY 2, DARK KNIGHT and, dammit, yes, even MAMMA MIA, TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR never really stood a chance. Factor in the stale storytelling, the lame dialogue, Rachel Weisz's absence, and the misuse of Jet Li and, well, you can see why Weisz chose not to dig up her role again. As for Brendan Fraser, he's a nice guy but I wouldn't be surprised if he's up for sequels to MONKEYBONE or BEDAZZLED.",1230076800,,4672,4.643288996372431

What happened to the charming BRITISH kid?  This guy is so Americanized that he makes the normal American voice seem cultured.  Give me a break!  He's a stiff, stilted actor as well.

It's the same old plot but watered down.  Big discovery, wake mummy up, he wants to rule the world, he raises an army, Rick saves the day, the end.  I can't believe the only cast originals are Rick and Jonathan.  I hoped to see a return of some of our Egyptian friends, that they would be needed to bring the latest bad guy down.  What a bummer!

This movie is so full of corny one-liners too.  One of the worst is when Jonathan is on fire and yelling at Rick: ""Spank my..."" well, you get the idea.  The point is, they were trying WAY too hard here!  I like some of the special effects, like the emperor turning to clay and getting fired all at once, and the bronze horses are neat too.  I also like the terra cotta warriors.

But I wanted to see more of Shangri-la, or to see the witch see her lover for one moment.  Hey, if he was pulled to pieces, why was his mummy pretty much intact?  And why, oh why, does Brenden Frasier still look so HOT when he should be in his 50's?  The timeline is really messed up as the first mummy movie was in the 20's and this is now the mid-40's.  He should have aged, as Evie and Jonathan should have.

The whole thing was rushed too, and it all came together too conveniently.  They really didn't face any setbacks, and any attempted drama was too easily solved.  I'd prefer to think the story left off at the 2nd movie, which was certainly pushing it.  The Rock as a giant man/scorpion and the diagram on the wall of his pyramid telling how to kill him was really pushing the envelope as it was.

There is a lot of martial arts in the film.  While I like martial arts movies as much as the next guy, it just didn't feel right in this film.  You'll be sitting there watching it and you will forget that your watching a movie about mummies.  On top of the martial arts feeling strange there is SO many things trying to be done at the same time that it starts to overwhelm you.  As soon as you start to understand something and get into it,  five more things happen that by the end will have made you forget all about the things you had started to understand.

Then the humor.  While a few things may have made me giggle, by no means did I bust out laughing.  All the laughter seemed like the same old stuff you've seen in the other mummy movies.  It seems to me that they tried to add to much humor in it.  I mean it is a movie about mummies trying to kill people and the world in danger of being over taken by a mad man who will kill anyone who wishes.  It's almost National Lampoonsish.  I know that seems strange but it is.  And maybe it's just me but Brendon Fraser always seems to be straining his voice, trying to make him self sound deeper than he is.  That may just be my ears letting me hear things that are not though.

In the end you get a movie that may have been good it is did not have a couple movies head of it.  Making people expect it to be a certain way.  But it does and we do.  As soon as you start watching it you will get the feeling that the makers had a lot more money than they have and they just wanted to make more.  It does not even have the same lady playing the wife.  I don't think the new lady (Maria Bello) who plays his wife, seems unable to act well in this role.  I have never seen her in anything I can remember so perhaps that is how she always acts.  But it seems strained to me.  If you really want to see this I would say rent it first.

2954645,2,B00004D2X8,"I'd have to agree with most of the other reviews on the quality of this movie.

I looked forward to seeing the third installment of ""The Mummy"" with anticipation, but was disappointed to the extent of taking a one day hiatus halfway through the film - it was that bad. The first two installments captivated me with a sense of adventure and were entertaining. This one just plain falls flat. While the introduction to the film was good enough, the rest lacked much of any kind of story which leaves the audience wondering what is happening and why.

First thing you'll notice is that Evie O'Connell is played by a different actress. The magic between Brendan Frazer and Rachel Weisz is missing to the point that (even though you know Maria Bello is supposed to be Evie) one asks, ""Who is this woman""?

Alex O'Connell is now a young adult and an adventurer in his own right. But where the second Mummy film showed us a tight knit family who would do anything for each other, Alex is now a rebel, Rick is a father who nags his son. Remember the lines from Mummy 2?

Rick: ""It isn't easy being a dad!""
Alex: ""No, but you do it real good.""

What happened to that relationship and support? This movie portrays a family who doesn't really seem to care a lot for each other and is in severe need of reconciliation. Really bad scripting. Drags the film into the ""B"" category for this tired old saw.

There is action here .... a LOT of action. But it doesn't hang together like the earlier releases. It just seems as if the writers looked for every reason to have lots of things going on to make up for a dramatic lack of story line.

Even Brendan Frazer seems tired with the role. His earlier spark as the pluck adventurer is gone and it seems as if he's saying mentally, ""here we go again. Kill the bad guy, save the world.""

The CGI and effects in the movie are nice and you won't be disappointed here. However, it takes more than just a bunch of special effects to make a good story.

Sorry guys; for as much as I liked the first two Mummy films and enjoyed Brendan Frazer in them, I have to give this movie a `thumbs down'. They should change the title to: ""Mummy 3: An Atrocious Continuance"". Two stars ... and I'm being generous. Recommended as a one time rental only.

2954647,3,B00004D2X8,"Several years have passed since ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) have made some decent box-office outings. The second sequel (arguably the unneeded sequel)to the action-fantasy franchise has a different director at the helm, in the name of Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious). If the first two films were any indication, Stephen Sommers is indeed a good action director; he knows how to make the wide camera angle, doesn't rely on slow motion and knows how to make his actors look quite cool. Rob Cohen also has a good resume, but you can tell that Sommers' absence was felt, but the film does have that Sommers` pace. (Sommers is present as producer)

Thousands of years ago, an evil emperor who has mastered the mystic arts had the malevolent intentions to take over the entire world. Betrayed by his general (Russell Wong), and cursed by the beauteous witch, Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh), the evil emperor was buried under the sands of time. Now awakened by an ambitious military leader (Anthony Wong), it is up to Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello), together with their all-grown up son Alex (Luke Ford) and the mysterious Lin (Hong Kong's own Isabella Leong) to try to stop the second rise of the evil emperor and his army. Here we go again....

The film's plot is very simple and feels like a rehash of the first two installments. The script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar is mainly built around the action and is full of familiar plot elements that it offers no surprises. While it's not exactly a lost cause, since there are some new additions to the screenplay that helped it out--(the Tibetan CGI kindly Abominable Snowmen, subtle doses of humor, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh) the film does lack a good dose of emotions. The father and son relationship offers nothing we haven't seen before, the bored ""retired"" adventurers gimmick, and the awakening of the two armies of the dead to oppose each other has been done numerous times.

The performances by the cast is good for the most part. Brendan Fraser is in familiar territory and Maria Bello (who takes over the sorely missed Rachel Weisz's role) does a convincing English woman. The two do have chemistry but they have so little to work with and they look too young and unconvincing to have a grown-up son. Speaking of chemistry, there are no sparks between Luke Ford and beauteous Isabella Leong, their time together onscreen falls flat. Leong is a capable actress (as proven in her Asian films) but her character is so severely underdeveloped along with Michelle Yeoh`s. Which is such a pity since Lin and Zi Yuan are the most interesting characters in the film. This would be difficult to do, since they may steal the spotlight from Rick and Evy, but the film would have stayed aloft if their characters took on more than supporting roles. Jet Li had limited screen time but he does still have that charisma that catches your eye, Li can act and fit's the role of the emperor. However, to hamper the actors further, the dialogue of the film is VERY clichd that it proved a little empty. I did say that there were subtle bits of humor that helped a little but I didn't say they were original.

Thankfully, the action sequences were entertaining to watch. The film has some nicely placed scenes of action, the shots are ""spiffy"" and the CGI effects, while not the best we've seen are quite good. Although the use of effects are somewhat clichd also. Water and ice effects, wind and fire, there's even a nice looking three headed dragon and the snowmen, armies of the dead--all good but not groundbreaking. The fights were good but not great, this is the part that you feel that it was fluid enough but it could have been better. I missed Stephen Sommers even though Rob Cohen did an acceptable job I think.

In closing, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is fun enough on the entertainment factor but it just feels a little flat. The action sequences were good but without the proper set up and emotions, the action felt like it was a simple excuse to delay the film's outcome. The film is so predictable that it throws its punches too soon and it overlooked several details that the story itself was also underdeveloped and full of holes. The film isn't as good or as entertaining as the first two films, but thankfully, it wasn't much, much worst.

2954648,4,B00004D2X8,"It's 1947 and the O'Connell's have retired.  Rick (Brendan Fraser) is trying to take up fly fishing.  And Evelyn (Maria Bello) has a case of writer's block trying to come up with a third book to follow her two best sellers based on their two adventures with mummies.  Truthfully, the two are bored out of their minds.  Which is why they are thrilled to be offered a chance to take a rare artifact to China.

The trip also gives them a chance to visit Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) who owns an Egyptian themed nightclub called ""Imhotep.""

Unbeknownst to them, it's also the current location of their grown son Alex (Luke Ford.)  Alex has just uncovered the ancient burial ground of Emperor Han (Jet Li) an ancient Chinese Emperor who, if awakened, will attempt to take over the world.

Naturally, the next thing anyone knows, the emperor is awake.  Can the O'Connell family figure out a way to stop their latest mummy?

This movie doesn't have the atmosphere the first one did.  There just isn't the sense of foreboding the permeates the entire thing.  And the story is predictable, especially if you've seen the first two.

But it is fun.  There are some great action sequences and impressive fights.  The special effects are top notch yet never feel like they get in the way of the story.  And there are several laughs.  The best were in the previews, but my favorite involved our first shot of Evelyn, played here by a different actress then the first two.

My only real problem was a rather significant plot hole.  At least I think there was one.  The story was moving so fast that either they forgot something major or explained it to us but I missed it.

No, this is not great cinema.  But it really isn't trying to be.  It's a fun way to kill a couple of hours, and if that is what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed.",1229644800,,1845,4.507552870090635
2954649,3,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy movies are tributes to Spielberg, who doesn't deserve any tributes.  The ""funny"" lines, the overblown soundtrack, the unbelievable plots - its all a bunch of rubbish.

But I watch Mummy movies to see the latest in special effects - not just the monsters - but the amazing locations and sets that are largely created digitally.  These movies are wonderful if you enjoy this as a means to its own end.  Some movies are star vehicles, the Mummy movies are special effects vehicles.  This one has some great stuff: Shangrai La, Abominable Snowmen and a terra cotta army of mummy's.  The film is also very well filmed and always looks very crisp and colorful.

On a casting note: Maria Bella is too classy to be Fraser's wife, and not sassy enough for the role.  Luke Ford is a disaster as Fraser's son.  He sounds like a hood from the Departed and is generally hard to like during the picture.  If they are thinking of this guy for his own movies, they need to back off the herb for a while.

2954651,4,B00004D2X8,"""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is a spectacular, all out action film that takes viewers into the heart of China to witness the battle between the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) and Rick O'Connell (Fraser.  Storywise, the film synopsis says it best.

Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick O'Connell in an epic adventure that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Along with his son Alex (Luke Ford), wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), he must stop a mummy awakened from a 2,000-year-old curse from enslaving the world.  Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress (Michelle Yeoh) to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) and his 10,000 warriors have lain forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. When dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, he turns to the only people he can think of with the skill and knowledge to combat the undead: his parents. But the Emperor's quest for world domination has only intensified during his imprisonment and, with unimaginable supernatural powers and a legion of Terra Cotta Warriors at his command, the Emperor Mummy could be an unstoppable force--unless the O'Connells can vanquish him first.

This film, just like the previous three, is pure escapism. While the first film drew on the Mummy (Bram Stoker), this entry is more original but more monumental in its' scope.  The special effects are good, and there is Fraser, charming as always yet he manages to escape and pull off the near impossible.

Don't watch it for history, watch it for fun.

If you manage to have the blu-ray version, the special features rock!

2954652,3,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is pretty self explanatory.  If you've seen any ""Mummy"" movie, you'll know that it takes a straightforward plot; you get a back story of how said mummy becomes that way, his rise from the dead, and then it's up to the O'Connell's to send that mummy back to where he came from.

There are some familiar faces in ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", Brendan Fraser reprises his role of Rick O'Connell and John Hannah returns as Jonathan.  Then you have Maria Bello replacing Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Luke Ford assuming the role of a much older Alex O'Connell.  This actor switch is where the minor irregularities come in.  Bello's replacement of Weisz is very noticeable and her British accent needs a lot of work.  And Ford's portrayal of the older Alex is sans the British accent he had in the second film.  Again, they are minor flaws, but flaws nonetheless.

Everything else was pretty much the same as any of the other two ""Mummy"" films.  You had car chases, airborne chases, plenty of shooting, tidbits of humor, lots and lots of mummies, and the same old ending.  ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" doesn't break new ground, but if you enjoyed any other film in the trilogy, you'll like this one.  It's not as good as the first, but much better than the second.  Crack open the sarcophagus and give the mummy one more shot at world domination, but let's just hope that in the end he'll stay in the tomb.  3.5 out of 5.",1229558400,,1452,4.4961832061068705

2954657,3,B00004D2X8,"Like many who saw it, I had high hopes for this movie, but low expectations. The fact is that franchises tend to get weaker over time (with few exception), and the Mummy is no different. The fact is that this film had so much freakin potential, and the filmmakers just let the opportunity fall through to a mediocre summer fun film.

The movie has a good number of breakdowns, one of which is the acting. Brendon Fraser brings a weakened performance to the table this time around. Whatever used to be there for him just wasn't there now. The new Mrs. O'Connel, Maria Bello, just wasn't doing it for me. I think she's a good actress, but I don't think she was right for the part. She made the character much more tame and motherly then Rachel Wiesz had portrayed her. Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh do an OK job, but they had only but so much to work with. Both characters seemed very hallow, especially Li's character as the Dragon Emperor. After he was sealed away, it seemed like there was no real reason for him to be alive. He himself even asks ""why did you raise me?"" The sad thing is that the Dragon Emperor had such potential to be an awesome villain, even worse them Imhotep. I mean the guy could control most of the elements, and he did it pretty well (though they could have got more creative with that as well). It just wasn't all that great.

The other let down was the action. Like i said, mediocre at best. It was an ok action flick, but i was so very disappointed in the battle at the end, especially with Yoeh and Li's very brief duel. It was so badly choreographed and ultimately pointless, a true waste of two martial artist actors. The only time when the action looked good is when CGI was involved; i.e. when the Emperor's army fights the dead soldiers from under the wall.

Bottom line, don't go into this thinking its another Mummy Returns. Imhotep is dead for good (they make sure to say so in the film) and the Dragon Emperor is here for the moment. A good movie for a rental, cuz it is a fun movie, I just wouldn't recommend buying it unless your into collecting for the trilogy.

Simply put, I enjoyed this,its a roller coaster movie.
Is it as good as the first 2 Mummy movies? No, when are sequels better than originals - not too often.
Is this any good ? Yes. Its a fun ride for 100 minutes. This time it's a Mummy from Shangri-La. There are some cool CGI SPFX -of monsters and Yeti and the action is more or less non stop. Jet Li becoming a 3 headed dragon and some other monster is very cool, the SPFX were great here. It is the same formula as the first 2 Mummy movies, witty dialog (some of the lines come up short) and just a lot of explosions and effects. The acting is perfectly fine for a movie like this. The love interest is non existent. It doesn't need to be the big story in this kind of movie. This is a movie that is meant to entertain you with action and effects, not to be a downer with a sad ending, not about love. The characters were all good enough for this kind of picture. And boy does this deliver, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It did what it set out to do entertain you with non stop action- 4 stars for a movie of this sort.

These movies remind me so much of Indiana Jones that I wish Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser would team up to fight a Mummy with a treasure thrown in. If you liked the first 2 Mummy movies and Indiana Jones movies then this most likely won't disappoint you,as long as you are expecting fast paced non stop action and a lot of effects.",1229385600,,1606,4.037617554858934
2954662,3,B00004D2X8,"There is no way this movie should receive over three stars. And the only reason I grant the extra star is because I understand and respect the amount of work it took to create the visual effects in the movie. The storyline was extremely poor. There was absolutely no chemistry between the married couple. Where in the world did Alex's accent go? He had an English accent as a little boy and now he sounds like he is from Brooklyn.

I am one of the biggest fans of the previous two movies. I even liked part two where people were ready to string the director up by his toenails for releasing such a thing. But this one?...oh my. Horrible! I really thought that Jet Li would ruin the flick but he was very good. It was the main actors that ruined it. They really needed to fire the replacement actress and beg Rachel to come back to play Eve.

But still after saying all that, I feel obligated to end the trilogy by purchasing this. I want to complete the set nothing more nothing less.",1229385600,,984,4.313513513513514
2954663,2,B00004D2X8,"Arguably a miserable film, but what a heck of a BD.

First off, this was tested on several players (Sony, Samsung, and PS3) and with the amount of menu navigation and options imposed upon screen pics - your player needs to be in perfect shape. The victor was the PS3 for seamless navigations and wait times.

The picture looked adequate almost to a fault on some of the special effects sequences. There are plenty of chances to test your white balance and motion blur with black/dark backdrops. The sound was enjoyable with the DTS, but you must have your system set up just right for a film like this as the highs can drown out some of the dialogue mix/music mash (so a solo HDTV will not sound as good obviously).

What makes this fun is the special features though. There are hours upon hours of extras to utilize, whether you watch them during the pic or by themselves. The two main docus are very informative on the production and are worth the watch. If anything, watch the Terra Cotta docu when Cohen gets a nice slam on Disney vs. real Chinese cultural history. The amount of ""I love working with (fill in the blank)"" gets sickening, especially with Fraser's high on something look in his interviews. The deleted scenes were thankfully removed from the film (11 minutes). The vast majority of the other features include trivia tracks, jumps to behind the scenes clips and various other trips throughout the Mummy trilogy via itemized chapter selections (like prior Universal titles).

Worth the purchase? Not really on a film level, but yes if you have the time to access all the extras.",1229385600,,1595,4.665480427046264

Rachel was not in it(that was a big let down), Alex was a bit too old, and CG effects could've been a little better. The good, Jet Li and the story plot. That's why my rating is only 3 stars. I liked it but then I didn't. I think for those that have not seen the Mummy movies, watch them first and then this one and judge for yourself.",1229385600,,435,3.9545454545454546
2954665,4,B00004D2X8,"Jet Li is one of the few redeeming things about this movie. I am being generous giving it three and a half stars mainly because of Li's acting and the new storyline in China. My wife and I felt this was a decent action but it needed Rachel Wiesz badly. The replacement of a main character is never easy and in this case I think they should have waited to make the movie until Wiesz was available. Her replacement, Maria Bello, did not show the special personality quirks, warmth, and depth that endeared us to Wiesz in the first two movies. The movie is a fair action sequel with lots of great scenes of fighting, but it feels strained and misses the fun of the first two. So if you want just action without the warmth of love exhibited in the first two you will probably not be disappointed. In this sequel the O'Connells, lead by their son Alex, fight a risen Chinese emperor. They endeavor to stop him from becoming immortal and raising his army. This feat requires enlisting the aid of a beautiful woman that has guarded the emperors tomb and a pool at Shagri La for centuries. She calls upon abominable snowmen and those killed by the emperor to assist them but the emperor controls all the elements and is a formidable opponent. Well worth at least a rental even with the absence of Wiesz. I bought it because I like the series, I just wish they had kept the same crew. If you enjoyed this catch ""Wanted"".

2954666,3,B00004D2X8,"Its very strange why this movie isn't alot better than the first two Mummy movies. Brendan Fraser and Jonathan Hyde from the first two movies are in The Mummy 3. They fly to China to help Brendan's now grown up son. The great Jet Li plays the villain, the mummy of an evil Chinese warlord. Even better, Michelle Yeoh is in this film as well, playing a Chinese princess who mixes it up with the mummy.

So why is this film not a five-star hit? I blame the director: Rob Cohen. Stephen Sommers directed the first two Mummy films, they were a fresh, fun re-works of the old Mummy movies. Those films had some punch to them, a ""big"" scope and the pacing was just right. This film has Yetis, explosions, mummies (two, count 'em, two mummy armies!), dragons, monsters and a big battle scene at the end but it is not put together very well. This film is alot like the director last few movies: Stealth, The Skulls, xXx. The Mummy 3 has the same video game elements as these films. Too much was thrown into this film: The Mummy has magic powers AND he can fight like Jet Li AND he can turn into a dragon AND he can turn into a giant Yeti AND....

I missed seeing this in a theatre, it was playing in movie houses for such a short time - that should tell you something.

The Mummy 3 is not a terrible film, I liked parts of it enough for 3 stars. I've seen worse. But don't expect to see something better than the first 2 Mummy pictures..",1229299200,,1429,4.208029197080292

Bello and Fraser are joined by their son, Alex (Luke Ford). Ford is miscast, too close in age to Fraser and their relationship is clich&eacute; (Indiana Jones, for example, used that particular plot device twice). Additionally, Alex and Lin (Isabella Leong) share little chemistry.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor marks an anniversary of sorts for Jet Li, who played the bad guy in the sloppy sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon-4/dp/0790738953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon 4</a>, ten years ago. Most moviegoers in 1998 hadn't yet witnessed Jet Li's martial art skills. Riggs and Murtaugh were tired and bloated but Jet Li almost single-handedly made Lethal Weapon 4 worth watching.

This time around, not even Jet Li can save the sequel.

There are as many reasons as plot holes why this sequel doesn't charm like the original, even allowing for the absent logic on which popcorn movies thrive. Haven't had enough exploding CGI mummies? Well, this is your movie. Besides, the international box office for Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ensures another sequel in a couple years (and don't be surprised if the O'Connell family shows up in South America).",1229299200,,3063,8.467492260061919
2954668,4,B00004D2X8,"First of all, let it be said that everything about this Blu-ray version of ""MUMMY: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""is technically superb -- the visual quality of the movie, the rich sound and the significant extras.

For home theater aficionados, watching this film on a full hi-def plasma or LCD, it actually looks better than it did in the theater.

But what about the movie itself?  The movie did OK at the box office ($100 M domestic and nearly $400M international), but there are many who have not seen it because the reviews (including many posted here) were weak.  So let's reconsider the movie itself.

Many of the theatrical reviewers missed the point of this whopping, exotic adventure and a portion of the potential audience stayed away from this ultimate popcorn flick.  Now the hi-def disc offers another chance to experience and yes, enjoy, this fine escapist entertainment that's also state-of-the-art filmmaking.

The Blu-ray version delivers an extraordinary-looking transfer of this exotic action adventure that lives up to the whopping premise of the title, which is: when a curse is broken, the 2,200 year old Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) is revived along with his horde of 10,000 warriors, no longer terra cotta tombmates!  And Rick O'Connell must stop them from enslaving the world.

This latest incarnation of the reborn mummy franchise is in every way an homage to the very best of the 1930s and 40s Saturday serials, and it is done on a huge scale that perfectly fits its story.  Yes it's over-the-top.  But that's the whole point.  It always respects the audience (unlike the ""Matrix""or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""sequels), and it is far superior to the dreadful ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" misadventure.

This is NOT a movie about plot so much as it is about the ride. And what a globe trotting ride it is.  How can you not love a movie that has fanaticized Chinese soldiers, an army of undead royal bodyguards, risen mummified bodies of unnumbered of oppressed (buried under the Great Wall) as well as fierce Yetis.  Yes, abominable snowmen.  And they are good guys!

Brendan Fraser is just right as Rick ""Mummy Hunter"" O'Connell who races from the catacombs of ancient China to a frigid redoubt in the high Himalayas.  Maria Bello is terrific as his Rick's wife Evelyn (Rachel Weisz opted to not return to the series).  Bello obviously loves this kind of rough and tumble action character,.  Michelle Yeoh is a cool charismatic screen presence as a double-crossing sorceress.

Rob Cohen is a genius with this material.  His visual commentary (you can watch the movie with him) is revealing and free-form.  He talks about the making of the movie of course as well as everything from President Elect Obama to his own practice of Buddhism.

If you're looking for serious, intimate epics in the vein of David Lean, forget it.  But if you want to feel like a 12 year old in the best way, don't miss this adventure that never lets up.  The scope and detail of the production design is superb.  And for the most part accurate for the period portrayed.

The extras are generous.  I loved the ""making of"" featurette and the Blu-ray option that enables the viewer to collect favorite scenes and share in the on-line community.

Give this extravagant and fun flick another chance.  Highly recommended for what it is.  A big, wild ride.",1229212800,,3356,4.833333333333333

2954670,5,B00004D2X8,"There are a few reviewers who have said that these movies are great escapism, they're not meant to be taken seriously nor are the characters. The characters seem to be mere extensions of the old action movie clichs of the past with Brendan Fraser being the tough talking action hero, and John Hannah being the wimpy slimeball who always survives thanks to the heroes. I have to be thruthful and say I've never watched the first two Mummy movies in their entirety, I have only caught them either at the middle or the end but I have loved every bit I've seen.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'm guessing is set a few years after the last Mummy movie due to their son Alex now being about 25. Alex is now an explorer and is in search of the tomb of Dragon Emperor Han. He finds it but finds he's being pursued by Chinese soldiers wanting to bring the frozen emperor back to life so that he can bring China back to greatness. Alex's parents the legendary Richard and Evelyn O'connell are employed by the British government to take the ancient Chinese relic The Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a sign of good will. Unfortunately not all goes to plan and the Eye is stolen and used to awaken the emperor by General Yang.

Over the course of the film after the emperors awakening follows a number of fast paced action scenes, very well choreographed fighting and some stellar special effects. The Mummy films have always been known for their epic size in particular scenes including the massive battles that usually take place near the end. This film is no exception to that rule and seeks to push the epic size further and further. The look of the Emperor before he takes back his human form is shockingly realistic, the CGI chase scene blended with the real life chasers is amazing and flawless. The acting I have to be honest is a bit ""meh"" but you don't watch such a movie expecting 5 star acting, yet I so want Brendan Fraser to come out with some excellent acting talent.

I would highly recommend this to all fans of the Mummy movies as it keeps true to the original style and feel of the past ones. The special effects are amazing and the movie is made all the more special by Fraser being his usual awesome self.",1229040000,,2214,4.421568627450981

The Director: Replacing Stephen Sommers with Rob Cohen was the biggest mistake. I can understand if Mr. Sommers refused to direct this movie once he finished reading the script.

The Casts: Rachel Weiz replaced with Maria Bello makes the Evelyn character dull: the joke, the magic conection between Rick and Evelyn as in the prevous 2 movies is lost, I don't know why Rachel refused this project, but I think she made a very smart decision.
Luke Ford, indeed is too old to played the son, he looks more like a brother to Brendan Fraser.

The Talents: A waste of talents, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh can do more than that, yet the director didn't maximize their talents.
Maria Bello tried so hard to play Evelyn character, but failed. I think she was a great actress, but after seeing her in this movie I changed my mind.

The Visual Effects: A westerner director made an oriental dragon = screwed up in every way, a chinesse dragon doesn't look like that! find an art director who did a research first before creating a movie.

The Script: (Warning: contain spoiler) The story is so stupid and awfull, that is insulted our mind and logic. The biggest joke is when a mummy who can change into an indestructible flying dragon had to change into a flightless beast, and then change back to a human, so that he can be killed by his enemy.

Their son, who is all grown up now to be picking up women at his Uncle Jonathan's nightclub in Shangai, gets into another adventure of his own when the entire fanmily inadvertently (is there any other way) awake the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) from his stony slumber and after that all hell pretty much breaks loose.
I'd leave it to your imagination as to what transpires. But rest assured, this is the weakest in the entire Mummy series and some disappointing performance by none other than Brendan Fraser (act like your 47, man!) and surprisingly Jet Li.
I would not say it was terrible, its still worth a rental at best, but don't have any high hopes on this one, infact have none at all!

a very generous 2.5 stars.",1226620800,,1096,4.50251256281407
2954691,3,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was a great action film. The biggest downside to the film was the acting; Which was some of the worst in the history of cinema. Brendan Fraser reprises his role as Alex O'Connell but his wife has been replaced with someone who cannot act and he has a son. The son looks about the same age as Alex, which is stupid and funny. I mean how old is Brendan Fraser now? 40? He still looks like he is in his late twentys. What's the secert Fraser? Anyways, as I said-awesome action film with great speical effects. The acting is like something you'd view on a straight to dvd or cable tv movie.

2954698,1,B00004D2X8,"to my personal taste, mummy 1 was marvelous and mummy 2 was awesome. not only because of their scripts and the stories, but also due to the colors added to the characters by the actors and actresses. beautiful, cute, naive, yet determined Rachel Weisz, humorous and funny but a hardcore adventurer Brendan Fraser and a bit gutless but good-hearted John Hannah. these people were the main taste of the two movies of the series. now, the personality of Rachel Weisz, thus the color that she added to the movie was removed and a totally new and opposite, colorless, cold and hollow character was embedded for the same role, leading the result to a missing leg of the trivet, and a sour taste in the mouth.

the script is another disaster:
- for no reason, Jonathan runs a night club in China, which has almost no effect on the progress of the events.

- the story is totally monotonous, boring, perfunctory, a bit copycat smelling and includes no creativity or lacks new ideas that previous series did (like the rocket-boosted balloon-ship in Mummy 1 or a reincarnated lover who tries to resurrect her partner in Mummy 2).

- i also, did not understand why the evil general, who has the intention of serving the emperor to seize the whole world, has an ""army"" of a size less than a squadron, formed by less trained, dumb looking soldiers, living in tents settled in the middle of nowhere, with only armament of two motorcycles, one 4x4 vehicle and one AA-gun (because only this much equipment is needed in the coming scenes).

- the scene that rick and alex has a conversation to show off their knowledge on weapons, as a father - son conflict thing, is a complete rubbish, timeless and unnecessary. how can anyone imagine two characters wasting their time for such a conversation while they have to form a line of defense against the approaching enemy?

- the idea of destroying the tower holding the seat of the diamond which will pinpoint the hidden gates with explosives is a complete nonsense, because they do not need to destroy the whole tower, but only the seat. they can achieve this goal easily by firing some rounds at the seat itself.

i am not even commenting on the cheap ideas of Chinese soldier's uniforms inspired by German uniforms of WWII, or Hitler looking face of the terracota, yet alive emperor, just before he restores his broken shape.

my conclusion: this movie does not worth the money, it is not a part of Mummy series but it is a total killer of the reputation of the series itself. i cannot imagine a Mummy 4 after this failure.",1225324800,,2555,4.626931567328918
2954699,3,B00004D2X8,"We saw this at a bargain theater for $2 a ticket. Its okay, but not fabulous. I think fans of the first Mummy film won't really enjoy this one as much. Maybe it just loses something when its not in Egypt. Some people might like it a lot. I had low expectations going in so I thought it was worth 3 stars (I was only counting on one or two). The effects are pretty good and the costumes are nice. The acting isn't Oscar material, but neither was the original. To be honest, if we buy this on DVD it will be after its been out a while and we can get a used copy fairly cheap. You might want to rent it before you commit to buying it at the ""new"" price.

You've got a good deal of action and adventure with some serious romance thrown in, too.

1. The PS3 had an update a few months ago which gave the machine the capability of ""remembering"" where the viewer left off (stopping the disc or even removing it). Upon restarting the disc, it would pick up at that point. This disc does not respond to that useful feature. You have to noodle your way through the film to find where you left off.
2. Sometimes I like to freeze the frame and enjoy a moment in the cinematography, or perhaps play a portion in slo-mo. This disc has a pop-up ""slider bar"" which shows you where you are in the time line of the film. This thing appears whenever you activate Pause, etc. The feature seems to be unavoidable and I find it quite annoying. This a case where, IMHO, the Blu-ray ""bells and whistles"" are out of control.",1217376000,,840,4.425806451612903

2954718,5,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" receives a very nice look Blu-ray transfer for this new edition of the movie. Capturing the adventurous elements of films like ""Indiana Jones"" and injecting it into the basic story for the 1932 film ""The Mummy"", Stephen Sommers creates a terrific, enteraining film. For those interested in a synposis of the plot, I'll provide it at the end of the review because you've probably already seen this.

The Blu-ray transfer looks quite good here with bold colors that more closely recall the original theatrical presentation than the DVD. The image is crisp and while there's evidently some digital noise reduction applied, Universal hasn't completely cleaned away all the film grain which is a good thing because when that's done you actually lose sharpness and clarity (it is restored with a loss of detail via Edge Enhancement like the recent reissue of ""Patton"" which went overboard with digitally cleaning up the film). The best thing that Universal could have done here was to leave the grain intact and dispense with the Edge Enhancement. I suspect that the same source was used for the Blu-ray as was used for the HD-DVD edition but that the Edge Enhancement is more transparent here because of higher resolution.

What does all of that mean? The film looks extremely good but could look brilliant. Still, on the whole this looks much better than the DVD edition.

The extras are still presented in 480p (which is standard DVD definition)so be aware those haven't been updated. However, Universal has made this a U-Control disc where you can customize the extras as you watch the film (something developed for and carried over from HD-DVD). You do get the ability to watch the visual commentary/extras while watching the film. All of the original extras from the DVD have been ported over for this edition. All of the extras and the film are on the single disc edition here (unlike the DVD which has most of the extras on a second disc).

Followed by the equally entertaining (and much bigger production of) ""The Mummy Returns"" and a fun entertaining (if lesser)spin-off film ""The Scorpion King"", ""The Mummy"" is worth picking up again even if you have the original DVD edition. Highly recommended.

Oh, and the plot? A group of explorers led by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)and Rick (Brendan Fraiser)rush to find the riches of an Egyptian tomb and end up reviving Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo)an Egyptian High Priest buried alive for his part in a conspiracy to kill the Pharoah. Brought back by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Im-Ho-Tep takes revenge on those who plundered his tomb and seeks the Book of the Dead to bring back his beloved princess who helped him kill the Pharoah.

2954721,5,B00004D2X8,"This was such a fun movie to watch. I can remember when I first heard Brendan Fraser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-of-the-Jungle/dp/6304711867/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George of the Jungle</a>) was starring in it I questioned whether I wanted to see it but I am SO glad I did. As good as it is on a small screen it was outstanding to watch on the large. Even though it's barely over two hours you almost left the theater exhausted.

Fraser plays fortune hunter Rick O'Connell, a man motivated by treasure but also very loyal to his friends & partners. Rachel Weisz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Constant-Gardener-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000C65Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Constant Gardener (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays Evie, a librarian whose specialty is ancient Egyptian artifacts. John Hannah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sliding-Doors/dp/6305210411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sliding Doors</a>) plays her brother Jonathan, a less than scrupulous want-to-be archeologist/fortune-hunter who, contrary to a review in the New Yorker Magazine, is not a ""dim but cowardly..."" character. To me, Hannah's portrayal of Jonathan is one of the surprising gems of the film. Always looking for the quick-fix but willing to stand up for his sister. But the one character that steals almost every scene he's in is Arnold Vosloo's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Diamond-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MZHW40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Diamond (Widescreen Edition)</a>) ""Imhotep"", otherwise known as the mummy.

The premise is Evie (with a little not-so-legal help from her brother) discovers the location of the lost treasure city of Hamunaptra. Upon arriving she reads from the ""book of the dead"", releasing the mummy, who plans to resurrect his lost love and then pretty much rain disaster over the whole world. And of course, he needs to sacrifice Evie to do it. It's up to O'Connell & Jonathan with help from a descendent of the ancient Pharaoh guards to rescue her and kill the Mummy before he can unleash his terror.

There are many things to like here. The actors play off each other wonderfully. The plot, while hokey at times is a blast to follow, especially because the filmmakers never take it too seriously. The special effects are outstanding, not only for 1999 standards, but holds up well even now. And the soundtrack is a perfect fit, never over-powering a scene. Overall, just a great film to escape into for two hours.

Unfortunately, the sequel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-Returns-HD-DVD/dp/B000KN7BIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy Returns [HD DVD</a>]) never lived up to this film. Although it used the same blueprint, the plot quickly slipped from unbelievable (OK for this type of film) to ludicrous (a death sentence). But with the new film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-Tomb-of-the-Dragon-Emperor-Blu-ray/dp/B0018C9H1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  [Blu-ray</a>]) being released this summer I am hopeful for a return to greatness, or at least a return to enjoyability. My only reservation is that Rachel Wiesz was unable to reprise her role as Evie. Let's hope her replacement, Maria Bello (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Trade-Center-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000JLTRKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)</a>), is as good.",1215302400,,3648,6.704016913319239

2954725,4,B00004D2X8,"When it comes to remakes of classic films, I usually just don't bother. However, the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"" is a remake in the loosest of terms. The only thing that the two stories really have in common are the central plot points of a priest of ancient Egypt who has been executed for commiting the blasphemy of attempting to raise the dead, the priest being brought back to life in the 1920's, and the priest (the mummy) then seeing a 20th century girl as the physical likeness of the Egyptian girl for which he was buried alive thousands of years before. Everything else has been changed to appeal to modern audiences and give license to the special effects team, including the fact that the hero in this story is a ne'er do well versus the English gentleman who is the protagonist in the 1932 film. Here the mummy pursues the girl with supernatural physical powers he has been given upon his resurrection. In the 1932 film the mummy and the modern girl have a psychic connection since it is implied she actually is the reincarnated princess that he loved thousands of years before.

Of course, this movie has Imhotep receiving all of these special powers upon his resurrection so many cool special effects can be demonstrated, but I was left wondering - If the threat of his resurrection is left hanging over the heads of the Pharoah's bodyguards and their descendents for all eternity, wouldn't it have been smarter just to kill him in the first place and bypass the living death to which they sentenced him?

Since so much of the plot has been changed, this movie actually does work as a combination adventure film and screwball comedy versus the horror film for which it was named. Nothing beats the original, though, in my humble opinion.",1209772800,,1751,4.663430420711974

The mummies are also capable of causing and leading sandstorms against their adversaries. The figures present in hieroglyphics can come alive and step out of them.  Dung beetles are presented as vicious, flesh-eating beetles that crawl under the skin of their victims, and attack in hordes. Magic incantations, when read out of a secret book, can change everything.

Three thousand years ago, an Egyptian priest touched a woman who belonged to the pharaoh. The priest was punished by getting embalmed alive, with flesh-eating beetles devouring his flesh. The pharaoh's wealth was hidden in the area, and it became the subject of centuries of speculation, storytelling, and efforts to locate it.

The protagonists of this story manage to find the hidden city (Hamunaptra), which has long been dismissed as fantasy. The stories about pharaoh's wealth are also true. But then they have to tangle with the mummy of the long-ago slain priest who takes their flesh in his efforts to become a fleshed-out human once again.

Sound:
The audio for this movie really helped the experience.  At certain points I felt as though I were truly in the film and as battles were sweeping across the screen the sword fighting with its clangs and clinks really hit home.  A nice surround sound setup will do this movie the justice it deserves.

Movie:
I'm not really sure how I managed to let this movie (and it's sequel) slip past me for the last few years, but I am glad I picked this one up.  The story-line was easy to follow but not simplistic, I didn't really feel as though there was much slow down as most of the film is action packed.

This priest is buried alive without his ""vital organs"" ( I didn't know you could still be alive without your ""vital organs"").  Roaches or some type of bugs are, also, buried with him.  Remember the bugs.  This priest is inadvertently awaken and goes around trying to collect the vital organs of his human contacts.  One by one the priest acquires these ""vital organs"".

This movie has the flavor of the Indiana Jones movies, music, characters, etc.  It could easily have been called ""Indiana Jones and the Lost Sarcophagus, but that would have landed the makers in court for a copyright infringement.

2954736,4,B00004D2X8,"1999's ""The Mummy"" is a well-done throw-back to an earlier age of movie-making with its monsters, heroes, and damsels in distress.  The 1932 horror classic featuring Boris Karloff gets a thrilling remake with a strong cast headed by Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Voslo, and John Hannah, much enhanced by the latest in computer-generated imagery.

The movie opens with the story of Imhotep (a nicely menacing Arnold Voslo), an Egyptian priest caught by the Pharoah violating one of his concubines.  Imhotep's murder of the Pharoah draws him the horrible living death of entombment in a coffin full of flesh-eating bugs, at Hamanatra, the City of the Dead.

The story flashes forward to a French Foreign Legion unit under attack by Arab raiders at the same location a few millenia later. The leader of the Legionaires, an American named Rick O'Connell (played with suitable swagger by Brendan Fraser) survives the massacre and escapes across the desert.

The story jumps now to a museum in Cairo, where Evie (played with equal parts brains and klutziness by Rachel Weisz), a female Egyptologist, is researching the mysteries of the now legendary Hamanatra.  Her never-do-well, cowardly, but likeable brother Jonathan (John Hannah) surfaces with an artifact that is the key to the mystery.  The two decide to find the City of the Dead.

Rachel hires Rick to guide them across the desert, after first rescuing him from the hangman's noose in a Cairo jail.  The three, accompanied by Rick's erstwhile jailer, travel by river steamer and camel, racing a competing team of archeologists and tracked by a mysterious group of avengers who seek to prevent them from reaching Hamanatra.  At Hamanatra, our heroes uncover the ""Book of the Dead"" and accidentally resurrect Imhotep.  The stage is set for a wild series of adventures, as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan are pursued back to Cairo by Imhotep, then must follow him back to Hamanatra to rescue Evie.

The movie manages to be a nice combination of thrilling action broken up by moments of comedy.  Much of the story is a tongue-in-cheek homage to earlier adventure classics.  If the dialogue is sometimes cliched, the action steps along quickly enough to avoid boring the viewer.  The sets are authentic looking, and the movie score nicely accents the action.

This movie is highly recommended as first rate entertainment.  This DVD version has some nice extra features on the special effects and Egyptology 101.",1194652800,,2459,5.062034739454094
2954737,5,B00004D2X8,"I love all things ""Egyptian"" and was definitely excited to watch this when it came out. It was so entertaining that I got the DVD. I love this movie. It's NOT supposed to be taken seriously, so all those that gave it a 1-3 star need to loosen up and wake up (literally they do, because some said they fell asleep watching this?!!) This movie is the essence of what you call ""escapism."" It helps you escape from life, plain & simple. It's full of action, comedy, duels, suspense, and adventure. The 2nd one in my opinion is better in some ways, like in terms of writing, and there is much more substance, but to me the original is always the best. The difference between the 1st and 2nd is this one is funnier, while the 2nd has better action & adventure. If you're feeling down & need laughs, bored and need excitement, or have a movie night with family and/or friends, this is the perfect movie for you. Yes, it can dip into being a bit corny, but that does not diminish it's humor, excitement, and adventure. I couldn't agree more with Amazon's review by Jenny Brown. She says, ""If outrageous effects, a hunky hero, and some hearty laughs are what you're looking for, the 1999 version of The Mummy is spectacularly good fun."" And ""When that action gets going, hold tight--those two hours just fly by."" And even though Anthony Lane of ""The New Yorker"" did not have much kind words for it, he was intelligent enough to notice how good Brendan Fraser is in it, "" What redeems it is the presence of Fraser...he successfully demonstrates how to be lusty and affable at the same time."" I love him in this. He is sexy, funny, and tremendously good at comedy. He has excellent comic timing. Rachel Weisz is also excellent in it. I think she played her bumbling, clumsy, but sexy librarian wonderfully. Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed-and definitely not bored!",1194566400,,1864,4.550595238095238

I got my HD DVD player last year and have been thoroughly stoked about it, given the right movie.  ""The Mummy"" is definitely one of those right movies.  From the opening credits to the first views of the Egyptian city, the clarity of the high-def presentation rivals that of your local theater.  Once a wall-sized monitor becomes available, film buffs are truly going to be able to have the theater experience right in their own homes.

But there were a bunch of little things and scenes that went unnoticed before that are front and center in this edition because of the improved sound and picture.

One thing I never noticed before is right after Imhotep's casket fell through the tomb ceiling there is a line through the center of the picture, it disappeared in less than a minute. I doubt this is fault to do with the HD transfer so it was probably on the original print.

Its blend of humour, adventure, action and nostalgia really did make it the INDIANA JONES IV movie that never was (but still may yet be - personally, I hope not. Best leave it at 3 good movies).

This disk is a good place to start for you if you are a bit new (as we are) to HD. It was, for years, a standard def test disk. The picture looks beautiful and sharp. The blue skies look crystal clear, the flames look hot, the gold looks warm and the reds don't bleed at all. Great DTS core sound too (its all we as yet - but we're working on it!) and a story that is a great old yarn that is creepy rather than scary.

There are some faults but they do lie fully on the limitation of film making technology at that period in time. On this disk, I do feel that the format does rather show up those limitations, it does make some blue/geen screen work seem even more obvious that it perhaps might be - a fault shared with THE MUMMY RETURNS, which we also have.

I wasn't expecting much from this, I was actually expecting it to be more of a horror story, but its basically an action-adventure.  Some might not like that, but I do.  It brought back memories of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, of course thats what it meant to do.  I loved the dialoge.  It was funny and a bit cheesy, but again thats how this was supposed to be.

Even the subplots were gems--although you see Captain Havlock (Bernard Fox) for three scenes, he is a lively supporting character with his own soul and story.

Fraser was able to pull off a credible Indiana Jones-type character, while still maintaining his own adolescent playfulness.  I am glad that the directors and the producers let Brendan be Brendan, and thus differentiating this film form the other 1930's era films:  The Phantom, the Shadow, and Sky Captain.

This film is a delightful mixture of seriousness and comedy, horror and humor, capped off by tongue in cheek playfulness--reminiscent of the Ghostbusters or Kolchack.

There are only two drawbacks to this film. The first is that they went a little too wild with some of the CGI, specifically the slack-jaw expression of the mummies.  It looks funny the first time, but is too hokey.  They keep their shape, but do show some yellowing with age.

The other issue is why they called this The Mummy.  The Boris Karloff classic is it's own thing, and bears a superficial resemblance to this film.  As a fan of black and white films, it certainly would have cleared up things if I could talk about the Golden Age of Horror film without confusing the uninitiated.  Then again, if you do not call the film The Mummy, what would you call it?",1162512000,,1456,4.752988047808765
2954761,4,B00004D2X8,"(3.5/5 stars) This movie brings to mind some action-adventure movies of old, such as ""Gunga Din"" or ""Bengal Brigade."" Despite the efforts of its keepers, a mummy is inadvertently awakened. It terrorizes a group of treasure seekers and archaeologists with its rather flamboyant magic. Will he be stopped before enslaving humanity? I prefer T.P. to CGI, but CGI's appeal is understandable, especially on such a large scale as this. There is also too much humor in this film. Sparse amounts, sprinkled intermittently, might suit the adventurous mindset of the movie, but it was carried too far here. Apparently the intent was to distance this from the 1932 horror film as far as possible. The likeable Brendan Fraser fits the action hero role well, and I have given this three star movie an extra  star since it also features the beautiful Rachel Weisz. This belongs in the same category as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" because both are enjoyable, but not great by any means.",1157414400,,970,4.950920245398773
2954762,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a throwback to two different schools of filmmaking: the globe-trotting republic serial adventure flicks (where Indiana Jones took inspiration from) and also the monster horror genre for which Universal Studios is famous for. The plot-line is pretty well-known; explorers and treasure hunters disturb a mummy's tomb, and he comes back to seek revenge. Only now instead of a man wrapped in bandages, we get sleek, sexy, bald Arnold Vosloo in robes and enhanced by computer graphics. And instead of the plastic, gung-ho hero we get the very likeable Brendan Fraser.

The Mummy is a pretty fun film from a relatively undistinguished director. If you dig the romanticized, Indiana Jones-style adventuring with laid back heroes and fiesty female leads (Rachel Weisz), this is a great movie to check out. The cast is having lots of fun, the script packs in lots of good comedy bits and action setpieces, and the CG effects are handled well. They went a little overboard with the sequel and packed in too much of everything there, but this first installment is a nicely contained film.

There are two editions, the regular collector's package and another 2-disc ultimate package. The ultimate set doesn't add that much except for commentaries and a look at the sequel (now useless), and also loses the isolated score bonus feature. This single disc can also be found in the Mummy 3-pack that collects all the movies together.

The jokes are miserably obvious and the director follows the truly annoying tactic of having the actors move in unison when grouped together. In addition to that, the plot besmirches one of the most revered figures in history - Imhotep, recorded history's first multi-disciplinary genius.

All that having been said, the subject matter is interesting enough that one can actually have some fun watching it. Rachel Weisz's spritely performance has a lot to do with that, though. Without her, this movie would be DOA.",1149552000,,584,5.020618556701031
2954764,4,B00004D2X8,"In the late 90's, Universal Studios decided it was time to dust off their famous monsters of old, and give them a face-lift in order to give thrills and chills to the new generation of moviegoers that never experienced them during their peak.  To accomplish this task, Universal tapped a relatively unknown director named Stephen Sommers to rejuvenate their famous monster the mummy.  So, with basically a rookie director, a lofty budget, and a decently big name star in Brendan Fraser, Universal put a lot of faith and clout behind their remake of ""The Mummy"".  But one problem still remains with this remake, can it possibly impress the older generation that grew up on the original, and can it muster enough thrills for the newer, more jaded generation?

""The Mummy"" is the story of a 3,000 year old force of terror being unleashed upon Egypt.  The mummy (Arnold Vosloo) is a former Egyptian priest named Imhotep, who betrayed the pharoah when he struck up an affair with the pharoah's wife, and as punishment both Imhotep and his love were placed in a cursed tomb where they would forever remain.  That is until a team of explorers lead by Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) accidentally release the monster upon Egypt.  As if the monster wasn't enough to deal with, Egypt is bombarded by plagues of Biblical proportion that seem to follow the mummy wherever he goes.  Can Rick and Evie save Egypt from the mummy's wrath, or will they become part of his unwitting legion of zombies?  Time will tell.

Though expectations for ""The Mummy"" were decent, there was still plenty of skepticism surrounding the possible success of the remake.  Earlier I posed the question that was present in many people's minds in regards to this film, could this remake even hope to equal the original film and impress both old and new generations of moviegoers?  The answer, a resounding yes for both.  Based on huge box office numbers and critical praise, it was clear that Universal's gamble to resurrect their monsters of old was not a mistake.  With the success of the film, actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz were propelled to super-stardom, and it wasn't long before the offers started rolling in.  The two lead actors weren't the only ones benefiting from the huge success of ""The Mummy"", director Stephen Sommers showed off his knack for special effects extravaganzas, and found himself in charge of a budding new franchise for Universal Studios, not a bad way to boost a career.  Alongside the live actors in the film, the special effects team at George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, were given the daunting task of creating a realistic-looking CGI mummy.  No small task by any means, but the creative team pulled it off stunningly, along with the CGI creation of the mummy, ILM handled all of the special effects work for the film, all with outstanding results by the way.  For a remake, an all to common theme in Hollywood these days, Universal sure chose wisely and managed to avoid the most common pitfall of remakes, the fact that most can't even come close to matching the original in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly ""The Mummy"" is the exception to what has long been the rule.

If you're looking for a good blockbuster movie with plenty of humor, thrills, and even a few chills, then do yourself a favor and watch this enjoyable film that rejuvenated the Hollywood monster movie genre and started a franchise in the process.

""The Mummy"" of 1999 is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) flick as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.

Everything magically works in ""The Mummy"" granting us a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe.

John Hannah grants some highly comedic moments as Rachael's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasle.

The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material.

Since this film, most people know him as the guy who is still trying desperately hard to make a good film. Now Brendan Fraser is a good actor (in small doses) thats why he was enjoyable in Encino Man (crummy movie, but not much talking for him). At times Brendan was amusing but a majority of the time his acting seemed like he was trying really hard to fit into his role and it wasn't letting him in.

Rachel Weisz is a beautiful woman with a great acting skill. I'll leave it at that no complaints.

Special Effects were at the time revolutionary. They did things previously unattempted. Of course Stephen didn't do these things, the eggheads at ILM did.

Stephen Sommers has done some wild b-movies in his time (Deep Rising) and was a great choice to write and direct this remake of the old 1930s Universal horror show. Though I must stress that very little of this film is original.

Basically it's an Indiana Jones rip-off with bits of Evil Dead and Hellraiser thrown in. Cliches are abundant and stereotyped, stock characters make up much of the supporting cast. Not only do we get a fair English maiden and a bumbling Brit designed to make the yank look cool but there are also gung-ho cowboys, stuffy professors, a cowardly weasel traitor (who really gets what he deserves) and a slimy slob prison warden. Argh! There's no real point in complaining about this as they're just supposed to be easy identifiable characters for younger audiences to appreciate.

There isn't really much scary about The Mummy, which is what the original was all about. Which brings me to the main problem of the film. Im-ho-tep (played by the wicked-cool Nicolas Cage doppelganger Arnold Vosloo) is not really a bad guy. Everything he does is for love. Hardly the worst villain in history. In fact the greedy folks excavating his tomb, jeopardizing the lives of everyone else for the sake of money are far worse, morally.

The action is exciting and some of the plot elements, however copycatted, are imaginative and clever. The 2 hour+ running time seems to fly by. It may be unoriginal but there's still more heart in The Mummy than in rubbish like Underworld.

Then, Anck Su Namun and Imhotep kill the pharoh. The rest you much watch it's all very interesting and exciting.

2954794,3,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is not a mere remake, because although it's slightly based in the 1932 movie, this version is completely different, the special effects in 1999 were sufficiently advanced to make a spectacular movie. And in my opinion, the remakes should be done this way, writing new stories, adding more things, but respecting the original idea. When Hollywood tries to make a remake step by step, it usually is a fatal mistake, just take a look to ""Psycho (1998)"", it's a lame version of Hitchcock's original version.

""The Mummy"" is one of the quintessential summer movies of recent years, it's fast paced, it has amazing special effects, it has humor, it has colorful characters, and it has a beautiful heroine Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz), a brave girl that combines charm, exotic beauty and courage. The hero John Hannah (played by Brendan Fraser) is a combination of Indiana Jones and George Of The Jungle.

Fraser doesn't have the typical physical aspect of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Eastwood or Ford, but he does a good job in ""The Mummy"", and it's a welcome change to the typical movie hero. The movie has a lot of interesting visual effects, specially when Imhotep uses the sand to create a giant version of his face.

""The Mummy"" loses some steam when it becomes too repetitive in some scenes, but overall this is entertainment, and it's noticeable that the director, the cast and the crew of ""The Mummy"" made a modern version of an old movie with good results. A very amusing movie.",1092009600,,1494,4.828125
2954795,5,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a WONDERFUL movie, set during the interwar period in Egypt, dealing with the adventures of an unlikely group that has banded together for a variety of reasons in exploring the lost City of the Dead-Hamunaptra.
The acting is very good, the costumes are extraordinary, and the plot is GREAT! The Mummy successfully combines adventure, horror, humour and romance, but what really steals the show is the ""villains"" who had me rooting for them throughout the whole movie.
There is a very strong element of archaeology and mythology; what with the lost City of the Dead, the Gold Book of Life and the Black book of death, the gods Anubis and Horus etc.
Deserts, Pyramids, Heroes, and Villains are all about...
Strongly recommended to those who are fascinated with archaeology and history, especially those with a keen interest in Ancient Egypt.  It is a definite ""must see"" together with the sequel The Mummy Returns, as well as the Scorpion King and Stargate, which also fall into the same category of movies, theme-wise.",1087516800,,1029,4.913793103448276
2954796,4,B00004D2X8,The Mummy is full of action and adventure as well as good acting.  Usually I find when films are shot in the desert the plot gets old and boring (ex. Hidalgo) but not this film.  This has a little Indiana Jones and a little bit of Alien mixed in.  It is a really good popcorn movie.  One thing I have to say is that I think they could've got a better actor for the lead role instead of Brenden Frazier.  The british girl played a good role.  The special effects were awesome and the story really grabs you.  See this or rent it.  I highly reccomend it.,1084060800,,552,4.093457943925234
2954797,4,B00004D2X8,"1999's The Mummy is the equivalent of a B movie produced on an epic scale.  It's only real aim is to entertain, and it certainly does that.  The campy nature of the dialogue works because the filmmakers have no shame: what, you say we've already used up our quota of clich&eacute;s and really cheesy jokes?  Well, find more of them.  And get me some stereotypical Egyptians - we're not making this movie without some stereotypical Egyptian comic relief.  If you're going to go, go for broke, I always say.  The special effects also make things interesting.  Some of them are quite good, but every so often you will see something that just looks rather silly - but that's okay.  Hey, they already dropped a ton of money on special effects; you can't expect everything to be perfect.  Those of us fascinated by ancient Egypt pretty much will ourselves to be drawn into the story: after all, this thing starts out as a mission to find the legendary city of Hamunaptra, aka the City of the Dead, complete with nifty little codices, hieroglyphics, and ancient books.  Then of course you have the mummy; this guy is not content to just sneak around and say Boo in an effort to frighten everyone he meets; no, good old Imhotep has the plagues of Egypt as his calling card, and he possesses supernatural powers that make him all but invulnerable.
I know this story raises questions in the mind of the viewer.  Take, for example, the whole curse thing inflicted upon Imhotep.  I have to admit he had it coming; messing around with the Pharaoh's mistress, even when she is as attractive as Anck Su Namun, is a bad idea; murdering the pharaoh himself probably crosses the line into the land of major boo-boo.  What do you do to a high priest who has committed such sins?  Chop off his tongue - okay, I'm with you on that one; wrap him in mummy bandages and throw him in a sarcophagus - right, that will work; throw a bucket full of scarabs on him that will consume his flesh, then bury him alive - that does sound like a good plan.  But there's a catch; if he ever happens to be reanimated, he'll have super-powers.  That is when you have to start questioning ancient Egyptian judgment.  I would have just chopped the guy into pieces and made sure he could not have made it to an afterlife.
Well, adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and the sister-brother team of Evelyn the librarian of ancient Egyptian history and Jonathon the alcoholic find and open Imhotep's sarcophagus.  Evelyn then proceeds to read aloud from the Book of the Dead she just ""borrowed"" from a trio of American treasure hunters and brings Imhotep back to life.  Much chasing, fighting, killing, and general mayhem ensue.  All poor Imhotep wants to do is to reanimate the corpse of his beloved Anck Su Namun; most men can't even remember their wife's birthday, but this guy, after 3000 years, still thinks only of his special lady.  Doesn't that just make you feel warm all over?
Don't expect to learn anything about Egypt in this film; The Mummy plays fast and loose with internal logic, so it certainly isn't out to recreate ancient Egypt in a realistic fashion.  Just sit back, laugh when you're supposed to, and let The Mummy entertain you.  Personally, I'm fascinated with actress Rachel Weisz.  She just has a rare, hypnotic radiance to her that grows and grows as the movie progresses.",1083715200,,3359,4.635135135135135
2954798,5,B00004D2X8,"Before there was ''The Scorpion King'', or ''The Mummy Returns'', there was the Mummy.
The Mummy by Universal Pictures, is probably the best remake of an original horror film I have seen. It's not just a remake, but it's a completely new story that is scary, entertaining, fun and suspenseful. Now this great movie has been released on a DVD and it comes with a couple of nice features and presents this film in great form.
The movie stars Brendan Frasier as a French soldier fighting in the Middle East who is captured and about to be executed by enemy forces.
Rachel Weis plays Evelyn Carnahan, an archelogist who accidently saves Frasier from
execution. Evelyn loves studying and learning about Mummy Tombs, pharoas and Egyptian people. Eventually Evelyn learns of a special book called the Book of The Dead, which is all about mummies, resurrection andthe afterlife.
Evelyn and a group of other explorers,start digging into the tomb and treasures
of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), an evil and vicious king who is killed with his
mistress in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead.
Basically this guy and his mistress committed violent crimes and eventually got the
same punishment they inflicted on their victims. Evelyn and the other nieve explorers, eventually resurrect the dead king which leads to a chain reaction of violence, death, and imminent death to anyone who comes
into his path.
The King/Mummy isn't at full strength, and so uses his magical and deadly powers, starts absorbing his victims, until he gets full power. Once he gets full power, the Mummy not only plans to resurrect his evil mistress but plans to conquer everthing in it's path.
Richard Occonel (Frasier) and the others must not only find a way to stay alive but find a way to kill the mummy before his power becomes to great
and powerful to be stop.

Visual Effects
--------------
Before the movie, horror films had used a couple of visual effects mixed in with
horror. ''A NightMare On Elm Street'' for example but ''The Mummy'' raises the bar for visual effects in a horror film to an all time high.
When you are not getting scared to death by the suspense and horror of the film,
you are dazzled by the amazing special effects which an all new area to the film.
For instance, the visual effects that show The Mummy metamorphorsing to it's
true form is not only scary, but fantastic!!!
Also the many scenes in the film, like the quicksand scene, and the many scenes
where the dead warriors of the mummy come to life are absolute chilling, because
they brought to life by the special effects.

The Mummy's Success
------------------
The Mummy released in 1999, was a great box office smash which had horror fans going to the movie in great numbers. The film's success lay in combing a good story, along with great effects, and graphic , suspenseful scenes that leave on the edge of you're seat.
Eventually, the creators of the Mummy would smell it's success and create a sequel
called ''The Mummy Returns''.
The Mummy Returns is a great sequel in which the Mummy is again being revived, along with a strong warrior known as ''The Scorpion King'' All these sequels, couldn't have done been done without this one. The Mummy by Steven Soderbergh is a great horror film full of great suspense and visual effects. The DVD is very well done and is highly recommended.

2954802,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy was a surprise box-office smash in 1999, it grossed over $400 million worldwide.  Writer/director Stephen Sommers soon became noticied, his previous film Deep Rising wasn't much of a hit, he also followed up with a sequel, The Mummy Returns in the summer of 2001.
  The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, John Hannah, Oded Fehr and the very funny Kevin J. O'Conner.  Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a young soldier who is soon arrested and held in a prison, Weisz plays Evelyn, a librarian who is in search of an adventure, Hannah plays her funny brother, Johnathan.  Weisz agrees to pay the prison handler a substantial payment in order to release Fraser, and Fraser is agreeing to lead Weisz into Humanptra, the city of the Dead.  The film's prologue starts off with a little lesson about Imhoptep, the Pharoah's high priest, and it explains why he was killed.  Soon the film's suspense builds up when Weisz finds the Book of the Dead, and unfortunately reads from it and wakes up Imhotep.  The adventure, suspense and intensity begins and Fraser along with his friends must stop Imhotep from becoming invincible.
  The film does stay reasonably close to the story of the original 1932 Boris Karloff classic, The Mummy.  Though critics didn't really relish it, it did succeed at the box-office and was a huge hit of 1999.  The real highlights of the movie would have to be the action sequences, that's what the film really is about: ACTION and lots of it.  The visual and special effects were also superb, specifically the sequence with sandface and plane.  This film was also suprisingly humorous, Kevin J. O'Conner plays Benny, Rick's friend along with John Hannah, Weisz's brother in the film.  I actually though Fraser was able to pull of the lead role, I never really pictured him as a hero especially of an action flick, one who saves the day so to speak
but he does it well, he's charming, cunning and handsome.  Weisz who was a bit of an unknown then, quickly gained her fame and soon appeared in a lot of other movies.  Also Oded Fehr who plays a Medjai warrior comes in of some assistance, he's perfect for his role for he's handsome, strong and cunning.  And as for writer/director Stephen Sommers, he quickly was on the rode to stardom, he has a new film in progress called Van Helsing which looks pretty neat, comes out May 7th, 2004, and interestingly enough The Mummy came out on May 7th, 1999 so just about the same time.
  The Mummy is rated PG-13 for Pervasive Adventure Violence and Some Partial Nudity.  The violence is just about non-stop, despite the film's gory premise, the movie isn't really over-the-top or horribly gruesoming.  The violence includes lots of bloodless gunplay, fistfights, swordplay and other mayhem.  There is partial nudity, which is fairly revealing.  Not really any profanity, though this film might not be too good for young children because they're are a few frightening images, such as the scareb beetles, the mummies which are monster-like, etc.
All in all this film is fairly silly, but still is works well on its own.  It's cool, action-packed and funny, a great film and not a bad pick to own on Video or DVD, preferrably the special edition.",1077321600,,3235,4.7855855855855856

A curse is put over him that he might rise again, bringing with him the plauges of Egypt, his sole purpose to resurrect his love.  Centuries later, an explorer and a librarian team up to find the city in which he was buried, but find much more than that.  The film is amazing!  For children, I would say a maybe.  The violence is fairly intense, and I'm not a big fan of some of the magic, but all-in-all I enjoyed this flick.  This will be a classic for ages to come!!!",1068076800,,807,4.391891891891892
2954807,5,B00004D2X8,"There is a wonderful, unpretentious vibe to The Mummy that makes it a true crowd pleaser. Unlike most Indiana Jones-style imitators, it isn't really trying to rip off that movie but instead take a page out of its book and pay homage to the old '30s serials of which the Indy films also drew their inspiration from. And it does it successfully.
Brendan Fraser finally catapulted to proper leading man status with this film and he is great. In the best Harrison Ford tradition, Fraser has a roguish charm, but when it comes down to it, is a true hero. The chemistry between him and Rachel Weisz is excellent and feels genuine. She is no mere damsel in distress and holds her own with the big boys and isn't too hard on the eyes either. The supporting cast is also top notch -- although, Kevin O'Connor does get on my nerves a bit, but that was kinda the point of his character, I suppose.
Stephen Sommers does a solid job directing this movie. After Deep Rising, who woulda thought? He creates the perfect mood and atmosphere of a period film but with a contemporary twist, of sorts, and also includes exciting action set pieces that action/adventure fans expect. There is just the right blend of humour, thrills and action.
Fans of the film should get this particular DVD set because it includes a wealth of extra material... the highlights being the 3 audio commentaries: one by Sommers and his editor that is informative, one by Fraser, which has the occasional lulls, but is not bad, and finally, the best of the bunch, the cast commentary with Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo which is lots of fun to listen to -- definitive the most enjoyable of the three.
There is also an awesome, speaker-shaking DTS track on the first disc and a near flawless transfer. There are tons of goodies on the second DVD -- mostly background info Egyptian mythology and technical featurettes on how they did effects, etc. which is fine if you're into that kinda thing.
Bottom line: this is as good as action/adventure films get without the Indy Jones label on it. Sommers and co. went on to make The Mummy Returns, which I found anti-climatic and too overloaded with action sequences and missing the magic that the first one had (also they added an annoying kid!). Except no substitutes and get this movie!",1065052800,,2304,4.635696821515892
2954808,5,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is maximum adventure, a rollercoaster ride of non-stop action, cliffhanger thrills, and crowdpleasing humor. Writer/director Stephen Sommers' homage of Saturday Matinee serials and past horror films is every bit as fun as the Indiana Jones movies, and even surpasses them when it comes to frenetic pacing. Not since The Last Crusade have I seen an adventure movie so enjoyable and immensely likeable.
To keep the film from ever getting boring, Sommers wisely delivers a wide variety of action sequences. There are massive gun battles (the opening is spectacular), chases (on foot, car, and even airplane), and swordfights. So much of it is so thrilling, it's hard to decide which action scene is the best (perhaps the opening gun battle or the sandstorm or the climactic sword battle against the mummies). The special effects are outstanding and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy Imhotep makes for a genuinely imposing villain.
Most importantly, though, the characters are likeable and a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser makes for a dashing action hero, Rachel Weisz is an appealing heroine, and John Hanna is hilarious as Weisz's inept brother. With characters worth caring for, the movie even builds up palpable suspense and excitement, all the way to the very end. Too bad the sequel wasn't nearly as fun.",1064620800,,1305,5.102803738317757

2954811,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy was a film I wasn't quite sure about when I saw it on commercials.  But when it came out on video, I decided to rent it and check it out.  I admit, I actually liked it, more so than I thought.  It is by no means a flawless film, but it's quite entertaining and it's a movie, and a movie is supposed to be entertaining.
Brendan Fraser is sort of a carbon copy of Indiana Jones in a lot of ways, but he is original enough that he forms his own character quite well.  Even though this is really the only film I've seen him and brushing by his other film titles, it may be the last as well.  Fraser brings a heroic, but funny persona to the movie, which makes it very enjoyable.  His one liners and how he says them are very funny and you can't help but cheer him on when he wrestles with dead guys.
The only problem I have with Fraser's character, and I wouldn't really call it a problem I guess, but a critique, is that his character is a little too invincible.  Again, this adds to the entertainment, but some parts I think are too unrealistic, almost cartoon like.  Example: slashes off the head of a mummy with his sword and uses that head on the end of the sword to bash another mummy.  Funny, but cartoon like, least it was to me.
As for the story line, it was pretty good, bringing Mummies back to the silver screen.  People have an appetite or craving for Egyptian culture.  Why Hollywood doesn't make more films surrounding Mummies or Egypt is a quandry to me.  This film educates you a little bit about Egyptian methods of mummification, but the history of it is kinda awful.  The storyline does have plenty of suspense in it, which is what makes this film work.  I thought the regeneration of the mummy was quite good and the different plagues that followed the curse.  You'll see.  If you've seen past mummy movies then you'll probably follow along nicely.
Something I did not like was the mummy trying to make out with Rachel Weisz's character.  I thought that was quite gross and stupid.  A dead thing wanting to kiss a mortal?  Not real.  Rachel Weisz's character is quite cute I might add, but that's not relevant.
Um, a problem I had with this movie was the animation.  I say animation instead of special effects, because that's how it comes across.  The Mummy starts off as a skeleton and you can tell that it's a computer pixel.  It's not even close to being real.  And some of the background shots are also too animated.  I mean, the special effects weren't all that great in certain parts, it made this film too unreal and too computerized.
Overall, I give this film four stars.  I give it four stars because it is a good, entertaining film that you can watch more than once.  This film isn't for the serious, I might add, it is for the easy movie goer who is looking for a fun time.  But the animation kinda keeps this from being a five star movie because it keeps it from being scarey as well as real.  Which if this film had, it would be a classic.

2954813,5,B00004D2X8,"I'm not exactly sure one can put enough emphasis on how great and entertaining a movie ""The Mummy"" is.  Reflecting upon the many great action/adventure movies of the nineties brings me to the conclusion that this silver screen phenomenon must be listed among the top five to ten films of the nineties.  Of course this is evidenced by its overwhelming box office receipts and DVD sales.  The odd thing for me was that due to a heavy work schedule and limited time, I never even saw a trailer for this great movie and thus didn't afford myself the opportunity to see it in the theaters!  This oversight was of course corrected with its sequel, ""The Mummy Returns.""
The stars - Given Brendan Frasier's past films I never would've ever expected him to make such an outstanding action/adventure star as he is with his performance in this film.  It almost seems as if the role of swashbuckling adventurer Rick O'Connell was created for him and him alone.  Then there's the ever beautiful and gorgeous Rachel Weisz starring as ""Evy"" or Evelyn whose performance in this film is dead on perfect as the librarian/adventurer.  Arnold Vosloo performs perfectly in the role of the Mummy.
One might think that a film of this nature might fall short on plot while being heavy on the action; this is simply not the case with ""The Mummy.""  The film moves along fluidly with a great amount of attention centered on the plot and supported perfectly by the comedic moments and the seamless CGI provided by ILM, the masters of the CGI domain.
I don't normally comment on the director but in this case I feel almost compelled to state that director and author of the screenplay, Stephen Sommers ""must"" be commended for bringing this outstanding story to fruition for it is simply a brilliant piece of work.  In ""The Mummy"" he has most certainly created the latest and greatest big budget, heavy action film series that can easily be compared to the Indiana Jones films, using those as a benchmark.
The premise:
The film opens with a superb opening sequence some three thousand years ago as we're taken to ancient Egypt in the year 1290 B.C. and shown the circumstances of how the High Priest Imhotep ended up being the Mummy through his and Anck Su Namun's treachery against Pharaoh Seti.  After his treachery, he attempts to resurrect Anck Su Namun in Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the Pharaoh's guards catch him and he is mummified.
Scrolling forward to the year 1926 and we meet our erstwhile heroes who through their chance meeting are on an adventure to find Hamunaptra.  While the majority of the group is searching for hidden treasure, Evy is looking for more...  Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, she finds more and what follows is as stated above, one of the best action/adventure movies of the nineties and probably the best of this type since the last Indiana Jones film.
I highly recommend this film for all its merits; it is a great film that is fun and extraordinarily enjoyable.  {ssintrepid}

Evie, a libraian, discovers a map and key to the boks of the dead in the City of The Dead.  her and her brother hire Rick to take them there.
Once there, they accidently let out a mummy that has been dead for a long time and he has the power to take over the world.  Since they let him out, it's up to them to trap him again.
This mvoie has great special effects and is really funny too.  Rick and Ardeth Bay are great characters who make the great film an even better one.",1056067200,,610,3.9754098360655736

2954818,4,B00004D2X8,"When this movie came out I rushed to a theater to see it. Even though I was not disappointed and very much enjoyed watching it, there were few minor but ever so obvious details that I could not except:
First - Rick O'Connell (Fraser) is captured during a battle and put in prison. After 3 years Evie (Rachel Weisz) buys out his life. When they first meet O'Connell's teeth are so white and shiny he is ready to do Colgate commercial. I guess Egyptian prisons do have dental care after all.
Second - throughout the desert cross, which took few days, Evie somehow managed to remain snow white, not even a single sign that she spent days in 120-degree sun.
And of course, the race to the City of the Dead, where camels outrun horses. Hm, can that happen?
Besides these few oversights, it's a great action movie. Visual effects are great. Action scenes are fast paced. Movie itself moves in a great pace.",1047859200,,900,4.4939024390243905

He brings down plague after plague on Egypt and they have to stop him. This movie has a lot of adventure and shouldn't be classified as a horror type film because it's more of an action \ adventure film with bits of comedy. I reccomend this move and also it's sequel, The Mummy Returns.",1045958400,,463,4.523809523809524
2954820,5,B00004D2X8,"Once you've seen the original Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee mummy movies, you might wonder how they might be improved.  The commercials for the movie were intriguing, but I was still apprehensive when I went to the theater.  I was not prepared for the combination of humor and horror in this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised at how well this movie exceeded the horror classics.  The DVD goes one better by adding extras and the opportunity to see this movie again and again.
We begin the movie with the story of Imhotep, played very well and evilly by Arnold Vosloo.  Imhotep has the hots for Pharaoh's mistress, played by Patricia Velazquez.  Unfortunately for all but the movie goers, the affair is discovered, Pharaoh is murdered, and Imhotep gets to suffer the hong dai (pardon my spelling), which means having flesh-eating beetles thrown into your sarcophagus just before it is sealed.
Scroll forward a couple thousand years to introduce Brendan Frasier as our hero, a less-serious and devil-may-care version of Indiana Jones, only much less knowledgeable and handier with guns and one-liners.  We get to meet Brendan fighting off desert nomads in 1920-something near Hamunaptra.  Of course, that just happens to be where Imhotep was buried.  However, this vignette is merely a connection between Imhotep's interment and the adventure that ultimately frees him.
We move forward into the future again, this time to meet Rachel Weisz playing librarian Evelyn Carnahan in Cairo.  Evelyn's brother has discovered a map and a key that appear to lead to Hamunaptra, and the vast treasures that are supposed to be there.  Unfortunately the map is ""accidentally"" destroyed, so Evelyn goes to find Brendan, who supposedly knows the location of Hamunaptra without a map.
As it turns out, a whole host of people make their way to Hamunaptra.  The Book of the Dead is discovered and is used to bring Imhotep back to life, and then the real fun begins.  From this point forward the mummy becomes stronger and stronger, terminating in a battle between mummified warriors, priests, Imhotep, Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weisz, her brother, and assorted others who have become involved in the story along the way.
While humor enlivens this movie in most of the scenes with Brendan Frasier, and many of the scenes with Rachel Weisz, this movie remains a horror movie with comic moments.  The deaths are played seriously, and some are chilling, if not horrible.  There is nothing funny about any of the death scenes.  Some scenes may even make you squeak, if only a little.
The movie was plotted quite well, with the action holding your attention from beginning to end.  The slow moments are few and set up the next action sequence so well that you never drift.  Furthermore, while there are a few plot inconsistencies, they are so minor that you may not notice them until you have seen the movie several times.  In case you haven't spotted one yet, here's an example.  Imhotep gets a huge case of flesh-eating beetles dumped into his sarcophagus, yet he has time to carve a message into the lid.  Furthermore, it was stated by Rachel Weisz that his death would have been long and slow.  Yet, everyone else that ran into the beetles died within either seconds, or at most, minutes.
Forgiving the minor inconsistencies, this movie has set the standard for mummy movies.  No worries about how the slow-moving mummy catches up to fast-moving prey.  This mummy is all action and has no problem getting what he wants.  For giving me a good mix of action, humor, special effects, and a few good scary moments, this movie gets 5 stars.",1044230400,,3622,4.890343698854337
2954821,5,B00004D2X8,"I don't know how many times I have seen this movie on cable but enough that I had to own a copy of it in my movie collection. I absolutely adore the sequel to ""The Mummy"" and its predecessor as well (haven't seen the prequel ""The Scorpion King""). ""The Mummy"" is reminds me a lot like the Indiana Jones series with the adventures and hijinks the main characters gets into. The premise of ""The Mummy"" isn't too far from the old horror movie but minus the bandages and overwrought lurching and instead is replaced with computer graphics and comedy alongside the action. Jonathan Carnahan (played by John Hannah) wasn't nearly as annoying in this film while he really got on my nerves in ""The Mummy Returns"". Some of my favorite scenes in the movies involved the spineless little weasel Beni played by the wonderful Kevin J. O'Connor. He brought the humor element to the movie with his treacherous and greedy ways. And of course watching Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo was as usual a pleasure to watch. I especially loved watching Imhotep suck the life essence out of the Americans. One of the funniest was when Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) and Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) entered the bedroom where Imhotep was kissing Evie. Just as Imhotep was about to attack Rick, Rick holds up the cat. The battle scenes were excellent and probably my favorite moment in the entire movie. I loved seeing all those mummies, Imhotep's priests and bodyguards (?). The visual effects in this movie were dazzling, especially when Imhotep conjured up his image in the sands when he brought down the plane that Rick and his companions were flying in. ""The Mummy"" may not be Masterpiece Theatre but I don't care. I consider this film a rocking good time.",1044057600,,1734,4.745033112582782
2954822,5,B00004D2X8,"... As for the movie itself, it had so much to get excited about.  There was comedy, romance, suspense and extreme respect for the creature depicted.  Imhotep stole the show, and he was, I think, just the way a monster should be.  Freaky, spooky, icky and almost godlike to a point.
And it was the supernatural action that really pushed this film over the edge.  Most Scifi and horror gets my appreciation based solely on the scale of power that the hero/villain possesses, and this one went above and beyond.  I mean, we have a guy who's basically a sand-God, but also has superhuman strength, is immortal, commands deadly man-eating insects and can summon the 10 plagues of Egypt!  That's world-threatening stuff right there... But anyways, spooky, yes, but that's part of it's charm.  Take the monster, creepyness and all, and cherish it.  I did...",1035331200,,851,4.820689655172414

2954824,4,B00004D2X8,"My elderly mother and I watched this version on DVD last Halloween after the candy was all handed out. Mommy is well into her seventies, and commented that she enjoyed the special effects and acting much better than the Boris Karloff version produced shortly after her birth. This flick is full of fun, harmless surprises with rarely a dull moment. Wonderful hot desert scenes with the leading lady often stealing the show. Thank God the plot unfolds in predictable fashion or it might have made a mummy out of mommy. My little five year old loved it too, and he now wraps his younger sibling in toilet paper, and they put on horror puppet shows for family and friends.",1030838400,,669,4.630252100840337

If you are just a minor fan of the film you will be happy with all the extras that are included.  I bought this before the second film came out, and got a free pass to ""The Mummy Returns"".

2954829,4,B00004D2X8,"This movie sort of suprised many people. It was full of virtual unknown actors, and was Frasier's first real attempt at a leading ""action"" star. To my suprise, he did quite well blending small comedic antidotes into an otherwise action-packed film. The storyline was also somewhat creative with the mummy's origin and curse. I did however have a slight problem with the method used to finally end the mummy's rampage, but aside from that this is an overall good film.",1023494400,,467,4.85
2954830,4,B00004D2X8,"When one buys a DVD, it's not enough for the movie to be good. The edition should also have something extra, measured by the amount of features. Fortunately, this edition for ""The Mummy"" fills both requisites. It is a great movie, and it has lots of features to go with it.
Even though it's officially a remake of the classic Universal monsters box, this version of  ""The Mummy"" has nothing to do with its predecessor. For starters, it's not a horror movie, but an action-adventure film, more familiar to the Indiana Jones saga. That blend between action and comedy that made professor Jones so famous has been imitated in a lot of movies, but this one, so far, is the only one who makes it justice..
All of the cast members do a great job, and all of them handle the action/comedy duality to near perfection. Playing opposite Brendan Fraser is Arnold Vooslo as The Mummy, and even tough he never actually speaks anything besides his ancient Egyptian language, his presence alone is almost supernatural. So it should be, because he has to fill in Boris Karloff's shoes (some big shoes, indeed). The level of the special effects is superb, specially when it regards the gradual regeneration of the Mummy itself.
In fact, since the producers knew that the special effects area is one of the most interesting angles of the movie, they packed this edition with a lot of features regarding that area. The documentary about the work of Industrial Light & Magic couldn't have been better, and the commentary by the director and the SFX designer is also a great addition. The only flaw, of course, is that it lacks some subtitles. So, in conclusion, this DVD passes the test well enough. It has great features, and the movie itself is very good too, so, what are you waiting for?",1022803200,,1771,4.676282051282051
2954831,3,B00004D2X8,"Ok, folks, this movie was ok.  However, anyone who would give it five stars is a moron.  This was not a GREAT movie it was a GOOD movie.  I also can't see how anyone can compare this movie with Raiders of the Lost Ark.  That was a GREAT movie.  It was nominated for best picture.  It was original.  How much slapstick comedy did you see in Raiders?  How many cliches did you catch in Raiders?  There is a difference between slapstick/stupid comedy and true witty humor.  It's obvious that most movie goers can't make this distinction.
The main reason that I like this film is because of the way they designed the Mummy (Imhotep).  Excellent casting there.  He was menacing and he was powerful.  His character carries this movie.
Unfortunately, there is just way too much comedy in this flick.  It detracts from any suspense or awe.  It's hard to get caught up in a movie when the main characters are constantly saying and doing STUPID things.
Like I said, it's a good movie.  But don't expect Ben Hur.",1021420800,,1001,4.5083798882681565

  This is the movie that is about ancient times way back in the days. Rick O'Connell know as Brendon Fraser played an awesome part in this movie. He was the main person that challenged our brains by learning about mummies.
  So, in conclusion if you saw this movie or haven't seen this movie then you will think that your mind is physically challenged by learnig about mummies and thinking that you are in ancient times, and that you will also think you did learn something by wathing this movie.",1020816000,,663,4.28

2954834,4,B00004D2X8,"Stephen Sommer's remake of the Boris Karlof original is a fun, if sometimes silly take on the story of the Mummy. A huge box-office success in the summer that gave us The Matrix and The Phantom Menace in 1999, this action- adventure is big on action, great SFX and witty laughs. Taking ideas from other films (Indiana Jones), it nonetheless is a cracking adventure tale that starts off great and builds up with a huge string of sequences and set pieces.
Sommers, who gave us The Jungle Book (1995) and Deep Rising (1998) gets a bigger budget, some great ideas and impressive SFX creations. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weiz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah, The Mummy is great pocorn- munching entertainment, with some amusing, well-timed humour and great action set pieces. Watching a CGI Mummy seek vengeance on the group who wake him up is so much fun. However, the story tends to get silly, and the script is rather wooden. And the film, inevitably, spawned the inferior The Mummy Returns. Sequels notwithstanding, it's a B movie with an A grade budget and a top cast, and the DVD is packed with tons of extras on the making of the film. Good fun.",1019520000,,1153,4.684729064039409
2954835,5,B00004D2X8,"This movie was a pleasant surprise because it actually had me laughing so hard I hurt.
It made me laugh when Brendan Frazier, (O'Connor), the man out to save Rachel Weeiz, (Evy), decided not to fight the guards he rushed. It is good to see that something with an old title has a fresh, new, and comical insight. I enjoyed the classical movie of the same name, but this one was great too.
Bennie's character was just as sandy as Imhotep's. His greed for wealth only surpassed his desire for self-preservation. I like Rachel's comment to him, ""Bad people always get their comeuppance in the end. They really do."" I don't know why, but I laughed at the cryptic prophecy. Her brother was somethng of a bumbling inept, but very comical.

2954840,4,B00004D2X8,"There is no escaping The Mummy. It did very well in theaters, and Universal Studios, which hadn't had a hit in ages. promptly decided to do a sequel, which it unleashed the next year. The affable Brendan Fraser seems destined to fit into Harrison Ford's shoes, at least his action/adventure shoes.
I have to write about this movie on two levels, because Egyptology is of the few subjects other than movies with which I am fairly familiar. I am touchy about the way my beloved old Egyptians are portrayed on screen. From this point of view, I found The Mummy to be a trashy work written by people with no knowledge or interest in history for an audience of similar ignorance. Yet, if I remove this personal bias, The Mummy becomes a whiz bang action-adventure comedy that is similar to, but not quite equal to, the three Indiana Jones flicks.
We are told at the beginning that, 3,000 years ago, a beautiful princess, who may be touched only by the Pharaoh, is having an affair with the priest Imhotep. [Both the princess and the priests have their skin covered by gold paint, and they look like they are about to go out to a hot Thebes disco.] Naturally, they are caught. The princess is slain, and Imhotep vows to bring her back to life. Before he can accomplish this, he is captured and faces a cruel death. A curse is put on him that is so powerful it has never been used before. [How can the Egyptians know how powerful it is if they never tried it?]
Fast forward to 1923. Rick O'Connell [Brendan Fraser] finds his regiment outnumbered by a never named enemy. The smart soldiers run away, the dumb ones dye. Soon, Rick is the last man standing. Just as he is about to be shot, some unnatural force causes the winds to howl and the sands to blow. The bad guys flee. Meanwhile, in Cairo, we find the lovely Evelyn [Rachael Weisz] and her larcenous brother, Jonathan [John Hannah]. Their late parents gave tons of money to some Cairo Museum, so now the kids play at archeology. Naturally their paths cross with Rick's, who leads them into the desert in search of a lost treasure city. Well, you can imagine whose tomb they chose to open in said city. Then, the real fun begins. I say fun, because this version of The Mummy concentrates a lot more on humor than on horror. Perhaps this is because the original has become such a camp classic.
Fraser is quite likable as Rick. While his range as an actor is large, this is the kind of work that will get him a ton of fans, not to mention a multimillion dollar beach house. Fraser should keep in mind that both fans and beach houses are at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of differing tides, and he would be wise to also pursue more serious fare. Hannah and Weisz try hard, but are overwhelmed by the special effects. Perhaps the best performances are those of Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep and Kevin J. O'Connor as the treacherous and hilarious Benji.
Some of the digital special effects are wonderful, while others, like the man-eating scarab beetles, are cheesy. On the whole, the technicians could have used some lessons from those who worked on The Matrix.
About that history. Seti I did not build the Great Sphinx, as implied in the opening. The plagues Imhotep uses are Hebrew. not Egyptian. They are the ones Moses resorted to. And so forth. The only thing that is remotely accurate historically is the film's portrayal of 1920s Egyptologists as more plunderers and thieves than archeologists.

I find this movie very hilarious thanks to convincing acting by Rachel Weisz, Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, and above all, ever-so-comical Kevin J. O'Connor. - even now he never failes to make me crack out laughing..
All the characters, though each is apparently one-dimensional which is quite common and normal for this kind of films (you surely do not expect complexity, it's just an 'action adventure' you know..), are well portrayed by all the cast, and that's a real joy to watch.
This movie stands true to the spirit of its genre and is quite a good one.

2954850,5,B00004D2X8,"one of the things that got me into the mummy series was the mummy returns. At first i kept on saying that the first one ""the mummy"" was nothing but comedy and silly jokes and the actors and producers were not even serious about the movie, but i only seen the first one once in 1999 when it first came out on video for rent at blockbuster. but one day i told my self since i loved ""the mummy returns"" so much i said to my self that why not watch the first one again and when i saw it I said to my self that the mummy returns was just another spin off. I mean don't get me wrong. both movies were hott but the mummy returns was missing alot of things that the first one had. #1 it was missing all of the mummy's powers and the effects were better in the mummy returns but not the story line. I mean the scorpion king that which i thought was the tightest character in the movie even though he didn't have that many parts in the movie is really having it's own movie orgin coming to theaters on April 19th this spring. But the scorpion King is a whole nother story and it is like trying to put both movies ""The Scorpion King"" and ""The Mummy"" into one movie screwing up the story line. Most people say that ""The Mummy Returns"" was much better than the first one and I agree with them, they did improve on the character's personality and plus it had more action so if you really like the series even though both of the movies were good I say go with the mummy returns.",1012694400,,1463,4.0657439446366785

Instead of the lumbering mummy of the old Universal films and, later in the remakes with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee for Hammer, this mummy is really something to fear.  I always thought why would anyone fear the mummy in the old films, he plods along so even a granny with a walker could outrun him!!!  As the mummy gains power, it is a very vital being with amazing powers.  The pace starts out fast, and keeps up the roller coaster ride, with AMAZING special effects.

2954854,5,B00004D2X8,"This is a terrific set of DVD's. For fun and information, they are much better than even the Star Wars DVD. For film enthusiasts, the commentaries are a delight. What is the most fun is that there are 3 and the ones with the actors give a LOT of insight. It's wonderful to hear Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr and Kevin J. O'Connor give their views and relate experiences. You learn a lot about the film in the technical sense from the director, but you learn a lot more about the actors and the human part from the other 2 interviews. The only problem with the commentaries is that Brendan Frasier's voice is a bit too low to hear over some of the movie. Also knowing all the goofs sometimes takes away from the film because you see them every time you view it.
The BEST way to get uninitiated people into viewing WideScreen (letterbox) instead of the horrific Pan and Scan/Full Frame is to do what they did here and include both. The nasty Full Frame will never compare to the WS version in ANY movie. With even a 27"" TV tube, the theater effect is really there.
I am absolutely delighted with this DVD and The Mummy Returns. As an ardent fan, I am very disappointed that there won't be a third installment. While the second movie is fun, it didn't capture the fantasy and comedy as the first one did. It focused too much on action and lost some continuity and some of the romance and fantasy. The Scorpion King didn't need to be featured so much because he took away from Arnold Vosloo's character and relegated him to the background.
I thought it would be absolutely riveting to have the O'Connells travel to Central America and have the mummy from an Ancient Mayan King come after them...think of the beautifiul sets, jade, gold and excitement...A real way to make the third a charm.

2954856,3,B00004D2X8,"This 1999 blockbuster harks back to the old 40's and 50's Saturday morning matinee serials. It also, and not too discretely, does the Indiana Jones thing too. The movie is totally cartoonish. Is that bad?. Of course not. The movie was meant to be a fun, entertaining ride, and it's just that. Brendan Fraser stars as our hero who is propositioned by Egyptologist Evelyn(played by the lovely Rachel Weisz), to guide her to the lost city of Hamunaptra. The City Of The Dead. It sounds charming. Once they start digging there, they find the mummified corpse of Imhotep. He was a man who was buried alive millions of years ago because he was sleeping with the pharaoh's daughter. Even back then men didn't know better. Anywho, he is revived by a spell Evelyn accidentally reads and all hell breaks loose. He plans on resurrecting his love, which includes a lot of gore and violence. He sucks the life out of the people who were there at the dig in order to be regenerated. Oh boy, there's always a catch!. The action scenes are fun and campy. There is a nice, quirky touch of humor throughout the film that is quite funny. The effects and make-up are all good. The cast is pretty solid, if not a tad mediocre. The sets are truly wonderful and are filmed wonderfully by director Stephen Sommers. It's a highly enjoyable and entertaining 'popcorn' flick that is only to be as such. The fun was sort of lost on the overstuffed sequel. Still, this is a entertaining movie.",1010361600,,1464,4.591603053435114
2954857,5,B00004D2X8,"I've heard a wide variety of mixed reviews about ""The Mummy"" so last weekend my wife and I watched it for ourselves. If you're a die hard Boris Karloff Mummy fan, you'll notice that several of the script lines are from the 1933 flick, although different people utter these. Boris was both Imhotep and Ardeth Bay while his old flame was Anchsunamun. Be prepared, they all show up in this new Mummy movie but as three different people (No Karis or Princess Ananka here). If you're looking for a Karloff/Chaney/Christopher Lee style leg dragging, bandage laden mummy movie, forget it. It's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Industrial Light and Magic, as usual, did a bang up job with the FX. To cut the long story short, it's a 21st century version of all of the old mummy movie plots with tons of action and amazing special effects. It's a new twist on an old story line, but hey, that's what Hollywood seems to have been doing here the past several years. We both rated it 5 stars because we both love action flicks and this one sure fits the bill.
If your're not into action or horror flicks(The Mummy is not really graphic horror), then don't even bother seeing this movie or its sequel (let alone rating it). However, if you are, then I recommend it highly.

2954861,2,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy borrows heavily from Indiana Jones, just look at the heros clothing. The story is about some ancient bad guy Imothep(Vosloo) that kills the Farao and meets his end in a most cruel way.
The story starts when Egyptologist Evelyn(Weisz) discovers a map to a lost city and hires the bold adventurer O'Conell(Fraser). Once at the lost city Evelyn unlocks the tomb of Imothep the evil Imothep.
The old mummy is (mad) and quite hungry for love, so he decides that he wants his old girlfriend(which by the way was the Faraos wife) returned to life. During his attempts to get his girlfriend back(he for some reason believe Evelyn is a reincarnation of her), he among other things release 10 plagues on Egypt and mannages to kill off alot of people. The movie also includes alot of flesheating bugs.
The movie have to be seen in a humoristic light, but even when viewed as such it falls short. Fraser is certainly no Indiana Jones no matter how hard he tries he simply lacks the right stuff, and no matter how many special effects are used the movie never reaches the level of movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1007942400,,1114,4.575

However, there a real big problem with the movie, and that's The Mummy himself. Frankly, he's a bore. He goes about screaming all the time, with his mouth getting wider and wider, thanks to special effects photography. And then, he seems to have one really favorite way of making himself disagreeable, gouging out eyes. How many times were they going to run that one? And the recurrent scarab beetles were too much already too. So there's an incessant sameness about The Mummy and his adventures that is annoying. I think the earlier Karloff version is a thousand times better than this one--see my review for a fuller treatment. Final analysis: okay, but more variety would have been better.",1005955200,,982,4.921686746987952

It is packed to the brim with extras, including the best type of commentary by director and designer, and mini features on the making of the movie, special effects, and even web-page equivalents (although viewable through your DVD player and not requiring a computer) on Egyptology and Egyptian artefacts. I would recommend any electronics shop hoping to sell some DVD players invests in a copy of The Mummy because it shows how good the format can be when used to its full potential. Turning to the film, this was a loving re-creation of the 1930s Universal horror movie, yet updated to 1990s standards. In Arnold Vosloo the film has an effective monster, and comparisons with Karloff are unfair. Rachel Weisz is the sort of beautiful actress that appeals to both men and women for different reasons, and funnily enough, George Of The Jungle star Brendan Fraser shows that that film was just an embarrassing hiccup and that he does have talent after all. And of course, the girls love him! The beauty of the desert long shots is matched by the attention to detail in the CGI effects, which shows how effects can enhance a film without making it seem (Terminator II?) like a lot of effects strung together in a loose plot. The fighting skeletons are reminiscent of the best Ray Harryhausen stop-motion work, and it would be good to see more of them in the sequel! There's a lovely scene at the beginning of the movie where a whole room full of bookshelves is 'domino-toppled'. This seems predictable but this sort of corniness is excusable in that it introduces the characters and gives us a contrast with the later action.

Thankfully updated with excellent special effects as well as humor and fast paced action.  It's an adventure movie, nothing more.  Brendan Fraser is a blast to watch as dual pistol packing, attitude slapping, down to earth ex-Legionnaire who finds himself teaming up with a couple of geeky librarian siblings, one of which happens to be the beautiful Rachael Weisz.  Fraser's character is hired by the two because he has seen something no one else has, the grave site of the lost city of Hamunaptra that holds the tomb of Imhotep, a powerful high priest in the days of the greatest and richest Pharaoh.  What follows is a semi complex adventure that keeps you hanging and keeps you entertained.  There are definitely some creepy moments and some aspects are intriguing, specifically the burials and rituals of the ancient Egyptians.  Some aspects are of course, stretched and unrealistic, but you can't expect Oscar material from some thing like this, who in their right mind would?  But The Mummy is a great piece of movie work and the DVD is full of extra features, so it is well worth buying.",999993600,,1214,4.798076923076923
2954885,5,B00004D2X8,"I have been collecting DVDs since nearly the beginning and have gone through my share of buying films twice in this format because of ""Special Editions"" coming out later on.  But I can't help but feel a little cheated when a studio releases a film on DVD as a ""Collector's Edition"", then six or so months later, re-releases the same movie as an ""Ultimate Edition"" with more extras added.  In The Mummy's case, the added extras include 2 more audio commentaries, one with star Brendan Fraser, who goes on and on about promising to tell us more about The Mummy Returns later on, then never does so, and the other commentary by Kevin J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr & Arnold Vosloo which is quite entertaining all around.  Other added extras include Storyboard to Final Film Camparison, Pharaoh Lineage, Photograph Montage & some highlights from Mummy Returns as well as its trailer (the DVD-ROM extras are slightly different as well).  Add DTS sound and your choice of a Widescreen Version on Disc 1 or a Full Frame Version on Disc 2 and thats what you get on the Ultimate Edition that you wouldn't get on the Collector's Edition.  One thing also worth mentioning: The Collector's Edition of The Mummy included 2 Theatrical Trailers for the film, but the Ultimate Edition only bothers to include just one of them...why?
As far as the movie is concerned I think it's a lot of fun and a nice throwback to the swashbuckling films of the 30s and 40s.  A nice balance of action, humor and plot development which always propells the film forward.  The special effects are still amazing and, I'm sure, will hold up for many years to come.
So, as someone who has taken the time to collect all of Universal's Collector's Editions on DVD (Dante's Peak was the very first released in this format) and has also praised Universal Pictures for the fine work they have done, this whole ""Ultimate Edition"" stuff just feels like a slap in the face.  And as I see more and more of them being released it makes me consider waiting on Mummy Returns and The Grinch to see if Ultimate Editions come out a few months after the Collector's Editions are released.  I just don't see why studios feel the need to bleed the consumer dry, after all the support we've given into making this format flourish.  Just be careful when choosing.  If you're a collector like I am, you'll want all the extras, and it's beginning to get rather expensive with studios pulling this crap.  In other words....

This remake of the 1959 classic is brilliant with the special effects and the realistic points of the plot. Brendan Fraser (""George of The Jungle"", ""Gods and Monsters"", ""Dudley Do Right"", ""Blast From the Past"") ignites the screen leading an all-star cast including Rachel Weisz (""Enemy At The Gates""), Arnold Vosloo (""Darkman""), John Hannah (""Sliding Doors""), Oded Fehr and Patricia Velasquez. This DVD is a must because of the many special features and the brilliance of the movie. The plot is great which combines Hebrew past with legend and tales. Stephen Sommers had really done it with this all-out-fun, special effects extravaganza.

There are some really terrific special effects that will keep you intrigued, as well as some suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat!

2954891,5,B00004D2X8,"I just rented this movie a few days ago and watched it. I thought it was dynamic!
Brendan Raser plays Rick O'Connell, an adventurer who knows where the 'city of the dead', Hamunaptra, is. A librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her brother, Jonathan, convince Rick to lead them there: Jonathan so he can find the treasure of the pharoahs and Evelyn to find archaeological artifacts. Only when they get there, trouble immediately starts. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan carelessly resurrects the mummy of Imhotep when Evelyn reads from 'the book of the dead'. And not only has he become alive, he has the power to unleash the '10 plagues' and all the power of the gods. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan have to stop him, amidst fighting against undead warrior priests, flesh eating scarabs, and more!
It has all the characteristics of an Indiana Jones type movie, adventure, humor, and action. Except that ""The Mummy"" has something much more: Suspense. It wasn't just the horror that scared me, it was the suspense that got you. Almost half the time, I was watching ""The Mummy"" behind my pillow! Almost the whole movie they didn't really show anything, it was left up to your imagination. And I have a good imagination... Don't get me wrong, it WAS scary and suspenseful, yet there were plenty of funny parts which I was laughing so hard I was crying! I was actually impressed by Brendan Fraser's acting, too. I've seen him play in some really dumb movies like ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""George of the Jungle"" so I didn't know what to expect from him playing in an adventure movie. And he did a great job! This is a good movie to watch while eating popcorn at night with the lights turned off at home. I really want to try to get this DVD.

The movie is in widescreen format on disc 1 and full-frame format on disc 2, so you have a choice in viewing it.  And theres not just one, but three commentaries on the movie--  one by director Sommers and editor Ducsay, one by star Brendan Fraser, and one by co-stars Arnold (Imhotep)Vosloo, Oded (Ardeth Bay) Fehr, and Kevin J. (Beni) OConnor.  The behind-the-scenes stuff is fascinating, including the feature on building a better mummy, production notes, deleted scenes, photo gallery, and some very interesting and educational background information on ancient Egypt--its gods, kings, customs, mummies, artifacts, and even a map of the region.  And theres the customary movie trailers, cast & crew bios, chapter index, and a main menu which is written in hieroglyphics until you select an item, then its transformed into English--cute!  The image quality is great and the surround sound quality is awesome!
There are also some DVD-ROM features that look interesting, but I don't have a DVD-ROM drive on my PC, so I cant check them out.  Theres a trailer for the video game, though, and it looks like a fun game, with action and movement like Laura Croft in Tomb Raider.
The movie itself is an action-packed adventure yarn in the Indiana Jones tradition.  Brendan Fraser gives a stalwart performance as the two-fisted, two-pistol-packin hero, always ready for a fight or a quip, who joins would-be Egyptologist Rachel Weisz ('Evie) and her inept brother on an expedition to find the city of the dead, Hamunaptra, and the vast treasure of the Pharaohs.  Patricia Velazquez as Anck Su Namun, the Pharaohs mistress, is one of the treasures, a knock-out in her body makeup costume!
What they find, of course, is the tomb of Imhotep, the mummy, whom they carelessly resurrect, with all his supernatural powers and his evil intentions.  Its here that the special effects take over, and they're pretty outstanding as Imhotep literally puts himself together by using body parts of his victims!  Its quite a departure from the early Universal mummy movies and the later Hammer franchise, and it gives the mummy a more horrific element!  He doesnt just kill you, he cannibalizes you!  But despite the gruesomeness of this premise, the movie has very little gore in it, hence its PG-13 rating.  The special mummy effects are really  impressive, but its the darn cockroaches (Scarabs) that are really scary!
All in all, this DVD set does live up to its claim of being the ultimate edition.  I recommend it to all collectors and mummy fans!",997488000,,2613,4.956422018348624
2954895,4,B00004D2X8,"This is a light adventure film, with a lot of spectacular violence, horror and fear. It is situated in the mythic land of Pharoahs, and later in Egypt. It refers to strange practices and beliefs that are like a whole fantastic world of horror and magic. The Mummy is the result of a crime against one Pharoah, who was God on earth, punished by the priests in the most stringent way : momification when still alive. Then it is the release of that monster and the necessary steps to stop him. It is pure magic with a reference to the Plagues of Egypt and a complex religious world that has to do with bad (black) and good (golden) magic and formulas. It is a constant reference to the world of the dead, to the other side of our world, to the underworld of damnation that is organized on the same pattern as the real (pharaonic) world and that only has to do with keeping the dead and the Undead in check, under control. What happens when it gets out of hand ? The Undead is released and golden magic has to be found and used to bring in the supreme guardians of this underworld that have the power to make mortal the immortal, and hence give power to the living to kill the ex-immortal and rid the earth of the curse, scourge and calamity.
The exploration of this mythical world of Ancient Egypt remains partial and even superficial. The most accurate details are avoided to protect the public against real horror that is a lot more horrific than literary horror, even that of today. The special effects are also there to give that attractive look and feel that will capture some younger audience. We regret a little that those magical myths are not explored in more details, and we dream of  The Servant of the Bones  by Anne Rice, or even the coming  Queen of the Damned  by the same.
Entertaining and funny, and in the end the scholar-minded are the saviours of the world, and they get some kind of treasure as a reward, whereas the greedy are all destroyed, which is after all nothing but justice.

The love scene between Imhotep and Anck Su Namu was dramatic and unforgetable. The romatic development for Rick and Evelyn was equally good and delightful; and most importantly - it is believalbe. I really enjoyed watching interactions between Rick and Evelyn. How can you deny the scene, in which Evelyn got drunk, tried to kiss Rick and missed, is not one of the best romantic acting ever?  Do you notice the subtlness in Brendan's facial expressions?  Although this is an action movie, the personalities in this movie are more humane than the ones that are of the same genre.

The Med-ji, Pharaoh's Bodyguards mummify Imohtep after a feeble attempt to ressurect Anck-Su-Namun from the slaughter.  Imohtep suffers the Hum-Di the worst Egyptian Curse, meaning he gets nasty flesh-eating bugs poured all over him. Anyway three-thousand years later the embodied Ardeth Bay watches Men fight over Hamunaptra the city where Imohtep was buried. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) barely escapes with his life. Three years later after halarious library scene in which Evelen Carnahan (Rachel Weitz knocks over the whole library and a clever prision Scene in Cairo, Rick O'Connell Leads her and her brother Johnathan (John Hannah) to Hamunaptra. Four men also seeking hamunaptra open a cursed chest and Evelen foolishly reads from the book of the dead. Imohtep comes back to life unleashing the ten plagues of egypt which i will note is only five of the plagues. Imohtep sucks the people who opened the chest dry and regenerates. I can't give away the end In which Ardeth Bay, Rick and John combine forces to Kill Imohtep and rescue Evelen. Joining the film, the comic releif (besides Johnathan) Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner) and the prision Warden (Omid Djalili) and the Egyptoligyst (Johnathan Hyde).

Most were convincing, and breathtaking. Such as the recreation of Ancient Egypt, and the sand-wall. The watery spirit that went into Anck Su Namun was kind of campy, but fit into the movie. The casting was also great. Brendan Fraser was awesome as our hero, Rick O Connell. Fraser did well with his dialogue and actions, and was good with the one-liners. His reactions were funny too. Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Her character, Evelyn, went from being very clumsy (a cute scene) to being very brave (her face-off with mummified Anck Su Namun). John Hannah (Jonathan) was our comic relief, and so was Kevin J. O'Conner who played the wimpy Beni. Oded Fehr made a good co-hero, and Arnold Voosloo was the villian, the mummy. Voosloo has the creepiest eyes, so that fit well with his character. As for the dvd itself, picture and audio are great.

They hire dashing American Rick O'Connell to take them there, not knowing that Hamunaptra is the resting place of the evil-to-the-core Imhotep, (former) high priest of Osiris and.  Imhotep is undead, t. i. his soul is stil locked to this world, and has tolerated the most horrible of Egyptian curses - the Hom-Dai - for 3000 years.  He was the only man ever to be cursed this way, for his crime was to sleep with the Pharaoh's mistress (Anck-su-namun), kill the Pharaoh and defy the gods in an attempt to undo Anck-su-namun's suicide.
When Evelyn accidentally releases Imhotep from his grave, and with him the ten plagues of Egypt, the now-immortal Imhotep is bent on one thing:  Bringing Anck-su-namun back to life.  This he can do in one way:  He must find the Book of the Dead, its key, Anck-su-namun's mummy, and one human female.  He will then perform the ritual for raising Anck-su-namun's soul out of the underworld, insert the soul in the mummy, and kill the person, so Anck-su-namun's soul may be united with a ""fresh"" body.
He has chosen his victim:  Evelyn.
Now it is up to Rick (and Jonathan) to save Evy and send Imhotep back to the underworld - before it is too late!
This movie is everything you can ask for- and more!  I haven't seen the like of it since Indiana Jones!  Prepare - beware - behold!!!

Some good special effects seem woefully out of place when draped on a sophomoric story line, like icing on stale cake.

2954914,5,B00004D2X8,"This 'Ultimate Edition' has a number of improvements over the previous DVD version(s). A DTS soundtrack has been added to the widescreen theatrical presentation of the movie which is a noticeable improvement in sound quality over the previous Dolby Digital-only version.
A second disc contains a zoomed-in full-screen presentation which was previously available as a separate 'Special Edition' (along with the same extras as found on both widescreen discs). This 'close-up version' is very revealing of subtle nuances such as the expressions on actors' faces which are hard to read in a shrunk-down letterbox (or VHS transfer) and since the camera is always moving, you still get to see the glorious movie-set on either side. In addition to the mutitude of extras found on the previous 'special edition' (and Disc One of this set) Disc-Two includes a collection of (letterboxed) trailers and a preview of 'The Mummy Returns' which revealed a little too much of the plot for those who haven't seen it yet. Disc-Two also features some storyboard-to-finished-movie comparisons with the two letterboxed frames stacked one above the other. There are some before-and-after special-effects sequences similar to those found in the 'Building A Better Mummy' featurette but which replay the corresponding sequence from the full-screen version. Almost hidden away in the elaborate menu is a photo-montage which is accompanied by over four minutes of isolated Jerry Goldsmith score recorded in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. Probably because of the extra detail in the picture, there is no room for DTS on Disc Two.
If you already own the widescreen or full-frame 'special edition' of this title, it's worth buying the Ultimate Edition for the alternate framing, DTS option and 'The Mummy Returns' preview.

Subsequent viewings have improved the film. I enjoy it more each time as I catch new subtlties and nice touches - one of the things for which DVD is so well suited. The special effects, about which so much has been said, are nothing short of phenomenal.

An entire second disc is devoted to such goodies as a fairly thorough listing of Egyptian gods, maps, and other fascinating details of ancient Egyptian life. Several language tracks, spot on surround sound options, featurettes, commentary and trailers, plus previews of the new sequel round out the package.
I'd have liked some outtakes - they'd go particularly well with this genre of movie - and some deleted scenes, but otherwise this Ultimate Edition DVD is the total package.

2954921,4,B00004D2X8,"One of my favorite features of DVD technology is the ability to add a voice-over commentary to the film.  ""The Mummy"" Ultimate edition DVD has three; one with director Stephen Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay, one with star Brendan Fraser, and another with Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy), Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay), and Kevin J. O'Connor (Beni).
The commentary with Sommers and Ducsay is perhaps the most revealing of the three.  The filmakers are suprisingly honest and candid about the process of making the film.  Sommers frequently expresses his frustration at dealing with extras (uncredited actors) and isn't above pointing out the mistakes in his own movie (watch for the arm of a crew member to pop into frame during the bar scene).
Fraser's commentary, on the other hand, is more like watching an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Though he reveals a little about his part in making the film, you can tell he is enjoying himself just as much as you are, if not more.  At times he breaks out laughing as if he's seeing the film for the first time (witness his reaction to Beni's multilingual chanting when first coming face to face with The Mummy).
The commentary with Vosloo, Fehr and O'Connor is informative but my least favorite of the three.  Vosloo loves to talk and does a lot of it, often interrupting his costars to tell a story or plug the sequel (another thing he does a lot of).
In short, if you enjoyed ""The Mummy"" and frequent the trivia section of Internet Movie Database, you'll enjoy the commentaries attatched to this film.  You'll never look at the movie the same again.",988848000,,1593,4.729241877256317

So a note to DVD fans; the only difference between this version and the original ""Collectors Edition"" is a few added interviews and the inclusion of a DTS mix of the soundtrack. The picture transfer itself is exactly the same, which is saying a lot since it is reference quality. (Especially on a 16x9 display through component video inputs). If your sound/home theater system is equipped for it, check out the DTS mix - it is, in many respects, better than the Dolby Digital mix on the first disc (better channel separation and richer bass and vocal tones), but again, only if your system is set up for it will you notice any difference. If not, (and if you're not a die-hard fan of the film) there's no need to re-buy this one; however, if you've got the amps and the equipment, this one is a sure way to show off what a good home theater system can do - and blow away your friends at the same time!

Everyone has a different opinion on its taste, texture, health content,etc. But it boils down to did you like it enough to eat it again?  Movies are the same thing, everyone has different opinions on the movies, its acting, special effects, closness to the original (if a remake), etc.  But it boils down to this did you have fun watching the movie and would you watch it again.
To me movies are just that entertainment, anyone that tries to take anything else away from a movie needs to get laid (pardon the language).  The only reason I watch movies other than documentaries is to be entertained and escape reality for awhile.
The Mummy did that for me.  Sure the acting wasn't the best but it was fine for this movie.  The special effects were awesome and justify sitting through this movie and owning it.
Was it better than the original.  I don't think that is the question that needs to be answered.  The orignal is a classic and will stand in time as one of the best.  When I saw this movie I decided not to compare it to the original, I wanted to watch it as its own entity.  I did and without any preconceived expectations I enjoyed the movie.
Bottom line is that this is a fine movie to go see and own.  Don't judge it on the original, just enjoy it and be entertained and you will be fine.

2954928,4,B00004D2X8,"If you buy/rent/watch this movie with the expectation of seeing something akin to oscar-bait, then you're going to be seriously disappointed. However, if you watch this movie with the only expectation of being entertained, I believe you'll really like it, if not love it. The script is a spinoff of the original Mummy, but with an updated theme -- and naturally with the new writer and director's personal touches. Since the basic plot and storyline have been covered by the editorial reviews and several personal reviews, I won't bother to repeat what they've already said. But, since so many people seem to have given this movie poor reviews because they (for some reason) thought this movie was going to be a duplicate of the original, even though it says everywhere that it's not (can they read?), I will reiterate this point -- Don't expect a clone of the original Mummy, because this isn't it. Watch the movie without any preconceived notions, and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more..... It's an adaptation of the original Mummy with basically the sameplot.... Aside from the opening scene depecting the French Foreign Legion preparing to do battle with the native troops (which, I will remind that poster, actually was something that happened frequently during the period of time the movie is set in!), the only ""army"" of ""people"" the main characters go about trying to destroy are mummies!  So shouldn't that phrase actually be ""defeating an army of computer animated (you know, not real?) UNDEAD""? And the last time I checked, ""undead"" wasn't really considered a race...
Finally, sure the script is a bit cheesy, but the fantastic special effects make up for its few shortcomings in my opinion, and the acting really isn't as bad as some people seem to have so harshly criticized. It's a fun movie, IF you'll allow yourself to enjoy it for what it is, instead of trying to compare it to what it's not  -- i.e., the original Mummy or any Indiana Jones movies (which by the way, the original Mummy that this movie was based on was created LONG before any Indy movies). Once again, if you're looking for oscar-bait, this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for an entertaining way to spend an evening with a bowl of popcorn, then give The Mummy a try - you'll probably like it.",988156800,,2287,4.7727272727272725

Brendan Fraser hams it up delightfully as the roguish ex-legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is roped in (forgive the dreadful pun!) into helping Egyptologist Evelyn played by Rachel Weisz to locate the lost city of Hamunaptra and its many wonderful treasures.  Unfortunately Hamunaptra has many secrets, some of them very, very nasty and the nastiest secret of all is the evil priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo.  I have to admit Arnold Vosloo made the film for me, as did the young woman who played the Pharaoh's mistress and his lover, Patricia Velazquez, she was superb, shame she had such a small part in the film!  The special effects were amazing, and the humour rib chucklingly funny.  I mean who can forget the moment when Imhotep's still decomposing body falls out of the coffin and Rick, Evelyn and her brother Jonathan played stupendously by John Hannah look at each other and say simultaneously, ""he's still so.......JUICY!""  I howled with both laughter and fright.  This is a great film with some gruesome moments but mostly in my opinion this is a comedy of horrors that makes you both jump and laugh in fright.  I won't give away anymore of the plot but it is worth seeing and a double disc compellation special makes it twice as good.

Brendan Fraser's O'Connel starts off as an Indy wannabe. However, by the time the final credits role, he has become his own character.

The special effects are magnificient and though the acting is a bit cheesy, one must not forget that this is not a dramatic masterpiece.

2954937,4,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is one of those unique movies that really delivers in all fields. It's a rip-roaring adventure in the vein of the Indianna Jones films, while incorporating chills and humor into its story as well. It has all the basics of the 1932 original version of the movie, but this version is much peppier, much more entertaining, and takes on both a serious and a comedic approach. This, combined with the use of cutting-edge special effects and a knockout cast of actors, make the movie a prime example of typical summer fun that turns into a lot more than just that.
Borrowing the plot of the old movie, the high priest Imhotep is condemned to forever be cursed for having a torrid love affair with the Pharaoh's mistress, Anck-Su-Namun. He is given a ritual burial, which involves being buried alive in a coffin full of flesh-eating scarabs. This gives the movie a chance to show itself off as fashionable horror, not going into the extremely graphic details while giving us slight chills in the spine. This will carry on throughout the rest of the film, which is one of its better aspects.
Moving ahead in the film to the 1930's, Rick O'Connell, a roughneck who also has his charms, crosses paths with librarian Evelyn Carnahan and her gold-digging brother Jonathon, who has a map that leads to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. O'Connell agrees to take them there, and soon, it becomes a race of who will get there first to retrieve the treasure rumored to be hidden there. Upon investigating the interiors of the city, they come across a book, and soon they unleash Imhotep and all of his curses on the world. This is the point at which the movie becomes a race against time to stop the mummy before he completes the steps to becoming whole again.
The movie has a lot going for it, and the fact that it realizes its status as an action adventure/romance is what keeps it going. The movie never really stops moving; there are certain scenes that move a bit slower to allow for character development and such, but this movie is mostly fast-paced action and thrills, delivering a tense and throttling experience which will make you cheer and smile. When the plagues begin descending upon the land, our heroes must move even faster to stop the curse, and as they do, so does the movie.
The movie is undeniably fun. There is a lot of comic relief thrown into the mix of the plot, and is a combination of one-liners from characters as well as goofy body language and actions which will have you rolling with laughter. The character of Beni is the centerpiece for the comic relief; he is the turncoat who deserts the Americans to aide Imhotep in his search for the items he needs to regenerate. He is cumbersome and gangly, and the quiver in his voice is a riot. one scene in particular involves Beni pulling out a collection of sacred symbols and chanting foreign verses to try and ward of the mummy. Comic genius!
There are a lot of special effects employed for this film, and they do well in telling the story where regular camera shots could not. The most stunning of these effects is the ongoing regeneration of the mummy, who goes from moldy, rotting corpse to partial skin and muscles, slowing becoming whole. The many layers of his body are seen in meticulous detail, each movement matched to the specific body part. These effects are seamless, and work very well in this film. Most of the other effects involve the plagues brought down by Imhotep, which include immense sandstorms and flocks of scarabs. The scarabs are the most believable effect here, and through animation, the filmmakers are able to create thousands of them, creating the illusion that danger comes in numbers.
There is also some moments that border on the extreme, but not entirely, and the movie is admirable in the way that it does not cross that line. The regeneration sequences show Imhotep's form as being dried out instead of wet and gooey, which makes us go ""Ew"" without making us vomit. As Imhotep takes his victims one by one, the filmmakers show this by using lots of sound effects and creating the illusion instead of showing us the actual event. All we see are the leftovers, which, like Imhotep, are dry and decrepit.
The cast employed for the movie is remarkable, and gives us one of the best performances for a film of this genre ever. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, and he is the ideal embodiment of an action hero. He's not so much a young Indianna Jones as he is his own action figure, and his character becomes something for other action heroes to be modeled after. Rachel Weisz is sweet and humorous as the lovely Evelyn, and she also makes a remarkable damsel in distress as well. She has guts, which is wonderfully portrayed in her acting ability and charisma. Arnold Vosloo plays the evil Imhotep, the perfect person for the role. He makes us believe in the fact that the mummy is not really evil; he is only doing what he was destined to do by reviving his long-lost love. Two of the supporting roles, John Hannah as Jonathon, Evelyn's brother, and Kevin J. O'Conner as Beni, do a masterful job of adding comedy and liveliness to the story,
As a serious horror film, ""The Mummy"" would not be as good. It would seem more confused and muddled. It's light-heartedness and comedy make it something better, giving us a healthy, even balance of laughs, thrills and chills. It's a movie for young and old alike, and becomes an interesting spin on the original. It gives the old story a fresh look while keeping the old scare tactics used before.

Upon finding the tomb, they not only break a sacred seal, but unleash the mummy who must collect various incanter beacons to return to his full flesh form.
First of all, Brendan Fraser is not an action hero!  He has about as much clout as Keanu Reeves.  Not once did I believe that this guy could be an action star.  It seemed that this was Brendan saying ""All right!  I'll never be Indiana Jones, but here's as close as I'll ever get!""
The pacing of the story and other characters also fall through, the comedy relief is tepid, as is Rachel Weisz as Evelyn.  Like a character out of thet Indiana Jones series, she is the girl who is the misfit who eventually turns out beuatiful in the end, but she has a major attitude problem towards the leading man (think Willie Scott from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).
The only saving grace for this film that gave it 2 stars was the effects work by Industrial Light & Magic. The Mummy is about the most recognizable full-body motion capture figure since ILM created the T-1000 for Terminator 2.",983318400,,1593,4.394557823129252
2954940,5,B00004D2X8,"When this film was released in 1999, many critics bad-mouthed this movie, comparing it to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Fortunately, most of us didn't listen to them and the Mummy made almost as much as the Matrix. The comparisions are not fair, Raiders was more of an adventure movie with a serious tone, the Muumy is a homage to all the great monster flicks of the Silver Screen.
Incorporated in this film is plenty of humor, mostly one-liners by Brendan Frasier, who plays the swashbuckling hero out to stop the undead creature. Rachel Weisz plays the feisty heroine who is out to uncover the mythical lost city of Hamunaptra, which is said to contain the ""wealth of Egypt"". Her brother is played by John Hannah, as her brother, who is out not for scientific gain, but for personal wealth. Frasier leads them because he was there at the city once, and is going back in search of treasure, with the funding of Weisz's character.
But treasure-hunting soon turns into mummy-hunting as they awaken the long-dead priest Imhotep, who is now out to restore his body and revive his deceased lover. What follows is a great mixture of horror and adventure, with some of the best special effects ever in a movie.
As for the DVD, the picture is excellent, even for a DVD, with terrific color representation and very good digital sound reproduction.

I enjoyed Steven Sommer's Deep Rising, but this is ludicrous. Fraser churns out the typical Hollywood tough guy character. Rachel Weisz, is nice to look at, but not to listen to.

However, they could have spent less money on special effects and more on historical accuracy.  There are several historical goofs...both subtle and glaring.  I was a little put off when, after a lovely shot of the Giza Pyramids, a baritone-voiced narrator said that it was ""Thebes.""

Actual sample dialogue: ""we're in big trouble."" Followed by the Mummy growling even louder and then, ""We're in REALLY big trouble.""

Well, the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"" is quite comfortable being ""Chopper"" instead of ""Yacky Doodle"".  There is plenty of bite with absolutely THE BEST DVD widescreen audio and visual technology available! (we'll leave the more sophisticated and intellectual version to Boris).  Either way, it's a great show since it avoids serious accidents, and the ""blood plasma"" never gets mixed up!  Rachel Weisz puts on a ""Snagglepuss"" of a performance, and steals the show outright!  Her finest moment may have been the somewhat overlooked but excellent acting she displayed while walking the mysteriously moving ladder (something more likely to happen to ""Scooby Doo""), and then having to explain the entire strange sequence of events to her rigid, no nonsense boss (the ""Mr. Ranger"" type)!  Brendan Fraser is reduced to ""second fiddle"" despite his ""Quick Draw McGraw antics both before and after Rachel bails him out of his incarcerated ""George of the Jungle"" dilemma.  Perhaps the hangman's words to Rachel's character offers the best summary: ""Are you telling me that this filthy, godless, son of a pig (not ""Porky"") knows how to find the city of the dead!!??""  Fraser couldn't seem to make up his mind if he wanted to be ""Pixie"" or ""Dixie"" throughout the entire two hours so he settled for ""Secret Squirrel"" (after all, he had all the tools and knowledge that everyone needed).  Oh Doctor!  Does Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor (no relation to Zsa Zsa or Eva I suspect)) need some medical treatment after ""bugging"" the audience (not to mention our heroes) as the weasel villain personified??!!  After his type of ""dishonorable discharge"", not even the likes of ""Snoop and Blabber"" could track him down!  No less than seven, countem, seven, actors portrayed ""The Mummy""--Not even granny's ""Precious Pup"" would dare sneer at that obsessive, compulsive example of pulling out all the stops!!  All things considered, our characters are ruff 'n ready for a big blast of special effects and old fashioned fun--Even if it's not an old fashioned movie!

In 1932, Boris Karloff walked around REALLY slow, grunted like he was constipated, then he strangled people, again, REALLY slowly, to kill them.
 This time around, our mummy can open his mouth very wide, and spew locusts all over Egypt, along with several other annoying plagues.  Can you imagine some Egyptian woman, starts yelling at her husband, ""BILL!  For the last time, put in for that transfer....Yesterday the rivers were blood, today it's raining fire.  I can't handle all the plagues around here!""
 If you enjoy the Indian Jones trilogy, you'll enjoy The Mummy.  Actually, skip the Temple of Doom, that one was a real stinker, but The Mummy falls nicely into the wacky, action flick genre with some archeological fringe for a little depth.  I wonder if movies like this one annoy real, honest-to-God archaeologists.  I mean, it makes it look like archaeology is a matter of finding a really cool looking map, get yourself to the X, then, with your trusty native sidekick, dig until you find something, like the leafy outfits Adam and Eve wore when they figured out they were naked.  I mean, how COOL!  If it was that easy, everyone would do it!  Hold your horses, the summary is coming up next.  The year is 1290 B.C.  The High Priest Imhotep and the Pharaoh's main squeeze, Anck-Su-Namun are a little bit too smitten with each other.  The Pharaoh finds them, they make like a sushi chef and chop chop, see ya later Pharaoh.  But the guards rush in, and Anck-Su-Namun does herself in while Imhotep fleas, vowing to bring her back to life.
 As Imhotep is performing his ""Bring Girlfriend Back to Life"" chant, he and his loyal followers are all mummified and buried.  BUT, Imhotep is buried alive along with a lot of really nasty scarabs who lick their chops at the thought of eating a big tasty evil guy.  Next comes the ""oh, of COURSE"" ditty.  They put a curse on this guy.  And not just any curse, mind you.  They put a curse on him which is reserved for the most evil, sinful, wicked baddest dude.  It would be a pretty lame movie if he got the curse reserved for the 17th worst guy.
 Along with the curse, is the ""Don't Wake This Guy Up"" clause.  Ya know, waking up a mummy can't ever be a good thing.  Think about it.  You've got your ten plagues, and aside from that, you've got a guy who hasn't seen a bar of soap in 3000 years.
 So, what happens?  We fast forward to the year 1923.  We have the dashing French Foreign Legionnaire Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), and Evelyn, the little rich girl with the ability to read ancient Egyptian and decipher hieroglyphics.  Other members of the wagontrain include: Evelyn's brother who's a lush, a wiry fellow named Beni and some uncouth, rowdy Americans.
 This band sets off across the desert to find Hamunaptra, where it is believed that the wealth of Egypt was buried at one time.  So whose bright idea was it to also make Hamunaptra the City of the DEAD?  Hellooooooo?  Think about it first people, I mean, really.
 As one would guess, woopsie doodle, somebody opens Imhotep's sarcophagus.  Then, well, darn the luck, somebody is accidentally reading that little part in the Black Book of the Dead that brings Mr. Musty back to life.
 The thing that's great about this movie, is that all the gore is off-screen.  Meaning, you might hear the scream or see the shadow, but not witness the actual removal of someone's eyeballs or what have you.  Another great thing, they are way too busy for a gratuitous sex scene.  I appreciate an action flick that doesn't have the male and female leads stop and say, ""I realize there's a big stinky mummy chasing after us, but let's smooch.""
 You can watch the movie to catch the rest of the story.  The informational stuff is fun. Getting pieces of information to keep you in the story until the climax.  The Mummy did that really well, I felt, because historical exposition can be really boring if what you really want to see is a dead guy scaring everyone.
 This movie is a lot of fun, the action is quick and the special effects are really cool.  There are one-liners galore, they poke fun at Americans, and they make fun of the very genre the movie is.  You'll be entertained.",970358400,,4331,4.5708712613784135

2954962,4,B00004D2X8,"To compare this film with the classic original is, to say the least, like  comparing apples and oranges.  The 1932 Boris Karloff film is a suspenseful  and highly original romantic horror film with depth to spare, while the  1999 version is little more than a high-tech, fun-filled action-adventure  fantasy film with a few chills and thrills along the way.  But in that it  is excellent!
Now be assured that the original accomplishes its goals  with a great deal more success than the new film does.  While it is a  fast-paced, highly imaginative adaptation, whatever heart is left from the  original story, tends to be overshadowed by the excessive but typically  excellent ILM computer graphics.  The script is somewhat weakened by the  dialogue which, at times, sounds too modern for the mid- 1920's.  But the  plot and storyline, which was adapted by director Stephen Sommers, is so  involving and the players so appealing you just can't help but get caught  up in the atmosphere.  And to be honest, it would have been hard if not  totally impossible to make a more exact remake of the original that could  have stood on its own.  The 1932 film was nearly perfect and you can't  improve on perfection.
Brendan Fraser cuts a dashing and appealing figure  as the typical action-adventure hero definitely in the mold of Indiana  Jones.  He is matched every step of the way by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn, the  librarian turned explorer.  Their scenes together show a chemistry that  could result in being cast in other movies together.  John Hannah as  Evelyn's brother Jonathan is once again very appealing.  He never fails to  impress me with his way of wrapping himself around a character.  And Kevin  J. O'Connor as weasel Beni is very funny and quite perfect.
Arnold Vosloo  paints an entirely different picture as the title character, A.K.A.  Im-Ho-Tep.  Again, while comparisons with the original should be avoided, I  feel compelled to say that Mr. Karloff's performance in the original is an  incredibly heartfelt and soulful one.  Of all the characters in both films  this is the one that should have the most substance.  But as depicted in  the remake, Im-Ho-Tep is the most superficial of all.  Vosloo, largely due  to the script and aforementioned computer graphics, has little else to do  but bare his rather well-developed chest which, in my humble opinion, is  largely the reason for his appeal in this film with so many of the viewers.  But his performance is as shallow as they come.  Still, he attempts to  combine eroticism and sexuality with evil and is at least partially  successful.
The editing and photography are superb and the music score by  the great Jerry Goldsmith adds a great deal.  Director Sommers shows a  command for the action-adventure genre that should be explored further in  future films and his script blends adventure and comedy beautifully.
The  DVD looks and sounds great.  Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay provide an  informative and very entertaining commentary that really takes you behind  the scenes of the making of the film.  The other supplements include the  usual documentary and deleted scenes.  There is also a special section that  details how the special and visual effects were created.  These features as  well as many others make the disc well worth [the price].  But just a word of advice: get the widescreen  edition.  This film, as well as most other standard editions of films,  loses too much when the viewer can only see half the picture.
All in all,  THE MUMMY-1999 should stand on its own, separate and apart from the  original.  For my money, I'll always love the Karloff film more (you can  read my review of that one elsewhere at amazon.com), but isn't it nice to  know that here the filmmakers were able to take that original premise and  craft an enjoyable, fast-paced comedy-fantasy-adventure that works very  well.  After all, in this case, what more could one ask for!",969235200,,3941,4.8812785388127855

Now it is going after them since they  broke the curse. Do they have time to destroy the mummy before the world  comes to an end. This is a good action epic, visual effect, and great story  telling. With great actors like Brendan Fraiser, Rachel Weisz,John  Hannan,Jonathon Hyde,Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo. This is a great  movie to see.",969062400,,676,4.387096774193548
2954964,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is, at heart, an adventure serial from the 1930's, which means  it is in the same genre as the Indiana Jones films. While it never achieves  the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has  its moments.
The cast, for the most part, is outstanding. Brendan Fraser  plays another variation on his hunky-cartoon persona, swaggering and  swashbuckling like an old pro. Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love  interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's. The chemistry between the  two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.
Arnold Vosloo makes  a somewhat disappointing mummy, however. He never seems very menacing --  largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a  mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.
Whether or  not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you  feel about computer animation. There are some shots, particularly of the  mummy, that look like low-grade ""Hercules&Xena"" quality  effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial  Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have  looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).
Regardless,  the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun. There is an element of ""Army  of Darkness"" style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers  some good old-fashioned thrills and chills.
No one will ever mistake The  Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too slick, too post-modern, and at times  embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around  spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).

This movie is formula horror with nothing original or unexpected, but with  some of the greatest special effects I've seen.(ILM, you've done it again.)  First of all:  Why do people in horror movies always read aloud from  ""The Book of the Dead"" knowing that something is going to come  back to life and that very bad things are going to happen?  Will they never  learn?  Second:  Why must there always be a damsel in distress type?  I  guess that's so there's a reason to be a hero.  Third:  Do they not know  that when you cut up these revived dead people the separate parts always  seem to be able to go on with their evil deed without all parts being  present?  Sheesh!  We've got our standard hero, our standard greedy fortune  hunters, etc.  This movie has been done many times before in many different  forms, but the comedy elements make this one fun.  No, it's not great art.  There aren't any great performances.  But if you're looking for something  to do on the weekend, this movie is worth checking out.

2954967,3,B00004D2X8,This is a pretty good movie. The special effects were outstanding! I have to agree with an earlier viewer that stated that comparing this 1999  version to Boris Karloff's version is a mistake!  Although some parts of  the story were similar there is no comparison. This movie is worth watching  for the special effects alone. The story has some weak spots but overall I  found it enjoyable and would watch it again.

2954968,3,B00004D2X8,"I kmew that when I went to go see this movie that it wouldn't be all that. Here's a hint to the public: Never see a movie that shows all the action in  the preview. This is a sign that there won't be much to look foward to  because they used at least 85% of it already. The script in this movie  desrves a D-. Brendan Fraser appeared to have an I.Q of 10 with his famous  line,""Question?"". Rachel Weisz appeared to be spaced out at  times. I hate when they make the women in movies so helpless. It was the  typical storyline. Kill the bad guy. go save the girl. Get out of the  pyramid before it falls apart. The only thing that saved this movie was the  fact that it was so funny. It should be in the comedy section instead of  action. I laughed alot in this movie. And as far as I'm concerned that's the  only reson I would ever watch it again.

I'm not a fan of horror but  this film really changed my mind about horror flicks.  It mixes action with  a comedy which makes it even more enjoyable and a little more lighthearted.

2954972,3,B00004D2X8,"This movie treads that ever so warn road of the evil mummy, and how warn it is too. A subject that is simply an old richual for its leaders is as  ever manipulated into Hollywood using an evil mummy to exploit that ever  mythical idea that mummies are nasty things that walk with out-stretched  arms.
To be fair this is a good adaptation of the whole Egypt subject,  yet while it is extremely pleasing on the eye, it is very difficult to  follow this as it seems to rely on coincidence far more than just the odd  scene. The effects are big budget and fantastic, and to go with it the  acting is, in the main, brilliant. British stars who are more known in  their native England for TV roles - John Hannah and Rachel Weisz - are as  ever good performers, though the lead from Brendan Fraser is at times  wooden.
The script is basic, and very predictable, if you can't guess  what is gonna happen most the way through - then it will be a surprise. In  the nick of time lives are saved, sure death situations find Fraser  escaping, and rather cheesily the bad mummy is defeated and the guy gets  the girl at the end. No surprises there then.
The movie is by no means  all bad - it has a quirky script, and original character settings and the  it generally ties together well as a plot, despite being far-fetched this  is just for a bit of fun, for we all know mummies will not just appear. The  kind of holes in this though are clear, and a good example is when the town  is bombed and you see buildings destroyed - yet at the end, they are  magically all pristine again - could this be the ever present magic of the  mummy, or something we are supposed to miss as they create the typical  idyllic ending for the relationship ending.
Basicallyt his is a no  surprises film, which is easily predictable and rather cheesy in the route  it takes. It is a subject matter that is interpreted in a manipulated way  to create a good versus bad situation as realism goes out the wondow. To be  fair, if you select this kind of topic realism is never going to be key.  For all its low points on the topic and plot, it does hang well together,  and the acting is in the main good, and the story is not laboured and  despite sitting there crossing off every cheesy manoeuver and coincidence,  this is at least pleasing to watch in general, and the subject matter of  Egypt is interesting. Not something to expect much from, and not really  something to get excited about, but if you like a run of the mill big  budget movie you'll at least enjoy the movie - although you will spot all  through the formula that is used far too often in recent years......!",965088000,,2642,4.292089249492901

John Hannah  was standout.  Very funny guy.  ""Bad luck, old mum,"" and  ""Im-ho-tep,"" were probably the funniest lines in the whole movie.  The special effects were stunning and the action was pulse pounding.
A  couple of quibbles with minor spoilers:  if the beetles ate Imhotep,  ""very slowly,"" in the words of the female lead, then how come  they devoured that poor guy in the passageway in like .5 seconds?  And how  come the Imhotep took the eyes of Burns, who wore glasses?  I expected to  see the mummy staggering around like Burns did when his glasses wer knocked  off.

2954980,5,B00004D2X8,"I think those who have criticised this movie have made the mistake of comparing it to true horror films.
To place the 1999 Mummy beside the Karlof version is a mistake. I agree that The Mummy (1999) owes far more to  Raiders of the Lost Ark than the tense, claustrophobic horror classic of  the 1930s.
It's supposed to be fun. Even the cast don't take themselves  seriously and there are some superb moments of pure slapstick fun. I  particularly enjoyed the character Beni as the bumbling, hapless, wanna-be  arch villain who probably endures more pain than Imhotep.
I note the  movie has also endured criticism for not being historically accurate. Well,  that's neither here nor there. In reality Imhotep was a renowned architect  and High Priest. Our guy is something else entirely! He is a work of pure  fiction, as are the rest of the cast - Seti existed, but whether he was  murdered by his staff and his girlfriend or not, who knows, but probably  not. Ankhesenamen (Imhotep's girlfriend) also existed..she was the wife of  Tutankhamen.
The Mummy does not pretend to be an historical docu-drama,  nor a serious horror film. If you approach it with this mind set then you  will be disappointed.
It's an adventure story, full of action, handsome  heros,lovely heroines and great special effects and self-deprecating  humour. (I actually prefer the ""juicy"" mummy, with bones clanking  and flesh rotting, to the bandage wrapped guys)
The only sour note from  my perspective are the myriads of silly ""priest mummies"" that  swarm all over the place toward the end. Far more than Imhotep had in his  employ when they were all alive; they are all rather exaggerated to the  point of being plain foolish, rather than funny.
Overall, The Mummy is  great chewing gum for the mind and what is wrong with that. I recommend it  and I am eagerly looking forward to Mummy 2.",961200000,,1865,4.79559748427673

There is kinda of a touching romance between the lovely young  British girl and Brendan Fraser's character. However, the more enjoyable  charasters were young lady's brother and a shady ""Eastern"" man,  who was looking for some wealth and adventure on somebody else's  expense.
The story of the Mummy itself and of some strange men in black,  calling themselves Mummy guardians or something like that, is completely  preposterous.

2954996,5,B00004D2X8,"When it comes to movie genres, horror is in my top five,probably after science fiction. However, the remake of the Mummy isnot a horror in the traditional sense. Most people associate modern horror with gore-laden special effects, forgetting that true fear comes from the unknown and urgency developed from carefully built up suspense. The 1999 remake of the Mummy isn't a horror film, unlike perhaps the Sixth Sense-which I wouldn't show my nieces or nephews, but the Mummy is just good clean fun. We are treated to a great ensemble of actors, breath taking sets and funky special effects, thanks to Industrial Light and Magic. The film also doesn't take itself at all seriously, making you laugh just as surely as you will thrill to the action sequences.
 The film opens with a stunning view of Thebes-city of the Seti the First where we see the sphinx under construction (okay, so they missed by a few hundred miles on that one!).  Anck-su-namun, the Pharaoh's untouchable mistress is continuing her affair with Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo)-a priest of probably Anubis. Getting caught in the act by Seti, they kill him just as the Medjai (who were actually the Egyptian police force) break down the doors. Anck-su-namun then kills herself as Imhotep escapes after promising to resurrect her. He and his priests steal Anck-su-namun's body and take it to Hamunaptra where he attempts to do that, but all is lost when the Medjai storm the sarneche where her body was being prepared. Imhotep is mummified alive for his crimes-cursed to spend an eternity undead locked within a sarcophagus, being eaten by nasty little scarab beetles.
 Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, a down on his luck Legionaire who led his garrison to the legendary city of Hamunaptra-the city of the dead in 1923 (Note: the city didn't really exist and is based possibly on the Necropolis of Egypt). They find the city, oh yes, but they also find hundreds a Tuareg warriors bent on killing everyone to prevent them from find the evil that dwells beneath the sand. O'Connell escapes after being chased too close to the statue of Anubis where Imhotep is buried and a small sand storm that whips up around the statue that frightens off his attackers, allowing O'Connell to escape with his life. The next time we see him it's three years later and he's about to be hanged for having a very good time.
 It is in Cairo where we meet Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), a beautiful and befuddled librarian desperate to prove herself an archaeologist to the sexist old-boy network in England. Rachel delivers a beautiful performance of the slightly nerdy expert of Egyptology. We also meet her lush brother, Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah), who has stolen a puzzle box key from O'Connell that has a map to the fabled city of Hamunaptra. The two rush to find Rick after Evelyn's boss `accidentally' burns the map in a candle flame. They find him at the Cairo Prison where Evelyn must bargain with sleazy warden for O'Connell's life by promising him 25% of the riches they find in the fabled city.
 From there the adventure of a life time comes to life as O'Connell reluctantly agrees to lead Evelyn and her brother, and the sleazy warden, across the desert sands to the ancient city. They also have a run in with the `bloody Americans', who are out to plunder Hamunaptra's riches, and the two groups must work together in order to survive-first by an attack by the Medjai, then after finding the Book of the Dead, Evelyn incants a spell that kind of...sort of...brings Imhotep back to life, whose sarcophagus they found earlier that day. The Americans steal Anck-su-namun's canopic jars-the vessels that stored her organs after they were removed. As the mummy comes back to life, it becomes a race to escape back to Cairo, followed by Imhotep who begins to kill the American thieves one at a time for their crime, using their life essence to rejuvenate himself in the process. Imhotep also develops a crush on Evelyn, who he plans to sacrifice so that Anck-su-namun many live again.
 The Mummy, start to finish, is a wild romp that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Thanks mostly to the interplay between the main characters who play off each other magically. It doesn't set out solely to scare, but does offer up some genuinely creepy moments. With exemplary production values-be they sets, effects or costumes, The Mummy delivers heaps of action, laughs and adventure of a type akin to Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fine pedigree to follow. But the Mummy also harkens back to a time when movies were made with a certain eye to quality-there is nothing in the film that made me lose my suspension of disbelief, because it is a solidly written yarn. It has unforgettable moments, be it O'Connell's back stabbing friend Beni as he runs through a collection of holy symbols and prayers in attempt to stave off the advancing mummy. Or Rick and Evelyn's budding romance and the interplay that captures these pleasantly goofy characters wonderfully.
 The Mummy stands out as my favorite action film of 1999-beating out the Phantom Menace and the Matrix by a fair margin. The other bit of good news, besides this gem of a movie, is that they are making a sequel, and one can only hope that it is every bit as good as the first. This is an excellent film and can easily take a place next to some of the best action films of all time-like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard, The Terminator, Big Trouble in Little China, and Aliens. It delivers at every turn-excitement, adventure, a few scares, and romance. Great fun and I highly recommend the letter boxed version over the pan-and-scan so that viewers can see everything.

2954997,5,B00004D2X8,"What a surprise this was, I thought it was going to be some slick eye candy movie with little else, but thankfully I was wrong, what a thoroughly enjoyable film.  The characters were funny and varied with lovable quirks,  the Action and special effects were top notch, (I LOVED THOSE CAT  SCENES! ), and Imhotep is such a suave Mummy, you cant help but admire  him, his honeylove, sorry cant remember her name, is of course impossibly  beautiful, with her fashion sense Im surprised anyone could remember her  name! Our bumbling Good looking Heropeoples were a riot, kept me cackling  throughout the movie.
Now Ive read a few of the reviews, and was  surprised at the comments about people finding so many historical flaws in  this movie, I cant quite understand why they would bother, I mean this film  is fictional! , no actual walking talking living dead creature exists,  (well maybe a few models! ) no skies raining balls of fire (unless you  count a meteor shower or New Years eve! ) no swarming insect hordes that  eat you alive (Okay so theres mosquitos and sandflies etc...) and no  fanatical secret organisations plotting our doom (Political, Religious,  Children toy manufactures not withstanding!) Okay so maybe it is real, WHO  CARES!  this movie rocks, it kept me entertained and I didn't mind the  ticket or video price when I had to get a copy.
If your expecting a  historical doco-drama then don't even pick it up, but if you want to try an  action comedy adventure then this is for you (if it helps that O'connell is  Lara Croft in drag then dream away! ) ENJOY!",957312000,,1580,4.6521739130434785

2955010,5,B00004D2X8,"Everyone has a complaint about this or that, but let's face it. They weren't out to recreate the original Mummy (with Karloff), but to put new faces into it. Brandon Frasier is great in this film with the right amount  of sarcasm that makes you laugh without getting on your nerves. The detail  put into the characters interaction is what helps makes this film  delightful. The special effects are good, but are definately outshined by  the acting. It's one of those movies you through on while you do something  else simply because you wouldn't mind hanging out with the characters if  they existed in real life. The humour is genuine and not forced, it has the  right amount of thrills. With the Indy series nearly dead (rumours abound  of a fourth, but only rumours), I wouldn't mind them taking Brandon  Frasiers character to fill his shoes. The era of the time, with all it's  mystic and prim and properness just lends well into the mysteries of the  unknown. Heck, Tommy Lee Jones went from the fugitive to US Marshalls, so  let them do it here. And all around great fun film. People's  disappointments with it stem from it possible being TOO much fun with out  being more seriousness. But nothing is forced and the humour level is  perfect. Not to mention the DVD itself is chockful of goodies like  commentaries, histories, mini-games, etc. Great attention to detail for DVD  extra's.",954633600,,1392,4.733333333333333
2955011,5,B00004D2X8,"I didn't care for the film when I first saw it in the theater, but I have to admit I was with friends who were vocally underwhelmed by it and in a multiplex cinema where sound from another film was very intrusive.  Since  seeing it on full screen, I have purchased the DVD and have to admit the  picture definitely grows on a person.  The ""ouch"" of the obvious  historical goofs (If the pyramids--which are on the Giza plateau near  Cairo--can be seen from Thebes about 500 miles south, it must have been one  hell of a clear day! ) gives way to the supreme satisfaction of searching  them all out!  There is an entire web site just dedicated to the Mummy's  historical inaccuracies, so one has to know some very bright people were as  entertained as I by this movie.  In fact if I were doing the sequel, I'd  probably include a few, letting it be well known, just to keep the history  buffs entertained.  My chief disappointment in the film is that the reason  for Imhotep's passion for Ankhesenamon is not really very clear.  I realize  she looks better than most of us with her clothing painted on her body, but  I rather doubt that beauty alone would be sufficient to account for the  priest's near obsession with the lady.  I couldn't help wondering what she  has that the rest of us don't, when Imhotep's only concern was to spend  eternity with her.  I suspect if she's just beautiful, the guy could be  designing his own peculiar brand of hell!  Actually, with what I know of  history and with the information I received from the film, I came up with  my own very satisfactory solution.  Perhaps Mr. Sommers will enlarge on the  history of the couple in the next film.  Mr. Frasier's hero was very  energetic and engaging.  One could hardly avoid comparing his efforts to  keep his own lady alive to Imhotep's plight.  In many ways the two  characters are much alike, which makes their ultimate contest that much  more poignant.  Ms Weis was delightfully dizzy, reminding me that to be  very bright is not necessarily to be very ""together.""  Mr  Vosloo's Imhotep is quite good.  Over and over I am amazed by the  gentleman's capacity to almost physically remake himself.  His ability to  imply history for his characters is notable, as is his ability to convey  meaning through body language and facial expression.  Probably one of the  best characters however, is Benny, O'Connell's erswhile ""friend.""  His capacity for self-preservation and self-advancement is delightful.  Perhaps he represents just a little bit of all of us when he runs for cover  in the face of adversity.  .",953942400,,2589,4.652561247216036

Let's be positive. Brendan Fraser is a great young actor who deserves truckloads of applause for his work. He gives a  wry, sardonic, yet somehow enthusiastic perfomance - outstanding, given he  must have been prancing around in front of a blue screen half the time. The  scenery and special effects are enchanting, and are the kind of thing DVD  can improve immensely. It's a carefully timed and well-tailored story  that'll move smoothly over your senses.
And then the movie's over, and  you think: 'Oh.' Because in the cold light of day ""The Mummy""  just doesn't do enough. As per recipe, all the greasy and untrustworthy  characters are offed in satisfyingly unpleasant ways. Our rude and  uncultured hero gets the prim and proper heroine, who screams a bit and  runs around while he wields a sword. Everything just wraps up a bit too  neatly. And because the whole thing is played slightly-for-laughs, it's  hard to feel any real anxiety about the drama. You know the ending  already.
Definitely see this movie. It'll entertain, and you'll see some  good acting and some genuinely beautiful scenery. But try before you buy.  And don't expect Shakespeare, or even Dickens.",951004800,,1264,5.067961165048544

The special effects and humour  are great.  For me, John Hannah is excellent as the brother and has some of  the best lines - look out for the way he copes with the mass of people  under Imhotep's power as he runs for the car!

Naturaly, the directors  could not avoid the numerous misconceptions about the Black Land: the  mummy's name is Imhotep (who was the builder of Jhoser's pyramids, not a  vizier, pharaoh, or anything close), the mummy's powers are invoked through  a ""Black Book"" and a ""White Book"" (Egyptians didn't use  books in the modern sense of the word, moreover, they didn't use locks or  keys). Of course there is the peevish sidekick to the main villain (a  nuisance, mainly). The movies barely has any refernces to the horrors of  the original film, and, whenever any comedy scenes are played, the sombre  atmosphere kills them. The Mummy is trapped in an eteranl deadlock which it  is not likely to escape if it preserves its contradicting qualities.",949708800,,1139,5.059139784946237

At least they could've included something of a plot, but it was nowhere to  be found.  People said I should see it merely for the effects, although  after seeing it, I didn't think they were any better than ""The  Matrix"".  I don't care for the acting, either.  It's an example of  what poor casting can do to a film.  Now for my attack on the MPAA, I felt  that the level of violence in this film was too much for a PG-13 rating.

Pros:
*The movie is a visual masterpiece. The visual and sound FX are breath-taking.
*Heart-stopping action.

*Brendan Fraser was terrific. I never though  he could be so.
*Rachel Weisz was terrific too. Real eye candy.
*Very  beautiful desert settings.
*Fast and intense camera  movements.
*Excellent score.
*A super cool villain.
*Definitely the  hottest and coolest extras you will ever find. In fact,the extras are enough  reason to buy this DVD.
Cons:
*Although Stephen Sommers did a better  job than any other director in trying to authenticate the Arabs,they  weren't 100%.There were some Lebanese accents in Egypt,and a lot of the  language isn't clear enough.
*Some overacting in jokes,namely Rachel  Weisz's brother(in the movie).

However, the story starts out okay but soon enough fades into cliches and a chaotic swirl that seems to exist just so they can throw in corny humor and unneeded violence. The characters are terribly tiring and annoying, I kept hoping the story would improve and redeem this film, but it didn't. The constant dumb humor kept getting in the way any kind of eerie or exciting moods that might have been created. Universal should be ashamed, they had the money and the time and instead of putting out a modern horror classic they put a big stinker that that tries to combine Indiana Jones with Army of Darkness, but fails miserably.

The producers bet and won that people who loved the Indiana Jones movies  would flock to a reasonable facsimile.  The movie proved to be very  popular-and deservedly so.  Action, humor and suspense are woven  seamlessly.  The director resisted the temptation to overdo special  effects.  The casting was near perfect.  The result is a superior  actin/adventure movie, easily the best since Stephen Spielberg decided not  to do this stuff anymore.  Understand. The director is not nearly as good  as Spielberg in building tension. But to say that your director is not as  good as Spielberg is a little like complaining that an author doesn't  measure up to Homer. The real surprise of the movie is Brendan Fraser. The  man is the ideal action/adventure hero; and I wager that until this movie  was released, few suspected it. Looking back it's easy to see that he would  be: Tall. Distinct looks. Unique voice.  An easy charm. But before, well  who would have thought it. If Stephen Spielberg wishes to revive the Indian  Jones series, he should take the role from Harrison Ford (too mature for  the role now) and give it to Brendan Fraser. He's that good. The DVD  version is very good in the way DVD is.  Out-takes. background.  How the  movie was put together etc. But of course the real reaon to buy is the  clarity; and here the clarity is first rate.

First of all the interactive menus are animated and when you enter the languages, do not do anything and the whole movie score  is hidden on there. In Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosploo (or whateveR)  there are trailers hidden in their bios. The making of the special effects  is very interesting and tells us alot about how they made each and every  speck of dust in the film. It also has a feature that tells us how they  made every special effect by itself with before and after montages. There  are two theatrical trailers one for For Love Of The Game, and another one  for End of Days (Which wasn't good!). They are under the Universal Showcase.  The soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1 is exceptionally clear as is the  picture. It also has 3 deleted scenes which aren't nothing special, and it  has theatrical trailers, Egyoptology 101 which is a little essay on the  mythology. ITs packed with stuff and I recommend it greatly!",943488000,,1024,4.451612903225806
2955091,5,B00004D2X8,"Director/Screenwriter Stephen Sommers delivers this new take on the mummy legend. His mix of humor and horror is terrific! The casting was very, very worthy, and the plot was downright exciting! This film begins with a  prolouge in ancient Egypt, where the priest Imhotep and the Pharoah's  mistress Anck-Su-Namun murder pharoah Seti the 1st. He is condemed to be  buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles, and an eternity as one of  the undead. Flash forwrd to 1926, were librarian Evelyn (Rachel Wiesz) and  her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) recruit legionarre Rick O'Connell  (Brendan Fraser) to lead them to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. In route  they meet up with a group of American cowboys out to plunder the same site.  The general bickering ends when they accidentally revive Imhotep's corpse,  who needs the flesh of his desecrators in order to regenerate! More over,  he unleashes the biblical ten plauges of Egypt. Before you can scream  ""Mummy!"", Rick and everyone else are fighting for their lives and  trying to save the world! Harrowing thrills and spectacular visual effects  by Industrial Light and Magic, make ""The Mummy"", one of the most  draw droppingly spectacular films of the year. Right up there with  ""The Matrix"" and the highly over rated ""Star Wars: Episode  One: The Phantom Menace"". See this film, you won't regrete it!",943315200,,1358,5.04954954954955

That was some neat monster, he certainly was scarier than any other MUMMY  in filmdom.  I thought the special effects were pretty darn good, there was  a lot of energy that the real actors had to put into those scenes, to make  them really click.  Actually, I liked the story, too, kind of gave it a  nice romantic touch, especially in the scenes with the Pharoh, who's to say  that this sad tale didn't happened, or not!

Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in,  there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running,  guns firing, dust flying.  These action sequences are nothing more than  time fillers and BOREING to watch.  The humour in The Mummy was a total  distraction and offset the mood of the entire film.  It turned into this  hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.
The  romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing  here.  It has been replaced by mindless special effects, and what seemed  like an endless array of confusing action sequences.

Okay, okay, I know hes' the bad  guy, but really -what did he do other than sacrafice all for the woman he  loved - and really, don't we all fantasise about such deep devotion?

Special affects were good.  The rest of the movie  just stunk.  Plot holes to drive a truck through. poor acting and some of  the worst dialogue I've ever heard were enough to move this into my list of  all time worst movies.
Of course the inane premise should have been  enough to warn me off.  Let me sum it up.  Egyptian High Priest is screwing  around with the Pharoah's mistress.  He does this out in the open where  Pharoah can walk in.  Pharoah comes in and with his bodygaurds right behind  him.  The kill him.
What do they do to punish this high priest?  They  put a curse on him where if he is ever released, he will be the most  powerful creature to ever walk the planet and end all life as we know it.  Ummmm...  Why not just torture him for a while and then kill him....",939600000,,950,4.115384615384615

I enjoy movies that entertain me,  serious movies like Shindler's List help you learn something about life.  For this type of movie, who cares.  This is the kind of movie the motion  picture was supposed to be a century ago when it was first invented;  entertain you.  This is entertainment at probably it's best level.

I missed this one in the theater, but I can honestly say I probably would have been as bored with it there as I was watching it at home.  The story  line is too predictable. And the only difference between this version and  the Boris Karloff version was the edition of 90's computer FX.  The FX were  spectacular, but the acting left a lot to be desired.  It was very hard to  get to like, or dislike any of these characters.  They seemed one  dimensional at best.  One laughable scene has the fierce Imhotep sitting in  a hotel room with one of his victims as if they are best buddies having a  beer.  Why does the all powerful priest feel the need to be social with his  victim before he finishes him off...give me a break! (He wasted no time  with any of his other victims.)  And at one point when he could have  finished off Brendan Fraiser's character he decides to let his hapless  zombies do the work.  Come on!

Brendan Fraser plays an Indiana Jones type character. In my  opinion, the only movie where he was better was ""Gods and  Monsters"". The other cast members are very good also. As always, I  never know whether to hate or feel sorry for the ""monster"". I  don't think anyone would be disappointed in this movie. Kick back and  enjoy.",938995200,,474,4.529411764705882
2955157,2,B00004D2X8,"The MUMMY has great digital effects and stunning production values. However, great effects alone do not make a good movie. The script is tongue-in-cheek, often played for laughs. Therefore the element of surprise  and horror is often compromised. The chracters are often irritating. The  only exception is Arnold Vosloo as the title chracter who is is given litte  to do. Brendan Frazer as a gun totting, loud mouth hero who shoots at any  thing that moves (even a wind storm)is hammy. It is hard to believe this is  the same actor who turned in such a fine performance in GODS AND MONSTERS.  I will give Fraser the benifit of doubt and blame the script and direction.  The other chracters are just as predictable. The DVD, however will not  disappoint movie fans. Every detail involved in the making of THE MUMMY is  explored. A good commentary track, a 50 minute documentary on the digital  effects is better than the film. Jerry Goldsmith's music score (which I  enjoyed) is presented on its own over the language menu. Unfortunatly you  cannot skip ahead, back or pause the music track, otherwise it resumes from  the begining. Get the MUMMY DVD if you enjoy learning about movies are  made.

The effects were very good and it was down right  funny as well.  Maybe it's just because I'm partial to monster movies.  Maybe it's because I don't try to look too deep into a 2 hour sitting of  scrolling pictures.  Maybe it's because, and maybe you'll agree with me  maybe you won't, it's just a freakin' movie folks!!  This is a must see if  you look at movies as a way to escape the every day hum and drum of life.  If you are looking for a movie that speaks to you, try something with  Shakespeare in the title and don't waste your time reviewing monster  movies.

Despite TVs getting bigger and bigger, another moron executive declares ""Most people watch on their tiny 3"" screen of their phones"" so you can't have a slightly wider image, you have to maximize the screen space.

And that is why movies shot in 2.39:1 are cropped for 16x9 and zoomed in, so you lose information on the sides and the image is less sharp.

Next, as an Asian living in the US, I know very well that most (if not all) American Chinese do not know how to speak/read Mandarin Chinese, so why force them to do that in movies - I did not understand a single word General Ming uttered, meanwhile Michelle Yeoh being a veteran actress could barely pulled off her pseudo Chinese lines, not to mention her daughter Lin.

If you are going to change the female lead... change her name. Fans of this franchise have enjoyed the chemistry between Rick and Evelyn.  When you put another actress in those shoes, you made that relationship cold and unfeeling.

Now, on to the review.

Rick was a jerk.
Alex lost his English accent;
Evelyn lost that loving feeling.

3188217,3,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy became my ""go-to"" movie after the first time I saw it. I loved the campy horror-comedy aspect of it and the script was face paced and well written. I don't have a tv subscription, so I turn on a movie when I'm doing housework or to play in the background while I'm cooking or knitting, or whatever. I've turned on the first two movies so many times I've lost count. I watched this movie one time and one time only.
In the second movie, we're introduced to Alex, who is an adorable ten year old with the cutest British accent and the expected mischievous streak. In this movie, he's a grown man with an American accent and a lot of resentment towards his parents. Rick and Evie have an argument over who caused the rift; ""You were cold and ignored him"" ""you smothered him"", etc. Totally unnecessary plot line in my opinion.
John Hannah was perfect as Jonathan and had the funniest lines in the first two movies, but he's more of an after thought this time around. He wasn't the only underused actor, and with this much star power the script should have been so much better.
I give it three stars because I thought the acting was good even though the script sucked (seriously - Yeti??) and I couldn't agree with the two star ""I didn't like it"" rating.
 I found it to be an average movie with above-average potential and expected so much more from this franchise. Watch the first two, but skip this one.",1504483200,,1410,4.423076923076923

The new Mummy (Tom Cruise) can't be compared with this one all though they have a bit of similarity.

The film manages the difficult task of evoking INDIANA JONES style action without coming across as campy. Too many films in the pulp adventure genre don't take their subject matter seriously and are directed with tongue firmly in cheek. Sommers doesn't do that here and Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Oded Fehr all give solid performances as the heroes of the film. Arnold Vosloo's Mummy has a believable background that almost, but not quite, has you rooting for him to re-unite with his long lost beloved.",1495065600,,674,5.026785714285714

There isn't one single character that doesn't tie into the purpose of our main characters' goals - which is to first uncover the history and treasure then stop the mummy from ending the world - without having a reason to be there in the first place. Even the drunken Captain *Spoiler Alert* had a purpose to the storyline that ran along perfectly with his own desires/goals to go down in a cloud of glory like his fellow comrades before him. Every character has a purpose, and a bit of enough background to have a reason to be there. It's funny while still keeping the intensity and thrills of the story.

3188288,5,B00004D2X8,"I've always thought there needs to be a new type of awards show, one that specializes not in movies that deal with personal wars or the human condition, but are just good, fun movies. Instead of being the Oscars. They would be ""The Mummies."" Whenever I watch another movie that's just trying to be an enjoyable romp for a couple of hours, I'll rate it ""X Mummies out of 10"".

Point is, I see The Mummy as the perfect popcorn flick. It knew exactly what it wanted to be, and it was that to the fullest. And it plays with its own tropes. The characters are practically aware of the cheesy sort of situation their in, and they own their roles. Brendan Fraser, who has just had the most rotten luck in the past decade or so, is at his best here. He plays a character who is simultaneously super-skilled and very vulnerable in a fight, intelligent but able to make the occasional dumb joke. In short, he's the perfect lighthearted action hero.

The story itself is very tightly told, and there's relatively little wasted space. The CGI is clearly dated at this point, but it doesn't stand out quite like the Rock's face does in the sequel. But overall, the best part is that The Mummy is willing to have fun with itself. It's a classic tale of derring-do that we just don't see enough of these days. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. And if you have seen it, see it again. It's just a great way to spend a couple hours and come away smiling.",1483574400,,1446,4.332103321033211

Rachel Weisz's shoes are big to fill and Maria Bello did a nice enough job, but she's no Rachel (although to be fair, who could be, really?). And as many reviewers have mentioned, the characters are just not the same, and you can feel a lack of continuity in who they are, how they act and the chemistry they had together.

But the plot, the new cast from China and the special effects certainly have plenty of redeeming qualities, and it's still worth a watch, even if you loved the first two. Just don't watch this one after the other two!",1480723200,,712,4.227941176470588

3188340,4,B00004D2X8,"Rick O'Connell and his motley crew are back for one more ""Mummy"" film. Though the series was getting on in years, this one actually makes me a bit sad, to tell the truth.

Why does it make me sad? Well, not only is it the end of an awfully fun series, it's a film that I've come to see as a sort of parable about the importance of hard work.

There are a few things about the third ""Mummy"" that really throw people off. First is the acting: the actor who played Alex was probably the worst, and while others have commented plenty on the talents of a few other members of the cast, I would say he's the one who really deserves this nomination for a completely lifeless Hayden Christiansen performance. I'm sorry, but it was bad even for me.

The second part is the dialogue. Some of the dialogue is meh, some of it is downright terrible, but a little of it is as funny and quotable as the first two films, so evidently someone with some brain stopped in on the script once in a while.

Sadly, both these flaws are very noticeable, which results in a terrible review from many people. This is a shame because the rest of the movie is really quite lovely. The action sequences are kinetic and large, and there's a lot of them. The final battle at the end remains one of my favorites in a film due to its sheer scale and concept, neverminding the solid execution. The visual design really helps tell the story, and is some of the more interesting and creative I've seen. Great costumes, very cool terracotta warrior monsters, really gorgeous production design, honestly. All of it really stuck with me. Most of the cast is great as always, from grumbling about mummies to hiking great distances to whacking at bad guys. Michelle Yeoh is thoughtful, tough as nails, and super gorgeous (I think she's immortal in real life, too), and Jet Li gets to look good in armor, ride a horse, and kick people in the chest, all specialties of his. The soundtrack by Randy Edelman is beautiful- it sounds exactly like a film like this should, from the rich Western orchestra to the different moods of traditional Chinese instruments, it's worth it to buy on its own.

All in all, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" was a film dragged down sadly because there were a few people working on it that failed to pull their weight. This is by no means a reflection on the majority of the people working on the film, who definitely went out of their way to give us a fun, explosive, and visually creative film, and by no means did they disappoint.",1473292800,,2526,4.423655913978495
3188341,5,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is best described as a blend of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider with some pretty great visual effects. It's a solid adventure yarn with a great heart and an awesome cast. Brendan Fraser is a lovable rogue with a penchant for dual-wielding. Rachel Weiss is the brain of the hero team, a sensible archaeologist with some skills that turn out to be just the right ones for saving the day. John Hannah is purely comic relief, but he's fantastic at it. Oded Fehr is a Magi, a wizard with mad sword skills who can also use a machine gun, and Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez are the toughest, buffest mummies ever. There's so many great action and comedic scenes, and plenty of quotable dialogue. The art direction and the late Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack take us to just the right place for this sort of romp, and the CGI monsters are really good for 1999. All in all, a really quality action film that rises above the dross from ""good bad"" to just plain good. See and see again.",1473292800,,989,4.5

3188379,5,B00004D2X8,"This movie puts the original Universal Mummy to shame. It's been turned into a swashbuckling, live action flick with enough one-liners and derring-do to satisfy all.

Not one character in this movie is found wanting, from the mummy himself, who's portrayed as vengeful, determined, and undoubtedly sexy for a change as well as being very much included in the action, to the mercenary and cowardly Beni are well-cast and brilliantly played. Harking back to the original in the use of the title character's name, we find Imhotep the high priest, Anck-es-namun the courtesan, and Pharaoh Seti again playing their rolls ikn a love triangle for the ages.  New characters have been added; this time the desert tribesmen are not protecting the mummy himself, but reather the rest of the world from him by keeping the city where he's buried a secret.

Great special effects, some lovely desert scenery, and a great deal of hairs-breadth escapes make this a rousing adventure tale instead of a ""horror"" movie, which is exactly what it should've been all along.

This movie was viewed on a purchased DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1462147200,,1157,4.948453608247423

3188402,1,B00004D2X8,"This could have been a great movie. There are a lot of great elements- great setting, great characters, and the story has a lot of potential. Even the casting (with the notable exception of Maria Bello) is excellent; one of the reasons I was compelled to watch the movie is because of the characters developed by the actors in the first two films. Also Jet Li as a villain! Michelle Yeoh! What could go wrong?

Unfortunately everything.

The whole film is sloppy and rushed. By rushed I mean RUSHED. Despite the fantastic premise the filmmakers utterly fail to even interest the audience let alone thrill. No care is taken with advancing the story... With a throwaway line or two we are sped from place to place. Characters accept absolutely extraordinary events with barely a comment. There is no time to comment, off to the next piece of exposition. Even the relationships are rushed! The characters of Alex and the daughter (whose name I literally did not catch) exchange about 3 lines of dialogue before she's happy to sacrifice IMMORTALITY for him. Rick is dying and Evy, his one true love, can barely work up an anguished grimace before they've crossed the mountains, found Shangri La, and restored him from the very edge of oblivion. There is Zero suspense, Zero mystery and Zero plot. It's like the writers decided since we've seen the first and second movies they didn't have to bother with any cohesive story- they would just throw some action sequences and CGI at us and we'd be thrilled. Look! Yeti! Amazing!

Apparently the filmmakers never learned the difference between story and plot.

This is a somewhat finer point, but it bothered me... There is absolutely no logic the use of the various languages- at one point the character of Zi Yuan raises an army of the dead using an ancient Chinese curse in ENGLISH. Evy, who is supposed to be an expert in Ancient Egypt, can magically read Ancient Chinese, but the 2,000 years dead mummy speaks perfect modern Mandarin. Don't get me started with the Brittish vs American accents. I'm trying to suspend disbelief over here and the inconsistency of it all is maddening.

The dialogue is inane. The characters deliver the corniest and cheesiest of lines with total conviction, except Maria Bello, who could not be more wooden. (She and Brendan Fraser have ZERO chemistry) I started really disliking the characters I had loved in the first two films. No care is taken with new character development. I don't know or care with their personal desires may be. It's all about the surface conflict- raise the mummy, kill the mummy. There is no depth.

If you enjoyed the first two films and care at all about the characters in them then my recommendation is to leave this one in the box.",1459123200,,2739,4.75578947368421

And one reviewer thought Brendan Fraser was an American, and more than one looked to the son as a John Wayne walk-on.

3188514,5,B00004D2X8,"I love to revisit this film. Perhaps, this is the best film created in the adventure genre in the late 90-ies. If you analyze the plot, in its basis it is nothing new. But the makers of this film managed to put on screen, vivid and fascinating story about of the treasure hunters. Each of them had heard about the treasures of the Pharaoh. Each of the members of the expedition had the chance to find these treasures and become immensely rich. But here's the thing! Initially, these treasures are cursed by the Pharaoh and his mummy ready to stand on guard to protect his tomb. It seems that this warning enough not to indulge in such speculations. But isn't the risk of death stops the heroes of this film? No. They embrace the idea in whatever was to find and seize the treasure of the Pharaoh. Even at the cost of his own life.

It is somewhat entertaining and it has its originality from the change of region (China instead of Ancient Egypt, calling to prolongate the saga with mummies all around the globe) but it stays very unremarkable due to a non exciting directing and no interest in the new characters that are brought. The story of the son of Jonathan and his girlfriend is really basic, Maria Bello does not manage to be a good replacer of Rachel Weisz and the Mummy of Jet Li is too much of a moster instead of a real character.",1425081600,,613,4.433628318584071

3188591,5,B00004D2X8,"I will keep this brief as this is the blu-ray release of a 1998 movie.  If you have not yet seen The Mummy, you are in for a treat.  Brendan Frasier plays the part of Rick O'Connell and he helps the beautiful and intriguing Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, and her brother to find the Lost City of Hamunaptra.  Along the way they encounter the deadly and mysterious Medjai, and the sniveling, insidious Benny, Rick's former friend.  Together, Rick and Evelyn must overcome the deadly traps of the Mummy's tomb to find treasures untold, or grisly death...

The Blu-Ray transfer of this movie is fine.  Perhaps my DVD copy was just that good, but I didn't notice a difference between the two formats.  This is by no means a bad thing.  The picture is crisp and clear and the audio is as good as ever.  This movie has a great blend of action, comedy, and tension and is satisfying from start to finish.",1423872000,,898,4.460122699386503

3188593,3,B00004D2X8,"2008's ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" moves the Mummy franchise to China and the year 1947. Rick and Evie O'Connell's grown son Alex (Luke Ford) is excavating the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, an evil would-be ruler of China. The Emperor (Jet Li) and his army have been frozen in time by the curse of an ancient witch (Michelle Yeoh).

Back in England, Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Maria Bello in for Rachel Weitz) are bored with their post-war retirement and ripe for an assignment to return a rare gem to a Shanghai Museum. Once in Shanghai, they drop in on Evie's brother Jonathan (reprised by John Hanna), who is running a bar and trying vainly to keep Alex out of trouble. A fractious family reunion leads to a trip to the museum to see the coffin of the Dragon Emperor. An ambush set by Alex's unscrupulous digging partner and a renegade Chinese general releases the Dragon Emperor, and the chase is on (again).

The movie does not lack for action, although too much of the plot struggles to recapture the magic of the first two Mummy movies. The O'Connells pursue the Dragon Emperor from the streets of Shanghai through the Himalayas to the gates of the mythical Shangri-La, and finally to his Tomb. They will be assisted by an audacious Irish pilot, an immortal witch and her daughter, Yetis, and an army of the Dragon Emperor's victims. Along the way, Rick will bond with his son, and he and Evie will rediscover the thrills of two-fisted, gun-toting archeology.

The CGI effects are impressive, if overdone, while the action sequences practically tumble over each other. This viewer wishes more screen time had been devoted to solving archeological riddles. Maria Bello is adequate as Evie but she and Fraser just don't have the same chemistry. Luke Ford looks a bit old for his role, while the hilarious John Hanna doesn't get nearly enough screen time.

""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" recycles the familiar elements of the first two movies in a new and exotic location.  New viewers may find it interesting; fans of the first  two Mummy movies perhaps less so.",1423526400,,2091,4.730769230769231

Maria Bello isn't a bad actress at all; she's simply not a good Evy. Nevertheless, I still liked it. The setting was different, and many of the characters are different as well, so I suppose it was a nice change. And of course, since this was done years after the last one, the effects in this movie are a lot better as well.

Despite that, I still don't think this is as nice as the prequels. Too bad. :( Alex and Lin made such a cute combo! Haha.",1415232000,,598,4.067796610169491

So for years I refused to watch it...until recently. One very early morning when my bladder woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep after using the restroom I found it on amazon instant video and decided to watch.

This is NOT the Evie and Rick we fell in love with, they completely obliterated the personalities that were already established, especially Evie. The relationship between the two completely fell flat there's no chemistry what so ever between Brendan and Maria. Speaking of...it was like Maria had never acted before. Her performance in this movie is excruciatingly painful. The jokes were juvenile and misplaced. There was one line...one out of the whole movie that felt like these were the same characters. Rick O'Connell says ""Do the words 'rest' and 'peace' mean anything to you two?""

It was every bit as disappointing as I thought it would be.",1410739200,,1119,4.618090452261306

3188670,3,B00004D2X8,"That eccentric family of adventurers lead by Brendan Fraser is back for a third go in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  I love the 1999's The Mummy, considering it one of the better action/adventure films of the last two decades.  I fell in love with the charm of cast and wanted to see more high adventure from them.  The Mummy Returns featured the same creative talent in front of and behind the camera it just felt like a weak retread of the first film.  Does this third entry return the franchise to form?  In short: no, but there's still entertainment to be found in Rick O'Connell's final fight with the undead.

 Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and the cast of supporting characters remain the best element of the franchise coming into this 2008 film.  There's some good interaction between him and his now adult son (Luke Ford) and Jonathan (John Hannah) returns as the series' comic relief.  Jet Li also makes a formidable baddie when he's actually on screen (unfortunately he seems have only been on set for less than a week and it shows by his limited screen time).

Unfortunately the script doesn't give much for these characters to do other than retread plot points from the first two films.  Really the only things new here are the Chinese setting and a brief appearance by some helpful Yetis.  The rest we've all seen before and it was done better in the previous film.

The action scenes are at times entertaining, if not particularly original.  Where they can become trying is when slow-mo decides to rear its ugly head.  This ugly aspect of the film appears whenever our characters begin fighting hand-to-hand and it just doesn't work.  This slow-mo is less Matrix bullet time and more of an artificial slow-mo option one might find in a friend's home movie.  It is just painfully obvious that the shots weren't shot with high speed cameras and were artificially slowed down in post production.

Perhaps the greatest flaw of 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' is that its antagonist feels like a step down.  Jet Li's Dragon Emperor seems to pale in comparison to Imhotep in the first two films.  While the Emperor's ability to throw fire, control ice, and transform into a three-headed dragon and ogre those powers just don't seem to hold a candle to Imhotep's.  As a result it's hard not to feel that the stakes have been lowered between films.

All and all I don't regret seeing this film even if there were many disappointing elements.  I just enjoy these characters' chemistry together and was able to look past many faults because of that.  If you're in that same boat than Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is certainly worth a rental.",1409788800,,2663,4.689655172413793

Simply put, remove Jonathan (the John Hannah character and this film gets 4 stars easily from me and so would the previous two. Jonathan's continuous knack for getting into trouble and make the wrong choices really ruins my chance to fully enjoy this movie. I do like the Brendan Fraser character as the reluctant tomb raider and I am a life long Jet Li fan. What I like most about these films is the various action sequences and varying weapons. I also like the character development of Brendan Fraser and his future possibilities.

3188690,5,B00004D2X8,"I didn't watch this for a long time because the second one in the franchise left such a bad taste in my mouth.  Loved the first one, as I'm a lover of '30s-style adventure flicks and I thought it actually out-raidered the Indiana Jones films, but the second one eschewed all the great character interaction of its prequel and replaced it with non-stop mindless and ultimately pointless action.  So, when I finally found this in the bargain bin at Walmart, I happened to be in the mood, so I picked it up.

This one is much better than the second, though still not as good as the original, but then again, I didn't expect lightning to strike twice.  This movie falls squarely between the original and the second installment in terms of fun.  It seems to have got a lot of bad reviews and I frankly don't know why.  It's still a lot of fun.  I think one problem a lot of viewers had was the absence of Rachel Weiss, but if she didn't want to be in it, there was nothing the filmmakers could do, I suppose.  Her replacement is a very different kind of actress, but, wisely, they wrote the part for her acting style instead of trying to force her into Weiss' shoes.  The scene where she swordfights imaginary assailants in her study is something I just can't imagine Weiss doing with any conviction.  It's entertaining if you watch it for what it is.",1407628800,,1346,4.412955465587045

Spoiler-free!

The film itself is somewhat removed from the first 2 'Mummy' films, which I attribute to the face that it isn't Rachel Weisz. There are a couple moments in the film where I actually thought, ""Well, this franchise just 'jumped the shark,'"" which is too bad, I really enjoyed the first two. Minus those moments, and you'll know them when you see them, the film would be a decent third. But coupled with the absence of Ms. Weisz, it's just too much.

Still, it's a fun(ish) addition to the collection and a good popcorn muncher.",1398470400,,601,4.555555555555555
3188730,3,B00004D2X8,I enjoyed this lighthearted remake of the classic B&W movies when it was released in the theaters. I know that there are plenty of mistakes and that the producers were rather creative with Egyptian history. I believe though that this is escapist entertainment and enjoy watching it with my daughters who get a laugh at some of the antics of the characters.,1397952000,,356,4.758064516129032

3188734,5,B00004D2X8,I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters (on Mother's day) back when I was a little kid but now after all these years......? I shouldn't have been worried! It still holds up to be a great action/horror romp. The dialogue is funny and the action and special effects are stil better than the awful sequels. This is a great remake and it looks great on Blu-ray.,1396137600,,362,4.260869565217392
3188735,5,B00004D2X8,"As far as films made for pure entertainement go this is one of the best. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

In Thebes, Egypt, 1,290 BC, high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a handsome man well versed in the arts of occult and black magic, engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez, sculptural), the favourite concubine of Pharaoh Seti I. When the affair was discovered, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch but when Seti's guards arrived, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun killed herself. In her last words she implored Imhotep to bring her back to life with his dark magic... Those are the first two minutes and about the rest I will just say that quite fast after this introduction we are transported to Egypt in Year of Grace 1926 and then the film really begins.

This film is based on a gallery of mostly endearing or amusing characters, fast moving action and clever, witty dialogs. The main male character is an American adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), about whom we just know that he used to serve in French Foreign legion and that he is currently rotting in an Egyptian jail awaiting his execution. The main female character is Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), a young British lady currently working as librarian but who is also an amateur Egyptologist.

Important secondary characters are:

- Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah), Evelyn's brother, a kind of ne'er-do-well guy and the black sheep of his family
- Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor), a shady slimy character, a former subaltern of O'Connell before his desertion from French Foreign Legion
- Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr, impressive), a mysterious Arab warrior
- Terrance Bay (Erick Avari), Egyptologist and Library supervisor, Evelyn's boss
- Gad Hassan (Omid Djalili), the warden of Egyptian prison and man in charge of O'Connell's execution
- Mr Burns, Mr Henderson and Mr Daniels, three American adventurers,
- Dr Allen Chamberlain, a British scientist who travels with the three American adventurers
- also lots of camels and flesh eating scarabs...)))

This film very desservedly earned a great reputation and also a gazillion of dollars when released in 1999 and of course was unavoidably followed by two very, very bad sequels.

This is of course pure entertainment but it is very well done pure entertainment and the result is a funny, even merry, fast paced adventure film which can be easily watched in family (no strong language, not too scary) - rating it ""15"" is really an exaggeration. A film which can be watched numerous times and therefore worth purchasing. In one word - this film is JUICY...))) Enjoy!",1395964800,,2641,5.045871559633028
3188736,4,B00004D2X8,I recently purchased the Mummy series because it's a trilogy that is great fun.  There's a lot of action sequences with great special effects and there is an interesting plot with comedic tie-ins.  I thought I had the series in my collection but apparently I didn't.  I was happy to purchase this series.,1395964800,,304,4.69811320754717
3188737,5,B00004D2X8,"This goes to show that when they want to.

Thanks Universal.
And Good Job.!!!!!!!!!!",1395792000,,242,5.075
3188738,5,B00004D2X8,This was so funny and I love to watch it. It was sent right away and was advertised truthfully  and was sent on time.,1395619200,,117,3.875
3188739,2,B00004D2X8,"What made the Mummy work as a franchise was the character development and the chemistry the cast members had with each other.  Without Rachael Weisz and Oded Fehr (whose character would not have fit into this story anyway), the movie is not the same and ultimately does not work well at all.

This time the movie is set in 1946, in China and the Mummy is played by the awesome Jet Li.  In fact the only reason I give this even 2 stars is because of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh.  They both did a great job with their characters, and the cinematography and visual effects are great,  however there is a total lack of continuity from the rest of the story.  First you are expected to believe that Brendan Fraser has aged 26 years from the first movie without looking much older.  The kid Alex from the second movie is now grown up and has lost the British accent in favor of an American one, and is very little like how he was portrayed in the second movie.  And John Hannah is given little, if nothing, to do in this movie, and it just seems like his character is there to tag along.  I think the decision to recast the character of Evie was horrible, and they would have better off to had killed the character off than bring someone new in.  Even though I do not think Bello was horrible in the role, it just did not have the same feel as with how Weisz played her.

As far as extras go on the disc version, there are few deleted and extended scenes and a 20 min making of feature, a commentary track on the film itself and a handful of other items.  Not as much as on the first two discs, but not bad for what is there.  As I said above it was really a movie that did not have to be made.  I think the producers thought they had a much stronger franchise with the Mummy than they really did and without without all of the original cast, which they did get for The Mummy Returns, it just fell very flat.  Luckily it seems that they got that message however since no other attempts at continuing the franchise have been made.",1395532800,,2020,4.196891191709844
3188740,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a retelling of the 1930s version of the story.  It utilizes many of the same characters and story elements, but it is its own movie.  It is not a shot-by-shot remake by any means.  This version utilizes a ton of CGI animation and green screen.  It is set in the period between World War I and II, and so it blends ancient Egypt with the 1920s modern world using the technology of late the 1990s early 2000s.  It is not meant to be an accurate period piece from either ancient Egypt or early 1900s Egypt.  So if you are one who would nitpick things that are wrong, you probably want to stay away from this.

The movie itself is a blend of action, comedy and romance.  Along with somewhat cheesy drama.  In some ways it pays homage to the old monster movies, and in some ways it is a tongue in cheek spoof of them.  It has an ensemble cast of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, John Hannah, all of whom do a great job with their respective roles.  Fraser shows he has the chops to be both funny and somewhat of an action hero...Although not necessarily a larger than life one.  Hannah is great at blending being a cowardly, weasel with reluctant bravery when the need arises, so that you actually like and root for his character.  It is hard to buy Weisz as the nerdy librarian they portray her as in the beginning of the move and their attempts to make her kind of frumpy and tone down how gorgeous she really is did not work all that well.  But once they turned the character into more of a leading lady kind of role for movies like this, she worked well.

I thought Vosloo,did a fine job as the mummy, especially given that so much of his performance was based on expression as opposed to dialog.  He said very little throughout the film, and when he did it was never in English,  Regardless of that he was able to portray being menacing, smug, concerned and scared without needing to say much.

If you get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds very good.  Again the special effects are now 15 years old so some of the things are not going to be as good as in a movie made today would be.  However, it looks about as good as a movie from that time could.  There are quite a few special features, with the longest being a 50min centered on the digital effects used to create the various mummies in the movie.  There are also some deleted and extended scenes and a couple short making of features.

Do not go into this movie thinking you are about to see an academy award winning best picture or get a best actor/actress performance.  You won't.  It is purely a big budget, special effects popcorn movie.  If you look at it as a somewhat funny action/adventure movie, and if you generally like those kinds of movies then you will probably like this.",1395446400,,2773,4.325581395348837

In addition to a week fighting scene between two great legends (Yeo and Li), the story line was simply weak.  I also felt that without Rachel Weiz, the character of Evey/Evalyn didn't quite deliver.  Just a bit too cheesy for me.  But I should have known, the third installment usually is. On the bright side, the CGI is better than the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns.

3188773,1,B00004D2X8,They literally took everything about the characters from the first movies and completely made them behave and be the opposite all the sudden. AS IF Evelyn would ever have become a romance novel writer?! That couple never would have become boring and staying at home every night but for some reason this movie makes it out to seem that their whole life turned into them being boring and normal and not adventurers. They aren't true to the original characters AT ALL. Seriously so sad to see a movie chain I loved so much turned into total crap. They couldn't even find an actress to replace Weiss that was any good!! They acted like this horrible woman was Evelyn when she is everything the character we all loved wasn't. They could have at least said she died and he re-married!! I don't blame Rachel Weiss for not doing this film because the character she portrayed was just ruined in this film. I could watch the first two movies over and over again over the years and would LOVE more of them with the original cast back.

3188778,5,B00004D2X8,"""I . . . am . . . a Librarian"" the line delivered by Rachel Weisz is only one very small but very memorable moment that becomes reason to love this movie. Ms. Weisz's performance was perfect and so damn charming, it was largely the reason I became so smitten with this movie. Brendan Fraser was just as wonderful and his performance gives this script the one two punch that makes a film into a MOVIE. These two great actors seemed like they were made for each other here, and that is what drew me in.
The rest of the cast (good guys and evil bad guys) was equally superb, the costumes, the music, the pace was great -- leaving you with the though of, ""What just happened to the last two hours?""

Not to mention the flawless special effects done almost 20 years ago qre still holding up better than modern films barring very few. And they look gorgeous. When you first see Imhotep's mummy form it is beyond jaw-dropping to the point where James Cameron and his Na'vi are hulk green with jealousy.

Lastly the sound mix is an awesome DTS-HD track that even on my less than stellar soumd system makes my house shake without the sound 3itself even being slightly distorted.

And lastly all the special features included are the same as the collector's edition I've had since 1999-2000. They aren't in HD but hey, it's not really a big deal.

3188801,2,B00004D2X8,"Vampires were hot a few years back, and zombies are hot right now. So I have to wonder if mummies will eventually get their day.

Until they get around to making a movie about a sexy teen mummy, the best example would probably be ""The Mummy,"" which adds a gruesome twist to the mummy-in-love brand of Hammer Horror. Lots of CGI, lots of over-the-top action, lots of teeth-grindingly annoying comedy, and Brendan Fraser back before he became kind of doughy and creepy looking.

Over three thousand years ago, the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) killed the pharoah when the pharoah discovered Imhotep's affair with his mistress. When Imhotep tried to resurrect his lover, he was captured and condemned to a horrifying slow death.

In the 1920s, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) is given an ancient box and map that shows the way to Hamunaptra, the ancient city of the dead. After she saves the man who had it, Rick O'Connell (Fraser), from nearly being executed, they set out on an expedition to Hamunaptra -- and quickly discover that they'll have to compete with a larger American team of archaeologists.

But when Evelyn reads a passage from The Book of the Dead, Imhotep rises from the dead -- and he begins absorbing parts and fluids from the treasure hunters to restore his body. He also unleashes the Plagues of Egypt on the nearby city. But once he's returned fully to life, Imhotep is determined to finish resurrecting his beloved, and he plans to sacrifice Evelyn's body to do it.

It's easy to understand why ""The Mummy"" is a guilty pleasure for so many people -- it feels like Stephen Sommers concocted this movie in a lab, using equal parts Hammer Horror and Indiana Jones. It feels like a movie entirely made to inspire amusement-park rides. And that's okay -- everybody needs some fun movies where you just turn your brain off and enjoy.

It has a pretty simple plot -- the heroes go to Hamunaptra, wake the mummy, and spend the rest of the film trying to kill him. Along the way we have a fairly chaste romance and lots of adventure (crashing planes, swarms of scarabs, plenty of guns), with giant swathes of CGI. And yes, it gets disgusting at times -- think scarabs crawling into people's brains, or a person who loses his eyes and tongue to Imhotep.

But honestly, it's not a very good movie. It was apparently written by someone whose only knowledge of ancient Egypt comes from the Book of Exodus. Seriously, why is the Book of the Dead a CODEX, which wasn't invented until centuries later? Why is the city assaulted by the Biblical plagues? None of it makes sense, especially since the Biblical plagues weren't from the Egyptian religion, and they occurred YEARS after Imhotep's demise!

And despite the simplicity of the plot, Sommers manages to leave giant holes in the story. For instance, Imhotep is established to be terrified of cats, who are the guardians of the underworld. Fine, sounds plausible... except that this weakness is used against him for a grand total of two seconds, then forgotten.

It also has -- God help us -- comic relief. Too much. A few one-liners would have been fine, but Sommers crams in entire scenes (Evelyn teetering on a ladder before toppling bookcases like dominoes) in an attempt to make the audience laugh. Usually they are both too long and not as funny as he thinks. The worst comic relief is Beni, an obnoxious little weasel whose entire schtick is that... he's an obnoxious little weasel. He makes Jar Jar Binks look hilarious.

I admit to never having understood the appeal of Brendan Fraser, even when he was considered hot. Here, he feels like a G-rated Indiana Jones, minus the stubble and sweat -- a passable roguish hero, but nothing particularly special. Rachel Weisz is the real revelation here -- despite a standard gutsy ingenue role, she really has an aura of intelligence and elegance about her, as well as a feeling of strength. And there are some decent performances by Oded Fehr, Erick Avari and Jonathan Hyde.

""The Mummy"" is best appreciated as brain candy -- because when you stop and think about it, your brain starts to hurt. And I pray that Stephen Sommers never, ever makes a comedy.",1380067200,,4169,4.736551724137931

There is a spiritual element to this movie that also makes it intriguing, like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Now I don't think it's as good as Raiders, but it isn't as bad as King Solomon's Mines either.

This is how the story goes: Explorer Rick O'Connell to combat the resurrected Han Emperor in an epic that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Rick is joined in this all-new adventure by son Alex, wife Evelyn and her brother, Jonathan. And this time, the O'Connells must stop a mummy awoken from a 2,000-year-old curse who threatens to plunge the world into his merciless, unending service. Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor and his 10,000 warriors have laid forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. But when dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, the reckless young archaeologist must seek the help of the only people who know more than he does about taking down the undead: his parents. As the monarch roars back to life, our heroes find his quest for world domination has only intensified over the millennia. Striding the Far East with unimaginable supernatural powers, the Emperor Mummy will rouse his legion as an unstoppable, otherworldly force... unless the O'Connells can stop him first.

The production design by Nigel Phelps (who also did the production design to the upcoming ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"", ""The Island"" (2005) & ""Troy"" (2004) is great!

3188835,3,B00004D2X8,"Missed the original Evy.  Probably the reason for most of the negative reviews.  Moving on to China and the first Emperor was logical, since seeing a third reincarnation of Imhotep would have been even a greater stretch and a bit ho-hum.  Don't understand why it was necessary to place the period in 1949 at the time of the Chinese civil war, unless it was to create another love interest focal point between the son and the witch's immortal daughter.  The biggest suspension of belief was how General Ming could have ever been loyal to a narcissistic tyrant as Han.  But otherwise entertaining and enough attention to archaeolgical detail to pass muster.  OK, I'm a Qin Shi Huang/Qin Dynasty ""fan"" and find it a fascinating period of China's history. I can see the first Emperor being an egotistical, sadistic tyrant, intent on conquering the known world.  However, I'm still waiting for a story line that would reference the supposed curse that ""in whatsoever dynasty my tomb is desecrated, that dynasty will fall"" - the main plot line would be that of the Chinese communist party putting everything in the way of opening the emperor's tomb, and an archaeologist seeking the ultimate historical dig inadvertantly destroying a dynasty. Probably implausible, since the Chinese government would need to grant access to any dig, and that isn't likely.  But a movie can go there.  Nor likely that permission would be granted to film in China.  Any takers?  (Note: Case in point, to date, there has been no attempt under the current regime to enter the Emperor's final resting place. They have confined themselves to the periphery of the site.)",1366934400,,1640,4.927272727272728

The film Is Very entertaining in an un-scary way which is the whole point of the Film to be Effing Scary. Instead the Director Makes an Indiana jones type movie In a Friggin Horror film. I understand why he did it The Mummy doesn't really register for most people as scary. Brendan Frasiers'  wicked performance as Badass Rick O Connell is what saves this movie. He is most likable as a blend  of Han Solo with Indiana Jones. He plays a scoundrel on a treasure hunt. the movies Plot is fun but ultimately there is nothing you have not seen before in scarier films. what I like about this Film is that there is a lot of Action with Brendan Frasier playing a complete badass. the movie is not exactly good but it is not a bad film either.

3188894,4,B00004D2X8,"There's a bizarre dissconnect and hatred people seem to have with this third entry in ""The Mummy"" franchise.  Whereas on the whole, people loved the first two films, there's been an almost inexplicable backlash against this third entry in the series.  And I never understood it.  I saw it with my whole family in theaters before reading any critical or fan reviews and we all enjoyed it.  I watched it with several friends, including one who absolutely hated the second movie, and they all enjoyed it.  In fact, everyone I know outside of the internet...  Well, they all enjoyed it.  Even the hard-to-please people.  It's an enjoyable adventure-romp with a cheesy story, some cool special effects, and some very decent action sequences.  It's the same darned type of film as the first two, so it makes no sense to me why it's supposedly so much worse than the prior films.

The story is simple- Rick and Evy go to meet their son, whom has unearthed the petrified Dragon Emperor in China.  When a paramilitary group orchestrates his revival, Rick, Evy, Alex, Jonathan and their new sidekick Lin must follow and stop him from regaining his power raising his army to enslave all of mankind.

It's big, loud, stupid and a lot of fun.  Just like the first two.  Face it, people.  The first two weren't high art.  They were big, loud, dumb, fun movies.

Sure, I can nit-pick details.  I wish Rachel Weiz had returned.  I wish Stephen Sommers had directed.  But fundamentally, this isn't any worse than the other movies.  I'd even argue that it's superior to the second film, because that one was all over the place with the story and had far more visual effects just for the sake of visual effects, whereas this one is more direct and concise in terms of plot, and has far less visual effects.

The DVD/Blu-Ray also has a nice assortment of special features, with commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and some deleted scenes.  (I don't know too much about the Blu-Ray exclusive features, as I don't tend to pay attention to the U-Control features.)

All-in-all, this movie doesn't deserve the terrible reputation it has, and for open-minded fans, it's worth owning.",1353888000,,2160,4.791327913279133

3188903,3,B00004D2X8,"But it could have been so much better.

The strongest part of the story, for me, was at the very beginning during the set up for the rest of the movie. Russell Wong and Michelle Yeoh had such wonderful chemistry together and they were only on screen for the first five or so minutes. I really wish it could have been longer.

Brendan Fraser turned in another solid outing as Rick O'Connell, but John Hannah's Jonathan lacked heart; he was almost a caricature. The grown up Alex with an American accent and the non-Brit Maria Bello portraying Evie, using a very uneven British accent, were the weakest parts in this movie.

I wish the screen writers had let Alex age naturally, using Freddie Boath again and written a script that wouldn't have forced Rachel Weisz to back out.

All in all the movie was worth two stars, but Russell Wong and Michelle Yeoh's chemistry earned it a third.

I would strongly suggest renting this movie first, not buying, so you can decide for yourself if it's worth owning.",1342396800,,1001,4.601123595505618

I didn't quite buy the change of wife from the previous movies but the actress was fine.  I know they can't always get the same people. This was a little more fun, more lighthearted, than the second movie which we also liked, and it seemed a little shorter, which we liked A LOT.

Firstly, I am not into fiction movies a lot, I enjoy hardcore dramas and gore/thriller/horror genre a lot, but 'The Mummy' is exceptional, trust me. Right from the beginning you get involved in the rich scenario of ancient eqypt followed by the scenes in which we are introduced to Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. The chemistry between Fraser and Weisz is nothing less than extraordinary, you are easily glued to the couple on screen and what makes the whole atmosphere more delightful is a wonderful performance from John Hannah. Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo deliver terrific performance and the entire cast make a perfect team work to make this film outstanding. There are very rare films who give a decent balance between gore, horror, drama and humor, this film is undoubtedly one of them and hats off to Stephen Sommers for a stunning direction.

The audio is also top notch with Surrounds in all the right places and Jerry Goldsmith's score just booming.  I don't remember this film ever looking so good, especialy in DVD format in that ""Mummy Trilogy"" box set.

The first Mummy I film I bought did not contain any ads. The second one, Mummy II, I could get past the ads by picking ""scene 1"" instead of ""play"", now I have to mute the TV and go occupy myself with other projects.....it takes around 10 minutes before the ads run out and I can actually watch the movie.

That being said, it is not going to completely change your world, but it is one of the best pulpy action films out there. It has some good cheeky comedy, some cool action, and is about a mummy with magical powers and it doesn't really suck. It feels like a modern update of those older pulp films of the 30's and 40's that help capture you and takes you on an adventure. I definitely give it a positive review.",1335571200,,506,4.173469387755102
3188910,4,B00004D2X8,"I bought the Blu-Ray edition of ""The Mummy"" about a year and a half ago, and it is a great disc!

I had already owned a VHS copy of the film and the 2-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD.  The Blu-Ray release essentially includes MOST of the features from the 2-Disc DVD (Although I think some of the text-based special features may have been omitted, but I'm not 100% on that, just don't remember seeing them in the menu), plus a few new featurettes, mainly advertisments for the third film.

The picture quality is very nice.  The image is a lot sharper, and some of the effects look more detailed and lifelike.  (Particularly the opening shot of the Sphinx being built)  In addition, the desert photography (mainly the gorgeous dunes) benefit dramatically from the sharper image and more vibrant colors.  It honestly looked better to me on this Blu-Ray than I remember it looking in the theater.  Definitely worth the upgrade to Blu-Ray!  Looks a LOT better than the DVD did.

Sound is also great, and sounds a little bit clearer and sharper than the DVD release.

The film itself is also great fun!  A fun adventure with elements of romance and a touch of horror!

Worth buying for fans who are upgrading the DVD collection, or who haven't seen it yet!",1334102400,,1246,4.609090909090909

Not only did I love this film, but it's so easy to watch because Brendan Fraser is such a hottie deluxe! The chemistry between Fraser & Weisz is fantastic.

3188915,5,B00004D2X8,"I really really really liked this movie, THIS is what the second movie should have been like. Some say Brendan Fraser mailed in a lame performance, I disagree. Yes, Rachel Weisz declined to do this movie. My opinion, they should have said she died, and that Brendan's and Maria Bello's character fall in love. There was chemistry there, And I have to say. I enjoyed her a whole lot better than Rachel's interpretation of the character, the cow in the plane scene. Yeah, again could've done without it. But as a whole, Jet-Li is the scariest Mummy. Plus it's set in China, where yes, there are mummies there too. I think the major problem with this movie, is that by the time this movie came out, people had gotten tired of the series. And all they saw was Brendan Fraser as Dudley Doo right, and that's a shame. Because this movie was much much much better than the second one. And to answer a negative reviewer, the o'connells boy is now a tombraider of sorts, kind of like his dad. And as they're tracking the mummy in the mountains, he tells his mother that he's not a virgin. She asks him ""oh really how many"", now some have taken that as to say that she was crazy in a perverse way. But in reality, she was trying to keep her family together. And when she asked that question, it was more of a shocked, and then wanting to find out, to immediatley it's none of my business. I think this movie gets dumped on unfairley, this was a very good movie.",1327708800,,1451,4.357933579335794

WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT!!!!!, this movie delivers in more ways than one. In response to one reviewer, I've seen the original Mummy movie, woooooooooooooow, I had a hard time trying to keep from getting bored. All they did, was update the movie, story and all. This time the Mummy is actually scary, he actually looks like he came back from the dead. And the scarabs, they are a character in this movie all by themselves. Surprise surprise surprise, when you give Brendan Fraser a very good script, and don't ask him to do too much. He's a very good actor, there is chemistry between him and Rachel weisz. The only update on the story, is that instead on Imhotep falling in love with A queen named Anucksananum, it's the pharoe's mistress. I won't rehash the plot, I like the fact that Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'connell as a man of action. It's not even close to boring, I enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well directed, and very well acted.",1327708800,,1058,4.458762886597938

The acting wasn't horrible but Maria Bello (Whom I normally like) wasn't the right fit to play the part, I like everyone else was disappointed Rachel didn't come back but even so I feel like Maria didn't do the part right sadly but Maria wasn't the reason this movie was bad, the story line and plot cause have been better, the action scenes weren't that great or special effects and it takes way to long for the movie to get started not to mention after things start happening its still boring. Bottom line this movie should have gone straight to video or better yet never should have been made, Its completely predictable as well and don't get me started on how much of a bad idea the yetis or bigfoots were lol catch it on tv or rent it for a dollar but that about all its worth and if your watching cause your bored beware you'll only be more bored by the end and if you weren't bored then im sorry that you will be by the end.

Would advise anyone who likes horror movies to grab this one and when it arrives, microwave some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy it.

The acting is awesome (despite the loss of Rachel Weisz), it has bravura set pieces, quotable dialog, great special effects, cool stunts, lots of clever humor and jokes and an amazing film score by Randy Edelman . Almost a perfect movie in every sense. It's a non-stop action packed adventure, and that is my favorite kind of movie. I enjoy the other films in the Mummy trilogy, but for some reason, this one has always been my favorite, regardless to what people say about it. My favorite scenes from the movie are the battle at the end, and the battle in the Himalayas. There both really cool, and have some really cool uses of special effects. I also loved when the emperor transformed in to various beasts / monsters (3 headed dragon, giant horned creature, etc.). Some of my favorite lines from the film were: ""Welcome to the twentieth century!"" and ""Enough tricks! where's your honor? fight like a man!"" I've watched this movie countless times growing up and it never fails to enthrall and entertain me.

Great special effects, not a bad plot, and decent acting make this enjoyable to watch.  Rachel Weisz selected not to be in this movie, her replacement Maria Bello does a good job as the wife of Brenden Fraser in the movie.

What makes this movie different are the outstanding special effects, good acting, and great action.  Brendon Fraser is the hero, Rachel Weisz is the love interest and Arnold Vosloo is ""IMHOTEP"" the Mummy!!

3188932,3,B00004D2X8,"I just recently picked up ""The Mummy"" Trilogy on Blu-Ray.  I barely remember the first two films but I do remember that I thought that they were pretty good.  And after reading all those negative reviews of the third film, this ""Tomb of The Dragon Emperor"", I decided to watch it first before I watch the more popular two.

And, I'd have to say that it's not so terrible.  As it's own film, it's just as good as any Indiana Jones film, in fact, I think this one film is better than Indiana Jone's Last Crusade and especially the last Indiana Jones film of ""Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" since this theme seems to be rather similar.

So, I'm glad I watched this episode of ""The Mummy"" first, because I haven't allowed my opinion to be tainted by expecting a plausible extension of the appeal of the first two.  I'll wait a week or so, then I'll watch the first two with unperceived, unbiased, un-predetermined, expectations.",1313884800,,923,4.530120481927711

I took into consideration I was over anticipating a great sequel after the first two movies and might have expected too much after all the hype. But this movie truly stinks! Screwed the pooch with the plot and should have stayed with the successful formula of the first two. It reeks from lackluster to boring performances by all involved. David Calder who gets his head cut off actually deserves it in this one. A wonderful classically trained actor reminiscent of a Sydney Greenstreet couldn't even help this script! Throw into the mix a crappy soundtrack, lousy chemistry, horrible camera work jumping all over the place back and forth straining ones eyeballs, blurry images and undefined closeups. Dark lighting throughout. Special effects were a cross between Touchstone's Who Framed Roger Rabbit,and Tim Burton's Batman. Too bad this movie couldn't hold a candle to either one of them. Sorry Brendan I needed a gas mask to even view your performance that I have genuinely enjoyed in just about all your prior works up until this one. Your Replacement wife looks more like she should have played your mother and had me yawning more then a 42 hour after the party  hang over with no sleep.

3188934,4,B00004D2X8,"As a fan of the first two Mummy movies as well as the take off the ""Scorpion King"" there is a sense of let down but the 3rd in the Mummy series is not all that bad.  However, I would have preferred the movie to be shot in the area of the first two Mummy's but archeologists do travel from one ancient site to another.  To me, what has caused the most disappointments, is the extreme relocation from dessert to snow and ice.  If there were not two prior Mummy films and the 3rd in the series was the first Mummy, it would have been much more accepted.  Squeals always suffer the dogma of not being as good as its predecessor and the 3rd Mummy movie is no exception.  So, if you are able to dismiss the 3rd Mummy from the first two films, you will enjoy the movie.  Also, the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor's special affects are as good as the original Mummy flicks. I do not know where the theory that the special affects were poor could be rooted.  The special affects, for their geographical location, were excellent. Best advice: Rent it and then watch it.

Then later,Evelyn is talking about the process of mummification, and she says ""...and then they take out your heart."" (which they would leave in). And there were five canopic jars when there should have been four. The list goes on.

Next, slapstick fly fishing!?  (This is where they lost me.)
Then, the introduction of a new actress playing Evelyn O'Connell (in an entirely different manner than the original actress, Rachel Weisz).  Eh, I've seen better....Rachel Weisz!
And!  Alex O'Connell is now all grown up (without his British accent).  He's a bit of a dope; his parents have become stuffy and boring.  The ne'er-do-well uncle/brother has been relegated to comic relief and a constant annoyance.  The family melodrama is tedious and dull.  It takes forever before something even remotely exciting takes place (too little too late).  The dialog is corny (""we've got to put this mummy down fast!"").  I'd rather they did something with the dialog instead!  This was a poor excuse to revive a series that should have stayed put the way it was (loved the first movie, tolerated the second).

3188943,3,B00004D2X8,"To start off, I never even knew there was a third movie of this series.  Until last week I saw it at our library.  At first I was excited for another one because I enjoyed the first two.  Then I realized, why have I not heard of this?

Low and behold, three days later I had the chance to watch it and completely understood why I had never seen or heard of this flick.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not terrible...but it's certainly not good either.  This movie seems like it was made more for the actors to enjoy another mummy escapade than for the viewer.

Jonathan is still the self-centered, in-it-for-the-riches kind of guy, only enhanced with a few one-liners that you could only expect him to say. Evy is a completely different actress, which takes a leap away from the originals and it shows.  Smart career choice for original Evy.  Alex looked a lot older than he should have, but seemed to have the character's mindset.  Rick's role is portrayed alright, but Brenden Frasier just doesn't seem as into it.  None of these main characters stay in character very well through the whole movie.

I did however very much enjoy Michelle Yeoh in the film though and wish she could have been a bigger part of it!  Isabella Leong was a different pace too and helped tye the two time settings together.

The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a completely different realm of mummy movies, and not nearly as powerful.  There are some amusing son/father gun scenes.  Never thought I would see Yetis, though you just have to love them.  There are a few ""are you serious"" and ""did they really just do/say that"" that really takes you out of movie land, but if you want something for listening to in the background or a little different from the first two, this has it's little ""ha ha""s throughout the show.

But I found it to definitely be a better film than many reviewers made it out to be. There's fun action, Fraser is always likable and charming, and the movie moves along at a nice pace.

One thing I have to say is that, even though the movie is called The Mummy, and the villain is often referred to like that, he's not. He is a corpse, it's true. And there are plenty of other fighting corpses. But a mummy has very specific rules for what makes it a mummy. That being said, it's only really a minor thing. There's still plenty of other fun to be had and they couldn't very well change the name of this entry in the series to be ""The Strangely Active Dead Guy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"". The series is called The Mummy, so that's what they had to use.

Still, it's not up to the same level as the first two, but I found it more enjoyable than The Scorpion King. Take that for what it's worth.",1296864000,,998,4.060913705583756

This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.
That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating. But beyond that, there is very little here that is particularly objectionable.

3188952,4,B00004D2X8,"Set several years later than the second Mummy movie, ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" gives us exciting action sequences and fights, along with an interesting battle between two reanimated forces to top things off. Maria Bello takes over the role of Evie, Rick's love and wife, and I think may have better chemistry with Brendan Fraser (at least in the stage of long time married couple), than Rachel Weisz did. I very much liked Rachel in the role in the first two movies, but her agent reportedly said of this one that ""Rachel will NEVER play the role of the mother of a grown son!"" I personally think that was a mistake, as film today is full of mature female characters in exciting and sexy roles. That attitude was more at home in the 1940s than in the 21st century. Maria Bello is charming and believable in the role, and with her performance I quickly forgot that it wasn't Rachel Weisz ... probably a second reason why it was a bad idea for Rachel to turn down a blockbuster role ... for what?

Brendan Fraser is his normal mummy-slaying self. There is nothing new from him in this role, but if you enjoyed the first two films, you really need nothing new from him in this one. He is heroic and entertaining in the role, and that's what we were looking for here.

Luke Ford is competent and exciting as the now grown son, Alex. He and Isabella Leong develop a believable chemistry after a rocky start to their relationship.

Here we have an ancient Chinese Emperor coming back to life, with the immediate goal of restoring his army along with him so that he may rule the world. I think that calling him a mummy might have been a bit of a stretch, but he does indeed provide an evil and formidable foe for our heroes to deal with. I found the story to have a few surprising choices, which is rare in an action/adventure/monster story. Cool elements such as yetis battling a modern Chinese army abound, and as mentioned above, the ultimate battle between reanimated CGI armies is both interesting and well rendered.

I understand that there are a lot of fans of the first two movies that found this one lacking. I do agree that the first was the best, as is often the case in a series. However, I think the third installment measures up very well as compared to the second. I look to be entertained by an action film, and I certainly was here. The picture and sound on the Blu-ray is outstanding, which helps a lot all in itself! LOL",1295049600,,2435,4.440715883668904

3188954,2,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor joins movies like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as movies that are slightly enjoyable but should not have been made.

Brendan Fraser returns as the hero, Rick O' Connell who has retired from active duty (mummy hunting).

Jet Li stars as the Dragon Emperor. Wasn't he supposed to be done with films?

The story goes, Rick O'Connell's son is all grown up and following in his parent's footsteps. He's in China digging up dead people when he discovers the Dragon Emperor.

There are the token villains who want to bring the Emperor back to life and the O'Connells have to bring the crazy people back where they came from.

This third film has some special effects that we didn't see in the first two films. This mummy has some crazy abilities. He can turn into a three-headed dragon, some kind of monster cat and he can shoot fire from his hands.

The filmmakers tried to add ""kiddie"" humor in the story and it just made the dialogue worse.

Being on top of all the movies of the last ten years and having seen the first to the last of the festival of special effects all the way up to Avatar and Alice in Wonderland and some of the last pathetic attempts - The Hurt Locker - this Mummy movie has far more going for it and is far better than most of the films that are ""state of the art.""

3188958,3,B00004D2X8,"I loved The Mummy I.  I hated the Mummy 2: Scorpion King - which saw the series descend into theme park ride chicanery.  I wasn't expecting much from The Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor - but I was pleasantly surprised when the film started off strongly with a bang - taking its audience from Ancient China to 20th century Shanghai.

With slam-bang action, sweeping visuals, pace, sharp visuals...Director Rob Cohen does a good job of manning the helm.  This is pretty much saturday matinee theatre pulp fiction for a new generation.

For one thing, this was leaps and bounds better than Indiana Jones 4; Tomb Raider and other adventurer attempts.  To set it in China was definitely inspired as well, although the Chinese people didn't appreciate the liberties taken with their history.

The film gets a little loose later on - as the stakes never quite remain as high as we need them to be for some reason.  You feel like the filmmakers are holding on to the PG version of events as opposed to making it work for both an adult and young audience.  So some hokeyness creeps in dialogue-wise, and that is where the film despite resplendent visual fx - loses its grip.  The characters never quite rise to the fore and the zombie terracotta warriors end up being more Jar Jar Binks than terrifying, so that's another problem.  The Yetis are also overly nimble and friendly  like Wookees on steroids.

Jet Li's character could have certainly been more menacing as well - a wasted opportunity.  He just snarls and gnarls. Several ""what-if"" scenarios start to enter the viewer's mind.  Make me care! was what I was thinking.  But what we get is more fx.

The other criticism is that Brendan Fraser has to share the leading role with his screen son - and he isn't even looking like a dad of a grown man yet.  Maria Bello makes an equitable sideways replacement for Rachel Weisz.

I'd rate this 3.25 to 3.5 stars.  Your kids will like it.  And the adults will like the first half at least.",1286668800,,1985,4.582386363636363

Honestly, if it were possible, I'd have Daniel and his director Rob Cohen sent to jail!  What they have done here drags what's left of film culture into the mud.  These guys are to movies what Madoff is to finance.

3188963,1,B00004D2X8,"For whatever reasons, I truly enjoy the first two movies of this series, so much so that I still watch them rather frequently. They are always the go-to movies if I just feel like watching something to entertain me but nothing around me is tickling my fancy. Fraser and Weisz have amazing chemistry, the plot is exciting, and the side characters are hilarious...not to mention the hot as hell-fire desert man from Deuce Bigelow fame.

So then there was news of the 3rd installment. At this point I was working toward my college degree, but I was just as thrilled as the first time I heard about it. Rejoicing all over the place. Then my little bubble got burst. Rachel Weisz would not be cast as Edie in this movie.

She was offered the role, for sure, but turned it down because of a bad script. I was really upset with this woman at first and then I saw the mistake, I mean movie, which she wisely chose not to touch with a 10 foot pole. What a piece of garbage. Not only did the plot seem completely contrived, it had hardly any continuity from the previous movies. How did Alex go from being a child around 10 to a person who looks to be 30 in the couple of years between these movies? Where did his British accent go and how did it turn into an American one while he was digging around in China? Who is the psychopath that thought replacing Weisz with Maria Bello would be in any way okay? What happened to Edie being Egyptian? For goodness sake, it seems like they didn't even try to pick someone who could hold up that part with any integrity. It just seems like they picked the first available actress who would do it for the cheapest (Maria Bello's career isn't exactly stellar so I'm sure it didn't take much at all to get her on board). Weisz was fiesty and captivating, where Bello is vanilla and honestly just seems lost in the movie. Its like Rob Cohen just wanted to crank out another film as quickly and cheaply as possible, regardless of what effect it would have on the integrity of the product he is pushing. I honestly think that if Fraser's career wasn't in such a slump he would have turned down the role as well (which I would have LOVED so we could just pick up from the 2nd movie when a director with an actual sense of what is good could take on the franchise). But no... now we are stuck trying to work around that disaster of a movie.

What is really sad is that they already have plans for the Mummy 4: Rise of the Aztecs, with 5 and 6 waiting in the wings. Maria Bello (having nothing better to do) has already signed on for all of them. Its a tragedy. Now we all get to sit by and watch Rob Cohen run this franchise into the ground, taking whats left of poor Fraser's career with it. This franchise could have been really great. It would have been the Indiana Jones of my generation...now it will never live up to the potential it once had. Fraser is the only thing left breathing life into these movies, and he is the one who is going to shoulder the blame for the rest of them bombing because he pretty much IS the franchise....its terrible.

The only way it could be saved is this:
Someone, for God's sake, take the reigns from Rob Cohen's hands. Basically pretend like the 3rd movie didn't happen, bring back Weisz, find someone (much younger and better at acting!) who could actually be Rick and Edie's son, and for the love of all things holy stop making Alex the focus of the movie. Rick is the best character, there haven't even been enough movies to start ""passing the torch"" to his kid yet, geez. I mean c'mon Rob Cohen, couldn't you have tried just a little bit? This movie franchise is going to crumble in your fingers, Rob, because you decided it was better to lose one of the MAIN TWO CHARACTERS who CARRIED the movies because you were too cheap and lazy to find better writers, and wanted to make a quicker buck than have a high quality movie which could endure for years to come.

I won't be back to watch any more Mummy movies....after that third one I doubt I'll even bother renting them. I'm happy without wasting a whole two hours of my life. I'll just have to keep watching the first two and hoping that some day, years down the line, some director will realize how much of a mistake this was and re-do the series.

3188966,2,B00004D2X8,"The original ""Mummy"" with Boris Karloff was not so much a horror film (though it had horrific elements) as a drama about a dead Egyptian trying to bring his belov&eacute;d back to life. Karloff's performance is typical of his work, with strong characterization and a refusal to overplay. Karloff was at his most menacing when he was at his most subtle. *

Universal's attempt to reboot the ""Mummy"" franchise (the original series having produced some of the most God-awful films I've ever seen) is a major misfire. Stephen Sommers talks of ""honoring"" the earlier films, but he dishonors the original with a ""remake"" that isn't remotely as good.

Rudely stated, Sommers has no idea of how to make an effective horror and/or action film. You can't expect to frighten the audience with a persistently tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top tone. This tone is set at the beginning when Rachel Weisz knocks over a dozen huge bookcases, and never recovers. (The film, not Weisz.) It's there merely for the sake of a laugh, and has nothing to do with Weisz's character (who is /not/ portrayed in the rest of the film as clumsy or ineffective). There's nothing wrong with humor as a tension-breaker -- but it has to be /earned/, by actually /establishing/ tension in the first place. This problem could, in principle, be fixed with a rewrite -- but not when the director is also the writer.

What's far worse is that Sommers has no understanding of ""pace"" or ""focus"". If you want to genuinely thrill the audience, you have to at least /occaisionally/ slow down so that you can build up again. A roller coaster that's /always/ fast is no fun. Whatever ""The Mummy"" is, it's /not/ a roller-coaster ride.

Like too many films, ""The Mummy"" moves at a persistently brisk -- and ultimately boring -- speed. This results in Sommers glossing over moments that ought to have the audience on the edge of its collective seat. For example, when Weisz opens the Black Book and reads the invocation that inadvertently reanimates Imhotep, IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MOMENT IN THE FILM, when it /should/ be played up for all it's worth. You can't do this without preparing the audience, and that isn't possible when you're rushing along. I've never directed a movie, but I know /exactly/ how to do this -- with the appropriate dialog, camera angles, use of close-ups, music, etc., because I've seen it done many times by infintitely-better directors. **

Sommers rips off Ray Harryhausen, but apparently has never bothered to study Harryhausen's films. RH believed in the ""slow build"", both in the film as a whole, and within sequences. In ""Jason and the Argonauts"", seven skeletons pop out of the ground to wreak havoc. Harryhausen slowly /builds/ the scene -- and ratchets up the tension -- until it explodes. In ""The Mummy""'s comparable scene, with priest mummies popping out of the ground, there is no tension and release. They just pop out.

Stephen Sommers is an incompetent director, the $400M gross of this film notwithstanding. ""The Mummy"" is a film to be watched once, as an object lesson in how /not/ to make such films, then put aside.

* When asked if he was bothered at being typecast, William Henry Pratt replied that it assured him of a paycheck. He earned that paycheck with performances he never needed to apologize for. Who says that because you're starring in a horror film, you're not obliged to act well? Pratt did.

** Hitchcock comes to mind. In ""Psycho""'s shower scene, Mrs Bates doesn't just pop in and knife Marion -- the sequence /builds/ to the murder. Similarly, the scene in which Marion's sister enters the fruit cellar, walks over to Mrs Bates, and puts her hand on the old woman's shoulder, has a terrific payoff that /the entire film/ has been building up to.",1271548800,,3766,4.809891808346213

Brendan Frasier seems obviously unimpressed with everything throughout the movie. It's always a bummer in a movie series when the usual actor for a reoccurring character has to replaced. Rachel Weisz doesn't return as Evie this time, and the replacement brings none of the humor, intelligence or vulnerability to the role. John Hannah does return but bad writing and the lack of Rachel Weisz to play off of make him less likable this time. The chemistry between Rick and Evie is broken in the same way. The estrangement between Alex and his parents, as well as portrayal of Rick and Evie as ""old hands at this sort of thing"" gives it kind of a feeling of ripping off Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",1265846400,,1039,4.591397849462366

3188975,4,B00004D2X8,"I didn't see all of this movie until recently-- only snatches. When it originally came out in the theaters in 1999, it looked like a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" rip-off and the reviews were bad. Then, as now, I considered ""Raiders"" to be the closest thing to a perfect movie there would ever be, so I wasn't about to entertain lesser imitators. 11 years later, having let down my guard a bit, I have to say The Mummy was an awesomely good time. Brendan Fraser is a sweet hero. There's an openness about his Rick that you don't usually see in action leads. Rachel Weisz is perfect as the plucky, klutzy smart girl, in classic movie actress fashion. There's a lot of humor, which I believe is the only way to make an action movie click. I'm sorry I was such a snob. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

In the DVD extras, please don't miss the behind the scenes look at the battle between the mummy army and Rick as he saves Evelyn. The chorography involved in the scene is amazing, since there is no one there for Brendan Fraser to play against. It's an unbelievable solo dance that worked perfectly once the CG monsters were added later.

A reviewer once asked why people keep doing dumb things. Part of the fun is saying, ""stay in the car"" or in this case ""don't read that!""

3188978,1,B00004D2X8,"...you might consider taking her word for it. Especially if she's Rachel Weisz. And especially if she was part of the ensemble that made the first two 'Mummy' films work. Needless to say, she was not involved in this film, citing the script. Knowing that ahead of time, I should have taken her word for it, like the filmmakers ought to have, and avoided it like a plague. Instead, I suffered through the 2 hours of this disgrace to film. The things that went wrong with this movie are too many to state in one review, so I'll state the worst of the offenses:

Casting Maria Bello. Granted, she's replacing Rachel Weisz, an impossible job for any actress. But casting this actress? Who looks/sounds/acts NOTHING like Weisz at ALL is just cheap, unintelligent, and degrading. She tries, certainly, but she has to try hard, and with everything, and fails--her British accent (she's from Pennsylvania) slips and falls constantly, her chemistry with Brendan Fraser is non-existent, and she is completely unbelievable as the once tough-as-nails in-the-Princess-Leia-vein Evie O'Connell. (Oh, and by the by, writers: Evie fictionalized their adventures to sell as stories? Please. We saw the house they had; they were in no trouble for money, and would never EVER go around selling stories like that. It was good film-making when they treated events as ""Oh, not this AGAIN!"" It is bad film-making when they go ""Oooh, I can write another story off this!"". Come. ON.)

Leaving Egypt/Dropping Oded Fehr. At this point in the series, both were established elements, one as the perfect setting (mysticism, sweeping vistas, and lots and lots of mummies) and the other as the righteous warrior Medjai, Ardeth Bai. Honestly, the filmmakers could have gotten away with dropping one or the other--but not both, especially not with the humor (something this film desperately lacked) that having an Egyptian warrior in China could have provided.

Casting Luke Ford. I genuinely don't know what could have possibly been going on at that casting office. First, they take a character who is established as very British--born, raised, and accented--and make him the worst kind of John Wayne-stereotyped American. Second, cast an Australian actor to play this now-Americanized Alex O'Connell, and have him use a John Wayne voice to complete the stereotype. I think even Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin, two of America's dumbest men, would look at that and go, ""yeeeeesh, bad idea.""

Wasted Talent. Michelle Yeoh?! Jet Li?! Two of the best actors I've seen, and they were squandered. Both are skilled artists, capable of playing amazing characters, and here they play the worst kind of wooden cariacatures imaginable. A witch who somehow manages to learn English, buy clothes, raise a daughter, and still watch over the Emperor's Tomb without ever leaving once? A terracotta'd corpse that has mastery over the elements, yet only uses them two or three times? The sheer unbelievability and imbecility of this story should've been warning signs to these two actors.

The Script. Oh. Dear. Lord. The two who wrote this film (Alfred Gough and Miles Millar) are brilliant guys. Really, they are. They know how to write compelling characters (the TV series 'Smallville') write for humor (Jackie Chan's 'Shanghai Noon' & 'Shanghai Knights' films)and action/drama (Millar contributed to 'Spider-Man 2' and 'Iron Man'). So what in hell happened here? The characters are flatter than pressed leaves--even the once-humorous and likable Rick O'Connell is dull and uninteresting, despite Fraser's efforts to make it work. The storyline is at once absurdly over-the-top and also poorly underdone (Shangri-La...consists of a cave and a fountain? Yeti...are used in a single sequence and then abandoned? Two mummy armies...that the script ignores [a huge potential for action/comedy] to focus on the characters it has forced us to not care about?) The dialogue is pathetically childish and painfully unfunny. Even John Hannah's Jonathan, always good for a laugh, falls completely flat.

Honestly, if Amazon let me give a 0-star rating, I would have. Please, save yourselves: don't borrow this movie out of the library, don't rent it, and for God's sake, don't buy it. If possible, destroy it; watching the disc melt, crack and explode in a fire would be a far better use of the disc, your time, and be more entertaining in 2 minutes than this movie's 2 hours.",1262476800,,4418,5.11218836565097

Starving people all around the world could have been fed on the money it took to make this drivel.  When Rachel Weisz turned down the role that should have been the end of it, but no... they just kept right on dragging themselves deeper into the pit of insanity by recasting the role with a new actress who lacks all of the charm - no pretending Evy didn't live or stayed home this time.  We aren't idiots.  The film makers, on the other hand, evidently are.  The first two movies were great fun.  We prefer to pretend this third doesn't even exist.  It will never be a part of our collection.  We would rather pay more money per film to own only the first two on blu-ray than to pay less per film to get the box set of three (though if the box set offered the Scorpion King and the first two Mummy movies we'd be ok with that, as an earlier DVD box set release did).",1261353600,,986,4.152631578947369

Despite this, the Mummy has spawned two sequels, a spinoff, with the spinoff getting a straight to DVD sequel.  Some out there likes these movies and with good reason, they are a lot of fun.  Mummy 3 is no different.  There are a lot of fun, great action, and good special effects.  It was fun, maybe dumb fun, but fun nonetheless.  Sure, there are flaws.  Rachel Weisz is sorely missed, and while her replacement is fine, the lack of the original character is noticeable.  Also, the son, now a full grown man, has switched accents, and has some unexplained resentment to his father, which feels it was done for plot purposes.  Also, its amazing how little Jack has aged in the span of the three movies.

While most people found Maria Bello a bad choice to replace Rachel Weisz, I wasn't bothered by it. Not as much at least when they replaced Dick York with Dick Sargeant on Bewitched. Bello had her own interpretation of the character and she delivered. Jet Li was an interesting choice for a mummy and I wish the actual actor featured more in it but the few scenes he was in were good, but the Emperor seemed to be a stronger villain than Imhoptep. Though the emotional conflict which Imhotep possessed is missed. Michelle Yeoh, again for the few scenes she was in were good, the fight with Jet Li being the best. The supporting cast however is where this movie fails. The supporters of the villain (along with their goal) is too generic, the son doesn't even resemble the character from the second film and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter is stiff. But the special effects are excellent, the final sequence being the standout. The chase in Shanghai is good but drags a bit. The Yetis look good but whoever thought up that idea should be fired; they come completely out of left field and add nothing to the story.

Under Sommers, the first two films were fun, exciting, action packed FX-driven extravaganzas along the lines of Indiana Jones. In short, i liked them a lot. Now, Director Rob Cohen takes over the franchise, and while its not quite as brilliant as the first two, it's still fun and has its moments.
Brendan Frazer returns as Rick, intrepid adventurer and Maria Bello now takes over the role of Evelyn, since now Oscar winner Rachel Weisz didn't want to be part of the franchise again (I missed her sexy presence). This time, our heroes battle an ancient Chinese warlord bent on world conquest (oh, what fun). Jet Li plays the villian. Luke Ford plays Rick and Evelyn's son, now all grown up. Believe me, i didn't quite believe Ford and Frazer as father and son (there looked like a ten yr age difference between the two actors, for God's sake).

3188995,5,B00004D2X8,"Another favorite franchise of mine, the movies just never fail to deliver. In this, probably the ""scariest"" out of the three, we have the prologue that explains Imhotep's backstory and motivations then jump to Brendan Fraser's (another favorite actor of mine) character with the French Foreign Legion defending the City of the Dead in 1923 then jump another three years where we're introduced to Rachel Weisz's character and the rest of the story. A remake, and I use the term loosely, of the 1932 classic, so some story elements remain the same. Imhotep however gets an upgrade. From a walking corpse to his fully regenerated self, he possesses super-human abilities and can summon the ten plagues of Egypt. Fraser and Weisz have a chemistry together reminiscent, I think anyway, of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg of The Avengers. John Hannah as Weisz's greedy brother Jonathan and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, O'Connell's cowardly ""friend"" are the comic relief in this but are nonetheless entertaining. Arnold Vosloo is great as Imhotep, ably conveying a sense of menace and tortured romance. A small bit part of a retired RAF Col., Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay from Bewitched) is funny and charming when he talks about not going down in a blaze of glory like his comrades. The effects and action sequences are top-notch, the mummy effects being brilliantly done by ILM.

This movie is no exception, but something about it is more appealing to me compared to all those Indiana Jones and James Bond films. The visual effects are pretty stunning, I know that much. The snowmen/ape creatures were unique, the transformations involving the main mummy were VERY well done and looked stunning to be completely honest, and the story was good enough that I'd call it enjoyable.

Even the army of creatures with swords that we saw at the end of the movie were pretty fun, though it was hard to believe only a few people were able to take ALL of them out, haha. But they were so WEIRD looking, and every time their heads would be chopped off I'd sit there amazed how cool it looked. This is one beautiful movie.

Maybe I should check out more movies with a similar feel and style and not just write them off as ""terrible"" so quickly, because honestly, these kind of storylines CAN in fact be enjoyable given some time to adjust to the overall whacky style the writers must have been going for. The action is good, the characters... well, they could have been better to be honest. A British woman, an American guy (who I didn't particularly care for) and his obnoxious son.

'The Mummy Returns' was pretty bad, almost causing me to not even give this third outing a look. Since it came on cable I decided to give it a shot.

The film starts out promising with a cool set up in China, but soon after the opening credits role it goes downhill. The makers of these films try forcing so many comedic elements into them; it takes all tension away and actually slows the pace of the film down. This film could have been pretty good, if it was played a little more serious. In fact if they deleted the entire ridiculous comedy and uninspired romances scenes out, it would play much better. It's very frustrating to see a good idea gone so terribly wrong.

To make matters worse the CGI is unconvincing most of the time and having Yeti make goal post GOOD signs with their arms is nothing short of ludicrous! This film and all of the films in the series should have been played straight.

Not a great film but fun.  I believe Rachel Weisz carries this film, however, and it wouldn't have worked without her.",1245715200,,645,4.8090909090909095

She just didn't do Evy justice.  The son was a bit of a joke as well.  This was not one of Jet Li's better movies.  I enjoyed War and the One, to name a couple, but not here.

3189011,2,B00004D2X8,"The Bottom Line:

It's not like the first two Mummy films were great films, but the cast exuded low-key charm and the adventures were fun enough; in the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, by contrast, the cast (conspicuously missing Rachael Weisz) goes through the emotions of the ridiculous screenplay while third-rate CGI dominates the back of the screen and everyone watching the film wonders why they even bothered.",1245369600,,412,5.0588235294117645
3189012,3,B00004D2X8,"Well contrary to some peoples opinions, I quite liked it. Having recently watched a program on the first emperor Qin Shi Huang Di I can see where many of the plot lines on the Emperor come from and as a piece of escapist tosh it's OK. But it really isn't as good as it should have been:-
1. The new Evie hasn't got the deftness of touch that Rachel Weisz had and as a result the light hearted banter between her and Rick that was such fun in the first two movies and lifted them out of the ordinary just falls flat here. Whatever her acting abilities may be Maria Bello can't do Evelyn O'Connell.
2. Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li are woefully underutilized.
3. Alex who was English in the second movie is suddenly very American, go figure.
4. The music in the first two movies was grandiose overblown almost in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia, it added hugely to the ambiance. The soundtrack to Dragon King is just by the numbers, totally anonymous and adds nothing.
5. Transportation, the aircraft used is a Bristol Beaufighter, a two seat strike fighter noted for its cramped accommodation, chances of fitting six people and a yak in one without first passing them through a liquidizer is nil. Still I suppose it's an improvement on a jet propelled balloon.
6. The Dragon kings Dragon form looks rather too much like King Ghidorah from the Godzilla movies and very little like a Chinese Imperial dragon.

What's the moral of this, well I suppose when your script causes sufficient problems that one of the stars drops out and you can't get the proven Director on board, it really is time to pause and rethink. Ploughing ahead bull headed leaves you with a second rate product, an angry clientle and possibly a dead franchise. Maybe if some film execs could actually bring themselves to consider their own fallibility and leave a proven product in the hands of those that know how to do it properly we'd have fewer sucky sequels.",1244332800,,1929,4.57514450867052
3189013,1,B00004D2X8,"You would think after all the truly disastrous sequels that have been done over the years, that movie makers would learn one basic rule; if you have to replace a primary character because the actor/actress is unavailable, either write the character out of the script or simply don't do the movie.  You'd think that Brendon Fraser would have known this lesson as he skillfully avoided the horror that was ""George of the Jungle 2"".  How many otherwise promising sequels have be ruined because the producers decided it was better to take short cuts?  This is my first and biggest gripe about ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"".

I won't reiterate all the details of this movie and it's failings...if you're reading this, you can easily get that from the other reviews already here.  I do have a few specific issues though that I feel need to be mentioned.  While I'm sure that otherwise Maria Bello is a fine actress, she simply did NOT have the on-screen chemistry with Brendon Fraser that Rachel Weisz did as the character Evelyn O'Connell.  As ANY good movie buff can tell you, aside from writing and story plots, it's the chemistry between the actors as the characters that will make or break a movie.  The interaction between Fraser and Bello in this incarnation of ""The Mummy"" just seems forced at best and there really is no chemistry to speak of.  This in and of itself seriously diminishes Fraser's performance to little more than ""I really can't believe I needed the money this badly"".

The idea behind this plot and script held a great deal of promise.  Instead of rehashing the previous two movies (particularly after the period of time that has elapsed), this new idea...and new ""Mummy"" had some potential.  It's one of those concepts that probably seemed like a really good idea at the time but the execution was very poor and came off more as the movie makers just trying to cash in on a previously successful franchise without having to put a great deal of effort into it.  While the performance of the ""new"" characters in this movie are very good, the main characters of ""Rick O'Connell"", his companions and their exploits for which this series is based are simply very poor and not strong enough to carry the movie at all.

Again I won't go into the details of the plot but I have to honestly say that this movie wasn't worth the $1 I payed to rent it and it's certainly NOT worth the cost of purchase.  If you enjoyed the first two movies in this series, don't spoil it by getting this one...the magic is gone and it's simply not worth it.",1243987200,,2560,4.607929515418502

It would have been better with Rachel Weisz as the leading lady though.  Maria Bello was competent, but lacked Weisz' vibrant style.  Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh brought in superior martial arts performances as well as playing their roles with style, which offset this lack a bit.

This was an Indiana Jones-Jason And The Argonauts combination adventure story. It's cartoon-like in nature with an absurd swashbuckling hero, outlandish action scenes and the occult theology that filmmakers love so much. (The Mummy has God-like powers, even producing Old Testament plagues.)

However, the film is too long by about 10-15 minutes and there is simply too much action and too much noise. The film needs more lulls.

Brendan Fraser is pretty good as the Indiana Jones figure and Rachel Weisz, a new face at the time, makes a solid impression in her debut. The DVD offered a sharp picture which highlighted a number of jaw-dropping scenes. It's pure escapist fun and not meant to be anything else.

*Spoilers*

I love The Mummy series, but this addition is simply terrible - a lazy retread of of its predecessors in hopes of wringing a few more dollars out of this franchise.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor seems one of those Hollywood movies devoted to making marriage look as pleasant as a root canal. Rick and Evie have stopped being passionate soul-mates who carefully balance their exploratory endeavors with less dangerous, but no less interesting pursuits (as in the second Mummy movie) and have, instead, been turned into the stereotypical empty-nest drudgery marriage. Evie no longer manages museums and attracts the praise of the historical community - she writes historical romances where she (disturbingly) has re-envisioned the most horrifying moments of her life as sexually exciting events. Really, my gorge rose when Evie tried to make the scene where she had been tied down next to a writhing, rotting mummy with a dagger poised over her heart as an erotic game to entice her tired husband to bed. Evie doesn't need an adventure - she needs counseling.

(Or perhaps it is the director who needs the counseling - the odd sexual connotations keep coming over and over through the course of this movie. Alex (a grown man now) confesses to his mother that he is not a virgin and she brightens in relief and asks chirpily ""How many?"" partners he has had, and seems positively panting for details. And Alex and his dad, Rick, spend far too much time arguing that ""size matters"" when it comes to...guns.)

Once the marital bickering is over and the action starts, we are treated to a lame, lazy retread of the first two movies. The motivations of the mummy are boring and trite without the depth of the previous movies (I preferred the motivation of 'true love' to a plain, straightforward ""Megalomaniac Seeks Immortality"" reading).

Oh, yes, and there's also a vomit scene. Do you know what made the other Mummy movies genuinely good flicks instead of soulless retreads? A lack of vomit, among other things. Thanks, Hollywood.

This movie provides captions for the hearing impaired.

3189036,2,B00004D2X8,"The first two Mummy flicks were both obvious labors of love by Stephen Sommers, their writer/director. They were amazing showcases for CGI effects, but beyond that they had engaging stories full of pulp action, lots of comedy that did not descend into camp, and wonderful characters performed by perfectly cast actors. Brendan Fraser, as American soldier-of-fortune Rick O'Connell, was a perfect pulp hero, brash and cocky and capable. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn ""Evy"" O'Connell (n Carnahan) was the brilliant and (extraordinarily) sexy librarian who could hold her own in a scrap. Together they had incredible chemistry, crack comic timing, and the charm and natural repartee of a classic  Hollywood couple (like Gable and Lombard, or Powell and Loy).

Throw in John Hannah as Evy's sleazy but lovable brother, Arnold Vosloo as great villain Imhotep (whose ultimate fate, at the end of the second film, possesses pathos and tragedy), and a host of great supporting roles, and you have some flicks with great characters on the screen at all times. Even the kid who plays the O'Connell's son, Alex, in the second film is brash and bratty without being annoying, a rare thing in a character like his.

The O'Connell's adventures continued in a short-lived cartoon that was fairly good, and I remember it fondly as one of the few sources of pulp goodness I could share with my then five-year-old son.

He and I watched The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor last night. When I say it's incredible, well, you'd darn well better believe that I am lying. Flat out full of it. On a George W. Bush scale. Because it's terrible.

Here's what's good about it:

  * The idea to do a third Mummy film.

  * The idea to use China as the setting, to do something different with the mummy idea this time around.

  * The idea to cast Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (always a great idea to cast either, an exceptional idea to have `em both).

  * Some cool creatures, like a really nicely done dragon, but especially the yeti. Because the yeti are the one point of absolute true awesome in the whole flick.

  * The final battle is okay.

You may notice that three of the things that are good about the movie start with ""The idea to..."" But those things ended without bringing the ideas to enjoyable fruition. The way it turned out, it was actually a bad idea to do a third Mummy film, the idea to use China was fine but the resulting story wasn't that interesting (though a good script doctor could have done great things with it), and they got Li and Yeoh in the film, and gave them both very little to do that was at all interesting.

This movie isn't a labor of love for Stephen Sommers, who this time just produced. It possesses none of the warmth or wit or charm of the previous films. The action is dull. The characters are uninteresting, and the main characters are written inconsistently with their earlier portrayals.

This is a bad movie. But beyond that, it's a bad movie with a worst thing about it. No, it's a bad movie with a Worst Thing About It. And that worst thing is Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz (who read the script and smartly refused to do it) as Evy.

This Worst Thing About It is two sided. First, it's bad because we lose Weisz, who was always magnetic and funny and smart and strong and just smoking hot as this character, and who had wondrous chemistry with Brendan Fraser.

Second, it's bad because we wind up with Bello, who is a very talented actress, but plays Evy with all the spunk and sexiness of a wad of mashed potatoes, and who has absolutely no chemistry with Fraser.

I can't overstate how badly this miscasting damages the film. The relationship between Rick and Evy is the heart of these movies, and had Weisz returned, this film would be at least twice as watchable just because of the dynamic between her and Fraser. Bello's performance is a sinkhole that draws the attention and drains away even what little vim there is in this movie. Even my son, who normally wouldn't be caught dead saying he cared about which actress plays a girl character, started kvetching almost immediately, and early in the film started cheering on the villains whenever they had Evy in deadly peril. He genuinely liked Rachel Weisz, and her replacement by Bello was so awful it was like a personal offense to him (and to me, and likely to a vast majority of fans of the previous films).

3189041,1,B00004D2X8,"Movie franchises, unlike most other human creations, often get worse with each subsequent incarnation.  This is quite aptly illustrated with Brendan Fraser's Mummy franchise.  The first Mummy came out in the spring of 1999, and was a commercial hit and probably the 2nd best movie of that year after the Matrix.  The 2nd Mummy came out several years later, and though interesting, had some ludicrious scenes in it.  This most recent Mummy just sucked.  If there was ever a perfect example of a movie in which the dialogue was used solely to join adjacent action scenes together, and provide an occasional slinger, this is it.  Unfortunately, even the action scenes were lackluster.

Worst of all, this movie lacked attention to detail in numerous scenes.  I will expand on this last point.  At the beginning of the movie, a narrator describes how the Dragon Emperor was turned to stone, and we see him frozen into a stance of pain and agony standing on the ground.  Outside his palace, his army is frozen into stone while in battle formation.  About 15 minutes later in the movie, this army is discovered in AD 1946, in a totally different formation, and the stone emperor is standing on a chariot holding the reins!  How do stone warriors change their stance?  Another screwed up scene was the episode in the Himalayas.  By the constant blizzard, I would guess the temperature of this setting is around 0 degrees F.  Several dozen characters are shown in this scene; many of them participating in dialogue, yet we cannot see any condensation from their breaths!  And probably the worst scene of all is the final fight scene between Fraser's character, Rick, and Jet Li's chracter, the Dragon Emperor.  Here we have numerous punches to the face on both sides, yet they each have perfect hair throughout the whole scene!  Absolutely ridiculous!

Even after leaving out these detail flaws, the acting is also horrible.  The romance scenes were totally contrived and rushed.  The mother - daughter scenes seemed fake, and Jet Li's portrayal as the Dragon Emperor was totally off.  His character seemed more like a general, or a magician, than that of an emperor.  There was no hint of nobility, regality, or supremacy in his role; only violence.  Probably the worst portrayal was that of Alex O'Connell.  This guy is supposed to be British, raised in the snobbish upper-crust of British aristocracy.  He seemed more like Indiana Jones.  And this leads to the biggest flaw of the movie; it seemed like a watered-down version of an Indiana Jones movie.

So, I know that Jet Li's movements are authentic and realistic, even though we do not see enough Jet Li in this movie. I also enjoy movies by Jack Lee, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme but, I like Jet Li movies best. In fact, I like Jet Li so much that I would give a movie in which he stars an automatic 5 star. For patrons who are not familiar with Wu Shu (Chinese Kung Fu), I would suggest you buy and watch ""Dragons of the Orient"". Aside from Jet Li, this is a fantastic movie in terms of action sequences, story line and choice of sceneries. In my judgement, all the actors and actresses performed their roles very well. But, I must admit that I am enchanted by the mother. She displays such beautiful British mannerisms that I cannot help but to fall in love with her. I do not want to spoil the story for the patrons, but, in a nutshell, a dragon emperor and his army were cursed by a witch never to be lifted again lest they will enslave the world. But, the archaeologists mistakenly brought the Shang Ri La's eye to China  and awakened the dragon emperor. Then came a race against time to stop the emperor before he could reach the magic pool and raise his army, and then to bring them across a boundary to make them invisible. Incidentally, Michelle Yeoh looks great as the witch. All action movie aficionados will be endowed with a great pleasure by this movie.",1234483200,,1479,4.263345195729538

There are disconnects between this movie and the previous movie. The son was British, but now very American. It could happen, I suppose, but not likely. Fraser is ok in the movie. He seems like he could do this movie in his sleep. The obnoxious brother-in-law is more annoying in this one than the first two. The romance still works between Fraser and his wife. Bello as the wife is ok. The movie takes place in China and I thought that worked. Shangri-la was cool.

In summary, the movie barely works if you keep your expectations low. Yeoh is good and so is the daughter. The CGI and the special effects are good. Rent don't buy this movie.",1234224000,,803,4.248366013071895

This movie was horrible.  Sets a new standard for ""jumping the shark.""

I'm a big fan of Brendan Fraiser, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. LOVED the first two mummy movie.

Now I'm an even bigger fan of Rachael Weisz for not acting in this disaster.

The script was laughable (as in ""Ouch! Did they really just say that?!?""), the plot was watered down from the second installment and tended to take ridiculous leaps. The entire story insulted the legendary history of China. (I thought ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" was better than this pile of garbage.

There was none of the humor and wit from the first two movies.

Jet Li had too few lines. Maria Bello had too many.

3189054,1,B00004D2X8,"Mummy 3 should have been called Soapdish 2 rather than be included in the Mummy series.  We're actually to believe that Luke Ford, who is pushing 30, is the son of Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello who are in their early 40's at most.  You can literally see Fraser cringe when he has his ""father to son"" talks in the flick.  And let's be honest you kind of get the feeling this was a vehicle for Luke Ford rather than Fraser, Bello and Li.  Bello btw, is just horrible.  I like her better in movies with her top off rather than see her feign a piss poor English accent.  Rachel Weiz (sp?) really did make hold her own in the previous entries.

Other ef ups/Jumping The Shark, Yeti's come out of nowhere to save the day, Jet Li turns into King Ghidorah, John Hannah bombs and machine guns the Nationalists from a CGI air freighter.  Hannah, who I liked immensely in the other Mummy's is used strictly to show that this is indeed another Mummy sequel.  A total waste of good talent.

Jet Li's character?  What does he care that he wakes up thousands of years later?  Neon lighting, automobiles, airplanes, guns, Doublemint gum?  He doesn't have time to marvel at modern times he has a terra cotta army to awake and take over China.  Thank heaven he's defeated be a general he had killed.  I was kind of sad at seeing that, I would have liked to see how Li's character would have done against the Long Marchers.  Maybe the US would have funded his terra cotta army to defeat Mao first and Kim Il-sung later....but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Perfect english..no british accent??? Why didn't they just use the same little actor, he would have been much older and more believable. The new Evie tried but could not bring that character to life like Rachel did. The chemistry was not there between Brendan and her either. Not her fault really, she did try. I do blame the producers and the director for screwing up this proven formula, but Rachel no matter how bad at least the set would have been complete...damn! That was my BIGGEST disappointment...NO RACHEL ""Im a librarian"" Totally hit the mark with her portrayal. Perfect chemistry between Brendan and her big brother. Incidently the big brother part was perfect as it was in the first 2 films....kudos to this gifted actor.
The producers and director really missed the point. DON'T change the recipe half way thru. Screwed up my DVD Mummy set for good.

They are considering a 4th installment to the Franchise. I hope they get it right this time. Gemma Arterton should play Evie' if Rachel doesn't do it. NO DOUBT IN MY MIND GEMMA ARTERTON from Prince of Persia should have been given the part in the the third installment. The same passion and look of Rachel.. even the same voice tone.

Next, we get this idea that somehow, this is a Martial Arts showcase movie, not the horror-lite, adventure film like it's predecessors. Take all that into consideration and wrap it all into a script that would've been better to wrap fish in and you start to get the idea. This movie stinks - really stinks - worse than ""Big Trouble in Little China"" bad. I don't know, I used to think Brendan Fraser had some potential in this genre, but now .... what a lunkhead of an actor.

But at least it has enough mindless action to somewhat save it. Yet, you have to wade through a 'daddy issues' subplot, whiny and sometimes atrocious dialogue, and questions like, 'How exactly did the son lose his heavy British accent in the course of 10-20 years, in order to sound almost American?'

In the 1st Mummy of this series, there was a great blend of horror/action/adventure. The 2nd lightened up the tone, replacing most of the horror with a great sense of humor; of course, it was a retread of the first, but it was probably best of the series because it was the most entertaining. The 3rd on the other hand does bring the action, but that's about it, as it leaves you shaking your head more often then not.

the original actress that played Evie left because of script problems and i can see why. i actually had to pause the movie to see why she wasn't in it. after hearing why she left made the movie a lot more bearable.
anyways the script was bad; Jet Li has barley any lines, there is no connection between Rick and Evie, the lines sucked, and where is alex's accent? and how did everyone wind up in china? i thought everything was based around egypt and such. it just so happens that Johnathan owns a bar right down the street from the museum that the emporer was awoke from. and where is the past connection to the last mummy movies?
 it is downright horrible. from the first 2 mummy movies, you would never have guessed rick and evie having relationship troubles. and yet the script includes it, i don't see how they could have problems. and what was the deal with the ending? evie's brother says he is going to peru and then the screen starts to fade and it says ""soon after mummies are found in peru"" WTF? that was unexpected and that ruined the movie for me. that ending could have been better (a lot better) then what it was. i am going to hate to see the next 3 mummy movies. hopefully someone gets fired or does some actual work (or maybe they put Rachel back as the mother) because the producers ruined the mummy franchise by this movie.",1233273600,,1489,4.356115107913669

The move from Egypt to China is something I don't think the movie could overcome, but it was different and it was nice to see another country's legends and mythology on screen.

The points where it was lacking, and there are a few, is that the chemistry in the movie is completely lacking like in the first two. The replacement wife and Fraser just don't seem to click. Try as they might it just never seems to happen. This time around Fraser and the guy who plays Jonathan just seem like they just met and are still feeling each other out. This movie doesn't have the same zing to it as the others either. I felt Jet Li was actually under used. It's like they just wanted him for his martial arts and that's it.

3189078,5,B00004D2X8,"In The Mummy, Steven Sommers has given us a modern classic film. The quality (in all areas: acting casting, cinematography, directing, music, special effects) is impeccable, and the storyline unique.
  This film tells the story of a librarian named Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (played by John Hannah), who come across a map that leads to Hamunaptra, a burial city said to contain enormous treasure, the Book of the Dead, and the Book of Amun-Ra. They enlist the help of a rag-tag American named Rick O'Connell (played by Brendan Fraser), who claims to have been to the city before.
  Along the way, they find that they are not the only ones after the City of the Dead, and two separate groups reach the City simultaneously. During their stay at Hamunaptra, some smart, ""unsuperstitious"" person decides to read a spell from the recently unearthed Book of the Dead, which in turn awakes a mummy cursed to be undead for eternity. This mummy, named Imhotep, wishes to reawake the woman he loved millennia ago, and then conquer the world. It is up to those who awoke him to put him back in his grave. Sounds like fun!
  I believe this to be a landmark film. The special effects are very realistic, with barely a trace of CGI ""gooiness"". Jerry Goldsmith's (so sad that he has passed away now) score is haunting, beautiful, and unforgettable. And Stephen Sommers proves himself to be the director for good, exciting fun in movies!

P.S. ----Please, if you value your health, your sanity, and your life, never, EVER, watch The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Stay away from it like it was the plague! Fear it like the mummy's curse!

I ended up fast forwarding to the end to see if there was any merit here. There wasn't. The actress who played Evie was absolutely horrible - without that sense of continuity and chemistry between Brendan Frasier and the adorable and much-missed Rachel Weisz (if she really did turn it down because of the script I love her even more) there was nothing to hook you - and I wasn't buying that new guy as their son either.

The premise of this one is Alex O'Connell, now a grown man, discovers the tomb of the legendary Dragon Emperor. As he is about to unveil his find to the public, his parents show up for an unexpected visit while bringing back an artifact to the Chinese government. The artifact, unknown to the O'Connells, is actually the key to freeing The Dragon Emperor from his curse! Many attempted twists and turns on this one.

To be honest, the back story about Jet-Li's character is the probably the BEST part of the whole film! After that, the plot gets iffy! As I said earlier, it has its moments but overall it comes out very weak. While Jet Li is usually very good, I never felt like he was a real threat in this one. As for the actress that filled in for Rachel Weize as Evelyn O'Connell, I kind of felt sorry for her because she was stepping into a role that was made so good by Rachel. On its own merit, her performance wasn't that bad, its just too bad she had Rachel to be compared to. Everyone else was just okay.

Can't fault the man for that.  Yum.  Anyway!

It is my own opinion that ""The Mummy:  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" isn't a bad movie, but it suffers largely from the fact that the film's pace is so rushed.  There is so much going on in the story that 112 minutes is not nearly enough time to tell all of it properly.

The movie takes us from Singapore (where we barely take notice of Jonathan as the owner of a lush casino named after Imhotep) to the Himalayas to Shangri-La (very easy travel for our ragtag band of heroes) with one chase or gunfight scene after another, with such little attention paid towards the relationships between the O'Connells (maybe there would've been better chemistry between Bello and Fraser had there been more mushy Rick-and-Evie moments) or Alex with his parents or his uncle Jonathan.

I enjoyed the characters played by Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, though their screen time was shockingly limited and their interactions together was over much too quickly.  It seems like much more could've been done to flesh out their characters, and what could've been a great fight scene between them was cut too short.  The immortality of Yeoh and her daughter was given up almost immediately following Yeoh's appearance at Shangri-La, and did nobody notice that Yeoh's lover, and father of her daughter, was the leader of the soldiers that rose from below the Great Wall to battle the Emperor's vast army?  It was very obvious that was who he was, yet there was no interaction between him and his daughter, or him with Yeoh...and with all the build-up of their great love in the beginning, you'd think there would be something.

There was simply so much that was either glossed over or ignored completely, and it brought the movie down.  The actors did the best they could with the script, but despite their efforts this does not measure up to the first two Mummy movies.  It is worth checking out and deciding for yourself, but I would only buy this to complete your Mummy collection.",1231718400,,2947,5.403930131004367

The Yetti looked totally CG and the signal they made of ""field goal"" made my laugh and shake my head at the same time.

The second, as previously indicated, was a disappointment.  However, everyone has more than redeemed themselves with this superb suspense thriller.

At the time this movie came out, I don't recall hearing that much about it.  I think it was released about the same time as the last (please God) Indiana Jones which was all anyone seemed to be able to talk about (it, in my opinion, was a dud--but I digress).

The fact that this third in the Mummy series takes place in China did not bother me as it appears to have some.  The action is, literally, non stop and the movie did a terrific job in its recreation of time and place (1940s).  Brandon Fraser is a great action hero and never fails to charm.

First... Rachel Weisz does not play the wife/mother. Bad bad bad move... keep the family intact or make up a reason why she's not appearing at all. The scenes with the new female were way out of line from what you would expect from the first two movies. She was more hesitant, mystic in the first two. She didn't attempt lame comedic lines in the first two.
Second... when you mix cultures that are far enough apart, it takes fine tuning. That didn't happen. And I hope it doesn't happen in any subsequent takes on the new mummy theme. It just didn't work.
Third.... the new Mummy. Just didn't work.
Fourth... the 'comedy relief' lines.... really really didn't work.
In summary... don't waste your time. Stick to the first two, they were congruent and flowed nicely together. This one stuck out poorly.

The first notably mistake was the absence of Rachel Weisz. (Evelyn) If you can't get the whole original cast back for a movie, why bother? These things hardly ever pay off and the chemistry between Brenden Frasier & Maria Bello simply is not there.

The plot is that it takes place some time after the last Mummy movie and Evelyn had written 2 successful Mummy books based on there previous 2 adventures and is struggling to find any inspiration for a 3rd book. In her personal life her and husband Richard (Frasier) have settled down and are bored out of there mind when an opportunity to take an amulet to China comes along, where they figure they will deliver it and go see there son who has just uncovered an emperors tomb with his army that was put there after being cursed by a witch. So yadda yadda yadda, the Emperor is freed and they try to stop him from reaching a pool of eternal life to raise his army.

It sounds a bit better then it was, as it seemed all the focus was put into the FX of the movie and little in character development, story line or plot. I'm sure anyone watching this in China would wonder why the hell they cast Jet Li in a non martial arts role and why the heck he is fighting abdominal snowmen?

In the first 2 mummy movies, there was an excitement of action that they could have ended the movie a long time before they did, but it kept going on getting more exciting and a bigger finale then the last... however this one lacks that completely. The end of the movie just seemed to come, happen and it was over with no big climax to it.

And even tho the last 2 movies may have had you suspend disbelief, this one seemed like they would just try anything, no matter how outlandish just to get the movie over and done with.

Even Brendan Fraisor shows signs of no interest in being in this movie, as he performers one of his most lamest performances to date with cheap little stale jokes thrown in between with bad timing, or drowned out by the musical score trying to somewhat add live to a flat-lining movie.",1231286400,,2241,4.298578199052133

The only relationship that seemed genuine was the one between Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong, which, I'll admit, was convincing and tender.  Jet Li was woefully underused as he gave as intense a performance as his limited role would allow.  Most importantly, however, removing the Mummy franchise from Egypt also removed all of the charm of its predecessors.  The first two films were fun, charming, and a joy to watch.

3189109,2,B00004D2X8,"For those of you who have read my reviews (for which I am grateful, by the way), you will undoubtedly have noticed the trend for these that has emerged over the time since I began writing them.  Initially, they consisted of two or more paragraphs which gave a general description of the film/s plot, followed by some commentary of the film's production aspects such as acting, writing, directing, etc.  Over time, the reviews grew longer and had more baroque lead-in & transitional paragraphs, accompanied by elements of editorial commentary.

For this review, I will try to keep the commentary (relatively) brief and won't incorporate lengthy editorializing:

THE MUMMY (1999) was a very creative and interesting film with a fantastic trailer, a great script, and very good dialogue.  It was a suspenseful action film that was able to ably integrate elements of horror and humor.  The acting was very effective all-around.  This highly effective combination made for not only an enjoyable film and impressive cinematic achievement, but is one of the few that could claim the overused and often undeserved title of ""New Classic"".

The first sequel (2001) was less clever and at least a little annoying.  The funniest (unintentionally) part of the film was the central notion to the theme of the wife suddenly becoming aware of ""oh that's right, I just remembered that I am a reincarnation of the evil queen's main rival and can take her on in a highly stylized and well-choreographed fight scene"".  It was literally almost that blatant.  In addition to the substitution of excessive CG effects in place of a well-written story, the film also had the clichd stereotype of the whiney/frightened Black sidekick.

Its second sequel (2008's THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR) had a poor script, bad acting (from good actors, which means lousy directing) and was just a lame and somewhat tedious & tired film altogether.  The lead actress was replaced (Maria Bello for Rachel Weisz), which was the closest thing to good acting (seeing Maria Bello do a passable British character).  Otherwise, it was wholly implausible that the two main characters were parents to an adult son.  All dialogue between the son (Luke Ford) and the cute Asian good quasi-ninjette (Isabella Leong) consisted of loud and campy declarative affectations that came straight out of a bad Neil Simon play (is there any other kind?) or a 1930's film.  Brendan Frazier's dialogue was reduced to stock theater gruntings as if lifted from a 1940's or 50's film.  John Hannah was reduced to saying loud bewailments every time he spoke.  The addition of Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li was ostensibly for some impressive chop-socky action scenes, even though both are average and subpar actors respectively.  In fact, there was only a brief wire-fu sequence which was a long way from impressive.  The story was banal and insipid.  In spite of some impressive visuals, the film just wasn't all that good.

The first film required a significant suspension of disbelief, but was a competently written & filmed story.  What all three have in common is the idiotic notion that an evil guy will be banished in death with a terrible curse which is somehow escapable, and allows that he will have super powers once he comes back to life.  How about in place of a super-curse, you just kill the guy and make sure he stays dead or powerless.  I suppose that is just navely wishful thinking...

By the way, the last line of the film suggests there's a fair to decent chance there will be another sequel.  Yikes.",1231200000,,3557,4.914572864321608

3189111,2,B00004D2X8,"...the ball was dropped on this film. Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.

Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....

The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.

Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.

Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.

In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.

Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.

Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.

And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics. At first, the Yetis were fluff, but then you start to like them. They are the `untarnished good' surrounded by evil.

The special effects are admirable. The battle scenes at the end are exceptional. The warriors (and Han) turning to sand and clay are so cool, myself and my friends all gave it a big `WHOA!'.

Brendan Fraser's character and his movie-wife (a wasted Maria Bello)are now rich and bored and their son is in his early twenties. That's how you figure out Brendan and his new(old) wife are about twenty years older! When you consider how much was spent on sets,costumes,effects,etc; it's curious the lead man wasn't aged a day.

There are lame archeology jokes to remind you this movie is aping Indiana Jones,Yetis thrown in for those with adhd,and the icing on this steaming pile of fluff is the ending ripped right from the Lord of the Rings. It was a difficult film for me to stay awake through with the constant use of uninspired cgi,boring fight scenes,and bland characters.",1230508800,,1148,5.0473684210526315
3189121,4,B00004D2X8,"If I were to judge this movie according to the standards of serious movies it would get a non-rating, but it isn't meant to be a serious movie.  This is just a big budget light entertainment that has more to do with Hollywood serials from the early days of the movie industry than anything resembling an approach to art, originality, or meaning.  It is just supposed to be silly fun.  Do you like mummies?  If so, then you get to see it all again here, but on the other side of the world.  Like the old serials, the plot follows the same general trend and climaxes in a huge battle where good wins and evil is given the defeat it deserves.

Brendan Fraser is still Rick O'Connell, but Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weisz.  While I thought Bello played Evelyn O'Connell just fine, the rest of my family disliked the change intensely.  They probably should not have made the change.  While Jet Li's character has a big role in the movie, he has a small part, because most of the time Emperor Han is a computer generated monster.  But Jet Li's name was supposed to sell tickets.  While the movie cost $175 million to make, it only brought in $102 million in the U.S. market, but did $290 million overseas.  So, maybe it worked well for the producers when seen from a global perspective.  $392 million total box office (before DVD sales and other licensing rights) is pretty solid even with the disappointing domestic take.  I thought the plot point of having the son all grown up and a bit troubled was a nice addition and Luke Ford does a good job as Alex.

Whether or not you should see this movie is entirely based on how well you tolerate light sweets with no nutritional value.  Sometimes you feel like a candy bar instead of a salad.  I enjoyed it for what it aimed to be, but won't make any effort at all to remember it or think about what the movie ""was about"".  Really, it is just a bit of fun.

3189122,4,B00004D2X8,"After 7-years The Mummy franchise returns, but with a few changes; Stephen Sommers who wrote and directed the first 2 returns only as producer and half the cast is gone, but the character of Evelyn returns only played by Maria Bello rather than Rachel Weisz. Anyone that knows me pretty much knows that in general I'm not one for big Hollywood movies for the most part. Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been putting out some lousy flicks. Prior to that I Hollywood movies were fairly good overall, but I have to admit I really enjoyed The Mummy franchise. The first two were not great movies, but were highly entertaining.

But going into The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor my expectations were quite low. With new writers and a new director plus half the cast being gone I was hoping for something decent, but I didn't expect much, but Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was quite a surprise. While it's inferior to the previous two flicks in its own right it was enjoyable even with the flaws.

The script by Alfred Gough & Miles Miller was alright; it's never as amusing as the previous parts, but it does stay true to the franchise and mostly relies on the viewers knowing the characters. Overall the characters are just sort of there and they don't have the excellent character moments that had in the previous two, but like those movies the characters are still a lot of fun. The script could have used a touch up and it's pretty much your standard Hollywood action screenplay, but overall it serves its purpose.

I was never really much of a fan of director Rob Cohen, while he's done some decent movies personally I always find them slightly lacking and despite the flaws with The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'd say this is probably his best work thus far. While never as witty or creative as Stephen Sommers, Rob Cohen does get the job done on delivering a highly entertaining movie even with the flaws. The pacing was solid and there really are no slow moments and Cohen keeps the movie fun from the beginning to end.

I've liked Brendan Fraser ever since I saw Encino Man; what I like about him is he has this average everyday guy look rather than big Hollywood look and he's a lot better of an actor than he's given credit for. And once again Fraser is the man; I just love the character of Rick O'Connell and Fraser plays the part perfectly. This time around he doesn't have the great character moments like he did in the first two, but Fraser still makes the best out of it and delivers another solid performance and again is quite funny.

Maria Bello takes over the role of Evelyn O'Connell and does very well in the role. Personally I like Maria Bello more than Rachel Weisz, but I do think Rachel was a bit better as Evelyn, but Maria Bello is good enough and the movie doesn't suffer due to the re-casting of the role. John Hannah returns as Jonathan and this time around he seems to be here just for the sake of it. John Hannah stole the show in the first two and he almost does again, but he's just not given enough to do.

Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh are welcome additions to the cast even if not used to their full potential. You have Li and Yeoh in a movie and they aren't allowed to really showcase their skills, which was a shame. They do have a brief fight scene that while a bit disappointing fans of these two will still surly enjoy it just due to the fact it's Li Vs Yeoh. But both are underused for sure they never really get to showcase their skills, but both are still excellent.

The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is getting a lot of poor reviews and I'm not exactly sure why. While the first two movies were extremely fun I wouldn't say they were these epic classic films. They were simply fun and while yes this movie isn't as good it still serves its purpose as mindless entertainment just like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Again while inferior The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor still serves its purpose as a fun flick.

As fun as the movie was the franchise is running out of steam; the biggest flaw with the movie was really due to the fact there was nothing that could really be added to the concept, but I do think this series might still have a little bit of life left in it. Despite the mostly negative reviews I enjoyed The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, while inferior to the first two its still a fun ride that is far better than the reviews out there.

Picture and sound wise Tomb is the best of all of them.  It has a beautiful higdef vido transfor and a equaly good 5.1 DTS HD MA audio track that really creates a good surrond sound field.  There is also a good feature list with some highdef exclusive contant.  So the 2 disc (1 bd 50 gig and a dvd) blu-ray is well put togather and worth the extra $.

On to the movie.  When you go to see a movie like this its not for anything new its just to have a good time.  Action comedy/romance films like this generly follow the same formula.  Heros met vilian that seems undefitable and when things look the worst heros dig down trust in each other vilian is defited and heros fall in love and sail into sunset leving a opaning for another movie.  so what really matters is the visuals and the action.

I know Rachel Weisz wasn't interested in returning to the franchise, but it almost would have been better if the character was just written out of the film. Second, I just never bought Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell; I mean, how does a kid raised in England grow up to have an American accent?  Now, the film wasn't all bad.  I never get tired of watching Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh in fight scenes.  Seeing them together was just icing on the cake.

Film critic Roger Ebert hails THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR as the best of this series, and I guess that's why we have opinions. I happen to think that this third entry, while somewhat entertaining, is not as good as the first two films, not even close. This series, obviously more inspired by the Indiana Jones franchise than the Boris Karloff stuff, has never had the resonance or the pure rush of high adventure which made the first three Indy Jones flicks so memorable. And yet TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR has echoes of what I liked about the first two Mummy films. It's a silly movie, but it knows it's silly and invites you to embrace its campiness. Me, I liked the ride, up to a point.

Catching up with the O'Connells: It's 1946, and Rick and Evelyn O'Connell have fallen into a dreaded state, that of staid domesticity. Their adventuring days well behind them, Rick now whiles his time in incompetent fly-fishing, while Evie's writing career has stalled on writer's block. Oh, and their romance has gone in the way of ""meh..."" So how can't they help but perk up when the British Foreign Office offers them a mission of couriering a sacred relic back to the Chinese people. So off they go.

Seems to me that this particular mummy menace can be blamed on Rick and Evie's rebellious 20-year-old son Alex. Boy's followed his mother's scholarly ways and has become an archaeologist. And, even if he doesn't do the actual resurrecting, it's Alex who in China unearths the 2000-year-old Emperor and his army of terra-cotta warriors. Alex may not get on well with his dad, but, still, when an ancient evil warlord returns to life and dreams again of conquest, it's nice that one's parents have experience with stopping that sort of thing.

There may not be any pyramids in this one, but there are still tombs and sarcophagi. Perhaps to reinvigorate this series, the venue and mythology shift from Egypt to China, and, so, we get dragons and wushu, Shangri-La and yetis in the frozen Himalayas (who evidently are down with American football). The film also offers the possible (but kinda sketchy) origin of the Great Wall of China. But you know what? I miss the mummy Imhotep and I miss Oded Fehr as the grim, face-tattooed warrior who guards against the mummy's awakening. And I really miss Rachel Weisz. The quite unexpected choice to fill in as Evie is American actress Maria Bello and she actually does a fair job. But, no, it's not the same. On the other hand, Brendan Fraser is back as Rick O'Connell, and he's still got that affable, big lug charm. John Hannah is the other returnee, as Evie's greedy but likable brother Jonathan. Jonathan is now a thriving nightclub owner in Shanghai, which is very good news for the plot. He's still the predominant comic foil, which is one more dead horse these filmmakers don't mind beating.

Another thing to tsk tsk about is that the movie doesn't take full advantage of the martial arts talents of Eastern icons Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li. Jet Li is particularly wasted, as his character is mostly camouflaged in CG effects. I'll yell it to the world, brother: Jet Li, being already a human highlight, does NOT need CG effects! At least, in THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM, Jet Li has a fantastic one-off with Jackie Chan. And it would've been nice if Yeoh's character, the immortal sorceress Zi Yuan, had been allowed a reunion moment with her dead General, but the film was too eager to get to the two undead armies engaging in the fighty fight already. It's also a bit ironic that TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR came out the same summer as the fourth Indiana Jones, of that franchise this Mummy series has strived to emulate (but never quite surpassed). And like THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, there's an annoying youngster trying to upstage the old bull. Luke Ford plays Rick and Evie's son Alex with the appeal of someone clinically dead. This guy has zero chemistry with absolutely everyone and everything in this film. I guess it's a truimph of sorts that I don't find Alex as exasperating as Shia LeBeouf's Mutt (don't get me started on that vine swinging %$##).

This one simply lacks the scale, romance and panache (okay, campy panache) of the first two Mummy films. Coming out the same summer as IRON MAN, HELLBOY 2, DARK KNIGHT and, dammit, yes, even MAMMA MIA, TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR never really stood a chance. Factor in the stale storytelling, the lame dialogue, Rachel Weisz's absence, and the misuse of Jet Li and, well, you can see why Weisz chose not to dig up her role again. As for Brendan Fraser, he's a nice guy but I wouldn't be surprised if he's up for sequels to MONKEYBONE or BEDAZZLED.",1230076800,,4672,4.643288996372431

The story was very brief and shallow.  The best part of the movie was that some parts were so bad that they became laughable.  Again, I am still a big fan of the first two.

3189132,2,B00004D2X8,"Seriously?  After the quirky fun and adventure of the 1st movie has the 3rd really been reduced to this?  Replacing Rachel Weisz with Maria whatever her name is was the first big blunder.  Her and Brenden Frasier just did NOT have the chemistry and she was so stiff!  And what about Alex?  What happened to the charming BRITISH kid?  This guy is so Americanized that he makes the normal American voice seem cultured.  Give me a break!  He's a stiff, stilted actor as well.

It's the same old plot but watered down.  Big discovery, wake mummy up, he wants to rule the world, he raises an army, Rick saves the day, the end.  I can't believe the only cast originals are Rick and Jonathan.  I hoped to see a return of some of our Egyptian friends, that they would be needed to bring the latest bad guy down.  What a bummer!

This movie is so full of corny one-liners too.  One of the worst is when Jonathan is on fire and yelling at Rick: ""Spank my..."" well, you get the idea.  The point is, they were trying WAY too hard here!  I like some of the special effects, like the emperor turning to clay and getting fired all at once, and the bronze horses are neat too.  I also like the terra cotta warriors.

But I wanted to see more of Shangri-la, or to see the witch see her lover for one moment.  Hey, if he was pulled to pieces, why was his mummy pretty much intact?  And why, oh why, does Brenden Frasier still look so HOT when he should be in his 50's?  The timeline is really messed up as the first mummy movie was in the 20's and this is now the mid-40's.  He should have aged, as Evie and Jonathan should have.

The whole thing was rushed too, and it all came together too conveniently.  They really didn't face any setbacks, and any attempted drama was too easily solved.  I'd prefer to think the story left off at the 2nd movie, which was certainly pushing it.  The Rock as a giant man/scorpion and the diagram on the wall of his pyramid telling how to kill him was really pushing the envelope as it was.  They pushed the envelope too far with this one, and they ""jumped the shark"" so to speak.",1229904000,,2097,4.2405063291139244

I really liked the first mummy movie.  I would probably give it a 4.5 out of 5.  I don't really remember the second one.  Guess I will have to watch it again one day.  But the new film fell short.  This time the movie is about Rick O' Connells son trying to fine treasure.  Then there's a warrior who had a curse put on him that made him and his army turn into statues.  There is a way to lift the curse though.  With the item that O' Connells sun is looking for.  If the people trying to awake the old emperor get the item, The man will awake with his army and try to rule the world.  Sound boring?  You got it.  As stupid as that sounds.  That is the movie.

There is a lot of martial arts in the film.  While I like martial arts movies as much as the next guy, it just didn't feel right in this film.  You'll be sitting there watching it and you will forget that your watching a movie about mummies.  On top of the martial arts feeling strange there is SO many things trying to be done at the same time that it starts to overwhelm you.  As soon as you start to understand something and get into it,  five more things happen that by the end will have made you forget all about the things you had started to understand.

Then the humor.  While a few things may have made me giggle, by no means did I bust out laughing.  All the laughter seemed like the same old stuff you've seen in the other mummy movies.  It seems to me that they tried to add to much humor in it.  I mean it is a movie about mummies trying to kill people and the world in danger of being over taken by a mad man who will kill anyone who wishes.  It's almost National Lampoonsish.  I know that seems strange but it is.  And maybe it's just me but Brendon Fraser always seems to be straining his voice, trying to make him self sound deeper than he is.  That may just be my ears letting me hear things that are not though.

In the end you get a movie that may have been good it is did not have a couple movies head of it.  Making people expect it to be a certain way.  But it does and we do.  As soon as you start watching it you will get the feeling that the makers had a lot more money than they have and they just wanted to make more.  It does not even have the same lady playing the wife.  I don't think the new lady (Maria Bello) who plays his wife, seems unable to act well in this role.  I have never seen her in anything I can remember so perhaps that is how she always acts.  But it seems strained to me.  If you really want to see this I would say rent it first.

3189142,2,B00004D2X8,"I'd have to agree with most of the other reviews on the quality of this movie.

I looked forward to seeing the third installment of ""The Mummy"" with anticipation, but was disappointed to the extent of taking a one day hiatus halfway through the film - it was that bad. The first two installments captivated me with a sense of adventure and were entertaining. This one just plain falls flat. While the introduction to the film was good enough, the rest lacked much of any kind of story which leaves the audience wondering what is happening and why.

First thing you'll notice is that Evie O'Connell is played by a different actress. The magic between Brendan Frazer and Rachel Weisz is missing to the point that (even though you know Maria Bello is supposed to be Evie) one asks, ""Who is this woman""?

Alex O'Connell is now a young adult and an adventurer in his own right. But where the second Mummy film showed us a tight knit family who would do anything for each other, Alex is now a rebel, Rick is a father who nags his son. Remember the lines from Mummy 2?

Rick: ""It isn't easy being a dad!""
Alex: ""No, but you do it real good.""

What happened to that relationship and support? This movie portrays a family who doesn't really seem to care a lot for each other and is in severe need of reconciliation. Really bad scripting. Drags the film into the ""B"" category for this tired old saw.

There is action here .... a LOT of action. But it doesn't hang together like the earlier releases. It just seems as if the writers looked for every reason to have lots of things going on to make up for a dramatic lack of story line.

Even Brendan Frazer seems tired with the role. His earlier spark as the pluck adventurer is gone and it seems as if he's saying mentally, ""here we go again. Kill the bad guy, save the world.""

The CGI and effects in the movie are nice and you won't be disappointed here. However, it takes more than just a bunch of special effects to make a good story.

Sorry guys; for as much as I liked the first two Mummy films and enjoyed Brendan Frazer in them, I have to give this movie a `thumbs down'. They should change the title to: ""Mummy 3: An Atrocious Continuance"". Two stars ... and I'm being generous. Recommended as a one time rental only.

First and most annoying: Rachel Weisz gets replaced by Maria Bella as Evie O'Shea, so much dissimilar that her initial appearance made me wonder who she was and why was she doing a Mummy Reading?

3189144,3,B00004D2X8,"Several years have passed since ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) have made some decent box-office outings. The second sequel (arguably the unneeded sequel)to the action-fantasy franchise has a different director at the helm, in the name of Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious). If the first two films were any indication, Stephen Sommers is indeed a good action director; he knows how to make the wide camera angle, doesn't rely on slow motion and knows how to make his actors look quite cool. Rob Cohen also has a good resume, but you can tell that Sommers' absence was felt, but the film does have that Sommers` pace. (Sommers is present as producer)

Thousands of years ago, an evil emperor who has mastered the mystic arts had the malevolent intentions to take over the entire world. Betrayed by his general (Russell Wong), and cursed by the beauteous witch, Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh), the evil emperor was buried under the sands of time. Now awakened by an ambitious military leader (Anthony Wong), it is up to Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello), together with their all-grown up son Alex (Luke Ford) and the mysterious Lin (Hong Kong's own Isabella Leong) to try to stop the second rise of the evil emperor and his army. Here we go again....

The film's plot is very simple and feels like a rehash of the first two installments. The script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar is mainly built around the action and is full of familiar plot elements that it offers no surprises. While it's not exactly a lost cause, since there are some new additions to the screenplay that helped it out--(the Tibetan CGI kindly Abominable Snowmen, subtle doses of humor, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh) the film does lack a good dose of emotions. The father and son relationship offers nothing we haven't seen before, the bored ""retired"" adventurers gimmick, and the awakening of the two armies of the dead to oppose each other has been done numerous times.

The performances by the cast is good for the most part. Brendan Fraser is in familiar territory and Maria Bello (who takes over the sorely missed Rachel Weisz's role) does a convincing English woman. The two do have chemistry but they have so little to work with and they look too young and unconvincing to have a grown-up son. Speaking of chemistry, there are no sparks between Luke Ford and beauteous Isabella Leong, their time together onscreen falls flat. Leong is a capable actress (as proven in her Asian films) but her character is so severely underdeveloped along with Michelle Yeoh`s. Which is such a pity since Lin and Zi Yuan are the most interesting characters in the film. This would be difficult to do, since they may steal the spotlight from Rick and Evy, but the film would have stayed aloft if their characters took on more than supporting roles. Jet Li had limited screen time but he does still have that charisma that catches your eye, Li can act and fit's the role of the emperor. However, to hamper the actors further, the dialogue of the film is VERY clichd that it proved a little empty. I did say that there were subtle bits of humor that helped a little but I didn't say they were original.

Thankfully, the action sequences were entertaining to watch. The film has some nicely placed scenes of action, the shots are ""spiffy"" and the CGI effects, while not the best we've seen are quite good. Although the use of effects are somewhat clichd also. Water and ice effects, wind and fire, there's even a nice looking three headed dragon and the snowmen, armies of the dead--all good but not groundbreaking. The fights were good but not great, this is the part that you feel that it was fluid enough but it could have been better. I missed Stephen Sommers even though Rob Cohen did an acceptable job I think.

In closing, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is fun enough on the entertainment factor but it just feels a little flat. The action sequences were good but without the proper set up and emotions, the action felt like it was a simple excuse to delay the film's outcome. The film is so predictable that it throws its punches too soon and it overlooked several details that the story itself was also underdeveloped and full of holes. The film isn't as good or as entertaining as the first two films, but thankfully, it wasn't much, much worst.

3189145,4,B00004D2X8,"It's 1947 and the O'Connell's have retired.  Rick (Brendan Fraser) is trying to take up fly fishing.  And Evelyn (Maria Bello) has a case of writer's block trying to come up with a third book to follow her two best sellers based on their two adventures with mummies.  Truthfully, the two are bored out of their minds.  Which is why they are thrilled to be offered a chance to take a rare artifact to China.

The trip also gives them a chance to visit Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) who owns an Egyptian themed nightclub called ""Imhotep.""

Unbeknownst to them, it's also the current location of their grown son Alex (Luke Ford.)  Alex has just uncovered the ancient burial ground of Emperor Han (Jet Li) an ancient Chinese Emperor who, if awakened, will attempt to take over the world.

Naturally, the next thing anyone knows, the emperor is awake.  Can the O'Connell family figure out a way to stop their latest mummy?

This movie doesn't have the atmosphere the first one did.  There just isn't the sense of foreboding the permeates the entire thing.  And the story is predictable, especially if you've seen the first two.

But it is fun.  There are some great action sequences and impressive fights.  The special effects are top notch yet never feel like they get in the way of the story.  And there are several laughs.  The best were in the previews, but my favorite involved our first shot of Evelyn, played here by a different actress then the first two.

My only real problem was a rather significant plot hole.  At least I think there was one.  The story was moving so fast that either they forgot something major or explained it to us but I missed it.

No, this is not great cinema.  But it really isn't trying to be.  It's a fun way to kill a couple of hours, and if that is what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed.",1229644800,,1845,4.507552870090635
3189146,3,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy movies are tributes to Spielberg, who doesn't deserve any tributes.  The ""funny"" lines, the overblown soundtrack, the unbelievable plots - its all a bunch of rubbish.

But I watch Mummy movies to see the latest in special effects - not just the monsters - but the amazing locations and sets that are largely created digitally.  These movies are wonderful if you enjoy this as a means to its own end.  Some movies are star vehicles, the Mummy movies are special effects vehicles.  This one has some great stuff: Shangrai La, Abominable Snowmen and a terra cotta army of mummy's.  The film is also very well filmed and always looks very crisp and colorful.

On a casting note: Maria Bella is too classy to be Fraser's wife, and not sassy enough for the role.  Luke Ford is a disaster as Fraser's son.  He sounds like a hood from the Departed and is generally hard to like during the picture.  If they are thinking of this guy for his own movies, they need to back off the herb for a while.

Don't get me wrong she is an awesome actress but not for this kind of genre. The whole movie is a bit of this a bit of that and you always ask yourself when will it be over. I think the whole franchise is like a worn out shoe so hopefully it will be over forever.

3189148,4,B00004D2X8,"""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is a spectacular, all out action film that takes viewers into the heart of China to witness the battle between the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) and Rick O'Connell (Fraser.  Storywise, the film synopsis says it best.

Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick O'Connell in an epic adventure that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Along with his son Alex (Luke Ford), wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), he must stop a mummy awakened from a 2,000-year-old curse from enslaving the world.  Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress (Michelle Yeoh) to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) and his 10,000 warriors have lain forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. When dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, he turns to the only people he can think of with the skill and knowledge to combat the undead: his parents. But the Emperor's quest for world domination has only intensified during his imprisonment and, with unimaginable supernatural powers and a legion of Terra Cotta Warriors at his command, the Emperor Mummy could be an unstoppable force--unless the O'Connells can vanquish him first.

This film, just like the previous three, is pure escapism. While the first film drew on the Mummy (Bram Stoker), this entry is more original but more monumental in its' scope.  The special effects are good, and there is Fraser, charming as always yet he manages to escape and pull off the near impossible.

Don't watch it for history, watch it for fun.

If you manage to have the blu-ray version, the special features rock!

3189149,3,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is pretty self explanatory.  If you've seen any ""Mummy"" movie, you'll know that it takes a straightforward plot; you get a back story of how said mummy becomes that way, his rise from the dead, and then it's up to the O'Connell's to send that mummy back to where he came from.

There are some familiar faces in ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", Brendan Fraser reprises his role of Rick O'Connell and John Hannah returns as Jonathan.  Then you have Maria Bello replacing Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Luke Ford assuming the role of a much older Alex O'Connell.  This actor switch is where the minor irregularities come in.  Bello's replacement of Weisz is very noticeable and her British accent needs a lot of work.  And Ford's portrayal of the older Alex is sans the British accent he had in the second film.  Again, they are minor flaws, but flaws nonetheless.

Everything else was pretty much the same as any of the other two ""Mummy"" films.  You had car chases, airborne chases, plenty of shooting, tidbits of humor, lots and lots of mummies, and the same old ending.  ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" doesn't break new ground, but if you enjoyed any other film in the trilogy, you'll like this one.  It's not as good as the first, but much better than the second.  Crack open the sarcophagus and give the mummy one more shot at world domination, but let's just hope that in the end he'll stay in the tomb.  3.5 out of 5.",1229558400,,1452,4.4961832061068705

She isn't as hot as the other lady. This one looks kind of decrepit and is annoying just like a real mummy. I guess that's part of the genius of this film, Frazier is not only fighting a mummy, he is married to one as well. I guess film critics call this ""symbolism"".

3189154,3,B00004D2X8,"Like many who saw it, I had high hopes for this movie, but low expectations. The fact is that franchises tend to get weaker over time (with few exception), and the Mummy is no different. The fact is that this film had so much freakin potential, and the filmmakers just let the opportunity fall through to a mediocre summer fun film.

The movie has a good number of breakdowns, one of which is the acting. Brendon Fraser brings a weakened performance to the table this time around. Whatever used to be there for him just wasn't there now. The new Mrs. O'Connel, Maria Bello, just wasn't doing it for me. I think she's a good actress, but I don't think she was right for the part. She made the character much more tame and motherly then Rachel Wiesz had portrayed her. Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh do an OK job, but they had only but so much to work with. Both characters seemed very hallow, especially Li's character as the Dragon Emperor. After he was sealed away, it seemed like there was no real reason for him to be alive. He himself even asks ""why did you raise me?"" The sad thing is that the Dragon Emperor had such potential to be an awesome villain, even worse them Imhotep. I mean the guy could control most of the elements, and he did it pretty well (though they could have got more creative with that as well). It just wasn't all that great.

The other let down was the action. Like i said, mediocre at best. It was an ok action flick, but i was so very disappointed in the battle at the end, especially with Yoeh and Li's very brief duel. It was so badly choreographed and ultimately pointless, a true waste of two martial artist actors. The only time when the action looked good is when CGI was involved; i.e. when the Emperor's army fights the dead soldiers from under the wall.

Bottom line, don't go into this thinking its another Mummy Returns. Imhotep is dead for good (they make sure to say so in the film) and the Dragon Emperor is here for the moment. A good movie for a rental, cuz it is a fun movie, I just wouldn't recommend buying it unless your into collecting for the trilogy.

Simply put, I enjoyed this,its a roller coaster movie.
Is it as good as the first 2 Mummy movies? No, when are sequels better than originals - not too often.
Is this any good ? Yes. Its a fun ride for 100 minutes. This time it's a Mummy from Shangri-La. There are some cool CGI SPFX -of monsters and Yeti and the action is more or less non stop. Jet Li becoming a 3 headed dragon and some other monster is very cool, the SPFX were great here. It is the same formula as the first 2 Mummy movies, witty dialog (some of the lines come up short) and just a lot of explosions and effects. The acting is perfectly fine for a movie like this. The love interest is non existent. It doesn't need to be the big story in this kind of movie. This is a movie that is meant to entertain you with action and effects, not to be a downer with a sad ending, not about love. The characters were all good enough for this kind of picture. And boy does this deliver, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It did what it set out to do entertain you with non stop action- 4 stars for a movie of this sort. Leave your brains at the door when you watch this, this is just to sit back and enjoy.
These movies remind me so much of Indiana Jones that I wish Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser would team up to fight a Mummy with a treasure thrown in.

I am one of the biggest fans of the previous two movies. I even liked part two where people were ready to string the director up by his toenails for releasing such a thing. But this one?...oh my. Horrible! I really thought that Jet Li would ruin the flick but he was very good. It was the main actors that ruined it.

3189160,2,B00004D2X8,"Arguably a miserable film, but what a heck of a BD.

First off, this was tested on several players (Sony, Samsung, and PS3) and with the amount of menu navigation and options imposed upon screen pics - your player needs to be in perfect shape. The victor was the PS3 for seamless navigations and wait times.

The picture looked adequate almost to a fault on some of the special effects sequences. There are plenty of chances to test your white balance and motion blur with black/dark backdrops. The sound was enjoyable with the DTS, but you must have your system set up just right for a film like this as the highs can drown out some of the dialogue mix/music mash (so a solo HDTV will not sound as good obviously).

What makes this fun is the special features though. There are hours upon hours of extras to utilize, whether you watch them during the pic or by themselves. The two main docus are very informative on the production and are worth the watch. If anything, watch the Terra Cotta docu when Cohen gets a nice slam on Disney vs. real Chinese cultural history. The amount of ""I love working with (fill in the blank)"" gets sickening, especially with Fraser's high on something look in his interviews. The deleted scenes were thankfully removed from the film (11 minutes).

The replacement of a main character is never easy and in this case I think they should have waited to make the movie until Wiesz was available. Her replacement, Maria Bello, did not show the special personality quirks, warmth, and depth that endeared us to Wiesz in the first two movies. The movie is a fair action sequel with lots of great scenes of fighting, but it feels strained and misses the fun of the first two. So if you want just action without the warmth of love exhibited in the first two you will probably not be disappointed. In this sequel the O'Connells, lead by their son Alex, fight a risen Chinese emperor. They endeavor to stop him from becoming immortal and raising his army. This feat requires enlisting the aid of a beautiful woman that has guarded the emperors tomb and a pool at Shagri La for centuries. She calls upon abominable snowmen and those killed by the emperor to assist them but the emperor controls all the elements and is a formidable opponent. Well worth at least a rental even with the absence of Wiesz. I bought it because I like the series, I just wish they had kept the same crew. If you enjoyed this catch ""Wanted"".

Even better, Michelle Yeoh is in this film as well, playing a Chinese princess who mixes it up with the mummy.

So why is this film not a five-star hit? I blame the director: Rob Cohen. Stephen Sommers directed the first two Mummy films, they were a fresh, fun re-works of the old Mummy movies. Those films had some punch to them, a ""big"" scope and the pacing was just right. This film has Yetis, explosions, mummies (two, count 'em, two mummy armies!), dragons, monsters and a big battle scene at the end but it is not put together very well. This film is alot like the director last few movies: Stealth, The Skulls, xXx. The Mummy 3 has the same video game elements as these films. Too much was thrown into this film: The Mummy has magic powers AND he can fight like Jet Li AND he can turn into a dragon AND he can turn into a giant Yeti AND....

I missed seeing this in a theatre, it was playing in movie houses for such a short time - that should tell you something.

The Mummy 3 is not a terrible film, I liked parts of it enough for 3 stars. I've seen worse. But don't expect to see something better than the first 2 Mummy pictures..",1229299200,,1429,4.208029197080292

Bello and Fraser are joined by their son, Alex (Luke Ford). Ford is miscast, too close in age to Fraser and their relationship is clich&eacute; (Indiana Jones, for example, used that particular plot device twice). Additionally, Alex and Lin (Isabella Leong) share little chemistry.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor marks an anniversary of sorts for Jet Li, who played the bad guy in the sloppy sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon-4/dp/0790738953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon 4</a>, ten years ago. Most moviegoers in 1998 hadn't yet witnessed Jet Li's martial art skills. Riggs and Murtaugh were tired and bloated but Jet Li almost single-handedly made Lethal Weapon 4 worth watching.

This time around, not even Jet Li can save the sequel.

There are as many reasons as plot holes why this sequel doesn't charm like the original, even allowing for the absent logic on which popcorn movies thrive. Haven't had enough exploding CGI mummies? Well, this is your movie. Besides, the international box office for Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ensures another sequel in a couple years (and don't be surprised if the O'Connell family shows up in South America).",1229299200,,3063,8.467492260061919
3189165,4,B00004D2X8,"First of all, let it be said that everything about this Blu-ray version of ""MUMMY: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""is technically superb -- the visual quality of the movie, the rich sound and the significant extras.

For home theater aficionados, watching this film on a full hi-def plasma or LCD, it actually looks better than it did in the theater.

But what about the movie itself?  The movie did OK at the box office ($100 M domestic and nearly $400M international), but there are many who have not seen it because the reviews (including many posted here) were weak.  So let's reconsider the movie itself.

Many of the theatrical reviewers missed the point of this whopping, exotic adventure and a portion of the potential audience stayed away from this ultimate popcorn flick.  Now the hi-def disc offers another chance to experience and yes, enjoy, this fine escapist entertainment that's also state-of-the-art filmmaking.

The Blu-ray version delivers an extraordinary-looking transfer of this exotic action adventure that lives up to the whopping premise of the title, which is: when a curse is broken, the 2,200 year old Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) is revived along with his horde of 10,000 warriors, no longer terra cotta tombmates!  And Rick O'Connell must stop them from enslaving the world.

This latest incarnation of the reborn mummy franchise is in every way an homage to the very best of the 1930s and 40s Saturday serials, and it is done on a huge scale that perfectly fits its story.  Yes it's over-the-top.  But that's the whole point.  It always respects the audience (unlike the ""Matrix""or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""sequels), and it is far superior to the dreadful ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" misadventure.

This is NOT a movie about plot so much as it is about the ride. And what a globe trotting ride it is.  How can you not love a movie that has fanaticized Chinese soldiers, an army of undead royal bodyguards, risen mummified bodies of unnumbered of oppressed (buried under the Great Wall) as well as fierce Yetis.  Yes, abominable snowmen.  And they are good guys!

Brendan Fraser is just right as Rick ""Mummy Hunter"" O'Connell who races from the catacombs of ancient China to a frigid redoubt in the high Himalayas.  Maria Bello is terrific as his Rick's wife Evelyn (Rachel Weisz opted to not return to the series).  Bello obviously loves this kind of rough and tumble action character,.  Michelle Yeoh is a cool charismatic screen presence as a double-crossing sorceress.

Rob Cohen is a genius with this material.  His visual commentary (you can watch the movie with him) is revealing and free-form.  He talks about the making of the movie of course as well as everything from President Elect Obama to his own practice of Buddhism.

If you're looking for serious, intimate epics in the vein of David Lean, forget it.  But if you want to feel like a 12 year old in the best way, don't miss this adventure that never lets up.  The scope and detail of the production design is superb.  And for the most part accurate for the period portrayed.

The extras are generous.  I loved the ""making of"" featurette and the Blu-ray option that enables the viewer to collect favorite scenes and share in the on-line community.

Give this extravagant and fun flick another chance.  Highly recommended for what it is.  A big, wild ride.",1229212800,,3356,4.833333333333333

3189167,5,B00004D2X8,"There are a few reviewers who have said that these movies are great escapism, they're not meant to be taken seriously nor are the characters. The characters seem to be mere extensions of the old action movie clichs of the past with Brendan Fraser being the tough talking action hero, and John Hannah being the wimpy slimeball who always survives thanks to the heroes. I have to be thruthful and say I've never watched the first two Mummy movies in their entirety, I have only caught them either at the middle or the end but I have loved every bit I've seen.

Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'm guessing is set a few years after the last Mummy movie due to their son Alex now being about 25. Alex is now an explorer and is in search of the tomb of Dragon Emperor Han. He finds it but finds he's being pursued by Chinese soldiers wanting to bring the frozen emperor back to life so that he can bring China back to greatness. Alex's parents the legendary Richard and Evelyn O'connell are employed by the British government to take the ancient Chinese relic The Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a sign of good will. Unfortunately not all goes to plan and the Eye is stolen and used to awaken the emperor by General Yang.

Over the course of the film after the emperors awakening follows a number of fast paced action scenes, very well choreographed fighting and some stellar special effects. The Mummy films have always been known for their epic size in particular scenes including the massive battles that usually take place near the end. This film is no exception to that rule and seeks to push the epic size further and further. The look of the Emperor before he takes back his human form is shockingly realistic, the CGI chase scene blended with the real life chasers is amazing and flawless. The acting I have to be honest is a bit ""meh"" but you don't watch such a movie expecting 5 star acting, yet I so want Brendan Fraser to come out with some excellent acting talent.

I would highly recommend this to all fans of the Mummy movies as it keeps true to the original style and feel of the past ones. The special effects are amazing and the movie is made all the more special by Fraser being his usual awesome self.",1229040000,,2214,4.421568627450981

Rick and Evie must stop him before he brings back his army and destroys the world. Alex falls in love with a witch's daughter who is immortal.

SFX are first rate...the visuals are stunning.
The action and fight sequences are captivating.
The acting is good...yes the characters are sometimes silly, but that is what makes these Mummy movies so endearing. Its the comedy stupid! These movies are meant to be fun and entertaining, an escape from reality. And Tomb of the Dragon Emperor delivers!

3189176,1,B00004D2X8,"Everything about this movie is screwed up.
The Director: Replacing Stephen Sommers with Rob Cohen was the biggest mistake. I can understand if Mr. Sommers refused to direct this movie once he finished reading the script.

The Casts: Rachel Weiz replaced with Maria Bello makes the Evelyn character dull: the joke, the magic conection between Rick and Evelyn as in the prevous 2 movies is lost, I don't know why Rachel refused this project, but I think she made a very smart decision.
Luke Ford, indeed is too old to played the son, he looks more like a brother to Brendan Fraser.

The Talents: A waste of talents, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh can do more than that, yet the director didn't maximize their talents.
Maria Bello tried so hard to play Evelyn character, but failed. I think she was a great actress, but after seeing her in this movie I changed my mind.

The Visual Effects: A westerner director made an oriental dragon = screwed up in every way, a chinesse dragon doesn't look like that! find an art director who did a research first before creating a movie.

The Script: (Warning: contain spoiler) The story is so stupid and awfull, that is insulted our mind and logic. The biggest joke is when a mummy who can change into an indestructible flying dragon had to change into a flightless beast, and then change back to a human, so that he can be killed by his enemy. Ridiculous!

Then the moments between Frazier and his son, also replaced for this movie, were hard to stomach, let alone seem believable.

Brendan Frazier maintains one tone of voice throughout-- irritated and loud. Maria Bello as Evie is too ""suave"" with none of the endearing clumsiness of Rachel Weisz, and it looks as though she and Fraser can barely stand to be near each other much less be married. There is a hackneyed theme of their grown son being estranged from his parents, which is totally at odds with the second movie.

It starts with the O'Connells living in a castle in England, retired now after a life time of action and adventure. They are asked by the British government to transport a rare jewel that belongs to the Chinese people, which is supposed to be the Eye of Shangri-la.
Their son, who is all grown up now to be picking up women at his Uncle Jonathan's nightclub in Shangai, gets into another adventure of his own when the entire fanmily inadvertently (is there any other way) awake the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) from his stony slumber and after that all hell pretty much breaks loose.
I'd leave it to your imagination as to what transpires. But rest assured, this is the weakest in the entire Mummy series and some disappointing performance by none other than Brendan Fraser (act like your 47, man!) and surprisingly Jet Li.

3189195,1,B00004D2X8,"to my personal taste, mummy 1 was marvelous and mummy 2 was awesome. not only because of their scripts and the stories, but also due to the colors added to the characters by the actors and actresses. beautiful, cute, naive, yet determined Rachel Weisz, humorous and funny but a hardcore adventurer Brendan Fraser and a bit gutless but good-hearted John Hannah. these people were the main taste of the two movies of the series. now, the personality of Rachel Weisz, thus the color that she added to the movie was removed and a totally new and opposite, colorless, cold and hollow character was embedded for the same role, leading the result to a missing leg of the trivet, and a sour taste in the mouth.

the script is another disaster:
- for no reason, Jonathan runs a night club in China, which has almost no effect on the progress of the events.

- the story is totally monotonous, boring, perfunctory, a bit copycat smelling and includes no creativity or lacks new ideas that previous series did (like the rocket-boosted balloon-ship in Mummy 1 or a reincarnated lover who tries to resurrect her partner in Mummy 2).

- i also, did not understand why the evil general, who has the intention of serving the emperor to seize the whole world, has an ""army"" of a size less than a squadron, formed by less trained, dumb looking soldiers, living in tents settled in the middle of nowhere, with only armament of two motorcycles, one 4x4 vehicle and one AA-gun (because only this much equipment is needed in the coming scenes).

- the scene that rick and alex has a conversation to show off their knowledge on weapons, as a father - son conflict thing, is a complete rubbish, timeless and unnecessary. how can anyone imagine two characters wasting their time for such a conversation while they have to form a line of defense against the approaching enemy?

- the idea of destroying the tower holding the seat of the diamond which will pinpoint the hidden gates with explosives is a complete nonsense, because they do not need to destroy the whole tower, but only the seat. they can achieve this goal easily by firing some rounds at the seat itself.

i am not even commenting on the cheap ideas of Chinese soldier's uniforms inspired by German uniforms of WWII, or Hitler looking face of the terracota, yet alive emperor, just before he restores his broken shape.

my conclusion: this movie does not worth the money, it is not a part of Mummy series but it is a total killer of the reputation of the series itself. i cannot imagine a Mummy 4 after this failure.",1225324800,,2555,4.626931567328918
3189196,3,B00004D2X8,"We saw this at a bargain theater for $2 a ticket. Its okay, but not fabulous. I think fans of the first Mummy film won't really enjoy this one as much. Maybe it just loses something when its not in Egypt. Some people might like it a lot. I had low expectations going in so I thought it was worth 3 stars (I was only counting on one or two). The effects are pretty good and the costumes are nice. The acting isn't Oscar material, but neither was the original. To be honest, if we buy this on DVD it will be after its been out a while and we can get a used copy fairly cheap. You might want to rent it before you commit to buying it at the ""new"" price. Its not a terrible movie, but probably not top of the pile either.",1225238400,,717,3.9178082191780823

It's up to the intrepid trio -- with a little help from their friends -- to set things right before the Mummy destroys the world.  You've got a good deal of action and adventure with some serious romance thrown in, too.

3189209,1,B00004D2X8,I got this about a month ago and also had bought The Mummy Returns.  I just got a HD DVD player in Feb. and it won't play on it or any other I have in the house.

3189210,3,B00004D2X8,"The movie looks great. However, there are a couple of curious and annoying issues.
1. The PS3 had an update a few months ago which gave the machine the capability of ""remembering"" where the viewer left off (stopping the disc or even removing it). Upon restarting the disc, it would pick up at that point. This disc does not respond to that useful feature. You have to noodle your way through the film to find where you left off.
2. Sometimes I like to freeze the frame and enjoy a moment in the cinematography, or perhaps play a portion in slo-mo. This disc has a pop-up ""slider bar"" which shows you where you are in the time line of the film. This thing appears whenever you activate Pause, etc. The feature seems to be unavoidable and I find it quite annoying. This a case where, IMHO, the Blu-ray ""bells and whistles"" are out of control.",1217376000,,840,4.425806451612903

The trouble is that Sony had notified me in the past about such upgraded firmware and they didn't this time.

3189215,5,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" receives a very nice look Blu-ray transfer for this new edition of the movie. Capturing the adventurous elements of films like ""Indiana Jones"" and injecting it into the basic story for the 1932 film ""The Mummy"", Stephen Sommers creates a terrific, enteraining film. For those interested in a synposis of the plot, I'll provide it at the end of the review because you've probably already seen this.

The Blu-ray transfer looks quite good here with bold colors that more closely recall the original theatrical presentation than the DVD. The image is crisp and while there's evidently some digital noise reduction applied, Universal hasn't completely cleaned away all the film grain which is a good thing because when that's done you actually lose sharpness and clarity (it is restored with a loss of detail via Edge Enhancement like the recent reissue of ""Patton"" which went overboard with digitally cleaning up the film). The best thing that Universal could have done here was to leave the grain intact and dispense with the Edge Enhancement. I suspect that the same source was used for the Blu-ray as was used for the HD-DVD edition but that the Edge Enhancement is more transparent here because of higher resolution.

What does all of that mean? The film looks extremely good but could look brilliant. Still, on the whole this looks much better than the DVD edition.

The extras are still presented in 480p (which is standard DVD definition)so be aware those haven't been updated. However, Universal has made this a U-Control disc where you can customize the extras as you watch the film (something developed for and carried over from HD-DVD). You do get the ability to watch the visual commentary/extras while watching the film. All of the original extras from the DVD have been ported over for this edition. All of the extras and the film are on the single disc edition here (unlike the DVD which has most of the extras on a second disc).

Followed by the equally entertaining (and much bigger production of) ""The Mummy Returns"" and a fun entertaining (if lesser)spin-off film ""The Scorpion King"", ""The Mummy"" is worth picking up again even if you have the original DVD edition. Highly recommended.

Oh, and the plot? A group of explorers led by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)and Rick (Brendan Fraiser)rush to find the riches of an Egyptian tomb and end up reviving Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo)an Egyptian High Priest buried alive for his part in a conspiracy to kill the Pharoah. Brought back by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Im-Ho-Tep takes revenge on those who plundered his tomb and seeks the Book of the Dead to bring back his beloved princess who helped him kill the Pharoah.

3189218,5,B00004D2X8,"This was such a fun movie to watch. I can remember when I first heard Brendan Fraser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-of-the-Jungle/dp/6304711867/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George of the Jungle</a>) was starring in it I questioned whether I wanted to see it but I am SO glad I did. As good as it is on a small screen it was outstanding to watch on the large. Even though it's barely over two hours you almost left the theater exhausted.

Fraser plays fortune hunter Rick O'Connell, a man motivated by treasure but also very loyal to his friends & partners. Rachel Weisz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Constant-Gardener-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000C65Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Constant Gardener (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays Evie, a librarian whose specialty is ancient Egyptian artifacts. John Hannah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sliding-Doors/dp/6305210411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sliding Doors</a>) plays her brother Jonathan, a less than scrupulous want-to-be archeologist/fortune-hunter who, contrary to a review in the New Yorker Magazine, is not a ""dim but cowardly..."" character. To me, Hannah's portrayal of Jonathan is one of the surprising gems of the film. Always looking for the quick-fix but willing to stand up for his sister. But the one character that steals almost every scene he's in is Arnold Vosloo's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Diamond-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000MZHW40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Diamond (Widescreen Edition)</a>) ""Imhotep"", otherwise known as the mummy.

The premise is Evie (with a little not-so-legal help from her brother) discovers the location of the lost treasure city of Hamunaptra. Upon arriving she reads from the ""book of the dead"", releasing the mummy, who plans to resurrect his lost love and then pretty much rain disaster over the whole world. And of course, he needs to sacrifice Evie to do it. It's up to O'Connell & Jonathan with help from a descendent of the ancient Pharaoh guards to rescue her and kill the Mummy before he can unleash his terror.

There are many things to like here. The actors play off each other wonderfully. The plot, while hokey at times is a blast to follow, especially because the filmmakers never take it too seriously. The special effects are outstanding, not only for 1999 standards, but holds up well even now. And the soundtrack is a perfect fit, never over-powering a scene. Overall, just a great film to escape into for two hours.

Unfortunately, the sequel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-Returns-HD-DVD/dp/B000KN7BIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy Returns [HD DVD</a>]) never lived up to this film. Although it used the same blueprint, the plot quickly slipped from unbelievable (OK for this type of film) to ludicrous (a death sentence). But with the new film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-Tomb-of-the-Dragon-Emperor-Blu-ray/dp/B0018C9H1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  [Blu-ray</a>]) being released this summer I am hopeful for a return to greatness, or at least a return to enjoyability. My only reservation is that Rachel Wiesz was unable to reprise her role as Evie. Let's hope her replacement, Maria Bello (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Trade-Center-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000JLTRKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)</a>), is as good.",1215302400,,3648,6.704016913319239

Director Stephen Sommers and Editor Bob Ducsay break the movie down scene-by-scene better than any of the others I've watched and give you a real feel for what it's like to direct a big-budget movie filled with computer-generated effects.

3189222,4,B00004D2X8,"When it comes to remakes of classic films, I usually just don't bother. However, the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"" is a remake in the loosest of terms. The only thing that the two stories really have in common are the central plot points of a priest of ancient Egypt who has been executed for commiting the blasphemy of attempting to raise the dead, the priest being brought back to life in the 1920's, and the priest (the mummy) then seeing a 20th century girl as the physical likeness of the Egyptian girl for which he was buried alive thousands of years before. Everything else has been changed to appeal to modern audiences and give license to the special effects team, including the fact that the hero in this story is a ne'er do well versus the English gentleman who is the protagonist in the 1932 film. Here the mummy pursues the girl with supernatural physical powers he has been given upon his resurrection. In the 1932 film the mummy and the modern girl have a psychic connection since it is implied she actually is the reincarnated princess that he loved thousands of years before.

Of course, this movie has Imhotep receiving all of these special powers upon his resurrection so many cool special effects can be demonstrated, but I was left wondering - If the threat of his resurrection is left hanging over the heads of the Pharoah's bodyguards and their descendents for all eternity, wouldn't it have been smarter just to kill him in the first place and bypass the living death to which they sentenced him?

Since so much of the plot has been changed, this movie actually does work as a combination adventure film and screwball comedy versus the horror film for which it was named. Nothing beats the original, though, in my humble opinion.",1209772800,,1751,4.663430420711974

3189227,4,B00004D2X8,"This tale includes imaginative effects such as mummies coming to life while still mummies, gradually becoming fleshed-out again, and taking the flesh of others to complete the process. The mummies are also capable of causing and leading sandstorms against their adversaries. The figures present in hieroglyphics can come alive and step out of them.  Dung beetles are presented as vicious, flesh-eating beetles that crawl under the skin of their victims, and attack in hordes. Magic incantations, when read out of a secret book, can change everything.

Three thousand years ago, an Egyptian priest touched a woman who belonged to the pharaoh. The priest was punished by getting embalmed alive, with flesh-eating beetles devouring his flesh. The pharaoh's wealth was hidden in the area, and it became the subject of centuries of speculation, storytelling, and efforts to locate it.

The protagonists of this story manage to find the hidden city (Hamunaptra), which has long been dismissed as fantasy. The stories about pharaoh's wealth are also true. But then they have to tangle with the mummy of the long-ago slain priest who takes their flesh in his efforts to become a fleshed-out human once again.

I had never seen this movie before so I can't really compare to the standard version but this HD-DVD is a great representation of where this technology can take us.  The colors are very vivid, especially in the outdoor scenes where the sand looks incredible.  I didn't catch any lack of detail throughout the film and was very impressed with this transfer.

Sound:
The audio for this movie really helped the experience.  At certain points I felt as though I were truly in the film and as battles were sweeping across the screen the sword fighting with its clangs and clinks really hit home.  A nice surround sound setup will do this movie the justice it deserves.

Movie:
I'm not really sure how I managed to let this movie (and it's sequel) slip past me for the last few years, but I am glad I picked this one up.  The story-line was easy to follow but not simplistic, I didn't really feel as though there was much slow down as most of the film is action packed.

Overall:
If you don't already have this film or want to see it in all it's high definition glory, I would definitely recommend this film.  Make sure you have an HDTV and HD-DVD player, along with at least a 5.1 surround sound system.",1199145600,,1207,4.425339366515837

The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weise is a rousing remake of the 1932 horror film classic which had some people who are innocently exploring the Sahara Desert,  unwittingly releasing a priest who had defiled Pharaoh's woman.  This priest is buried alive without his ""vital organs"" ( I didn't know you could still be alive without your ""vital organs"").  Roaches or some type of bugs are, also, buried with him.  Remember the bugs.  This priest is inadvertently awaken and goes around trying to collect the vital organs of his human contacts.  One by one the priest acquires these ""vital organs"".

This movie has the flavor of the Indiana Jones movies, music, characters, etc.  It could easily have been called ""Indiana Jones and the Lost Sarcophagus, but that would have landed the makers in court for a copyright infringement.

Highly recommended for the Indiana Jones aficionada.

3189233,4,B00004D2X8,"1999's ""The Mummy"" is a well-done throw-back to an earlier age of movie-making with its monsters, heroes, and damsels in distress.  The 1932 horror classic featuring Boris Karloff gets a thrilling remake with a strong cast headed by Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Voslo, and John Hannah, much enhanced by the latest in computer-generated imagery.

The movie opens with the story of Imhotep (a nicely menacing Arnold Voslo), an Egyptian priest caught by the Pharoah violating one of his concubines.  Imhotep's murder of the Pharoah draws him the horrible living death of entombment in a coffin full of flesh-eating bugs, at Hamanatra, the City of the Dead.

The story flashes forward to a French Foreign Legion unit under attack by Arab raiders at the same location a few millenia later. The leader of the Legionaires, an American named Rick O'Connell (played with suitable swagger by Brendan Fraser) survives the massacre and escapes across the desert.

The story jumps now to a museum in Cairo, where Evie (played with equal parts brains and klutziness by Rachel Weisz), a female Egyptologist, is researching the mysteries of the now legendary Hamanatra.  Her never-do-well, cowardly, but likeable brother Jonathan (John Hannah) surfaces with an artifact that is the key to the mystery.  The two decide to find the City of the Dead.

Rachel hires Rick to guide them across the desert, after first rescuing him from the hangman's noose in a Cairo jail.  The three, accompanied by Rick's erstwhile jailer, travel by river steamer and camel, racing a competing team of archeologists and tracked by a mysterious group of avengers who seek to prevent them from reaching Hamanatra.  At Hamanatra, our heroes uncover the ""Book of the Dead"" and accidentally resurrect Imhotep.  The stage is set for a wild series of adventures, as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan are pursued back to Cairo by Imhotep, then must follow him back to Hamanatra to rescue Evie.

The movie manages to be a nice combination of thrilling action broken up by moments of comedy.  Much of the story is a tongue-in-cheek homage to earlier adventure classics.  If the dialogue is sometimes cliched, the action steps along quickly enough to avoid boring the viewer.  The sets are authentic looking, and the movie score nicely accents the action.

This movie is highly recommended as first rate entertainment.  This DVD version has some nice extra features on the special effects and Egyptology 101.",1194652800,,2459,5.062034739454094
3189234,5,B00004D2X8,"I love all things ""Egyptian"" and was definitely excited to watch this when it came out. It was so entertaining that I got the DVD. I love this movie. It's NOT supposed to be taken seriously, so all those that gave it a 1-3 star need to loosen up and wake up (literally they do, because some said they fell asleep watching this?!!) This movie is the essence of what you call ""escapism."" It helps you escape from life, plain & simple. It's full of action, comedy, duels, suspense, and adventure. The 2nd one in my opinion is better in some ways, like in terms of writing, and there is much more substance, but to me the original is always the best. The difference between the 1st and 2nd is this one is funnier, while the 2nd has better action & adventure. If you're feeling down & need laughs, bored and need excitement, or have a movie night with family and/or friends, this is the perfect movie for you. Yes, it can dip into being a bit corny, but that does not diminish it's humor, excitement, and adventure. I couldn't agree more with Amazon's review by Jenny Brown. She says, ""If outrageous effects, a hunky hero, and some hearty laughs are what you're looking for, the 1999 version of The Mummy is spectacularly good fun."" And ""When that action gets going, hold tight--those two hours just fly by."" And even though Anthony Lane of ""The New Yorker"" did not have much kind words for it, he was intelligent enough to notice how good Brendan Fraser is in it, "" What redeems it is the presence of Fraser...he successfully demonstrates how to be lusty and affable at the same time."" I love him in this. He is sexy, funny, and tremendously good at comedy. He has excellent comic timing. Rachel Weisz is also excellent in it. I think she played her bumbling, clumsy, but sexy librarian wonderfully. Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed-and definitely not bored!",1194566400,,1864,4.550595238095238

I got my HD DVD player last year and have been thoroughly stoked about it, given the right movie.  ""The Mummy"" is definitely one of those right movies.  From the opening credits to the first views of the Egyptian city, the clarity of the high-def presentation rivals that of your local theater.  Once a wall-sized monitor becomes available, film buffs are truly going to be able to have the theater experience right in their own homes.

The action sequences are great.  The colors are fantastic.  And the special effects are tremendous.  The dust cloud confrontation at the end just blew me away all over again.

I owned the movie on DVD and had watched it on television a few times (it's one of those on a list of guilty pleasures) but I hadn't seen anything like this presentation outside of the theater.

But there were a bunch of little things and scenes that went unnoticed before that are front and center in this edition because of the improved sound and picture.

One thing I never noticed before is right after Imhotep's casket fell through the tomb ceiling there is a line through the center of the picture, it disappeared in less than a minute. I doubt this is fault to do with the HD transfer so it was probably on the original print.

One weird thing was the menu. All of the other HD DVDs have graphics from the movie, this one had generic music and the universal logo.

Its blend of humour, adventure, action and nostalgia really did make it the INDIANA JONES IV movie that never was (but still may yet be - personally, I hope not. Best leave it at 3 good movies).

This disk is a good place to start for you if you are a bit new (as we are) to HD. It was, for years, a standard def test disk. The picture looks beautiful and sharp. The blue skies look crystal clear, the flames look hot, the gold looks warm and the reds don't bleed at all. Great DTS core sound too (its all we as yet - but we're working on it!) and a story that is a great old yarn that is creepy rather than scary.

There are some faults but they do lie fully on the limitation of film making technology at that period in time. On this disk, I do feel that the format does rather show up those limitations, it does make some blue/geen screen work seem even more obvious that it perhaps might be - a fault shared with THE MUMMY RETURNS, which we also have. It is hard to believe that what is regarded as cutting-edge can move so quickly.

I wasn't expecting much from this, I was actually expecting it to be more of a horror story, but its basically an action-adventure.  Some might not like that, but I do.  It brought back memories of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, of course thats what it meant to do.  I loved the dialoge.  It was funny and a bit cheesy, but again thats how this was supposed to be.

Even the subplots were gems--although you see Captain Havlock (Bernard Fox) for three scenes, he is a lively supporting character with his own soul and story.

Fraser was able to pull off a credible Indiana Jones-type character, while still maintaining his own adolescent playfulness.  I am glad that the directors and the producers let Brendan be Brendan, and thus differentiating this film form the other 1930's era films:  The Phantom, the Shadow, and Sky Captain.

This film is a delightful mixture of seriousness and comedy, horror and humor, capped off by tongue in cheek playfulness--reminiscent of the Ghostbusters or Kolchack.

There are only two drawbacks to this film. The first is that they went a little too wild with some of the CGI, specifically the slack-jaw expression of the mummies.  It looks funny the first time, but is too hokey.  They keep their shape, but do show some yellowing with age.

The other issue is why they called this The Mummy.  The Boris Karloff classic is it's own thing, and bears a superficial resemblance to this film.  As a fan of black and white films, it certainly would have cleared up things if I could talk about the Golden Age of Horror film without confusing the uninitiated.

Will he be stopped before enslaving humanity? I prefer T.P. to CGI, but CGI's appeal is understandable, especially on such a large scale as this. There is also too much humor in this film. Sparse amounts, sprinkled intermittently, might suit the adventurous mindset of the movie, but it was carried too far here. Apparently the intent was to distance this from the 1932 horror film as far as possible. The likeable Brendan Fraser fits the action hero role well, and I have given this three star movie an extra  star since it also features the beautiful Rachel Weisz.

3189259,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a throwback to two different schools of filmmaking: the globe-trotting republic serial adventure flicks (where Indiana Jones took inspiration from) and also the monster horror genre for which Universal Studios is famous for. The plot-line is pretty well-known; explorers and treasure hunters disturb a mummy's tomb, and he comes back to seek revenge. Only now instead of a man wrapped in bandages, we get sleek, sexy, bald Arnold Vosloo in robes and enhanced by computer graphics. And instead of the plastic, gung-ho hero we get the very likeable Brendan Fraser.

The Mummy is a pretty fun film from a relatively undistinguished director. If you dig the romanticized, Indiana Jones-style adventuring with laid back heroes and fiesty female leads (Rachel Weisz), this is a great movie to check out. The cast is having lots of fun, the script packs in lots of good comedy bits and action setpieces, and the CG effects are handled well. They went a little overboard with the sequel and packed in too much of everything there, but this first installment is a nicely contained film.

There are two editions, the regular collector's package and another 2-disc ultimate package. The ultimate set doesn't add that much except for commentaries and a look at the sequel (now useless), and also loses the isolated score bonus feature. This single disc can also be found in the Mummy 3-pack that collects all the movies together.

In addition to that, the plot besmirches one of the most revered figures in history - Imhotep, recorded history's first multi-disciplinary genius.

All that having been said, the subject matter is interesting enough that one can actually have some fun watching it. Rachel Weisz's spritely performance has a lot to do with that, though. Without her, this movie would be DOA.",1149552000,,584,5.020618556701031
3189261,4,B00004D2X8,"In the late 90's, Universal Studios decided it was time to dust off their famous monsters of old, and give them a face-lift in order to give thrills and chills to the new generation of moviegoers that never experienced them during their peak.  To accomplish this task, Universal tapped a relatively unknown director named Stephen Sommers to rejuvenate their famous monster the mummy.  So, with basically a rookie director, a lofty budget, and a decently big name star in Brendan Fraser, Universal put a lot of faith and clout behind their remake of ""The Mummy"".  But one problem still remains with this remake, can it possibly impress the older generation that grew up on the original, and can it muster enough thrills for the newer, more jaded generation?

""The Mummy"" is the story of a 3,000 year old force of terror being unleashed upon Egypt.  The mummy (Arnold Vosloo) is a former Egyptian priest named Imhotep, who betrayed the pharoah when he struck up an affair with the pharoah's wife, and as punishment both Imhotep and his love were placed in a cursed tomb where they would forever remain.  That is until a team of explorers lead by Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) accidentally release the monster upon Egypt.  As if the monster wasn't enough to deal with, Egypt is bombarded by plagues of Biblical proportion that seem to follow the mummy wherever he goes.  Can Rick and Evie save Egypt from the mummy's wrath, or will they become part of his unwitting legion of zombies?  Time will tell.

Though expectations for ""The Mummy"" were decent, there was still plenty of skepticism surrounding the possible success of the remake.  Earlier I posed the question that was present in many people's minds in regards to this film, could this remake even hope to equal the original film and impress both old and new generations of moviegoers?  The answer, a resounding yes for both.  Based on huge box office numbers and critical praise, it was clear that Universal's gamble to resurrect their monsters of old was not a mistake.  With the success of the film, actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz were propelled to super-stardom, and it wasn't long before the offers started rolling in.  The two lead actors weren't the only ones benefiting from the huge success of ""The Mummy"", director Stephen Sommers showed off his knack for special effects extravaganzas, and found himself in charge of a budding new franchise for Universal Studios, not a bad way to boost a career.  Alongside the live actors in the film, the special effects team at George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, were given the daunting task of creating a realistic-looking CGI mummy.  No small task by any means, but the creative team pulled it off stunningly, along with the CGI creation of the mummy, ILM handled all of the special effects work for the film, all with outstanding results by the way.  For a remake, an all to common theme in Hollywood these days, Universal sure chose wisely and managed to avoid the most common pitfall of remakes, the fact that most can't even come close to matching the original in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly ""The Mummy"" is the exception to what has long been the rule.

If you're looking for a good blockbuster movie with plenty of humor, thrills, and even a few chills, then do yourself a favor and watch this enjoyable film that rejuvenated the Hollywood monster movie genre and started a franchise in the process.

3189263,5,B00004D2X8,"If you think ""The Mummy"" is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again. ""The Mummy"" of 1999 is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) flick as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.

Everything magically works in ""The Mummy"" granting us a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene -- it's a hoot). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah grants some highly comedic moments as Rachael's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasle.

""The Mummy"" is not great ponderous art as in, say, ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level it's film-making of the highest order!",1140220800,,1041,4.683060109289618

Boris Karloff's ""The Mummy"" was remade in 2001 into The Mummy, starring Brendan Frasier. This is the sequel and is so much better than the original. The basic plot: some evil Arab dudes have resurrected Imhotep, chief royal advisor to long-gone Egyptian pharaoh Seti I, in order to power him up enough to take out a bad-ass known as the Scorpion King (played magnificently by The Rock)- and of course, Evie and her husband (Frasier) must kill either the Scorpion King or Imhotep to prevent the other from taking over the world. The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material. (Unfortunately, only the VHS version has the music video for ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough"" by Live [a song from the soundtrack and a perfect pick, in my opinion]).

This is more akin to Pirates of the Caribbean than it is to any Indian Jones movie.  Where Indiana Jones is 90% archaeology and history and 10% Sci-Fi / Occult this is probably the exact reverse.  The dialogue, though not great, is decent and funny at times. The protagonists are a motley bunch that stumble into success and find trouble easily.  All in all it is a good film to watch.

Even the mummy's stooge has a lot of personality and, aided by a nice performance, is never as flat as he could've easily been.  And the story is interesting without getting too complicated and ruining the pacing with endless scenes of exposition.

Since this film, most people know him as the guy who is still trying desperately hard to make a good film. Now Brendan Fraser is a good actor (in small doses) thats why he was enjoyable in Encino Man (crummy movie, but not much talking for him). At times Brendan was amusing but a majority of the time his acting seemed like he was trying really hard to fit into his role and it wasn't letting him in.

Rachel Weisz is a beautiful woman with a great acting skill. I'll leave it at that no complaints.

Special Effects were at the time revolutionary. They did things previously unattempted. Of course Stephen didn't do these things, the eggheads at ILM did.

While the second film (""The Mummy Returns"") is a limp retread, the original movie will go down in history as a modern classic. Some have pointed to the parallels between Fraser's character and Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. I will go out on a limb here and say Fraser's Rick O'Connell is even more interesting than Indy.

The actors in ""The Mummy"" seem to be having a fantastic time filming the movie (including Fraser), and this exuberance tends to carry the audience over several rough spots in the plot. You don't notice the movie's few missteps, because you are captivated in the action and wondering what is going to happen next.

When they accidentally awaken the ancient evil, they find themselves in a race against time to save their own skin and the world in general.  Is there a way to stop someone you can't kill?

This movie starts out rather slow.  The first hour is set up getting the characters to the city.  Once the Mummy awakens, however, it becomes a fast paced thrill ride you can't stop watching.  The actors do a great job of keeping things believable, even if the plot has a few holes in it.

The DVD truly has some great stuff on it.  Not only do you get great picture and sound with wide screen and full surround, but you get some fun features, too.  The director's audio commentary is fascinating, discussing the struggles that it took to get the movie to the screen.  Along those lines, the documentary is fantastic as well.

The fact that the film was set in the 1920's, the decade when King Tut's glorious tomb was discovered, rather than modern times boosts The Mummy's authenticity and effectiveness.

The lovebirds murder the Pharaoh, but are caught.  Ahnk Sunamun plunges a sword into her belly, and Imhotep is sentenced to the worst punishment of all.

Stephen Sommers has done some wild b-movies in his time (Deep Rising) and was a great choice to write and direct this remake of the old 1930s Universal horror show. Though I must stress that very little of this film is original.

Basically it's an Indiana Jones rip-off with bits of Evil Dead and Hellraiser thrown in. Cliches are abundant and stereotyped, stock characters make up much of the supporting cast. Not only do we get a fair English maiden and a bumbling Brit designed to make the yank look cool but there are also gung-ho cowboys, stuffy professors, a cowardly weasel traitor (who really gets what he deserves) and a slimy slob prison warden. Argh! There's no real point in complaining about this as they're just supposed to be easy identifiable characters for younger audiences to appreciate.

There isn't really much scary about The Mummy, which is what the original was all about. Which brings me to the main problem of the film. Im-ho-tep (played by the wicked-cool Nicolas Cage doppelganger Arnold Vosloo) is not really a bad guy. Everything he does is for love. Hardly the worst villain in history. In fact the greedy folks excavating his tomb, jeopardizing the lives of everyone else for the sake of money are far worse, morally.

The action is exciting and some of the plot elements, however copycatted, are imaginative and clever. The 2 hour+ running time seems to fly by. It may be unoriginal but there's still more heart in The Mummy than in rubbish like Underworld.

And in my opinion, the remakes should be done this way, writing new stories, adding more things, but respecting the original idea. When Hollywood tries to make a remake step by step, it usually is a fatal mistake, just take a look to ""Psycho (1998)"", it's a lame version of Hitchcock's original version.

""The Mummy"" is one of the quintessential summer movies of recent years, it's fast paced, it has amazing special effects, it has humor, it has colorful characters, and it has a beautiful heroine Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz), a brave girl that combines charm, exotic beauty and courage. The hero John Hannah (played by Brendan Fraser) is a combination of Indiana Jones and George Of The Jungle.

Fraser doesn't have the typical physical aspect of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Eastwood or Ford, but he does a good job in ""The Mummy"", and it's a welcome change to the typical movie hero. The movie has a lot of interesting visual effects, specially when Imhotep uses the sand to create a giant version of his face.

3189294,4,B00004D2X8,"1999's The Mummy is the equivalent of a B movie produced on an epic scale.  It's only real aim is to entertain, and it certainly does that.  The campy nature of the dialogue works because the filmmakers have no shame: what, you say we've already used up our quota of clich&eacute;s and really cheesy jokes?  Well, find more of them.  And get me some stereotypical Egyptians - we're not making this movie without some stereotypical Egyptian comic relief.  If you're going to go, go for broke, I always say.  The special effects also make things interesting.  Some of them are quite good, but every so often you will see something that just looks rather silly - but that's okay.  Hey, they already dropped a ton of money on special effects; you can't expect everything to be perfect.  Those of us fascinated by ancient Egypt pretty much will ourselves to be drawn into the story: after all, this thing starts out as a mission to find the legendary city of Hamunaptra, aka the City of the Dead, complete with nifty little codices, hieroglyphics, and ancient books.  Then of course you have the mummy; this guy is not content to just sneak around and say Boo in an effort to frighten everyone he meets; no, good old Imhotep has the plagues of Egypt as his calling card, and he possesses supernatural powers that make him all but invulnerable.
I know this story raises questions in the mind of the viewer.  Take, for example, the whole curse thing inflicted upon Imhotep.  I have to admit he had it coming; messing around with the Pharaoh's mistress, even when she is as attractive as Anck Su Namun, is a bad idea; murdering the pharaoh himself probably crosses the line into the land of major boo-boo.  What do you do to a high priest who has committed such sins?  Chop off his tongue - okay, I'm with you on that one; wrap him in mummy bandages and throw him in a sarcophagus - right, that will work; throw a bucket full of scarabs on him that will consume his flesh, then bury him alive - that does sound like a good plan.  But there's a catch; if he ever happens to be reanimated, he'll have super-powers.  That is when you have to start questioning ancient Egyptian judgment.  I would have just chopped the guy into pieces and made sure he could not have made it to an afterlife.
Well, adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and the sister-brother team of Evelyn the librarian of ancient Egyptian history and Jonathon the alcoholic find and open Imhotep's sarcophagus.  Evelyn then proceeds to read aloud from the Book of the Dead she just ""borrowed"" from a trio of American treasure hunters and brings Imhotep back to life.  Much chasing, fighting, killing, and general mayhem ensue.  All poor Imhotep wants to do is to reanimate the corpse of his beloved Anck Su Namun; most men can't even remember their wife's birthday, but this guy, after 3000 years, still thinks only of his special lady.  Doesn't that just make you feel warm all over?
Don't expect to learn anything about Egypt in this film; The Mummy plays fast and loose with internal logic, so it certainly isn't out to recreate ancient Egypt in a realistic fashion.  Just sit back, laugh when you're supposed to, and let The Mummy entertain you.  Personally, I'm fascinated with actress Rachel Weisz.  She just has a rare, hypnotic radiance to her that grows and grows as the movie progresses.",1083715200,,3359,4.635135135135135

The Mummy by Universal Pictures, is probably the best remake of an original horror film I have seen. It's not just a remake, but it's a completely new story that is scary, entertaining, fun and suspenseful. Now this great movie has been released on a DVD and it comes with a couple of nice features and presents this film in great form.
The movie stars Brendan Frasier as a French soldier fighting in the Middle East who is captured and about to be executed by enemy forces.
Rachel Weis plays Evelyn Carnahan, an archelogist who accidently saves Frasier from
execution. Evelyn loves studying and learning about Mummy Tombs, pharoas and Egyptian people. Eventually Evelyn learns of a special book called the Book of The Dead, which is all about mummies, resurrection andthe afterlife.
Evelyn and a group of other explorers,start digging into the tomb and treasures
of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), an evil and vicious king who is killed with his
mistress in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead.
Basically this guy and his mistress committed violent crimes and eventually got the
same punishment they inflicted on their victims. Evelyn and the other nieve explorers, eventually resurrect the dead king which leads to a chain reaction of violence, death, and imminent death to anyone who comes
into his path.
The King/Mummy isn't at full strength, and so uses his magical and deadly powers, starts absorbing his victims, until he gets full power. Once he gets full power, the Mummy not only plans to resurrect his evil mistress but plans to conquer everthing in it's path.
Richard Occonel (Frasier) and the others must not only find a way to stay alive but find a way to kill the mummy before his power becomes to great
and powerful to be stop.
----------------
Visual Effects
--------------
Before the movie, horror films had used a couple of visual effects mixed in with
horror. ''A NightMare On Elm Street'' for example but ''The Mummy'' raises the bar for visual effects in a horror film to an all time high.
When you are not getting scared to death by the suspense and horror of the film,
you are dazzled by the amazing special effects which an all new area to the film.
For instance, the visual effects that show The Mummy metamorphorsing to it's
true form is not only scary, but fantastic!!!
Also the many scenes in the film, like the quicksand scene, and the many scenes
where the dead warriors of the mummy come to life are absolute chilling, because
they brought to life by the special effects.

The Mummy's Success
------------------
The Mummy released in 1999, was a great box office smash which had horror fans going to the movie in great numbers. The film's success lay in combing a good story, along with great effects, and graphic , suspenseful scenes that leave on the edge of you're seat.
Eventually, the creators of the Mummy would smell it's success and create a sequel
called ''The Mummy Returns''.
The Mummy Returns is a great sequel in which the Mummy is again being revived, along with a strong warrior known as ''The Scorpion King'' All these sequels, couldn't have done been done without this one. The Mummy by Steven Soderbergh is a great horror film full of great suspense and visual effects. The DVD is very well done and is highly recommended.

3189299,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy was a surprise box-office smash in 1999, it grossed over $400 million worldwide.  Writer/director Stephen Sommers soon became noticied, his previous film Deep Rising wasn't much of a hit, he also followed up with a sequel, The Mummy Returns in the summer of 2001.
  The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, John Hannah, Oded Fehr and the very funny Kevin J. O'Conner.  Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a young soldier who is soon arrested and held in a prison, Weisz plays Evelyn, a librarian who is in search of an adventure, Hannah plays her funny brother, Johnathan.  Weisz agrees to pay the prison handler a substantial payment in order to release Fraser, and Fraser is agreeing to lead Weisz into Humanptra, the city of the Dead.  The film's prologue starts off with a little lesson about Imhoptep, the Pharoah's high priest, and it explains why he was killed.  Soon the film's suspense builds up when Weisz finds the Book of the Dead, and unfortunately reads from it and wakes up Imhotep.  The adventure, suspense and intensity begins and Fraser along with his friends must stop Imhotep from becoming invincible.
  The film does stay reasonably close to the story of the original 1932 Boris Karloff classic, The Mummy.  Though critics didn't really relish it, it did succeed at the box-office and was a huge hit of 1999.  The real highlights of the movie would have to be the action sequences, that's what the film really is about: ACTION and lots of it.  The visual and special effects were also superb, specifically the sequence with sandface and plane.  This film was also suprisingly humorous, Kevin J. O'Conner plays Benny, Rick's friend along with John Hannah, Weisz's brother in the film.  I actually though Fraser was able to pull of the lead role, I never really pictured him as a hero especially of an action flick, one who saves the day so to speak
but he does it well, he's charming, cunning and handsome.  Weisz who was a bit of an unknown then, quickly gained her fame and soon appeared in a lot of other movies.  Also Oded Fehr who plays a Medjai warrior comes in of some assistance, he's perfect for his role for he's handsome, strong and cunning.  And as for writer/director Stephen Sommers, he quickly was on the rode to stardom, he has a new film in progress called Van Helsing which looks pretty neat, comes out May 7th, 2004, and interestingly enough The Mummy came out on May 7th, 1999 so just about the same time.
  The Mummy is rated PG-13 for Pervasive Adventure Violence and Some Partial Nudity.  The violence is just about non-stop, despite the film's gory premise, the movie isn't really over-the-top or horribly gruesoming.  The violence includes lots of bloodless gunplay, fistfights, swordplay and other mayhem.  There is partial nudity, which is fairly revealing.  Not really any profanity, though this film might not be too good for young children because they're are a few frightening images, such as the scareb beetles, the mummies which are monster-like, etc.
All in all this film is fairly silly, but still is works well on its own.  It's cool, action-packed and funny, a great film and not a bad pick to own on Video or DVD, preferrably the special edition.",1077321600,,3235,4.7855855855855856

Imhotep, the priest, is in love with the Pharoh's mistress.  When this is revealed to the angry Pharoh, the mistress commits suicide, and Imhotep is tortured, then buried alive.  A curse is put over him that he might rise again, bringing with him the plauges of Egypt, his sole purpose to resurrect his love.  Centuries later, an explorer and a librarian team up to find the city in which he was buried, but find much more than that.  The film is amazing!  For children, I would say a maybe.  The violence is fairly intense, and I'm not a big fan of some of the magic, but all-in-all I enjoyed this flick.  This will be a classic for ages to come!!!",1068076800,,807,4.391891891891892
3189304,5,B00004D2X8,"There is a wonderful, unpretentious vibe to The Mummy that makes it a true crowd pleaser. Unlike most Indiana Jones-style imitators, it isn't really trying to rip off that movie but instead take a page out of its book and pay homage to the old '30s serials of which the Indy films also drew their inspiration from. And it does it successfully.
Brendan Fraser finally catapulted to proper leading man status with this film and he is great. In the best Harrison Ford tradition, Fraser has a roguish charm, but when it comes down to it, is a true hero. The chemistry between him and Rachel Weisz is excellent and feels genuine. She is no mere damsel in distress and holds her own with the big boys and isn't too hard on the eyes either. The supporting cast is also top notch -- although, Kevin O'Connor does get on my nerves a bit, but that was kinda the point of his character, I suppose.
Stephen Sommers does a solid job directing this movie. After Deep Rising, who woulda thought? He creates the perfect mood and atmosphere of a period film but with a contemporary twist, of sorts, and also includes exciting action set pieces that action/adventure fans expect. There is just the right blend of humour, thrills and action.
Fans of the film should get this particular DVD set because it includes a wealth of extra material... the highlights being the 3 audio commentaries: one by Sommers and his editor that is informative, one by Fraser, which has the occasional lulls, but is not bad, and finally, the best of the bunch, the cast commentary with Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo which is lots of fun to listen to -- definitive the most enjoyable of the three.
There is also an awesome, speaker-shaking DTS track on the first disc and a near flawless transfer. There are tons of goodies on the second DVD -- mostly background info Egyptian mythology and technical featurettes on how they did effects, etc. which is fine if you're into that kinda thing.
Bottom line: this is as good as action/adventure films get without the Indy Jones label on it. Sommers and co. went on to make The Mummy Returns, which I found anti-climatic and too overloaded with action sequences and missing the magic that the first one had (also they added an annoying kid!). Except no substitutes and get this movie!",1065052800,,2304,4.635696821515892
3189305,5,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is maximum adventure, a rollercoaster ride of non-stop action, cliffhanger thrills, and crowdpleasing humor. Writer/director Stephen Sommers' homage of Saturday Matinee serials and past horror films is every bit as fun as the Indiana Jones movies, and even surpasses them when it comes to frenetic pacing. Not since The Last Crusade have I seen an adventure movie so enjoyable and immensely likeable.
To keep the film from ever getting boring, Sommers wisely delivers a wide variety of action sequences. There are massive gun battles (the opening is spectacular), chases (on foot, car, and even airplane), and swordfights. So much of it is so thrilling, it's hard to decide which action scene is the best (perhaps the opening gun battle or the sandstorm or the climactic sword battle against the mummies). The special effects are outstanding and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy Imhotep makes for a genuinely imposing villain.
Most importantly, though, the characters are likeable and a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser makes for a dashing action hero, Rachel Weisz is an appealing heroine, and John Hanna is hilarious as Weisz's inept brother. With characters worth caring for, the movie even builds up palpable suspense and excitement, all the way to the very end. Too bad the sequel wasn't nearly as fun.",1064620800,,1305,5.102803738317757

3189308,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy was a film I wasn't quite sure about when I saw it on commercials.  But when it came out on video, I decided to rent it and check it out.  I admit, I actually liked it, more so than I thought.  It is by no means a flawless film, but it's quite entertaining and it's a movie, and a movie is supposed to be entertaining.
Brendan Fraser is sort of a carbon copy of Indiana Jones in a lot of ways, but he is original enough that he forms his own character quite well.  Even though this is really the only film I've seen him and brushing by his other film titles, it may be the last as well.  Fraser brings a heroic, but funny persona to the movie, which makes it very enjoyable.  His one liners and how he says them are very funny and you can't help but cheer him on when he wrestles with dead guys.
The only problem I have with Fraser's character, and I wouldn't really call it a problem I guess, but a critique, is that his character is a little too invincible.  Again, this adds to the entertainment, but some parts I think are too unrealistic, almost cartoon like.  Example: slashes off the head of a mummy with his sword and uses that head on the end of the sword to bash another mummy.  Funny, but cartoon like, least it was to me.
As for the story line, it was pretty good, bringing Mummies back to the silver screen.  People have an appetite or craving for Egyptian culture.  Why Hollywood doesn't make more films surrounding Mummies or Egypt is a quandry to me.  This film educates you a little bit about Egyptian methods of mummification, but the history of it is kinda awful.  The storyline does have plenty of suspense in it, which is what makes this film work.  I thought the regeneration of the mummy was quite good and the different plagues that followed the curse.  You'll see.  If you've seen past mummy movies then you'll probably follow along nicely.
Something I did not like was the mummy trying to make out with Rachel Weisz's character.  I thought that was quite gross and stupid.  A dead thing wanting to kiss a mortal?  Not real.  Rachel Weisz's character is quite cute I might add, but that's not relevant.
Um, a problem I had with this movie was the animation.  I say animation instead of special effects, because that's how it comes across.  The Mummy starts off as a skeleton and you can tell that it's a computer pixel.  It's not even close to being real.  And some of the background shots are also too animated.  I mean, the special effects weren't all that great in certain parts, it made this film too unreal and too computerized.
Overall, I give this film four stars.  I give it four stars because it is a good, entertaining film that you can watch more than once.  This film isn't for the serious, I might add, it is for the easy movie goer who is looking for a fun time.  But the animation kinda keeps this from being a five star movie because it keeps it from being scarey as well as real.  Which if this film had, it would be a classic.

In the heart of the Sahara, two determined expeditions search for the mysterious City of Hamunaptra to uncover its legendary secrets and vast treasures. The group accidentally unearths the wrath of a 3000-year-old mummy whose power can cover the world in darkness. Unlike the 1932 horror classic, ""The Mummy"" is a solid thrill-a-minute adventure that combines daring heroics, witty humor and amazing special effects. This stylish remake contains a well structured story and some amusing characters. Brendan Fraser is quite outstanding as a lively adventure hero. The cast also includes Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo. Director Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) keeps the excitement soaring with nonstop action sequences and eye-popping visual effects.

3189310,5,B00004D2X8,"I'm not exactly sure one can put enough emphasis on how great and entertaining a movie ""The Mummy"" is.  Reflecting upon the many great action/adventure movies of the nineties brings me to the conclusion that this silver screen phenomenon must be listed among the top five to ten films of the nineties.  Of course this is evidenced by its overwhelming box office receipts and DVD sales.  The odd thing for me was that due to a heavy work schedule and limited time, I never even saw a trailer for this great movie and thus didn't afford myself the opportunity to see it in the theaters!  This oversight was of course corrected with its sequel, ""The Mummy Returns.""
The stars - Given Brendan Frasier's past films I never would've ever expected him to make such an outstanding action/adventure star as he is with his performance in this film.  It almost seems as if the role of swashbuckling adventurer Rick O'Connell was created for him and him alone.  Then there's the ever beautiful and gorgeous Rachel Weisz starring as ""Evy"" or Evelyn whose performance in this film is dead on perfect as the librarian/adventurer.  Arnold Vosloo performs perfectly in the role of the Mummy.
One might think that a film of this nature might fall short on plot while being heavy on the action; this is simply not the case with ""The Mummy.""  The film moves along fluidly with a great amount of attention centered on the plot and supported perfectly by the comedic moments and the seamless CGI provided by ILM, the masters of the CGI domain.
I don't normally comment on the director but in this case I feel almost compelled to state that director and author of the screenplay, Stephen Sommers ""must"" be commended for bringing this outstanding story to fruition for it is simply a brilliant piece of work.  In ""The Mummy"" he has most certainly created the latest and greatest big budget, heavy action film series that can easily be compared to the Indiana Jones films, using those as a benchmark.
The premise:
The film opens with a superb opening sequence some three thousand years ago as we're taken to ancient Egypt in the year 1290 B.C. and shown the circumstances of how the High Priest Imhotep ended up being the Mummy through his and Anck Su Namun's treachery against Pharaoh Seti.  After his treachery, he attempts to resurrect Anck Su Namun in Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the Pharaoh's guards catch him and he is mummified.
Scrolling forward to the year 1926 and we meet our erstwhile heroes who through their chance meeting are on an adventure to find Hamunaptra.  While the majority of the group is searching for hidden treasure, Evy is looking for more...  Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, she finds more and what follows is as stated above, one of the best action/adventure movies of the nineties and probably the best of this type since the last Indiana Jones film.
I highly recommend this film for all its merits; it is a great film that is fun and extraordinarily enjoyable.  {ssintrepid}

Second - throughout the desert cross, which took few days, Evie somehow managed to remain snow white, not even a single sign that she spent days in 120-degree sun.

The commercials for the movie were intriguing, but I was still apprehensive when I went to the theater.  I was not prepared for the combination of humor and horror in this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised at how well this movie exceeded the horror classics.  The DVD goes one better by adding extras and the opportunity to see this movie again and again.
We begin the movie with the story of Imhotep, played very well and evilly by Arnold Vosloo.  Imhotep has the hots for Pharaoh's mistress, played by Patricia Velazquez.  Unfortunately for all but the movie goers, the affair is discovered, Pharaoh is murdered, and Imhotep gets to suffer the hong dai (pardon my spelling), which means having flesh-eating beetles thrown into your sarcophagus just before it is sealed.
Scroll forward a couple thousand years to introduce Brendan Frasier as our hero, a less-serious and devil-may-care version of Indiana Jones, only much less knowledgeable and handier with guns and one-liners.  We get to meet Brendan fighting off desert nomads in 1920-something near Hamunaptra.  Of course, that just happens to be where Imhotep was buried.  However, this vignette is merely a connection between Imhotep's interment and the adventure that ultimately frees him.
We move forward into the future again, this time to meet Rachel Weisz playing librarian Evelyn Carnahan in Cairo.  Evelyn's brother has discovered a map and a key that appear to lead to Hamunaptra, and the vast treasures that are supposed to be there.  Unfortunately the map is ""accidentally"" destroyed, so Evelyn goes to find Brendan, who supposedly knows the location of Hamunaptra without a map.
As it turns out, a whole host of people make their way to Hamunaptra.  The Book of the Dead is discovered and is used to bring Imhotep back to life, and then the real fun begins.  From this point forward the mummy becomes stronger and stronger, terminating in a battle between mummified warriors, priests, Imhotep, Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weisz, her brother, and assorted others who have become involved in the story along the way.
While humor enlivens this movie in most of the scenes with Brendan Frasier, and many of the scenes with Rachel Weisz, this movie remains a horror movie with comic moments.  The deaths are played seriously, and some are chilling, if not horrible.  There is nothing funny about any of the death scenes.  Some scenes may even make you squeak, if only a little.
The movie was plotted quite well, with the action holding your attention from beginning to end.  The slow moments are few and set up the next action sequence so well that you never drift.  Furthermore, while there are a few plot inconsistencies, they are so minor that you may not notice them until you have seen the movie several times.  In case you haven't spotted one yet, here's an example.  Imhotep gets a huge case of flesh-eating beetles dumped into his sarcophagus, yet he has time to carve a message into the lid.  Furthermore, it was stated by Rachel Weisz that his death would have been long and slow.  Yet, everyone else that ran into the beetles died within either seconds, or at most, minutes.
Forgiving the minor inconsistencies, this movie has set the standard for mummy movies.  No worries about how the slow-moving mummy catches up to fast-moving prey.  This mummy is all action and has no problem getting what he wants.  For giving me a good mix of action, humor, special effects, and a few good scary moments, this movie gets 5 stars.",1044230400,,3622,4.890343698854337
3189318,5,B00004D2X8,"I don't know how many times I have seen this movie on cable but enough that I had to own a copy of it in my movie collection. I absolutely adore the sequel to ""The Mummy"" and its predecessor as well (haven't seen the prequel ""The Scorpion King""). ""The Mummy"" is reminds me a lot like the Indiana Jones series with the adventures and hijinks the main characters gets into. The premise of ""The Mummy"" isn't too far from the old horror movie but minus the bandages and overwrought lurching and instead is replaced with computer graphics and comedy alongside the action. Jonathan Carnahan (played by John Hannah) wasn't nearly as annoying in this film while he really got on my nerves in ""The Mummy Returns"". Some of my favorite scenes in the movies involved the spineless little weasel Beni played by the wonderful Kevin J. O'Connor. He brought the humor element to the movie with his treacherous and greedy ways. And of course watching Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo was as usual a pleasure to watch. I especially loved watching Imhotep suck the life essence out of the Americans. One of the funniest was when Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) and Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) entered the bedroom where Imhotep was kissing Evie. Just as Imhotep was about to attack Rick, Rick holds up the cat. The battle scenes were excellent and probably my favorite moment in the entire movie. I loved seeing all those mummies, Imhotep's priests and bodyguards (?). The visual effects in this movie were dazzling, especially when Imhotep conjured up his image in the sands when he brought down the plane that Rick and his companions were flying in. ""The Mummy"" may not be Masterpiece Theatre but I don't care. I consider this film a rocking good time.",1044057600,,1734,4.745033112582782
3189319,5,B00004D2X8,"... As for the movie itself, it had so much to get excited about.  There was comedy, romance, suspense and extreme respect for the creature depicted.  Imhotep stole the show, and he was, I think, just the way a monster should be.  Freaky, spooky, icky and almost godlike to a point.
And it was the supernatural action that really pushed this film over the edge.  Most Scifi and horror gets my appreciation based solely on the scale of power that the hero/villain possesses, and this one went above and beyond.  I mean, we have a guy who's basically a sand-God, but also has superhuman strength, is immortal, commands deadly man-eating insects and can summon the 10 plagues of Egypt!  That's world-threatening stuff right there... But anyways, spooky, yes, but that's part of it's charm.  Take the monster, creepyness and all, and cherish it.

3189326,4,B00004D2X8,"This movie sort of suprised many people. It was full of virtual unknown actors, and was Frasier's first real attempt at a leading ""action"" star. To my suprise, he did quite well blending small comedic antidotes into an otherwise action-packed film. The storyline was also somewhat creative with the mummy's origin and curse. I did however have a slight problem with the method used to finally end the mummy's rampage, but aside from that this is an overall good film.",1023494400,,467,4.85
3189327,4,B00004D2X8,"When one buys a DVD, it's not enough for the movie to be good. The edition should also have something extra, measured by the amount of features. Fortunately, this edition for ""The Mummy"" fills both requisites. It is a great movie, and it has lots of features to go with it.
Even though it's officially a remake of the classic Universal monsters box, this version of  ""The Mummy"" has nothing to do with its predecessor. For starters, it's not a horror movie, but an action-adventure film, more familiar to the Indiana Jones saga. That blend between action and comedy that made professor Jones so famous has been imitated in a lot of movies, but this one, so far, is the only one who makes it justice..
All of the cast members do a great job, and all of them handle the action/comedy duality to near perfection. Playing opposite Brendan Fraser is Arnold Vooslo as The Mummy, and even tough he never actually speaks anything besides his ancient Egyptian language, his presence alone is almost supernatural. So it should be, because he has to fill in Boris Karloff's shoes (some big shoes, indeed). The level of the special effects is superb, specially when it regards the gradual regeneration of the Mummy itself.
In fact, since the producers knew that the special effects area is one of the most interesting angles of the movie, they packed this edition with a lot of features regarding that area. The documentary about the work of Industrial Light & Magic couldn't have been better, and the commentary by the director and the SFX designer is also a great addition. The only flaw, of course, is that it lacks some subtitles. So, in conclusion, this DVD passes the test well enough. It has great features, and the movie itself is very good too, so, what are you waiting for?",1022803200,,1771,4.676282051282051
3189328,3,B00004D2X8,"Ok, folks, this movie was ok.  However, anyone who would give it five stars is a moron.  This was not a GREAT movie it was a GOOD movie.  I also can't see how anyone can compare this movie with Raiders of the Lost Ark.  That was a GREAT movie.  It was nominated for best picture.  It was original.  How much slapstick comedy did you see in Raiders?  How many cliches did you catch in Raiders?  There is a difference between slapstick/stupid comedy and true witty humor.  It's obvious that most movie goers can't make this distinction.
The main reason that I like this film is because of the way they designed the Mummy (Imhotep).  Excellent casting there.  He was menacing and he was powerful.  His character carries this movie.
Unfortunately, there is just way too much comedy in this flick.  It detracts from any suspense or awe.  It's hard to get caught up in a movie when the main characters are constantly saying and doing STUPID things.

3189331,4,B00004D2X8,"Stephen Sommer's remake of the Boris Karlof original is a fun, if sometimes silly take on the story of the Mummy. A huge box-office success in the summer that gave us The Matrix and The Phantom Menace in 1999, this action- adventure is big on action, great SFX and witty laughs. Taking ideas from other films (Indiana Jones), it nonetheless is a cracking adventure tale that starts off great and builds up with a huge string of sequences and set pieces.
Sommers, who gave us The Jungle Book (1995) and Deep Rising (1998) gets a bigger budget, some great ideas and impressive SFX creations. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weiz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah, The Mummy is great pocorn- munching entertainment, with some amusing, well-timed humour and great action set pieces. Watching a CGI Mummy seek vengeance on the group who wake him up is so much fun. However, the story tends to get silly, and the script is rather wooden. And the film, inevitably, spawned the inferior The Mummy Returns. Sequels notwithstanding, it's a B movie with an A grade budget and a top cast, and the DVD is packed with tons of extras on the making of the film. Good fun.",1019520000,,1153,4.684729064039409

It made me laugh when Brendan Frazier, (O'Connor), the man out to save Rachel Weeiz, (Evy), decided not to fight the guards he rushed. It is good to see that something with an old title has a fresh, new, and comical insight. I enjoyed the classical movie of the same name, but this one was great too.
Bennie's character was just as sandy as Imhotep's. His greed for wealth only surpassed his desire for self-preservation. I like Rachel's comment to him, ""Bad people always get their comeuppance in the end. They really do."" I don't know why, but I laughed at the cryptic prophecy. Her brother was somethng of a bumbling inept, but very comical.

3189337,4,B00004D2X8,"There is no escaping The Mummy. It did very well in theaters, and Universal Studios, which hadn't had a hit in ages. promptly decided to do a sequel, which it unleashed the next year. The affable Brendan Fraser seems destined to fit into Harrison Ford's shoes, at least his action/adventure shoes.
I have to write about this movie on two levels, because Egyptology is of the few subjects other than movies with which I am fairly familiar. I am touchy about the way my beloved old Egyptians are portrayed on screen. From this point of view, I found The Mummy to be a trashy work written by people with no knowledge or interest in history for an audience of similar ignorance. Yet, if I remove this personal bias, The Mummy becomes a whiz bang action-adventure comedy that is similar to, but not quite equal to, the three Indiana Jones flicks.
We are told at the beginning that, 3,000 years ago, a beautiful princess, who may be touched only by the Pharaoh, is having an affair with the priest Imhotep. [Both the princess and the priests have their skin covered by gold paint, and they look like they are about to go out to a hot Thebes disco.] Naturally, they are caught. The princess is slain, and Imhotep vows to bring her back to life. Before he can accomplish this, he is captured and faces a cruel death. A curse is put on him that is so powerful it has never been used before. [How can the Egyptians know how powerful it is if they never tried it?]
Fast forward to 1923. Rick O'Connell [Brendan Fraser] finds his regiment outnumbered by a never named enemy. The smart soldiers run away, the dumb ones dye. Soon, Rick is the last man standing. Just as he is about to be shot, some unnatural force causes the winds to howl and the sands to blow. The bad guys flee. Meanwhile, in Cairo, we find the lovely Evelyn [Rachael Weisz] and her larcenous brother, Jonathan [John Hannah]. Their late parents gave tons of money to some Cairo Museum, so now the kids play at archeology. Naturally their paths cross with Rick's, who leads them into the desert in search of a lost treasure city. Well, you can imagine whose tomb they chose to open in said city. Then, the real fun begins. I say fun, because this version of The Mummy concentrates a lot more on humor than on horror. Perhaps this is because the original has become such a camp classic.
Fraser is quite likable as Rick. While his range as an actor is large, this is the kind of work that will get him a ton of fans, not to mention a multimillion dollar beach house. Fraser should keep in mind that both fans and beach houses are at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of differing tides, and he would be wise to also pursue more serious fare. Hannah and Weisz try hard, but are overwhelmed by the special effects. Perhaps the best performances are those of Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep and Kevin J. O'Connor as the treacherous and hilarious Benji.
Some of the digital special effects are wonderful, while others, like the man-eating scarab beetles, are cheesy. On the whole, the technicians could have used some lessons from those who worked on The Matrix.
About that history. Seti I did not build the Great Sphinx, as implied in the opening. The plagues Imhotep uses are Hebrew. not Egyptian. They are the ones Moses resorted to. And so forth. The only thing that is remotely accurate historically is the film's portrayal of 1920s Egyptologists as more plunderers and thieves than archeologists.

I mean don't get me wrong. both movies were hott but the mummy returns was missing alot of things that the first one had. #1 it was missing all of the mummy's powers and the effects were better in the mummy returns but not the story line. I mean the scorpion king that which i thought was the tightest character in the movie even though he didn't have that many parts in the movie is really having it's own movie orgin coming to theaters on April 19th this spring. But the scorpion King is a whole nother story and it is like trying to put both movies ""The Scorpion King"" and ""The Mummy"" into one movie screwing up the story line.

3189351,5,B00004D2X8,"This is a terrific set of DVD's. For fun and information, they are much better than even the Star Wars DVD. For film enthusiasts, the commentaries are a delight. What is the most fun is that there are 3 and the ones with the actors give a LOT of insight. It's wonderful to hear Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr and Kevin J. O'Connor give their views and relate experiences. You learn a lot about the film in the technical sense from the director, but you learn a lot more about the actors and the human part from the other 2 interviews. The only problem with the commentaries is that Brendan Frasier's voice is a bit too low to hear over some of the movie. Also knowing all the goofs sometimes takes away from the film because you see them every time you view it.
The BEST way to get uninitiated people into viewing WideScreen (letterbox) instead of the horrific Pan and Scan/Full Frame is to do what they did here and include both. The nasty Full Frame will never compare to the WS version in ANY movie. With even a 27"" TV tube, the theater effect is really there.
I am absolutely delighted with this DVD and The Mummy Returns. As an ardent fan, I am very disappointed that there won't be a third installment. While the second movie is fun, it didn't capture the fantasy and comedy as the first one did. It focused too much on action and lost some continuity and some of the romance and fantasy. The Scorpion King didn't need to be featured so much because he took away from Arnold Vosloo's character and relegated him to the background.
I thought it would be absolutely riveting to have the O'Connells travel to Central America and have the mummy from an Ancient Mayan King come after them...think of the beautifiul sets, jade, gold and excitement...A real way to make the third a charm.

3189353,3,B00004D2X8,"This 1999 blockbuster harks back to the old 40's and 50's Saturday morning matinee serials. It also, and not too discretely, does the Indiana Jones thing too. The movie is totally cartoonish. Is that bad?. Of course not. The movie was meant to be a fun, entertaining ride, and it's just that. Brendan Fraser stars as our hero who is propositioned by Egyptologist Evelyn(played by the lovely Rachel Weisz), to guide her to the lost city of Hamunaptra. The City Of The Dead. It sounds charming. Once they start digging there, they find the mummified corpse of Imhotep. He was a man who was buried alive millions of years ago because he was sleeping with the pharaoh's daughter. Even back then men didn't know better. Anywho, he is revived by a spell Evelyn accidentally reads and all hell breaks loose. He plans on resurrecting his love, which includes a lot of gore and violence. He sucks the life out of the people who were there at the dig in order to be regenerated. Oh boy, there's always a catch!. The action scenes are fun and campy. There is a nice, quirky touch of humor throughout the film that is quite funny. The effects and make-up are all good. The cast is pretty solid, if not a tad mediocre. The sets are truly wonderful and are filmed wonderfully by director Stephen Sommers. It's a highly enjoyable and entertaining 'popcorn' flick that is only to be as such. The fun was sort of lost on the overstuffed sequel. Still, this is a entertaining movie.",1010361600,,1464,4.591603053435114
3189354,5,B00004D2X8,"I've heard a wide variety of mixed reviews about ""The Mummy"" so last weekend my wife and I watched it for ourselves. If you're a die hard Boris Karloff Mummy fan, you'll notice that several of the script lines are from the 1933 flick, although different people utter these. Boris was both Imhotep and Ardeth Bay while his old flame was Anchsunamun. Be prepared, they all show up in this new Mummy movie but as three different people (No Karis or Princess Ananka here). If you're looking for a Karloff/Chaney/Christopher Lee style leg dragging, bandage laden mummy movie, forget it. It's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Industrial Light and Magic, as usual, did a bang up job with the FX. To cut the long story short, it's a 21st century version of all of the old mummy movie plots with tons of action and amazing special effects. It's a new twist on an old story line, but hey, that's what Hollywood seems to have been doing here the past several years. We both rated it 5 stars because we both love action flicks and this one sure fits the bill.
If your're not into action or horror flicks(The Mummy is not really graphic horror), then don't even bother seeing this movie or its sequel (let alone rating it). However, if you are, then I recommend it highly.

3189358,2,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy borrows heavily from Indiana Jones, just look at the heros clothing. The story is about some ancient bad guy Imothep(Vosloo) that kills the Farao and meets his end in a most cruel way.
The story starts when Egyptologist Evelyn(Weisz) discovers a map to a lost city and hires the bold adventurer O'Conell(Fraser). Once at the lost city Evelyn unlocks the tomb of Imothep the evil Imothep.
The old mummy is (mad) and quite hungry for love, so he decides that he wants his old girlfriend(which by the way was the Faraos wife) returned to life. During his attempts to get his girlfriend back(he for some reason believe Evelyn is a reincarnation of her), he among other things release 10 plagues on Egypt and mannages to kill off alot of people. The movie also includes alot of flesheating bugs.
The movie have to be seen in a humoristic light, but even when viewed as such it falls short. Fraser is certainly no Indiana Jones no matter how hard he tries he simply lacks the right stuff, and no matter how many special effects are used the movie never reaches the level of movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1007942400,,1114,4.575

However, there a real big problem with the movie, and that's The Mummy himself. Frankly, he's a bore. He goes about screaming all the time, with his mouth getting wider and wider, thanks to special effects photography. And then, he seems to have one really favorite way of making himself disagreeable, gouging out eyes. How many times were they going to run that one? And the recurrent scarab beetles were too much already too. So there's an incessant sameness about The Mummy and his adventures that is annoying. I think the earlier Karloff version is a thousand times better than this one--see my review for a fuller treatment. Final analysis: okay, but more variety would have been better.",1005955200,,982,4.921686746987952

3189362,5,B00004D2X8,"Whatever you think of the movie (and I loved it!) this DVD is the best I have seen (and I have about 100). It is packed to the brim with extras, including the best type of commentary by director and designer, and mini features on the making of the movie, special effects, and even web-page equivalents (although viewable through your DVD player and not requiring a computer) on Egyptology and Egyptian artefacts. I would recommend any electronics shop hoping to sell some DVD players invests in a copy of The Mummy because it shows how good the format can be when used to its full potential. Turning to the film, this was a loving re-creation of the 1930s Universal horror movie, yet updated to 1990s standards. In Arnold Vosloo the film has an effective monster, and comparisons with Karloff are unfair. Rachel Weisz is the sort of beautiful actress that appeals to both men and women for different reasons, and funnily enough, George Of The Jungle star Brendan Fraser shows that that film was just an embarrassing hiccup and that he does have talent after all. And of course, the girls love him! The beauty of the desert long shots is matched by the attention to detail in the CGI effects, which shows how effects can enhance a film without making it seem (Terminator II?) like a lot of effects strung together in a loose plot. The fighting skeletons are reminiscent of the best Ray Harryhausen stop-motion work, and it would be good to see more of them in the sequel! There's a lovely scene at the beginning of the movie where a whole room full of bookshelves is 'domino-toppled'. This seems predictable but this sort of corniness is excusable in that it introduces the characters and gives us a contrast with the later action. A lovely film made by a dedicated director and a talented cast, and probably the best DVD made to date.",1005782400,,1834,4.6461538461538465

Brendan Fraser is a blast to watch as dual pistol packing, attitude slapping, down to earth ex-Legionnaire who finds himself teaming up with a couple of geeky librarian siblings, one of which happens to be the beautiful Rachael Weisz.  Fraser's character is hired by the two because he has seen something no one else has, the grave site of the lost city of Hamunaptra that holds the tomb of Imhotep, a powerful high priest in the days of the greatest and richest Pharaoh.  What follows is a semi complex adventure that keeps you hanging and keeps you entertained.  There are definitely some creepy moments and some aspects are intriguing, specifically the burials and rituals of the ancient Egyptians.  Some aspects are of course, stretched and unrealistic, but you can't expect Oscar material from some thing like this, who in their right mind would?

3189382,5,B00004D2X8,"I have been collecting DVDs since nearly the beginning and have gone through my share of buying films twice in this format because of ""Special Editions"" coming out later on.  But I can't help but feel a little cheated when a studio releases a film on DVD as a ""Collector's Edition"", then six or so months later, re-releases the same movie as an ""Ultimate Edition"" with more extras added.  In The Mummy's case, the added extras include 2 more audio commentaries, one with star Brendan Fraser, who goes on and on about promising to tell us more about The Mummy Returns later on, then never does so, and the other commentary by Kevin J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr & Arnold Vosloo which is quite entertaining all around.  Other added extras include Storyboard to Final Film Camparison, Pharaoh Lineage, Photograph Montage & some highlights from Mummy Returns as well as its trailer (the DVD-ROM extras are slightly different as well).  Add DTS sound and your choice of a Widescreen Version on Disc 1 or a Full Frame Version on Disc 2 and thats what you get on the Ultimate Edition that you wouldn't get on the Collector's Edition.  One thing also worth mentioning: The Collector's Edition of The Mummy included 2 Theatrical Trailers for the film, but the Ultimate Edition only bothers to include just one of them...why?
As far as the movie is concerned I think it's a lot of fun and a nice throwback to the swashbuckling films of the 30s and 40s.  A nice balance of action, humor and plot development which always propells the film forward.  The special effects are still amazing and, I'm sure, will hold up for many years to come.
So, as someone who has taken the time to collect all of Universal's Collector's Editions on DVD (Dante's Peak was the very first released in this format) and has also praised Universal Pictures for the fine work they have done, this whole ""Ultimate Edition"" stuff just feels like a slap in the face.  And as I see more and more of them being released it makes me consider waiting on Mummy Returns and The Grinch to see if Ultimate Editions come out a few months after the Collector's Editions are released.  I just don't see why studios feel the need to bleed the consumer dry, after all the support we've given into making this format flourish.  Just be careful when choosing.  If you're a collector like I am, you'll want all the extras, and it's beginning to get rather expensive with studios pulling this crap.  In other words....

The actors were really good, especially Oded Fehr who portrays Ardeth Bay(this guy is going to go places!). I told my older brother, who never likes some of the movies that I do to watch The Mummy. I had to buy my own copy of the movie that I bought cause my brother took it for himself! He likes the movie alot and thinks it's great to watch at night.
We are anxiously awaiting the release of The Mummy Returns on DVD so we can both watch the first movie together and then put into the DVD player the second one.

There are some really terrific special effects that will keep you intrigued, as well as some suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat!
I saw this movie at home, but really enjoyed it, even on the small screen.  I recommend this movie if you are looking for a fun action packed movie with humor and good looking people!",998524800,,615,4.267241379310345
3189388,5,B00004D2X8,"I just rented this movie a few days ago and watched it. I thought it was dynamic!
Brendan Raser plays Rick O'Connell, an adventurer who knows where the 'city of the dead', Hamunaptra, is. A librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her brother, Jonathan, convince Rick to lead them there: Jonathan so he can find the treasure of the pharoahs and Evelyn to find archaeological artifacts. Only when they get there, trouble immediately starts. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan carelessly resurrects the mummy of Imhotep when Evelyn reads from 'the book of the dead'. And not only has he become alive, he has the power to unleash the '10 plagues' and all the power of the gods. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan have to stop him, amidst fighting against undead warrior priests, flesh eating scarabs, and more!
It has all the characteristics of an Indiana Jones type movie, adventure, humor, and action. Except that ""The Mummy"" has something much more: Suspense. It wasn't just the horror that scared me, it was the suspense that got you. Almost half the time, I was watching ""The Mummy"" behind my pillow! Almost the whole movie they didn't really show anything, it was left up to your imagination. And I have a good imagination... Don't get me wrong, it WAS scary and suspenseful, yet there were plenty of funny parts which I was laughing so hard I was crying! I was actually impressed by Brendan Fraser's acting, too. I've seen him play in some really dumb movies like ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""George of the Jungle"" so I didn't know what to expect from him playing in an adventure movie. And he did a great job! This is a good movie to watch while eating popcorn at night with the lights turned off at home. I really want to try to get this DVD.

The movie is in widescreen format on disc 1 and full-frame format on disc 2, so you have a choice in viewing it.  And theres not just one, but three commentaries on the movie--  one by director Sommers and editor Ducsay, one by star Brendan Fraser, and one by co-stars Arnold (Imhotep)Vosloo, Oded (Ardeth Bay) Fehr, and Kevin J. (Beni) OConnor.  The behind-the-scenes stuff is fascinating, including the feature on building a better mummy, production notes, deleted scenes, photo gallery, and some very interesting and educational background information on ancient Egypt--its gods, kings, customs, mummies, artifacts, and even a map of the region.  And theres the customary movie trailers, cast & crew bios, chapter index, and a main menu which is written in hieroglyphics until you select an item, then its transformed into English--cute!  The image quality is great and the surround sound quality is awesome!
There are also some DVD-ROM features that look interesting, but I don't have a DVD-ROM drive on my PC, so I cant check them out.  Theres a trailer for the video game, though, and it looks like a fun game, with action and movement like Laura Croft in Tomb Raider.
The movie itself is an action-packed adventure yarn in the Indiana Jones tradition.  Brendan Fraser gives a stalwart performance as the two-fisted, two-pistol-packin hero, always ready for a fight or a quip, who joins would-be Egyptologist Rachel Weisz ('Evie) and her inept brother on an expedition to find the city of the dead, Hamunaptra, and the vast treasure of the Pharaohs.  Patricia Velazquez as Anck Su Namun, the Pharaohs mistress, is one of the treasures, a knock-out in her body makeup costume!
What they find, of course, is the tomb of Imhotep, the mummy, whom they carelessly resurrect, with all his supernatural powers and his evil intentions.  Its here that the special effects take over, and they're pretty outstanding as Imhotep literally puts himself together by using body parts of his victims!  Its quite a departure from the early Universal mummy movies and the later Hammer franchise, and it gives the mummy a more horrific element!  He doesnt just kill you, he cannibalizes you!  But despite the gruesomeness of this premise, the movie has very little gore in it, hence its PG-13 rating.  The special mummy effects are really  impressive, but its the darn cockroaches (Scarabs) that are really scary!
All in all, this DVD set does live up to its claim of being the ultimate edition.  I recommend it to all collectors and mummy fans!",997488000,,2613,4.956422018348624
3189392,4,B00004D2X8,"This is a light adventure film, with a lot of spectacular violence, horror and fear. It is situated in the mythic land of Pharoahs, and later in Egypt. It refers to strange practices and beliefs that are like a whole fantastic world of horror and magic. The Mummy is the result of a crime against one Pharoah, who was God on earth, punished by the priests in the most stringent way : momification when still alive. Then it is the release of that monster and the necessary steps to stop him. It is pure magic with a reference to the Plagues of Egypt and a complex religious world that has to do with bad (black) and good (golden) magic and formulas. It is a constant reference to the world of the dead, to the other side of our world, to the underworld of damnation that is organized on the same pattern as the real (pharaonic) world and that only has to do with keeping the dead and the Undead in check, under control. What happens when it gets out of hand ? The Undead is released and golden magic has to be found and used to bring in the supreme guardians of this underworld that have the power to make mortal the immortal, and hence give power to the living to kill the ex-immortal and rid the earth of the curse, scourge and calamity.
The exploration of this mythical world of Ancient Egypt remains partial and even superficial. The most accurate details are avoided to protect the public against real horror that is a lot more horrific than literary horror, even that of today. The special effects are also there to give that attractive look and feel that will capture some younger audience. We regret a little that those magical myths are not explored in more details, and we dream of  The Servant of the Bones  by Anne Rice, or even the coming  Queen of the Damned  by the same.
Entertaining and funny, and in the end the scholar-minded are the saviours of the world, and they get some kind of treasure as a reward, whereas the greedy are all destroyed, which is after all nothing but justice.

The love scene between Imhotep and Anck Su Namu was dramatic and unforgetable. The romatic development for Rick and Evelyn was equally good and delightful; and most importantly - it is believalbe. I really enjoyed watching interactions between Rick and Evelyn. How can you deny the scene, in which Evelyn got drunk, tried to kiss Rick and missed, is not one of the best romantic acting ever?  Do you notice the subtlness in Brendan's facial expressions?  Although this is an action movie, the personalities in this movie are more humane than the ones that are of the same genre.

They make it there and they find Imotep buried, the bad guy.  Some americans who are there find the book of the dead.  The girl steals (borrowed) the book and read from it, and revised Imotep.

It starts when the disembodied voice of Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) Narriates the story of how Imohtep (The Mummy, Arnold Vosloo) and Anck-Su-Namun (Potricia Volaqueus) murder Pharaoh Seti the First (Aharon Ipale'). The Med-ji, Pharaoh's Bodyguards mummify Imohtep after a feeble attempt to ressurect Anck-Su-Namun from the slaughter.  Imohtep suffers the Hum-Di the worst Egyptian Curse, meaning he gets nasty flesh-eating bugs poured all over him. Anyway three-thousand years later the embodied Ardeth Bay watches Men fight over Hamunaptra the city where Imohtep was buried. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) barely escapes with his life. Three years later after halarious library scene in which Evelen Carnahan (Rachel Weitz knocks over the whole library and a clever prision Scene in Cairo, Rick O'Connell Leads her and her brother Johnathan (John Hannah) to Hamunaptra. Four men also seeking hamunaptra open a cursed chest and Evelen foolishly reads from the book of the dead. Imohtep comes back to life unleashing the ten plagues of egypt which i will note is only five of the plagues. Imohtep sucks the people who opened the chest dry and regenerates. I can't give away the end In which Ardeth Bay, Rick and John combine forces to Kill Imohtep and rescue Evelen. Joining the film, the comic releif (besides Johnathan) Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner) and the prision Warden (Omid Djalili) and the Egyptoligyst (Johnathan Hyde). Stephen Dunham, Corey Johnsen, Tuc Watkins, (I feel sorry for his carachter) Erick Avri, and Bernard Fox, complete this wonderful film of humor action- adventure.

People down The Mummy and its awesome sequel for being filled with special effects and witty humour. I say, bring it on! The special effects in The Mummy were very interesting. Most were convincing, and breathtaking. Such as the recreation of Ancient Egypt, and the sand-wall. The watery spirit that went into Anck Su Namun was kind of campy, but fit into the movie. The casting was also great. Brendan Fraser was awesome as our hero, Rick O Connell. Fraser did well with his dialogue and actions, and was good with the one-liners. His reactions were funny too. Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Her character, Evelyn, went from being very clumsy (a cute scene) to being very brave (her face-off with mummified Anck Su Namun). John Hannah (Jonathan) was our comic relief, and so was Kevin J. O'Conner who played the wimpy Beni. Oded Fehr made a good co-hero, and Arnold Voosloo was the villian, the mummy. Voosloo has the creepiest eyes, so that fit well with his character. As for the dvd itself, picture and audio are great. I think the deleted scenes should've been kept in as to they were interesting, and added more action and suspense. But I guess they took them out for length.

They hire dashing American Rick O'Connell to take them there, not knowing that Hamunaptra is the resting place of the evil-to-the-core Imhotep, (former) high priest of Osiris and.  Imhotep is undead, t. i. his soul is stil locked to this world, and has tolerated the most horrible of Egyptian curses - the Hom-Dai - for 3000 years.  He was the only man ever to be cursed this way, for his crime was to sleep with the Pharaoh's mistress (Anck-su-namun), kill the Pharaoh and defy the gods in an attempt to undo Anck-su-namun's suicide.
When Evelyn accidentally releases Imhotep from his grave, and with him the ten plagues of Egypt, the now-immortal Imhotep is bent on one thing:  Bringing Anck-su-namun back to life.  This he can do in one way:  He must find the Book of the Dead, its key, Anck-su-namun's mummy, and one human female.  He will then perform the ritual for raising Anck-su-namun's soul out of the underworld, insert the soul in the mummy, and kill the person, so Anck-su-namun's soul may be united with a ""fresh"" body.
He has chosen his victim:  Evelyn.
Now it is up to Rick (and Jonathan) to save Evy and send Imhotep back to the underworld - before it is too late!

A second disc contains a zoomed-in full-screen presentation which was previously available as a separate 'Special Edition' (along with the same extras as found on both widescreen discs). This 'close-up version' is very revealing of subtle nuances such as the expressions on actors' faces which are hard to read in a shrunk-down letterbox (or VHS transfer) and since the camera is always moving, you still get to see the glorious movie-set on either side. In addition to the mutitude of extras found on the previous 'special edition' (and Disc One of this set) Disc-Two includes a collection of (letterboxed) trailers and a preview of 'The Mummy Returns' which revealed a little too much of the plot for those who haven't seen it yet. Disc-Two also features some storyboard-to-finished-movie comparisons with the two letterboxed frames stacked one above the other. There are some before-and-after special-effects sequences similar to those found in the 'Building A Better Mummy' featurette but which replay the corresponding sequence from the full-screen version. Almost hidden away in the elaborate menu is a photo-montage which is accompanied by over four minutes of isolated Jerry Goldsmith score recorded in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. Probably because of the extra detail in the picture, there is no room for DTS on Disc Two.
If you already own the widescreen or full-frame 'special edition' of this title, it's worth buying the Ultimate Edition for the alternate framing, DTS option and 'The Mummy Returns' preview.

Subsequent viewings have improved the film. I enjoy it more each time as I catch new subtlties and nice touches - one of the things for which DVD is so well suited. The special effects, about which so much has been said, are nothing short of phenomenal.
The extras on this Ultimate Edition DVD are excellent. An entire second disc is devoted to such goodies as a fairly thorough listing of Egyptian gods, maps, and other fascinating details of ancient Egyptian life. Several language tracks, spot on surround sound options, featurettes, commentary and trailers, plus previews of the new sequel round out the package.
I'd have liked some outtakes - they'd go particularly well with this genre of movie - and some deleted scenes, but otherwise this Ultimate Edition DVD is the total package.

3189418,4,B00004D2X8,"One of my favorite features of DVD technology is the ability to add a voice-over commentary to the film.  ""The Mummy"" Ultimate edition DVD has three; one with director Stephen Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay, one with star Brendan Fraser, and another with Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy), Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay), and Kevin J. O'Connor (Beni).
The commentary with Sommers and Ducsay is perhaps the most revealing of the three.  The filmakers are suprisingly honest and candid about the process of making the film.  Sommers frequently expresses his frustration at dealing with extras (uncredited actors) and isn't above pointing out the mistakes in his own movie (watch for the arm of a crew member to pop into frame during the bar scene).
Fraser's commentary, on the other hand, is more like watching an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Though he reveals a little about his part in making the film, you can tell he is enjoying himself just as much as you are, if not more.  At times he breaks out laughing as if he's seeing the film for the first time (witness his reaction to Beni's multilingual chanting when first coming face to face with The Mummy).
The commentary with Vosloo, Fehr and O'Connor is informative but my least favorite of the three.  Vosloo loves to talk and does a lot of it, often interrupting his costars to tell a story or plug the sequel (another thing he does a lot of).
In short, if you enjoyed ""The Mummy"" and frequent the trivia section of Internet Movie Database, you'll enjoy the commentaries attatched to this film.  You'll never look at the movie the same again.",988848000,,1593,4.729241877256317

So a note to DVD fans; the only difference between this version and the original ""Collectors Edition"" is a few added interviews and the inclusion of a DTS mix of the soundtrack. The picture transfer itself is exactly the same, which is saying a lot since it is reference quality. (Especially on a 16x9 display through component video inputs). If your sound/home theater system is equipped for it, check out the DTS mix - it is, in many respects, better than the Dolby Digital mix on the first disc (better channel separation and richer bass and vocal tones), but again, only if your system is set up for it will you notice any difference. If not, (and if you're not a die-hard fan of the film) there's no need to re-buy this one; however, if you've got the amps and the equipment, this one is a sure way to show off what a good home theater system can do - and blow away your friends at the same time!

Everyone has a different opinion on its taste, texture, health content,etc. But it boils down to did you like it enough to eat it again?  Movies are the same thing, everyone has different opinions on the movies, its acting, special effects, closness to the original (if a remake), etc.  But it boils down to this did you have fun watching the movie and would you watch it again.
To me movies are just that entertainment, anyone that tries to take anything else away from a movie needs to get laid (pardon the language).  The only reason I watch movies other than documentaries is to be entertained and escape reality for awhile.
The Mummy did that for me.  Sure the acting wasn't the best but it was fine for this movie.  The special effects were awesome and justify sitting through this movie and owning it.
Was it better than the original.  I don't think that is the question that needs to be answered.  The orignal is a classic and will stand in time as one of the best.  When I saw this movie I decided not to compare it to the original, I wanted to watch it as its own entity.  I did and without any preconceived expectations I enjoyed the movie.
Bottom line is that this is a fine movie to go see and own.  Don't judge it on the original, just enjoy it and be entertained and you will be fine.
There are to many reviewers that pick a movie apart and trash them.  People we don't care, did you know that people don't watch or not watch a movie because of your review.  People will want to watch it and make their own judgement.

This movie can not compare to Stargate or Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie is just another example that Hollywood prefers special effects over story. I was able to watch the whole movie without much trouble, but everything was so cliche and stereotyped. As far as horror, there was none--nothing on the point of burying your face in your hands. In my mind, a really good film is one that you remember a LONG time after you've seen it. Not so with this film. In fact, I only thought about writing this review because I heard that a sequel was coming out.

3189425,4,B00004D2X8,"If you buy/rent/watch this movie with the expectation of seeing something akin to oscar-bait, then you're going to be seriously disappointed. However, if you watch this movie with the only expectation of being entertained, I believe you'll really like it, if not love it. The script is a spinoff of the original Mummy, but with an updated theme -- and naturally with the new writer and director's personal touches. Since the basic plot and storyline have been covered by the editorial reviews and several personal reviews, I won't bother to repeat what they've already said. But, since so many people seem to have given this movie poor reviews because they (for some reason) thought this movie was going to be a duplicate of the original, even though it says everywhere that it's not (can they read?), I will reiterate this point -- Don't expect a clone of the original Mummy, because this isn't it. Watch the movie without any preconceived notions, and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more..... It's an adaptation of the original Mummy with basically the sameplot.... Aside from the opening scene depecting the French Foreign Legion preparing to do battle with the native troops (which, I will remind that poster, actually was something that happened frequently during the period of time the movie is set in!), the only ""army"" of ""people"" the main characters go about trying to destroy are mummies!  So shouldn't that phrase actually be ""defeating an army of computer animated (you know, not real?) UNDEAD""? And the last time I checked, ""undead"" wasn't really considered a race...
Finally, sure the script is a bit cheesy, but the fantastic special effects make up for its few shortcomings in my opinion, and the acting really isn't as bad as some people seem to have so harshly criticized. It's a fun movie, IF you'll allow yourself to enjoy it for what it is, instead of trying to compare it to what it's not  -- i.e., the original Mummy or any Indiana Jones movies (which by the way, the original Mummy that this movie was based on was created LONG before any Indy movies). Once again, if you're looking for oscar-bait, this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for an entertaining way to spend an evening with a bowl of popcorn, then give The Mummy a try - you'll probably like it.",988156800,,2287,4.7727272727272725

3189427,5,B00004D2X8,"There is no way this film can be taken seriously, which is good because it makes it all the more enjoyable.  Brendan Fraser hams it up delightfully as the roguish ex-legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is roped in (forgive the dreadful pun!) into helping Egyptologist Evelyn played by Rachel Weisz to locate the lost city of Hamunaptra and its many wonderful treasures.  Unfortunately Hamunaptra has many secrets, some of them very, very nasty and the nastiest secret of all is the evil priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo.  I have to admit Arnold Vosloo made the film for me, as did the young woman who played the Pharaoh's mistress and his lover, Patricia Velazquez, she was superb, shame she had such a small part in the film!  The special effects were amazing, and the humour rib chucklingly funny.  I mean who can forget the moment when Imhotep's still decomposing body falls out of the coffin and Rick, Evelyn and her brother Jonathan played stupendously by John Hannah look at each other and say simultaneously, ""he's still so.......JUICY!""  I howled with both laughter and fright.  This is a great film with some gruesome moments but mostly in my opinion this is a comedy of horrors that makes you both jump and laugh in fright.  I won't give away anymore of the plot but it is worth seeing and a double disc compellation special makes it twice as good.

It seemed to me to be a poor imitation of the Indy films. However, after watching it several times since then, I have come to enjoy the movie much more.
Brendan Fraser's O'Connel starts off as an Indy wannabe. However, by the time the final credits role, he has become his own character. Much of the plot is taken from Universal's orignial THE MUMMY, but this time instead of a Mummy who strangles people to death, the Mummy sucks out the life from his victims and spews forth plagues from his mouth. The special effects are magnificient and though the acting is a bit cheesy, one must not forget that this is not a dramatic masterpiece. The movie is filled with humor, taking away from some of the more gruesome points in the film.  Overall, the tongue-in-cheek revamp of the original THE MUMMY, along with the great special effects make this fun movie a tasty piece of mind-candy.",987120000,,1055,4.494791666666667

3189434,4,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is one of those unique movies that really delivers in all fields. It's a rip-roaring adventure in the vein of the Indianna Jones films, while incorporating chills and humor into its story as well. It has all the basics of the 1932 original version of the movie, but this version is much peppier, much more entertaining, and takes on both a serious and a comedic approach. This, combined with the use of cutting-edge special effects and a knockout cast of actors, make the movie a prime example of typical summer fun that turns into a lot more than just that.
Borrowing the plot of the old movie, the high priest Imhotep is condemned to forever be cursed for having a torrid love affair with the Pharaoh's mistress, Anck-Su-Namun. He is given a ritual burial, which involves being buried alive in a coffin full of flesh-eating scarabs. This gives the movie a chance to show itself off as fashionable horror, not going into the extremely graphic details while giving us slight chills in the spine. This will carry on throughout the rest of the film, which is one of its better aspects.
Moving ahead in the film to the 1930's, Rick O'Connell, a roughneck who also has his charms, crosses paths with librarian Evelyn Carnahan and her gold-digging brother Jonathon, who has a map that leads to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. O'Connell agrees to take them there, and soon, it becomes a race of who will get there first to retrieve the treasure rumored to be hidden there. Upon investigating the interiors of the city, they come across a book, and soon they unleash Imhotep and all of his curses on the world. This is the point at which the movie becomes a race against time to stop the mummy before he completes the steps to becoming whole again.
The movie has a lot going for it, and the fact that it realizes its status as an action adventure/romance is what keeps it going. The movie never really stops moving; there are certain scenes that move a bit slower to allow for character development and such, but this movie is mostly fast-paced action and thrills, delivering a tense and throttling experience which will make you cheer and smile. When the plagues begin descending upon the land, our heroes must move even faster to stop the curse, and as they do, so does the movie.
The movie is undeniably fun. There is a lot of comic relief thrown into the mix of the plot, and is a combination of one-liners from characters as well as goofy body language and actions which will have you rolling with laughter. The character of Beni is the centerpiece for the comic relief; he is the turncoat who deserts the Americans to aide Imhotep in his search for the items he needs to regenerate. He is cumbersome and gangly, and the quiver in his voice is a riot. one scene in particular involves Beni pulling out a collection of sacred symbols and chanting foreign verses to try and ward of the mummy. Comic genius!
There are a lot of special effects employed for this film, and they do well in telling the story where regular camera shots could not. The most stunning of these effects is the ongoing regeneration of the mummy, who goes from moldy, rotting corpse to partial skin and muscles, slowing becoming whole. The many layers of his body are seen in meticulous detail, each movement matched to the specific body part. These effects are seamless, and work very well in this film. Most of the other effects involve the plagues brought down by Imhotep, which include immense sandstorms and flocks of scarabs. The scarabs are the most believable effect here, and through animation, the filmmakers are able to create thousands of them, creating the illusion that danger comes in numbers.
There is also some moments that border on the extreme, but not entirely, and the movie is admirable in the way that it does not cross that line. The regeneration sequences show Imhotep's form as being dried out instead of wet and gooey, which makes us go ""Ew"" without making us vomit. As Imhotep takes his victims one by one, the filmmakers show this by using lots of sound effects and creating the illusion instead of showing us the actual event. All we see are the leftovers, which, like Imhotep, are dry and decrepit.
The cast employed for the movie is remarkable, and gives us one of the best performances for a film of this genre ever. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, and he is the ideal embodiment of an action hero. He's not so much a young Indianna Jones as he is his own action figure, and his character becomes something for other action heroes to be modeled after. Rachel Weisz is sweet and humorous as the lovely Evelyn, and she also makes a remarkable damsel in distress as well. She has guts, which is wonderfully portrayed in her acting ability and charisma. Arnold Vosloo plays the evil Imhotep, the perfect person for the role. He makes us believe in the fact that the mummy is not really evil; he is only doing what he was destined to do by reviving his long-lost love. Two of the supporting roles, John Hannah as Jonathon, Evelyn's brother, and Kevin J. O'Conner as Beni, do a masterful job of adding comedy and liveliness to the story,
As a serious horror film, ""The Mummy"" would not be as good. It would seem more confused and muddled. It's light-heartedness and comedy make it something better, giving us a healthy, even balance of laughs, thrills and chills. It's a movie for young and old alike, and becomes an interesting spin on the original. It gives the old story a fresh look while keeping the old scare tactics used before.

3189436,2,B00004D2X8,"This film is one in a long line of films hyped to the point where the public is brainwashed into seeing it.  The premise of The Mummy seemed simple enough, remake a classic feature in the Universal Pictures archives, throw in some low budget stars, hire the guy who do effects on Star Wars and you can't miss.  Well, even that wasn't enough to make the film flimsy.
Brendan Fraser is Rick O'Connell, a man of adventure who pretty much has to be cajoled by John Carnohan and his sister Evelyn to help them in their quest to find the tomb of Imhotep.  Upon finding the tomb, they not only break a sacred seal, but unleash the mummy who must collect various incanter beacons to return to his full flesh form.
First of all, Brendan Fraser is not an action hero!  He has about as much clout as Keanu Reeves.  Not once did I believe that this guy could be an action star.  It seemed that this was Brendan saying ""All right!  I'll never be Indiana Jones, but here's as close as I'll ever get!""
The pacing of the story and other characters also fall through, the comedy relief is tepid, as is Rachel Weisz as Evelyn.  Like a character out of thet Indiana Jones series, she is the girl who is the misfit who eventually turns out beuatiful in the end, but she has a major attitude problem towards the leading man (think Willie Scott from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).
The only saving grace for this film that gave it 2 stars was the effects work by Industrial Light & Magic. The Mummy is about the most recognizable full-body motion capture figure since ILM created the T-1000 for Terminator 2.",983318400,,1593,4.394557823129252
3189437,5,B00004D2X8,"When this film was released in 1999, many critics bad-mouthed this movie, comparing it to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Fortunately, most of us didn't listen to them and the Mummy made almost as much as the Matrix. The comparisions are not fair, Raiders was more of an adventure movie with a serious tone, the Muumy is a homage to all the great monster flicks of the Silver Screen.
Incorporated in this film is plenty of humor, mostly one-liners by Brendan Frasier, who plays the swashbuckling hero out to stop the undead creature. Rachel Weisz plays the feisty heroine who is out to uncover the mythical lost city of Hamunaptra, which is said to contain the ""wealth of Egypt"". Her brother is played by John Hannah, as her brother, who is out not for scientific gain, but for personal wealth. Frasier leads them because he was there at the city once, and is going back in search of treasure, with the funding of Weisz's character.
But treasure-hunting soon turns into mummy-hunting as they awaken the long-dead priest Imhotep, who is now out to restore his body and revive his deceased lover. What follows is a great mixture of horror and adventure, with some of the best special effects ever in a movie.
As for the DVD, the picture is excellent, even for a DVD, with terrific color representation and very good digital sound reproduction.

My girlfriend leaned over to me and asked, ""Is this a comedy?"" What happened here, this is supposed to be a horror movie, not a slapstick comedy. I enjoyed Steven Sommer's Deep Rising, but this is ludicrous. Fraser churns out the typical Hollywood tough guy character. Rachel Weisz, is nice to look at, but not to listen to. The special effects are decent enough, but they seem to be more important in the movie than the actual conflict.

3189445,4,B00004D2X8,"""The Mummy"" is a wonderful, suspenseful, adventurous, and romantic movie.  It also turned the spark of interest I had in ancient Egypt into a full blown bonfire. Not to mention the movie is packed with gorgeous and fairly talented actors--such as Arnold Vosloo (who portrays Imhotep very well despite not speaking a word of English...or any other modern tongue...throughout the entire movie.), Oded Fehr, Brendan Fraser, and Patricia Velasquez (whose role was minor yet integral to the film).
However, they could have spent less money on special effects and more on historical accuracy.  There are several historical goofs...both subtle and glaring.  I was a little put off when, after a lovely shot of the Giza Pyramids, a baritone-voiced narrator said that it was ""Thebes.""

Actual sample dialogue: ""we're in big trouble."" Followed by the Mummy growling even louder and then, ""We're in REALLY big trouble.""

Well, the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"" is quite comfortable being ""Chopper"" instead of ""Yacky Doodle"".  There is plenty of bite with absolutely THE BEST DVD widescreen audio and visual technology available! (we'll leave the more sophisticated and intellectual version to Boris).  Either way, it's a great show since it avoids serious accidents, and the ""blood plasma"" never gets mixed up!  Rachel Weisz puts on a ""Snagglepuss"" of a performance, and steals the show outright!  Her finest moment may have been the somewhat overlooked but excellent acting she displayed while walking the mysteriously moving ladder (something more likely to happen to ""Scooby Doo""), and then having to explain the entire strange sequence of events to her rigid, no nonsense boss (the ""Mr. Ranger"" type)!  Brendan Fraser is reduced to ""second fiddle"" despite his ""Quick Draw McGraw antics both before and after Rachel bails him out of his incarcerated ""George of the Jungle"" dilemma.  Perhaps the hangman's words to Rachel's character offers the best summary: ""Are you telling me that this filthy, godless, son of a pig (not ""Porky"") knows how to find the city of the dead!!??""  Fraser couldn't seem to make up his mind if he wanted to be ""Pixie"" or ""Dixie"" throughout the entire two hours so he settled for ""Secret Squirrel"" (after all, he had all the tools and knowledge that everyone needed).  Oh Doctor!  Does Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor (no relation to Zsa Zsa or Eva I suspect)) need some medical treatment after ""bugging"" the audience (not to mention our heroes) as the weasel villain personified??!!  After his type of ""dishonorable discharge"", not even the likes of ""Snoop and Blabber"" could track him down!  No less than seven, countem, seven, actors portrayed ""The Mummy""--Not even granny's ""Precious Pup"" would dare sneer at that obsessive, compulsive example of pulling out all the stops!!  All things considered, our characters are ruff 'n ready for a big blast of special effects and old fashioned fun--Even if it's not an old fashioned movie!

3189457,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 movie starring Boris Karloff as the title character.  Except, this one has really cool special effects to the hilt.  In 1932, Boris Karloff walked around REALLY slow, grunted like he was constipated, then he strangled people, again, REALLY slowly, to kill them.
 This time around, our mummy can open his mouth very wide, and spew locusts all over Egypt, along with several other annoying plagues.  Can you imagine some Egyptian woman, starts yelling at her husband, ""BILL!  For the last time, put in for that transfer....Yesterday the rivers were blood, today it's raining fire.  I can't handle all the plagues around here!""
 If you enjoy the Indian Jones trilogy, you'll enjoy The Mummy.  Actually, skip the Temple of Doom, that one was a real stinker, but The Mummy falls nicely into the wacky, action flick genre with some archeological fringe for a little depth.  I wonder if movies like this one annoy real, honest-to-God archaeologists.  I mean, it makes it look like archaeology is a matter of finding a really cool looking map, get yourself to the X, then, with your trusty native sidekick, dig until you find something, like the leafy outfits Adam and Eve wore when they figured out they were naked.  I mean, how COOL!  If it was that easy, everyone would do it!  Hold your horses, the summary is coming up next.  The year is 1290 B.C.  The High Priest Imhotep and the Pharaoh's main squeeze, Anck-Su-Namun are a little bit too smitten with each other.  The Pharaoh finds them, they make like a sushi chef and chop chop, see ya later Pharaoh.  But the guards rush in, and Anck-Su-Namun does herself in while Imhotep fleas, vowing to bring her back to life.
 As Imhotep is performing his ""Bring Girlfriend Back to Life"" chant, he and his loyal followers are all mummified and buried.  BUT, Imhotep is buried alive along with a lot of really nasty scarabs who lick their chops at the thought of eating a big tasty evil guy.  Next comes the ""oh, of COURSE"" ditty.  They put a curse on this guy.  And not just any curse, mind you.  They put a curse on him which is reserved for the most evil, sinful, wicked baddest dude.  It would be a pretty lame movie if he got the curse reserved for the 17th worst guy.
 Along with the curse, is the ""Don't Wake This Guy Up"" clause.  Ya know, waking up a mummy can't ever be a good thing.  Think about it.  You've got your ten plagues, and aside from that, you've got a guy who hasn't seen a bar of soap in 3000 years.
 So, what happens?  We fast forward to the year 1923.  We have the dashing French Foreign Legionnaire Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), and Evelyn, the little rich girl with the ability to read ancient Egyptian and decipher hieroglyphics.  Other members of the wagontrain include: Evelyn's brother who's a lush, a wiry fellow named Beni and some uncouth, rowdy Americans.
 This band sets off across the desert to find Hamunaptra, where it is believed that the wealth of Egypt was buried at one time.  So whose bright idea was it to also make Hamunaptra the City of the DEAD?  Hellooooooo?  Think about it first people, I mean, really.
 As one would guess, woopsie doodle, somebody opens Imhotep's sarcophagus.  Then, well, darn the luck, somebody is accidentally reading that little part in the Black Book of the Dead that brings Mr. Musty back to life.
 The thing that's great about this movie, is that all the gore is off-screen.  Meaning, you might hear the scream or see the shadow, but not witness the actual removal of someone's eyeballs or what have you.  Another great thing, they are way too busy for a gratuitous sex scene.  I appreciate an action flick that doesn't have the male and female leads stop and say, ""I realize there's a big stinky mummy chasing after us, but let's smooch.""
 You can watch the movie to catch the rest of the story.  The informational stuff is fun. Getting pieces of information to keep you in the story until the climax.  The Mummy did that really well, I felt, because historical exposition can be really boring if what you really want to see is a dead guy scaring everyone.
 This movie is a lot of fun, the action is quick and the special effects are really cool.  There are one-liners galore, they poke fun at Americans, and they make fun of the very genre the movie is.  You'll be entertained.",970358400,,4331,4.5708712613784135

3189459,4,B00004D2X8,"To compare this film with the classic original is, to say the least, like  comparing apples and oranges.  The 1932 Boris Karloff film is a suspenseful  and highly original romantic horror film with depth to spare, while the  1999 version is little more than a high-tech, fun-filled action-adventure  fantasy film with a few chills and thrills along the way.  But in that it  is excellent!
Now be assured that the original accomplishes its goals  with a great deal more success than the new film does.  While it is a  fast-paced, highly imaginative adaptation, whatever heart is left from the  original story, tends to be overshadowed by the excessive but typically  excellent ILM computer graphics.  The script is somewhat weakened by the  dialogue which, at times, sounds too modern for the mid- 1920's.  But the  plot and storyline, which was adapted by director Stephen Sommers, is so  involving and the players so appealing you just can't help but get caught  up in the atmosphere.  And to be honest, it would have been hard if not  totally impossible to make a more exact remake of the original that could  have stood on its own.  The 1932 film was nearly perfect and you can't  improve on perfection.
Brendan Fraser cuts a dashing and appealing figure  as the typical action-adventure hero definitely in the mold of Indiana  Jones.  He is matched every step of the way by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn, the  librarian turned explorer.  Their scenes together show a chemistry that  could result in being cast in other movies together.  John Hannah as  Evelyn's brother Jonathan is once again very appealing.  He never fails to  impress me with his way of wrapping himself around a character.  And Kevin  J. O'Connor as weasel Beni is very funny and quite perfect.
Arnold Vosloo  paints an entirely different picture as the title character, A.K.A.  Im-Ho-Tep.  Again, while comparisons with the original should be avoided, I  feel compelled to say that Mr. Karloff's performance in the original is an  incredibly heartfelt and soulful one.  Of all the characters in both films  this is the one that should have the most substance.  But as depicted in  the remake, Im-Ho-Tep is the most superficial of all.  Vosloo, largely due  to the script and aforementioned computer graphics, has little else to do  but bare his rather well-developed chest which, in my humble opinion, is  largely the reason for his appeal in this film with so many of the viewers.  But his performance is as shallow as they come.  Still, he attempts to  combine eroticism and sexuality with evil and is at least partially  successful.
The editing and photography are superb and the music score by  the great Jerry Goldsmith adds a great deal.  Director Sommers shows a  command for the action-adventure genre that should be explored further in  future films and his script blends adventure and comedy beautifully.
The  DVD looks and sounds great.  Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay provide an  informative and very entertaining commentary that really takes you behind  the scenes of the making of the film.  The other supplements include the  usual documentary and deleted scenes.  There is also a special section that  details how the special and visual effects were created.  These features as  well as many others make the disc well worth [the price].  But just a word of advice: get the widescreen  edition.  This film, as well as most other standard editions of films,  loses too much when the viewer can only see half the picture.
All in all,  THE MUMMY-1999 should stand on its own, separate and apart from the  original.  For my money, I'll always love the Karloff film more (you can  read my review of that one elsewhere at amazon.com), but isn't it nice to  know that here the filmmakers were able to take that original premise and  craft an enjoyable, fast-paced comedy-fantasy-adventure that works very  well.  After all, in this case, what more could one ask for!",969235200,,3941,4.8812785388127855

Now it is going after them since they  broke the curse. Do they have time to destroy the mummy before the world  comes to an end. This is a good action epic, visual effect, and great story  telling. With great actors like Brendan Fraiser, Rachel Weisz,John  Hannan,Jonathon Hyde,Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo. This is a great  movie to see.",969062400,,676,4.387096774193548
3189461,4,B00004D2X8,"The Mummy is, at heart, an adventure serial from the 1930's, which means  it is in the same genre as the Indiana Jones films. While it never achieves  the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has  its moments.
The cast, for the most part, is outstanding. Brendan Fraser  plays another variation on his hunky-cartoon persona, swaggering and  swashbuckling like an old pro. Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love  interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's. The chemistry between the  two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.
Arnold Vosloo makes  a somewhat disappointing mummy, however. He never seems very menacing --  largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a  mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.
Whether or  not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you  feel about computer animation. There are some shots, particularly of the  mummy, that look like low-grade ""Hercules&Xena"" quality  effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial  Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have  looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).
Regardless,  the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun. There is an element of ""Army  of Darkness"" style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers  some good old-fashioned thrills and chills.
No one will ever mistake The  Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too slick, too post-modern, and at times  embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around  spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).

3189469,3,B00004D2X8,"This movie treads that ever so warn road of the evil mummy, and how warn it is too. A subject that is simply an old richual for its leaders is as  ever manipulated into Hollywood using an evil mummy to exploit that ever  mythical idea that mummies are nasty things that walk with out-stretched  arms.
To be fair this is a good adaptation of the whole Egypt subject,  yet while it is extremely pleasing on the eye, it is very difficult to  follow this as it seems to rely on coincidence far more than just the odd  scene. The effects are big budget and fantastic, and to go with it the  acting is, in the main, brilliant. British stars who are more known in  their native England for TV roles - John Hannah and Rachel Weisz - are as  ever good performers, though the lead from Brendan Fraser is at times  wooden.
The script is basic, and very predictable, if you can't guess  what is gonna happen most the way through - then it will be a surprise. In  the nick of time lives are saved, sure death situations find Fraser  escaping, and rather cheesily the bad mummy is defeated and the guy gets  the girl at the end. No surprises there then.
The movie is by no means  all bad - it has a quirky script, and original character settings and the  it generally ties together well as a plot, despite being far-fetched this  is just for a bit of fun, for we all know mummies will not just appear. The  kind of holes in this though are clear, and a good example is when the town  is bombed and you see buildings destroyed - yet at the end, they are  magically all pristine again - could this be the ever present magic of the  mummy, or something we are supposed to miss as they create the typical  idyllic ending for the relationship ending.
Basicallyt his is a no  surprises film, which is easily predictable and rather cheesy in the route  it takes. It is a subject matter that is interpreted in a manipulated way  to create a good versus bad situation as realism goes out the wondow. To be  fair, if you select this kind of topic realism is never going to be key.  For all its low points on the topic and plot, it does hang well together,  and the acting is in the main good, and the story is not laboured and  despite sitting there crossing off every cheesy manoeuver and coincidence,  this is at least pleasing to watch in general, and the subject matter of  Egypt is interesting. Not something to expect much from, and not really  something to get excited about, but if you like a run of the mill big  budget movie you'll at least enjoy the movie - although you will spot all  through the formula that is used far too often in recent years......!",965088000,,2642,4.292089249492901

Back to the movie:  it was a lot  of fun.  Brendan Fraser kept me laughing.  The characters were pretty well  drawn.  And all the expendables were somehow still endearing.  John Hannah  was standout.  Very funny guy.  ""Bad luck, old mum,"" and  ""Im-ho-tep,"" were probably the funniest lines in the whole movie.  The special effects were stunning and the action was pulse pounding.
A  couple of quibbles with minor spoilers:  if the beetles ate Imhotep,  ""very slowly,"" in the words of the female lead, then how come  they devoured that poor guy in the passageway in like .5 seconds?  And how  come the Imhotep took the eyes of Burns, who wore glasses?  I expected to  see the mummy staggering around like Burns did when his glasses wer knocked  off.

3189477,5,B00004D2X8,"I think those who have criticised this movie have made the mistake of comparing it to true horror films.
To place the 1999 Mummy beside the Karlof version is a mistake. I agree that The Mummy (1999) owes far more to  Raiders of the Lost Ark than the tense, claustrophobic horror classic of  the 1930s.
It's supposed to be fun. Even the cast don't take themselves  seriously and there are some superb moments of pure slapstick fun. I  particularly enjoyed the character Beni as the bumbling, hapless, wanna-be  arch villain who probably endures more pain than Imhotep.
I note the  movie has also endured criticism for not being historically accurate. Well,  that's neither here nor there. In reality Imhotep was a renowned architect  and High Priest. Our guy is something else entirely! He is a work of pure  fiction, as are the rest of the cast - Seti existed, but whether he was  murdered by his staff and his girlfriend or not, who knows, but probably  not. Ankhesenamen (Imhotep's girlfriend) also existed..she was the wife of  Tutankhamen.
The Mummy does not pretend to be an historical docu-drama,  nor a serious horror film. If you approach it with this mind set then you  will be disappointed.
It's an adventure story, full of action, handsome  heros,lovely heroines and great special effects and self-deprecating  humour. (I actually prefer the ""juicy"" mummy, with bones clanking  and flesh rotting, to the bandage wrapped guys)
The only sour note from  my perspective are the myriads of silly ""priest mummies"" that  swarm all over the place toward the end. Far more than Imhotep had in his  employ when they were all alive; they are all rather exaggerated to the  point of being plain foolish, rather than funny.
Overall, The Mummy is  great chewing gum for the mind and what is wrong with that. I recommend it  and I am eagerly looking forward to Mummy 2.",961200000,,1865,4.79559748427673

There is kinda of a touching romance between the lovely young  British girl and Brendan Fraser's character. However, the more enjoyable  charasters were young lady's brother and a shady ""Eastern"" man,  who was looking for some wealth and adventure on somebody else's  expense.
The story of the Mummy itself and of some strange men in black,  calling themselves Mummy guardians or something like that, is completely  preposterous.

3189493,5,B00004D2X8,"When it comes to movie genres, horror is in my top five,probably after science fiction. However, the remake of the Mummy isnot a horror in the traditional sense. Most people associate modern horror with gore-laden special effects, forgetting that true fear comes from the unknown and urgency developed from carefully built up suspense. The 1999 remake of the Mummy isn't a horror film, unlike perhaps the Sixth Sense-which I wouldn't show my nieces or nephews, but the Mummy is just good clean fun. We are treated to a great ensemble of actors, breath taking sets and funky special effects, thanks to Industrial Light and Magic. The film also doesn't take itself at all seriously, making you laugh just as surely as you will thrill to the action sequences.
 The film opens with a stunning view of Thebes-city of the Seti the First where we see the sphinx under construction (okay, so they missed by a few hundred miles on that one!).  Anck-su-namun, the Pharaoh's untouchable mistress is continuing her affair with Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo)-a priest of probably Anubis. Getting caught in the act by Seti, they kill him just as the Medjai (who were actually the Egyptian police force) break down the doors. Anck-su-namun then kills herself as Imhotep escapes after promising to resurrect her. He and his priests steal Anck-su-namun's body and take it to Hamunaptra where he attempts to do that, but all is lost when the Medjai storm the sarneche where her body was being prepared. Imhotep is mummified alive for his crimes-cursed to spend an eternity undead locked within a sarcophagus, being eaten by nasty little scarab beetles.
 Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, a down on his luck Legionaire who led his garrison to the legendary city of Hamunaptra-the city of the dead in 1923 (Note: the city didn't really exist and is based possibly on the Necropolis of Egypt). They find the city, oh yes, but they also find hundreds a Tuareg warriors bent on killing everyone to prevent them from find the evil that dwells beneath the sand. O'Connell escapes after being chased too close to the statue of Anubis where Imhotep is buried and a small sand storm that whips up around the statue that frightens off his attackers, allowing O'Connell to escape with his life. The next time we see him it's three years later and he's about to be hanged for having a very good time.
 It is in Cairo where we meet Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), a beautiful and befuddled librarian desperate to prove herself an archaeologist to the sexist old-boy network in England. Rachel delivers a beautiful performance of the slightly nerdy expert of Egyptology. We also meet her lush brother, Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah), who has stolen a puzzle box key from O'Connell that has a map to the fabled city of Hamunaptra. The two rush to find Rick after Evelyn's boss `accidentally' burns the map in a candle flame. They find him at the Cairo Prison where Evelyn must bargain with sleazy warden for O'Connell's life by promising him 25% of the riches they find in the fabled city.
 From there the adventure of a life time comes to life as O'Connell reluctantly agrees to lead Evelyn and her brother, and the sleazy warden, across the desert sands to the ancient city. They also have a run in with the `bloody Americans', who are out to plunder Hamunaptra's riches, and the two groups must work together in order to survive-first by an attack by the Medjai, then after finding the Book of the Dead, Evelyn incants a spell that kind of...sort of...brings Imhotep back to life, whose sarcophagus they found earlier that day. The Americans steal Anck-su-namun's canopic jars-the vessels that stored her organs after they were removed. As the mummy comes back to life, it becomes a race to escape back to Cairo, followed by Imhotep who begins to kill the American thieves one at a time for their crime, using their life essence to rejuvenate himself in the process. Imhotep also develops a crush on Evelyn, who he plans to sacrifice so that Anck-su-namun many live again.
 The Mummy, start to finish, is a wild romp that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Thanks mostly to the interplay between the main characters who play off each other magically. It doesn't set out solely to scare, but does offer up some genuinely creepy moments. With exemplary production values-be they sets, effects or costumes, The Mummy delivers heaps of action, laughs and adventure of a type akin to Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fine pedigree to follow. But the Mummy also harkens back to a time when movies were made with a certain eye to quality-there is nothing in the film that made me lose my suspension of disbelief, because it is a solidly written yarn. It has unforgettable moments, be it O'Connell's back stabbing friend Beni as he runs through a collection of holy symbols and prayers in attempt to stave off the advancing mummy. Or Rick and Evelyn's budding romance and the interplay that captures these pleasantly goofy characters wonderfully.
 The Mummy stands out as my favorite action film of 1999-beating out the Phantom Menace and the Matrix by a fair margin. The other bit of good news, besides this gem of a movie, is that they are making a sequel, and one can only hope that it is every bit as good as the first. This is an excellent film and can easily take a place next to some of the best action films of all time-like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard, The Terminator, Big Trouble in Little China, and Aliens. It delivers at every turn-excitement, adventure, a few scares, and romance. Great fun and I highly recommend the letter boxed version over the pan-and-scan so that viewers can see everything.

The action was great and the special effects were  awesome. The cursing was non-existent which made it even more enjoyable.  There were very strong characters from the lead man (the strength of the  group) to the wimp of the group and the actors/actresses brought out each  characteristic strongly and they were very believable. The plot was  interesting because it wasn't your typical ""mummy chasing people""  movie. Where some movies focus on one storyline, this movie had a mixture  of action, romance and drama. The Mummy is definitely for someone who likes  good, clean entertainment.",955065600,,757,4.639097744360902

3189507,5,B00004D2X8,"Everyone has a complaint about this or that, but let's face it. They weren't out to recreate the original Mummy (with Karloff), but to put new faces into it. Brandon Frasier is great in this film with the right amount  of sarcasm that makes you laugh without getting on your nerves. The detail  put into the characters interaction is what helps makes this film  delightful. The special effects are good, but are definately outshined by  the acting. It's one of those movies you through on while you do something  else simply because you wouldn't mind hanging out with the characters if  they existed in real life. The humour is genuine and not forced, it has the  right amount of thrills. With the Indy series nearly dead (rumours abound  of a fourth, but only rumours), I wouldn't mind them taking Brandon  Frasiers character to fill his shoes. The era of the time, with all it's  mystic and prim and properness just lends well into the mysteries of the  unknown. Heck, Tommy Lee Jones went from the fugitive to US Marshalls, so  let them do it here. And all around great fun film. People's  disappointments with it stem from it possible being TOO much fun with out  being more seriousness. But nothing is forced and the humour level is  perfect. Not to mention the DVD itself is chockful of goodies like  commentaries, histories, mini-games, etc. Great attention to detail for DVD  extra's.",954633600,,1392,4.733333333333333
3189508,5,B00004D2X8,"I didn't care for the film when I first saw it in the theater, but I have to admit I was with friends who were vocally underwhelmed by it and in a multiplex cinema where sound from another film was very intrusive.  Since  seeing it on full screen, I have purchased the DVD and have to admit the  picture definitely grows on a person.  The ""ouch"" of the obvious  historical goofs (If the pyramids--which are on the Giza plateau near  Cairo--can be seen from Thebes about 500 miles south, it must have been one  hell of a clear day! ) gives way to the supreme satisfaction of searching  them all out!  There is an entire web site just dedicated to the Mummy's  historical inaccuracies, so one has to know some very bright people were as  entertained as I by this movie.  In fact if I were doing the sequel, I'd  probably include a few, letting it be well known, just to keep the history  buffs entertained.  My chief disappointment in the film is that the reason  for Imhotep's passion for Ankhesenamon is not really very clear.  I realize  she looks better than most of us with her clothing painted on her body, but  I rather doubt that beauty alone would be sufficient to account for the  priest's near obsession with the lady.  I couldn't help wondering what she  has that the rest of us don't, when Imhotep's only concern was to spend  eternity with her.  I suspect if she's just beautiful, the guy could be  designing his own peculiar brand of hell!  Actually, with what I know of  history and with the information I received from the film, I came up with  my own very satisfactory solution.  Perhaps Mr. Sommers will enlarge on the  history of the couple in the next film.  Mr. Frasier's hero was very  energetic and engaging.  One could hardly avoid comparing his efforts to  keep his own lady alive to Imhotep's plight.  In many ways the two  characters are much alike, which makes their ultimate contest that much  more poignant.  Ms Weis was delightfully dizzy, reminding me that to be  very bright is not necessarily to be very ""together.""  Mr  Vosloo's Imhotep is quite good.  Over and over I am amazed by the  gentleman's capacity to almost physically remake himself.  His ability to  imply history for his characters is notable, as is his ability to convey  meaning through body language and facial expression.  Probably one of the  best characters however, is Benny, O'Connell's erswhile ""friend.""  His capacity for self-preservation and self-advancement is delightful.  Perhaps he represents just a little bit of all of us when he runs for cover  in the face of adversity.  .",953942400,,2589,4.652561247216036

Imohtep, the high priest of Thebes, and the pharoh's mistress fall in love, and they are caught sleeping together. The mistress is sentenced to death, Imohtep is cursed  with the 10 plagues of Egypt, then buried alive with flesh-eating scarabs.  Some thousand years later, a lady called Evie goes on an expedition with a  group of people (including Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel), in search of  the lost city Thebes.

3189529,3,B00004D2X8,"A tricky one, this. Enjoyable, certainly. Stunning, definitely. Fulfilling? Not really.
Let's be positive. Brendan Fraser is a great young actor who deserves truckloads of applause for his work. He gives a  wry, sardonic, yet somehow enthusiastic perfomance - outstanding, given he  must have been prancing around in front of a blue screen half the time. The  scenery and special effects are enchanting, and are the kind of thing DVD  can improve immensely. It's a carefully timed and well-tailored story  that'll move smoothly over your senses.
And then the movie's over, and  you think: 'Oh.' Because in the cold light of day ""The Mummy""  just doesn't do enough. As per recipe, all the greasy and untrustworthy  characters are offed in satisfyingly unpleasant ways. Our rude and  uncultured hero gets the prim and proper heroine, who screams a bit and  runs around while he wields a sword. Everything just wraps up a bit too  neatly. And because the whole thing is played slightly-for-laughs, it's  hard to feel any real anxiety about the drama. You know the ending  already.
Definitely see this movie. It'll entertain, and you'll see some  good acting and some genuinely beautiful scenery. But try before you buy.  And don't expect Shakespeare, or even Dickens.",951004800,,1264,5.067961165048544

The special effects and humour  are great.  For me, John Hannah is excellent as the brother and has some of  the best lines - look out for the way he copes with the mass of people  under Imhotep's power as he runs for the car!

Naturaly, the directors  could not avoid the numerous misconceptions about the Black Land: the  mummy's name is Imhotep (who was the builder of Jhoser's pyramids, not a  vizier, pharaoh, or anything close), the mummy's powers are invoked through  a ""Black Book"" and a ""White Book"" (Egyptians didn't use  books in the modern sense of the word, moreover, they didn't use locks or  keys).

The acting is perfect for each part - particularly John  Hannah as a wimpy thief reluctantly tagging along to save the world. This  movie has everything; it's funny, it's entertaining, and can be watched  over and over again without losing any of its charm (trust me - I know).",947635200,,592,4.4953271028037385

Although movies tend to bend truths and take  liberties in regard to actual facts, this movie was surprisingly accurate.  The ancient egyptian diagogue spoken was even accurate, having been  researched by a scholar, and provided the first spoken version of it in  modern times.

But there's also a good deal of suspense (as  you would expect in a Mummy movie), and plenty of humourous one-liners as  well.

Pros:
*The movie is a visual masterpiece. The visual and sound FX are breath-taking.
*Heart-stopping action.
*Althouhg it's a sci-fi  movie,it actualy has a plot!
*Brendan Fraser was terrific. I never though  he could be so.
*Rachel Weisz was terrific too. Real eye candy.
*Very  beautiful desert settings.
*Fast and intense camera  movements.
*Excellent score.
*A super cool villain.
*Definitely the  hottest and coolest extras you will ever find. In fact,the extras are enough  reason to buy this DVD.
Cons:
*Although Stephen Sommers did a better  job than any other director in trying to authenticate the Arabs,they  weren't 100%.There were some Lebanese accents in Egypt,and a lot of the  language isn't clear enough.
*Some overacting in jokes,namely Rachel  Weisz's brother(in the movie).
*Arabs are either:degenerate scum(the  prison warden),low wiesels(that mummy's sidekick),killers and a lot of  other negativities.",944611200,,995,5.56

I think that DVD's should have the extra features because of the added cost over VHS-it gives the customer an incentive to  buy. I especially enjoyed the documentary on ILM who did the effects for  the film which are great.
On the down side, the plot line was quite  shallow and really lacking. After a while I felt that the effects had taken  center stage and the story was secondary. If you want a disc with good  audio and video to show your friends what the format is capable of, then  buy this. Otherwise get the Boris Karloff version.",944265600,,627,4.316239316239316

The positives are that the special effects, costumes and sets are all very good. However, the story starts out okay but soon enough fades into cliches and a chaotic swirl that seems to exist just so they can throw in corny humor and unneeded violence. The characters are terribly tiring and annoying, I kept hoping the story would improve and redeem this film, but it didn't. The constant dumb humor kept getting in the way any kind of eerie or exciting moods that might have been created. Universal should be ashamed, they had the money and the time and instead of putting out a modern horror classic they put a big stinker that that tries to combine Indiana Jones with Army of Darkness, but fails miserably.

The producers bet and won that people who loved the Indiana Jones movies  would flock to a reasonable facsimile.  The movie proved to be very  popular-and deservedly so.  Action, humor and suspense are woven  seamlessly.  The director resisted the temptation to overdo special  effects.  The casting was near perfect.  The result is a superior  actin/adventure movie, easily the best since Stephen Spielberg decided not  to do this stuff anymore.  Understand. The director is not nearly as good  as Spielberg in building tension. But to say that your director is not as  good as Spielberg is a little like complaining that an author doesn't  measure up to Homer. The real surprise of the movie is Brendan Fraser. The  man is the ideal action/adventure hero; and I wager that until this movie  was released, few suspected it. Looking back it's easy to see that he would  be: Tall. Distinct looks. Unique voice.  An easy charm. But before, well  who would have thought it. If Stephen Spielberg wishes to revive the Indian  Jones series, he should take the role from Harrison Ford (too mature for  the role now) and give it to Brendan Fraser. He's that good. The DVD  version is very good in the way DVD is.  Out-takes. background.  How the  movie was put together etc. But of course the real reaon to buy is the  clarity; and here the clarity is first rate. I would rate this movie  higher, but the fact that the main idea was taken from the Indian Jones  movies will stop it from becoming a classic.",943660800,,1643,4.75

Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in,  there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running,  guns firing, dust flying.  These action sequences are nothing more than  time fillers and BOREING to watch.  The humour in The Mummy was a total  distraction and offset the mood of the entire film.  It turned into this  hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.
The  romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing  here.

I thought it was a fantastic movie plus all of  the extra goodies on the DVD are a plus.  DVD is an exciting new format and  this movie is a great one to own on it.  I also highly recommend The  Matrix, Alien Legacy, and Nightmare on Elm St. box set.",939168000,,574,4.071428571428571

3189651,1,B00004D2X8,When I saw this movie I was so grateful that the producers didn't waste any money on screenwriters directors or actors...  they sunk every penny into special effects... isn't that what America wants?,939168000,,199,5.03030303030303
3189652,4,B00004D2X8,"This movie is proof that special FX alone do not a good movie make!  I missed this one in the theater, but I can honestly say I probably would have been as bored with it there as I was watching it at home.  The story  line is too predictable. And the only difference between this version and  the Boris Karloff version was the edition of 90's computer FX.  The FX were  spectacular, but the acting left a lot to be desired.  It was very hard to  get to like, or dislike any of these characters.  They seemed one  dimensional at best.  One laughable scene has the fierce Imhotep sitting in  a hotel room with one of his victims as if they are best buddies having a  beer.  Why does the all powerful priest feel the need to be social with his  victim before he finishes him off...give me a break! (He wasted no time  with any of his other victims.)  And at one point when he could have  finished off Brendan Fraiser's character he decides to let his hapless  zombies do the work.  Come on!  If you are looking for mindless escapism  then rent this movie. If you are looking for a truely ingenious, classic  movie with the right blend of special FX and quality acting, rent any of  the Indiana Jones movies!",938995200,,1204,4.2959641255605385
3189653,4,B00004D2X8,"I truly enjoyed this movie. If you are expecting a remake of the old horror film, don't. The original was great. This movie is full of adventure. Brendan Fraser plays an Indiana Jones type character. In my  opinion, the only movie where he was better was ""Gods and  Monsters"". The other cast members are very good also. As always, I  never know whether to hate or feel sorry for the ""monster"". I  don't think anyone would be disappointed in this movie. Kick back and  enjoy.",938995200,,474,4.529411764705882
3189654,2,B00004D2X8,"The MUMMY has great digital effects and stunning production values. However, great effects alone do not make a good movie. The script is tongue-in-cheek, often played for laughs. Therefore the element of surprise  and horror is often compromised. The chracters are often irritating. The  only exception is Arnold Vosloo as the title chracter who is is given litte  to do. Brendan Frazer as a gun totting, loud mouth hero who shoots at any  thing that moves (even a wind storm)is hammy. It is hard to believe this is  the same actor who turned in such a fine performance in GODS AND MONSTERS.  I will give Fraser the benifit of doubt and blame the script and direction.  The other chracters are just as predictable. The DVD, however will not  disappoint movie fans. Every detail involved in the making of THE MUMMY is  explored. A good commentary track, a 50 minute documentary on the digital  effects is better than the film. Jerry Goldsmith's music score (which I  enjoyed) is presented on its own over the language menu. Unfortunatly you  cannot skip ahead, back or pause the music track, otherwise it resumes from  the begining. Get the MUMMY DVD if you enjoy learning about movies are  made. But in my opinion, the movie alone is not worth repeating.",938908800,,1254,4.772093023255814

3189664,5,B00004D2X8,My husband and I love scary flicks and we are not easily impressed but this was an edge of your seat movie Beatifully filmed and costuming was excellent.  Branden Frazier has never done such a great job didn't know he  had the Indiana Jones in him. This was like wathching Indiana Jones with a  little more fear and other world experiences.  Good little bit of love  also. The special effects for this film were a major suprise and I think  some awards should be in order.  One of the best summer movies for '99  especially if you like horror.,937872000,,543,4.414141414141414
3189665,5,B00004D2X8,"This was one of the best movies of 1999.  It may have been a bit too formulaic for some reviewers but, guess what?  That's how Hollywood works  folks!  That's right!  The effects were very good and it was down right  funny as well.  Maybe it's just because I'm partial to monster movies.  Maybe it's because I don't try to look too deep into a 2 hour sitting of  scrolling pictures.  Maybe it's because, and maybe you'll agree with me  maybe you won't, it's just a freakin' movie folks!!  This is a must see if  you look at movies as a way to escape the every day hum and drum of life.  If you are looking for a movie that speaks to you, try something with  Shakespeare in the title and don't waste your time reviewing monster  movies.  If you think this movie is good also check out Deep Rising.",937094400,,796,4.23489932885906

I simply sat back and enjoyed it for what the movie was able to  give me, great special effects, a story with enough meat to at least keep  me intrested, fairly likable characters, and a whole lot of action and  running around.

Despite hard blows to it such as the Mummy has no plot or the characters are hard to identify with this movie has grossed over $300 million worldwide.
