Michael Rayner gets all his laughs by being a genuinely funny  person.  This is a video that I can watch with my grandmother and my five year old nieces, and everyone enjoys it!  The closest thing I can compare it to is watching a Buster Keaton film where the jokes are smart and silly all at the same time.  Another thing that struck me is how he interacts with his audience.  The stage is his playground and he really draws everyone in.  I can't help but think this would be a great show to see live.",1236211200,,653,4.209677419354839

8334902,5,B001PZ97QW,"This is one of our family's favorite dvd's, and we always bring it along on trips when kids of different ages might need to agree on watching one thing.  The humor appeals to kids and adults, and it's playful without ever being crude.  Wholesome entertainment that is truly entertaining!",1234915200,,287,4.836734693877551
