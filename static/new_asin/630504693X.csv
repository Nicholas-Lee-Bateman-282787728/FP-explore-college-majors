8430518,4,630504693X,"This is one of the very few videos available for James Hall. While the video was bit dark and not as slick as some of the new dvds coming out these days(2005). This concert manages to confirm my feeling that James Hall and Worship and Praise must be one of the best choirs around. The vocals are excellent and you can hear them clearly. The instruments are good. The choir movements or choreography is great.

While I would have wanted some more of the James Hall anthems on this DVD  (Like God is in Control, Caught Up,...) the fact there are very recordings of James Hall and Worship and Praise makes this video a required purchase for serious fans of this style of music.",1128297600,,674,4.42741935483871
8430519,5,630504693X,"This is one of the best Gospel videos I have ever seen. Many young people think that James Hall is to old-fasioned but I'm young too and my opinion is different. I no listening to the Cd may not get you to like James Hall but after you watched the video you will enjoy the cd even more. This video brings all the songs on the cd to life. Many older people think dancing is wrong when it comes Gospel, but I garantee the moves they did on the video were tasteful and I think the Lord would be pleased. My favorite songs on the video are, ""Jesus Lives"", and ,""God Wants A Yes."" Check it out.",1011225600,,589,4.042735042735043
