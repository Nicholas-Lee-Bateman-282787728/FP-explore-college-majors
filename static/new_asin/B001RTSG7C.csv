8338828,1,B001RTSG7C,"My DVD shows the same problem: part 4 (""An emotional reunion"") is lacking, and a DVD containing only 21 minutes is no good value. Pity, because the whole broadcast was really moving.",1260230400,5,182,4.71875
8338829,1,B001RTSG7C,"I ordered this DVD and played it with great hopes.  Well, it's advertised as 27 minutes in length (thinking it would be 100% of the broadcast which I did see) and the DVD quits playing at the 20 minute mark!
