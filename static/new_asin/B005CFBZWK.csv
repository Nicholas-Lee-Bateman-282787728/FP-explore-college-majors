4652996,5,B005CFBZWK,Vampires the way they should be no glitter! They follow the original vampire line instead of the gushy romantic tree hopping stuff,1353196800,,130,4.954545454545454
4652997,3,B005CFBZWK,"Dracula 2000:
A clever idea for the prince of darkness, but too many liberties were
taken with it...
 What I liked about it:
1. How Mr. Van Helsing cheated death to stay alive long enough
to find a way to kill Dracula!
2. How the crooks got Dracula's coffin out from a secure
location!
3. Gerard Butler played Dracula well!
4. The soundtrack (for the most part) rocked!
5. I love the lines: ""Sorry sport. I'm an atheist!""
""God loves you anyway!""
6. How it all took place in New Orlands during Mardi-Grau was
priceless!
7. I loved the scene when Dracula was watching the music video
and said ""Brilliant""!

What I didn't like was:
1. Dracula's looks made him look like a guy who is a former
rock star!
2. The movie felt like more than a B-movie and less than an A-movie
at the same time!
3. Not all the characters served a good purpose!
4. Why would Dracula be Judas? I though Jesus Christ forgave
Judas after his betrayal! And why would our lord and savior
create such a blood thirst killer for our world?!?!

Over-all; Dracula 2000 was not a bad movie, but it had so much potential to
be more than what it was... Although some of the elements in them movie were
good, in the end we want it to be more than it was...
My grade for this movie: C+ or two-and-a-half stars!

Dracula II: Ascension:
Dracula 2000 was a bit of a let-down for most fans of the prince of darkness,
but know our studios now a days, a sequel was inevitable for it...
What I liked about it:
1. Jason Scott Lee was a great vampire hunter!
2. The guy who played Dracula (I forget his name) was a little better
than Gerard Butler!  He was very evil with the character!
3. The B-movie actors chosen were, for the most part, good.
4. the entire concept for the movie was a nice twist for Dracula!
5. I like how they explain why Dracula keeps changing forms, from
actor to actor!

What I didn't like was:
1. Some of the characters were not that good!
2. They could have had better vampires!
3. It could have had more suspense in it.

Over-all: This movie was a slight improvement over Dracula 2000!
Keep in mind in the end that this is a direct to video (DVD/Blu-Ray)
movie, so don't expect too much out of it!
My grade for this movie: B- or three stars!

Dracula III: Legacy:

This movie was equally good with the last one!
What I liked about it:
1. Jason Scott Lee came back!
2. The guy who played Dracula looked and acted better
than the last two did!
3. The build-up in the movie was good!

What I didn't like was:
1. They could have used Dracula more than they did!
2. I didn't like the fact that Jason Scott Lee ended up being
the villain in the end!
3. The movie felt a bit under-whelming too many times!

Over-all: It was equally good with the series last movie!
My grade for this movie: B- or three stars!

Bottom-line: All three moves had a few major flaws, but used some good and
original concepts! All three are worth a look!
My grade for the series: C+ or two-and-a-half stars!",1343433600,6,2954,4.255357142857143
4652998,4,B005CFBZWK,"This DVD has three movies.(No. 1) was interesting, but without the horror.(Movie No. 2) started out puzzling, but toward the end was very exciting. Movie(No. 3) the spin-off from (No. 2) was exciting and with more action and chilling results leading to the nice twist at the end. I am very pleased with this DVD.",1333929600,,312,4.6909090909090905
4652999,3,B005CFBZWK,"If you have seen Dracula 2000 and didn't like it, don't bother with the sequels because like most series, they slide down hill. This DVD set is on a 2 sided disc. So if you are looking through the $5.00 bin, make sure it doesn't rattle. There are no extras, which would have been nice. In the first movie a high tech team decides to rob the secret treasure of a man named Van Helsing. The fact it is in a sealed coffin doesn't raise enough eyebrows. Eventually the vampire is let loose and is on its way to New Orleans to go after Van Helsing's daughter. In this episode we discover the biblical story of  the vampire's origin. Van Helsing has accumulated a wild assortment of weapons which he has no trouble bringing through customs.

The second film picks up in New Orleans and is only loosely connected to the first one. In this movie we have some interesting subjects that are new to the vampire screen. These include a vampire autopsy (white liver), grow lights used as an artificial sun (okay done before), and how to revive a vampire once destroyed by the sun.  I liked 3 lines from this film, ""I want to lick you and suck you dry."" Nothing like suggestive vampire eroticism. The second one was, ""There is a right way to do the wrong thing."" And the third line I used as my title. The film spends a lot of time with a chained up vampire and experiments being performed with his blood. In fact it dwells on the topic too long as even the geek in me got bored. Plot continuity point: If a bloody vampire is buried in the ground and they emerge, they should have dirt on them too and not just fresh looking blood.

The third film continues in Romanian with the two vampire hunters from the second film. Seems the locals are trafficking in blood (pretty centerfold looking women who end up nude and bloody in the castle...no realistic fat chicks).

F-bomb, sex, nudity (first and third film). You should be able to buy all 3 features separately (used) with deleted scenes and director's commentaries cheaper than this DVD at $5.00.",1326758400,10,2034,4.456989247311828
4653000,5,B005CFBZWK,"I've been looking for this movie since last Fall. This was it, shipping and price were great! I would recommend to anyone.",1398211200,,122,4.590909090909091
4653001,4,B005CFBZWK,These are a good dracula movies. I love horror movies.  Wes Craven puts out good horror movies. Good one to watch late at night.,1394064000,,128,4.333333333333333
4653002,4,B005CFBZWK,"I love Gerard Butler, so I watched this film on TV.  I was impressed with the story line--I won't go into detail, but the back story was fresh and original and gave a new slant on the origin of the Dracula character--it was very clever.  There are a lot of things wrong with Dracula 2000 (I haven't watched the other two movies included in the series yet), but it's still enjoyable to view.  Glad it was cheap and included extra movies--I hope they are worth the watching.",1388275200,,472,4.402298850574713
4653003,4,B005CFBZWK,for vampire lovers this is a should have collection. I was surprised that I had not seen two of these films,1381795200,,107,4.142857142857143
4653004,5,B005CFBZWK,"Wes Craven never disappoints and this trilogy is for anyone who loves Vampires. So turn out the lights, grab some popcorn, and watch with a friend.",1380931200,,147,4.6923076923076925
4653005,4,B005CFBZWK,"As some have pointed out, in this series of 3 interrelated movies, quality deteriorates as one moves from beginning to end. Nonetheless for those not overly attached to Vampire Movies, there is sufficient interest to watch the three segments over a period of time.  For we amateurs in the genre, there  is some confusion in each of them as to what is going on and why, but one can shrug those moments off. There are no subtitles so that those of us with hearing problems will carry a somewhat larger burden of misunderstanding. Not being of that persuasion, I have no idea of the reaction of a devoted follower.",1378425600,,611,4.5963302752293576
4653006,5,B005CFBZWK,"Dracula 2000

( Omar Epps, Jennifer Esposito, Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas aka Trick,  and Tony Munch ) play the foolhearty looking for treasure thieves who rob a mansion owned by Abraham Vanhelsing ( Christopher Plummer ) they find a sealed coffin thinking it full of valuable antiquities they take it with them. On board a private plane after numerous failed attempts to open it one of them accidently opens it and dracula ( Gerard Butler ) is set loose to roam the earth once again and all hell breaks loose, bloody mayhem ensues inside the plane. ( Johnny Lee Miller ) plays Vanhelsing's antiques dealer/warrior who has to track down and kill dracula. Later it is learned that Vanhelsing has been taking injections of dracula's blood which was passed on to his daughter during her conception resullting in giving her a direct connection to dracula who is looking for her.

There are some comical moments like when vampire hunter ( Johnny Lee miller ) shoots ( Omar Epps ) with a special bullet ""Jesus loves you,""

Omar's reply ""I am an athiest ,"" and Johhny lee tells him Jesus loves him anyway

Dracula III Legacy

Marshall arts master/actor ( Jason Scott Lee ) stars in Dracula III Legacy as a priest/vampire hunter who's not quite human himself, He hunts dracula tracking him all the way to another country. All three movies are action packed from start to finish, excellent plots, and spectacular special effects. So if you love vampires, good vs evil, and action served with a side order of bloody mayhem then these are the movies for you, I've seen all 3 and highly reccomend them",1372982400,4,1598,4.73021582733813
4653007,3,B005CFBZWK,"I bought it because I was searching for some movies to watch, and it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. It was not bad just somewhat cheesy sometimes.",1369699200,,162,3.9393939393939394
4653008,3,B005CFBZWK,The tracking was absent for about a week and it was farther than what the estimated arrival date was.  The only damage was the case but DVDs were unharmed.,1369353600,,155,4.344827586206897
4653009,5,B005CFBZWK,"I am so happy I was able to find these three movies together. I saw Dracula 2000 at the movies and love how the out of time Dracula character would fare in the 21st century.

I've watched Dracula 2: Ascension about ten times and never get tired of this great sequel.

Dracula 3: Legacy is another great sequel.

I also love how all three movies are on one disk.",1367798400,,361,4.202898550724638
4653010,5,B005CFBZWK,"This DVD offers Dracula 2000 with Gerard Butler which is one of the finest takes on the Dracula character.  Gerard Butler is a fantastic Dracula ladies.

The other two Dracula movies are good too.  Wes Craven movies for horror movie fans are top of the line.",1363132800,,258,4.565217391304348
4653011,3,B005CFBZWK,"It's a fun trilogy to watch. That's really about all I care to say about it. The last one (like most trilogies) got kind of idiotic, but it was still fun. Rutger Hauer at his best in B-movie fashion!",1362441600,,199,4.128205128205129
4653012,5,B005CFBZWK,"If you like vampire movies you'll love these. Each one gets beter than the last. Gerard Butler in the 1st one is gorgeous,he doesn't say much,but his actions are right on. The other 2 are great also.",1362268800,,199,4.405405405405405

4653015,4,B005CFBZWK,"This was a good movie that was not scary but a thriller that will keep you interested to the end.  Some things are alittle much like Dracula is really Judas from the Bible.  This doesn't make sense, why would God set such evil on mankind.  I still say buy it.",1357689600,,259,4.14
4653016,3,B005CFBZWK,I really only brought this movie set for the first movie but the other were ok and for the price you can't go to wrong. The other two movie are a bit cheesy and even funny in some places. It is a good buy for three movies that are a bit cheesy.,1356480000,,244,3.7115384615384617

4653019,3,B005CFBZWK,"The 1ST FILM, DRACULA 2000, was awfully boring and not scary.
Film #2 ""Ascension"" was almost as bad as #1.
After viewing these 2 films I wanted to throw this DVD in the scrap heap.
However, Film #3 Legacy was EXCELLENT.
It took place in Rumania/Transylvania with the back drop of a modern day revolution going on. It had all of the elements of a classic vampire film with a setting in Eastern Europe. The vampires in the film were extremely scary and realistic according to legend. The ending was good as well.
If one is planning on inviting a bunch of friends to watch a classic vampire/horror film, I recommend just watching ""Dracula 3: Legacy"".",1353628800,,647,4.586206896551724
