5647658,5,B00BMQODF4,"This is one intense flick.

Been a long time coming and worth the wait...

Production, direction, screenplay, it's all there.

Sit back and enjoy !",1368576000,2,147,4.8
5647659,5,B00BMQODF4,"If you are a zombie fan, this is a must have for your collection !! This movie is like no other zombie flick out there...my wife and I watched this after the kids went to bed...she had to cover her eyes through half of it !!",1368403200,10,224,3.891304347826087
5647661,5,B00BMQODF4,"This isn't really a zombie movie but a movie about people infected with an extraterrestrial germ. Of course it makes them insanely violent and cannibalistic, but it's not like Romero movies with reanimated dead.
Like I said in the title it's a 'B"" movie with about a half million $ budget so don't expect The Avengers quality, but it's the best ""B"" zombie movie I've seen in a long time. The acting is decent throughout. The unbelievable plot is made to be believable. The heroes are the imperfect heroes we tend to love, but heroic nevertheless. And most of all it's just flat out good for a cheap movie.
 I hate writing movie reviews because there are so many of you that are a whole lot better at it but I felt compelled to comment on this one. It's not on Amazon. It's not on Netflix. I had to watch it on Free HULU and watch all those commercials about things you wouldn't buy if someone was holding a gun to your head. But it was great! (for a ""B"" movie).
Come on Amazon. Put this little gem on Prime so alot of your customers can enjoy a really good, offbeat surprise.",1381017600,4,1075,4.321782178217822
5647662,3,B00BMQODF4,"I love a good zombie movie.  Unfortunately, this isn't one.  I'm not even certain it's supposed to be a zombie movie.  The ""infected"" are described as just cannibals on the DVD case.  Even so, this is a peculiar effort at best.  The camerawork is shoddy.  The acting is primitive.  The production values are basic.  The blood and gore looks as if it was indiscriminately applied by the bucketful, generous but overdone.  Worst of all was the story and the dialog.  Too much time was wasted on disconnected, choppy snippets used to introduce the cast, brief scenes that revealed nothing more than a headcount (a person squeezing oranges, a few seconds of someone in a lake or river, people heading for a forest).  To complicate matters further, the introduction is quickly made null and void with an inscription across the screen: 40 hours earlier..............  The army is moping around a forest, supposedly dodging a fire (in name only), while looking for a...............fill in the blank, too many possibilities are mentioned.  Also in this same forest a few firemen are strolling around, a troop of girl scouts are camping, a guy is chopping firewood.  It takes forever before something finally happens and then when ""it"" does, it's done off screen, shown later as a just body that was chewed on by several people.  When the attacks finally-finally take place on screen, it's a disjointed and furious mess, happening to characters with no dimension, no personality, they're just bodies at this point, spare parts, little more than special effects.  Hardly worth the long wait.
Also, the cover art on the DVD bears no resemblance whatsoever to the movie it's supposedly depicts.",1380672000,,1682,4.996402877697841
5647663,4,B00BMQODF4,"When a meteor knocks a satellite to earth near a small town, both military and local residents are infected with a mysterious germ that turns them into extremely aggressive cannibals. To survive, however, the uninfected must evade the infection & the cannibals and find a way to stop the germ from spreading before it is too late.

To be completely honest, I was really skeptical about this film at first. Viewing the trailer, I figured it was going to be real stinker. Yet, when I saw it on the shelf to purchase, I read the description of it & thought that maybe it might not be too bad as it was, in description anyhow, essentially a zombie film. Course, when I viewed the film, I soon realized that they weren't zombies in the classical sense nor the World War Z sense either. That didn't matter, though, because it was too late as I'd already purchased the thing and had it in my DVD player. Giving it a look, I was pleasantly surprised. Germ Z wasn't as bad as I'd thought it would be. It was an interesting film, despite its' low-budget. I was entertained.

My only gripes with the film was in its' pacing and the fact that, at times, Germ Z was all over the place plot-wise. If both of those things were tightened up a bit, Germ Z would've been perfect. As it stands, though, it was okay but I liked it!!",1377561600,5,1312,4.372950819672131
5647664,3,B00BMQODF4,"I was a little skeptical at first, based off of the reviews. The movie wasn't great and the acting wasn't excellent, but it did hold attention pretty well. there were a few inadequacies that i don't want to point out and the character decisions were flawed at times. The gore was done well, the storyline was there and the ending wasn't awful. all in all, i'd watch again if it was on TV, but it isn't worth the effort to put the DVD in again. laziness always trumps a 3 star product.",1376870400,,484,4.271739130434782
5647665,3,B00BMQODF4,"For a low budget zombie movie, I would have to say this a nice surprise.  Yes, it's slow as the start as they develop the characters.  This initially made me think ""Come On, Come On, Get started"".  But at the end of the movie I liked it.  What they did tied all the characters together.  I think the actors gave this movie a good shot, the deputy was my favourite.  I couldn't help thinking image what they could have done with a bit more money.",1376524800,,445,4.176470588235294
5647666,4,B00BMQODF4,"I found little about this film to be original, but it was entertaining. In fact, there were several moments when i thought it did a really good job of portraying how average people would react when zombies marched into their front yard. That includes a lot of confusion, disbelief and running from room to room...until there are no more rooms to hide in. I also liked how survivors would often hear screams and gun fire in the woods, but never actually see what was going on. Wish the ending had been a little less down beat, though. I liked the deputy.",1375488000,8,553,4.485148514851486
5647667,3,B00BMQODF4,"Pretty good sorta-zombie movie about a satellite that crashes in a small town, spreading a disease that makes people violent and hungry.  The space contagion causes the hypothalamus gland to keep expanding, which initially causes uncontrollable hunger and aggression but eventually causes the infected person's head to pop, so the infected have a limited amount of time to spread the disease before they drop dead themselves.  From a purist point of view these aren't zombies but sick people but the end result is pretty much the same.  Germ Z has exceptionally likable characters and is well-acted and paced.  It isn't really scary but it's enjoyable enough to watch once.",1372636800,2,673,5.146788990825688
5647668,2,B00BMQODF4,"This is ""Andromeda Strain"" plus zombies. There are a limited number of characters in this film that involves a small mountain community. I managed to like one of the characters, the deputy with a sense of humor. The rest of the characters lacked depth and dialog. The film moves slow for the first half and I was fairly bored up until that last 20 minutes. The plot while simple was haphazard. There is plenty of blood splatter.

Not Fangoria's best film, a disappointment.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. No nudity.",1371081600,7,519,4.7555555555555555
5647669,5,B00BMQODF4,"Germ may have been a low budget film, but Michael Flores gives a first class performance, best new talent of 2013.  Germ Z is not your typical run-of-the-mill zombie film.  First off, there are no zombies, only blood thirsty, crazed individuals infected by a germ from outer space that drives them to act like zombies.
This is a great film to add to your horror collection, and one you should not miss.",1369353600,2,402,4.569444444444445
5647670,5,B00BMQODF4,"Great, low budget Zombie(esgue) flick. I can see this one gathering a cult following. Hope they do a sequel, I think Michael Flores is definitely going places. I wouldn't be surprised to see him in some kind of Blockbuster on the big screen sometime soon.",1368662400,3,255,4.688888888888889

8570899,3,B00BMQODF4,"Ok, I love B movies. Watched tons of them and I generally am a truly easy to please watcher. However I am disappointed in Germ Z. They NEED to work on their camera control and their sound. This is not Blair Witch; hold the dang camera steady! The sound is atrocious. It's like they're using old 60s sound systems that don't work. Let's face it, the old Godzilla movies had clearer sound and steady camera work...even if the sound came after the lips moved but that's part of the old Godzilla movie charm. :) see, I'm pretty easy to please.
Ok, the story was ok, the characters were fair. It would have actually been a pretty good movie if this didn't come off as a college students final. The shoddy camera work really impacted it but the poor sound quality just killed the movie.
I still gave it 3 stars because other than the bumpy camera work and distant sounding sound, this was not really bad. I've seen FAR worse.",1402358400,,919,4.411764705882353
8570900,1,B00BMQODF4,"Let's just say a 4 year old can do better acting than all the people in this movie. I would literally rather spend 48 hours straight watching spongebob if I had the choice between the 2. I watched it on netflix, but I needed to worn any future buyers that this is the worst movie you can ever watch.",1399075200,,299,4.084745762711864
8570901,4,B00BMQODF4,"You've seen it all before if you are a Sci/Fi-Horror buff:  A satellite containing an alien virus enters the Earths atmosphere and crashes in a remote town infecting the populace and turning them into cannibals.  However, Writer/ Director J.T. Boone keeps things moving at a rapid pace boosting realistic performances by virtually unknown thespians.  It seems Fangoria magazine was behind this due to the budget being  slightly better than the amateur productions flooding the market these days.  The rapid fire editing by Randy Paik and spot on- in your face photography by Gus Sacks makes this an above average plague movie with occasionally grisly twists and turns.  Recommended for Zombie fans and wanna be future filmmakers.",1398470400,,729,5.241379310344827
