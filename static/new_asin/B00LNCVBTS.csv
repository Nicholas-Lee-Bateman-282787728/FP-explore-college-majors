8666863,5,B00LNCVBTS,"I enjoyed ""Tamako Market"" so much that I shelled out the money to have the sequel movie ""Tamako Love Story"" imported just so that I could say I own the movie with the pretty box it comes in. The only thing the original series lacked was a sort of romantic resolution and let me tell you this enchanting little slice of life movie delivers just that. If you enjoyed the series then I'm sure this final story with Tamako and her friends will suit you just fine, but I suggest waiting until an American company licenses it so that it can be watched on an American DVD player.",1414972800,4,572,4.305555555555555
