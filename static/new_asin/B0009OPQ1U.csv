What this disc does present, and effectively so, is performance - Hanp's incredible skill, showmanship, and passion for music are front and center.  Performances range between 1936 and 1993, and tend to emphasize the uptempo side of Hamp's music.  Video and audio quality is generally decent; there appears to have been some effort made to re-master both and present the material as well as reasonably possible.  The 1949-1950 era material, some of which is also presented on the ""Swinging At His Best"" DVD, looks and sounds better on this DVD.  The 1936 and 1939 clips with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman are quite sharp in sound and video. This makes the comparitively poor video condition of some of the 1950s and 1960s clips surprising, but I'd have to conclude that the producers did what was reasonably possible with the source material.

At any rate, as hard as it is to pick favorites from this consistently strong collection, some of those 1950s/60s clips are right up there. Seeing the 1958 clips of a 50 year Hamp mixing it up with Gene Krupa is just amazing - no way those clips could have been left out even if the video is fuzzier and grainer that it should be.

In no way an I any sort of jazz/swing guru, but I sure did enjoy watching this - this DVD is definitely a keeper.  Although its a bit short and maybe a bit pricey compared to other music DVDs, I would recommend it as a first purchase of Lionel Hampton music - either CD or DVD.  Its also a good introduction to the swing/jazz/big band genre for the non afficionado - it features some of the other greats along with Hamp and its uptempo feel translates well to modern sensibilities (or if you prefer, us rock heads with short attention spans!).",1122422400,9,1989,4.611898016997167
