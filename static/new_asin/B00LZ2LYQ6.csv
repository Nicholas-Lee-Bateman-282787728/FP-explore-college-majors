6516817,5,B00LZ2LYQ6,"I offered the following review over on IMDB for this movie and would like to share it here on Amazon. I bought the DVD directly from Big Biting Pig Productions but I know how valuable Amazon reviews can be for folks thinking about making a purchase.
---
Steve Hudgins has re-imagined the Classic Vampire movie genre in his groundbreaking tale ""The Caretakers."" This movie takes you into the world of those who know Vampires best: the people whose job it is to care for them. This is a beautifully engineered story of Vampire culture far removed from the usual ""The Young and the Restless (with fangs.)"" The Caretakers shatters many myths and commonly held beliefs about Vampires and how they operate with such authority that it will have you questioning the validity of every Vampire story to which you have ever been subjected.

Bill Johnson and Joe Estevez certainly lend an air of gravitas to this picture but Nick Faust and Michael Coon deliver world class performances each in their own right. Brittney Saylor brings the horror as the likable monster. April LaRae is compelling as the original-line Vampire. Jessica Dockery, Lucy Turner, PJ Woodside, Steve Hudgins and all the rest of the cast deliver their believable characters with flawless portrayals; which is fast becoming a hallmark of Big Biting Pig Productions fare.

As fans of this companies movies might expect, this one offers plot twists and turns and has no trouble holding your attention to the bitter end. If Big Biting Pig Productions movies keep getting better with each release then you have to say that this is their best yet.

6516838,3,B00LZ2LYQ6,"Once again, before you watch this movie, keep your volume controller handy, it's so bad, the volume shifts the entire movie, from being hard to hear to being way too loud (i have an excellent speaker system, and it works amazing on most movies except for ones with terrible sound editing).

Anyways it's a newer take on vampires, which is refreshing, the acting isn't terrible, the script is eh. A family is missing their daughter, and they hire some people to go looking for her, they think she has fallen into a group of vampires. So Catherine is a pure blood vampire, who is insanely powerful or something, and has people wanting to be her caretaker, meaning they bring bodies to her and she drinks their blood. Meanwhile, this guy is helping his friend Rachel, who he has been in love with since highschool, get blood, but it's specific blood it has to be of a certain blood type. So that happens, meanwhile Catherine needs a new caretaker since she is worried about hers, whose name is Jack (Nick Faust), he is one of the more enjoyable actors, until you give him a terribly long monologue. Also, i don't know why they made a vampire and called her ""The albino"" the make up and wig are distracting and terrible, which sounds rude, but it takes away from the movie a lot. It's not the best movie, but it's one of the more enjoyable movies from this company, which is saying something. It's a waste of the two actors they kickstarted to get into this film, the entire time they just sit around in a room on couches talking about how they have the experts looking for his daughter, and that entire subplot is one of the worst. Besides the hysterical guy who is obsessed with Rachel, the girl who became a vampire, yeah, the writing and directing of his character was so bad... it was overdone.",1458432000,3,1795,4.506134969325154

6516846,4,B00LZ2LYQ6,"I enjoyed this flick. Most vampire movies are pretty lame and rehashes of the same old formula. The story was interesting and kept my attention. Wish it was a bit more fast paced, but for a low-budget film, I won't complain.

I stumbled on Big Biting Pig films by chance and I'm glad I did. Always a fun watch. Just don't go in expecting a big-budget production.",1450742400,2,362,4.402985074626866

It's a cool thing that a small entrepreneurial independent movie company ""Big Biting Pig"" productions can make pretty good films on a budget  Now, they may not be the fancy big studio style films most folks are used to but you have to give them credit for the effort of producing some fun films. The acting is actually pretty good.  The cinematography is good and the writing is creative. I enjoy seeing the same actors in different characters in the other films also produced from this company.  This film and others from this studio won't appeal to eveyone and they may be an acquired taste but, hey, these movies may someday become cult favorites, if they aren't already.",1450483200,2,782,4.644927536231884

I wanted to turn it off after about a half an hour, but I waited and it started getting my interest. Yes, it's low budget, but so what, does everything have to be a blockbuster. Plus things and people in this movie look like actual people and things, not some director's idealized version of reality.

The acting was totally uninspired; I believe the Hollywood term is ""phoning it in."" This could have been a great movie, or at least a decent one, as it was, I've seen better acting in High School plays and College actors who were Tony winners by comparison.

6516864,3,B00LZ2LYQ6,"This movie had such promise, but honestly, I was tempted to turn it off several times during the run. There are some nice takes on the vampire mythology, and some very good ideas that, unfortunately, never get fleshed out. The main vampire character is sorely underused and unexplained, which weakens the entire premise the film builds on. Not using any special effects of note (some poor tries, some successes) did not hurt the story - but grounded it a bit. The movie is very well cast and well done for the script as it is, for the major roles. You were allowed to build a bit of empathy for the characters - the only thing that kept me watching at times. The background people and secondary roles, not so clear, not so memorable or important. The final vampire confrontation was a disappointment, and the trite ending very predictable. There are more than a few loose ends and not well-connected ideas, but overall an ok film that tried and had a lot of promise.",1437868800,,966,4.589595375722543

I like how they changed the story up about how vampires have to have a matching blood type in order to survive, never heard the story put that way before. The acting was good especially the strangling scene. It looked so real. The vampire was also cast perfectly. I get a kick at how PJ Woodside uses the same actors in most of her movies.

I have seen indi films and college films. Some of them are good despite amateur acting and low budgets. This is NOT one of those movies. Some of the older actors did well enough - though slightly phoned in. But the majority of the cast were terrible. I've seen more committed acting in middle-school plays. Even the (relatively speaking) ""good"" performances were as wooden and nuanced as a 2X4.

And the writing and plot were preposterous. Characters exist and come together for no reason. Vampire hunters show up when nothing happened to warrant vampire hunters showing up. Back stories of meaningless characters were played out while important characters got no screen time.

Oh. And it was SLLOOOOOOOWWWW.

Unlike most, this was a pretty good effort to make a movie with no budget and actors of borderline skill.  It's obvious these guys worked very hard on this and gave it their best shot.  It's also obvious they have little experience and most of them can't quite pull off their roles.  The acting is not bad....just inexperienced.

Where this movie fails is in the writing.  It's an interesting idea....exploring the role and motivation of the caretakers.  Unfortunately, it fails at that.  You are left constantly questioning if anyone would do that.  Especially the main caretaker.  There is a strong bond between him and the vampire and he is very knowledgeable yet the reasons for it are not very compelling.  And the amount the vampire cares about him is not explained, especially since it is made clear she isn't human and more than a little opportunistic when it comes to recruiting people.

The story wanders is the main problem.  There are various interesting characters they could have developed and choose not to....particularly the vampire hunters.  They could have chosen any one of these and made a great plot.....instead, they just sort of theft a ton of loose threads behind.",1434326400,2,1287,5.004716981132075

I love that the BBP (Big Biting Pig) movies are filmed in my town because I always like to see the locations of where they filmed. This newest film is a vampire flick mostly from the perspective from the Caretaker, the one who looks after the vampire. (Think of Renfield from Dracula or Willie Loomis from Dark Shadows) This movie has great cinematography with lighting and looks to take place around Fall, my favorite season. I also have 2 cameos in the film. If that doesn't hook you, then it also features Bill Johnson, who played Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 with Dennis Hopper, and it has Joe Estevez. An aging vampire caretaker named Jack is looking to train some new apprentices. Meanwhile, a dad is looking for his daughter, who is now a vampire and being looked after by Jimmy.

6516908,2,B00LZ2LYQ6,"Amazon really needs an algorithm to start examining reviews and looking for sock puppets, because wow, how many of these movies have ridiculously high ratings in the first few days after posting, only to plummet once real people actually start watching them?  I'm betting this one will drop to an average of 2 within a week.... Assuming those who get suckered into watching it bother reviewing.

This is an amateur production with stilted, overly expository writing, so-so camera work (although not the worst I've seen!), and a fumbling at addressing religion that's akin to a teen trying to remove their first bra.  The intensity of the acting and the overall quality is extremely variable. It's like not all the actors are receiving the same direction, or some disagreed on the overall approach... Is it serious? A comedy?  A parody?  It's not horror: there are no real scares, no tension, no coming face to face with the unthinkable, nary a chill to be found.

The sound wasn't bad, although how hard is it to do horror effects?  Minor chord, bass notes, cue the goosebumps.  It's at least subtle enough not to grate on the ears or overwhelm the dialogue.  Similarly, the effects are kept minimal, which prevented the viewer from being overwhelmed with hokey.

All of these are expected issues with an amateur production.  Elements of the writing, however, really prove problematic.  There are these constant missteps in logic that leave a viewer wondering how on earth these creatures have survived?  From one couple's somehow unnoticed door to door murder spree to the casual murders by the PI type (""hey, the boyfriend I should know about while investigating this girl's disappearance is clearly warning her of danger and probably trying to protect her, but I should shoot him and then expect her to trust me, a random stranger with a gun who just murdered someone, because THAT makes sense!) to the advice about knife fighting which takes a fish to focus on face, throat, and crotch, as if face and crotch wounds were as lethal as, say, femoral or brachial arteries.  But no, sure, whatever, waste your time jabbing wildly at someone who will likely manage plenty of screaming, flailing, and running. That will definitely help you keep the lid on your murderous operation.

There are lots of loose ends and unexplained coincidences.  Who is the girl with the white eyes (yes, we get that you bought white contacts and are very proud, but the eyes constantly bulging to show them off just emphasizes the fake)?  How does our pureline vampire happen to stumble on this family she rescues? How many murders will this town have before people begin to think relocating would be a good idea?  Why, at the end, with a pretty massive body count, do they act as if the dad of our knockoff vamp had some sort of leverage? Why not just kill him and try to get some control over the massive cluster.. Err.. bomb that is their attempt at existing secretly?

This movie gets to two stars by not being the worst of what Amazon has to offer.  The bar is very, very low.  But, unless you really enjoy B-grade amateur productions, it's not worth the time.",1433548800,3,3144,4.763837638376383
6516909,5,B00LZ2LYQ6,"This really surprised me. And I mean that in a good way.

6516911,4,B00LZ2LYQ6,"I'm rapidly becoming an admirer of Big Biting Pig Productions. They're a tiny group of indie filmmakers with budgets so small that they make Ed Wood's films look like Hollywood blockbusters in comparison. However, what this group has that poor Wood never had is a vision of what good filmmaking can be, and they are striving to make it a reality.

They are not 100% successful in achieving this vision, but they come close enough that, given the raw materials with which they have to work, I find their achievements nothing short of impressive.

Take this film, for example. Why, in all the years and years and years of vampire movies, has no one ever thought to make a film about the humans who care for the vampires? You know, the poor Renfields who slave away to protect the vampire, the serve the vampire, and to acquire food for the vampire? What could possibly drive such a person to serve such a being?

This film endeavors to explore that question, and with a surprisingly charismatic everyman lead such as Nick Faust, the result is surprisingly affecting. Frost plays Jack, one of the eponymous caretakers, an aging loyal servant to an ageless vampire, whom he has served since he was a young child. Jack is---to use a terrible pun---getting a little long in the tooth. He's not as fast or resilient as he once was, and his vampire mistress decides it's time he brings on some apprentices ... just as Jack himself was apprenticed decades earlier.

It's an interesting moment. To this particular vampire, her human caretakers are not her equals, true, but they aren't just disposable objects, either. They occupy an usual place in her unlife, perhaps that of a loyal and beloved pet. The only time Jack had seen his mistress cry, he relates in a tender moment, is when his predecessor died.

The choice of an aging Renfield leads to some surprising visuals, such as when he snuggles up to his mistress like a lap dog and she pleasantly indulges him. It's especially effective when you consider that here is an actor in his fifties (I think) in a scene with an actress in her twenties pretending to be a vampire in her hundreds. It reminds me of the line from ""What We Do in the Shadows"": ""Some people freak out about the age difference. They say whats this 96-year-old lady doing with a guy four times her age? They can call me cradle snatcher. Who cares? I decided to bite her and now were gonna be together forever.

There are actually TWO vampires in this movie, though not all vampires are created equal. Jack's mistress is a pure blood vampire, who is created like you or I. You know, the vampire birds and the vampire bees?

The second vampire is more like a Vampire Lite. She was an intended victim rescued at the last minute, but not before she had been bitten. In an explanation that scientifically is a bit of a stretch, but from a story point of view is pretty interesting, when a vampire feeds she introduces an agent into her victim's blood to make it more digestible. This agent, when not stopped, eventually turns the victim into a vampire of the more mindless variety.

Alas, her human protector, lover, and rescuer doesn't know that. One thing Big Biting Pig Productions is especially good at is dramatic irony: the method through which tension builds because the audience knows something that the characters in the story do not. In this case, WE know that this poor girl is on a one-way trip to psychoville, but neither she nor her boyfriend realize this. They think she's going to become like the vampire who bit her. This is a tragic mistake. She's a ticking vampire time bomb.

Now I mentioned that the film is not 100% successful, and so full disclosure is in order. This is an incredibly low-budget film. The actors are closer to the more successful graduates of a community theater than to the graduates of the Royal Shakespeare Company. They're talented, but without the bazillions of dollars Hollywood can toss at acting coaches, personal trainers, dialect coaches, fight coordinators, and so on, these actors must go it alone. Likewise, without $30k pieces of software like the Massive engine used to render the battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings series, and without A-list makeup artists, etc., the filmmakers have to make do with what they can lay their hands upon.

This forces them to be scrappy, however, and surprisingly often, produces unexpectedly good results. There are many scenes made more poignant BECAUSE these aren't the model-perfect actors with their plastic smiles. These actors come across as real people in real situations. It's a good thing.

There are some other hitches here and there. The flashback scenes are not so easy to do without all the special gear high-end filmmakers have at their disposal, and some of the dialogue is a bit clunky. One character makes quite a logical leap, jumping from assuming a girl has been kidnapped to assuming she's been turned into a vampire, all because of a single sentence left on a voicemail: ""They're changing me."" (or something like that)  Most people wouldn't make that logical leap; those that would probably should be on a lot of medication.

Still, all in all, this was a surprisingly good film. It's the second of their films I've put on, thought I was going to give up on during the opening scenes, and surprised myself by watching through to the very end.

If you set your expectations correctly, you too may be pleasantly surprised. I'll be following Big Biting Pig Productions in the future. I think of them like a growth stock: this is your chance to buy while the price is low, because there's a good chance it's going to skyrocket.",1433462400,12,5648,4.709219858156028

It's dark and humorless and with the exception of an albino girl that is astute at tracking vampires, there isn't a single character in the film to like.  It's a very low budget, amateurish production although the acting is decent.  The plot is very simple.  A powerful master vampire has suppliers ship her victims, which she keeps on hand in the cellar.  Victims are destroyed when she's done with them, but one has escaped and is the subject of a search by her father, who hires two professionals to find her.  The girl is a vicious hybrid that becomes more and more savage with the passing of time.  The pace is slow, but the film does improve in the second half.  The film makes it's own rules in comparison to more traditional vampire films, but that doesn't constitute an improvement, or welcome diversion.  The script, plot, and direction miss the mark.
