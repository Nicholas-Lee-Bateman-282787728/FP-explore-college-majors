Anyone could have done a better job using a 1980's video camera! Seriously, Risa is not teaching pure beginner Pilates, but a generic version that goes from pre-beginner to somewhat more advanced. I bought this DVD based on the five-star reviews, and am now extremely disappointed. It would have been nice to have been able to read a truthful review here on Amazon so I wouldn't have wasted my money.",1454457600,,549,4.612244897959184
8394615,5,B003D1A3OG,"As I began my search for a workout I could do at home, I was overwhelmed with all the DVD's out  there. I came across The Sheppard Method Pilates DVD. I cannot say enough about this video. There are so many videos out there..but something is different about the Sheppard Method. Where other videos have music that is distracting, the Sheppard Method DVD is tranquil and engaging.
You feel like Risa,the instructor,is right there in your living room with you!
There are two 30 min workouts,one for beginners,and one more advanced that you can work up to.
All in all,I am THRILLED I found this DVD!!!",1277856000,2,598,4.6415094339622645
8394616,5,B003D1A3OG,"Risa Sheppard's Method of Pilates is by far the best interpretation of Joseph Pilates' system. This DVD is simple, easy to follow and gives me the best results  with minimum stress--and no pain! For those who hate stressful gymnastics and other not-so-gentle forms of exercize, this DVD is for you.",1271548800,2,298,4.96
