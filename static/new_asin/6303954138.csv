737206,5,6303954138,One of my all time favorite movies. Growing up all I wanted to work at Empire Records. If you haven't seen it and you enjoy 90's films its a must see.,1500940800,,150,3.870967741935484

737210,5,6303954138,"This is my favorite movie of all the 90s.  Teen movies don't really get any better than this... for me, anyway.  Watching it kind of makes me want to have my own record store, as long as I'm rich and don't care if it's feasible in today's economy.  The characters are charismatic, and Anthony LaPaglia's character Joe is a cool boss to have and also doesn't take much crap.  I wish I had a cool job to go to like these kids.",1498176000,,424,4.134146341463414
737211,5,6303954138,One of my favorite 90's movies,1497916800,,30,4.166666666666667
737212,5,6303954138,"A great coming-of-age ensemble piece and probably a cult favorite for Generation X.  Featuring Anthony LaPaglia, Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger and Robin Tunney.  The soundtrack is phenomenal - in particular, Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like You"" is an earworm I don't want to get rid of.",1497484800,,279,5.043478260869565

737247,5,6303954138,"I see a lot of people disappointed at not getting the product they wanted. I agree with this point. Why not release an ultimate edition with both versions? I would pay for both in one package. I prefer the Remix edition because it is what introduced me to Empire Records. I also do like the original version, but very much miss the extra 16 or so minutes of the Remix edition. Maybe one day we will get both in one package. Here's hoping. I do the Remix DVD as well as the recent Blu ray release. They should come out with a Rex Manning Edition that includes both versions in one package. As I mentioned previously, here's hoping.",1494028800,,630,4.3474576271186445

Description doesn't say that its some kind of directors cut or whatever. I know this isn't high art or anything, but I was expecting to get the version of the movie that I've seen a hundred times. Amazon should definitely update the description and title. I feel completely ripped off. I can't watch this version of this movie!!!",1492128000,2,446,4.518518518518518

737251,2,6303954138,There should be some sort of warning on this. Empire Records is a fabulous movie!

This is some recut crap of a good movie. I waited for some of my favorite lines only to have them neutered or removed entirely.

737478,2,6303954138,I didn't like this film because I felt the characters were a little over the top in the way they were acting which is typical in a lot of movies.  I didn't think the story line was one that held my interest much but I did used to work in a record store and I was always curious about seeing this movie so about 21 years after it was made I finally got around to it.  I wouldn't say not to see it if you're curious but it doesn't stand out as a favorite for me.,1469491200,,460,3.78125

I became less and less thrilled as, while watching, I noticed more and more scenes missing from the movie. Like when Corey's sister runs in to give her the Harvard acceptance letter? Or the entire scene in Joe's office that leads up to Jane quitting? The lead up to Deb taking care of Corey after her meltdown? Not to mention the changing of several lines in the movie.

I started watching and from the beginning I noticed that there was an added scene.  This was fine because I figured I would be getting a directors cut of the movie so there would be added scenes.  As the movie progressed I noticed that there other scenes that were added and things that were not there that I was expecting to be there.  It was an overall disappointment and since it is digital I am unable to return.  There needs to be some sort of clue up there that lets one know that this is not the original version of the movie.  I am all for having extended scenes but not without sacrificing the integrity of the original movie.

I'm well aware that it is not a particularly good movie and that there are many things wrong with it, but it reminds me of my childhood (I was 11 when it came out) and I loved it back then so I love it now because it brings me back to a simpler, more innocent time. That being said, this version of the movie is bloody awful. They changed soooo many things. Different music, omitted lines, omitted scenes, added scenes (which are all awful and take away from the charm of the movie btw...they were best left on the cutting room floor...). It gives the movie a totally different vibe, which for fans of the movie is like blasphemy. Not to mention taking out lines and scenes and music that are a huge part of what fans love about the movie......???? Travesty. Total travesty. The bigger travesty though is that there is little warning of this. The description does mention that there's 16 minutes of added footage but it does not mention all the other changes/omissions NOR does it clearly explain that this extra footage is plopped right into the movie (as opposed to being available in the special features) or that there's no option to watch the original theatrical version of the film...the version that FANS know and love...and since this DVD claims to be a special ""fan edition"" its upsetting that they seem to have completely forgotten about the fans. Don't buy this DVD If you love empire records. You're better off just saving your money for the non-special edition DVD and just watching whichever deleted scenes are available on that. This version of the movie is TERRIBLE...definitely not worth the money.

There are the typical characters that are in teen movies ; the mean, rebelious kid, the ""not quite there"" slacker metalhead, the stoner, the sensitive and poetic semi-loner, the dumb, slutty girl, the philosophical genius/screwup, and the goody-goody overachieving girl.

Synopsis: Lucas altruistically pilfers (and loses) $9,000 from Joe, his employer at Empire Records. Joe, who surely must be the most understanding boss in the history of gainful employment, also oversees half a dozen other hip, zany and damaged young adults at the store. Joe can't bring himself to either fire Lucas or call the police, so everybody at the store bands together to find a way to raise the money, lest everybody find themselves hittin' the bricks in search of new jobs.

That's the whole thing! Certainly, Hollywood has done more with less; unfortunately, ""Empire Records"" consistently delivers less than what you'd expect. Case in point: the DVD case boasts ""one of the most dynamic song scores ever."" Ha! ""American Graffiti"" it ain't. Another thing: for a lighthearted romp, it's rarely actually funny.

I could go on, but I did say I was going to keep this review short.

Despite a number of promising situations scattered throughout the movie -including shoplifting, true love, pranks, promiscuity and a disasterous publicity visit by teen heartthrob Rex Manning - overacting and poor timing ruin everything. And, no matter what the filmmakers tell you, SPLASHING WATER ON SOMEONE'S FACE WILL NOT CURE HER OF AMPHETAMINE ABUSE/ADDICTION!

739609,5,6303954138,"i finally got around to seeing Empire Records, and it's an awesome movie. Much like in the same mold as Dazed and Confused and Almost Famous, the cast is rock solid, the music is awesome, and movies are great.

Empire Records is about a music store owner and his employees who are on the verge of being sold and turned into Music Town, a national music retail chain which doesn't allow revealing clothes, tatoos, and other such things that Empire Records doesn't really care too much about.

They have one day to figure out how to come up with the money after one of the employees, Lucas, takes the money from the night before, finds out about Music Town, and decides to try his luck in Atlantic City to save the store and his friends.

The cast is completely awesome and contains many young and up and coming actors (1995 movie), including Liv Tyler, Renee Zellwegger, Rory Cochrane (Dazed and Confused), Robin Tunney, and Ethan Randall (Can't Hardly Wait).

one of the best parts of the movie is the kid who plays the Shoplifter and goes by the name of Warren Beauty.

739692,4,6303954138,"Wouldn't we all like to work at a job where the employees are like family? In an environment where even when we screw up royally, everyone ultimately has our backs in the end - even our boss? If those ideas weren't appealing enough on their own, let's throw another one in for good measure: this utopia of a job is located in a music store. If this sounds right up your alley, then you too can live vicariously through the kids in the film Empire Records. This movie is an accurate snapshot of a (somewhat) carefree youth during the height of '90s culture, and it even has an exciting soundtrack to complement it.

Empire Records tells the tale of a group of young kids who work in a record store named Empire Records, natch. While closing the store one night, Lucas (Rory Cochrane) discovers that the Music Town franchise is going to try to take over the store. So, of course, he makes the (poor) snap decision to head to Atlantic City with $9,000 of the store's bank in his pocket in an attempt to gamble up enough dough to save the store from succumbing to ""the man""'s (corporate) clutches. Of course, Lucas loses it all and the rest of the film takes place over the course of one day, which just happens to be ""Rex Manning Day"" - the day said celebrity (Maxwell Caulfield) is due to arrive at the store for a meet-and-greet.

Corey (Liv Tyler) has been patiently waiting for ""Rex Manning Day"" so that she can offer Manning her virginity. Gina (Renee Zellweger) is the promiscuous friend who has always been secretly jealous of how straight-edged Corey is, a bitterness that intensifies when Corey finds out she has been accepted to Harvard. Meanwhile, little does Corey know that this is a special day for co-worker A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) as well - he is determined to tell Corey that he loves her by 1:37 p.m., and not a minute later.

Continuing this eventful day is Deb (Robyn Tunney), who comes into work and immediately shaves her head. Later, it is revealed that she had also tried to commit suicide the night before after a fight with her on-and-off lover, Berko (Coyote Shivers). Rounding out the group is Mark (Ethan Embry [as Ethan Randall]), the adorable comic relief of the film who won't let the horrible events of the day ruin his sunny demeanor. And Anthony LaPaglia is endearing as Joe, the boss with a heart of gold who is more dad than boss. Scenes of equal parts hilarity and chaos ensue, such as when a customer tries to shoplift some CDs, or when Mark eats hash brownies, and the film ultimately culminates in a gooey, feel-good ending.

A note to super-fans about the ""Remix! Special Fan Edition"" of the DVD: it is, in a word, disappointing. While most DVDs allow you to view deleted scenes separately, this version is entirely uncut. Some scenes are helpful (for instance, you can better understand why Cory runs out of the room when Manning agrees to have sex with her), though some scenes add nothing to the film, and it's understandable why they were ultimately cut.  Like in the beginning when Lucas has a ""deep"" discussion with a customer that he lets in after hours. This is nothing more than filler.  There's also an unnecessary alteration to the ""why don't you all just fade away?"" line.

The ""Remix!"" DVD puts a heavier focus on the music, rather than the film.  As a fan, you might be psyched about this - and rightfully so - though sadly, you shouldn't be. The film's soundtrack, which features artists like the Gin Blossoms and the Cranberries, is the epitome of '90s alternative rock, and the cover of the DVD conveniently lists the songs by the scenes they accompany. So for example, if you feel like listening to ""'Til I Hear It From You"" from the Gin Blossoms, you can skip to the scene that features that song. This is a fantastic feature, and one that should accompany all other music-heavy films and TV shows that are burned to DVD. However, the down side here is that the volume on this particular DVD is amped up exponentially. The end result is that you have to crank up the volume to hear the dialogue and when the music comes on, you get blasted off of the couch.",1248998400,7,4115,4.551351351351351

1. Robin Tunney as Deb. This was the most annoying character I have ever encountered. She is pretentious and snotty -- and not in a way that makes sense or is tolerable.

2. The actor who played Warren...how did that kid every land acting jobs? I saw him in one other movie and he was terrible there too.

And is holding onto a teen fantasy of losing her virginity in romance novel style to her heart throb. The weird girl working through depression and thoughts of suicide. A wanna be thug and miserably bad shoplifter that just needs to belong to something. To the washed up old pop star that tries to pathetically hold onto his youth and career.

""Empire Records"" is in trouble. It's fun loving, easy going staff may soon have to conform to rules, as a franchise is planning to buy it up. Lucas (Rory Cochrane) is something of a thinker, and he has an idea. Joe the manager (Anthony LaPaglia) has left Lucas in charge of closing, and in charge of the day's takings. Lucas takes these takings, all the way to Atlantic City, in the hope that he can triple the money in a game of dice. He ends up losing it all, causing a whole lot more trouble for the store. Thanks to the takeover and the financial trouble, Empire Records only has one more day left, and the young and quirky staff decide to make it count. One decides to declare his love to a co-worker, another decides he'll start a band. A couple of the girls come on to the sleazy in-store pop star, while another stages her own funeral. A lot of conversations are had, a lot of feelings are aired and a lot of music is played.

It's quite nicely cast, I thought. It's interesting to see a young Liv Tyler and Renee Zelwigger interact with each other. Can't say I'm the biggest fan of the soundtrack, though.

739852,5,6303954138,"This film is not like other films - even in the same genre - even with similar plots, themes, or concepts. It has an ineffable, intangible quality.

At root, its a film about vitality, love, friendship, disillusionment, growing up, hope, youth, ambivalence and confusion - all at a specific cultural and historical point that either speaks to you or it doesnt.

The intensity of emotion as a teenager, as we ALL remember, is overwhelming. All these ideas and concepts and truths are competing on a daily basis. Even though we age, change and get harder to the world, our emotional core always seems to reside and linger in this teenage past. This film ressurrects these feelings - and almost confusingly, the actual SENSE of having these feelings at a particular time and place. You are continually inspired to draw parallels with your own life, appropriating the character's idiosyncrasies for yourself, and characters from your past. Alongside this, you somehow cant help placing yourself within Empire Records itself; you are powerless against this urge to ""join in"" and fantasise about being part of this fictional teenage life you never had, where inner thoughts and feelings are acted out and played out rather than wrestled with internally - like in your own mundane adolescence. Yes, even as an adult the film still does this, but with added nostalgia as each year passes.

This is one viewpoint on understanding the film's power, and the devotion of so many people. But there's something else.

All fans of this film sense it, but cannot encapsulate it into words easily. There are hundreds of reviews of this film across the web, and people either hate it ot love it; Empire Records polarises opinion to such a degree, and in such stark terms that this IS evidence of an intangible quality.

How do you account for the astonishing gap between critics - ""an awful film, 1/10"" - and fans: ""Ive seen this 100 times""?

Tell me one other film that has over a hundred critic reviews describing it as ""truly awful"". AND hundreds and hundreds of public reviews decrying it the ""best film ever, life changing, ive seen it over 100 times"". Or, another film that is BETTER as an adult, 11 years after watching it as a teenager. No, you cant because there is something unique and interesting going on here. I wish i could put it into words, but if you ""get it"" then you ""get it"". Its that simple.

This is definitely not the edition that this fan wanted.",1145318400,6,349,4.4375
739854,4,6303954138,"Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about ""Empire Records"". An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as ""getting it"" which you would use explain the positive/negative reactions to ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Nashville"", or ""Clockwork Orange"".

The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching ""Times Square"", ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""New Waterford Girl"", or ""Empire Records"". An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality: "".....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts....."". The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with ""Empire Records"" and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.

What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of ""Empire Records"" as the ""American Graffiti"" of the 90's, a similar ""one-day"" structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like ""The Big Chill"", as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of ""Ghost World"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" will enjoy ""Empire Records"" but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid ""Empire Records"".

It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings.  I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level.  For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away.  They are the two people who care the most about her.  Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most in the world.

My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe an the store.  So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.

My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' ""Romeo and Juliet"", the editor cuts between characters, coming back to ""Juliet"" Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.

Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion: ""Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?"". The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.

The ending is a mix of the ""Times Square's"" ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.

""Empire Records"" has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.

Between the lip-syncing rock videos the actors perform every five minutes, and the inept dialog, I began to ponder who the target audience is supposed to be.  Even the Teenie-boppers who are supposed to relate to these exaggerated characters are still wondering why they wasted thier time on this movie.  At first glance, I thought this movie would be along the lines of Mallrats, but to my dismay it has more in common with ""From Justin to Kelly.""

739858,4,6303954138,"For the most part, I don't enjoy the current wave of teen films (such as the Scream series, though I am a horror fan), as they seem entirely too fake and cheesy (the only one I truly liked was 10 Things I Hate About You, basically because I like the entire cast). Where Empire Records did seem fake (the story line of an employee blowing $9000 of the store's money gambling and the boss deciding to pay it out of his own pocket is ridiculous), for some reason I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I think the story in this film is quite a bit better than most in this crazed genre, and its one that keeps your attention. Why? I'm not quite sure. I think one of the reasons could possibly be that I have always wanted to have a job like that. I always wanted to work to be a fun place to go to, one that you did not mind going into day after day. In some ways, it reminded me of a job I once had, as my coworkers were great, and we considered our managers as friends, and we had fun at work while we actually got things accomplished, but not to the extent of fun these people had. The acting in this film is quite good, surprisingly. There is only one actor (the stoner) who I found to be quite unlaughably bad (so bad he's not even funny). Where most of the actors aren't overly known (Johnny Whitworth, Rory Cochrane), they do their parts convincingly, yet failed to make a name for themselves. I found both of those actors to be quite good, yet I'd never seen them in anything before. Other key players (Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler) have become more `mainstream' after Empire Records. I'd been recommended this film several times since its release, and I never thought it seemed interesting enough to sit down and watch it. I'm certainly glad I saw it, however. I believe the film has a certain rewatchability that I look for in films (that so many films lack). Though I don't think this film would be considered cult just yet, it certainly will gain that status some day along with the dozens of other teen movies in the genre. In another ten years or so, people will look back upon these films and undoubtedly laugh at them the way we now laugh at films from the 1980s. I am not a fan of this genre mainly because I find it quite ridiculous that they portray `teens' (however, most of the time the actors portraying these teens are actually in their 20s, which is another thing that bothers me) acting the way they do. It's even more disturbing to see some idiotic people follow the lead of these `teens' and act like this in real life, which I see more and more, and tend to avoid people like this. I do think that when looking back on this genre after 20 years that this film will be considered one of the better ones.

When this happens, and it happens at least twice a week, I stand up and after I finish chewing I let them know the real scoop. The best performance ever given by Zellwigger is in this movie. She is totally hot and acts really good. Now she looks like a freaky science experiment like every other A list hollywood star. In this movie, she's positively delicious. Liv Tyler is also in it but I'm not into her at all. She looks like her dad. If you are a dude and like Liv Tyler that means you're secretly in love with Steven Tyler. Deal with that! Sinead O'Conner gives an inspired performance as a suicidal bald chick that works at a record store. That really wasn't much of a stretch because she's whiny anyway. I don't know what dudes were in this movie because they all were losers to me. There was no performance that even came close to Billy Zabka in Karate Kid.

I worked at a record store in Omaha growing up called ""Hey, would you like to buy some music?"". It was me and Kroll and a bunch of totally hot music store girls that dug us. We got the buzz on all of the hot new bands like Counting Crows, Blisterpuss(the ending is pronounced like bus) and Captain Donkeyface and the diseased five. We told kids not as cool as we were about these bands and only enhanced our image as the most in style kids in Gretna. I even wore Generra! We hooked up with all of the girls and got free tapes.

Empire Records is truly a fun extremely down to Earth teen comedy. This was probably the last of the true comedies that really gave it's audience a true life look at a bunch of kids just trying to have a good time during their supposed last day of work. `Empire Records' is a blend of `Dazed and Confused' and `Clerks' and is a great watch from start to finish filled with crazy antics and mindless philosophical conversation. The cast is truly one for the record books. This is the only movie I probably will ever enjoy with Renee Zelweger in it...and its quite strange seeing her play the role of a labeled slut. Liv Tyler has an excellent breakthrough performance and of course we all know where she went. The best cast member by far is the highly recognizeable face of Ethan Embry. Every scene he in, is flat out comic genius, it is a darn shame he can't get signed on to other successful projects because he really does have talent. I guess you can blame corporate Hollywood for that.

What makes this movie truly memorable is the soundtrack. `Empire Records could not have come out at a more perfect time. It was the final year of the early 90s grunge era. With music from bands like Sponge, Gin Blossoms and The Cranberries, like the bands the movie has become a cult classic for those who know that music is the best way to stick it to the man.",1120608000,3,1510,4.298245614035087
739923,3,6303954138,"This farce, directed by Allan Moyle (Pump Up the Volume), boasts a solid cast of then young and hungry actors that are dynamite throughout the film, even though it's script is horribly inept.  Empire Records focuses around the exploits of the employees of a local independent record store managed by Joe (Anthony LaPaglia), whose business is on the brink of being bought out by a music store chain, and the situation becomes worse off when his prodigal son and employee (Rory Cochrane) gambles away the store's bank deposit.  In the midst of all this, a pop music celebrity (Maxwell Caulfield) pays the store a visit, which naturally, results in more chaos, and not to mention late teenage pining, whining, and moshing to Gwar.  The script is lame, but the cast (which also includes Liv Tyler, Renee Zelwegger, Ethan Embry, Debi Mazar, and Robin Tunney) is electric throughout the film, and they save it from mediocrity.  This ""remixed"" edition of Empire Records features additional scenes integrated back into the film, which surprisingly add a bit of character development and some laughs.

739924,1,6303954138,"This movie wants you to like it so bad, and heck, so did I! If I'm going to devote my time to a movie for an hour and 45 minutes, then of course I'm hoping for it to be good. Alas, the Lord did not damn my eyes before the play button was pushed, and I was forced to watch this clich-ridden, horribly acted, melodramatic, implausible  defecation onto the tastes of young people everywhere.

It starts promisingly enough - it's set in a record store! Hey, I love music, so this movie must be awesome! It's not even a chain so that must mean that the owner is super cool and they'll be playing some great tunes. Again, built up to be let down: this is no High Fidelity. The teens are obviously just punching in hours at a lax workplace for minimum wage. The music is just rotten, don't kid yourself, it's rotten.

But wait a second, aren't movies supposed to be primarily focused with plot and character? Yes, of course! How could I be so shallow? I suppose you've recognized the pattern by now, and are undeniably anticipating the next butchering. Problem: the kids can't act. Problem: the characters are one dimensional, and worst of all annoying. Rory Cochrane's awesome embodiment of the happy-go-lucky stoner in Dazed and Confused proves to be just a caricature of someone I can love, rather than an emotional sadsack who seems to have a big bad rain cloud over his head. The rest of the characters in no particular order: spaz, slut, loverboy, confused girl, depressed kid, and troublemaker. The razor-thin plot involves a loss of necessary funds (which the owner amazingly forgives in the span of 15 minutes) and the quick fund raiser that saves the business, which unfortunatley involves MORE BAD MUSIC.

It's movies like Empire Records that are really lowering the bar for quality perception among teenagers. They go to the theater, see how cool these kids are made out to be, and accept it as fact. They're cool, their music's cool, their attitudes are cool, no questions asked. This isn't an issue of whether this movie is an Oscar contender, it's an issue of this being a really really bad movie. I've never made a formal list, but I've always mentioned whenever I hear the name brought up that this is the worst movie I've ever seen.",1110499200,9,2243,4.614035087719298

Although there are interesting characters in the movie, I feel the development of story isn't elaborate enough to appreciate them.

But it seemed like the volume was really pumped up for all the songs--so if we had the volume at a decent level to hear the dialogue, I felt like my ears were getting blasted when the music came on.

The plot is relatively simple, but it works very well for this movie. Empire Records is an independently owned, hip, happening, and altogether exciting music store that is on the brink of being bought out by Music Town, a large music chain. Needless to say there is a bit more that goes on, but not a lot more.

Lucas (Rory Cochrane) is a very unusual individual working at Empire Records and on his first 'close' decides, on a whim, to take $9,000 and gamble it at a casino. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out well and the store comes out on the bad side. Joe (Anthony LaPaglia), the store manager, is less than impressed to find the store's takings gone and this results in some hilarious antics. Meanwhile, Debra (Robin Tunney) is a teen with an attitude aching for attention, A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) is pining for Corey (Liv Tyler) who is pining for Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield). The store psycho, aptly named Berko (Coyote Shivers), does his best to constantly play death metal while Gina (Renee Zellweger) does her best to wear as little as possible. That is by no means a bad thing. Will Empire Records survive or will it be overrun by a heartless, funless, corporate institution? - Well, that is for me to know and you to find out!

739980,4,6303954138,"Allan Moyle's EMPIRE RECORDS (1995) is pretty much as how I described it in the title of this review. Although it's essentially a comedy, it contains disparate elements that are off-putting at times. Still, it manages to work. The director, Allan Moyle, had previously directed the similarly uneven PUMP UP THE VOLUME (1990), which starred Christian Slater in a truly inspired and star-making performance. In this film, he directs an intersting combination of dependable character actors (Anthony LaPaglia and Maxwell Caulfield, both Australian actors playing Americans) and up-and-coming young actors who would eventually make it big (Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler and Tobey Maguire), combines them into a quirky, often-meandering script---and somehow makes it all work.
Here's the setup: In a large but independent record store (in Wilmington, Delaware, of all places), Empire Records, which has been around since 1959 (as the large neon sign out in front constantly reminds us & the store's customers), a trusted employee named Lucas (an inspired performance by no-name actor Rory Cochrane) is put in charge of closing the store one night by the responsible but boring store manager Joe Reaves (LaPaglia), when he experiences a kind of epiphany when he lets in a strange girl after Midnight (when the store closes, another fact of which the movie is always seeming to remind us). After a sort of weird conversation which essentially leads to nowhere, Lucas finds in the boss' office plans to sell Empire Records to behemoth Music Town. This will not do, and the now-philosophically-transformed Lucas decides to drive to Atlantic City, New Jersey with the store's $9,000 in the day's proceeds to hopefully win enough money to buy out the store and thus prevent it from being ""sold out to the man."" He puts it all on the line for a game of craps, winning on his first roll and doubling his stash to $18K. Feeling  really lucky, he decides to do it again...and craps out. Dejected, and seemingly in shock, he returns back to the store, wondering how he'll explain it all to Joe. In the morning, well, let's just say that everything hits the fan...and then some! With fading pop star Rex Manning (Caulfield) scheduled to make an autograph-signing appearance that day, and lovestruck, seemingly innocent store employee Corey Mason (Tyler) practicing to meet and seduce him, and her (...) friend and fellow employee (Zellweger) with her own tricks up her sleeveless blouse, and a death-obsessed, head-shaving Goth fellow employee (Robin Tunney) who just plain has issues, and a 16-year-old pathological shoplifter who calls himself Warren Beatty, the pot is all stirred up on this day, after which you can be sure that none of the principals will ever be the same.
I loved Anthony LaPaglia's nuanced performance, as a thirty-something guy  in a position of authority who really feels just as put-upon as any of his employees, who wants to kill his thieving underling for betraying his trust, and yet can't help covering for his mistake and trying to help him. Indeed, Joe tries to be everyone's father figure while still haplessly trying to exert control over the situation. It shows yet again that Anthony LaPaglia is one of the most underrated actors in the world, even to this day. Also welcome is Renee Zellweger in a young, pre-JERRY MAGUIRE role in which she, surprisingly, takes on a bad-girl role and plays it very believingly (and gets some of the best lines in this film). She is one of my favorite actresses today, and this role shows that she had bigger and better things coming up ahead for her. Liv Tyler is fresh-faced, beautiful and just shining through in her role that is not quite as simple as it initally seems to be. Her interplay with Zellweger makes for some of the best scenes in this film. Also,  Debi Mazar is good in her cynical role as Rex's publicist who secretly can't stand the self-obsessed jerk. Lastly, Tobey Maguire has a small role as a stoner named Andre that's good for a look.
Whether or not you will like EMPIRE RECORDS just depends on whether or not you go for quirky, young-casted independent films...and also if you go for big 70's, 80's & 90's-filled rock'n'roll soundtracks, with diverse songs that permeate every scene. It also helps if you like Anthony LaPaglia, Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler! I found it far more satisfying than the overrated John Cusack-starring-love-dud HIGH FIDELITY (2000). Although it has some fairly racy language and situations at times, EMPIRE RECORDS is a solidly PG-13 film that is appropriate for most kids over the age of 10. They're also sure to enjoy the music!

Not only is the movie great, but the music is too. Basically the movie is about a group of young adults who work in a record store. One of them gambles away the store's money, and the store is in risk of being shut down and reopened under new management. That's only the umbrella, as there are many intertwining storylines that occur under the brim. It's just a great movie that will touch you and make you feel good. Great performances all around. There's not enough good I could say about this movie. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you go out and buy it or rent it right away, you are missing out on a truly great movie.",1074038400,2,766,4.289655172413793

Anyway, it's obvious why the deleted scenes were deleted, but they do provide some background info that isn't really given in the final movie.
It's a good teen movie and while I wouldn't recommend it to really young kids, and the plot line is basically nonexistant, it's fairly hilarious.  It's got a really great soundtrack, too and a great setting.

From Lucas and his well meaning, albeit strange, tactics to Cory and her struggle with teenage pressures, this is a fun-loving film that is definitely worth the time to watch.
You will recognize the faces of these young stars.  It is nice to get a glimpse into their early projects.  Liv Tyler and Rene Zellweger are very good  - although not comparable to their later films.

740057,5,6303954138,"The story goes as such: A group of well cast teenagers find out that their beloved record store (in which they are all employed) will be going out of business. Over the course of the worst day imaginable, they all try different ways to raise money to save ""The Empire"" from going under - and are pretty unsuccessful - until the end, that is!
This is a great teen movie! Full of great music (with a killer soundtrack), hilarious characters (my favorite is Lucas), really funny scenes and an actual believable plot. Every main character in the story has a story of their own, so it's not just a one dementional look at a bunch of kids dancing around a record story.
Corey (Liv Tyler) is a beautiful, hardworking, college-bound, daddy's girl, do-gooder, perfectionist ... who just so happens to be a speed freak. AJ (Johnny Whitworth)plays the nice boy who finishes last that is in love with her. Jeanna (Renee Zellwegger) is Corey's friend - actually she's EVERYONE'S friend according to her reputation - she's even friends with Rex Manning - the washed up child celebrity of the 70's -think a modern day Leaf Garrett- who's trying to hold on to his career by making an appearance at the record store. Deb plays the mysteriously suicidal grunge girl with a shaved head and bandages on her wrists. Mark is the weird but lovable guy in a band without a clue. Lucas is an eccentric and hilarious weirdo who takes 9,000 from the stores safe to Atlantic City and gambles it away in an attempt to change the fate of the store. ""Warren"" is a smart mouthed punk who Lucas catches shop lifting an eclectic variety of cd's and spends most of the movie sitting on the couch with Lucas until the cops pick him up. And finally there's Joe. Poor Joe. He's a 30something, stressed out, divorced drummer and manager of Empire Records who, thanks to the characters listed above, is having a nervous breakdown.
This is a great movie. Everyone I know loves it. Highly recommended!",1069545600,,1959,4.632183908045977
740058,5,6303954138,"Empire Records is managed by a man named Joe ( Without a Trace's Anthony LaPaglia ). The store is in danger of being shut down unless he can come up with the money to buy it himself. One of the employees named Lucas ( Rory Cochrane)decides to take the night deposit off to Las Vegas in an attempt to help Joe out. Unfortunately, he loses all the money, and the owner of the store is coming by later the next day to pick up the deposit. The next day proves to be an interesting one as Joe struggles to get the $7,000 bucks back, and we are introduced to all of the different employees. Corey (Liv Tyler)is in love with rock star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield). He is coming to Empire for a signing. She wants to lose her virginity to him. This is upsetting to A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) because he is in love with Corey and must think of a way to convince her that he is the right one. Warren ( Brendan Sexton)is a kid who gets caught shoplifitng, and tries to hit Joe up for a job. The rest of the colorful crew includes an antisocial girl with suicidal tendencies named Debra ( Robin Tunney), a pot head named Mark (Ethan Embry), and a nymphomaniac named Gina ( Renee Zelwigger). But despite their differences, they are forced to come together when they learn that their beloved record store might be shut down for good.
""Empire Records"" is without a doubt one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The script is outstanding, and provides for oustanding dialogue and a well rounded story. Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, Robin Tunney, Rene Zellweger, Liv Tyler, and Brendan Sexton are all phenomenal. It is impossible to choose a favorite because they all are equally good and bring something to the story. One of the things that I love most about this film, is the fact that it is not ruined by a bad ending. The ending of the film is actually great and it wraps up the film quite effectively. The soundtrack to this film is great. It includes music from the Gin Blossoms, The Cranberries, Better than Ezra, and a lot more.
All I can say is that you should buy this film. The story is outstanding, all of the actors are outstanding, the ending is great, and the music is wonderful. Every aspect of this film comes together to achieve one thing : perfection. This DVD is definately the way to go, because it was released with an extra 16 minutes of unseen footage, as well as 4 additional scenes, and three music videos.",1069113600,,2461,4.458980044345898

740125,5,6303954138,"This movie, I suppose, has been labeled as a 'teen-movie', but it seems to be one of the better ones, especially since (few?) people have seen it, but if you do not want to rent it, VH1 occasionally plays it, but of course you get some wonderful editing (which just seem to ruin movies, anyone seen Me Myself and Irene on TV?).
The movie takes place in Empire Records, which is essentially your local record store, and, go-figure, has some interesting things going on during the day. Who would have seen that coming?
Anyways, one of the employees, Lucas, is asked to close the store, with simple instructions from the boss, Joe, to just keep his hands off his beer, his cigars, and his drumsticks, and to count the money twice. Well, Lucas finds how Mitch (the top-guy) wants to change Empire to a Music Town franchise. So, Lucas takes the $9,000 from the store and goes to Atlantic City, plays craps, wins the first time, plays a second, and loses it all.
And that sets up the rest of the film.
I won't say anything more about it, because I will wind-up being repetitive, so if you want to see a movie that is actually decent in these years of cinematic [pooh], see Empire Records.",1059436800,2,1182,4.476851851851852

So as were watching he is telling me ""oh watch this, oh watch that."" Which I find rather cute. Anyways getting to the point.
  As I am watching this movie, I am slowly falling in love. This movie (containing some great actors: Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, Ethan Embry and etc...)Shows you how weird and twisted life is by showing you different examples with different workers of the store Empire Records.
  For Example: Debra is a messed up girl who tried to kill herself and then impulsively shaves her head in the employee's bathroom. Then there is the Gina, the slut who sleeps with most men and in turn hurts friends with sleeping with one man imparticular - Rex Manning (Oh Rexy, you're so sexy!). Then we come to Cory, the straight A student who wants to give her virginity to a ""Rock star""-Rex Manning and who doesn't seem to see that she has the love of a fellow employee. This employee is non other than A.J. A.J is an artist-who likes to glue- and is a bit emotional. He decides to tell Corey that he is in fact in love with her (at 1:37, to be exact). Then we come to Mark, Mark is the freak who is high but only naturally high- he seems high but too jumpy to be high- and likes his rock music and sugar. Finally we come to Lucas, now Lucas starts us off by being the ""rotten seed."" Lucas foolishly gambles and loses something very important to Joe (Joe is the manager) then Lucas must sit on the couch all day thinking of what he did while he has suddenly become ""Like the Chinese Guy""-according to A.J.

Now, I have given you a synopsis, without revealing too much. If I have given you the wrong impression making it seems like a stupid teenage movie, please reconsider. This movie truly is great for anyone of any age. Watch and you shall see.
Oh, did I forget to mention the awesome music? Well, in short, the music is not only minded blowing it is, well, cosmic. They have songs such as the surefire hit ""Video killed the radio star"" and also have some made up songs called ""Say no more, Mon amour"" which is highly orgasmic-and highly hilarious. But to end this fantastic music variety is the Coyote Shivers feat. Renee Zellweger ""Sugarhigh."" My friends and I personally love it. The tune is killer and the lyrics are mind blowing.

 If you're here, you obviously know the story that is Empire Records. It's a great actual coming-of-age film that has the ability to touch on subject that is relatable to any person between the ages ... well, of any age. There are great performances (Liv Tyler, Renee Zellwegger, Robin Tunney, Ethan Embry, the whole cast!), the film's many subplots never run into each other, and the soundtrack has got to be near one of the best and biggest of any movie.
 The additional 16 minutes added into the movie gives more character development to certain characters, new little scenes obviously edited out for they supplied only minimum yet effective humor, and some stuff that would have rallied the actual storyline. There are 2 of the 4 deleted scenes that makes the infamous Sexy Rexy an actual good guy, and also include an unseen performance of Mon Amour by Coyote Shivers, Renee Zellwegger, and Maxwell Caulfield (Rex) that was cut from the movie.
 Warner Bros. truly released this for the fans of Empire Records, a la Fan remix. But if given the chance, any person will easily take a liking to the movie. If you're into stuff like this.

740208,4,6303954138,"This is the sort of movie I do housecleaning to, because I can zip and dance around with a broom as I watch. Teeming over with great music (mostly rock, but other genres as well), ""Empire Records"" is a delightfully funny and endearing teen comedy, definitely a cut above average.
""The time to hesitate is through,"" quotes Lucas (Rory Cochrane), employee at Empire Records, when he finds that Empire is about to be sold to the massive chain ""MusicTown."" So he gambles away nine thousand bucks (the store's, not his) in an effort to increase the money and save Empire. Needless to say, his boss Joe (Anthony Lapaglia) is very, very angry -- since the money Lucas lost would have enabled him to buy a partnership in owning Empire.
The next day has an aging pop star, the arrogant Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) coming to Empire for a signing. Virginal superstudent Corey (Liv Tyler) is planning to have Rex as her ""first time,"" while her best pal A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) is planning to tell her how he feels about her. Lucas catches a very hostile young shoplifter (Brendan Sexton). There's also depressed Debra, and crazy Mark and Eddie. And as dark personal secrets spin out of control, the employees become determined to save their beloved music store. ""Damn the man! Save the Empire!""
Any movie that stars primarily teens is going to automatically be spat on by critics. But ""Empire"" knows it's not a serious movie, and it's happy that way. After all, people dance on the rooftops, shoplifting is a contact sport, and customers are pirouetting in the aisles with the clerks. Realism? Who cares? It's funny and cute. There's some romance (most of it is kept low-key, like Debra and Berko), a seduction or two, and about five seconds of violence.
The reviewer who said this was one of the most quotable movies ever is right: there are dozens of lovely lines in here. Best of those is A.J. rehearsing his profession of love: ""You make me feel like a bath. You're like vanilla ice cream -- FRENCH vanilla ice cream!"" Not to mention Joe's, ""He's the man, I'm the idiot, you're the screwup, and we are ALL losers."" And I love the soundtrack, teeming over with the Cranberries, the Gin Blossoms, Better than Ezra, and dozens of others. Hard metal, rock, ballads, and so on -- some of it is background music, some of it has the cast singing and dancing along, and ""Sugarhigh"" is performed by Coyote Shivers and Renee Zellweger at the end.
The actors are also quite good. Anthony Lapaglia plays Joe with endearing frustration and crabbiness; Caulfield is good as the arrogant, slightly effeminate Rex. Liv Tyler swings between girlish sweetness and very occasional violent rage; Whitworth is cute and insecure as a guy who can't get the words ""I love you"" out of his mouth. Renee Zellweger is also great in an early role, never making the promiscuous Gina 2-D or slutty. And Rory Cochrane is great as the extremely dignified, human-fortune-cookie Lucas. Coyote Shivers (Tyler's real-life ex-stepfather), Robin Tunney, James Wills, and Ethan Embry (as the endearingly crazy Mark) round off the cast. The main sour note is Sexton, who is rather flat and over-the-top as Warren.
Overall, ""Empire Records"" is a wonderful light teen comedy, not stupid or gross, just cute. And it's a must for fans of good rock. (And if anyone can tell me what band did that ""I want some money"" song, I would be very grateful)",1045440000,35,3397,4.759322033898305

Empire Records is such a loveable film, and it will make anyone want to work in a record store. It revolves around a group of young people that work in a local music store named Empire Records. Well, one of the employees secretly finds out that the big boss is planning on turning their hip record store into part of a larger chain, so he takes all the money he was supposed to deposit for his manager, Joe, and - what else? Gambles with it! Of course, he ends up losing all the money, which is bad news for Joe, who was saving up the money to buy Empire Records and save it from going mainstream.
Now, we're on to the next day, when Lucas (the gambler) has to break the news to everyone. On top of that, they are having a signing session with Rex Manning - a washed up pretty-boy singer that nobody likes, except for one female employee who REALLY likes him (wink-wink, nod-nod). Then, there is another female employee who has tried to kill herself, a male employee who wants to tell one of his co-workers he loves her, and a shop-lifter who just wants to be one of the gang.
There are amazing performances all around. Mainly Rory Cochrane, who plays the dry, witty Lucas - I absolutely loved every single scene he was in. Anthony LaPaglia is great as the sometimes easy-going manager Joe. Liv Tyler is beautiful as usual, Renee Zelwegger plays her trampy character perfectly, and Maxwell Caulfield as Rex Manning is priceless. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do.

There are plenty of characters to relate to, almost too many it seemed at points.  The people themselves were plenty interesting and well scripted, but enough already...too many little side stories that took away from the main plot.
Do any of these people actually work?  Everyones either in the back room or dancing around the store while the occasional misfit mans the register.  The interaction with the store was pretty fun though, and the movie in general was mildly entertaining, but I felt like there was so much more potential for this thing to rock.

It follows the exploits of a variety of teens who work in an independent record store.  Fighting their own emotional turmoil they also have to fight to keep their store open when it transpires that one of the employees has spent all the savings.
The cast is of the type that about you'll recognise from elsewhere.  There's Liv Tyler (Lord Of The Rings) as a pretty swot from a rich family, Rennee Zellweger (Bridget Jones's Diary) as a bold-as-brass wannabe rock chick and Robin Tunney (The Craft) as a bald goth.  Even if you are focusing more on the big stars, the rest of the cast are just as good.
Those that criticise this seem to go along the lines of it not being serious enough, or having little to say about the generation that it presents us with.

For a film based on a music store it featured some of the worst music I have ever heard used in a movie soundtrack. This film did make me laugh several times and I think that's what saved it, at least for me anyways. This film also gives the feeling of a Kevin Smith film, and not in a good way either, it more or less feels like a poor attempt at writing in Kevin Smiths style. However, it had some really funny stuff, Ethan Embry as some kind of a crazy stoner, utterly unbelievable character but hey, that's movies and a pretty neat guy who sets off the events that drive 95% of the film, and a funny little shoplifter/gun toting madman, named Warren. This is also the movie to watch if you're into pretty, not so big but memorable starlets. This features Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger and yes, a skin headed Robin Tunney. This is the prettiest I have seen any of these ladies look on film.

740358,5,6303954138,"...save the Empire! I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times since it came out and it holds up to repeated viewings. Empire is a day and night in the life of a group of record store employees. What makes the Empire store so different is it is an independent store, and the group that works there is diverse and asthetically pleasing. There is the dim, brooding Lucas (the hot Rory Cochran who was also in Dazed and Confused); the even dimmer Eric; the even broodier Deb (The Craft's Robin Tunney); the stressed-out, underappreciated manager Joe (Anthony LaPaglia); trampy Gina (Renee Zellweger); goody-two shoes Cory (Liv Tyler); and the adorable, talented AJ.

When Rex Manning - a has-been TV star who sings some incredibly cheesy song that will stick in your head guaranteed - the Empire gangs lives are turned upside-down by love, lust, a shoplifter (who ends up with a job at the store by the end of the day), a shooting, and of course, one rager of a party! ""Damn the man! Save the Empire!"" Because of Lucas' faux pas the night before, Joe is nearly forced to let the store he loves be bought out by a no fun music store chain. But the Empire gang pulls together and raises enough money (""and some Bazooka Joe for karma"") to help get Lucas out of trouble and allow Joe buy the store from the owner who never really wanted it anyway.

Empire Records is an intersting twist on the often-told story of the good guys triumph over evil. This movie will not disappoint you at all if you can relate at all to being the underdog - or just want to have a good laugh and hear some great 90s music.

It's funny how one of the critic's say that the script is flawed, because a middle age man wrote it and that's not how teenagers talk.  I wonder how old he is, because as a teenager I didn't find the characters so far out and away from reality that the movie became unbelievable.

740452,5,6303954138,"Empire Records is a GREAT example of how a movie should be made these days. It takes a group of determined individuals with their own problems -- who all work at a record stored promptly titled Empire Records - and lets us look in on one day of their lives. It doesn't use the standard movie formula. Except for the fact that it has a happy ending. But when that ending comes, you don't want the movie to stop. You want it to continue into the next day to see if AJ and Corey's relationship makes it or if Gina decides to change her ""turbo slut"" ways and become the lead singer of a band. And even if Debi decides to take life as what it is.
 The cast really made this movie. They all may not be topnotch actors, but their performances were awesome. Renee Zellwegger and Liv Tyler gave believable performances, although I prefer Renee's performance better. Ethan Embry was a riot. The rest of the cast were awesome. There's also a cameo by Coyote Shivers, and the performance between him and Renee Zellwegger's character near the end made 50% of the movie. The dialogue used is also some of the most quotable dialogue ever in a movie. Many have already mentioned that, and it's true that is quotable. Another ""must mention"" is the soundtrack. It works VERY well with the movie, and the songs are very catchy tunes.

For some reason places like Empire and the like seem to draw the bizarre and unexplainable out of the void and plant them directly in your lap. That is what made this movie so much fun for me.
I loved how everything was laid out in this film, it really is pretty close to the level of both genius and sheer stupidity that goes on inside a kooky record store. Plus, I think we all need a friend like Lucas around, he's the type to stir up the dust life gets a little dull.

Boy was I wrong, the pretentious and uncaring Lucas is the exact kind of kid I would loathe in real life, but he is revered by his peers for stealing money from his boss and spending it all.
Then the boss gives a job to a kid (Warren) who not only steals 5 cd's from the store, but also shoots off a gun in the store, while holding the customers hostage.....huh?!?!
The stereotypes in this movie are so hideously represented, I'm wondering where the oriental(who knows karate), the african-american(who drinks 40s), and the hispanic(who is all the rage with the women) kids are. (probably waiting to be hired)

About a year or so later I was talking to a movie-buff friend who happened to mention how much she loved Empire Records.  Now, this was a no-nonsense type girl whose judgement I'd always respected, so I didn't take her endorsement lightly.  After we'd discussed it for a while, and she'd made a few thought-provoking points, I thought to myself, *maybe* I'll give it a second chance.  As it turned out, it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd remembered.  In fact, I just about fell in love with that kid Marc (Ethan Randall) - so goofy, so adorable, like a kid brother. I also noticed Coyote Shivers for the first time. (He plays punk-rocker ""Berko"", and does a rockin' rendition of 'Sugarhigh' on the rooftop at the end of the film.)  As a result of this second viewing, I went on to discover more of Coyote's music, which turned out to be pretty cool, and we even chat occasionally about the Ramones, the band that inspired him.  So, something good came out of it, all in all.  It's not a bad film, really, so long as you're not expecting too much.

740611,2,6303954138,"The story, such as it is, is that ""Joe"" (Anthony La Paglia, a mediocre character actor on his best day, and when he's the ""star"" of the film, you know you're in trouble) manages Empire Records, an independent store where the employees enjoy a laid back atmosphere where they can throw on loud music and start dancing or moshing every five minutes (Which they do, to the point of insanity at your expense).
But of course, the record store is about to be sold out to a generic chain, which will destroy this festive minimum wage party paradise forever. When one of the genius employees learns of this impending fate, he decides to take 9000 bones from the store till and go gamble it in Atlantic City so he can get enough money to save the store. Needless to say, he loses it on the first toss of the dice, leaving the next 90 minutes of the film to try and find a way to get the money back.
The young cast of record store employees includes some fairly well-known faces, including Liv Tyler as the sweet and innocent babe, Renee Zelwegger as the vapid, sex-obsessed babe, and Robin Tunney as the rebel-without-a-clue (or hair) babe. Most of the male side are pretty much unknown, at least to me. Rory Cochrane is the genius who decided to gamble the bosses money away, and who spends the remainder of the film being the ""intellectual"" one, although nothing that ever leaves his mouth is at all intelligent, clever, insightful, or funny. Neither is anything else in the film. It's one of these dismal teen angst comedies without much angst or comedy because you simply don't care about any of these boring pretty young people who think they are so ultra-hip. Liv Tyler looks gorgeous, but she can't act and I honestly wish she would quit trying. Go back to modeling. Renee Zelwegger is trying too hard to be like another actress even more mediocre than herself, Joey Lauren Adams (in fact, I thought it was her at first). I don't really blame the kids, though. With a script as cruddy as this one, they never had a chance.",971568000,5,2020,4.521857923497268

I had never heard of it, but a minute into it, you could find me crying with  laughing tears. It's been my all time favorite movie ever since. You must  go see it if you've been a teen before. All the characters give the movie a  different kind of humor that you'll love. Really, go rent it or even buy  it! You'll be very pleased that you did.",963360000,,490,3.9693877551020407

740614,5,6303954138,"Empire Records isn't just funny and entertaining - it pushes out many  messages that we seem to discard. The movie tells us that love can find a  way, second chances are given, there are people that DO care and you should  stay away from drugs. This movie has it ALL! Plus it has some fantasic  actors and sends out a great vibe! One of my favourite movies of all time!",962323200,,369,4.228571428571429
740615,4,6303954138,"This film got terrible reviews...plain and simple.  Why?  Because it  wasn't aimed at film critics ...at all.  The film is an experiment in teen  flicks along the lines of ""The Breakfast Club"" it chronicles the  lives of a bunch of angsty, depressed, manic teens over the course of a  single day, finding odd little ways to tell each of their stories.  It  definitely accomplishes this goal, using ""Rex Manning Day"" as the  vehicle for delivering half a dozen life stories without telling a boring  narrative.  Granted, it's doesn't have the most original plot, or Oscar  caliber acting, but it the film does what it sets out to do, and for this  reason, earned its cult following.  Watch this film and you will find  yourself quoting lines and recalling scenes.  If you're looking for a fun  romp with a story that will neither bore you, nor tax your mental reserves,  this is a great flick--lots of fun, quotable dialogue, and of course, great  music.  Both Cochrane and Embry give memorable performances as the night  manager, turned well meaning felon turned philosopher and the happy go  lucky stoner respectively.  The story line is a tad incongruous and  disjointed and some of the characters are stereotypical in their attempts  to shatter the stereotypes, but if you go in to this movie with the  expectations that it's just going to be a fun flick, you'll be satisfied.",959904000,63,1379,4.8068669527897

All my friends and I were  obsessed with it when it first came out, I mean who hasn't dreamed of  working in a record store? I mean all of our parents don't buy us Jeeps.  This movie rocks, it has heart and all of the characters arn't either  perfect or dogs, they are teens, or actors showing how it was when they  were teens.  A great ensemble teenage film that you can't be cynical about,  and if you are then you are just upset that this movie is just too cool for  you.  So the plot happens in a day, who cares that is the point! This movie  rocks, and will change your expectations.  I wish there had been more  nineties teen movies like this, this is great and so is the music (esp.  sugarhigh, a party fave.) Get it, turn it up and just enjoy.",959040000,13,940,4.17877094972067

I tried very eagerly to find a plot in this ""epic"", but all I found was a group of whiney losers (who can't act their way out of a box) who complain  about their terrrrrible lives. I should've known that it was horrible from  the back of the case:""A Killer Soundtrack"". What about a  storyline? It takes place over about a 3 hour period (except for the first  scene) and nothing really happens except a manic depressant cuts her hair,  the store gets ""robbed"" and some guy loses money. Big whoop! Oh, it  also has Liv Tyler in it...need I say more? It wouldn't let me leave the  rating at 0 stars...but believe me...1 star is a travesty to the way I  would REALLY rate this.",958867200,8,736,4.244604316546763

Well, I  introduced my coworkers to the fabulous, friendly fun of this video, with  all its quirky characters, and now we all love it!  You all know why this  movie is so great...because we thrive on quriky-ness and we all wish work  was so fun and spontaneous!  Great music, too!  Rory Cochrane is  ""SUPERB"" He has so many great lines plus a great shoplifter  scene.  And you know you get up and dance with the characters when Joe  starts rockin out to ACDC.

From start to finish, it's a classic romp from one characters life and  loves to the next.

741309,1,6303954138,"Well, I rented this movie expecting something along the lines of PUMP UP THE VOLUME, which I remembered enjoying when I was fifteen.  Instead, I was presented with perhaps the worst movie experience I've ever had the  displeasure to endure. Amazon.com's reviewer wrote that the dialogue sounds  like an Old Person's version of 'youngster speak'.  Well, I'm around the  age of these 'charicters' (I use this term loosely) and I agree: the  self-speech by the 'philospher' at the beginning of the movie warned me of  upcoming disaster.  I buckled in...and found myself alternatively laughing  and bemoaning the script, direction, and acting.
I think what struck me  most about 'Empire Records' were the steriotypical molds for '90's  teenagers, in all their angst.  Lets see: we have the Manic  Depressive, the Philosopher, the Perky Do-Good whose all wired on speed,  the gawky freak, the ""dude"" stoner... and on and on.  The music  was dated by the time this came out, and since this (supposidely) drives  the plot and action, all we are left with is a piece of trash that most  B-rated cult movies are superior to in the simple fact that they aren't so  earnest in their convictions.
