8343435,5,B001UE7CHY,"It would be called ""The Greatest Air Show On Earth"", if the camera were focused on the aircraft doing performances instead of being focused on the spectators and the jumbotron most of the time and didn't have stupid music playing to hide the noises of the aircraft. Not to mention, cutting the start of the show in half. Whoever filmed this didn't do a good job of filming the entire air show.",1471651200,,393,4.472222222222222
8343436,1,B001UE7CHY,"This is the worst video I've ever purchased.  It should have been called ""The Worst Video on Earth"".  I can't believe I got screwed out of $20.  I'm pissed.  This is just someone's armature video.  Don't waste your money.",1433376000,,221,4.564102564102564

8343438,5,B001UE7CHY,"Wow! I thought this was very good I live here at the shore near Atlantic city. The video is actually two years of air shows compiled into one DVD. The producer not only captures the video and roar of the jets but included music accompaniment. It took advantage of more than one perspective. The Thunderbirds demonstration  (the finale each year) was shot entirely off the end of one of the piers so it seemed as if you could touch the jets. I feel safe at this show because the jets and planes are over the water. If you ever saw this russian air show on youtube where a jet pancaked and went through the crowd you'll know what I mean about not being to close. That said this producer wisely included a lot of the show narration in the show. I still would have liked to see the face of the one girl wearing the  bikini. What was funny on more than one occaision was when jets appeared from behind the crowd and when the jet roar reached the crowd you could see them wince and jump from the surprise. This other review mentions that shots of the big screen were used to much. He did use it but I think because the planes would fly behind a big pier was the reason.
Anyway I liked the video a number of funny moments and a lot of ooh's and aaaaah's!",1248825600,,1247,4.191666666666666
8343439,1,B001UE7CHY,What a disappointment!! I think a rank amateur filmed this. I have seen home movies shot better than this.  We saw more of the people of the beach than planes.  Most planes were filmed from a distance or from the large screen set up for viewing on the beach. Not worth the money in my opinion.,1248048000,3,293,4.214285714285714
