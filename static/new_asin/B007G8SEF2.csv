Buy STARMAN on DVD today--this is a purchase that you will not regret!!!
***UPDATE #1--04/25/12: The picture and sound quality of this made-on-demand DVD set is absolutely superb!  I have no idea if any remastering was done, but STARMAN has never looked or sounded better.  The only drawback is the lack of Chapter Stops and/or Scene Select, but that's minor quibble to be sure.  THIS DVD SET IS AWESOME!!!  5 Stars all the way!!!",1331424000,78,3181,5.8068669527897
5084778,4,B007G8SEF2,Love the series but disc 2 did not play..  I ordered a replacement and that disc 2 did not play either.  Rest of the discs were fine.,1505174400,2,133,3.888888888888889
5084779,5,B007G8SEF2,"YOU MISSPELLED HAYS!!  ""Starman"" was a fabulous series that clearly showed a loving, supportive relationship between father and son.  It was superbly produced and wonderfully acted, to the point that there's still an active fandom 30 years later.

5084783,5,B007G8SEF2,"Can some tell me why Michael Douglas produced this show. I have always thought it was strange to see his name in the credits since Michael Douglas has never been involved with Science fiction stories.
Also does anyone know why the song Starman by David Bowie was never used in the movie Starman and why it was never used in the TV series?
Thank you I love this show.

The series is like the original one and brings back wonderful memories. If you have watched this when it came out on TV and loved it, I don't know what you are waiting for. Buy it. If you never saw the series before but are a fan of (kind and a bit nave) extra terrestrials, you should love this. One of my favorite show of all time. A great follow up of the movie of the same name (with Jeff Bridges).",1477785600,4,512,3.9326923076923075

5084795,5,B007G8SEF2,"We loved the movie but did not expect this series to be as entertaining & well done as it is. The original writer wrote these also, so it is consistent with the movie. The stories are very uplifting & well done. It is excellent family entertainment as well as thought provoking. Very enjoyable.",1466467200,,294,4.566037735849057
5084796,5,B007G8SEF2,"This series is very thoughtful, well-written and well acted.  It's ashamed that it did not continue on, but I suppose it was too ""slow-moving"" for the times.  Unfortunately, I did not catch this when it came out originally, but glad to see it on dvd. Nice to see a show not all about sex, car chases, profanity and greed...there are many great lessons in these episodes that were enjoyable to watch.",1460678400,,399,4.605633802816901
5084797,5,B007G8SEF2,Loved the original movie so wanted to see what they did with this early 1980's series that picks up about 14 years after Jeff Bridges character left Earth. Robert Hayes did a good job of impersonating an alien who had no idea what it meant to be human or how to interact with 20th century society.,1456272000,,297,4.321428571428571

5084807,5,B007G8SEF2,"It's a classic that is worth watching again.

5084811,5,B007G8SEF2,"I thought the movie was fascinating. Then the series jumped ahead in time to unite starman and his son. I liked the episodes where he learns more about how the human society functions since it is so different from his world.

I couldn't help but see a correlation between this series and The Fugitive. In both they are hunted by the government and have to keep moving into new settings. And the protagonists are searching for a person who will enable their life to become normal again.",1435017600,,485,4.574712643678161
5084812,5,B007G8SEF2,"This is absolutely one of the best TV series ever, so much better than the movie. It's very inventive, very well written and acted. It's just a lot of fun going along with Starman as he explores our world, and Robert Hayes has such an expressive face. Christopher Barnes as his son is just very charming, and the relationship between the two is so warm and real. And for suspense there's a really nasty villain. It's unbelievable that they cancelled it after such a short run. Oh, well, they cancelled Star Trek too.",1433635200,,516,4.559139784946237
5084813,5,B007G8SEF2,"I love this show!  I had wondered why there wasn't a follow-up show to the original (Jeff Bridges) Starman, and what do you know....there was.  Wish it had gone on longer.  Too short of a life span for the series.  Dave in Colorado",1432857600,,231,4.3023255813953485
5084814,5,B007G8SEF2,"It took me 3 solid days of sewing in my sewing room to see (hear) this series.  I really enjoyed it.  I remembered small bits of it from when it was on TV many yrs. ago but this time I completely enjoyed it.
After seeing the original Star Man with Jeff Bridges it was hard to imagine another actor doing the main roll however the entire cast was perfect.  Continuations and remakes are seldom very good (Star Trek, Indiana Jones and a few other exceptions of course) but the casting for this series was great.
I got a lot of sewing projects done in those 3 days.  That felt good also.

5084815,4,B007G8SEF2,"I totally loved this series and had forgotten what a great series it was!  It was a shame that it was so short lived.  Thank Michael Douglas Productions for cutting it (being facetious here).  Would have loved for it to have run a few seasons at least.  At any rate, I do have a complaint and I think it's a semi-major one.  This is advertised as the ""complete series"", yet there are a lot of scenes in the beginning intro that are not in any of the selections -- for example, the intro shows Paul Forrester in a house confronting his son on who he is, another part shows him in a jail cell with his sphere and a jailhouse dinner plate slamming against the bars, the cell door unlatching etc... and a few other things -- NONE of this is in any of the videos in this supposed 'complete series'.  I fell like I've been cheater here and that I'm missing some of the series.  So, what's happened here?  Is Sony or Michael Douglas Productions selling it as complete when it is not???  Or is Amazon doing this?  Would like a response, actually....",1431216000,2,1041,4.319587628865979

5084820,2,B007G8SEF2,"Although it was what I wanted, the DVD's did NOT play in my 10 year old player. It is obvious I need to make sure about compatibility.

5084865,1,B007G8SEF2,"I usually love science fiction and I loved the movie ""Starman.""  However, I consider the TV episodes to be worthless and just too stupid and silly to be worth watching.

I watched the first four episodes before giving up and the only reason I made it that far is because I had high hopes after watching the movie.  It is a poor take-off of the TV series ""The Fugitive"" which I did enjoy and thought was very good.  I'm not surprised the TV episodes of the Starman was discontinued after one season.  I'm surprised it lasted that long.

It was disappointing that the Starman never learns human behavior despite the fact that he has excellent knowledge of the English language. It may be cute that a couple of times when told ""Just do what you see others do"" that his imitation is not appropriate for the situation.  However, after a while his inability to learn behavior that even young children or recent foreign students would quickly pick up is too unrealistic and silly to be enjoyable.

While it was obvious that the Starman in the movie was extremely intelligent, in the TV series both the Starman and his teenage son appear to have little more than average intelligence other than their ability to use the spheres.

Although it is difficult to search and watch in sequence, the ""Starman TV Series"" can be watched on YouTube and before purchasing the Series on DVD, I recommend watching a couple of episodes on YouTube to determine if you believe you will enjoy the series.",1367712000,3,1478,4.632183908045977

5084886,5,B007G8SEF2,"The video and audio quality of these DVDs is fantastic considering how long ago the series aired on ABC. I've been watching the episodes and though I wish there had been ""extras"" I am much more grateful for the fact that I finally do not have to worry about my poor, dilapidated VHS tapes that I recorded in LP/EP mode, 25+ years ago. I discovered to my horror a few years ago that one of the tapes had broken. These DVDs have been a long time coming.

1) A few reviewers commented on the lack of an episode listing on the packaging and I found this an odd oversight, too, so I just created my own, printed it out and stuck it inside the case. I've uploaded it as a customer image on the product page in case anyone else would find it useful.

2) A very minor quibble has to do with the episode titles on the DVD menus. Sony added ""The"" in front of ""Blue Lights,"" ""Peregrine"" and ""Grifters."" Back then, TV shows often did have the episode title appear during the show and STARMAN was one of them. It does not seem like it would have been difficult to make the menus match.

3) One of the reviews stated, ""The episodes are the complete original network episodes"" and after watching the DVDs I can say I think this is mostly correct. However, there are some differences:

OPENING THEMES

There were five different opening themes in the series as broadcast, but the Sony DVD set only uses three of them (not a big deal, just interesting to me). The music is the same in all of them; Dana Kaproff's peaceful and beautiful score. Visually, all the themes and their variations had clips from episodes that aired, or were clips from the never-broadcast presentation video used to pitch the series concept to ABC executives (e.g., father/son shaving, fire engine, stairwell confrontation, flying plate in the jail cell, etc.).

The first theme version had no dialog at all and was used only in episode #1, ""The Return."" This is the same on Sony's DVD set and matches the original airing.

On the Sony set, theme version #2 is used for episodes #2, ""Like Father, Like Son"" all the way through to episode #17, ""Grifters."" Version #3 is used to finish out episodes #18, ""The Wedding"" through #22, ""The Test."" If you watch the theme from only episodes #2 and #18 you'll notice the different video clips and dialog.

MISSING SPECIAL EFFECTS

*SPOILER ALERT* A friend of mine watched Sony's episode #15, ""Dusty,"" before I did and noticed this at about the 37 minute mark: When Dusty is confronted by bad guys and Starman uses his sphere, there's no blue light special ""sizzling"" effect around the neck and wrist jewelry the bad guys are wearing. After the bad guys leave, Dusty even comments, ""Did you see that, that weird blue light?"" *END SPOILER ALERT*

It seems very strange that the film Sony provided to the company who did the DVD mastering did not have these special effects, yet they were in the episode that aired.

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with Sony's release of the STARMAN series. If you watched this show back in the 80's, buying the DVD set is a must!",1353628800,11,3058,4.531760435571688

5084901,4,B007G8SEF2,"It's always a disappointing feeling to become emotionally invested in a television series produced before the time you were born and know it was cancelled as a result of low ratings according to the Nielsen Rating System. On some level, you know you have to brace yourself for the possibility of an end that will create a thousand questions and leave you dissatisfied with the result because it got axed despite the incentives to continue it.

To suffer the whiplash of dissatisfaction and pleasure from the journey you willingly embarked regardless of the `danger`, as well as knowing you have to acknowledge fact that all parties involved have moved on, done other things and put the show behind them is another factor the harsh realities of cancelled television that your racing mind doesn't include as a relevant when it comes to a stimulated imagination.

In 1984, John Carpenter and Bruce A. Evans wrote and directed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starman/dp/B000I9YV3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starman</a>"", a science-fiction/fantasy/romance that many to this day consider quite unlike what they come to think of as a ""John Carpenter film"". If anything it falls into the same obscure category as Carpenter's made-for-TV ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis/dp/B0030ATZI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis</a>"" film; it doesn`t scream ""John Carpenter!"" because of its pedestrian context. The apology for the then-reviled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>&nbsp;(1982)"", ""Starman"" chronicled the tale of a grieving wife (Jenny Hayden) who encounters a shipwrecked alien that adopts the appearance of her late husband (Scott Hayden). The alien, running on borrowed time, needs to reach Arizona in order to rendezvous with his kind when they arrive on earth and uses Jenny to get there. Openly hostile and frightened, Jenny is an unwilling escort for the nameless alien until she witnesses one simple act of kindness that changes her perspective on the mysterious `Starman'.

In 1986, actor Michael Douglas (I think) produced a twenty two episode television series with the same name that continued the story the film thought to simply leave to the imagination of the audience. However, instead of a tale centralized on the life of Jenny Hayden and her son, ""Starman (1986-1987)"" focuses on the return of the `Starman' in search for ""his son"", Scott Hayden, who's been seemingly abandoned by his mother and left in the care of a foster home after his foster parents are killed in a car accident that only he survives.

As something of a casual fan of John Carpenter (who admits she hasn't seen his entire filmography), I'm not a diehard lover of ""Starman"", but I do believe that next to ""The Thing"", it's one of his strongest theatrical efforts in his filmography that benefits not only from the performances of its actors, but Carpenter's approach toward the themes of love, death and humanity. Does the television series live up to the tall order created by its predecessor? Thematically, yes, it does. Aesthetically, it's an entirely different creature as a result of a different creative team and its serialized format.

As stated before, Jenny Hayden is largely absent from the narrative of the television series. The show focuses on Scott Hayden Jr. (portrayed by a then genuinely-teenage Christopher Daniel Barnes of ""Spider-Man"" fame) and `Paul Forrester' (Robert Hayes) as the two travel across the united states in search of Scott's mother who is believed to have gone into hiding shortly after the events of the original film. Scott, an otherwise capable young man, is stuck at the crossroads of adolescence and young adulthood without the guidance of a stable family and primarily, a father figure. Frustrated by the mystery that surrounds his life, he inadvertently calls out to his intergalactic father with the sphere given to him by his mother.

When the Starman returns to earth he adopts the guise of a deceased photographer named Paul Forrester --- a philandering louse of a man with a ""noble"" reputation as an activist that contradicts what the audience is briefly shown --- and seeks his son out. His return and actions inevitability draw the attention of federal agent George Fox (Michael Cavanaugh), the antagonist of the original film, and he and Scott are forced to go on the lam to avoid capture. Scott is initially indifferent toward the Starman, more interested in finding his mother than building a solid relationship with ""his father"". However, as time goes on, he lowers his defenses and allows the Starman into his heart. Scott helps the Starman reassert hisself back into society while the Starman teaches Scott how to harness his latent abilities.

The primary aesthetic of the show, according to Wikipedia, is said to be inspired by the likes of series like ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and it shows; the nomadic approach in which the Hayden and Forrester encounter seemingly nondescript and unimportant peoples in Podunk/out of the way towns keeps the show from falling into a monotony that would've plagued it if the entire focus was solely on how the two men got along with each other on the road while being hounded by the FSA and Fox.

However, like most shows with its fortunate episode roster, the formula does begin to grow tiresome and is only occasionally changed up when major narrative plot points in the story need to be addressed directly. On some level I can see why the show met an untimely end, it didn't do enough to in regards to variety to chase off boredom, but on the other, the potential it carried with the central story of Scott, Jenny and the Starman could've/should've guaranteed it another season with a pots worth of exploration. One the biggest misfires of the series I thought were its two part `finale' wherein Jenny is finally discovered by Hayden and Forrester. The episode goes to great lengths to keep Scott, Jenny and Starman separated from each other to the point of frustration. It's the very definition of stalling if I ever saw it. When Scott and his uncle go missing on the road to Jenny's, Starman is strangely indifferent about it. He doesn't look for them, doesn't try to use his sphere to contact Scott. Instead, the episodes chooses focuses more on the `romantic' aspect of Jenny and `Paul' (complete with awkward recreations of the film's climax) getting together instead of getting mother and son reunited as quickly as possible. It drove me up the wall, perhaps worse so than the ""Grifters"" and ""Fathers and Sons"" episodes. Jenny and Scott are never reunited, instead Jenny is captured off screen by the feds and the show ends with the men off to find her again with no clear cut resolution ever to be given.

It was like watching the end of ""Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994-1998)"" all over again. Mary Jane is never found on-screen, you just get the implication that Peter Parker is off to find her. ARG, I could eat my pillow at the mere reminder.

Other aspects that bothered me were the retconning or flubbing of important parts of the movie. The end of the film clearly states that Scott will be the child of Jenny and his late father, Scott I, because the Starman is a clone of Scott I. But the television series makes it seem like and implies heavily that Scott is the child of Jenny and the Starman in the sense that ""he"" is not Scott on any physical level, not the other way around. Then there's aspect of his being immediately knowledgeable about whatever the Starman knows; Scott is depicted as largely ignorant of his ""father's"" culture despite his age and he doesn't appear to aspire to be a teacher or take an interest in teaching on any level. Honestly, I don't think we ever get any real exploration into Scott's interests beyond school projects and needing to find his mother.

Another problematic aspect of the series is how their names are used as a narrative device to create tension; why is it never suggested or used by the writers that these characters forge some fake identities for themselves? Why is it that they constantly use their real names and behave as though there will be no consequences (like being chased out town by Fox) whenever they introduce themselves as father and son ""Scott Hayden"" and ""Paul Forrester""? I realize there was money to be made off of Forrester's identity alone, but the rest of the time was simply a sloppy excuse to have them move on elsewhere. Maybe this would be called nitpicky for some, but this is honestly the sticking point of the series that just irritates me the most.

Aside from that, the show, not unlike the film, is pretty dated in its aesthetic and audio; grating synthesizers dominate the incidental music and by God is it horrible. The environment is homogenously ""80s"" in the same sense a show is ""homogenously 90s"" in the 90s (right down to the clothing, the setting, dialog and sensibilities). It doesn't really hold up in the same way the 1984 film does unfortunately but it hardly detracts from the overall package, just tarnishes it a bit.

One of the strongest aspects of this show is how they approach the matter that Scott is a child of two worlds; he isn't treated like the second coming of Christ, he isn't destined to save the world or mankind from an ancient evil that serves as a contrast as the never ending battle of ""good vs. evil"". Scott is just different, but it's never treated as overwhelming negative --- outside of anyone besides Fox --- or a super positive born out of the superhero mentality. He's as unique as any of kid is considered to be by his peers or family, only his uniqueness his more apparent because there wouldn't be a story without it.

Performances in the series range from great to shaky; Robert Hayes isn't too ridiculous as the mildly human-educated Starman. He or the show don't play up his unfamiliarity with our world to an absurd extreme and he adds his own spin to the character that, along with the episode length, allows the personality to grow outside of its awkwardness on a believable level. The only time I think he fails is when he attempts to mimic Jeff Bridges performance in the recreation of the ""I gave you a baby"" scene; he`s so awful that it rather makes you appreciate Bridges' performance as an awkward alien all the more. Christopher Daniel Barnes gives an otherwise alright performance as the budding Scott Hayden; he is arguably the weakest link in regards to acting. He isn't horrible, just amusingly awkward a lot of the time. He does get better as the show goes on, but it's hard not laugh at some of the ways he delivers his dialog or worse, how he reacts to things (it`s an 80s' thing, I guess?). Working to his advantage is the fact that the writers don't demote Scott to a walking caricature of a teenager. He has his moments of poor judgment, angst and rebellion, but he is an otherwise level headed and quick-witted young man who acts more like the parent than his actual ""father"" does, which speaks to his troubled background, their situation. The fact that Starman isn't terribly versed in how to blend in with society gives him little choice in the matter but to be the adult in the relationship sometimes.

Of all the performances or characters I didn't care for, it was Michael Cavanaugh as George Fox. He's another one of those elements in the series that's merely ""necessary"" but not really welcome. Sure he's fun to shake your fist at whenever he pops up, but he's an intrusion that's meant to break up the monotony of Scott and Starman's complacency in the towns they visit until they do something to trip their cover. The show tries to inject personality, substance and purpose into Fox, but it all just comes off as flat. I don't care for this Fox character's medical problems, the lack of a life outside of chasing aliens at all. To top it all off, I truly lose any respect for him for the simple matter that his character introduction (""I'll bring you the alien--- the creature, the being, right to your table!"") comes off like a ringleader trying to mystify the otherwise ignorant audience. By time the finale(s) arrived, I wanted this character dead and gone.

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buck-Rogers/dp/B0002MHDW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buck Rogers</a>"" actress Erin Gray's brief stint as Jenny Hayden was an alright performance. She doesn't match Karen Allen's performance by a mile, but seeing as the character is in a reasonably different place (mentally and emotionally), I suppose that was the point. She isn't horrible, but some of the decisions made by the writers for the character hinder her performance. The romance --- despite who ""Paul Forrester"" really is --- is the crippling blow for me in all honesty and the character is sadly never given the chance to recover from it.

Overall, I truly enjoyed ""Starman"". Though it stumbles in a lot aspects execution-wise, I think it's a worthy successor to Carpenter's film and builds on the world created within the film's boundaries quite nicely. I'm simply disappointed by how they chose to deal with the reunion with Jenny (there were so many other and better ways to writing that episode that the hindsight burns like iodine in the wound). It's a real adventure that conveys themes of love and family bonds without being extremely patronizing, preachy or heavy handed about it. The show treats its audience with respect which is something I find is rather rare in television shows with any kind of aspect dealing with family and life lessons. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good obscure series to watch in your spare time. There's no real need to watch the film (though it does enhance the experience) and can you get into it quite easily. [a 4 out of 5]",1347580800,,13937,4.977243452125376

5084904,4,B007G8SEF2,"I was under the impression that the Starman series never made it to DVD status until about a month (07/2012) ago. The last I had read some months before was that Michael Cavanaugh, who plays George Fox in the series, was working to make the DVD happen. So I was mighty pleased when I discovered that it did become a reality.
 I was in my early twenties when the Starman series aired, and my love for good science fiction was at its peak. But this series added a spin that I was learning to appreciate at the time: a focus on relationships. The interplay between father and son, and the two plus the different characters in each episode, I grew to love watching. Even the ""villain"" (Cavanaugh) soon became more interesting.
 I would have liked this DVD to have closed captioning available, but the quality of the recording is as good as when aired, if not better.",1346457600,,862,4.484076433121019

5084906,4,B007G8SEF2,"I never got to see much of this one when I was in high school.  My friends kept physically dragging me out of the house those nights -- and while one would assume that to be a Friday night, I remember it being Thursday for some reason.  I was way more popular than I really needed to be.  Anyway, I'm finally getting a chance to see the show I was occassionally reading about in Starlog Magazine, and I'm thrilled with it.  As simple as it is, it's very charming and entertaining.  And I actually like it a lot more than John Carpenter's original film. (*whispers* Don't tell Carp)  As for this package ... it's actually well put together for what it is.  As many have said, pay particular attention to the fact that these are DVD-R's.  That's right, they burn off a batch, sell it, then adjust their inventory burn rate based upon consumer demand.  But it's okay, because while the quality isn't High-Def, you're not likely to get a High-Def restoration for a show that didn't do very well, anyway.  It only lasted one season, and limped through at that.  Wasn't very popular.  I said my friends physically pulled me away, that's because no one was watching it and they knew that.  And this DVD-R thing is a wonderful compromise for both the public and the studio.  The discs are purple underneath and will NOT play in SOME computers.  (Though mine plays fine in this:  http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SE-506AB-TSBD-External-Blu-ray/dp/B006B7R9QE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1344373132&sr=8-1&keywords=samsung+external+blu-ray+player

There are no special features and the episodes are not listed on the discs, only in the menu.  Using imdb.com might help you there.  Is thirty bucks too high for something like this ?  Good question.  Think of it this way, if it's a show you really want and need to watch, then it shouldn't be an issue.  If you're just addicted to pouring your disposable income into Amazon.com, you might want to think twice.

Spoiler alert:

Starman is called back by his son who barely survived a car crash with his foster parents.  Jenny Hayden had to give him up when he was 3 because the government kept following her.  Starman who assumes the identity of Photographer Paul Foster, and his son Scott Hayden join in a search for Jenny Hayden and have many adventures along the way.

5084920,5,B007G8SEF2,"The 1986 Starman TV series was a wonderful sequel to the 1984 John Carpenter movie of the same name.  I had remembered watching this series back when it first aired, and re-watching it on DVD this past weekend brought back some wonderful memories.  I was amazed how many scenes and lines from the show had actually stuck in my mind from 25 years ago, including many I hadn't even realised came from this show.

Robert Hays did an excellent job as both the title character and the original man whose appearance he took on, Paul Forrester; while he couldn't match Jeff Bridges performance from the film, he still took the role and made it his own through 22 episodes and did a wonderful job of it.  Michael Cavanaugh was a great choice to succeed Richard Jaeckel in the role of George Fox, the government agent who was pursuing Forrester.  CB Barnes was also a good choice for Starman's and Jenny Hayden's son.  And while Erin Gray certainly isn't Karen Allen, I thought she brought a nice quality to the role for the 2 episodes she appeared in the role of Jenny Hayden.

The DVDs themselves were excellent quality for a 25-26-year-old TV series on burned discs (through Amazon's MOD program).  The picture quality dropped in a few places, but overall was excellent and the sound quality remained constant throughout.  A previous reviewer commented on how the discs themselves do not have the episode titles printed on them, and while this is true, it's hardly a negative point in light of the quality of the episodes themselves.  The menu structure is also quite generic: a generic background with options to Play All episodes on the disc or individually, with the selectable list of episodes on the disc being presented below the Play All button.  I suspect that both the generic DVD menu and generic disc labels were done in an effort to keep the cost down for Amazon's MOD.

Overall an excellent purchase and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed both the film and the series.",1340582400,,1977,4.682080924855492
5084921,5,B007G8SEF2,"My copy of ""Starman"" just came in the mail today, and my husband and I have been watching them and enjoying the episodes, chuckling throughout at the witty humorous situations created by Starman's innocence and honesty. I can't believe this show was cancelled after only one season, yet though no fault of its own - they kept changing its time slot, and placed it up against shows like ""Dallas"" and ""The Cosby Show"". This series stood out as a wonderful example of a good, clean family show with great production values - something that just isn't seen anymore - without being too cheesy. There are really only 3 shows of the 80's that stand out in my mind as being wonderful and memorable - ""The Greatest American Hero"", ""Knight Rider"", and ""Starman"". Starman was the last series I enjoyed before I left for the Army in 1987. I didn't come to appreciate any other series until 1998, when I became a late-bloomer fan of ""The X-files"". Since X-files, I have been unable to really enjoy any other series. So Starman stands out in my memory as one of the best series I've ever seen. I was so happy to learn that it was being offered on DVD through Amazon! The only recordings I had of the show before were one VHS copy I recorded in 1986 (the Pilot), complete with 1986 commercials! (I can tell you those were entertaining to watch!) and I also recorded the whole series on VHS in 1994 when it was shown on the SciFi Channel. But now it's 2012 - absolutely no reason to keep the old VHS tapes anymore. Few people even have VCRs anymore, and everything you used to have on VHS can now be found on DVD. Time to update my collection and toss out the old VHS tapes! Thank you, Amazon, for helping me to join the 21st century, and converting my favorite shows to DVD!",1339372800,,1759,4.415384615384616

I had never seen SECRETS,  GRIFTERS,  or  THE TEST.  And believe me,  I was right in front of the tv waiting with my vcr powered up.  So it was great to finally see these episodes.

It's hard to pick a favorite episode since they were all done so well.  I liked ""Dusty""  But it did seem to be a bit of a copy from Secrets.  The casting on GRIFTERS was excellent.

5084943,5,B007G8SEF2,"Starman is a gem of a TV show that was largely missed when originally aired, and later became a fan favorite with reruns on The Scifi Channel generating legions of fans who declare it one of their top ten shows of all time. Many say the TV series, a sequel to the movie (which had earned Jeff Bridges his first Oscar nomination), was even better than the movie. It managed to turn a chase for an alien into a show with strong family values between father and son (almost an oxymoron these days), a show where each learns from the other, with a theme about helping people to better lives along the way, in locales from Seattle to Sedona. Order and enjoy with your family.

And for more ""episodes"", check out the Starman fan fiction on Archive of Our Own dot org.

From the Starman fan club: ""The 1986-87 television season saw something remarkable -- an hour-long drama suitable for family viewing. The show was STARMAN. Most people never saw it.""

""A few of the properties that make STARMAN an outstanding series are:

* Fine writing, directing, acting, production values.
* Strong-but-gentle male role models.
* A warm father-son relationship; level-headed, respectful parenting.
* Peaceful problem-solving through honest communication.
* Non-sexist, non-racist, non-ageist attitudes.
* Treatments of numerous social and environmental issues.
* A minimum of violence, car chases, explosions, even with suspense scenes aplenty.""

Update on quality of the discs: I've just received my disc set and can say the picture and sound quality are outstanding. If you're a long time fan and viewed this series on other media going all the way back to 25 year-old VHS tapes, you'll be amazed at the clarity. You will pick up items in the background you probably never noticed before, even if you watched the original airings on circa 1980's TV sets. On my 50"" plasma TV, color saturation in general is just a bit strong, making the scenes slightly lush, something like ""Hawaii 5-0."" I liked the effect except for the red van in ""The Return."" On computers, color saturation is normal.

One disappointment: Back when The Beatles produced their ""White Cover"" album, it was cool, avant-garde, even mysterious. Today, when I opened the DVD case, the same approach came across as a cheap, bootleg copy of some show ripped off in China. There are no graphics whatsoever, no mention of what that particular disk contains, only ""Starman - The Complete Series Disk 1,"" etc. on a stark, white background. Maybe because it's manufacture on demand, rather than a full production run, costs were cut. Burn on demand or not, since Sony/Amazon has to affix a label onto each disk anyway, why didn't they invest in some artwork, or minimally, a list of the episodes on each disk? Now you have to remember whether episode 5 is on disk 1 or 2 for instance. They were so close to a really class product, and they chintz on a minor item like a disk label. Really thought they had more marketing acumen than that. Maybe someone at Sony will get the feedback and easily fix it. There's also no printed information - only those two gaping plastic hooks where most DVD's hold something. My advice, print out the episode guide another reviewer thoughtfully included in their review, and avoid having to view the naked left side of the DVD case! There are other, even more detailed episode guides on the web.

Don't let that surface blemish prevent you from ordering though. This high quality TV series is a must have for families everywhere.",1332892800,48,3504,4.810631229235881
5084944,5,B007G8SEF2,"Slowly, but surely my list of TV Shows and Movies that I feel MUST be released on DVD continues to shrink. Here is one of those in Starman. Only lasting one season, I kind of discovered this show in mid-run. I seem to remember ABC showing it on Friday nights, and then moving it to what I call the ""death knell"" slot: Saturday nights! I don't remember which night it debuted on, as I previously mentioned discovering it kind of in mid-run. Anyway, enough of that! It's time to celebrate, because someone is FINALLY stepping up (in this case Sony studios MOD) and releasing another gem onto home video. And make no mistake: this short-lived TV Show is a true gem indeed! Robert Hays (""Angie"", ""The Girl, The Gold Watch, And Everything"") and the entire cast is wonderful (I still get a kick out of seeing George Fox (Michael Cavanaugh yelling ""I CAN BRING YOU THE ALIEN--THE BEING...!"" arms stretched forward in the title opening, LOL...).

Yes, it's time to celebrate...! Starman will be here this April, and I will be there to buy my copy! Now if only someone can negotiate the rights to get the old Batman TV series released!

UPDATED, 4/24/12:

I just received my copy of Starman, and am very happy with the transfers. They look and sound about as good as you can get considering the fact that it was produced in the mid-eighties. I wish Sony would've thought to put in an extra or two like perhaps an episode guide or booklet of some sort, but hey, beggars can't be choosers, and I've been begging for this one for a while :)
If you have fond memories of this series like I do, then you NEED to add this one to your collection, and if haven't yet seen this series, I would highly recommend it! It is a wonderful family oriented drama that everyone can enjoy, and the father/son interaction is very well played out. I plan on watching this one with my own son (and daughter too) once they are old enough. All I can say is THANK YOU SONY for finally getting this gem out to the public.",1332720000,8,1986,4.420765027322404
5084945,5,B007G8SEF2,"You know, there's a pretty short list of big-screen movies that have spawned successful t.v. series.  Off the top of my head, there's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, M*A*S*H, STARGATE SG-1, and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  And while calling this short-lived small-screen continuation of STARMAN ""successful"" might be stretching it a bit, I definitely feel the show outdid the movie in most every way.

The basic, Fugitive-style plot, of course, was nothing groundbreaking.  But where Starman shines is in the casting.  It may be hard at first to put aside one's memories of Jeff Bridges--he did, after all, receive an Oscar nomination for his role in the feature film--but Robert Hayes quickly makes it his own.  It helps that his alien character actually takes on a DIFFERENT body than the one in the film, so hopefully he is easier for audiences to accept.  Alien ""fish out of water"" stories were also nothing new, even in 1986.  But again, Hayes is up the challenge.  His Paul Forrester may be an innocent in a cynical world, but his message of peace and understanding is universal.

Likewise, the producers struck gold with C.B. (later Christopher Daniel, and no, that doesn't really make sense to me either) Barnes as the teenage offspring of Forrester and the human Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen in the film and Erin Gray capably filling her shoes here).  While Forrester feels a need to protect and teach his son, the boy also does both for him.

And then there's Michael Cavanaugh as George Fox, a man who is Jack McGee to Forrester's Incredible Hulk.  Fox is determined to capture this man from the stars, as well as his half-human progeny (""Children are the hope of your species, not the danger,"" Forrester tells an unsympathetic Fox).

What impresses me most about the show, even 25 years later, is how positive it is without becoming too preachy.  This ""Starman"" is something of a pacifist, solving problems with his mind rather than threats of violence.  It also is one of the few shows I can recall that presented such a strong father/son relationship (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine also handled this concept well. . .but I can't really think of any other examples).  Kids from broken homes weren't anything new in 1986, but just imagine how Scott would probably be portrayed in a modern series. . .angry and antisocial, and would probably spend more time teaching his estranged father how to hack a website than learning life lessons.

Aside from the fashions, cars, etc. I don't find the show dated at all.  I wish there were more shows like this, instead of so-called ""reality"" series and unimaginative and violent crime dramas.  I hope everyone who has fond memories of Starman: The Series, or just anyone seeking decent family entertainment will pick this one up.

On a technical note: Be aware that Sony is offering the show in the DVD-R format, meaning it's possible some older (or cheaper) DVD players will have problems with playback.  I play everything on a Blu-ray player, and can't imagine watching a show on my computer. . .but that's just me :-)",1332115200,38,3053,4.81957773512476
5084946,5,B007G8SEF2,"My new best bud, Fred, tells me I gave away too much in this review. I disagree, but admit that if he feels that way, others might as well.  So I have removed a few small tidbits and here is my warning: Some of the info I give here you will not know when you start the series, but I felt it important to mention them to give you a good idea of the tone and direction of the series. Therefore, this wordy paragraph is a ROUNDABOUT SPOILER ALERT, just in case you are concerned about knowing too much too soon...

The STARMAN tv series is a wonderful addition to the mythos of the movie. They understandably had to change a few details (the power spheres are reusable; the ""alien"" can stay on Earth indefinitely; new powers are present). I have no objection to the changes. I think they add to the depth of the story.

Robert Hayes (always fun to watch) portrays the alien in the persona of Paul Forrester, who is the Earth man our friendly alien clones. Starman then tries to take over Paul Forrester's life (within minutes of his accidental death) at the snowy mouth of a soon-to-be-active volcano. He is the same kind and naive alien as in the movie, but soon begins to learn and adjust.

C.D. Barnes - also known as C.B. Barnes or Christopher Daniel Barnes in various tv shows and movies - is Scott Hayden, son of the Starman and the inimitable Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen in the movie, Erin Gray in the series.) Scott is well-payed by Chris. He is intelligent, independent and has a great sense of humor.

While embarking on a search for his long-lost (14 years) son, Starman immediately gets into trouble due to the unprincipled nature of the man whose life he has assumed. He very slowly begins the arduous process of showing people who knew Paul Forrester (or his reputation) that he is not who he used to be.

It doesn't take long for him to find his son (Pilot). Once Scott Hayden is convinced that the Starman is really his father, they agree to begin their long search for Jenny Hayden.

Jennyhayden is not so easy to find.

The adventures of father and son involve not only a constant search for clues as to her whereabouts, but also profound lessons to those they meet along the way about such things as love, patience, kindness, honesty and simple truth.

MAJOR SPOILER: The best of all these episodes was the two-parter near the end of the series in which they locate Jenny Hayden (Erin Gray - who is wonderful!), who has become an artist of minor note, but who is well protected by her gallery dealer. Will they find her? If so, what will the reunion be like? Watch and see!  *****SPOILER OVER*****

Please check into this amazingly touching, intriguing and suspenseful show.  You will be glad you did.

I am sorry it took me so long to add this last paragraph. I was re-watching my own VHS copies until the DVDs actually came out.  I'm not sure why anyone thought I had purchased it illegally. I didn't. Now I have re-watched them again on DVD. The quality is as good as it can be when you take a filmed TV show from the 80s and transfer it to DVD without any enhancement.

In short, I am very happy with the DVDs I purchased from Amazon.  Feel free to acquire your own copy, it is well worth the price!",1331683200,6,3217,4.399662731871838
