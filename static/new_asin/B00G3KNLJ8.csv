***Spoiler Alert***

Three best friends, Meet (Vivek Oberoi), Prem (Aftab Shivdasani) & Amar (Ritesh Deshmukh), are about to finish college. Their friend, Hardik hits on a girl student and the new Principal, Robert witnesses this and ties Hardik to a tree - upside down & pulls his pants down - everyone is made to believe that the axe in Principal Robert's hand, is meant to castrate any boy who touches, speaks to or even looks at the girl students.

6 years later...

Amar is married to Mamta and they have a son named Papoo. Amar is upset that Papoo gets all of Mamta's attention while he is suffering (as a husband) without her. He even dreams of throwing her and Papoo down a well but that doesn't end well for him - somehow he still ends up with her and Papoo.

Meet is married to Unatti but he thinks that she is having an affair with their boss - he pours cement into the new BMW parked in their boss' yard - little does he know that the boss bought the car as a present for his wife. Unatti vows to hurt the person who did that to her new ride.

Prem is married to Thulsi. He stops a robbery at the bank that he is working at (I almost fell off my seat when an old man tells the robber that his wife knows his face and the robber shoots her - that was brilliant!). Prem wants to spend some alone time with Mamta but she is constantly helping out the family (cooking, cleaning, etc). When they are alone, Prem strips down to nothing but their cat ""Pu$$y"" bites his jewels - the cat is the one in the hospital (hahaha).

Meet, Amar & Prem get an invitation from their college for a reunion - their wives have excuses not to go so the three of them go together. The college is different - girls don't show off their bodies - all thanks to Principal Robert. Prem hooks up with Rose Mam (Principal Robert's wife), Meet meets Marlow (Principal Robert's sister) and Amar meets Mary (Principal Robert's daughter). They don't even get to have affairs with them because Principal Robert returns two days early from his errand.

You have to watch the rest because I don't want to give too much away. I laughed until my cheeks were taut and my tummy hurt - this is worth the time and money!",1479686400,,2334,4.312785388127854
