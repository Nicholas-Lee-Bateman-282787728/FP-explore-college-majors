Overall: This is looking to be an amazing DVD set on the Macho Man! 2014 may be WWE's best year so far in terms of DVDs. Unlike his first DVD set, The Randy Savage Story gives viewers a full disc documentary on the Macho Man's life and career with various wrestlers and talents, past and present, giving their opinions, thoughts, and favorite Randy Savage moments. One thing that's unique about this 3 disc/2 disc set is how this features less of Savage's televised matches and more of his untelevised matches from MSG and various live events. Fans will witness some of the Macho Man's greatest matches against greats such as Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibiase, Rowdy Roddy Piper, and others. If you want to see some of Savage's more famous televised matches, I recommend buying the Randy Savage Ultimate Collection. The Randy Savage Story is a top-notch must-buy for any fans of the Macho Man who want to relive the glory days of 80s and 90s wrestling",1410998400,21,3757,4.821316614420063

6600057,4,B00MQVSEZE,"One of the greatest characters in WWE history was the Macho Man Randy Savage. First disc is an excellent documentary on the Macho Man. Growing up playing and enjoying all sports but especially Baseball in which he was very good at. His father was a wrestler and when Baseball didn't work out he turned to wrestling with his brother. Very interesting to hear not only from his fellow wrestlers but also from Lenny Poffo (his brother) and his mother. Shows a different side to the wrestler we know and how protective he was of Elizabeth to the point of paranoia, his reasons for leaving WWE and starting again in WCW. Also touches on the breakdown in his relationship with Elizabeth, her death and ultimately Randy's tragic car crash. There are many promo's and vignettes to be seen in disc 1 something that was missing in the lead up to any of the matches shown on discs 2 & 3 which I was somewhat disappointed in. The matches shown were here were good to very good but not his best matches, they were from the previous DVD put out on The Macho Man, although his match with DDP on this set was a classic  All in all I found this a very good purchase as I am one of the many millions of fans of the Macho Man. If the documentary had been included with the original DVD on Macho Man then I would've given this a 5 rating.",1437696000,,1318,4.314516129032258
6600058,4,B00MQVSEZE,"Randy Macho Man Savage is one of the few wrestlers to achieve true mainstream immorality. Just mention his name to anyone and theyll say Ooooooooh Yeah! or Snap into a Slim Jim. He was the kind of person who left an indelible memory on you whether you were a fan of wrestling or not. Now, wrestling fans have the chance to look at the fabled life of one of professional wrestlings greatest in the new video release Macho Man: The Randy Savage Story.
In 2009, WWE Video released a three disc DVD set that covered many of his memorable matches in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). However the product was solely lacking in that it didn't have a documentary on this WWE Superstars fabled career. Wrestling fans have known that theres been bad blood between Savage and the WWE ever since his abrupt departure from the company in 1994 so it came as little surprise for the DVDs lack of a documentary.
Sadly, the Macho Man was taken from us in May of 2011 when he suffered a heart attack and crashed his Jeep into a tree. The wrestling world was stunned by the loss of one of the all-time greats. Although Savage had not wrestled since an appearance in Total Nonstop Action (TNA) at their Turning Point PPV in 2004, he had by no means faded from the fans memories.
In 2014, the WWE released Macho Man: The Randy Savage Story, a two disc Blu Ray that included a documentary retrospective on Savages career as well as a collection of matches not seen on his last home video. The ninety three minute documentary includes comments from Savages fellow wrestlers as well as friends and family members. It explores Savages intense dedication to excellence as well as his relationships outside of the ring.
The feature explores Randys life from his time as an athlete in school where he was an all-around athlete but excelled at baseball to his stint as a professional baseball player to his career in the ring. Listening to Randys friends, family, and fellow athletes, its clear that he was passionate about whatever he set his sights on. When he played baseball, he lived and breathed the game. When a shoulder injury saw his release from a minor league team, he destroyed his baseball bats and sought out a career in the squared circle, following in his father Angelo Poffos footsteps (The documentary notes how Savage dabbled in professional wrestling during his baseball career, wrestling under a mask as The Spider).
While the video gives a decent overview of Savages career, the documentary is as just as much about the man as the wrestler. Apparently the producer felt that fans are so familiar with The Macho Mans body of work (which is included here and on his last release) that it doesnt need to be covered in the documentary. Granted, key moments like his match with Ricky Steamboat, his WWF title win at Wrestlemania IV, and subsequent feud with Hulk Hogan are covered but the presentation glosses over some other memorable programs including his feud with the Ultimate Warrior, his battle with Nature Boy Ric Flair, his feud with Jake The Snake Roberts, and most of his time in WCW (although there is a nice discussion of how Randy Savage saw potential in wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and helped put him over in a WCW feud).
There are a wide variety of people who speak about The Macho Man. Wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Pat Patterson, Jerry Lawler, Bret Hart, Ted DiBiase, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, Dolph Ziggler, Sheamus, Lex Lugar, and of course, Ricky Steamboat. Manager Jimmy Hart (who worked with Savage in Memphis and helped him get in to the WWF) and longtime announcer Mean Gene Okerlund discuss some anecdotes about Savage. Randys mother and his brother Lanny (who wrestled as Leaping Lanny Poffo and The Genius in the WWF) discuss their relatives life, adding another dimension to our understanding of Randy Savage. Lanny Poffo is extremely defensive of his brother (as family members often are) but he adds a lot to the documentary. Conspicuous by their absence are Vince McMahon, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels. Much was said about Savage and McMahons friendship and subsequent falling out but it would have been helpful to hear from McMahon. Triple H had harsh words for Savage at the start of the new millennium so it would have been fascinating to hear if he felt the same today. As for Michaels, Savage wisely saw Michaels potential and some comments from Michaels on Savages legacy would have been insightful. The documentary really covers some interesting ground. We even hear from the gentleman who made The Macho Mans many colorful outfits. He makes a good point when he says that although Savage was not a small man, he looked smaller compared to some of the other wrestlers. This problem was taken care of by the amazing outfits which Randy Savage wore (and which were constantly being updated to keep his look fresh).
We learn a lot about The Macho Mans career including how he got his nickname The Macho Man, the last name Savage, and of course, his trademark Oooooooooooh Yeah! (The answers are surprising). Lanny Poffo even discusses how nervous his brother was at giving promos and that Savage felt Lanny was much better at promos. One particular thing that I found interesting was confirmation of a long-standing rumor that Savage was meticulous about crafting his matches. While most wrestlers call the majority of their match in the ring, wrestlers such as Ricky Steamboat confirmed that Savage carefully planned his matches before getting into the ring. Steamboat claims that Savage broke down their legendary Wrestlemania III bout into several pages, documenting every move.
The video discussed Savages relationships outside of the ring. Savage was close to WWF kingpin Vince McMahon but that did not stop McMahon from putting Savage out to pasture before Savage felt it was time to hang up his tights. One thing I have never understood is why the WWF chose not to use Savage in the ring during its New Generation era. While the company was obviously pushing a younger generation of stars, Savage was ready and willing to use his star power to put over young talent. Case in point a program in wanted to work with Shawn Michaels. The program was nixed by Vince McMahon (who wanted Savage to stay behind the camera as a color commentator).  This was definitely a blunder on McMahons part. Another blunder were the personal attacks that McMahon made against Savage in his Nacho Man and Huckster skits where the WWF mocked Savage and Hogan as being in WCW because they were too old to compete in the WWF. The attacks on Savage hit close to home when they mocked his age, his bald spot, and most of all, his relationship with Elizabeth, revisiting the unproven rumors that Elizabeth had had an affair with the Hulkster.
Machos relationship with Hogan is portrayed as a classic love/hate relationship. While Savage was a phenomenal athlete and wrestler, the comparisons between him and Hogan had to eat at his delicate ego. However their work in the ring generated numerous great encounters including their fabled program as the Mega Powers and the subsequent The Mega Powers Explode angle that culminated in the main event at Wrestlemania V (Given Savages fantastic performances at Wrestlemania including his show-stealing match with Wrestlemania III against Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, CM Punk feels Savage is the true Mr. Wrestlemania).  Hogan notes that he and Macho Man reconciled shortly before Savages death which is kind of disturbing because Hogan also claims to have reconciled with the Ultimate Warrior before the Warriors death. Also disturbing is Hogans story that he and Savage had the same doctor. Savages doctor reportedly told Hogan that he asked Savage to get an EKG after he learned Randys mother had a heart problem but Randy put it off to care for his mother. Hogan claims that the doctor told him that had Savage had the EKG, his heart attack might have been prevented.
And of course no feature on The Macho Man would be complete without a look at his relationship with Miss Elizabeth. The video discusses how Vince McMahon toyed with the idea of bringing in Missy Hyatt to manage Savage. Savage suggested that his wife Elizabeth be given a screen test and the rest was history. Savage was one of those wrestlers who didn't need a manager but the Liz/Savage relationship took things to the next level. The idea of a truly brutal heel having a lovely and innocent woman at his side drove the fans crazy. As the video suggests, fans had to wonder what Elizabeth saw in Macho Man, hinting that there might be a good side to him.  Behind the scenes, you hear from a slew of wrestlers who discuss how over-protective Randy Savage was of his wife. While Savages brother Lanny Poffo disputes these claims, it seems pretty clear that Savage was jealous of anyone getting close to her. Hulk Hogan recalls the famous Mega Powers Explode angle and Savage taking exception with Hogan over how close he was touching Elizabeth while she lay on a gurney after a kayfabe injury. Another anecdote is that when Savage went away for a week, he bought Elizabeth TV dinners for every meal so that she wouldnt have to leave the house.
While many fans would consider Elizabeth to be the love of Savages life, his friends and family talk of how The Macho Man reunited with his high school sweetheart late in life, marrying her and spending his remaining days with her. Savage is described as very happy during this time and that he had finally found his soul mate. Unfortunately he did not have much time to spend with her due to his unexpected death.
The video does leave some items out whether its his work in or out of the ring. While it does mention The Macho Mans highly successful time as a pitchman for Slim Jim (sales reportedly doubled when Savage appeared in their commercials), it doesnt mention his TV and film career including his memorable role in Spider-Man.  As mentioned earlier, the documentary didn't include some of Savages major feuds and thats a shame because all of them were very memorable. It boggles the mind why WWE Video doesnt go the extra mile and add fifteen or twenty minutes to a video feature.
Like most WWE videos, you really need to get the Blu-Ray because of the extras. While there aren't a ton of bonus matches, the ones that are on there are worth checking out, especially the Lumberjack Match between Savage and Hogan at Madison Square Garden (the blow-off to their series in 1986) as well as several additional anecdotes about The Macho Man. Its hard to remember a bad match so anything on here is worth checking out. Unlike the Ultimate Warrior releases, there really aren't any jobber matches.
Whether you're a fan of The Macho Man or not, this video is really worth checking out because there are very few wrestlers of his caliber. Savage is the kind of wrestler who will entertain fans of any generation both in the ring and out of the ring. His life story is fascinating as well so this video is worth getting for both the documentary and the matches. While many of The Macho Mans high profile matches were included on his last video, theres lots to enjoy on this one as well.",1436140800,13,11209,4.758478931140802

6600080,4,B00MQVSEZE,"Randy Savage is my favorite wrestler o all time, so hearing about this DVD I was cautiously optimistic. After watching the first 40 minutes or so, I realized I was going o be greatly disappointed. While their is a lot of positive stuff said about Randy, you find it is from the same 2-3 people, Lanny, his mom and Bret Hart. Almost everyone else on this set, takes their pot shots at Randy, namely one Hulk Hogan. It was nothing I haven't heard before as far as Randy's over protective nature of Elizabeth, however I don't feel like they needed to spend a lot of the time on the fall of their marriage. I also feel like it was unfair as neither Randy or Liz can give their side of the story. Another thing that bothered me was Hogan saying how crazy Savage was yet not really giving any real specifics on Randy's actions, he just kept saying ""craziness"" or ""Madness"" Also nobody from the McMahon family appears at all on this set, I assume it's due to the rumors about Macho and Stephanie. I d want to point out that Vince and Stephanie talk about Randy on the WrestleMania Rewind shows on the Network, so their absence on this set seems to be done on purpose. So that's how I felt about the DVD biography portion, it was okay but they don't mention his feud with Tito Santana, Jake Roberts or Ultimate Warrior, all of whom Randy did some of his best work with.

As for the matches, I didn't hate anything on here as Randy always had at least solid performances.

The first match with Steamboat is the match that set up the angle for WrestleMania III  T
he 2nd match with Ricky was a great match from Maple Leaf Gardens.
The lumberjack match with Bruno is an okay bout that sees more interaction between Randy and Steamboat on the road to WrestleMania.
vs. Harley Race was fun match that was a clashing of generations.
 6 man tag steel cage match with Macho teaming with Strike Force facing the hart Foundation and Honky Tonk Man. This was a fun match that was
 booked a bit oddly as the wrestlers looked pretty clueless at times. VS.
 Ted DiBiase, it's amazing to me these guys never had a 1 on 1 rematch on pay-per-view for the WWF title. This was a really good match that showcased both guys abilities to tell a story.
Harlem Street Fight vs. Bad News Brown This was a quick match but way ahead of it's time as far as utilizing hardcore wrestling elements.
VS.Hulk Hogan Despite my animosity towards Hogan due to his personal conduct away from the business him and Savage always had amazing chemistry and their characters were custom made for each other. Having said that, if you've seen one Hogan/Savage match you've seen them all. It was more of the same here.
VS. Rowdy Roddy Piper This was an okay match with some entertaining antics between Piper and Sherri outside of that, this match was somewhat disappointing,
VS. Shawn Michaels This was a very good match showing again Savage's ability to tell a story.
VS. Ultimate Warrior Randy always brought out the best in the Warrior and this classic from Summer Slam 1992 was no different, these two had a very good match that was marred by interference in the 2nd half
VS. Ric Flair All I can say is that if you've seen one Ric Flair match you've seen them all.
VS. Arn Anderson This was a very good match for the WCW Television Title. These two guys went at it non stop in a physical war. A nice mix of Savage's intensity and Arn's cold and methodical approach.
VS. Ric Flair Savage inside a steel cage. While it was a typical Flair match this was really good stuff with a very similar storyline as their WWF rivalry from 4 years prior.
VS. DDP This was Savage's greatest rivalry in WCW as he helped elevate DDP to superstardom. All 3 matches in this feud were five star matches to me. It earned two guys in their 40's a feud of the year award and that says  lot in the young star hungry business of wrestling. This was a perfect way for their rivalry to end and was a fantastic match.

I would recommend this set if you are a Randy Savage fan. Randy was my favorite wrestler so I admit I might be a bit harsh towards the biography portion. The matches on this set are really good and really showcase Savage's immense talents whether it's bringing intensity or his amazing ability at telling a story with facial expressions, the matches here show you what made his character such a unique person fro it's time. I hope some day the Savage/Roberts and Savage/Warrior feuds will be covered in depth as specifically with Jake, it brought a whole new element to the then WWF that was very ""attitude era""  In closing this was a good DVD that spent a bit too much time being negative towards someone who wasn't able to give his side of the story and had some awesome wrestling!",1424822400,,4725,4.42183908045977

DO:
Watch if you are a WWE fan
Watch if you USED to be a WWF fan.
Watch if you were one of the millions that grew up watching Macho Man.
If you want to have a better understanding of what made him tick, and how he was behind the curtain.

DONT:
Watch if you are upset that it's not available on WWE NETWORK, and will complain about spending money on this and that etc etc
Watch if you didn't like him.
Expect to find out why he wasn't inducted in the hall of fame earlier
Expect to find out what went down behind the scenes between him and vince.",1421280000,,800,4.121794871794871
6600090,3,B00MQVSEZE,"Well this was disapointing.
This collection, whilst containing some great matches and rarities like the WWE Championship main event at SummerSlam92 in Wembley Stadium, London England, misses out a lot of classic matches which is quite strange.

There is no sign of the following-
-Macho Vs Steamboat at WMIII (WTF!)
-Any Mega Powers matches
-The career vs career match against the Warrior at WMVII
-The wedding ceremony with Miss Elizabeth is not included, only briefly mentioned in the doc
-Any Ultimate Maniacs matches
-Any matches from 1998-2001 when Randy combed his hair back and got all roided up...
-And not even one promo from Savage, himself one of the greatest on the mic in the history of the sport.

The Ultimate Warrior Blu ray had all his big matches and 5-6 promos...
It seems if the talent has a hand in creating the DVD it's decent, but if not (Macho, Goldberg) the end result is distinctly lacking.
Also worth noting is that the documentary included does not even explain the main character arcs Macho went through in his ring career.",1421280000,3,1052,4.838888888888889

It deals a lot with his early years, start in the business, and his relationship with Liz and his final wife.  Mentions his tumultuous relationship with Vince/WWE, Hogan, etc.  A lot of interviews with Lanny Poffo and I think it is meant to smooth things in preparation for a HOF induction.

I wanted to see more of a description of his career feud by feud moment by moment.  More interaction with Roberts, DiBiase, Hogan.  Mentions of Sensational Sherri, feuds with Warrior, Flair, Rhodes.... Where is Honky Tonk Man?  These feuds and magic moments were an important part of his career and I really feel it is missing.

I loved the fact that this delved a bit more into Macho Man's upbringing.  If you are a huge Macho Man fan, you may have heard of many of these stories before, however, it was nice to hear them told by those close to him (including his own Mother).  The matches are alright, but I question some of their choices.  I really wish the WWE would come out with something that holds more of the interviews that Macho Man did back when he was active.  He was a fantastic athlete, but WWE sort of misses the boat when they do not have more interviews that show his character (which was a HUGE part of his performances too).  I think the could have interviewed more of the people who wrestled back at the same time and less of the newer wrestlers of today.  And while Lanny is good for some insight, they almost relied way too much on him for this one.  All in all, it is always awesome to see Macho Man on video and this is one step up from the previous release WWE: Macho Madness - The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection.",1419120000,,1091,4.211538461538462

I purchased the DVD set that came out a few years ago and it had some great matches and documentary footage.  This new documentary along with the interviews from his family and friends and his own commentary made it interesting to watch.  The rest of the DVD was lacking in how it was packaged.  The matches they selected to present seemed to be random at best.  There was no added commentary to explain why these matches were chosen or how they were a representation of his history in the business.  Some of the WCW matches were difficult to watch.  They seemed to be more filler than highlights of his career.  Tony Shiavone's commentary barely addressed the match that was taking place. He seemed more interested in hyping Bret Hart's arrival or shilling the WCW product.  These in no way helped to promote the Macho Man.  Being one of my favorite wrestlers I enjoyed the retrospective look back at his early life but beyond the documentary this packaging was far from what I expected it to be.  Enjoy it for what its worth.  The previous DVD set was packaged much better but lacked in the documentary and interview department.,1417478400,,1251,4.631818181818182

6600126,5,B00MQVSEZE,"Having read some less than stellar reviews for this item I felt the need to write my first review on here. First off having been a major Macho Madness fan for all my life I was super excited for this set. I mean literally I do comedy sketches as Macho Man on Youtube if you don't believe me check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEOET5d5q-Q  OR  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVO2tT-A288&list=TL0xpBR8JnWVI . Anyway I was never fully satisfied with the original Macho Madness DVD WWE put out. It was nice to have a collection of matches but there was no real commentary from other wrestlers. Instead we had 2 newbie run of the month current wwe personalities introducing the story of the greatest wrestler of all time. After viewing this DVD I feel rewarded for the wait. It is not perfect but it is damn close. You get an entire biography through Machos life without too much focus on one topic. You get input from many of the greatest legends of the sport on how they felt about the Macho Man. There are a few newer personalities such as CM Punk which really surprised me due to him not being currently employed by WWE  but most of the wrestlers are the legends you want to hear from including Jake the Snake, Ricky Steamboat, Bret Hart, Dusty Rhodes, DDP etc. even Ric Flair and Hogan you know since they can't keep talking smack about Macho now that he has passed they have to actually say nice things otherwise look like the egomaniacs they've always been. Ofcourse Lanny is all throughout the video and even Randy's mother does commentary on points in his life. All and all if you are a macho maniac like i am and you can't go through a checkout aisle without snapping into a slim jim and elbow dropping the checkout clerk, then you will love every second of this video. As i watched the movie with my foam finger macho man on one hand, a slim jim and macho man action figure in the other, and a tray of some very Macho Nacho's at my side, I realized that it was one of the best Thanksgivings ever.

Macho Man: The Randy Savage Story
This was a documentary on this life & career with comments throughout the presentation from his brother Lanny Poffo, his mother Judy Poffo, Jerry Lawler, Pat Patterson, former Major League Baseball player Larry Herndon, Dusty Rhodes, Ric Flair, Jimmy Hart, Bret Hart, Dolph Ziggler, Jake Roberts, Ted Dibiase, Lex Luger, Sheamus, costume designer Michael Braun, Diamond Dallas Page, Gene Okerland, C.M. Punk, Ricky Steamboat, Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and other childhood friends of Savage along with archival interviews from Savage himself & his father Angelo Poffo.  The documentary begins talking about the background of his father Angelo Poffo including the world record he set for sit-ups & why he did that exact number before going into Savage's history of being a baseball player including an exercise he developed for bat strength that others started using as well along with how he symbolically ended his baseball career.  What Savage did to get around a certain clause in his baseball contract begins the discussion on the history of his wrestling career & the origins of his character developed from the names ""Macho Man"" & ""Savage"" to the trademark ""Oh Yeah!"" followed by talking about the territorial feud in Memphis between his family's promotion & the one ran by Jerry Lawler.  His entrance into WWE was discussed next as far as who were the people who signed off on him to Vince & who was originally scheduled to be his manager before going into his relationship with Elizabeth & other elements of the presentation that stood out from his detailed outfits & entrance to unique voice & interviews including behind the scenes footage of him perfecting his promos.  The behind the scenes story of the WrestleMania III match with Ricky Steamboat as far as the heavy pre-match preparation before going into him becoming the WWE Champion at WrestleMania IV & the face of the company leading into his match against Hogan at WrestleMania V as far as how real tensions between both men were worked into the storyline including how one time they just turned the camera on & started filming in the middle of a real verbal fight between the two.  One of the heavily discussed chapters happened next as far as Randy & Elizabeth's relationship both on & off screen as far as different views on if Randy was over protective of her & how important the SummerSlam 91 wedding was before going into details of their eventual breakup & why Hogan was accused of being involved in the situation along with different avenues Savage explored with his career outside of being a wrestler such as a commentator & ambassador for WWE along with Slim Jim followed discussing how he wanted to work with one specific superstar & how the response to it set lead to him leaving for WCW.  His WCW career was discussed next as far as what he felt he had to prove & the reaction he had to WWE's ""Huckster & Nacho Man"" characters along with how the love/hate relationship with Hogan effected other wrestlers before talking about the importance of his feud with Diamond Dallas Page & the purpose behind Team Madness.  Life after wrestling was discussed as far as why he never returned to WWE & the effect Elizabeth's death had on him along going into the heavy amount of charity work he did followed by the story of reuniting with his old girlfriend & how everyone saw he was happier with life than ever before going into the details his tragic death including what his final wishes were & closing out the presentation with everyone reflecting on his legacy.
Bonus matches include two Intercontinental Title defenses against Ricky Steamboat including the infamous match where he injured Steamboat's throat, Bruno Sammartino in a Lumberjack Match, Harley Race, Steel Cage Match with Strike Force vs. Hart Foundation & Honky Tonk Man, Ted Dibiase, Bad News Brown in a Harlem Street Fight, WWE Champion Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Shawn Michaels, Ultimate Warrior from SummerSlam 92, Ric Flair, WCW TV Champion Arn Anderson, Steel Cage Match vs. Ric Flair at WCW SuperBrawl VI, and a Death Match vs. DDP from Halloween Havoc 97.

Along with both DVD sets come an exclusive t-shirt, glasses, and bandana in a collectors box.  In the end, whatever wasn't covered on one set was talked about the other and you got a high majority of the important & quality matches throughout Savage's career combined here so this is the ultimate collection for any Randy Savage fan that I highly recommend.",1416960000,2,6000,4.954274353876739
6600128,4,B00MQVSEZE,"I said this in my review of his previous match anthology DVD that there's nothing I can put into words that hasn't already been said to justify the legendary ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage and with his passing in 2011 now comes a presentation about this life & career with comments throughout the presentation from his brother Lanny Poffo, his mother Judy Poffo, Jerry Lawler, Pat Patterson, former Major League Baseball player Larry Herndon, Dusty Rhodes, Ric Flair, Jimmy Hart, Bret Hart, Dolph Ziggler, Jake Roberts, Ted Dibiase, Lex Luger, Sheamus, costume designer Michael Braun, Diamond Dallas Page, Gene Okerland, C.M. Punk, Ricky Steamboat, Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and other childhood friends of Savage along with archival interviews from Savage himself & his father Angelo Poffo.

Normally I wait till the end of my review to give my summary but with this being a highly anticipated presentation along with the heavily mixed reviews already for this set, I'll give it now.  Positives for this set is that WWE continued the trend they've been doing for the past few years in reach out past their own ""universe"" to get more personal comments on the profiled superstar while also finding an interview with Savage covering personal subjects that I don't recall ever seeing before along with the match selection giving us more rarer matches from his career with a high majority not being previously released onto DVD or their network.  Some of the negatives here were that other's have already stated is that some of the details of Savage's career (feuds such as his with Flair over the WWE/WCW championships & time periods such as the ""Macho King"") were either completely glossed over or ignored in favor of telling a more personal story when there was enough significant time in the presentation to say more about these specific subjects & normally I don't nitpick at this sort of thing but I just didn't like for the opening image they used to start the presentation referencing his car accident while I would liked to see the match he actually won the title of ""King"" against Duggan instead of just some random defense of the crown.  In the end, I heavily enjoyed the presentation & admit that it was very emotional doing a great job of covering not just the character ""Randy Savage but the life of the man behind it in Randy Poffo so this is something I definitely would recommend to any fan of the ""Macho Man.""

One of the heavily discussed chapters happened next as far as Randy & Elizabeth's relationship both on & off screen as far as different views on if Randy was over protective of her & how important the SummerSlam 91 wedding was before going into details of their eventual breakup & why Hogan was accused of being involved in the situation along with different avenues Savage explored with his career outside of being a wrestler such as a commentator & ambassador for WWE along with Slim Jim followed discussing how he wanted to work with one specific superstar & how the response to it set lead to him leaving for WCW.  His WCW career was discussed next as far as what he felt he had to prove & the reaction he had to WWE's ""Huckster & Nacho Man"" characters along with how the love/hate relationship with Hogan effected other wrestlers before talking about the importance of his feud with Diamond Dallas Page & the purpose behind Team Madness.  Life after wrestling was discussed as far as why he never returned to WWE & the effect Elizabeth's death had on him along going into the heavy amount of charity work he did followed by the story of reuniting with his old girlfriend & how everyone saw he was happier with life than ever before going into the details his tragic death including what his final wishes were & closing out the presentation with everyone reflecting on his legacy.

Matches Include:
Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Ricky Steamboat - This match had a special stipulation of two referees as Steamboat was dominate early working over the arm with his trademark armdrag into an armbar while Savage maintained an aerial assault coming off the top rope with his various double ax handles & flying crossbody but this big story here was not only about the continued questionable tactics of a certain official but also how the action got so out of hand that one man wasn't the same for weeks after this match.
""Superstars"" Nov. 86

Intercontinental Championship/Lumberjack Match vs. Bruno Sammartino - Their previous encounter (on Savage's previous DVD set) got so out of hand with the other wrestlers involved trying to separate the two that this was their rematch a month later under this special lumberjack stipulation that started off with Savage trying to use a distraction to get the early advantage only for Bruno to come back strong causing Savage to keep going to the outside attempting to break the momentum only for the lumberjacks to toss him right back in causing Savage to resort to other measures to get the advantage including some lumberjacks getting more physically involved than just throwing Bruno back into the ring while another lumberjack was very desperate to get his hands on Savage himself.
""Boston Garden"" Feb. 87

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat started out more aggressively than he's usually known for going after Savage right away with chops & his trademark armdrag while doing a ground & pound when Savage was on the mat only for Savage to catch Steamboat heavily working him over on the floor taking advantage of the ringside environment while focusing on his previously injured throat & neck area with both men trading momentum with each man giving as much as the other received to the point where this match turned into a fight on the rampway with one man bleeding.
""Maple Leaf Gardens"" Feb. 87

vs. Harley Race - Savage was able to take the early advantage staying one step ahead of Race by either reversing his attempt at offense or beating Race at his own game showing that he wasn't a stranger to taking the match to the floor or using dirty tactics as Race was able to hit some impactful offense on Savage but this was overall a dominate performance by Savage.
Sept. 87

Steel Cage Match w/Strike Force vs. Honky Tonk Man & Hart Foundation - This match was held under the rules where your team won when all members escaped the cage as this started out exactly how you expected it with the tensions between all six competitors in that it was a brawl where you saw certain people just try to escape more to get away from their opponent than win the match while others used the cage to their advantage along with the scenarios happening of one member of a team leaving the cage making their team one step closer to winning the match but also giving a numbers advantage to their opponents still involved in the match as this was overall a fun match.
""Boston Garden"" Mar. 88

WWE Championship Match vs. Ted DiBiase - Savage came into this match wearing a neck brace from the recent attack by Andre The Giant with Savage coming to the ring so intense that he attacked Dibiase before taking off any of his entrance gear including the championship belt before Dibiase was able to focus on the neck by either stretching or delivering big blows directly to it while resorting to choking & as other dirty tactics such as Virgil on the outside in a competitive match that went back & forth between both men throughout the contest.
""Boston Garden"" July 88

WWE Championship/Street Fight Match vs. Bad News Brown - Both men came dressed ready to fight & that's exactly what happened right when both men where in the ring as they started brawling in & outside of the ring with a chair & weight belt being used in the opening moments as this just got more intense as time went on with one man being thrown into the front row while the referee was in the wrong place during one point in time during the match only to pay for it as this was just a fight which got so intense that it took more than just a victory for this fight to be stopped with anyone getting in their way paying the price.
Jan. 89

vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was their WrestleMania rematch with the change being that Savage was now the challenger but also had his new manager Sherri in his corner as Savage attempted to use illegal tactics to get the opening momentum against Hogan before he got caught showboating too often allowing Hogan to dominate only for Sherri to constantly make her presence known both visually & physically to keep Savage having control throughout the match in a match that didn't match the quality of their more famous encounters but definitely told a good story involving all three participants.
""Madison Square Garden"" Apr. 89

vs. Roddy Piper - I think this was the first television singles encounter between both men with Piper having some fun at Sherri's expense which Savage tried to take advantage of only for Piper to keep out wrestling & stay one step ahead of Savage including beating him at his own game taking the match into the isleway before Sherri's involvement allowed Savage to take advantage of the situation to regain control as they went back & forth including both men performing the same move on each other only for it to have a negative effect on themselves as well as the match turned into a fight that continued even after the bell.
Jan. 90

WWE Championship Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Savage was coming into this match with a bad leg from his WrestleMania match days earlier as Shawn kept targeting the leg right away only for Savage to keep fighting him off including sending Shawn into the post on the outside & delivering offense that not only hurt Shawn but his own leg which Shawn was able to eventually capitalize on heavily working it over in the ring with various stretches & strikes along with moves like the figure four along with whatever he could around ringside including the environment or Sherri resulting in a good match with great storytelling regarding Savage's knee.
Apr. 92

WWE Championship Match vs. Ultimate Warrior - The rematch from their famous WrestleMania VII encounter held under different circumstances with this not only now being for the WWE Championship but also Ric Flair's consultant Mr. Perfect proclaiming for weeks that one of these men had purchased his services for this match (which was heavily showcased in the pre-match footage).  Both men came into this match very intense from the handshake to just how they threw off the ring gear getting ready to go as they were even the early moments trading momentum with each having a counter or reversal to the other's offense before each man was able to hurt an area of the body on their opponent such as the lower back with hard whips into the corner & the neck with a piledriver as they just continued to beat each other into exhaustion with either both men catching each other with the same move or kicking out of the other's trademark offensive move to the point where the referee was in the wrong place at the wrong time more than once with the bigger story of the match being Mr. Perfect & Ric Flair revealing just exactly who's side they were on & what their true intentions were.  I try not to use the word ""classic"" too much when it comes to Ultimate Warrior matches but is his a lost classic in both men's careers because one of their greatest oppositions were each other as this was a quality match that always gets overshadowed by their encounter over a year earlier as it was very intense & never let up from start to finish.
SummerSlam 92
[Bonus Disc of ""Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior""]

WWE Championship Match vs. Ric Flair - Savage was heavily limping to the ring with his knee still hurting from the chair attack at SummerSlam with Flair in the ring & Mr. Perfect on the outside going after his leg heavily targeting it as Savage kept trying to fight both of them off including applying a specific move only for Flair to escape by beating on his knee constantly working it over & pushing the limits of the referee's count as Savage kept fighting back including beating on Flair on the outside & delivering offense that would end up hurting his own knee in the process resulting in a match that served it's purpose in telling the story of Flair & others having a game plan to heavily target his leg while Savage refused to go down without a fight.
""Prime Time Wrestling"" Sept. 92

vs. WCW Television Champion Arn Anderson - There was a special stipulation that the Television Championship would only be defended during the first 15 minutes of this match.  Savage started off very aggressive to the point where the referee had to keep separating him from Anderson as Savage kept going for the quick pins keeping a fast pace causing Anderson to keep going to the outside to break the momentum before a distraction allowed Anderson to use whatever tactics he could on the in & outside of the ring to slow down the pace while stopping Savage dead in his tracks whenever he started to build momentum as both men traded momentum throughout the match resulting in a quality contest.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Jan. 95

WCW Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Ric Flair - Savage came to ringside with Elizabeth while Flair had Woman in his corner as Flair kept stalling as Savage was right at the door waiting for Flair to come in as Flair was able to take control with his trademark offense of chops & knee drops plus focusing on the legs while also using the cage to his advantage various times along with resorting to tactics earning him the name ""The Dirtiest Player In The Game"" punishing Savage more than trying to win the match to the point where the referee got involved in the action more than once as Savage was able to catch Flair whenever he left an opening using the same tactics as Flair did such as using the cage as a weapon to the point where Flair was bleeding as both men continued to trade momentum throughout the match in what was an aggressive match between the two.
WCW Superbrawl VI 96

Death Match: Randy Savage vs. Dallas Page - After having an intense feud for over the past 6 months, their final encounter had to be held under rules where it didn't end until one man was the last man standing. DDP came in not wearing his ring gear but jeans & t-shirt with his ribs taped as both men started the brawl on the outside with Page choking Savage with his own shirt with Savage targeting Page's ribs with stomps & kicks while also hanging DDP on the ring ropes & both men being so intense that they knocked each other out with a double lariat at one point. DDP went outside of his usual offense pulling moves like a springboard over the top onto Savage but hit his ribs on the guardrail with Savage hitting a double ax right onto the ribs before continuing the brawling not only on the outside but destroying the stage as well & heading back to the ring where a television camera got destroyed & Elizabeth got involved too many times for one woman's taste as well. This match was no different than their entire rivalry, intense from start to finish & even after the match too.
WCW Halloween Havoc 97
[nWo: The Revolution]

(Blu-Ray) Lumberjack Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hogan came into this match with his ribs taped from a recent attack by King Kong Bundy as Hogan attacked right away & even took the match ot the floor despite the lumberjacks being around while Savage resorted to dirty tactics focusing on the injured ribs along with sending Hogan to the outside where certain lumberjacks took liberties with Hogan on the outside while Savage would later find out that there were lumberjacks that wanted a piece of him too in what was a fun match.
""Madison Square Garden"" Feb. 86

(Blu-Ray) vs. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan - The crown of ""King Of Wrestling"" was on the line here as Savage started off attacking from behind working over Duggan only for him to quickly recover & returned the blows causing Sherri on the outside to get involved in more ways than one on the outside for Savage to regain & keep control using dirty tactics as they traded momentum with Duggan not only sending Savage to the outside but the front row with the action starting to get out of control to the point where the referee ended up getting caught up in the action as this was pretty much a brawl from start to finish.
""Madison Square Garden"" Oct. 89

(Blu-Ray) w/Sting vs. Blue Bloods - Sting & Savage were headed into War Games as teammates & showed support for each other in unique ways during their ring entrances as this was an evenly matched contest with both teams working together with double team offense & using frequent tags with the only difference being how the Blue Bloods using dirty tactics such as taking advantage of the referee whenever possible.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Sept. 95

(Blu-Ray) vs. Booker T - Both men started out going back & forth trying to work over the arm with either a hammerlock or armbar before Booker started to get more aggressive taking the fight to Savage on the floor including the front row only for Savage to turn up the intensity himself using whatever he could grab on the outside as both men traded momentum in the ring in a match that was physical between both men to the point where more than one observer on the outside got caught up in the action & took matters into their own hands.

6600130,4,B00MQVSEZE,"Disappointed Vince McMahon and Warrior were not featured on this at all.  Vince is one of the few guys who could give insight on his early career and dealing with Randy outside the ring but doesn't participate in this, which only lends credibility to the online rumors of the reason for their issues.  No time was spent on the Warrior / Savage retirement match / angle.  Lots of interview segments from his Mom and Lanny though.  It was a decent bio, with a lot of time spent on his non-wrestling career, I just wish it had more insight on key moments of his wrestling career.  Still very good, but it jumps from WM V to his commentating career awfully fast.  Spent a lot of time on his death, which was unusual, but valuable.",1416960000,2,726,4.421052631578948
6600131,4,B00MQVSEZE,"I really enjoyed the documentary but I wanted more. Like others have said, they don't really discuss his feuds. I think that's because  they were trying to show us the man behind the performer and his work speaks for itself through the matches anyway.

There's lots of rare footage here, even behind the scenes footage of a perfectionist Randy preparing for his promos.  I loved listening to his costume designer discussing how Randy used his famous clothing and movements to hide his size in order to compete with the giants that took all the top spots in the WWE at the time. I'm going to be watching out for him standing on his toes all the time now.

Now on to what I didn't like. I grew up watching Randy and Elizabeth and I always wanted to know more about them. But here they just use their story for sensationalism.  After 10 years together, I am sure there was a lot more to their relationship than just jealousy. I wanted to hear about their on screen magic and chemistry but they are just so overwhelmingly negative that I felt I was watching 'the self destruction of Randy Savage' during this segment. And it's here you can see that Vince still has not forgiven Randy for what ever went down. I mean what Austin did to his wife was worse than Randy and I can't them going on and on about that in Austin's next DVD meant to HONOR him.

Speaking of Vince, his absence here is the elephant in the room. We can see through clips shown that the two were obviously close and that their fallout was a nasty one. They call this 'The Randy Savage story' but Vince is integral to Randy's story and he will not speak in it so the story does not feel complete. It's sad that Vince obviously has not forgiven Randy even in death.

But overall, it is a great watch, very emotional especially when we see his mother and hear how happy he was at the end of his life. The documentary portrays Savage to be a complex and fascinating character - just the thought of him reading 'the night before christmas' to disadvantaged kids makes me smile. The promo segment with Mean Gene made me laugh out loud. It was great to hear stories from those who knew him - I especially enjoyed Ricky Steamboat, Bret Hart and Kevin Nash's contributions. The matches are excellent, many of them unreleased before and show Randy to be the wonderful performer he was. Oooooh yeeeah!",1416960000,,2355,4.450116009280743

6600134,2,B00MQVSEZE,"They finally wrote off Macho Man in this horrible documentary. They don't cover his career well at all. No talk of his 2nd championship win, no talk of how he became the ""Macho King"", No talk on his accomplishments in WCW, no talk of his minute in TNA, which is important for fans to know about, among a lot of other topics. This documentary felt like watching a fast paced program on the WWE Network. It's also sad that only a handful of wrestlers who actually knew Macho Man talked about him in this. More of the newer WWE stars were talking about him, which felt weird being a fan and viewer because these people didn't know him and didn't really say how they were inspired by Randy Savage. The documentary alone is only 1hr and 30mins long. They missed out on other promotions he was in, accomplishments, and important matches in his career. The documentary didn't go into depth about anything other than his real life marriage with Elizabeth. Randy Savage deserves more than a ""lets make a buck off this guy's name DVD"". Does WWE even care about the talent that made it?",1416873600,3,1075,4.517948717948718
6600135,4,B00MQVSEZE,"Overall I thought it was a good documentary in learning more about Randy Savage the person through interviews with his brother Lanny, his Mother, along with people who knew him outside of the wrestling industry.  Like some have already said the documentary's main flaw is skipping over some key events in Randy's wrestling career.  I think it definitely could've used at least an additional half hour.  Randy's relationship with Hulk Hogan also came across as pretty fascinating.  It seemed like at one moment they could be best pals and that at another they would totally hate each other.

  It's interesting that there were no appearances by either Vince or Triple H in the documentary.  I did like that the documentary  gave some theories as to why Randy never returned to WWE once WCW went under.  He had a lot of pride and found some of the Nacho Man skits to be extremely hurtful.  On the contrary it seemed like Vince took Randy's depature hard and probably developed some sour grapes as well.  By the end of the documentary you feel that Randy Poffo was a very talented and complex man.  I do think the documentary should've been longer to cover some more career highlights.  But having said that I still enjoyed it.

  I haven't gotten to the matches yet but they seem like a good collection of matches to go along with the previous Macho Man DVD set.  Hopefully we'll finally get to see Randy's long overdue induction into the WWE HOF this coming year.",1416873600,2,1462,4.666666666666667

6600140,3,B00MQVSEZE,"Overall, I thought the DVD was a nice job but as a major Macho Man fan, it's missing a lot of key items:

- No inclusion of the period when Sensational Sherri Martel replaced Elizabeth as Savage's manager. The two were great heels together. Despite the on-camera ""feud"" between Sherri and Elizabeth, the women and Savage were friends in real life. It would have been great to have featured a clip or some part involving commentary from Sherri on their working together.

- Savage's early feuds in the WWF: his story angle rivalries involving George the Animal Steele and his pre-Mega Powers days with Hulk Hogan were great. Plus, his rivalries with the Honky Tonk Man, Jake the Snake Roberts and Ted DiBiase were well-crafted.

- It doesn't feel right to include Lex Luger in this video at all, since he has been linked to the circumstances that led to Elizabeth's death. I was surprised to see no interviews with Honky Tonk Man or Tito Santana included or other WWE legends like Steele or Howard Finkel.

Apart from his feuds with Ricky Steamboat, Hulk Hogan, and Diamond Dallas Page, most of his career was glossed over.  Other than Lanny Poffo and Bret Hart, the three mentioned are the only ones who contributed to any significant degree.  Also, why was Lex Luger included when he's probably to blame for the death of Elizabeth?

The documentary should have been twice as long and included at least something from Shawn Michaels and Triple H, since they're all over every other documentary the WWE produces.  It felt like the WWE cobbled something together to pay lip service to the fans but nearly every other documentary they produced has more meat to it.

There were some good parts, like hearing how Savage wanted to work with a young Shawn Michaels and put him over, and stories of Savage's transition from baseball to wrestling, but overall, it's a disappointment.  At least the matches were good.",1416355200,6,991,4.794117647058823
6600149,1,B00MQVSEZE,"So much wrong with the documentary.

So much.

First, you had excellent material to pull from a WCW produced (now owned by WWE) documentary called ""Behind the Madness."" If you haven't watched it, it's available on YouTube and offers an excellent insight into Randy's mindset circa 1997.

Most notable about this documentary is it stops documenting his WWF career in 1988: No Andre the Giant, no Dusty Rhodes, no Ultimate Warrior, no Ric Flair, no Macho Maniacs, no look into his aborted final push around Wrestlemania X.

And, as another commenter noted, the lack of Vince McMahon interviews is DEAFENING, completely making it obvious the stories of Randy and Stephanie are far more valid than the rumor mill would have you believe.

Randy had excellent feuds in WCW, but those are left on the chopping room floor save his program with DDP. Even this is only lightly touched upon.

The documentary can be summed up thusly: Randy Savage was a great wrestler and amazing entertainer, but he was a creepy dude because of the way he treated Elizabeth; but let's gloss over the fact they agreed to work together for years after their divorce in 1992 by teaming together in WCW...

One is hard pressed to guess why they didn't include any footage of Warrior talking about Savage, but perhaps the WWE is holding out to make a Savage-Warrior rivalry documentary. Perhaps the same is true of a future Flair-Savage documentary.

The only extra (on blu ray) worth touting, is the one where Dusty Rhodes tells a story about Savage in TNA: it speaks more to Savage's character than any action by the McMahon family combined.

RIP Randy: you deserved far, far better and the incredible charity work you did (the Christmas activity you participated in, mentioned in the documentary, was incredibly touching) was the ultimate highlight of this documentary.

The world was a better place because Randy Savage was in it, and the petty nature in which the WWF/WWE has treated his memory is embarrassing.",1416355200,12,1984,4.877976190476191
6600150,5,B00MQVSEZE,"Though Ricky Steamboat will go down as my all time favorite, Randy Savage was such a loving and infectious soul that you can't help but know this guy gave it his all in this business.  I'm so thankful that the WWE was able to put together a package that highlighted everything that Randy had done.  The day he died, I cried, today watching this, I again shed a tear because you just knew that behind all the flash was someone with an even bigger heart.

The only thing that still breaks my heart is that Randy and the McMahon's were never able to clear the air completely.  I would have really loved to have heard (away from the anger) what Vince thought of Randy when they were close back in the 80's & early 90's.

This is a HIGHLY recommended show to watch, and if you are a fan of the old days and the old school guys, you may want to have a tissue close by.  Enjoy Everyone!!",1416268800,,880,4.177514792899408
6600151,3,B00MQVSEZE,"It hurts me to write a review with a rating so low, but as a COLOSSAL Savage fan, I've waited a long time for a biography on his life and career. With that being said, it feels like there is so much missing from this release.

For example:

1. There is no mention of Savage's 1985 run against Hogan that really established him as a major player. In a period where Hogan was usually defending the belt every night against guys like King Kong Bundy, Kamala, Big John Studd, Don Muraco or Paul Orndorff, Savage was able to put Hogan in believable jeopardy as an undersized heel, and the fans bought it.

2. His career as Intercontinental Champion is glossed over even though his reign was more than a year long and is one of the greatest reigns ever. Savage headlined the WWF's B house shows for more than a year during this run which included sellouts in 1986 in places like Philadelphia and Chicago without Hogan even being on the card. So, as a main event heel Intercontinental Champion, Savage was a tremendous success at the box office, and this made him one of the logical choices to hold the WWF Championship when Hogan ultimately took time off. This was probably worth mentioning.

3. There is no reference to Savage's initial face turn and its significance. When Steamboat took time off and the Honkytonk Man was given the IC belt, Savage became a babyface in part because half of the crowds were cheering for him even when he was a heel, and partially because his heel run as IC champ drew so many fans to house shows that they trusted him in the headlining spot opposite the Honkytonk Man to continue drawing money. Again, there is no reference to this. Further, they made the statement in this bio that the Intercontinental Belt was always the belt for promising young talent, and this statement couldn't be more wrong. Initially, it was a belt for veteran, main-event caliber wrestlers who had the ability to headline house shows when the WWF/E champion was headlining elsewhere. Pedro Morales held the IC belt for more than 600 days in two reigns AFTER he held the WWF championship for more than 1,000 days, and he headlined shows against Don Muraco for YEARS. By the time Savage won it, at age 34, the average age of a IC belt holder the first time he wore it was something like 37 years old. Moreover, Savage was OLDER than Hogan, who was the reigning World Champion. So the WWE allowed the present state of the diminished IC belt as a mid-card stepping stone to bleed into the content of the DVD. Savage was stamped as a main eventer after his run with Hogan, and at that time the IC belt cemented his status as a headliner.

4. They don't even mention his run as ""Macho King"" or his association with Sensational Sherri. Back then, the King's crown was won in the ring like a normal championship and not won in a tournament (e.g., Harley Race to Haku to Duggan to Savage). For all intents and purposes, it was the WWF's version of the Word Television Championship. In essence, Savage was a mid-card champion as the ""King of the WWF"" for 19 months and none of this is mentioned. During this run, Savage, Sherri, Dusty and Sapphire had the first mixed tag team match in WWF history, and they did it at Wrestlemania 6. And, Savage defended the crown against all the top babyfaces other than Hogan and the Warrior, including Roddy Piper, Dusty Rhodes, Jim Duggan and Jake Roberts. Again, that was probably worth mentioning.

5. Savage's rivalries with George Steele, Jim Duggan, The Honkytonk Man, Dusty Rhodes, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake Roberts and Ric Flair aren't even mentioned. How they can completely overlook his career vs. career match with the Warrior is mind boggling.

6. The Mega Powers vs. Mega Bucks feud isn't mentioned. Nor do they mention the attempt to create another version of the Mega Powers with Savage and the Warrior paired as the ""Ultimate Maniacs"" prior to the Warrior's suspension just before a major Pay Per View against Ric Flair and Razor Ramon, and how this resulted in Mr. Perfect's face turn as Warrior's replacement, and the dissolution of another potential super team.

7. Again, the feud with Flair that resulted in Savage's Wrestlemania 8 title win isn't even mentioned. Everything about the booking of this match was controversial, not least of which was the fact that it replaced the Flair vs. Hogan dream match that was previously announced as the main event for Wrestlemania 8. The WWF teased a Savage-Elizabeth-Flair love triangle to raise interest in the match, Savage won the match one year after losing a career-ending match to the Warrior at the previous Wrestlmania, Flair kissed Elizabeth after the match, and it touched off an extended brawl and beatdown sequence that was HIGHLY irregular for WWF pay per views at the time. Of course, they don't show or mention any of this. In watching this DVD, you would almost think Savage's in-ring career in the WWF/E ended at Wrestlemania 5.

8. In WCW, Savage's run with Ric Flair revitalized his career, and it isn't even mentioned. Nor do they mention the awkwardness of working with Elizabeth in his corner on multiple occasions in WCW despite the fact they were already divorced. While they do mention how Savage was offended by WWE's comical references to his divorce during the Huckster/Nacho Man skits, they don't mention that Elizabeth turned against him to side with Flair in WCW while ostensibly spending Savage's alimony money from the divorce to treat Flair and the Horsemen. No mention of how the divorce was turned into a WCW angle is ever mentioned, nor how that affected Savage.

9. Vince McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, Triple H and Shawn Michaels do NOT contribute any interviews to this DVD. Given how much Savage's relationship with Vince is mentioned, given that they mention Savage left the WWF/E because Vince rejected his proposal to work a two-year program with Shawn Michaels, and given how he insulted Triple H and Stephanie on his website and this is mentioned as being problematic toward facilitating Savage's return to the WWE, you would think that at least ONE of these individuals would have contributed an interview to the DVD.

10. While the Hogan-Savage rivalry is played up throughout the biography, no mention of the fact that Savage NEVER got a pinfall win against Hogan in any setting is ever mentioned. The Hogan-Savage rivalry, on paper, is the most one-sided rivalry in professional wrestling history. When Austin finally allowed the Rock to score a clean pinfall on him at Wrestlemania 19, it was his way of paying back the Rock on his way out the door for making him. Similarly, Dusty and Flair both had their share of victories over one another. Savage NEVER beat Hogan cleanly despite about 15 years of working with him on and off and dragging some of his best matches out of him. Some mention of the unfair, one-sided nature of this feud should have been mentioned aside from simply saying ""Hogan was number one and Savage was number 1A.""

Sadly, I think this is a case where the WWE Network actually interfered with the product. It feels like material on Savage's career may have been withheld from this product so that they can produce more specials for the Network, like for the ""Rivalries"" series. I get it, but it results in DVD releases like this coming off as incomplete.

The reason this gets three stars from me is because of the in-depth attention to his upbringing, his baseball career and his family life. However, so many of the 90 minutes are dedicated to Savage's obsession over Elizabeth and their respective unhappiness that the overall feel of the DVD actually comes across as being a little somber. An additional 20 to 30 minutes that fleshed out details of his in-ring career would have been vastly appreciated. Seriously, when you consider how WWE has done significantly lengthier DVDs on Triple H, CM Punk, Edge, Chris Jericho, Mick Foley, The Rock, Steve Austin, Ric Flair, John Cena and PAUL HEYMAN (two hours), let alone how their last Austin release was two-and-a-half hours long, I don't think I'm asking for too much by requesting more than 90 minutes out of their Savage bio. It's truly, truly disappointing.",1416268800,169,8182,4.753521126760563
