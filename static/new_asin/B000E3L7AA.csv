8187594,5,B000E3L7AA,"Thanks for my mother who got the first DVD for this series for only $3.00, I can tell you one thing, I was surely NOT disappionted with this whole series (I have seen them all). The animation is Gorgeous for its age, the score is wonderfull, and it has a story that will get you hooked. The characters (even the antonginists) are very wonderfull. The only thing that weirded me was the OP animation, it may turn a lot of people off, but it is not the main point for there is more to the story than that. My only complaint was that the ending lacked detail, but everyone got saved, so I am happy. This mecha futureistic anime is really great, I recommned it for those who like the genre and people who adore pretty animation.",1215561600,3,724,4.291970802919708
