8132215,4,B000GH3BGC,"I'm into female-fronted bands so I purchased all 3 of this series, as a lot of the female-fronted bands I listen to is signed with Napalm Records. Not bad for a first outing. You get 19 videos, 8 live videos, The Special Features from Leaves' Eyes ""We Came With The Northern Winds"" DVD (this was no extra for me as I already owned the Leaves' Eye DVD), 3 videos from Wig Wam, and of course the CD of 16 tracks.
The Videos:
01. Atrocity - Cold Black Days
02. Battlelore - Storm Of The Blades 03. Journey To Undying Lands (Front woman Kaisa Jouhki)
04. Beseech - Innerlane (A favorite song from Beseech but what's with the video? An animatic video with no visual of Lotta Hoglin. Was excited to see Beseech on here but didn't know the band was nowhere on this video)
05. Darkwell - Fate Prisoner (A favorite song from the band with latest front-woman Stephanie Luzie)
06. Elis - Der Letzte Tag (My favorite video on here as this is a great song and video of the late Sabine Dunser)
07. Hurtlocker - Absoulution
08. Korpiklaani - Beer Beer 09. Kadet Siipina 10. Hunting Song
11. Lacrimas Profundere - Amber Girl 12. Ave End 13. Again It's Over
14. Leaves' Eyes - Elegy 15. Into Your Light (Same videos on the Leaves' Eyes DVD)
16. Sinamore - Darkness Of Day
17. Tyr - Regin Smidur 18. Hail To The Hammer
19. Visions Of Atlantis - Lost (Great song and video from the late Nicole Bogner)
The Live Videos:
01. Enthroned - Hellgium Messiah
02. Saltatio Mortis - Heuchler 03. Salz Der Erde 04. Mea Culpa 05. Junges Blut
06. Midnattsol - Infinite Fairytale 07. Desolation 08. Haunted (Haunted being my favorite song from Midnattsol of little sis Carmen Elise to Liv Kristine)",1364947200,3,1666,4.447712418300654
8132216,5,B000GH3BGC,"If you are a fan of Gothic, Viking, Folk or Atmospheric Metal in general and you don't know about Napalm Records then you are truly missing out. The label has been putting bands like this on the map for the past couple of years and it seems as though everything I hear from their artist roster is an enjoyable display of the wondrous differences one can have happen in Metal music. This DVD/CD release is a cornucopia of those acts and you as the viewer get video films as well as live performance footage of what they offer you. It's as much a fun thing to watch as it is a learning experience about bands that you would not have readily available to you in most areas or unless you knew exactly where to look for it. On the DVD you get 19 promotional videos and of the lot, I most enjoyed Leaves' Eyes, Korpiklaani and Tyr. Leaves' Eyes is one of the label's main artists so they also get an enjoyable special feature elsewhere on the DVD where you find them in studio and take a Winters Walk with singer Liv Kristine. It makes this something that a Leaves' Eyes fan will enjoy very much since there is a batch of extra footage on the band that they might not find anywhere else. Tyr is an interesting group from the Faroe Islands while Korpiklaani shows the world that even a flute or accordion player can find their way into a Metal group as they deliver some of the most rousing Folk Metal you will hear in a long time. If you enjoy Finntroll, then you will also appreciate Korpiklaani. The live performances on the DVD feature Midnattsol (a band that features Liv Kristine's sister), along with Enthroned and Saltatio Mortis. The wide variety of bands on the DVD make it something that you will enjoy watching from beginning to end, and perhaps even referring back to once in awhile. The best aspect for this would be it prompting you to look deeper into some of the bands, many who have reviews featured on this website.

A bonus audio CD that features music from additional bands such as Draconian, Summoning and Wig Wam among the others that are on the DVD portion round out the release and make it something truly worth picking up. The gates to new worlds await you inside the Realm Of Napalm Records. Isn't it time you go exploring? I think it's a good idea.",1162944000,2,2269,4.41527446300716
