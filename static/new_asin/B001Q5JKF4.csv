8335026,5,B001Q5JKF4,"This is a very good DVD describing the history of the Pennsylvania. There is a lot of early film footage, and some of it shows it's age. Some parts of it aren't as clear as new footage would be, but a lot of it was taken 60 or 70 years ago. For a railroad fan, this should be in your collection.",1381881600,,295,3.8524590163934427
