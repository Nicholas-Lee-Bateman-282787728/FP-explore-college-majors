8659485,4,B00KIZYFNU,"It's over 80 years old, but Carole Lombard's performance here is fun, and delightfully loopy. Her manic comic talents prove that she really was the 'pre-Lucy' Lucille Ball. Had she lived, Lombard probably would have found eventual success as a television comedienne, as well---few major female stars could pull off screwball comedy so naturally and convincingly.  Her rapport here with Fred MacMurray is natural, and the supporting cast is fine, moving the slight story along at a refreshingly brisk pace. A worthy DVD addition for collectors.",1532304000,,543,5.313953488372093

8659487,5,B00KIZYFNU,"Whatcha need to know? True Confession (1937) is a delightful screwball comedy from Paramount Studios.

Nowadays, if Fred MacMurray ever crosses your mind, probably you associate him with his hit television show, My Three Sons, or that batch of Disney movies he starred in in the '50s. But he's so much more prolific than that, the breadth of his talent so much more all-encompassing. He starred on the silver screen in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. He was the perfect match for Carole Lombard, the solid anchor to her offbeat interpretations. I don't know that True Confession is the best of their partnership - I'm partial to The Princess Comes Across - but you can't deny how watchable it is, just to see these two stars work.

Sensational news! Lawyer Kenneth Bartlett (MacMurray) - him what's honest to a fault and who only ever represents those he believes to be innocent - is defending his perjuring wife, Helen (Lombard), from a murder charge. He hinges his strategy on a plea of self-defense, only to learn she's innocent after all. There's more to it than that, naturally. With Kenneth's principles driving the Bartletts to the poor house, Helen, who tries to write fiction on the side, sees no recourse but to take on a part-time secretarial job to a broker (for $50 a week, natch). When the broker is found fatally shot, Helen is implicated. Factor in that Helen is saddled with an overcharged imagination and is a compulsive liar and, uh, doesn't really know shorthand, well, maybe you can see how things could spiral out of control...

Your enjoyment of this movie will depend entirely on how you approach Lombard's take. See, Lombard had always injected her performances with near demented energy and a rapid, breathy delivery. Somehow, she makes her characters so endearing and sympathetic. Helen Bartlett, chronic fibber, stretches the limits of Lombard's enormous likability. Helen's solution to any little dilemma is to spin a whopper, and that tests the authenticity of her as a character and tugs at the audience's patience. Yeah, her near pathological fibbing may be too much to absorb for some folks.

But there's something almost ethereal about Carole Lombard, she who was a free-spirited soul on and off the screen. You want to give her every leeway. I did. I loved her performance which borders on farce. It works because MacMurray, as her sounding board, is such a bedrock, so steady. He provides the grounding element, the counter not only to Lombard's daft presence but also to a very rumpled and most peculiar John Barrymore (he plays a self-avowed criminologist and student of life). Also, for a sight that's fresh, MacMurray sports a thin mustache in this one. Meanwhile, Una Merkel lends a smidge of norm as Helen's sassy best friend.

I consider True Confession a neglected gem. It's a screwball comedy thru and thru. It finds Lombard at the height of her powers, at the height of her beauty. And while MacMurray isn't his patentedly affable self, you're on his side from jump. See this movie for their back-and-forth and for Lombard's giddy frenzy and for Merkel's double takes and for the crazy stuff that goes down. Note that the final scene ignited a furor from them prudes from the Hays Code committee. So if you're of a mind for a whiff of naughty, see this movie for that, too.

By the way, if you're hankering for more of Lombard & MacMurray, you should think about maybe getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carole-Lombard-The-Glamour-Collection-Hands-Across-the-Table-Love-Before-Breakfast-Man-of-the-World-The-Princess-Comes-Across-True-Confession-We-re-Not-Dressing/dp/B000E6ESWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carole Lombard - The Glamour Collection (Hands Across the Table/ Love Before Breakfast/ Man of the World/ The Princess Comes Across/ True Confession/ We're Not Dressing)</a>&nbsp;instead.
