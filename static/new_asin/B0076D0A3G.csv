8510853,2,B0076D0A3G,"Though there are several mestres and professors involved in the creation of this video, there is no capoeira being played. If you are a students of capoeira and are looking for new material to study...this is not it. If you do not know what capoeira is...this is not it. If you want to see how Sesame Street and a someone on acid would interpret capoeira...this IS it!",1372032000,4,368,4.507462686567164

8510855,5,B0076D0A3G,"This video is well produced and the music is nice.  There is not your typical capoeira video.  There are great acrobatics and great games.  However, what really separated this video from many I have seen was the way the video is shot and the music that's played.  Some of the stills are amazing, almost life like.  The capoeira is hot.  This video is a great display of capoeira played at a very high level.  It is great from an inspiration perspective (i.e. I wish I could do even half of what I saw on this video), this is not an instructional video by any stretch.  The men and women who are in this video are all high level caporistas in their own right.  If you want to see some great acrobatics, outstanding capoeira games, and listen to some nice music, buy this DVD it's worth every penny.",1332460800,2,797,4.36734693877551
