8047441,1,B0007GP7QO,"I haven't seen the DVD release of ""Hail Mary,"" so I can't comment on its technical qualities.  But I CAN comment on the movie itself.

The movie is a vile piece of French s---.

The movie places the ""Holy Family"" (Jesus, Mary, & Joseph) into a 20th Century context, where the family lives in Paris and Joseph is a cab-driver.

The moment of the Incarnation of Jesus, or conception of Jesus inside his mother, is amazing.  ""Mary"" is shown in full-frontal nudity, writhing on her bed in sexual frenzy, as she is becoming pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

When this movie hit a single theater in Boston around 1989, it was this scene that drove hundreds of the faithful nuts.  Hundreds of them gathered outside the single theater in Cambridge (where else?) where the movie was showing to pray.  As a result, the movie received a lot of attention -- far, far more than it deserved.

The Archdiocese of Boston was smart enough to keep its mouth shut about the movie.  If the protesters had been equally as clever, the movie would have shown for a few days before a few dozens spectators and then quietly would have deservedly vanished.  But because of the protests, the movie showed to a packed house for several weeks, so that the protesters themselves were indirectly responsible for the greater desecration of the Holy Family.

Something happened near the end of the movie that caused the audience to do something I've never seen an audience ever do, before or since.  It's now about 12 years after ""Jesus"" was born, and he disappears for a few days.  When he returns, ""Mary"" asks him where he'd been, and ""Jesus"" replies, ""Woman, don't you know I must be about My Father's business?""

What a corny, lame, ham-handed line!  The audience groaned IN DISGUST when the line was uttered.

I was thinking about this film recently because as I write this, there is a great controversy in the Islamic world about a dozen tepid, lame cartoons that were printed in Europe that supposedly insulted the Prophet Muhammed.  The Muslims burned the Danish embassy in Syria to the ground, and have threatened to take hostages elsewhere.

""Hail Mary"" was a FAR MORE grievous insult to Christianity than were those lame cartoons.  Christianity and Judaism both get knocked daily far worse.  Yet, the Muslims have reacted in greatly more barbarous ways.

That may be ""Hail Mary's"" gratest contribution to civilization, allowing us to place gthe Muslims' childish behavior in its proper context...

8047442,1,B0007GP7QO,"I'm not even going to attempt a review of Jean-Luc Godard's film Hail Mary (Je Vous Salue Marie) here. The DVD is of such bad quality that I could not watch it all and returned it to the store.

As the reviews below point out there is nothing Digital about this release, it is a bad transfer of a VHS copy. How dare New Star Video sell this as a digitally remastered film! Shame on them for releasing such shoddy merchandise and taking our hard earned cash for it!",1121644800,4,464,4.213483146067416
8047443,1,B0007GP7QO,"I agree entirely with D. O. Hanlon.  This DVD should be avoided.  The picture quality is abysmal; looks like it's been transferred through a grey filter.  The cast ""extra"" includes a tiny bit of information about Mieville's short, The Book of Mary, which precedes Godard's feature; there is nothing about Godard's film at all. I'm returning mine for a refund.",1116374400,4,359,4.95
8047444,1,B0007GP7QO,"I would give the 1984 film Hail Mary (Je Vous Salue, Marie) by Jean-Luc Godard 4 stars out of 5. Sadly however I would give the recently released New Star Video/Jef Films version 1 star (0 stars if I could).

This DVD version is a disgrace and a rip off. The cover claims it is a digitally re-mastered version of the film. It is not. It is a DVD mastered from the analogue Video masters. For those not so technically minded it means that the non digital video originals from the 1980s have been digitised for this DVD. It is not sourced from an original print of the film. In fact the print is so bad that tracking marks can be seen constantly throughout the film. As a digital medium DVD does not track like video used to. This confirms this disks dreadful origins.

The quality of the image is worse than I could ever have imagined. The picture is blurred, dull and dark. Again this is a characteristic of its source. The sound is no better as it is fuzzy and distant. The burnt in subtitles on this film also proove problematic as each time a title appears or diappears the entire image changes colour ( a characterisitc of bad DVD source and encoding).

This DVD is totally unacceptable for a number of reasons. Firstly a Japanese DVD version prooves that the original film prints of this film are still available and in good condition. The Japanese version is beautifully restored and features a worthwhile behind the scenes featurette, not included on this disk. Secondly the full price of this DVD makes it nothing short of a rip off.

In the infancy of DVD a number of smaller companies produced DVDs of questionable quality. This was down to a lack of skilled DVD technicians and a lack of knowledge of the format and its capabilities. This is not however acceptable at this stage in the format's life.

Avoid this DVD of Hail Mary. It is a copy of the 1980s Vestron Video VHS version. The quality is no better and the price is a rip off.",1113436800,19,1947,4.442577030812325
