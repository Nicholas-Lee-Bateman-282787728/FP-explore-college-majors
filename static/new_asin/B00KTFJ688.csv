8661387,5,B00KTFJ688,"This mini series comprises 5 Powerful Episodes, it brought about a new chapter in the Power Rangers Legacy.

It begins with the creation of the Green Ranger.  Zordon is sabotaged and absent for most of the series.  The Rangers were all shocked about having to face another Ranger - one who seemed more Powrful than the other 5 put together.

The  Warrioress Scorpina was introduced, and she battled as ferociously as Goldar.  Jason was captured and nearly killed.  It gives the audience several MegaZord Battles, and the Mega Zord's defeat - by Goldar, Scorpina and Green Ranger.

The final episode has Zordon's return, and Jason breaks Rita's Spell, freeing Tommy.  Then Green Ranger joining them, turning the Power Rita had given him against her.

This Mini Series made them more powerful than ever.  Always ready to Morph into Action.  6 working together to fight evil.  To stop Rita, and all her Nasty Monster, from destroying the Earth and Ruling the Universe with Evil.  They'd never back down, because they were Power Rangers.",1453593600,,1033,4.930232558139535

8661389,5,B00KTFJ688,"As a '90s kid, I was a big fan of Power Rangers from its first episode up through the Zeo series. They had a lot of action-packed adventures and exciting moments. But the ""Green With Evil"" five-parter is in a class all by itself.

Whereas most MMPR episodes had a relatively cheesy monster and lame lessons about community involvement, environmentalism, and world peace (the kind of nonsense you hear in Ad Council radio spots), ""Green With Evil"" gives us none of that. It gives us intensity, suspense, a near-death experience, and all the action we can handle. The tone of this story arc is dark enough to appeal not only to grade-school kids, but to teens and even adults in their 20s and 30s who had the good fortune to grow up with the Power Rangers.

""Green With Evil"" took MMPR to a whole new level. It took a kids' show that hitherto had enjoyed modest popularity and turned it into a global phenomenon. It was so well done that it could have been a movie (and, as I understand, was adapted as a TV movie in Poland when it was dubbed in Polish). There are some shows that have an episode or episodes that are so good that it is said that, if you watch no other episode of that show, you need to watch that one. The ""Green With Evil"" five-parter falls into that category, just like the Michael Larson two-parter on ""Press Your Luck"" or ""Who Shot J.R.!?"" on ""Dallas"".

In a former time, individual MMPR episodes were available on VHS. Today, all episodes of Power Rangers are available on DVD box sets. But ""Green With Evil"" is the only set of episodes that you can get by themselves without having to purchase the entire Season 1. I heartily recommend ""Green With Evil"" to anyone who remembers their '90s childhood and who wants to relive the arrival of the coolest and most awesome Ranger of all time: Tommy, the original Green Ranger!",1434672000,2,1842,4.492537313432836
