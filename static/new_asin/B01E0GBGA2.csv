The 4 episodes are all fun to watch...light hearted fun ...good story lines.  The only reason this don't give it  5 stars from me is because it shows color on the dvd box front and back .... but all shows are black and white...I was expecting an old show that has had color added...not so! Otherwise a great purchase.  Jim Backus was very talented,  a true gem.",1483401600,,502,4.287234042553192
8757486,5,B01E0GBGA2,"The Jim Backus Show, a.k.a. Hot Off the Wire, was a fun little show that only lasted one season, but the little ensemble cast was A-one compared to a lot of shows of the era. This DVD features 4 shows, two of which are on the Television Legends boxed set that One Tree/Mill Creek put out years ago. Definitely worth a watch if you like sitcoms with good acting.",1468627200,2,361,4.246376811594203
