7893665,4,6305511691,"Return of the Chinese boxer is another one of Jimmy wang Yu's excellent if not really rediculess action packed martial arts masterpieces.  This movie has all of the campy, over the top fun that most bad 1970s Kung-fu movies are known for.  The plot line is sort of all over the place, with major plot pieces seemingly coming out of nowhere, and not much of it making any kind of sense, but the story isn't what makes this movie so enjoyable.  What makes this movie so enjoyable is all the rediculess over the top action( and trust me, there is a lot of it!).  Even though this movie is as cheesy as ever, the fight choriography actually isn't bad and is even rather great at times.  Jimmy wang Yu plays a patriotic martial arts fighter who must stop some kind of evil scheme that involves a Japanese ruler trying to take over some part of China, which for some reason involves having to kidnap a certain woman and steal some sort of specail sword in order to win the appreciation of some other army general.... or......well......I don't know.  It's something along those lines.  Honestly the audio on this DVD was so bad that I couldn't understand what was going on a lot of the time(and there are no subtitles either on this DVD).  But like I said earlier, the action is what makes this movie so good.  If you like the rediculess over the top action of old Kung-fu films, then this IS A MUST BUY.  I mean, I could talk for hours on end about the kind of crazy stuff that happens in this film, but instead I will just list some of it here:
-jimmy wang Yu fights a knife wielding assassin which involves him catching the knives mid-air using chopsticks.  (He can also walk up walls apparently)
-there is a martial arts ternemeant where evidently guns are allowed(who came up with that rule?)
-towards the third act of the movie, Jimmy Wang Yu has to fight Kung-fu zombies(I promise you, I am not making this up) by blowing them up with dynamite.
-the movie ends with an epic battle between jimmy wang Yu and a martial artist who for some reason is using an 8 barrel shotgun that seems to never run out of bullets.
So all in all, if you were wanting a movie with a good story, and interesting characters and depth, then this not for you.  However if you want to watch a really stupid, over the top, but still epic action movie that's just entertaining, then go ahead and get this.  I should warn you though, this DVD that it comes on is very low quality and looks more like a bad VHS tape.  It is watchable, but it's just a shame that this movie hasn't gotten a better quality release.",1467676800,,2583,4.376569037656904
7893666,4,6305511691,"DVD Review: Crash Cinema version. The picture quality is VERY Grindhouse but that is what I love. Crappy picture so kiss my a$$! It's not properly formatted properly on widescreen TV (smaller picture).

Movie Review: Another masterpiece directed and (I think) written by the GREAT Jimmy Wang Yu. Though the movie is, for the most part, re-utilized  ideas of Jimmy's previous movies, it's still a really well shot movie with great characterization and martial arts action. The story is incoherent and the acting is silly but who the f*** cares? It gets my recommendation.

Conclusion: 3 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 for Return Of The Chinese Boxer.",1426550400,,646,4.908256880733945
7893667,4,6305511691,"This film naturally appeared when its leading star was beginning to pass his prime. As the star of ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN, GOLDEN SWALLOW,RETURN OF THE ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN, THE CHINESE BOXER, and ONE ARMED BOXER, Wang Yu actually revolutionized the martial arts genre along with the Shaw Brothers film of Chang Che. But after leaving Shaw Brothers to branch off on his own as actor-director, his career gradually began to slide until his work appeared formulaic.  RETURN OF THE CHINESE BOXER reprises one of his major hits as actor-director. But, as one reviewer notes, it is episodic. Apart from the opening credits showing him in training (a common feature of these 70s films), Wang Yu does not appear until 20 minutes into the film. Obviously much of his energies went into directing the various martial arts scenes with Japanese actors. However, despite the developing puffiness of his face and a music score which borrows parts of Morricone's score from THE EXORCIST 2, this film is not without its pleasures. Wang Yu again uses the Thai boxer duo from ONE ARMED BOXER and brings in new elements such as the zombie martial artists who form a major challenge to the hero. Also, Wang Yu uses his own version of the mirror sequence from THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI when the villain enters a warehouse to find an array of dummies all resembling Wang Yu and challenging his perception. Although far from being his best work, RETURN OF THE CHINESE BOXER is much better than later films such as THE DRAGON SQUAD. Although the star has seen better days, his charisma and martial arts prowess still makes the film fascinating despite its narrative discontinuities.",992563200,8,1652,4.879003558718861
