8318642,2,B001LM64B0,"This could have been a favorite movie of mine - a nice escape with it's fun humor, romance and good actors. However, the movie gave in to the  modern trend of couples lacking self control and having sex in a bath after knowing each other only a short while; and drinking is overdone. The phrase ""you picked my flower"" or ""you picked her flower"" became tiresome. Great acting and otherwise fun screenplay wasn't enough to overcome a movie turned into the typical, but if that's what you want.",1440115200,,491,4.579545454545454

8318644,4,B001LM64B0,It is so good to watch a nice movie that doesn't take itself too seriously - I loved the characters (especialy Charlie - briliantly portrayed by Jason Flemyng) - just a quirky good fun English movie!!,1293321600,,200,4.583333333333333
8318645,4,B001LM64B0,"Lighthouse Hill is a fantasy, a romance and a comedy. But mostly, it is a film for anyone who has ever failed to be true to their own nature.

Charlie Davidson, an outwardly successful man, struggles against societal expectations. Charlie is publisher of an award-winning magazine, yet sees only his failures. After an investor backs out of a deal that would take the magazine to greater heights, Charlie and his partner are put into a terrible bind. Charlie's first instinct is to run, and the characters he meets along the way could fill a season full of Seinfeld episodes.

The original music, by Christopher Gunning, is evocative of both the locations and the emotions. Cinematograher Tony Imi does some excellent exterior work. I only wish we had more shots from the top of the lighthouse. Imi and editor Alan Strachan do a good job ""dirtying up"" some flashback footage to excellent effect.

The cast is good, with standout performances by Jason Flemyng as Charlie, John Sessions as Mr. Reynard and Annabelle Apsion as Honey Alexander.

The screenplay by Sharon Cobb has some nifty twists. I empathize with both Charlie and his mother. Ms. Cobbs writes well-rounded characters: there are no Snidely Whiplashes here.

There is excellent chemistry between Charlie (Jason Flemyng) and Grace (Kirsty Mitchell).

Recommended.",1238803200,,1325,5.111111111111111
8318646,4,B001LM64B0,"What if you had given up all hope of following your passions or finding true love all in the name of pleasing everyone else?  Charlie Davidson feels that in order to win everyone's approval (especially his mother's) he turns to a loan shark rather than friends or family to save his fledgling magazine.  Following a bizarre accident, Charlie runs from his life stumbling upon the village of Lighthouse Hill and its eccentric residents who would prefer to stay hidden away in its fantasy world rather than let the outside in.

Lighthouse Hill, a quirky British romantic comedy starring Jason Flemyng, is a feel-good story telling us we can find hope and love in very strange places. When Charlie meets Grace, the village beauty following her father's footsteps restoring an ""antique"" carnival, everything about this odd town, and his life, begins to make sense.

Directed by David Fairman, the film is awkward in direction and editing in some scenes, well done and hilarious in others.  Sharon Y. Cobb's delightful script has you identifying with at least one of the characters.  Whether it's Grace, as she honors her dead father's dream, Charlie, as he becomes aware of the irony of his choices, or Alfred's inability to cope with his son's death 20 years ago, someone in the story will move you.  You will find the film's sweetness mixed with lots of sass keeps it from becoming overly sentimental or sappy.

Good date movie!  Curl up with your partner, a favorite glass of wine and enjoy its ""magic"".",1237507200,,1502,4.858823529411764
8318647,3,B001LM64B0,"A very low-budget attempt at creating that fantasy village where the main character learns about himself whilst the outside world knows not of its existence. But instead with Lighthouse Hill, the outside world intrudes and the main character should not have even been there.

Jason Flemyng (almost 25 films ago as this was made in 2002) plays our lost soul who stumbles upon this mysterious carnival town while being pursued by loan sharks. The small staff of squatters appear to be insightful regarding life, love and the pursuit of happiness, but not all is well as the outside world tries to keep him trenched in reality. The love interest, played by Kirsty Mitchell, is a ringer for Jennifer Connelly and as it played in the store several customers thought it was a JC film.

The story is basic, the filming low budget, but it has a feel-good theme to it of finding love and happiness. Flemying seems out of place, but fans of his might want to see a different role outside of the Guy Ritchie/Bobby Z kind of roles. The film had a hard time finding what it wanted to be, maybe somewhere between a romcom and a fairy-tale town, but never really gets there either way. DVD is devoid of anything extra and the sound is 2.0. Would recommend as a mellow evening rental.",1236988800,,1268,4.606194690265487
