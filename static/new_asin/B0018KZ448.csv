8269952,5,B0018KZ448,"I understand why some people object to this movie's equating the plight of illegal immigrants and exploited factory workers with the Shoah (the Holocaust).

The Jewish people are at this moment at greater risk than they have been since the Germans exterminated them in Europe during World War II. They are surrounded by hordes of brutal, ruthless monsters no less dedicated to their destruction than the Germans were 70 years ago

But it's worse now, because they are effectively all alone against a force thousands of times larger than they are (billions against a few million), with NOBODY on their side, not even their former official ""Protectors"", the British.

During the Shoah, most civilized countries supported the Jews' right to exist (in theory, at least); but now the whole world prefers the Palestinians, whose declared aim is the total destruction of Israel. Israel's only remaining friends - the Americans - currently seem more interested in courting Israel's enemies than in insuring Israel's survival.

Anybody who says the nation Israel is not the same as the Jewish people is either criminally deluded or a liar. Israel's enemies hate it because it's Jewish. Period. If they could wipe out the Jews all over the world they'd do it gleefully, but Israel is a much more convenient target, an isolated, vulnerable surrogate for the whole.

In the light of this alarming situation, to compare France's arresting illegal immigrants to Germany's systematically murdering Jewish children is appalling. Nevertheless... I was bowled over by this movie.

It is a deceptively powerful movie - deceptive because it seems to amble so slowly and randomly toward its conclusion; powerful because it makes old news new and vitally important. Instead of cheapening the Shoah, for me it made that horror realer than I thought possible after a long lifetime of learning about it.

I DON'T think the current plight of illegal immigrants (or Palestinians, who are a particularly rapacious sort of illegal immigrant) is anything like the Jews' plight during the war, but this movie doesn't force me to accept that absurdity. It makes what was done to the Jews real, and it strengthens my commitment to Israel's survival rather than diluting it.",1386201600,,2240,5.120547945205479
8269953,5,B0018KZ448,"As consequence of a transcendental top management decision, a Parisian petrochemical company forges on into the 21st century, the human resources psychologist leads a probe that proves the ghosts of the previous century still hold sway over current events in director Nicolas Klotz's labyrinthine drama. Simon (Mathieu Amalric) is a human resources worker who has spent the last seven years working at the Paris branch of a powerful German-based company called SC Farb. In addition, to assessing the hiring and firing practices of the company, Simon was also charged with the task of conducting motivational workshops. When Assistant Director Karl Rose (Jean-Pierre Kalfon) implores Simon to conduct a clandestine assessment of firm director Mathias J&uuml;st's (Michael Lonsdale) mental health after rumors of erratic behavior begin to circulate in the German head office, the shrewd human resources worker forms a factory orchestra as a means of stealthily gauging the stability of his violin-playing subject.

So, as the goal is undertaking, the complex limits between reality and insanity become more and more blurried, the dark web of intrigue continues increasing taking advantage even the very investigator.

Later, a comprehensive investigation of company archives and anonymous letters begin to snake ominously back in time to the darkest days of World War II.

A film that will fascinate to many, but at the same time can make others leave the hall, due the enormous concentration it demands.

8269954,3,B0018KZ448,Maybe it's just me but the thread of the story was hard to follow. Certain scenes that didn't advance the plot lingered for too long. The result was a movie that didn't engage either my wife or I.  It did lead to some interesting discussion afterward when we finally started to make sense of it.,1257638400,,295,4.363636363636363
8269955,5,B0018KZ448,This film paints a metaphor by constructing a story about music (as the human soul) in a big corporation (our society). And also proves one assertion that the recalling memories of the old sins never leave human being even if he is only a witness. So there is a Parisian psychologist (Mathieu Amalric) who is to follow one human fate only to discover the pain added on another pain and so on... He is on the way to resolve his own illusions or maybe only to make the first step to do so. We don't know a lot because some things in life happen in a darkness...,1236211200,3,559,4.233644859813084
