7271005,3,B00Z710TR6,the hey arnold episodes are really good. the angry beaver episodes might be better enjoyed by younger kids. the ahhh real monsters episodes are really good as well. the catalog episodes are so so and might be enjoyed better by younger kids as well. the rock's modern life episodes are not so great. perhaps if you have young kids this might be the best buy for you but if you don't than I would keep on looking for a better collection of movies.,1477612800,,445,4.373493975903615
