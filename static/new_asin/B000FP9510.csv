8306127,3,B000FP9510,"I purchased this DVD some time ago hoping that it would assist me in applying modal voicings, which it does.  The video is a recording of an hour long live presentation given at the Berklee School of Music.  The material is covered at a comfortable pace and Peckham presents effectively.  What really bothers me, however, is that the Peckham refers to written materials during the presentation.  The DVD does not include any written materials.  They are not on the DVD, and I could not find them at the publisher's website.  Should these materials been readily available on the disc or on the internet, the rating for this item would be much higher.",1198800000,7,649,4.75
