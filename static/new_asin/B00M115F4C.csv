6546231,5,B00M115F4C,"I loved Rocket Power as a kid and still love it to this day! I can not completely describe how thrilled and excited I was to find these on amazon! Since it is made on demand, it has a very simple menu. I don't even care about the menu. It allows me to pick and choose my episodes. The only problem with this is that the intro is super loud and then the rest of the episode is rather quiet. It doesn't even bother me enough to take away a star. This is the best thing to happen in my adult life and I can't wait to share this.",1456790400,,525,3.8256880733944953

8669576,2,B00M115F4C,I got season 3 and season 4 for a friends birthday. Which was this past weekend thought Id buy a few small things as we set a limit on what to spend so we don't put do each other. Well went to play season 3 and the first disc didn't even work we tried it on 4 different dvd and a blue ray/dvd player that I just bought myself not very happy but the other 2 disc in season 3 played as we skipped around a lot. To see if it could play we didn't even try season 4. Since we were bummed out on season 3.,1528070400,,499,3.6728971962616823

8669584,5,B00M115F4C,"The 3rd season of Rocket Power features, Twister, alias Twist, alias Maurice, on the front cover and menus. For reasons that are complicated to figure out, the 4th season came out before the 3rd season. Maybe that's why some folks say a small amount of the content of the show's first TV movie, Race Across New Zealand, was omitted from here, including the song ""Individuality"". Oh well, better to have it like it is, than not to have it on DVD at all. Same way with ChalkZone's series set having content omitted due to legal complications, as well as the pilot episode of SpongeBob from its 1st season set, and especially a ton of omitted content from all 3 original Ren and Stimpy sets (despite being sold for adults only for those 3)! At any rate, season 3 of Rocket Power contains Race Across New Zealand, the show's first TV movie, and 34 11-minute segments in 17 other shows, including the Cinco de Mayo episode, where Twister's voice cracks, and not from his catching a cold! Team Rocket always knows how to have a good time, even if it means getting ""busted"" by their elders for it, or getting in trouble for disobeying said elders. Contrary to popular belief, Rocket Power had 4 seasons, not 3, the 4th season was almost entirely made up of specials and TV movies, reaching 71 shows in all, even bypassing CatDog's total episode count by just 3 shows! Stay tuned for my review of the 4th and last season set of Rocket Power, dudes and dudettes!",1459555200,,1453,4.549618320610687
