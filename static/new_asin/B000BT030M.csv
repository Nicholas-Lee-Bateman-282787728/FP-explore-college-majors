2439978,1,B000BT030M,"over the years this movie has ignorantly used over and over as a tool of evil. there, i said it.

and YES, i absolutely am a christian.

fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.

the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman->
most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!

this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom.",1236816000,,435,4.023255813953488
2439979,4,B000BT030M,"Partial birth abortion, also known by the nicer-sounding ""Dilation and Extraction"" is one of the most disgusting, nauseating so-called medical procedures in the world. While it may sound innocuous, the details of the procedure are enough to turn the stomach. It is the closest thing to legalized murder I could imagine. A Distant Thunder, a half-hour long supernatural thriller, is an attempt to draw attention to this procedure, which is generating increasing controversy as more states and nations consider legalizing it.

The short but intense movie goes something like this: ""Struggling to keep her fragile sanity from unraveling, Prosecutor Ann Brown is offered a murder case that will challenge everything she believes is true. Uncertain at first whether to accept the assignment, a harrowing encounter with Defense Attorney Tom Condan convinces her to meet the challenge. The deeper she investigates, reality and tormenting delusions collide as she encounters an evil force as unnerving as it is foreboding. Terrifying secrets are exposed, and you'll discover the shocking twist which reveals the chilling and unforeseeable truth.""

Overall, the presentation is quite good. The acting is sound and the story moves along well (though I had guessed the shocking twist before it was revealed--something, as my wife can attest, that is rare for me!). The supernatural elements, along with a shower scene (where no nudity is seen due to strategic camera work) render this a movie that requires parental guidance. The DVD includes an edited version which, though I did not view it, presumably removes these scenes. It extras also include a conversation with the filmmakers, commentary with several of the cast members, commentary with the writer/director, and a trailer.

This DVD is a clever and possibly-impactful way of introducing the brutal injustice of partial birth abortion to people who may not care to read about it or who may never otherwise be presented with the facts.",1200960000,2,1982,5.305732484076433
2439980,5,B000BT030M,"I rated this 5-Stars on the issue the film was intended to depict, however I don't think it went far enough.  The ""whatever"" is was that was ""getting closer"" and causing the visions experienced by and tormenting the prosecuting lawyer was never identified--and these took a large part of this all too short film. Then, the relationship of the prosecuting lawyer to her obviously mentally disturbed and largely unresponsive mother--who in the film was also experiencing horrific visions--could have been resolved in a way that would have further covered the subject of partial birth abortion, but this was apparently not the director's purpose. We're given the detailed gross aspects of the procedure which I found disgusting (the director's goal?) and at the very close of the film, another vision(?) assaults the daughter when her mother is called to the stand as a witness for the defense and after that's over, the daughter walks off hand in hand with the senior principal of her firm and the film fades to black. The film--for me--was too disjointed, and leaves too much up in the air with no meaningful resolution for the characters portrayed or the issue it documents. I feel that the subject of partial birth abortion deserves better treatment than this film provided.",1184112000,6,1275,5.014150943396227
2439981,5,B000BT030M,"This is a short but powerful film about a legal case involving partial-birth abortion.  Very well made and suberbly acted, this movie easily stands up to anything produced by mainstream Hollywood.  Though genuinely apolitical, the film forces the viewer to consider their own views about the horror of partial-birth abortion in a very meaningful way.  It may be helpful to view it more than once or to see it in a group and discuss it afterwards, as subtleties may be missed the first time around.  It's no surprise that many people have never even heard, let alone seen this film.  But I would bet that anyone who does, cannot help but be moved.

I would not recommend to most children under the age of 15, as some scenes are intense and may be frightening, however, I would not hesitate to encourage any high school or college-age student to watch, especially as it is likely to spur discussion.",1161302400,6,897,4.681528662420382
2439982,5,B000BT030M,"This is one of the most moving (and frightening) films you may ever see. In a mere 35 minutes it cuts through the political rhetoric, shows you what the Planned Parenthood crowd keeps so secret, and goes to the heart of the matter - morality in our country, our courts, and in our own lives.

Jonathan Flora (writer, director, and cameo performer) and wife, Deborah Flora (Ann Brown), two of the finest Chriatians I have ever met, bypassed the leftist Hollywood establishment to produce this film on their own. Not only does this speak for their courage, but it gives reason for hope that once again we can become a nation that respects not just the lives of some, but of all.

You will love the surprise ending!",1149292800,13,712,4.5546875
2439983,5,B000BT030M,"My sister-in-law recommended this film to me.  It's laced with  brilliant subtle dialogue and sci-fi effects, while building to a very thought-provoking climax.  It's one of those films I had to watch again to get the clue-filled conversations.  I have fun convincing my friends to watch it without revealing the underlying message.  I recommend with whole heart.",1145491200,13,363,5.298245614035087
2439984,5,B000BT030M,"A legal thriller that handles a politically divisive subject well. Better-funded than most ""independent"" ""Christian"" films, this is a must-see for all thinking Americans. If by end of the first act you aren't sure where you stand on partial-birth abortion, check yourself again during the end credits. You may be surprised to find you see the issue more clearly than before, and without the spin of politics. Where you find ""right and left"", there is also and always ""right or wrong"". Right or Wrong should be what inspires you in life.",1138752000,29,536,4.9010989010989015

It puts to light very accurately what partial birth abortion is all about and what it does not only to the mother but the unborn child.

8091979,5,B000BT030M,"This movie really shocked me... it's in a strange type of genre of ""psycho-thrillers"" (though ""thriller"" is hardly suitable)
The overall plot is quick (35 minutes) but every moment is important, and the ending has a very jolting surprise.

The content is too heavy for anyone under 13. There are no scenes of abortion itself, but instead frightening flashes of people in the dark, blood, mummies, and other things that evoke the idea of homicide.
But there is a filtered version also on this DVD for broader audiences.

It is worth buying - I've heard of testimonies of changed hearts after seeing this movie.
Best line in the movie - ""The difference between [partial birth abortion] and homicide is just 3 inches"" (Deborah Flora)",1258416000,3,730,4.879032258064516
