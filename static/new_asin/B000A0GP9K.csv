8071218,5,B000A0GP9K,It's interesting and worth watching! Greg Prevost is the best thing in this band!,1475625600,,81,4.857142857142857
8071219,3,B000A0GP9K,"great price and fast shipping;
I didn't really care for the movie itself; but love that band!",1472169600,,93,4.529411764705882
8071220,4,B000A0GP9K,"As other reviews say, a B movie classic, a long form video for the song ""I don't understand"" that morphed into a romp around the globe.",1458604800,,135,4.230769230769231
8071221,4,B000A0GP9K,"I admit prejudice because I love The Chesterfield Kings, but this disc is such a raucous masterpiece I don't know where to begin..  The blurb ""A Hard Day's Night meets Ed Wood"" sums it up perfectly.  The video extras from the premier are funny and interesting, and the appearance of Mark Lindsay guesting with the band on a number is a historic pairing.  I only gave this four stars (in fairness) because if you're not already a Chesterfield Kings fan, this probably wouldn't have quite as much impact.  If you're already a fan you'll love it, if not you're about to become one.",1362441600,2,578,4.58252427184466
8071222,3,B000A0GP9K,"""Where Is The Chesterfield King"" is a fun watch but disappointing at the same time.  Very enjoyable musically and takes you back to the mid 60's garage band sound.  It was kind of a low budget poor version of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and not anywhere on par with ""Help"" or ""Head"".  It does appear to be a hodge podge of all these type movies.  Three stars say ""It's OK"" and two stars say ""I didn't like it"".  I'd really rate it somewhere in between.",1258761600,,447,4.273809523809524
8071223,5,B000A0GP9K,"What the Marx Brothers rubbed off on the Beatles, The Three Stooges rubbed of on the Chesterfield Kings! Humorous romp with the Kings of Rochester that compliments the films ""Help""(Beatles) and ""Head""(Monkees). If Tarintino made a Rock and Roll movie I would envision ""Where Is The Chesterfield King"". Very enjoyable! Great to see an appearance by Paul Revere and the Raiders own Mark Lindsey. Fun for All!",1176508800,3,406,5.074626865671642
