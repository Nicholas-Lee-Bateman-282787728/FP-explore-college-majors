4666980,5,B005ENCIUI,"Jim Rosin's  account of Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics 1901-1954 is a true work of art that all baseball fans regardless of team affiliation will enjoy. The names of Foxx, Grove, Simmons, Cochrane & Mack are familar to all fans of America's Pastime. Any crital comments about Rosin's work should be disallowed because that writer is not familar with baseball in Philadelphia As a co-founder of the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society we highly recommend any baseball fan to purchase this beautiful collection & tribute to one of baseball's founding fathers, Great work Jim.",1317686400,12,585,5.358695652173913
4666981,5,B005ENCIUI,"The review below is wrong. Baseball in Philadelphia did not start with the Phillies in 1883. There were Philadelphia Athletics teams in the National Association and the National League before the Phillies ever came to town, though they were not the Connie Mack A's, who arrived in 1901 and who are the subject of this fine documentary. Jim Rosin hits the spot with this one, and we can all bask in the reflected greatness of Chief Bender, Eddie Plank, Jimmy Foxx, Eddie Collins, Mickey Cochrane, Al Simmons, Lefty Grove, Ferris Fain, Bobby Shantz, and so many more.",1314489600,9,565,4.835051546391752
4666982,1,B005ENCIUI,James Rosin's documentary on the birth of baseball in the City of Brotherly Love. - This is incorrect!  Baseball was born in Philadelphia in 1883 with the Phillies.  A's came in 1901.,1313539200,2,183,4.6875

8468811,4,B005ENCIUI,Hosted by the great Bill Campbell. I think this might have been from the great defunct Prism. Prism was a pay channel on local Philly cable TV. I miss it soooooo much. Comcast sucks.,1440979200,,182,4.382352941176471

8468813,5,B005ENCIUI,"Great documentary.  I bought this simply because I love baseball, and the price of the dvd was so low.  I didn't expect much, but it turned out to be one of the best team documentaries I've ever seen.  I liked how it just followed the team through the years, not veering into silly side stories as so often happens in these kind of productions. One wish would have been for some more/better movie footage, especially of the great A's teams of 1929-32. (Perhaps none exists?) The film is nearly all still shots, but excellent narration keeps it interesting, even in their bad years from 1935-46.",1418774400,5,594,4.6380952380952385

8468815,5,B005ENCIUI,Shibe Park became known as Connie Mack Stadium and was used by the Phillies until Veterans Stadium opened in 1971. The Old Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium was located at N. 21st St and W. Lehigh Ave in Philadelphia. At N. 22nd St and W. Lehigh Ave is Dobbins High School and my sister went there in the 1960's. I remember going to school with her for some reason and walking around the class while the teacher spoke. I got to the windows and was frozen with excitement as I saw my first professional baseball stadium... Connie Mack Stadium (Shibe Park). There was a day game going on but I could see very little of the field... but I could hear the crowd and was hooked. Many years later I did some work a few blocks from there... and still thought of that day when I was a child. My neighbor in Philly (kid like me) went to the last game at Connie Mack and the first game at the Vet. He brought home parts of the wooden seats from the last game at the Mack and let me show my Mom. That's as close as I got to Shibe/Mack Park. My first ballgame that I remember was at the Vet... with free tickets from the local P.A.L. (Police Athletic League). It was Baltimore vs the Phillies in a pre-season game... We even went down on the field after the game (and I filled my pockets with a few hands full of dirt from the Vet infield). To me the Vet was awesome (since I was a kid)... but Shibe was a beautiful building and ballpark from what I've seen. Now even the Vet is gone... and soon this old kid will be gone just like them. Time waits for no one. There is now a church located where Shibe Park once stood. I guess that God wanted his sacred ground back.,1404086400,10,1651,4.146417445482866
8468816,5,B005ENCIUI,"This highlights the 1910s, late 20s and 1948 very well.  I found it very entertaining and my wife didn't object to having to sit through it.  I'm glad I bought it.",1377475200,3,163,4.225806451612903
8468817,4,B005ENCIUI,"The narrator covers each year of the teams existence (from 1901-1954) in Philadelphia, but also opens with some historical background of baseball in Philadelphia towards the end of the 1800's as well.  Material presented for each season provides great tidbits and quick narrative how the season went, and relies mostly on still B&W photos in the background in order to present the story. In a way, it is almost like a talking scrapbook, and the production is well made.  My only complaint is that I wished that it could've had a bit more old film and footage of that sort (yes, I know it was hard to find old game footage from back in those years, but that is what I had hoped the video contained a bit more of).  As a result, I took one star off for that, but with regards to the historical material presented, it is 5-stars without a doubt.  I will say this after watching it, I would've loved to have seen a game at old Shibe Park given how it looked in the photographs and some of the footage in this DVD.",1360108800,7,1009,4.351063829787234
