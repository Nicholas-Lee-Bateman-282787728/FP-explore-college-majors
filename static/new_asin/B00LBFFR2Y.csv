6478935,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"When it comes to the actual film I enjoy it, but personally it wouldn't make my top 10 slasher films. My rating for the film would be either 3-stars or 3.5 (I'd lean more towards the latter). There are some issues with the pacing and the disco dancing can get a little tiresome. There are viewings when I can zone out at times whereas other times even if I feel the pace is a little sluggish the film holds my interest. So while Prom Night may not make my top 10 80s slasher films I still enjoy it and the final act (outside of the disco scenes) are actually fairly well put together. There are a million reviews on the film and I even have one, which is un-posted as of now, but for this release I figure I'd focus on the blu-ray.

Prom Night has had several home video releases from VHS to DVD and all were quite subpar with the biggest complaint is the film was too dark. I've never seen the Anchor Bay release so no comment, but of all the releases the Echo Bridge DVD was the best, which is quite ironic seeing as Echo Bridge is typically bottom of the barrel. The absolute worst edition was the Platinum release, which looked like it was taken from an old VHS and most likely because it was. While Scream Factory gets all the hype, which is easy to understand and while I love Scream Factory, but I've never been overly impressed with their HD quality with a few exceptions. While the good bulk of their releases look good, but companies such as Synapse, which doesn't get half he amount of attention I feel release far better HD quality and Prom Night is no exception. For DVD buyers I cannot comment on how it looks, but my guess is the transfer is from the same source as the blu-ray and in that case I'd say its a worthy upgrade, as for the blu-ray, Synapse put a lot of,care into this one. This is by far the best Prom Night has ever looked. While it isn't perfect, but any flaws with the video stems from the negatives and not with Synapse. Colors are quite strong and the film has a natural look to it with a fine layer of grain, with only in a couple of scenes being overly grainy. The print here is also a little brighter and we can actually see what's happening in the final act.

Past DVD releases certain scenes looked like it was shot on video whereas now it looks like film, which was what it was shot on of course. I really can't say enough about how terrific Prom Night looks and in my opinion it's one of the very best transfer of an 80s slasher.

As for the extras there's a trailer, TV spots and radio spots, photo gallery (if not mistaken blu-ray only) as well as behind the scenes footage (no sound also blu-ray only), scenes from the TV version and a 41-minute feature about the film the several members of the cast and crew and an audio commentary (which I haven't listened to). And there's also reversible artwork.

If you're a fan of,the film toss away your DVDs and upgrade. Even for those who aren't fans may have a different view seeing it in HD. Even though I liked the film I think in someways seeing such a better quality print heightened my enjoyment. As I stated since I haven't seen the DVD from Synapse I can't comment on it, but I'm sure it won't differ from the blu-ray (of course excluding the basic upgrades from DVD to blu-ray).

Synapse delivers a terrific edition and I'd no doubt rate this as one of the best releases of 2014. Lastly so everybody knows the running time is 93-minutes, which is 4-minutes longer than the Echo Bridge version. There isn't anything missing from the Echo Bridge DVD nor is there anything added to the Synapse release. The Echo Bridge version was slightly sped up, which is the reason for the different running times.

6478936,5,B00LBFFR2Y,"Odds are, if you're looking at this, you know the story. If not, here we go:
Four tweens accidentally kill a girl in some weirdly threatening version of hide and seek. They vow to never tell anyone... but little do they know, someone saw everything. Six years pass, and it's the night of the prom. The now teens start getting calls and stuff and then the heads roll to a disco beat.

I've loved this film since I saw it on the Syfy network when I was in like 2nd grade. The previous releases don't hold a candle to this one. The picture and sound quality is astounding. You know how it has that 'hazy/dream-like' filter? Well, it looks pretty good here, for once. It's got great balance. You can see everything. You'll probably see things you might not have noticed before, especially in the night scenes. There are a few parts where it gets a bit grainy, but overall, it's clear and looks crisp.
The special features are to die for. You like that? Lol. But yeah. It's great to see the cast and crew, still proud of a little film they made 35 years ago. And after viewing the trailer and many TV spots, the ad campaign was pretty strong too! No wonder this is often remembered as one of the 1980s better slasher offerings.

For you first timeys, I'll let you know a few things: This film kind of has a bad rep because of the disco, but it's not exactly a major thing. Also, people complain about it being 'slow'. Oh, you mean because half the cast doesn't die within the first 30 minutes? Lol. There's not oodles of gore like Friday the 13th, but the characters (in my opinion), are pretty likable. You care about them and are genuinely frightened for them. And HELLO, this movie was one of the first slasher films off the Halloween success cannon. The standards of the genre weren't quite developed yet, and that's why there's character development before gore galore and a kill every five minutes. I think the last 30 minutes of the film is classic though.

So duh, pick up this release! Okay? Synapse did a great job, as usual. You won't be disappointed.",1410480000,6,2057,4.450928381962865

6478938,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"One of my favorite 80's horror flicks finally gets the loving respect it deserves in a Synapse special edition Blu Ray (also on DVD). Before you start thinking, ""oh great, yet ANOTHER issue of this 1980 slasher."", hold up, this one is different and presented like never before, and packed with solid special features which include:
- A new beautiful 2K scan HD transfer in 16x9 1.78.1
- A brand new 5.1 surround sound mix specially created for this release (also in original 2.0 mono)
- Captioning in English (only) for the hearing impaired or hard of hearing.
- Reversible cover featuring the classic original poster art & foreign version, which looks very nice too.
- About 9 minutes of additional scenes that were added for the original NBC TV Broadcast (though nothing spectacular)
- A new 25 minute behind the scenes making of Featurette: The Horrors of Hamilton High: The Making of ""Prom Night"".
- An insightful audio commentary with Director Paul Lynch & Screenwriter William Gray (the moderator is very annoying!)
- The original trailer & rarely seen tv spots (4 of them) were nice too; which were legendary in 1980, with the great tag line:
  ""If you're not back by midnight, you won't be coming home!"". Great memories!

My only complaints are that during the 23 minutes of rare outtakes (exclusive to the Blu Ray version), there's no dialogue, it's just music from the soundtrack, and it would have been nice to hear what's being flubbed and talked about between takes.  Also, the old iconic Avco/Embassy logo is missing from the opening, despite everyone talking about A/E in the extras... It says on the packaging that the program content is licensed from Echo Bridge, and none of their (EB's) previous DVD versions had the A/E opening.. I can't recall if the original 1998 Anchor Bay DVD had it either.. It's not a big deal, but that opening was one of my favorite studio logos when I was a kid.

Sadly, Jamie Lee Curtis did not take part in the extras, which is disappointing considering that she was part of last year's Scream Factory Special Edition release of The Fog, and previous Halloween disc extras.... It could possibly be a result of a fee dispute, but I'm just guessing.. I do recall her talking about Prom Night on The Fog SE, so maybe to her, that was good enough..

Overall, despite the very minor personal cons, I think this SE is definitely worth the upgrade from any previous versions, which by the way, never had any special features, aside from the '98 Anchor Bay DVD which just had the theatrical trailer.
So I am very satisfied with this, and it was well worth the wait..",1410220800,24,2606,4.691466083150985

6478943,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"Admittely alot of my affection for Prom night is its nostalgia. It has a great late 70s look and feel to it that gives it a stellar drealike quality like Brian De Palma`s amazing horror masterpiece Carrie. Jamie Lee Curtis is stunningly gorgeous in it and it has a fun whodunnit
plot. It also has some great disco songs and dancing as well that really adds to its place in time and fun. Made before the slasher craze started it kind of has a lame looking killer unfortunately which is the films main downfall but other than that its a pretty fun slasher movie especially if you`re anything like me and has a month long October horror movie marathon annually. Its alot of fun to
throw in late at night during that time. I enjoyed the movie even more after seeing this gorgeous new blu ray transfer that brought a whole new life to it. Other highly recommended Jamie Lee slashers are obviously the great Halloween 1&2, Terror Train and the extremely underrated Blue Steel.",1460851200,,970,4.548571428571429
6478944,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"Starring then scream-queen (and current yogurt peddler) Jamie Lee Curtis and a pre-goofball Leslie Nielsen, ""Prom Night"" is one of the first in what would be many holiday-themed slasher flicks meant to capitalize on the success of John Carpenter's seminal ""Halloween."" The concept is at once simple and yet convoluted: a gaggle of tweens playing a rather odd and slightly sadistic ""hide and go seek""-type game in an abandoned warehouse accidentally drive another child to their death. Because it's always a good idea in this sort of movie, the kids all vow never to speak a word of this to anyone. Fast-forward six years later, and the kids are now teenagers getting ready for their prom. Only somebody saw what happened that fateful day, and somebody is going to make them pay.

Like its fellow brethren in ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""Prom Night"" is a low-budget production straight out of Canada. Director Paul Lynch works the meager concept into a rather sleek and efficient blaze of tension, bloodshed and disco. For better or worse, not much blood is shed until about 2/3 of the way through the movie. For at least the first half of the movie, we are treated to a lot of obscene phone calls, botched hook-ups in locker rooms and student-on-student pranks. There's also adequate time to set-up the somewhat stock characters, which is handled surprisingly well. Jamie Lee Curtis sticks out from the bunch as the innocent by-stander who, before becoming the de-facto survivor girl, gets to bust out in an obscenely long dance-number that almost gives a similar scene in ""Airplane"" a run for its money. The kill scenes are then, somewhat ironically, less memorable than all the stuff that comes before it, which is perhaps a testament to Lynch's unheralded skill or maybe just dumb luck.

Either way, ""Prom Night"" is a great example of the '80s slasher. All the tropes you've come to expect -- revenge, premarital relations, bratty teens, recreational drug-use -- it's all here. Perhaps not as refined as its predecessors, ""Prom Night"" remains an entertaining and somewhat endearing experience all these years later. It even inspired a pair of silly yet throroughly entertaining sequels in ""Prom Night II: Hello Mary Lou"" and ""Prom Night III: The Last Kiss,"" along with a somewhat forgettable fourth film and an absolute piece of garbage remake. But if you're looking to hit the dance floor with a well-worn semi-classic of its era, you couldn't pick a better date than the original ""Prom Night.""

After being released on DVD in various shades of terrible, the Synapse Blu-Ray set finally gets it right. If you've ever seen this film prior to this release, you know that the film itself has always looked like something that sat in a dumpster on many a hot afternoon. Time and care has been taken to restore not only the picture but the soundtrack as well. The print is polished just right -- it still retains that dream-like haze that makes the film stick out -- and it feels like a small miracle that the scenes at night are even visible at all. It's also packed with a slew of illuminating special features and retrospective interviews from just about every survivor of the film, sans Curtis. If you own an Echo Bridge DVD release of this film, kick it to the curb immediately and take a dance with the good folks at Synapse. You won't be sorry.",1458345600,2,3345,4.81391304347826

See Jamie Lee in one of her first ""Scream Queen"" roles showing off her cleavage in several shots.

Look for a few actresses that played some of the roles in the movie like that of ""Kelly"", Marybeth Rubens who I thought was really nice looking.
We didn't get to see Jamie Lee herself in the special features talking about the movie, but she was mentioned more than once and I believe she talks about Prom Night in the features on ""The Fog"" movie Blu-ray.

6478965,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"Ah, the proto-slasher- although released one month after Friday the 13th, it was obviously developed before the release of the ""original,"" 80's slasher, and therefore falls into the proto-slasher category. A lower body count, a greater emphasis on the back story and mystery behind the murders, and much more character development (comparatively). It's a fantastic film and is always a joy to watch, especially on Blu-Ray. As a tip, look for the soundtrack online- all the songs feature in the film were written specifically for the movie, and they're actually halfway decent, with some nice tongue-in-cheek offerings like ""Time to turn around,"" and ""Love me till I die.""

6478975,5,B00LBFFR2Y,"I have to be honest, PROM NIGHT not my favourite slasher film down the bottom of the list for me
HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13TH & A NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST a probably among my favourite's
the first time i saw this film was on DVD released by Anchor bay over 10 years ago now
what i remember watching about the film was how boring the plot/storyline was
it Definitely dragged on for the first 45mins of the film, i was thinking where's this film going
the film goes for 93mins including credits so the kill scenes don't start until the last 45mins really
the kill scenes are Very very Good for early slasher Horror, but the storyline is not.
the plot is simple and ridiculous
Jamie lee curtis plays the Prom Queen and her brother Alex in the film is the masked murderer
going around killing the teenagers that teased and bullied Alex's other sister Robin that was accidentally killed
when she was a child,
in the last scene before the credits roll,
Alex gets captured & stabbed at the High school Prom Dance night with Jamie lee curtis character trying to hug him
pulling of his mask, Alex shout's out Robin a few times and then the credits come up
very ridiculous storyline i didn't think much of this film when i first watched it
i've seen better slasher film's with much better plot/storylines than Prom night
it's a matter of opinion really, some fans will love it, some fans won't think much of it.

PROM NIGHT was released in 1980
and Synapse fims has given this film a special edition blu-ray release
with a new HD transfer 1:78:1 Widescreen incredible transfer aswell Hardly no Grain shows
and a new 5.1 Master audio surround sound has been given
so the picture quality and Audio does look amazing for a very low budget 80's slasher

Synapse films have also produced some new special features
 a new 40min featurette THE HORRORS OF HAMILTON HIGH
with interviews from some of the cast from the film, except Jamie lee curtis of course
and Leslie nielson who passed away some years ago now
Director Paul Lynch & screen writer William Gray are interviewed giving their recollections on the making of the film
some of the Prom night victims from the film have been interviewed
and the Actor who played the Killer Alex is also interviewed
Paul Zaza is interviewed for his music score on the film
a new Audio commentary by Director Paul Lynch, interesting commentary
he talks about the scenes and gives his recollections of filming them back in 1980
there is also Additional scenes that were added for the TV broadcast in the 80's
there's outtakes and still Gallery

so whether your a big fan of this early 80's slasher film
or don't mind it and just curious to watch it anyway
get this new special edition blu-ray from synapse films worth the money for sure
time to throw out the old Anchor bay release, Definitely time for an Upgrade
i gave 5 stars for this blu-ray based on the massive extras and a beautiful transfer
only 3 stars for the film itself.",1413763200,5,2946,4.5423728813559325

In particular, Wendy's stalking scene. She is running through very dark school corridors & in the Special Edition I can actually see the surroundings rather than just a dark picture---that was worth the price of dvd alone!!! Also, the bonus featurette with cast members was a welcome surprise. It had behind the scenes info that was new to me & seeing familiar faces from cast members was awesome ( MaryBeth Reubens, Joy Thompson & Michael Tough were the highlights for me).

6478982,5,B00LBFFR2Y,"First let me say that this movie has never looked better. I saw this in the theater back in 1980, and as a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis it is a guilty pleasure (I even like the cheesy disco music and that even cheesier song that plays over the end credits ""Fade to Black""). For the most part the extras are great. The making of doc with interviews with several members of the cast, the TV footage, and outtakes were so fun to watch. But I have to say this Blu-ray contains what has to be the worst commentary track ever put on disc. I can forgive that they mistakenly mention that Eve Plumb was the star of Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (it was Linda Blair), but when they mistake the young Kim character with the young Wendy character and say that Kim was ""morally culpable"" for the whole thing I just couldn't take it any more. Does the director and screenwriter not know their own movie?",1411948800,,887,4.285714285714286
6478983,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"Despite borrowing heavily from Halloween and Carrie (plus healthy smidge of Saturday Night Fever), and despite the relatively slow 45 minutes or so after the beginning, Prom Night has managed to carve out (pun intended) and hold its place as a classic in the slasher flick category . . . and I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps it's because it stars the original scream queen, Jamie Lee Curtis, who just added credence to any movie she starred in, and let's face it, she was a ""star"" and is a pop culture icon of the 70's and 80's and I hope she's still raking in the royalties from all of her projects. Perhaps its the charm of the late 70's atmosphere that has kept this movie around--the disco music and dancing are fun and nostalgic & I swear I wish I could download the title track to my iPod (LOL). Whatever the reason, Prom Night has endured and is here to stay and this Synapse Blu-ray version is gorgeous both visually and acoustically. The four stars are for this entire Synapse, Blu-ray package of Prom Night; the movie itself is just above three stars--which is ""good"" and, certainly, its worth viewing.",1411689600,,1113,4.57
6478984,5,B00LBFFR2Y,"Nice transfer and lots of extras make for a nice bundle on this edition of Prom Night.  For avid fans, they pretty much get everything here but the kitchen sink.  Included are cast interviews and insight that make for a fun viewing.  One highlight is the humorous audio commentary by filmmakers who carry on like school girls as they giggle often when reminiscing about their production.  Worth the price and the time if you want to revisit this 80's horror cult fave.",1411516800,,468,4.670731707317073

Prom Night is about a group of kids who accidentally murder their young friend and they decide to keep it a secret. Years later, as they get ready for prom so is someone else... FOR MURDER! Alright, not the most original film and not even the greatest but it is definitely a fun film! You are not going to expect a big budget film but what you can expect is an okay film that doesn't disappoint. Some of it drags on but the murders are definitely worth it and the hilarious scene where Jamie Lee Curtis starts dancing.

6478987,5,B00LBFFR2Y,"Prom Night"" Is another of my favorite retro Slashers.
I love the disco soundtrack especially the Title track 'Prom Night"" It's a great example of the late Seventies/1980 Disco craze .It's like going back in a time machine. The characters are pretty well developed as we see them go from children to high school teenagers.

Ever since I saw Halloween I craved more Jamie lee Curtis in a horror role and Prom Night gives you a healthy dose of both. It is light on gore save one good decapitation scene, although there is a good amount of blood. But it still holds up as Slasher Royalty.

The Blu ray transfer was nicely done as were the extras and the sound was amazing. I am always pleased when a classic comes on Blu Ray and this certainly is no exception.it is both suspenseful and will have you empathizing with the killer.

A must for any collector.",1411257600,,852,4.483870967741935

8664968,2,B00LBFFR2Y,"I am sorry to disagree with the overall ratings for this movie but I need to be honest. I bough this item because I remembered it from my childhood. TV shows and movies from childhood often have nostalgic value which makes them enjoyable even the TV show/movie is not as great as you remembered it to be. I love classic 80s slasher movies (Halloween and Friday the 13th are my favorites). However, in my opinion, Prom Night 1980 fails as a slasher. It begins very promising and I must say the child actors in the opening scenes are probably better than some of the adult actors later in the picture. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The mysterious shadow looms over the accidentally murdered victim and then we are 10 years in to the future. My biggest problem with the movie is the murder scenes are flat and not effective. The first murder is a slow-motion scene where the murderer puts his hand on the victim's mouth from behind and we get to see the to--be victim's eyes; it just doesn't feel realistic, as I don't think a victim would just look terrified in what appears to be an extended point of time. I think she would at least put her hand out or try to get the hand away from her mouth. But I think the 2nd murder is even less effective. A couple is inside the van, and then suddenly the doors of the van open, you see the murderer in a brief second and the woman is already lying on her back almost dead, as if she died instantly (nobody dies instantly like that especially with no convulsion or movement), as we watch the murderer continue to stab her throat(?). I am not much for bloody gore scenes. I could do without them. But if they are part of a slasher then they'd better be done right. In this movie, the first two murder scenes were not done right. And I don't think the climax on the dance floor works either. Something about the disco music and the dance floor, they don't create the tense atmosphere a slasher requires. As for the blu-ray, HD transfer is very good, both video and audio. There are quite a few extras including feature commentary. If you are already familiar with this film, then go ahead and buy it. But if you vaguely remember it, don't be deceived thinking that it is  a cult classic. The overall premise is good but the flaws in the execution of some of the scenes prevent the film from being great.",1499040000,2,2330,4.393518518518518

8664974,4,B00LBFFR2Y,"I saw this film at the drive-in. My sister & I and group of friends saw this film along with the movie ""Don't Go In The House"". Well I loved the film when I was kid and I still like it now its now I have seen all the other films this movie stole from. This film is equal parts ""Halloween"" ""Psycho"" and ""Carrie"" however those films are superior.

In this film a 10 year old girl dies when she playing a twisted little game with a group of friends. A innocent man Leonard Murch gets convicted of the crime. 6 years later on Prom Night we learn the man has escaped and out for revenge.

Now SPOILERS AHEAD When we see who the killer is there is a few things I learned from the actor himself who played the role. If you have only seen this film on DVD you are seeing a poor transfer of the film. For years people have debated on what on his lips! Well some of thought it was lipstick and others thought is was blood. Well the actor told me himself it is LIPSTICK. Alex morphed into Robin to kill off the right people who were responsible for the death of Robin. He told me ""He even now stutters like Robin"" Now there is a throw away line when Kim's (Jamie Lee Curtis) mother is looking for her lipstick. This is the lipstick the killer has on at the end. The Blu-Ray Disc however has a far better picture than the old DVD.

This is still a fun film to watch. The Cheesy Dance Sequence is good a for a few laughs. I just wish the 2008 film ""Prom Night"" would of been a true remake and not just share the same title.",1471305600,,1510,4.026666666666666
