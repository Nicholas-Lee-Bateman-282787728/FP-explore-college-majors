belter in the Bessie Smith tradition; ""Old fashion love"", ""Ain't somebody got the blues"". Through out the show's; Troup
gives his opinion's on Jazz history etc. The cartoon commercials are Jazz oriented, with the voice of Dick LeGrande
(Mr Peavy fame;The Great Gildersleeve radio show.)  The sound and picture is C- in my opinion. It was still worth it for
me to own this DVD. I enjoyed ALL of the music here. 82 minutes.",1277424000,7,976,5.506666666666667
