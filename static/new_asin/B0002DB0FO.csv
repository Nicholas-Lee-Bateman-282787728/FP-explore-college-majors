2078146,5,B0002DB0FO,"After the sudden death of a wife and mother in a car accident, a grieving family moves to a small town in the mountains not knowing a thing what to expect. The father and doctor opens a free clinic in the town's old and abandoned train station where cases of a pastor with hives, to children have sex, a gay father who is cheating on his wife, a teenage piano player who is pregnant from her teacher, to the town's all-star athlete who lies in a coma, and a beautiful meighbor who come to his door. And he must deal with his grieving son and daughter who are trying to fit into their new home and are trying to deal with the unique occurrences in their lives. And to top it all off, the son meets the girl of his dreams who uses this factor to get him to talk his father into operating on her boyfriend who happens to be the town's all-star and comatose athlete.

This show is backed up with a powerful cast along with amazing actor Treat Williams as the grieving Dr. Andy Brown. The story line and each episode is cleverly written and narrorated which adds even more to the heart warming drama. It is very believable and life like in the fact it deals with everyday events and not so everyday events. The season premiere and finale were everything they should be; perfect and left the audience wanting more. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this clever series which can only get better.",1092009600,5,1381,4.352713178294573
2078147,5,B0002DB0FO,"I remember hearing about this show before it aired, What I was told is that ""It is about a grieving family greving the loss of their mother and moving to a new envirnoment""

 When I heard what it was about and after watching the Pilot episode. I could totaly relate to the lead actor playing the son and the family as well because I was about the lead son's age when my father suddenly died. So I loved how there was a show that can totally show what I went through. The only difference I find not real was the fact that the father of the show is so rich, he doesn't even charge his patients for his practice. I find that a little unrealistic because majority of widows out there are not millionares. Anyway I enjoyed watching the chemistry of ""The Browns"" the most because I found a show that you can really relate to. I'll be buying this DVD on the release date.",1091664000,3,864,4.2303030303030305

2078150,5,B0002DB0FO,"this is a magical drama that gives you the feeling of curling up by the fire with a warm drink and a good book. the characters struggle through the undeniable hardship of losing the beloved mother of ephram and delia, julia brown. her husband andy, a workaholic doctor, is grief-stricken and makes a split-second decision to relocate the family from the bustle of new york city to a small town that julia had once seen when her train got delayed as a child. everwood, colorado brings the brown family into a small world complete with its own trials and tribulations. amy abbott's struggling with the injury of her comatose boyfriend, and yet somehow she and ephram collide, helping each other, and ultimately getting hurt. this is an amazingly intelligent, thought-provoking show unlike any other.",1088812800,6,797,4.955223880597015
2078151,5,B0002DB0FO,"This series, which just finished it's second season on the WB network, is the perfect mix of comedy, drama, characters, and storylines.  The show its self is about a family (the Browns) that move from New York City to the small town of Everwood after the passing of their mother.
From creator Greg Berlantini, comes a powerful series, that at first explores how a family must come to gripes with the death of a love one, but eventually evolves into a dramedy about getting on with one's life, with the beautiful Colorado Back Drop.
One of the best things Everwood has going for it is it's very talented cast.  Treat Williams plays Dr. Andy Brown, Gregory Smith plays Ethram, Emily VanCamp plays Amy Abbott, while John Beasley, Tom Amandes, and Chris Pratt fill in the supporting cast.  Not to mention the amazing Debra Mooney, who plays the tuff-as-nails Grandmother to the Abbott Clan.
Over the course of the 23-episode first season, the show manly surrounds the ongoing story of Collin Heart, a boy who was put into a comma after a car accident.  But the overall arc of the season is not what makes this show so specail, its the stand-alone episodes which provide positive information on many subjects families should talk about but don't: Teen Drinking, Pregnancy, Abortion, Dieing Family Members, and so on.
Once again Warner Brothers had put together an amazing set of episodes from an ubelievably wonderful show, complamented by special features (4 commentaries, deleted scenes, and behind-the-scenes featurrettes).  Also recamended ""Gilmore Girls - The Complete First SEason.""",1086825600,68,1583,5.026717557251908

Good clean family series that were on AaTV years ago are not available for streaming under Amazon Prime Membership??? Why.

This poor review is for the ""watch free with ads"" bait and switch. The series title page for season one leads one to believe that the whole season is available to watch free with ads.

She is ugly, a complete and CONSTANT BROODING DOWNER, and she's iIN LOVE, to the point of stalking, with a different guy every month.  Her entire life is devoted to each guy and school and family suddenly aren't important when she decides to glom onto one guy or another.  I certainly hope we are supposed to hate her and this poor character (Ephram) wizes up pretty quickly and gets sick of her feelings getting hurt, making her stomp out at ANYTHING and EVERYTHING the poor guy says,  or I won't be able to stand watching another season!  This can't possibly be an average A student teenage girl.  I know better!  Meanwhile single neurosurgeon Dad is ignoring the people that give him the good advice while following all of the bad advice to the detriment of himself and his family.

Everwood had been such a treat weekly, that we bought the videos after it was dropped.  The last season video tapes, however, did not play.

When I saw Everwood was available through Amazon, and with television programming such a wasteland this summer, it seemed the perfect filler for our ""before bed time-after the sun finally goes down in the north woods"" time.

The characters are remarkable and their interplay so intelligent; there's usually a laugh or a tear in every episode.  If you've never seen it, now's your chance.  But watch it from the beginning.",1402272000,,686,4.754237288135593
2078284,5,B0002DB0FO,"This set cost the most, but for good reason. In my opinion, it had the best Everwood episodes and storylines (mainly with Colin) in it. Season 2 was very good, too, but after Hannah was introduced the series started going downhill. I still recommend seeing all of the episodes, and the last 2 seasons (3 and 4) are pretty cheap, and I think worth the money.

The only gripe I have is the case for this one: Very bulky for 6 discs or so. It has a nice leaflet describing most of the episodes, commentaries for select episodes. The case actually fell apart on me, but it was probably because of age. I recommend a disc wallet or sleeves to protect and store these discs.

They tackled some serious issues: drunk driving that results in the loss of a popular teenager and teen sex and pregnancies with just the right amount of education and tact. The only thing that bothered me was Treat Williams.  He is a good actor but not convincing as Dr. Brown, the famous neurosurgeon. A suit-wearing doctor from NYC doesn't suddenly wear jeans and carry a back pack. To be honest, with the unattractive beard, he wasn't convincing as a love interest either but beyond that Everwood is a quality show.",1383523200,,642,4.783783783783784

2078343,4,B0002DB0FO,"A few years ago, I was watching a very forgettable movie on cable, so forgettable in fact, that I can't even remember the name of it. This film did however have a tremendous teen actor, who I took note of, because of the charisma and intensity that he brought to his role. I thought this kid could one day be a big star and took note of his name, Gregory Smith. Since then I have become a huge Gregory Smith fan, seeing most of his films and now his TV show, Everwood. The story of Everwood begins when world famous neurosurgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams), loses his wife in a car accident. Distraught, Brown decides to leave his prestigious job and move his family from New York City to the small town of Everwood, Colorado, where he opens up a free medical clinic. Brown was a brilliant surgeon, but really doesn't have a clue about how to be a father. His children, in particular his son Ephram (Gregory Smith), does not make the transition easy on him. To be honest, this isn't the kind of show that I usually go for and I was only planning on watching a couple of episodes. A couple of episodes quickly turned into much more as this infectious group of people really drew me into their lives and touched me in a way that a TV show never has. Part of me could really relate to their personal struggles and attempts at overcoming the adversity they faced, if nothing else, It was empowering and inspirational. Veteran actor, Treat Williams, leads a truly terrific cast, playing the man whose turned his life upside down in order to get closer to his children. Dr. Brown is supposed to be the one who has all the answers, at the hospital, that may be true, but at home, it's a big learning curve for him. The dynamic between this quirky celebrity doctor and his introverted, yet artistic outcast son, is really the heart of this show. Gregory Smith is off the charts good as young Ephram Brown, who possesses many of the same qualities as his father. Those qualities are usually at odds with the qualities of his mother, causing him to be a bit impulsive and quick to speak his mind. Ephram quickly falls for the most popular girl in school, Amy Abbott (Emily Van Camp), who is the daughter of Everwood's first family. Amy clearly has feeling for Ephram, but a shocking secret that keeps her from getting close to him. Van Camp, now the star of ABC's Revenge, is asked to wear many hats, sometimes she's sweet and innocent, while at other times she's immature and irritating. but no matter the mood, she's always at the top of her game, really letting you feel, what Amy is feeling. Amy's father is Dr. Harold Abbott (Tom Amandes) who was the only doctor in Everwood, until Dr. Brown showed up. Abbott is arrogant, egocentric, and absolutely hysterical. Amandes brings some much needed comic relief to the show and his interactions with the other members of the cast are priceless. If it wasn't for Everwood being a WB show, Tom Amandes would have several Emmy Awards by now, because he really is that good. Everwood is a family drama that is at times hard to watch, because you will be deeply affected by these characters and at some point will be able to personally relate to what their going through. It pulls at the heart strings, that's for sure, but seeing that adversities faced by these characters and how they were able to over come them is really an inspiration. I said earlier that this is the kind of show that I don't usually watch, but it should be for the way it made me think and the way it made me feel.",1371168000,3,3530,4.46594427244582

2078355,5,B0002DB0FO,Everwood was a widely under appreciated show when it was on the air. I count myself as one of the lucky ones that watched this show from the beginning. Season one of this series was beautifully written set against one of the most beautiful back drops in television history. This is a character driven drama that has many intense emotional moments but also offers plenty of humor that helps makes this show easy and fun to watch.

I have watched the entire series, season one through season four and have become totally immersed in it.  Really great character development.  You could see the misteps of the characters and relate to their experiences.  As I got involved in it, I kept hoping for the major characters to get together and as it turned out, they did.  Some of those high points were worth watching over and over again.  Everwood is truly an amazing series, probably the best series I have ever watched, bar none!",1365638400,,608,4.626168224299065

All the characters seem to be hypersensitive.  There are lots of hurt feelings and pouting.  None of the characters can keep a secret.  If one characters tells another a secret in deepest confidence, you can expect that in the next episode the recipient of the confidential communication will blab inappropriately to someone else, and that will set off another round of hurt feelings and pouting.  There are endless rounds of love triangles, romantic breakups and reconciliations.  There is a lot of death and mourning.  Lastly, the set decoration is excessive.  The homes of the principal characters all look like the painters and decorators just left and they are waiting for the photographers from House Beautiful.

The problem is that these ""pages"" of heavy plastic are only attached by a single strip is super cheap glue. After flipping through them once, they all fell out of the case and the overall presentation is ruined as a result.

Of course, this has nothing to do with the playability of the TV show, but it is something that is just put together very cheaply.

There are opportunities to discuss the multifaceted moral dilemmas between the dialog or episode pauses.
I plan on watching this with my preteen sons when they are in high school and old enough to comprehend the impact of the choices considered and acted upon.

The preacher and wife get divorced then he goes blind... It got depressing after awhile for me.

2078408,5,B0002DB0FO,"Okay, Everwood characters such as Dr. Brown may on rare occasions get a tad preachy.  But only rarely.  Otherwise, this a fine ensemble cast, with a reasonable amount of angst, great wilderness and small town locations, plenty of family and school drama, and content that is perfectly okay for older kids, say middle school aged, to view with or without their parents in the room.

Treat Williams is appealing as the aforementioned NY doctor who moves to a tiny town after his wife's death.  The biggest challenge for him is raising his young daughter and teenage son, the latter one filled with bitterness about being forced to move and rightfully angry with his dad for hardly having been home in the earlier years.  This of course leads to much confrontation, arguing, blame, and guilt, which makes for great scenes of conflict.  The easier kid, Delia, is a delight to watch.  The rival doctor is a real stealer of scenes, while the woman playing his toughp-as-nails mother is usually fun as well.  There's also a neighbor who has to raise her son alone and can connect with Dr. B. on that level, while Ephram must deal with his feelings for the gentle Amy, who is torn between him and her comatose lover, Colin.  Her brother, Bright, isn't very...bright. But he's okay in his way.

Although some people may not agree with all the stands that are taken on some of the issues (because these issues are definitely a part of the episodes), you will still find each episode interesting.

2078435,5,B0002DB0FO,"This Season was awesome... the total serie is great... good libretto, in few words is a serie that show the life in a similar perspective",1251936000,,137,4.52
2078436,5,B0002DB0FO,"First, I have to take issue with the office review, which compares EVERWOOD to NORTHERN EXPOSURE and PICKET FENCES. Both of those shows had a touch of surreality that plays no role on EVERWOOD. I suspect that the reviewer was thinking more in terms of the small town setting, but I would compare the show more to family dramas like ONCE AND AGAIN. Nonetheless, it is an excellent series. It could easily not be. The story of a newly widowed big city brain surgeon relocating to a small Colorado town to start over with his young daughter and teen-aged son could easily descend into something trite and melodramatic, but EVERWOOD manages to avoid clich and present a group of believable and likable characters. Moreover, Everwood itself takes on the feel of a place that you come to know and like. While I would still prefer to visit Cicely, Alaska more than Everwood, but it runs a close second.

Watching the show made me appreciate more Greg Berlanti and his skills as a producer. I've enjoyed his work on BROTHERS AND SISTERS and absolutely loved ELI STONE (easily my favorite of the shows he has worked on). He has a real knack for creating characters and situations that are involving and that make you care about what will happen next. And I like that for the most part he avoids ""a very special episode of EVERWOOD."" Even in the episode that deals with an eighteen-year-old girl getting an abortion, he does not sensationalize it. He doesn't make anything about that episode glib or easy, and even has a couple of surprising twists. But neither does he play it up for any cheap thrills. Furthermore, just the nerve to show an abortion on a TV show is pretty amazing in these hyper-politicized days. About 99% of the time on television a pregnant teen ends up having a miscarriage. Similarly, in an episode where a woman thinks her husband has had an affair with another woman, she learns that it was, instead, a man.

The cast is solid enough. Everyone is at least competent, while a few are extremely appealing. Treat Williams is great in the lead as brain surgeon turned small town doctor. I also really enjoy Emily Vancamp in the show. I didn't know that she was in the show, but I enjoyed her a lot on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, where she plays the least mess up person in the larger Walker family. Even in this show, as a teen of around 16 or 17, she already showed a great deal of appeal. Some actors just radiate likability and she has that in spades.

I'm really delighted to discover this series. I missed it the first time it was on the air, but I had always heard good things about it (several TV critics I read lamented that the new CW opted for renewing ONE TREE HILL rather than EVERWOOD). I've never seen ONE TREE HILL (though I've heard very little good about it so I doubt if I will ever be tempted), but the first season of this show truly makes me regret that they didn't keep it instead.",1251676800,,2909,4.495274102079395

Upon examination, I found that the inside spine of the binding had printing (and clay coating) on it. No wonder the glue failed to adhere. After removing the coating with sandpaper and applying hot glue, the package was ready for gifting. Did not realize that 'some assembly is required.'",1244160000,,450,4.5

2078439,5,B0002DB0FO,I TOTALLY enjoyed the Everwood series and was sooo bummed when it ended. A while ago I happened across the theme song on emusic and downloaded it. Every time I heard it on my MP3 player I yearned to see the show again. I found the first season on DVD here at Amazon and promptly ordered it. I was so contented to sit down and view the pilot show again. I'm just looking for my next chance to sit down and enjoy the whole first season show by show again. My ONLY regret is so far I have not seen the 2nd season out to buy!! I feel like a kid with my enjoyment factor and I am 50! :),1231632000,,581,3.85
2078440,5,B0002DB0FO,"When Everwood came out on the WB I was certain it was the best thing on TV.  The show is filled with endearing, multi-dimensional characters whose interactions produce a fabulous viewing experience.  It's effects span the emotions and gives the viewer ""that feeling"" you get when a movie or show is emotionally satisfying and also somewhat profound.

***Spoiler alert here for those who have only seen season 1*** As for those who are craving seasons 2-4, I say let it go.  The first season was amazing, and it was the show's peak.  Let's face it, the primary conflict is about Ephram and Amy who kind of want to get together but are conflicted by Colin's presence, or lack thereof.  Once Colin is no longer in a coma the whole dynamic of the show, and the characters' ability to interact changes.  The writers get desperate, the show goes downhill.  Be glad Season 1 is out.  It's AMAZING.  And just hold onto the good times.",1231459200,,926,4.625766871165644
2078441,5,B0002DB0FO,"Everwood is one of those continuing series type of shows, much like a soap opera would be, except more sophisticated.  And, it is one of my favorites.  When I realized that it had come out on DVD, it brought back such warm memories just to think of it that I knew it must have been a very pleasant viewing experience.  It's not fast-paced or flashy, but frankly, that's what I liked about it.  It's family situations with introspection and a few surprises, and nicely done by all.",1224892800,,480,4.482758620689655

The actors were simply born for these roles. In particular, I love Tom Amandes as Dr. Abbot!! He is just priceless. But I suppose one could say that about all the characters in a little town called Everwood. It's full of heart, its human, its love, its beautiful.

So turn off all the nonsense and mind-numbing dribble currently inhabiting TV land and get yourself a train  ticket to Everwood.

2078461,5,B0002DB0FO,"I've been holding off on this review for a while because frankly I can't begin to express how good this show is. One of my favorite shows of all time has been ""The Wonder Years"" and I'm starting to think that Everwood is even better. The Characters are deep. The Drama is excellent but not over bearing with a wonderful balance of humor at just the right moments. And the story's are wonderful without being afraid to tackle issues of the day. Buying it is a no brainier now that its only Nineteen Ninety Nine. The only problem is there is very little known about whether the last 3 seasons are coming out anytime soon. So If you get hooked good luck trying to find those episodes. *wink* Really I can't tell you how good it is your going to have to see for yourself and really at the price of a newly released movie could you really pass up the chance of a at least what you can consider a wonderful 17 hour mini-series.",1210723200,,921,4.268571428571429
2078462,5,B0002DB0FO,"Hi folks:

Here is my review of EVERWOOD (All four seasons, not just season one).

What a wonderful treasure, indeed. A family show that has it all: courage, compassion, love, heart-ache, heart-break, heart-on-the-mend, heart-happy, culture, religion (Jewish/Christian harmony), adventure in all its glorious forms, small town/big town dichotomy, conflict, upheaval, shock, depression, trials of the youth, difficulties of middle-age, and the wisdom of the elderly. All these come together in four fabulous seasons of Everwood TV. The first season will have you flying through a range of emotions and asking many questions about the world and how it works.

Do yourself a favor and buy this fabulous work of art. It will keep on giving the more you watch it. Now, the rest is up to you. Buy this wonderful show, watch it, and then come back here and leave your reviews.

There is something in this show for everybody.

Cheers,

2078485,2,B0002DB0FO,"I had high hopes for this series after all I'd read and heard, but found it to be disappointing.  The premise of the story is good.  I pretty easily was able to get into the plot and care about the characters, and can see why Everwood has its following.

BUT, there is so much not to like.  For one--the narrating.  It's corny, it's trying to be philosophical, trying to make this show into something greater than it is.  It's a bore.  I hear that they ditched it in future seasons.

Second--and my biggest criticism--it's clear that the writers had an agenda from the start.  Just in season one alone, they covered ""safe"" sex, surrogate motherhood, medical marijuana, [...], and abortion.  These things weren't touched on subtely.  They were thrown in your face, all with a far left slant, with the possible exception of abortion, where both doctors struggled with it.  But wouldn't you know, the more conservative of the two actually performs it.  Yet another statement made.

Third, there is not enough humor, and what little there is, usually isn't that funny.

The relationships are very soap-like--on one day, off the next.  It was exhausting trying to keep up, and became something of a frustration.  I ended up hoping Amy stayed with Colin, and Ephram with Laney, but finally in the end, I ceased to care anymore.  And this, just after the first season!  I know they dragged that saga out for the duration of the series.

The acting is only average for TV, which isn't good.  Treat Williams was especially substandard.  I thought the best was the actor who played Bright.  There are some very likeable characters, which is pretty much what kept me watching.  But some characters were exaggerated to the point of being comical, while others were understated.  It was hard to get a feel for the tone of the series.

It took me awhile to build up empathy for Ephram, who was incredibly rebellious and mouthy.  Call me old school, but I don't think, even in his situation, he had reason to yell and cuss like that at his dad.  That, along with the liberal slant to all social issues, made me wonder why on earth this is considered a family show.

Season 1 ends with a heavy duty cliffhanger involving Colin, and no further seasons were sold on DVD.  I've been told that Season 1 was the best, so if that's the case, I don't see much reason to invest any more time in this series.",1176336000,9,2383,4.59144893111639

In reality, there are absolutely no special features on the discs except the commentaries on 4 edisodes.  I consider this a rip-off because the special features are not included.

Both my husband and I agreed that it was the most entertaining family drama we had ever seen in forty years of TV watching.  Everwood has everything but violence: comedy, romance, sorrow, joy, confusion, and teen angst.  The writing is imaginative and coherent; we never had a problem following the storyline.  The show is superb, and, unlike many TV series, it remains so to the end of Season 4.  The characters are so real and so likable that you want to invite them to your home for dinner.  Sometimes you want to hug them, and other times you are REALLY disgusted with them, but you never want to turn them off.

We bought the Season 1 DVD set.  It is the only DVD of a TV series that we own.  We would prepay a premium price to own the second, third, and fourth seasons.  They are classics.

A father and husband who is not home very often a day, because he works very long and doesn't see the problems which occur. He hasn't been a good father and husband. All this changed then because of a big tragedy.

Andy Brown decides to move to Everwood, Colorado, because his wife told him once. His son Ephrem is in his puberty and not quit happy about the change. For his daughter Delia can Andy be the father she alway wanted and always loved.

As the story progresses Andy and Ephrem go through big difficulties and are more bound together. Andy never told his son why they had to move and Ephrem never understood, but then Andy does.

excuse my terrible english...I'm from Germany.

So many people liked watching (and buying) the first series of EVERWOOD.

Most of them (me too) are starving to see the following seasons.

Why is it so hard to put the following season(s) on the market?

O.K., EVERWOOD isn't really the concept of todays smashing TV-Series, but look at the reviews here...no bad one.

Everybody who saw this fabulous show was faszinating on the warmhearted story, the nice characters and the respectful humour.

I don't want to put to many text here, but EVERWOOD has worldwide fangroup hoping that the rest this series will come soon.

In my opion all fans will pay a higher price to get this following seasons.

So, my dear producers, what are you saying? It is deal for you (money) and it is a deal for us (enjoying the most loveable show ever(wood))...

I hope you will see this review and take it under advice.

best regards from one really big fan

It did not dissappoint in anyway and was well worth the buy.  Well thought out, superb cast who gave charisma, energy, heart and emotion and who made this show so real to watch.

It also introduces what will be the main romantic arc of the show; the courtship dance between Ephram and Amy Abbott. Supporting characters do precisely that; they support the SHOW and not just serve as window dressing for the main characters. All characters feels like they natuarlly belong in this story and that the story would be incomplete without them. The show only got better in later seasons.

2078622,4,B0002DB0FO,"""Everwood""'s first season is already almost classic. It is highly unlikely you haven't heard about this show, but just in case that happened I'll tell you some things about the plot, so you can decide whether this is the kind of show you might like.

Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams) is a highly successful neurosurgeon that has neglected his family in order to take care of his patients. But reality crashes down on him when his wife (Brenda Strong) dies in an accident. He doesn't know what to do, and, in the spur of the moment, decides to move with his two children to Everwood, a little town in Colorado that his wife had loved when they saw it for the first time, a long time before her death.

Leaving the big city and becoming a small town doctor will mean many changes Andrew, but even more for his teenager son Ephram (Gregory Smith), and his young daughter, Delia (Vivien Cardone), that have to leave their friends and everything they know in order to move to a strange city. What it is worse, they are not accustomed to actually spending time with their father, and miss their mother a lot...

Will the Brown's become a real family? And will they find their place in the world in Everwood? These are some of the questions that this first season begins to answer, and the reason why you should watch this dvd. ""Everwood"" has a little bit of everything, drama and comedy, and specially that kind of moments that make a series stand out. Recommended!

Without falling into a slump, Everwood remained fresh and new. It was always interesting and always relevent. I appreciated the range of actors, even having Irv and Edna, two characters in the senior citizen age group, playing key and pivital roles. This show was a true gem, a diamond in the rough, if you will. I signed petitions and even e-mailed the new CW president, Dawn Ostroff, but it was to no avail. I really hope the station knows what it missed out on. I've seen letter after letter in the newspapers and other publications asking why this show was cancelled. I don't understand, it seems as if the show had supporters, so why flush this gem for the resurrection of the horrid, past it's experation date, 7th Heaven? I guess I'll never understand how good television gets left in the dust while smut, trash, and sheer idiocy continues to reign.

2078679,5,B0002DB0FO,"Everwood is full of a type of magic that is hard to explain, and even more difficult to find on conventional TV these days. The show contains an amazing of realistic banter between its stars, yet has enough great moments to truly make a dent in your mind. It's a show that can be ""enjoyed by all ages."" Yes, that statement is trite, but it's never been more true for a single show. The adults face real problems and don't always do the right thing. The teenagers on the show have their moments of grace, yet also fall from it as well. But in every episode, there is a the substance of a heart that carries the show to amazing heights.

  It's bittersweet, pathetic, and frustrating that the WB cancelled it. If given proper attention, such as not having it endure a hiatus, promoting it properly, and not flipping its timeslot, it could have continued to bloom. The CW should have picked it up, but of course we need more of their ""innovative"" TV. I guarantee most, if not all of their new shows will be gone in a less that a year; Pepper Dennis anyone?

  What's even sadder is the rest of the seasons won't be coming out until there is enough of a demand in terms of sales for them to warrant a release. So please support the show and try it. It's not just a bunch of kids watching it, I'm a grown man and doctor, so I'm not some burnt out kid who just watches lots of TV, I watch what really matters. I hear that many will be boycotting the new CW this fall, that's smart. I wish ABC Family would try to renew the series on their network this fall, since they're showing the reruns. It's a shame, shows like Seinfeld took time to catch on, and look at it now. Would Everwood have become Seinfeld? No. But it could have gained a more massive following with time, but I guess creative integrity can't stand up to the mighty Neilsons. The cast and show deserved better and still do, so please help support this show.

I'm going to miss this show so much and I'm am really hoping that they decide to put the rest of the seasons on DVD soon. I heard that they weren't going to because of low sales of the first season.

He immediately got the impression that Everwood was a Disney like soap that never really deals with anything in any depth.  I then described various plots in Everwood and I was surprized by the depth of the many plots.  Everwood had conflict; but no matter how deep the conflict the characters maintained a relationship with each other.  There was always something deeper that bonded the characters.  Something that, in my opinion, is terribly missing in current times.  For me, the relationships between the characters in Everwood represented the best in human relationships.  I will miss the show and while it would be easy to blame WB for pulling it, I think the failure of Everwood to find a widespread audience says more about the people in our society than it does WB.",1150156800,9,837,4.811188811188811

Why this show never found a larger audience is anyone's guess. I'm sorry CW cancelled it instead of Seventh Heaven which was long overdue to be gone.

2078709,5,B0002DB0FO,"Back in the fall of 2002 I saw the promo for a new show called ""Everwood"". The storyline intrigued me. I usually try to pick one new show per year to watch and stay with. I chose ""Everwood"" for that year. I was fed up with endless and frenetic crime, lawyer,reality, and medical shows which now grace (and saturate) our airwaves. This seemed different. The show intrigued me from the beginning. Shortly into the series I became aware that the writers of this show were doing something very clever, but I could not put my finger on it. About mid way through the series I figured it out on my way to work. The writers had worked a subtle Rockwell motif into the story. It is most explicitly seen in the opening credits during the first season. The shots of the cast are not only done in Rockwell's style but are also seen in quintessential Rockwellian settings. A clever twist- take a hip, yet disfunctional, New York family of the 21st century and plunk it down in ""fly-over country"" - the small town America of Norman Rockwell. The  motif was again alluded to, when, in a later episode, I noticed a copy of Rockwell's  ""Country Doctor"" hanging on the wall of the doctor's den. The point was then made quite explicit in the episode ""Miracle of Everwood"" when the journalist makes reference to the picture as he attempts to justify the inaccurate story he is going to publish. I was pleased to discover that in the commentary track Berlanti talks about the motif in the opening credits and how hard and expensive it was to do. Details and texture such as this can add so much to the storytelling.  Furthermore, some of the editing was of a very high quality and emulated a lot of techniques used in cinema: graphic matches, matches on action etc. Whoever chose the songs also did a very good job. The selections were not just the music popular today (also designed to sell more WB cds). Some great standards from the past were used as well, such as Etta James' ""At Last"". I have great respect for Berlanti and the writers on this show. The constraints of the medium force them to work very fast and to appeal to as big a market as possible. In such an environment it is hard to produce anything that rises above the level of schlock. Thus, it always amazes me when anything really good emerges from such a format. While I, like other fans of the show, am disappointed to see it cancelled, I have to say that the miracle is that it lasted as long as it did. Given the moronic network it was on and the minimal backing it received, we were fortunate to get four years out of it. While it was killed off undoubtedly before its time - there is one blessing. It will remain one show that never ""jumped the shark"". The idiots at CW have seen to that.",1149811200,20,2742,4.41501976284585
2078710,5,B0002DB0FO,"I watched this series from the first show to the last (which came much too soon).  It's the story of world-famous New York neurosurgeon, Dr. Andy Brown (Treat Williams), who moves with his two children to a new life in a place called Everwood, Colorado, after the tragic death of his wife.  It's completely captivating right from the start - beginning with Andy giving up the ""high life"" and opening a general practice in the (formerly) one-doctor small town and letting everyone know that his medical services will be free!

A great cast of characters, superbly acted by a wonderful group of actors.  I would recommend this show to anyone.  Everwood was by far the best series television has ever offered and I look forward to the opportunity to purchase seasons 2-4 sometime in the very near future.  If things go as they should, seasons 5 through whatever will also be available for purchase at some point.

If you've never watched, you should.  Great writing, great cast, great music, great everything.  Did I mention this show is great?  Enjoy the show and please continue the efforts to put this series back on TV where it belongs.",1149811200,9,1137,4.755102040816326
2078711,5,B0002DB0FO,"I accidentally tuned into the first episode of Everwood in 2002 and was immediately intrigued. It is not often that a show invites you to journey along as a successful man considers that the direction he is going was all wrong. As Andy uproots his family, leaves his successful neurosurgery practice in NY and heads out for Everwood Colorado, a place his recently deceased wife said that she had wished to live sometime, he slows down and realizes how much he has missed being there for his family. This is, of course, is met with mixed reviews especially by his teenaged son Ephraim. In the spirit of the move, he grows a beard and opens a free, general practice clinic much to the consternation of Everwood's only other doctor. There are tough issues this show tackles such as grief and loss during this first season that will keep you glued to your set.

I'll admit it, I didn't buy the first season when it came out (but I wasn't really buying DVD sets then either).

2078726,5,B0002DB0FO,"As I sit here and read other reviews I too have never written an online review before but just felt I needed to for this special show.  It was with a heavy heart that I watched the series finale 2 nights ago.  I have watched it 4 times since.  It made me cry one minute and laugh the very next.  I never wanted it to end.  What a thrill it would be to have all of the seasons on DVD.  Better yet in a packaged collection even.  I have bought 10 copies of season one to give to family and friends this week.  I will truly miss the phenomonal chemisty between Amy and Ephram, Bright and Hannah, Nina and Andy....not to mention the interaction between the characters of Harold and Andy.  You have to fall in with Tom Amandes' charming wit throughout the series.  I would have to say his portrayal of Harold made Harold one of the most beloved characters EVER.  Emily Van Camp (Amy) was such a breath of fresh air not to mention that she is breathtakingly beautiful and Gregory Smith (Ephram)...there's just something so special about him...I always thought of him as cute and truly talented.  He captivated me with his grin and especially with his smile.  Vivien Cardone (Delia) is sure to make it big one of these days as well. Her relationship with her father Andy (the extremely talented Treat Williams) was refreshing to watch.  I will truly miss John Beasley (Irv Harper) as well.  He was such a fixture and gave the show it's narrative voice from time to time.  I just loved all of these actors so much!!!  Even Debra Mooney...remember her guest spots on Roseanne?  I loved her nickname for Harold...Jr.  She also made me laugh and especially in the finale made me cry like a baby!  Well, I've ranted and raved way too much here.

I bought the Season 1 DVD's about a year ago shortly after the third season began, and I really enjoyed with finally getting to learn things I hadn't known about the characters because I started watching during the second season.

I can only thorize that CW canceled the show because it was more wholesome and family oriented than their other shows (sans 7th Heaven which survived even it's Series Finale due to amazing feed back).

Now that I am done with S1 after a couple of weeks of almost nonstop viewing, I just have a feeling of frustration when I read over various forums that it is unlikely that Warner will release the rest of the seasons because of low sales of this one.

This is hands down one of the best shows I have seen in the past ten years. Vancamp is terrific, Smith is a total discovery, the dialogues are just brilliant.....It is difficult to beat a package like this.

2078744,5,B0002DB0FO,"As the overall quality of mainstream movies declines, television seems to have become the refuge for some of the very best drama.  Everwood is a prime example of this trend.  This series has a superior cast served by excellent writing.  It does occasionally deal with ""the issues"" that we have all seen addressed in other family shows many times before. But do not let that fool you.  In very subtle ways, this show revolutionizes the genre.  For example, focusing on a single father is, after all, something that has not often been done before outside of comedies.  Also, for some reason, single dads on TV tend to have daughters exclusively. By contrast, this single dad's relationship with his son is a central theme here.  Locating the action in a small Colorado town (most of the locations are actually in Utah I believe) is also a very clever choice.  It is refreshing to see TV characters in bleak weather wearing clothes that are not meant to be stylish but warm.  And as other reviewers have pointed out, the locations are beautiful and highlighted by the show's unique photography. The storylines are captivating and the depth of characterization is really quite exceptional.  As is often the case with dramas, the dialogue is sometimes so deep that you might be tempted to think ""No-one talks like that."" Maybe.  But the feelings behind the words are real and it is impossible not to identify with them.  I am not the crying type but I have shed some tears watching Everwood.  Because I relate to it and I think most people can.  But there is humor in Everwood as well. Very clever humor at that.  This series is a gem.  Now if they could just release Season 2!

Unfortunately, sales were poor for the first season, so unless they pick up soon, the subsequent seasons will not come out on DVD. So buy Everwood for your friends/family (for birthdays, Christmas, etc.); sales HAVE to go up! This show is totally underrated.

For those of you who don't know, there is a bit of a problem with Everwood's chances of renewal. The WB will no longer exist, by September of 2006; neither will UPN. They are combining in The CW (short for CBS and Warner Bros.)! This means that they will be making some cuts; but Everwood is too good a show to let it be canceled because of a merger-type deal.

We may never know why Everwood did not sell well, at first, but we can try to fix that.

Also, Everwood returns with new episodes--through the end of the season!--on March 27! That's right, Everwood is moving back to its original Monday timeslot, right after 7th Heaven. It will return on the 27th with a two-hour events, so don't forget to tune in an hour early; you won't be disappointed. To air all 13 episodes by the end of the season, The WB is going to have to air 2 more two-hour events, not including the initial one. That might mean that we'll get to see two hours of ""fresh"" Everwood on May 22 and a two-hour finale on May 29!

(Everwood will also air in syndication, this fall, on ABCFamily; let's make sure they have more than 4 seasons to air, shall we?)

Write your letters, and don't stop with just one...or two. KEEP sending them, and don't stop until the upfronts (mid-May)! We can't let this gem of a show disappear after only 4 seasons.

2078770,5,B0002DB0FO,"I lived in the Netherlands in 2003 when the Dutch TV network started airing the series.  I left the country to return to the U.S. just as season #3 finished airing there.  I was left with the cliffhanger episode of whether or not Colin survived the second surgery. After a decade of living in Europe and enjoying the small amount of commercials compared to the insanity of the U.S. TV networks, I decided not to have any TV upon my return -- my TV is only a monitor to play videos of my choosing.  One of my only regrets about this decision is that I have never been able to see Everwood again, one of the most memorable viewing experiences I had while I still watched any kind of network TV (albeit foreign network).  When I saw that Season I of Everwood was available, I snapped it up and had watched 3 episodes the first night, having to stop myself from watching more.  My boyfriend and I started watching episodes every night, revelling in not having to endure commercial breaks, and becoming immersed in the well-formed and well-acted characters and storylines.  Alas, we finished all the DVDs within a week!  You'll laugh, cry and be thoroughly entertained with the Everwood populace on this amazingly well-written and beautifully-produced series.  The DVD set has some wonderful extras as well.  I was only left wishing there had been more than 4 episodes with a commentary track.  The amazing irony about this gem of a TV series, as explained on one of the extra featurettes, is that it is deliberately a ""small"" series, which allows it to be as rich as it is in its storytelling.  If it were more popular, it would be forced to cater more to sponsors and network mandates, and thus lose its brilliance.  Says alot about mainstream American TV, doesn't it?

I am currently signed up to be notified as soon as Series 2 is available on DVD because I've been waiting a LONG time to see if Colin survived that second surgery :-)  And while I'm at it, how about gearing up to make Series 3 available as well!",1134000000,10,2012,4.537396121883656
2078771,5,B0002DB0FO,"This show just started here in the UK on daytime television on ITV1. I managed to catch a handful of episodes whilst on holiday recently and all I can say is that, as ITV1 currently has a prime time schedule stuffed with so called ""celebrity""shows and soaps, it is shameful that this beautiful series is being squandered in day time.

Still, there are also ITV2, 3 and 4 for digital TV viewers so maybe one of those will be able to run the show in prime time which is what this show so richly deserves.

This for me is perfect dramatic television, a series with believable characters and, most importantly with real heart. Treat Williams is outstanding as troubled Dr Andrew Brown and indeed the whole cast and everything about the show is excellent, but if I had to single out one person on screen for particular praise, it would have to be the marvellous Gregory Smith whose performance as Ephram is jaw-droppingly excellent in my view.

2078783,5,B0002DB0FO,"Most evening television shows are becomingly increasingly sexual, violent, and mature. Everwood is one that almost any age can appreciate.

 Everwood, now into its fourth season, is about a famous neurosurgeon that moves from New York City to Everwood, Colorado, along with his son and daughter, after his wife dies. The series is a heart-warming story of this family and their adjustment and life in a new place. The actors are well-chosen, and bring the audience to form an attachment to them. The series does have a certain level of maturity, introducing topics such as death, illnesses, teen pregnancy, and drinking abuse. These issues are not glamorized unlike the way presented in most media today. They are dealt with as problems and situations that need to be assessed and solved. This series is mostly about developing relationships with family and friends and overcoming obstacles.

 Starting in the early evening, television is crammed full with shows about sex, deceitfulness, and drugs. Each show you watch seems to overcome you with things that although interesting, illustrate bad situations as usual events in life, such as infidelity, and betrayal. Also, with all the new reality television series, ""real"" life seems like it should be all about partying, as in MTV's Real World, or competition, as in America's Next Top Model. Most shows today do not have a whole lot of decency in them.

2078792,5,B0002DB0FO,"You've heard of 7th Heaven as a wholesome family drama. You've heard of One Tree Hill as a slightly angst teenage drama. You've heard of The O.C. as a primetime Soap Opera. And then you've vaguely heard of ""Everwood"" which has been compared to 7th Heaven, Dawson's Creek and Gilmore Girls. Although Gilmore Girls is arguably the best dramedy on television, Everwood is a brilliant Drama with a wonderful set of characters and stories.

The first season starts off with the death of Julia Brown, a surgeon's wife and mother of two. The renowned New York surgeon, Dr. Andy Brown (played marvelously by Treat Williams), who has spent most of his life working and neglecting his family, is devastated by his wife's death. He then decides to move his children, 15-year-old Ephram Brown (Gregory Smith) and 9-year-old Delia Brown (Vivien Cardone) from their beloved New York home to the small and quaint town of Everwood, Colorado. Although Ephram, in his teen-angst, is furious at his father for moving them, the viewer can't imagine how someone could hate a town so serene, yet majestic. With its breathtaking hills and wonderful landscape, you'd wonder why anyone wouldn't want to live there. But the Browns are city people, especially vaguely geeky and introvert Ephram who finds it especially hard to adjust when he meets Amy who dazzles him at first sight, and then finds out she has a boyfriend, Colin, who's in a coma.

I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ""family drama"", though. The season centers on the Browns' the adjustment to Everwood and Colin's slow recovery. Furthermore, subjects such as abortion and homosexuality are presented in unexpected and somewhat controversial ways. Those subjects continue more abundantly during the second season which is also worth getting on DVD if or when it comes out (release date has not yet been set).

What makes Everwood different from 7th Heaven, The O.C., Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill and all the other dramas on TV is (first of all) the writing on the show. The stories are unpredictable without being confusing or too far-fetched. It is smart, dramatic and still maintains light-hearted and witty moments to make you laugh and smile. The dialogue is believable without being dull and simple. It's original and realistic and delivered wonderfully by all of its actors (that's right, all of them) which brings me to the second reason Everwood is so great: the acting. It's a shame nothing about Everwood has attracted the Emmy voters, but as critics agree, Everwood features Treat Williams, Gregory Smith, Emily Van Camp and Tom Amandes just to name a few who play their roles perfectly. You can easily get attached to the characters and feel what they feel just like on television shows like Gilmore Girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and even Sex and the City. I should also mention what few reviewers do when reviewing a TV show: Everwood is visually extremely pleasant. It is filmed in Utah and parts of Canada, so the landscape is beautiful but the sets are also good eye candy for the show and set the tone of certain scenes almost magically.

Although Everwood doesn't get a particularly large number of viewers each week, it is a true masterpiece. It isn't written like a guilty pleasure; it doesn't feel like a guilty pleasure and definitely is not a guilty pleasure. It's been a long time since television has aired a pure drama as good as Everwood. It's not like most TV shows, it's better.",1125100800,4,3451,4.84406779661017

Another plus is that you don't have to send your kids out of the room to watch it.  There is no bad language, or risque scenes, but normal every day topics such as sex and teen pregnancies are handled in good taste, and bring up points to discuss with your own family after the show.

2078798,3,B0002DB0FO,"The WB has yet, again conjured up another dramatic-teen show and have basically not changed the premise of its characters or production at all. I'm not afraid to admit that I did watch this show for a while and did like it only because of its ""hook-liner"" premise: A family oriented television show concerning a man, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams undoubtedly is easier to look at when he's got hair on his face), who has lost his wife and deals with the difficulties he goes though trying to reconnect with his Son, Ephram, an overly emotional teenage boy who seeks his old home in New York after moving to Everwood and blames his father for his mother's death, and his daughter Delia who doesn't appear to have any qualms about moving except when concerning her new school. But as the show progressed it began to turn to be just like all the other teendramas on WB54; The brooding teenage boy meets the 'The girl every-guy wants, with a dark past' young blonde girl (daughter of a Doctor who becomes rivals with Ephram's father, who reminds me of ""Squidward"" of Sponge-bob square-pants) and eventually develops feelings for her later on in the show, everyone in high-school has to be ""together/couple"" when in reality its not like that all, the dramas concerning the young girl Delia is mediocore but its believable, and the teenagers, (who are, naturally about as wise as a undeveloped tomato) always ends up correcting the Parents on everything instead of the other way around.

The only real change is the more focus on the adults and their troubles. At least it was before the ""O.C"" and ""One-Tree Hill"" Reared their ugly heads. Teenagers who are into the heavy-drama type shows will enjoy ""Everwood"". It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, sadly.------- [a 3 out of 5]",1116115200,7,1779,4.7387096774193544

2078837,5,B0002DB0FO,"Thank god for The WB. It has been a while since there has been a family drama that is so refrshingly honest, sincere, engaging, and brave. Since it's debut in September of 2002, this show has emerged as the crown jewel in the network's arsenal. Filled with fresh stories and new twists on old conventions, this show also boasts an incredible cast who bring to life realistic and engaging characters. This show continues to grow and expand on this brilliance in it's two subsequent seasons. Do not let the reviews who state otherwise fool you. It stays true to itself in later seasons and I can only assume these reviewers were unhappy with what happened and toss it off as ""bad"" or ""not as good"" simply because they didn't get it. Thank god the critics and real fans do. Treat Williams stars as famed New York surgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown. A workaholic with a wife and 2 kids. When tragedy strikes the family, he makes an about face in his life and moves his kids to the idyllic town of Everwood, Colorado. There he sets up shop with a practice in the town's old train station, which is right across the street from the town's only other physician, Dr. Harold Abbott(perfectly played by the fantastic Tom Amandes). Andy's son is 16 year old Ephram(The superb Gregory Smith), a loner type kid with a major chip on his shoulder concerning his father. And then there is 9 year old Delia(Vivian Cardone), a littly dynamo with a penchant for baseball caps. Others include Dr. Abbott's daughter Amy(The adorable Emily Van Camp), Abbott's son Bright(The funny Chris Pratt), Abbott's mother, and Andrew's nurse, Edna(The great Debra Mooney), her husband and town bus driver Irv(John Beasley), who is also the show's narrator, and Andy's lovely neighbor Nina(Stephanie Niznik). It had been such a long time since I had watched a stellar debut season. It was perfect. The show manages to be as realistic as possible and tries to go as far as it can with certain topics. Something I am sure the people who said the seasons afterward were no good only because they couldn't take the show's incredibly gutsy moves. One of the show's strengths is taking overused storylines and giving them a fresh and invigorated new shot at life. The ongoing arc this season between Ephram's love for Amy and her comatose boyfriend Colin Hart regaining his self and wanting to be Ephram's friend, is one cool example. The show is intelligently and creatively written, and is one of the most beautifully shot shows on television. Treat Williams has been given one heck of a career resurgence. He is so perfect for the show and this is really his moment. Where's his Emmy nod?. Tom Amandes as Dr. Abbott is right up there. He made his character a pompous fuss bucket and then turned him into a real human being who isn't all he seems. The banter and wars between him and Andy are priceless and are about as enjoyable as you can get. Episodes here range from the great to the fantastic. Some include the brilliant ""Episode 20"", a show about abortion. What happens is an impeccably written episode that shows both sides and different angles of the subject and it's choices. Well done. Other highlights include ""A Thanksgiving Tale"", ""Is There A Doctor In The House"", ""The Kissing Bridge"", ""Colin The Second"", and the fantastic finale, ""Home"". The kids here are all very well presented. Gregory Smith is a real find. A great repreentation of a young kid who isn't perfect and has issues. Emily Van Camp as Amy is his equal. Those big pretty doe eyes are nice too!. The WB should be proud. It has a show that is for everyone, and doesn't shy away from important topics. Nor does it cookie cutter it either. It's honest, tender, funny, realistic, life affirming, and brave. You will enjoy your trip to the rocky environs of Everwood. A place that you will want to visit again season after season. Enjoy your stay.",1106265600,13,3874,4.681818181818182
2078838,5,B0002DB0FO,"Everwood is the best show on T.V right now, no wonder it puts out the best box set of the year... Of the century!!!! I can't wait until second season, I just hate the fact that WB Home Video is not like 20th Century Fox, because they always told when the next season of Buffy would be released!
 Anyway, this IS a GREAT box set, and I recommend buying it because you won't regret it. I watched every Episode, plus the ones with commentaries I watched again!!! This is the only Box Set worth having!",1105833600,3,498,4.242105263157895
2078839,5,B0002DB0FO,"My wife and I watched Everwood religiously during its first and second seasons. Season One was great. We loved the characters, the writing, the dramatic elements, the comedy, the thought-provoking narration. Unfortunately, we both feel the show began to decline in Season Two, which included more sex and drugs, and also over-did some themes (Amy and Colin issues, etc.). We were especially offended by the teen sex. Season Three now appears to be descending further into a mere teen soap opera. Disappointing.

I would highly recommend Season One, except you will probably get hooked and want to watch the following seasons, which I am unable to recommend.",1101859200,4,657,5.140186915887851
2078840,4,B0002DB0FO,"Everwood, Colorado had never seen anyone like Andrew Brown before. A world-class surgeon featured in magazines and newspapers around the world, the good doctor lands in Everwood following a tragic turn of events in his life in New York, and from that point on, the small mountain town was never the same.

In this show, now in the third season on The WB, Treat Williams stars as Dr. Andy Brown. After his wife dies in a car accident, Andy moves his children, teenager Ephram and younger Delia, to the tiny mountain town of Everwood, Colorado, mainly because he remembers his now-deceased wife mentioning the village once. As a doctor, Andy was amazing, but his parental skills were severly lacking. He had worked most of his life at his job, and the family almost came second. Now he realized it had to come first and it was a tough adjustment for both himself and his kids.

Treat Williams is fantastic in the role of Dr. Brown. You almost believe that he is a world-class surgeon, who now practices free family medicine. But the best we see him at is in his relationship with his son, which features the backbone for the show, particularly in the first season.

Ephram is played by the very talented Gregory Smith. He has the whole brooding teenager bit down perfectly. His anger toward his father is well documented throughout the season, but you also see that despite it all, he still cares about him. A talented piano player, the youngster tries to strike a balance in life with music, his father and school all major players in the balance.

Emily VanKamp stars as Amy Abbott, the beautiful daughter of the town's 'other' doctor, Harold Abbott. She quickly becomes interested in Ephram, but for reasons that really have nothing to do with him, but more to do with his father. This first season served as a spring board for the Amy-Ephram arc that continues to this day.

Debra Mooney is also great as Edna Harper, mother to Dr. Abbott and nurse to Dr. Brown. She comes across as exactly the type of person you might meet in a small mountain town. Her husband Irv, played by John Beasley, doesn't get as much screen time as he deserves, but he does serve as the narrator on the show. The narration on the final episode is probably one of the best on any television show in a long time.

Vivien Cardone plays young Delia with the perfect amount of innocence needed for the part. She is more foregiving than her older brother, but also manages to find trouble of her own in many different ways.

Chris Pratt had a smaller role in the first season than in season two. As Bright Abbott, Amy's brother, he served mainly as a protagonist to Ephram at the start, but his character made some great strides over the season and was a key part of season two.

Tom Amandes plays Harold Abbott, certainly providing much of the comic relief of the show. He is a true family man, but very set in his ways, which leads to many interesting situations. While originally not pleased with Andy's arrival, he begins to see the newcomer as an asset as the season, and subsequent ones, moves on.

This show deals with a lot of tough issues. The town certainly has its share of problems, but the arrival of Dr. Brown seems to bring some of them to the front for everyone to see. Heavy issues like drunk driving and abortion move through the town and the cast and writers do a great job of handling the situations.

This show is recommended for anyone who likes a quality drama without much violence and with a focus on family issues.",1101772800,7,3514,4.545886075949367
2078841,5,B0002DB0FO,"As a very demanding TV viewer, or at least one who tells the truth about what she likes and why..this program is a 10.  I have been enthralled since the first shouting sequence in which

Ephram tells his father, he wishes he (his dad) had died, instead of his mother. I haven't always known why I liked this series so much, but at this moment I recognize how refreshing it is to see MALES as children, adolescents and adults; depicted as vulnerable,heroic,bumbling,brilliant,generous,selfish,talented,

angry,funny,loving,and romantic; but usually well intentioned and willing to learn and change from their experiences.

I have recommended this ""season"" to a friend/surgeon for levity and learning in relation to his practice/co-workers, his wife, his children and his ever-inspiring search for who he is...For that matter, I recommend it to everyone bravely on this same path for him/herself.",1100908800,7,894,5.364285714285714
2078842,5,B0002DB0FO,"I had never seen an episode of ""Everwood"" before, but the premise intrigued me. A renowned brain surgeon moving to the middle of nowhere after his wife dies to establish new ties, build a new family, and perhaps forget past failures. Treat Williams is excellent as Dr. Andy Brown, a talented surgeon who treats his patients better than his own children. Andy is neglectful, but not intentionally. His absence from his children's lives is maybe an admission that he has not clue how to relate to them. Watching him bond reluctantly with his hostile son is one of the many pleasures of this delicate, intelligently-written show.

  Dr. Brown is an affable man, yet flawed, which makes him instantly recognizable. His struggles to properly raise his son and daughter form the core of ""Everwood"". Williams anchors the show with his vivid, tortured protrayal of a man with internal demons hidden by a calm facade. He's the type of man one would enjoy inviting to a poker game, a basketball tournament, or a beer in the local bar. His son Ephram, played by the amazing Gregory Smith, is a gifted pianist who clashes with his father over issues of desertion and emotional detachment. Watching them spar and yell and eventually come to a greater understanding of each other is an almost religious experience. Ephram challenges his father to see if he really cares. and his testing brings the family close to the verge of an emotional meltdown. He's the type of adolescent who is fiercely loyal to his friends, sees through the transparency of phony peers, and is uncompromising in his demands for basic decency. The daughter, Delia, is a sweet kid who just wants to fit in at school, but has a tough time adjusting to the almost alien climate of Everwood.

  The subplots are compelling, the supporting cast uniformly superb, and the character interactions credible. The season finale builds suspense so brilliantly it's almost painful to watch. After viewing the final episode, I regretted that I would have to part company with these special people, at least for a short time (which means that either the writers did a stellar job or I need to get out and socialize more!). ""Everwood"" makes you cherish the people you take for granted in everyday life, whether they're brain surgeons, grocery checkers, or the kid that delivers your morning newspaper.",1100822400,98,2345,4.894206549118388

Instead, I'm going to tell you how great this dvd is ! I don't live in the US so I only fell in love with the show when it aired here a year later and I knew then that I had to have it. The second season has just finished here so the only way i can escape into the magical world of everwood was to buy this dvd!

Anyway on a more pratical side- its reasonably cost-effective and arrives on accurate time. Having this season to watch whenever you want is just a luxury that get me through some tough days!! buy it now , you'll love it . cant wait for season two on dvd !! :)",1100131200,2,722,3.9452054794520546

This show is so emotional, you see these two kids who have always depended on their mother because there father was an ass and was never around. Suddenly, their mother passes away in a tragic car accident, and none of them can cope with this loss. The father ups and moves the family to a town his wife passed through years ago hoping to start a new life.

2078845,5,B0002DB0FO,Everwood is the best TV show on now and what a better way to get ready for its third season than to go back and watch the first season on DVD.  Watching the first few episodes of the first season was a great way to review how all of the storylines started.  Putting 23 episodes on 6 discs instead of 4 makes the picture quality outstanding and the sound is great too.  Even some of the commentary (4 episodes) is interesting because it is done by a different collection of cast and crew for each of the 4 episodes.  The extras which include a gag reel and a feature on the making of the show are better than the extras on most DVD sets today.  Overall it is one of the best DVD sets that I have purchased.,1095120000,4,705,4.079710144927536

2078848,5,B0002DB0FO,"This has to be one of the most enjoyable series on t.v. at the moment.  I don't know about anyone else, but I am very very tired of adding one more 'cop show' to my list of watchables.  this show is a wonderful mixture of day to day REAL LIFE, without the unnecessary violence.  While it does have some controversial topics, they are topics that do need to be dealt with and for some families, they need to be dealt with in the present.  Treat Williams' character, Dr. Brown, has a charisma that would make anyone like him, and he does.  While the rest of the cast is very enjoyable, I must say that Dr. Brown is by far my favorite.  I especially love the naration by Irv (john beasley) it adds an emotional quality and puts the storyline into perspective (and sometimes brings a tear to my eye). Debra Mooney plays Dr. Brown's nurse, (Dr. Abbott's mother) and adds a bit of spice to the show, this show could not do without her.  After every episode, I always get the feeling i want to pack up and move to a small town in Colorado.........
