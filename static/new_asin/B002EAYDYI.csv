3916401,5,B002EAYDYI,"Terrific story.  Dressler was a treasure.  Probably one of the homeliest women ever.  But, she commanded the screen and had an amazing variety of expression and terrific timing.  I wish that she would have made more movies.",1397952000,,223,4.945945945945946
3916402,5,B002EAYDYI,"Emma(released Jan/32)stars,among others,Marie Dressler,Richard Cromwell,Jean Hersholt and a very young Myrna Loy. This film ranks among Marie's all time best pictures. Frances Marion who was greatly responsible for the resurgence of Marie's career,is on board in the writing department. If anyone doesn't cry during this film,more than once,they have a heart of stone!
The story finds kindly old Emma(Marie) as the housekeeper to a successful inventor Mr. Smith and his wife. As the film opens the wife is giving birth to their fourth child,a boy. When the child comes out it is stillborn and Marie takes it and beats its' bottom until life inhabits its precious body. The mother perishes.
The family moves on, and fast forward about 20 years and Ronnie has come home(the child Emma saved and who is her favourite)to ask his father to give up college and concentrate on flying planes that he loves. While his father forbids it, Emma acts as a go between and convinces him to let Ronnie have his way. Afterwards Emma wants to know what this flying thing is all about and visits Ronnie at the airfield, only to see him do some(to her)terrifying loop-de-loops then land. After shes gives him a piece of her mind Ronnie talks her into getting into a training simulator,which Emma regrets afterwards.
Back home Emma is finally taking a month long vacation to Niagara Falls,after 20 years of waiting. Mr. Smith drives her to the train station to see her off and while there Emma gets steadily convinced that Mr. Smith and his brood will not be able to cope without her. When she refuses to go altogether she goes to ask for her money back. Mr. Smith tells her that he will come with her rather  than see her lose out on a well deserved rest. However while waiting, Mr. Smith lovingly takes her hand and proposes to her. She reticently agrees.
Out on a lake in a rowboat,after their wedding,we see Emma rowing and Mr. Smith sitting(he has a bad heart).A group of three youngsters row by in a canoe. Mr. Smith takes over the rowing duties and starts rowing at a breakneck pace. Not long into his marathon he collapses. Back at the hotel Emma is giving him his last pill of the day and exhausted he asks her to sing for him. As she starts to sing Mr. Smith silently passes away. Marie,thinking he has fallen asleep,continues on.
Back home the day before, the four children had received the news of Emma and Mr. Smith's wedding,and all but Ronnie had poo pooed it. A short few days later Emma is with the lawyer in their home getting the word that she is left as the sole heir to his estate and that she is to administer his money to the children as she sees fit. She however doesn't want the money and goes out to tell the children what she has decided. However she is met with so much derision from them all(but Ronnie) that she orders them out of the house. Immediately afterwards she has to sit not believing what she just did. Ronnie and the lawyer congratulate her. Ronnie asks if he may purchase a custom made plane and the lawyer gives his OK if Marie is agreeable....and of course she relents. Ronnie goes to the west coast to get it and is gone a while.
In the meantime the children get a hold of their own lawyer believing Emma coerced their late father into making out the will,then deliberately poisoned him. Their case gets enough legs that they are able to take Emma to court. The court proceedings do not go well for Emma and her lawyer.
Ronnie in his new plane on his way back home from a trip to Canada,sets down in Kansas City to waiting out a rainstorm. In the airdrome office he picks up a newspaper and reads about Emma's predicament. He sends a wire to his beloved Emma that he is on his way home to help. He takes off in the storm.
Back at the court,the proceedings play out  and it is the final argument stage. When Emma's lawyer starts to call her step children names she cannot take it,not ever harbouring any ill will towards them,just love. The jury comes back with a not guilty verdict. As Emma and her lawyer enjoy a quiet moment of relief a telephone call for him reveals that Ronnie has died in a plane crash. When he returns he doesn't have to say anything as Emma, just knows. As if this isn't enough,at that moment a telegram arrives;it is the one Ronnie sent to her from the airdome. She collapses into the lawyers arms.
The next day Emma has given the money back to the children. She leaves to visit Ronnie's grave and talk to him. When she returns to the house she says her good byes to the remaining three children, who all express their sincerest regrets and apologies for their despicable behaviour. They beg her to stay but she cannot,she as to move on.
Emma is soon at an employment agency and she is offered a high paying position due to her experience. But she refuses and takes a low paying position  because it has the same family dynamic as her last position. As she sits tending to the newborn,a boy of course,the mother asks her over and thanks her for saving her son's life. Asking Emma what she might really like as a thank you,she thinks a minute then asks if the new born can be named......Ronnie. The mother is quite agreeable and a proud and loving Emma holds up her new Ronnie,laughing with joy.
Director Clarence Brown could have ended this film when Marie walks out the door after saying goodbye to the children one last time. But Frances Marion wanted to grab your already broken heart strings one final time with her new job and her new Ronnie. There weren't any dry eyes in the house in 1932 and as I said,if you don't cry at least once,you have to be a rock or something,for it STILL packs an emotional wallop today. Sure it's a sentimental film, but it's never mawkish or overdone. The film strikes just the right balance and Marie Dressler should have gotten another OSCAR for this one,in fact a better performance than her winning it in Min and Bill a few months before. Marie runs the emotional  and performing gamut here. She does it all beautifully from drama,to pathos,to comedic moments and she even sings!
Technically speaking the film is full screen and there are no extras. This film has been transferred quite well as compared to,say, Politics.
All in all a joyous and wonderfully sentimental film. Marie takes the acting ball and runs with it for a touchdown and back again. Have a box of Kleenex on hand and see Marie Dressler at her finest.",1397260800,4,6409,4.522413793103448
3916403,4,B002EAYDYI,Marie Dressler gives a great performance as a maid who goes on to become the lady of the house. This is a must see for classic film lovers.,1390867200,,139,4.0
3916404,5,B002EAYDYI,"Miss Dressler stars in a wonderful tale from MGM studios.
These early films were very well produced, with often risky story lines for the time.
 Miss Dressler proves she  can act dramatically as well as do fine comedy, which she was renowned for, in quite a few of her films.
The story relates to her bringing up a family whose mother died at giving birth. when the children grow up they resent the fact that she marries their successful father, who dies shortly afterwards, leaving her his fortune.
Well worth viewing, with dramatic performances from a well groomed cast.
The film has been restored to a good standard and is still rivitting after all these years.",1367798400,,664,4.7155172413793105
3916405,5,B002EAYDYI,"I was a bit stunned & disappointed that this terrific comedy-drama was rated 2 1/2 stars. Really, folks? Were we watching the same film? This, in my opinion, is one of Marie Dressler's best performances (she was Oscar-nominated), and testimony that a woman with sagging features didn't have to be a gorgeous beauty to show 'em all how acting is done.
Marie plays title character Emma Thatcher, a crusty but devoted housekeeper to a widower & his four kids (who also fills in as ""mother"" for them). As time progresses, the father confesses his love to Emma, and they get hitched in Niagara Falls. While there, the frail husband collapses from overexertion rowing a boat, and passes away shortly after. What follows is melodrama at its finest: Now inheriting the family fortune & the home, 3 of the 4 now-adult kids shockingly turn on Emma & viciously accuse her of being an opportunist & a murderer. During her time in court, the youngest child vows to fly (during a horrendous rainstorm) to be by her side. No spoiler alerts here; you can pretty much guess what happens, which leads to the film's most heartbreaking scenes. At the very last, the kids snap out of their snobbery as Emma moves on with her life, with a glimmer of hope in the closing scene.
MGM really pulled out the stops in giving Dressler a vehicle which employs her wide range of acting talents; everything from low comedy to hearttug drama. Yet, through it all, she can keep her characterization earthy & human. If the entire film sounds heavy-handed, it's not: There are some terrific dialogue exchanges peppered throughout (both amusing & serious), and a flight simulation scene elicits some of the funniest reactions from Marie. Even the scene where she throws the three ungrateful brats out of the house is electrifying, as it seems Dressler is very close to hands-on violence! But this film says a lot about class division in a compact 70 mins. than most modern films could ever do.
It also says a lot that a woman who's been dead for many decades can still reign as one of the greatest actresses of all time.",1348876800,9,2083,4.693989071038251
3916406,1,B002EAYDYI,"Very good film. Dressler is always great. If you haven't seen it, rent it or look for it on TCM. Don't waste your money buying this DVD-R from Amazon. They list format as DVD but 'fine' print will tell you it's actually a DVD-R.

I recorded it and put on DVD-R myself (for my personal collection). Created my own cover art and DVD art. Cost about four bucks and as good as Amazon's. I've made over 1500 of these (no - I don't sell them) over the years for about four grand. Would have been about thirty grand online.

Please protest to Amazon about this misleading practice.",1321920000,3,574,4.355140186915888
3916407,3,B002EAYDYI,"Marie Dressler was the box office queen in 1932/1933. Neither beautiful nor young, watching her in ""Emma"" will easily explain her universal appeal. Playing a housekeeper who marries her employer, inherits his wealth and is taken to court by his ungrateful brood, Dressler is showcased in a part which fits her like a glove. She runs the gamut from broad slapstick humour to tragedy and never strikes a false note, encompassing the audience in her warmth and sincerity. The script is fairly predictable but the film is beautifully directed by Clarence Brown. The supporting cast are excellent including a very young and brittle Myrna Loy in an unsympathetic part, gentle Jean Hersholt as her employer and perky Richard Cromwell as her favourite. One scene in particular, when Dressler accompanies herself on the piano, is a standout.

The film has been issued expensively by Warner's Archive with no scene selection, no extras and an unrestored print. In this case, at least, the print of the film is good.",1295827200,7,1005,5.017964071856287
