1666109,3,B00005UM31,"OK, I thought the film was great. The bond between Alexis and Fernando - improbable to most ""normal"" people because of the huge age difference - makes perfect sense: Fernado is the last surviving member of his family, and Alexis' surrogate family - his gang - has been completely wiped out by rivals. They are both alone. I liked the black humour of this film. I even laughed when some people were shot. But I think I was supposed to. After all, this film depicts an absurd, ""magical"" reality. My BIG complaint is the DVD. I speak Spanish. The ""standard"" variety. This film had a lot of Colombian slang (different from that of Spain or Mexico, where I live) and I think it would've been great to have had subtitles IN SPANISH as well. That would be a great help to people studying the language too. I thought the whole point of DVDs (apart from the superior picture quality) was the possibility of adding ""bells and whistles"". Interviews with the writer (Fernando Vallejo), director and actors would've been great. My advice to fellow Amazon purchasers is avoid the DVD and get VHS. It's cheaper! :-) Better yet, see it in the cinema.",1029196800,9,1134,4.618811881188119
1666110,5,B00005UM31,"Barbet Schroeder's ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" is an impassionate, yet candid analysis of the personal and collective vicissitudes and disintegration of societal mores in the director's drug traffic-driven, native city of Medelln, Colombia.
The struggle to survive under such conditions is sensitively and honestly portrayed by the interplay of two main characters:
Fernando (German Jaramillo), an aging but virile intellectual, who happens to be a gay, and who, apathetic with his personal and professional life seeks to ""die"" (in peace?) in his native Medelln; and
Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), a teenager byproduct of family abuse, poverty, and social violence, who also happens to be a gay, and who, embroiled in the cruelty and hostility of his environment, seeks to survive day to day at gun point.
Fernando and Alexis meet under a frank, for-money pre-arranged sexual encounter, but the two unexpectedly discover in each other honesty and acceptance, compassion and empathy, from which they try to derive hope and meaning for their existences, even if only  fleeting due to the inhumane living conditions that they both must face.
THIS FILM IS AS MOVING AND SHOCKING AS PIXOTE AND EVEN MORE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY CHALLENGING!

1666111,5,B00005UM31,"Barbet Schroeder has given us a rare insight into what the future may hold should we continue on the course of senseless brutality we witness in the Media daily now.  OUR LADY OF THE ASSASSINS is a terrifyingly realistic account of the world gone mad, of the use of the gun as the immediate stimulus response solution for opposing opinions/views/misunderstandings.  The writer who is the main character seems to be time-warping into the future of what might eventually consume us.  The terror is in the reportage manner in which this film is delivered.  Beautiful young boys exist by making their bodies available to adults who have money or power or who afford food and protection.  This is not a film about male hustlers: the relationships between our main character and his young men are full of warmth and tenderness, if edged by the acerbic razor of street rules of  survival by the gun.  The visual and poetic references to the cathedrals of this Colombian town under moral siege are even more poignant in these days of the Catholic church's dealing with its own demons.  This beautifully made film is disturbing, but somehow it is not depressing because the need and fulfilment of love between two characters no matter how disparate rings loudly throughout.

1666114,4,B00005UM31,"This is, by far, Barbet Shroeder's best effort.  Perhaps his familiarity with the language, the country and its people themselves are contributing factors although Shroeder (Playboy August 2001) tells of the many problems and dangers he encountered while filming in Medellin.
I have not yet read Fernando Vallejo's novel, on which the film is based, nor have I visited Columbia so I can deal with Shroeder's work at face value only.  Still I was able to appreciate his accomplishment at a number of levels.  As an introduction to the streets and los barrios of Medellin I was fascinated.  As a documentary of the lives and sufferings of the resident populace I was moved.  As cinema I was greatly impressed with the performance of German Jaramillo who plays Fernando, a man so jaded with life that he has surpassed the fear of death yet has difficulty making his exit for any number of reasons...  One last love, a visit to a long ago cantina or church, the sound of a once familiar melody.
His youthful lover Alexis (Anderson Ballestros) by way of contrast kills rather than engaging in senseless argumentation, or to preclude personal affront but most of all to avoid being killed.  The pace of Alexis' life can only be slowed by sexuality, sleep or death.  The music which soothes him is loud and frenetic.  His sometime outward languidity cannot hide a turbulence bred of violence and danger yet he is unable to watch as Fernando mercifully kills a suffering animal.
The killing portrayed here is not for those impressed with the Hollywood blood-bath type featuring good guys vs bad guys where the good guys somehow always prevail by way of superior cunning or fire-power.  Here there is no justification.  Only futile  vengeance and self preservation.  Nobody is right.  No one wins.
Shroeder keeps the film short and uses a bare skeleton of plot to extend the running time to ninety-eight minutes.  It is only slightly more than enough and Shroeder can be forgiven for conforming to acceptable feature time length considering what he has been able to achieve.
The dialogue is superb, cutting away the veneer of myth and civilization, as humanity is reduced to an insane parody of breeding, feeding, dying and removal of bodies.  In one memorable scene Fernando rails sardonic at the determination of residents to dump corpses down a mountain side in spite of a sign clearly prohibiting the practice.  Vultures circle above awaiting the opportunity to feast on the distorted carrion.
The soundtrack ranges from pasodobles to Maria Callas and is beautifully integrated into the moods of Fernando and his youthful lovers.
Anyone interested in how much can be communicated through the art of cinema should see this film and see it more than once -- in a cinema.",1012089600,14,2763,4.90752688172043

Once he arrives he goes into a deep depression because he is the only remaining family member and he never married.

1666134,5,B00005UM31,"I don't know how many times we've watched this film.  The videotape quality is a little off-putting at first, but the story is so engaging that you forget about it.  Actually it may contribute to a more personal, intimate feeling of the film.  Yes, there is a gay couple, but it's not a ""gay"" movie.  It's really a very thoughtful anti-violence and (especially if you read the book) anti-over-population story.  When there are just too many people, things get ugly for some of them.

The young male lead is delicious.  If you're learning Spanish, this is a good film in that they speak clearly and relatively slowly (I live in Mexico now and the speed of speech is daunting).  They do use the vosotros form, though.

The filming is superb, every scene has a reason, the music is awesome, the whole package really works.  If I could give this movie 6 stars I would.

Fernando's changes are very believable - from intellectual peacenik to realist in a savage world, from gad-about boy-lover to devoted companion.

1666142,4,B00005UM31,"La Virgen de los Sicarios captures the essence of inner city life; the scenes alternate between boredom, listlessness and terror. Perhaps too numbing to be raw, the story, set in Columbia, follows Fernando Vallejo, an affluent writer, back to his hometown of Medellin and into a relationship with a sicario named Alexis. Although Fernando is jaded, it is his naivete that introduces the viewer as an outsider to the realities of the streets. This true-to-life portrayal could have been set in any given barrio in the United States. When I commend the realism, understand that I am referring to harsh realities like the daily ebb and flow of gang violence in the streets. Understand too, that Alexis is fifteen - more than old enough to be an established sicario trapped in the endless cycles of reciprocal revenge - and his relationship with Vallejo is romantic.

1666144,5,B00005UM31,"It is Christmas Eve 2008 as I write.  Last night I looked again at this film depicting life in Medellin Columbia.  The film was written before 9/11.  When viewed today after 9/11 and the subsequent wars and the outright evil today dominating usa political, governmental, business and religious life - this film is a prophetic masterpiece about life in the usa and increasingly around the world.  TO think that this is a gay movie is to totally misunderstand the movie and its intent. Yes, the film is shocking and distrurbing.  USA life today has evolved to be the same as depicted in the film!  Life has become cheap. Government has no respect for people.  Usa leaders everywhere at every level are corrupt thieves. Religious leaders have become useless.  Pedophilia is allowed to persist within the Catholic priesthood unabated. GLBT people are victims of discrimination. Drug investation is everywhere. Pro-Life christians elect war promoters/defenders.  The list goes on and on.  Somehow this the film script/sscreenply contains great wit. insight, and WISDOM. One can only hope and pray that somehow goodness will one day again reign over this world. On this Christmas Eve, every living soul should feel ashamed about the world in which we live and take some action to make this world a better place.  This movie depicts the horror of our world today and it is not pleasant having reality hit you in the face. The film shows what is with great clarity.  But it is the truth - whether you like it or not.  If you have not yet seen this film, by all means do so.  If you have seen it previously, see it again.  In either case, buckle your seatbelt.

1666147,5,B00005UM31,"I am not sure how much of this film is autobiographical and how much is fiction.  I do know that Fernando Vallejo, the novelist who wrote the novel ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" as well as this film's screenplay, is a reknowned Colombian author who, like the Fernando in this film, spent much of his life in voluntary exhile.  (In the real Fernando's case, the exhile was in Mexico and Italy).  In another series of novels Vallejo has written extensively about the difficulties of growing up gay in Colombia, so there is a possibility that in the novel and film versions of ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" we are getting glympses of his own life experience coming back to Medellin as a middle-aged man.

Both the film and the novel present a touching but in many ways distasteful romance between an affluent older man and an underaged hustler/hired killer from the Medellin underclass.  Neither the film nor the novel pass judgment on the relationship, but both make the viewer/reader squirm.  There is the obvious question of poor youth being exploited by an older man.  Additionally, the older man is an unapologetic snob, a hedonistic social-darwinist whose contempt for the indigent around him reflects very poorly on the Colombian bourgeoisie.  The younger man, beneath the angel face, is nihilistic and an apparently uncritical respository of crass international pop culture.  The duo's comments about their lives and their meanderings through Medellin depict a very sick society--a portrait that is the thrust of Vallejo's novel.

Other commentors on this webpage suggest that they do not find the wanton violence in this film credible.  Unfortunately, the press reports on life in Bogota and Medellin (particularly the latter, as one of the capitals of the cocaine cartels) bear out Vallejo's portrait.  So, too, do the stories of many affluent Colombians who have emigrated to Miami in order to escape violence.  And sadly, the literature and films about slum children from other large Latin American cities--Pixote (Sao Paulo), Los Olvidados (Mexico City), Amores Perros (Mexico City)--touch on similar themes  [See the recent Colombian novel ""Satan"", by Moreno, which is a portrait of Bogota gone to hell].  This is an unpleasant, painful portrait--and we are seeing the portrait through the eyes of people who are alternatively sympathetic and horrible.  But the portrait is probably realistic, as are our guides.

The deliberate use of unsophisticated cameras in this film add to the feeling of cinema verite and enhance the film's impact.  All in all, this is an impressive undertaking, and the film goes beyond the novel in engendering dispair over the well-being of Colombia.",1159747200,4,2685,5.1192660550458715
1666148,1,B00005UM31,"Wow, this was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  And this is coming from someone who loves small foreign flicks, whose favorite movie is the similarly-themed City of God.  Our Lady of the Assassins may not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly the most incompetent.  I can't stress enough how bad this movie is.  I kept watching out of sheer wonder that anything could be this terrible.  This film fails on so many levels that it is hard to list, but I'll give it a try:

First, the acting is gawd-awful.  The actors are all unprofessionals, and it shows.  They stiffly recite unconvincing dialogue; at every moment, we are aware that they are acting.  Not once in the entire movie does it lose the feeling of a middle-school drama class.  There is absolutely no romantic chemistry between the leads either; its almost painful to watch.

Oh, what next?  How about the plot?  Oh wait, there is no plot.  The protagonists wander aimlessly throughout the city spouting nihilistic dialogue that would have felt stale in Waiting for Godot, all the while shooting random people.  That's it.  The screenwriter mixes this bland existentialism with some of the most cheesy love lines ever set on film.  Here's a sample: ""What do you wish for?"" ""That we could be together forever!""

While the movie pounds its pretentious despair into your head, the incompetent direction undercuts this theme at every turn.  The killing scenes are so poorly acted and choreographed that they become hilarious.  The camera work is a dead ringer for a cheesy low-budget soap opera.  Apparently the director is an industry veteran, which makes me feel like he must have this movie purposefully awful; but a bad movie is still a bad movie.  Here's a tip:  If you want us to buy into your grandiose existential themes on society, don't shoot yourself in the foot by filming a hilariously bad script with wooden actors and high school musical production values.",1148428800,5,1962,4.773809523809524

I can accept a story of a gay lifestyle.  It is common enough.  But there was no effort to give the characters depth beyond identifying the adult as wealthy and the boys as poor and desperate to please.  The senseless killing that highlighted these young men's behavior brought no meaning to the story, expect to realize that death leads to death.  And life goes on.  I do not think that what was told in this film was any different than what might be told in New York, Paris or London.

1666152,1,B00005UM31,"I have read several reviews on this film and had seen that it had won numerous awards, but this was one of the worst films of 2000. I am not sure what director Barbet Schroeder or screenwriter Fernando Vallejo were trying to accomplish with this film, but it just didn't happen. I understand that perhaps this was a piece of Fernando Vallejo (the screenwriters) life (see connection of names of Fernando Vallejo and Fernando in the film), but it didn't make any sense. Coupled with the fact that this film was in another language, the overall themes were not brought at well at all.

Let's begin with the title. La Virgen de los Sicarios or Our Lady of the Assassins. This is what initially threw me off. I was expecting perhaps a story about assassins (see the title), but that was not the case at all with this film. Alexis (the boy) does nothing more but shoot random people, then director Barbet attempts to make a very big leap with the connection that perhaps Alexis (the boy) is doing nothing more but killing the evil people in the world. He is perhaps doing the work of God himself (or herself). That is a huge assumption, since we have nothing to base this on other than the fact that he kills some random gang members and almost a waitress that did nothing wrong but give them bad service. There is a religious theme in this film, but it is so faint that I had trouble seeing it. There are moments when the two travel to the churches only to find some inhabited by prostitutes and drug addicts. Oh, can't everyone see the heavy and deep symbolism happening here?? Please, I have seen better moments watching crackers in soup.

 Next, there was the acting in the film, which nobody could do. I don't know if this was everyone's first film or what, but it seemed as if they were all reading their lines from cue cards and overdoing it. Perhaps it was the fact that it was in another language made the acting tough. When English is used, you can sometimes forget the actors and hear the words, this was not the case in this film. The use of Spanish only hurt the actors even more. I believed none of the characters. I couldn't get into them at all, and I blame the actors for that. Fernando (the man) and Alexis (the boy) were the worst. They were supposed to be in love, but that emotion was lost in the first little bit of this film. I never once believed that they were lovers, and that was an important part of the film!! Who wrote this film? I would like to read the three words they must have learned in Screenwriting School. I would also like to attend, because it seems as if you can graduate without learning anything. The line that sticks in my mind the most is when Alexis (the boy) is shot down Fernando (the man) takes him to the hospital trying to save him, but sadly Alexis (the boy) dies. The doctor comes out and simply says, ""Why did you bring a corpse here?"" WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU TAKE IT??? Come on people.

Finally, perhaps the hardest part to get over, was the fact that this film was filmed in HD Video format. It just felt like there was an amateur behind the camera instead of a respected director. It also made the film seem more like a movie instead of a story. I was continually reminded that I was watching a movie and not really at that location ... that should never happen. Overall, this was a horrible movie that only proves that critics either love the big budget films, or that little films that apparently need no talent to make at all. I can hear them now, ""oh, it foreign and about gay people ... we have to love this one"". It is truly a sad day when a film like La Virgen de los Sicarios wins any awards.

Well, I am off to shed my tears now and watch something ... anything ... that is better!!

1666156,2,B00005UM31,"I'm not one to shy away from violent films, but Mr. Schroeder succeeded in making me cringe with the cornucopia of violence in ""Our Lady...""  Colombia is a pretty violent country, but the heartlessness that goes on in this film is beyond disturbing.  Mr. Schroeder tries to suggest that in a world where life has very little value, violence is considered as normal as shaking someone's hand.  Colombia is not that vicious--the people there are very respectful, and they do care about each other.  This film makes no such suggestion--only that every other person in Colombia has the propensity to kill another human being in the blink of an eye.  German Jaramillo does a fine job playing the role of a gay writer who falls in love with a young boy, a ruthless assassin who kills members of a rival street gang at random.  It's a shame that Mr. Jaramillo's talent is squandered in this filth.  This film reeks of decadence.  The main shooting gallery, where all the junkies get high, is located inside a church.

1666157,4,B00005UM31,"""Our Lady of the Assasins"" isn't based on a true story, but in a book written by a Colombian, Fernando Vallejo, who happened to give his name to the main character of his book. This film doesn't necessarily show Colombia's reality, but is strongly inspired by it, as seen by both Fernando Vallejo and Barbet Schroeder (the director of this film).

Having said that, I would like to outline the plot of this film. Fernando Vallejo (German Jaramillo), the main character, is an important Colombian writer who has returned to his native country to die, even though he isn't sick. Too strange?. Not really, the explanation is simple. Fernando has travelled the world for too many years, and wants to live the rest of his life in Colombia.

As a result, he settles in Medelln, a city that he almost doesn't recognize due to the fact that it has changed enormously during his absence. Violence is common, and drug lords give employment to the youth. Killings, even for seemingly small reasons, are at the order of the day. The logic of survival is clear for the insiders: kill or be killed. Fernando Vallejo, however, has lost his condition as an insider due to his prolonged absence. He will face a dramatic learning process, regarding life in Medelln and the ""ethics"" of death in that city.

Fernando will also establish a homosexual relationship with a young man he meets at a party, Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros). Alexis is a ""sicario"", an assassin for hire condemned to death by a rival gang, who doesn't hesitate to kill as many people as he deems necessary, merely out of instinct. Despite that, he shows a strange kind of faith in the saints, specially in the ""Lady of the Assassins"".

Is this a good film?. Yes, I think so, even though it isn't a ""feel good"" movie. I should point out that I love ""feel good"" movies, but I think that everybody should know what he is going to see. ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" is sometimes shocking, uses crude language, has quite a few sexual scenes and is highly likely to be offensive to many people. What is more, violence pervades the whole movie so deeply that by the end the spectator even gets accustomed to it. Notwithstanding all that, the movie itself and Vallejo's conversations with his lover on life, religion and other matters will make you think and reflect on a situation that might be totally alien to you, that is what happens when violence reigns supreme. And of course, that is never a bad thing, even if you don't agree with the opinions presented in this film.

The movie is filmed in an almost soap opraish lighting scheme but neither this nor the english subtitles detracted from the film in any way. This movie will make you laugh in places you do not think you should. Itis also very moving at times. Itis a movie about imparting wisdom from the old school to the new generation of the brave new frightening world.the relationship between the older man and the young man seems as natural as breathing itself. they seem to have been able to find true commitment to each other in a world of hatred and constant squabble. There is a twist near the end of the film that will leave you wondering how it can continue but even this possibly greavous obstacle is conquered by the power of love and faith. You will not be dissapointed in this movie.

1666159,5,B00005UM31,"In one word: GREAT. I loved the movie for it is reality look on life. I have many Colombian friends who suggested me to watch this movie. I've never been, sadly enough, been to Colombian (I hope to plan that somewhere in the future). But this movie really gave me the feeling that I got a good look inside the life of Colombians. And although it is hard, raw and (therefore?) more real then some might can handle, I thought there was also a gentle touch in their. A romantic kind. That that romance must be between two boys with a big age difference must not bother anyone. It happens, the age differences and the gay stuff. I know it is illegal in some countries to have that kind of an age difference or even a relationship between two men, or women. But the movie is not about what is right or wrong, good or bad, normal or not normal, legal or illegal... it is about life and how it is been experienced. And moreover, how the reality is of love (which isn't always between the guidelines of law and morality).",1102118400,2,1013,4.30890052356021
1666160,5,B00005UM31,"Every now and then a movie comes out that most certainly prompts a visceral response from viewers  ....some are astounded and awed, while others are disgusted and angry to have sat through the film.... well, this is one of them and it should have come with a warning label. First, if a homsexual love affair of two men grosses you out, then DO NOT buy this film, second, if real life exploration of what can only be described as an urban war zone of a society in extreme trouble, again this isn't the DVD for you ....

On the other hand, if you are a Colombian or have Colombian friends and perhaps maybe have visited Medellin, then this is one fabulous picture. The homosexual aspect of this movie is actually quite tangential in that it allows the director a vehicle to tell his story of life on the streets of Medellin for the teenage assassins running amok within the city and society ...

The movie starts with a 50'ish author, Fernando, after some years abscence, returning to Medellin  so that he can die in his natal city. Fernando is a highly educated man, with an intimate and complete knowledge of the history of the city and with a taste for young teenaged boys. The actual sex scenes in the film are few and relatively discretely filmed. (...for the squeamish you can just close your eyes for a few seconds or so...) These relationships are not gratuitous sex and are important to the story since Fernando must form a very deep bond with the young assissins to be able to move freely among them. Along the same lines, the fact that moral values are pracically non existent among these young killers will not escape the viewer.

The absolute wonder of this fabulous film is the real life, and I mean, real life, portayal of the lives of these young killers walking among the population of the city. Naturally a policeman is nowhere to be found since these people live by another set of rules and are all pretty well desensitized to violent deaths of their friends, families and themselves.... If you know the city of Medllin at all you will swear that you are walking the streets with Fernando and Alexis, his young lover...

The DVD is pretty simple with very little extras, it is of course in Spanish with English subtitles. For Spanish speaking people you will immediately realize that the subtitles do not give breadth and depth to the actual dialogue but the translation is about as good as it can get when dealing with a rich language like Spanish .... The movie does have digital Dolby 5.1 and the video is clear cut and crisp since it was filmed by a video camera and not a movie camera which has a tendency to soften the images of the final movie. This crispness does not take away from the movie but rather enhances the breathtaking real life aspect ....

Certainly this movie will leave an impression on the viewer and you will have no problem remembering the movie, the actors and also the city of Medellin and Colombia. The director does not in any way have a hidden agenda (rare in today's world of Micheal Moores crockumentaries) and he sticks to the main theme of the film exploring the life and times of these little killers among us.

On a final note the VHS versions sell super cheap and are probably a much better deal for this film on Amazon than the DVD version  ....",1101081600,8,3301,4.525167785234899

Actually, I'm not even sure if I can classify it as such, because I couldn't actually force myself to watch the whole thing.  First of all, the movie looks like it was homemade.  The film quality is like that of a soap opera, which, to tell the truth was almost more than I could handle in the first place (and very, very rarely is film quality something that I even think about when I watch a movie).  Secondly, as other reviewers have mentioned, the plot and the script are pathetic.  I really cannot express how horrible this movie was.  Also, on a personal note, I was really bothered by the fact that the main character who appeared to be in his fifties or sixties has two ""deep"" romantic relationships with two boys who must be in their teens.  I know that this might not bother anyone else, but personally it really grosses me out (because of the age difference (it's be illegal in the US)not because they're gay).

1666163,4,B00005UM31,"This is an extremely powerful movie, but it's not really a 'gay' love story despite the assertions of the other reviewers, who misunderstand completely the real nature of the relationship between Fernando, the central character, and his beautiful teen-aged lover, Alexis.

No, this is a powerful movie about despair.  After all, if you deny any salvation, you must repeat the hopelessness of everything, make hopelessness inevitable.

The central character, Fernando relentlessly embodies a spirit of negativity towards absolutely everything - even his young male lovers are assassins. The youth and innocence of Alexis is merely the foil against which Fernando's obsessive depression plays itself out.

Step by step Fernando exposes his young lover Alexis to the death to which that boy is destined.  It is a strange ""being hatefully in love,"" Alexis'lines has it.  Fernando becomes this ill-starred boys' codependent as, time and again, he does nothing to avert the youngster's fate, and everything to practically provoke the inevitable. Fernando, in his own rejection of hope, is as much a death-bringer as his young assassins, whatever his protestations.

Considering the director's last name (Schroder) it's no surprise that we find a literary allusion from the director's own ethnic background. In Goethe's Faust the Satanic emissary, Mephistopheles, is memorialized as "" ""Der Geist der ewig verneint,"" the Spirit which forever denies, and that's certainly Fernando.

The proof of my guess at a literary background for the film is Fernando's reminiscence that in childhood he had a family parrot named Fausto. There it is, Goethe's great work, and the key to Fernando's unwittingly Mephistophelian character.

Fernando's despair is less than his own ""negation"" of all trust, all hope. He's in despair of himself, and, in that, I suppose, serves as a metaphor for the nation of Columbia, with it's corruption and violence.

Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian novelist, recently pointed out that in the Latin American character there is a profound distrust of all social institutions, that spirit of negation which undermines their social progress, even as people struggle to make their government work. On one hand there's passionate self-sacrifice, as even like young Alexis who throws himself in front of Fernando to save him from the gang's bullets. On the other, a profound mistrust of everything that might work, as embodied in the character of Fernando. No accident, that the film is replete with themes of faith and utter doubt, salvation and slaughter in one character.

Fernando's despair is obvious, but what's truer and beneath the surface is his fatal negation of anything that might relieve his despair. Inevitably he loses one boy whom he makes no effort to save, and, when he's offered a second chance, tries to save another when it's too late. So much of Latin America has something of this at work in it - those themes of love and death get handled with quite some consistency in those somber films.

The predecessor of this film, by the way, is ""Rodrigo D"", a cinema verite treatment of the youngsters' gang battles in Colombia in the eighties. By the time the film was ready for release, seven of its twenty ""street boy"" actors were dead through that senseless, inevitable violence.",1076716800,11,3298,5.190207156308851
1666164,4,B00005UM31,"i have read so many reviews of this movie saying ""it's too fake, the violence is unconvincing.""
i am a colombian who has experienced gang violence and crime.  what people do not understand is that colombia is not compton, where the police come and record a crime.  here are some facts
less than 3% of crimes in colombia are successfully prosecuted, a rate lower than that of the old west, a time and place taht was supposedly lawless
the murder rate in medellin (the city where the movie is set, where my family lives), including rich neighborhoods and slums is 465 per 100,000, compton, california (the birthplace of gang violence in the US and home of gangsta rap) was only 80.2 per 100,000 in 1987 (when things were supposedly much worse)
as far as the filmmaking itself, i cannot say it si a well made movie, my interest is solely in teh subject matter
the homosexuality adds a confusing dimension to the film that is not necessary when portraying violent crime in the most dangerous place in the western hemisphere
RENT, DO NOT BUY
and yes, the violence is real, contrary to what you may think living in the suburbs, medellin is the most murderous city in the world, 6 times as murderous as compton, california",1076457600,5,1215,4.62037037037037

1666171,5,B00005UM31,"This is a love story between a lanky youth and 50-something writer whose hometown has gone to seed.  Medellin for all practical purposes is a war zone, packed with moped assassins, battling gangs, graffiti, and decadence.  Their bond proceeds from a hustler-john relationship to a love affair.  Fernando provides the apartment and mullah; Alexis, all the charms of youth. Music is used to illustrate the generation gap:  Fernando favors the mellifluous arias of Maria Callas, and Alexis prefers the kind of grinding punk that sounds like someone dropped screws into a blender & hit ""puree.""
The camera doesn't shy away from their bedroom.  The two sleep together, and in one potently sensual scene, Alexis takes a swig of tequilla and drools it into the man's mouth.  Strolling through the city, Fernando reminisces about how it once was:  his old house, the church, the bodegas, the cantinas.  He walks down memory lane in the presence of a younger man as James Whale did in ""Gods and Monsters"" (1998) with Clayton Boone.
But the anarchy of Medellin (Colombia) begins to target Alexis.  In this world, the grudges multiply exponentially as someone keeps avenging the death of a friend, relative, or fellow gang member.  Corpses pile on a hill; the violence of the gangs & drug cartels is eating the city alive.
Our Lady conflates the violence and sexuality of Alexis' life into one gorgeous image:  fireworks popping overhead, which could be a perfect backdrop for a romantic night at Fernando's, if Alexis didn't know it's also a celebration that a shipment of cocaine got through to America.  Throughout the film, the boy is stalked by his fate.
Before death intrudes and Fernando cradles the cold limp Alexis like a Pieta, nostalgic memories, witty banter, black humor, & unabashed sexuality made their bond very compelling to watch.
Too bad we feel more threatened by sex than by aggression.  Alexis at heart is a lover not a fighter.  The early moment in which he undresses before Fernando in the ""Butterfly Room,"" scrawny and vulnerable but swarthy and beautiful, we know this.  But undressing makes his gun fall with a hard clack to the floor.  He is the boy of doom.  They must make the most of their time.",1049673600,11,2215,4.879679144385027
