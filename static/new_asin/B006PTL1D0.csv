8502880,5,B006PTL1D0,As with the other set of Mickey McGuire.  This one is just as funny.  Mickey Rooney the consummate actor even as a child.  He comes across as so real.  This one is another good bet for a good time.,1400112000,,197,3.9743589743589745
8502881,5,B006PTL1D0,"Mickey Rooney is one of the GREATS! Since he drew his first breath he has entertained generations! I never tire of watching or listening (his animated character voices, he IS Santa)to him!

I hope Amazon does everything it can to make the entire Mickey McGuire series available on streaming so that more people get to see the early work of this talented man!",1384041600,,358,4.682539682539683
8502882,5,B006PTL1D0,"I have been a fan of Mr. Rooney's for as long as I can remember. He is an unbelievable actor-he can sing, dance, play any instrument available, has non stop energy, can do Drama or Comedy-This man was born in 1920-he worked in Vaudeville, on Broadway and 70 years in Motion Pictures- Silents and Talkies.  This little collection is from 1927(he's 7 yrs old)and it is impossible not to see the Genius, the Magic, when the camera is on him.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Rooney in the early 1980's.  He was gracious and kind.  I imagine he still is at 93 years old.",1367452800,2,568,4.330188679245283
8502883,5,B006PTL1D0,Mickey's Touchdown was a favorite movie short when I was a boy. The silent movie included here from 1927 is an obvious predecessor to it. The 2 other shorts I had not seen before but were equally amusing. Not sure why these and others like them did not make to TV along with the Our Gang series with which they were quite competitive at the time.,1356652800,,346,4.257575757575758
