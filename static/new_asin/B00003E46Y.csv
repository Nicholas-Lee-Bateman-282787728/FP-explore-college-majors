7918836,1,B00003E46Y,"The tape that I recieved was delivered damaged. However, I mananaged to view it once before it refused to play. I inspected the case and saw that it was cracked along with a piece of it falling to the floor. As far as the workout...the most difficult to follow of the 5 Method Pilates videos that I own.",1418169600,,303,4.241379310344827
7918837,4,B00003E46Y,"I am a Lisa Wheeler fan, and I had the video version of this DVD.  This routine is not her best one (see Dance to Fitness, part 2, which is fantastic); however, it's entertaining and is a good change of pace when you want a cardio routine that is at an intermediate level.  The moves can be tricky at first, but over time it's good that the routine isn't slowed down by instruction.",1356652800,,382,4.219178082191781
7918838,5,B00003E46Y,"I had owned the VHS of Dynamic Cardio previously but lost it inside a piece of lost luggage (I enjoy this workout so much I take it with me when I travel!). I have many other workout videos, but this one gives me the dance part of a workout that I was missing with all of the others. I wouldn't recommend this tape for beginners because the step combinations get complex rather quickly and it might not elevate your heart rate if your focus is on getting the moves right. I love the way this video combines some ballet, modern and jazz, so that I can put my own interpretation into it. I highly recommend this for someone who is looking for a workout that includes dance and is different from Kathy, Denise and Tammy Lee (whose tapes I have many and also enjoy!).",1223251200,3,763,4.305555555555555
7918839,5,B00003E46Y,"I'd seen Lisa Wheeler on some of Petra Kolber's workout tapes and that's why I ordered this one. It didn't disappoint. I would go ahead and get the VHS; you will get the good out of it.

I enjoy learning different routines and new steps, and this video provided a lot of opportunities for that. I had to ""fake"" the routines for the first few times; it was only after that that my body seemed to remember the basics so I could work on adding the embellishments. This is delayed gratification in a good way!

It was great to have three different workouts of varying intensities and with different routines. I've tried all three, but most commonly do the first and second intensities together, mostly because of time constraints.

Lisa gives great cues and good advice about how to ""feel"" the movements associated with each step. The dancers who work with Lisa (two men and two women) are well worth watching, too. Each of them has his or her own style and I am finding myself trying out a little bit of this and that. The music was fine for me, not obtrusive but rhythmic enough to help me keep time.

Yes, as other reviewers have reported, this is cardio, not Pilates. I had read the description of the tape and realized that, so I was not disappointed.

In short, it's a fun aerobic dance tape and good for the long haul.",1141257600,,1321,4.4421487603305785
7918840,4,B00003E46Y,"I have tried three of the method videos (dance to fitness, all in one workout and dynamic cardio)and this one is the best.
1. it is easy to follow. Lisa explained everything clearly and always told you what was coming. I followed her without any problem 99% of the time the first time I tried the tape.
2. it is a nice aerobic workout. The dance moves of the first section are of low impact. The second part is very similar to Lisa's section of ""dance to fitness"". The final section is more like regular hi-lo aerobics (like the Tamilee Webb tapes)than dance. I did all three and I got a good sweat.
3. the only drawback I can find is the music",1039824000,3,644,4.2439024390243905
7918841,5,B00003E46Y,"I took a lot of dance as a teenager but find it hard to find classes that cater to the middle age person. This tape does the job well. It is engaging and fun. I have had no problem doing it in my living room and making it as ""cardio"" as I need it to be. I too wonder how they can use the word Pilates since it is not referred to in the tape at all. The teacher is excellent.",998870400,2,374,3.6296296296296298
7918842,4,B00003E46Y,"I would have to agree with other reviews regarding the use of PILATES in the title.  When considering pilates is traditionally matwork,abdominal centering and lengthening, this video does not hit the mark. BUT in its' defense, the package states it is a CARDIO workout.
The dance sequences are tough to master, but that's a good thing.  This tape uses your mind and body's coordination.  You will not get bored.
As far as beginner versus advanced, the workout does raise your heartrate.  For people with more advanced conditioning, this tape will probably meet your 60% of your target heart rate.  You won't be pushing hard like with other tapes.  A beginner probably will be more around the 80% range.
Conclusion:  Buy it to supplement your tape collection.  It's fun and different.",998006400,4,783,4.969230769230769
7918843,4,B00003E46Y,"The video is broken up into short segments.  You need to do all of the segments in order to work out long enough to burn fat.  If you are a real beginner, you could do the first segment three times for a long enough work out, but that could get boring.
This is a good basic cardio workout.",988243200,2,289,3.9655172413793105
7918844,2,B00003E46Y,"This video, though promising to build up your cardio system, is too easy for even beginners.  I would, however, recommend it for elder people who are looking to just move around in a safe way.  The difference between each  level is very minimal, too.  If you want to boost your cardio system, don't  buy this!",956448000,7,309,4.545454545454546
7918845,3,B00003E46Y,"This video is fun to do.  However, it takes a coupple of watchings to really get it down and get a good work out.
The cueing is a bit spotty, and right as you think you have the combination, they change it.
However,  it is a lot of fun, especially if you like to dance and have a big living  room.  It is nice that the background people are men and women.
There are  3 sections so you can use them in different orders or combine them with  other workouts.",954288000,4,455,4.0
