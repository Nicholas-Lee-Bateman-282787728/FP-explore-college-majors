8061016,5,B0009I2L2S,"For those who appreciate early animation, this collection includes 6 b&w cartoons, one of them from a 21 year-old Walt Disney, 6 years before he would create Mickey Mouse with Ub Iwerks, in his ""Steamboat Willie"" debut. Not all of them are winners, but one of them certainly is, John Hubley's ""Moonbird,"" which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject in 1960. Most of the episodes are in fairly good condition, considering their age. Total running time is 63 minutes. Episode list:

1: ""Let's Sing with Popeye,"" b&w, 1934. Directed by Dave Fleischer for the Fleischer Studios. A very short piece with ""I'm Popeye the Sailor Man"" done ""follow the bouncing ball"" style. 4*

2: ""I Never Changes My Altitude"" (not ""Attitude"" as listed on DVD box), shown in the original b&w (there are some colorized copies of this episode), 1937. Directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Willard Bowsky and Orestes Calpini for the Fleischer Studios. Olive Oyl goes ""plane crazy about aviation,"" and heads to the sky with Bluto, with disastrous results. Popeye to the rescue! 4*

3: ""Frozen Frolics,"" b&w, 1930. Directed by John Foster and Harry Bailey for the Van Beuren Studios, with sound synchronization by Gene Rodemich. Waffles and Don trek to the North Pole, and meet many dancing animals, including penguins! (a long way from their South Pole habitat). 4*

5: ""Four Musicians of Bremen,"" b&w, 1922. Very early Walt Disney, animated by Disney and Rudolph Ising, loosely based on the Brother Grimm's fairy tale. Film quality flickers a little, but in excellent condition considering its age. 5* for historical value, and it is quite an amusing cartoon.
