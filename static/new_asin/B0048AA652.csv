8418598,5,B0048AA652,"When I heard about Eileen Juric, from the Rhee Gold Teacher Conference, I had to order her DVD's. After 40 yrs of dancing and 25 yrs of teaching, I was pleasantly surprised at the unique stretches, body awareness and the way Eileen presented the material for each age level. After purchasing and watching all 3 DVD's I knew I had to meet Eileen Juric! I asked her to come to my studio and when she said yes, I had no idea what a huge impact she would make on my teachers and students both in dance and in their lives. I have never met a more enthusiastic and passionate teacher. Eileen taught 3 classes and a teachers class. NONE of my students wanted to leave after their class had ended. Both the teachers and the students learned so much about their bodies and felt muscles we had never felt before. It was AMAZING!!! I highly recommend all 3 of the DVD's even if you don't teach those age groups. The material in the DVD's can be used for older and advanced students as well. Eileen Juric is beyond PHENOMENAL in the DVD's and in person. I highly recommend her DVD's for any serious teachers that want to help their students. You will be amazed at the results!!!",1443312000,,1166,4.377880184331797

8418600,1,B0048AA652,"As a professional ballerina, I have to be very honest, the instruction here is horrifyingly bad.

On a recreational level, it is still quite bad, there is little encouragement to improve and fundamental placement and concepts are more of break away from ballet (but not in a good way, as if it they were intentionally being portrayed wrong).

I don't think there any serious health or injury risks to this video, but in terms of any meaningful content or education with respect to ballet I would say that it is as close to none as one could get.

My greatest concern is that the underlying message being taught in this content is to be lazy and incorrect to just have fun, and think that is how ballet should be (proudly) performed in front of others, and it would seriously embarrass any such dancer who believed that.",1425340800,2,819,4.595890410958904
8418601,4,B0048AA652,Love the ideas she presents but the production quality is terrible.  She should be mic'd so you can hear clearly over the music.,1356652800,,128,4.565217391304348
8418602,5,B0048AA652,"Attention all Pre-Ballet instructors: Have you ever felt a lack of direction while teaching very young students? Are you new teaching to these age groups? Have you been teaching young students for years and are looking for something fresh? Most important -- are you currently seeing improvement in your students? And parents of little ones -- do you know how to tell the difference between great instruction and class structure and ""babysitting""?
If you fall into ANY of these categories, this series of DVDs is a must! I have had the honor and benefit of having Miss Eileen as an instructor at my studio. Without fail her methods achieve results: the students improve, they stay engaged and they have a great time. I truly wish I had these DVDs when I was a young teacher just starting out teaching the little ones -- not only is the curriculum outstanding and time-tested, but Miss Eileen articulates issues that all instructors face from time to time.

Sometimes a curriculum's success depends entirely on a particular instructor but not ""The Children's Hour of Power"". Unquestionably Miss Eileen is a Master Teacher -- but HER SYSTEM (based on Dorothy Lister's tried and true system) is what works.

I strongly encourage anyone who is teaching young children and studio owners to purchase these DVDs.

With My Gratitude Eileen!

8418603,5,B0048AA652,"I love that this video series is not just limited to ballet instructors because it's all about movement across the board: Weight shifting, weight sharing, and opposition.  Philosophies I can implement into both my jazz & hip hop classes.  Absolute brilliance in the way Ms. Eileen explains everything for all ages to understand!  It's all progressional so you can either sit down and watch the video in its entirety, or skip to a chapter that you may want to focus on specifically in your classroom.  It's all very user friendly.  Also, loved the fact that I could take her notes first and then once I had everything down for my own personal use, I was able to just take class with Ms. Eileen & her students.  It makes it easier to just glance over at my notes to make references instead of having to multi-task (There wasn't any play, pause, rewind situations), as most instructional videos do.  If you are looking to offer your students a new approach on a 'traditional ballet class', you cannot go wrong with purchasing this series!  It definitely brings the interest and enjoyment back to ballet class for all ages!  =)",1311120000,,1123,4.688775510204081
8418604,5,B0048AA652,"I can't tell you how excited I am to have this dvd series! Kudos to Miss Eileen for taking Dorothy Lister's preballet program and getting it out to the masses!

It's quite a challenge trying to motivate children in ballet class, and Ms. Juric not only makes it fun but easy to understand.

What a perfect time to launch this grassroots movement.  Coupled with the many ballet-inspired films and such hit TV shows as ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and ""Dancing with the Stars,"" it is sure to re-energize today's generation and help kick start the renewal of ballet!

8418605,5,B0048AA652,"I highly recommend The Children's Hour of Power Series to any ballet instructor. Miss Eileen keeps her students engaged and interested throughout the whole class using imagery and funny, creative phrases to describe each ballet step. It is obvious that her students are very much enjoying themselves while learning proper ballet technique in a structured environment. I think it is very important for children to develop a respect and love for ballet at a young age and Miss Eileen inspires just that. These DVDs provide ideas and tools that are adaptable for any ballet teacher to use in their classes. Even the youngest of Miss Eileen's students show an understanding of proper classical ballet technique. Every student would greatly benefit from Miss Eileen's methods!

8418606,5,B0048AA652,"This is a fantastic DVD for ballet teachers who, like me, need to make the most of limited time with their students.  Eileen Juric has broken down the ballet class and pulled out the most important concepts in ballet technique to build this method.  Her funny sayings and descriptions of the steps help students learn exactly how to execute the movements CORRECTLY while creating a fun, light environment.  This 2hr DVD is FULL of information and helpful hints about ballet technique that will benefit any dance teacher. I have been using many of Eileen Juric's exercises in my classes and I have seen a difference in just a few weeks!  My students' turn out and posture has improved. Most of all, their interest has increased.  This method makes it more accessible to them.  And when students are invested, you've won half the battle!  I highly recommend this DVD series!",1296518400,2,872,4.8120805369127515
