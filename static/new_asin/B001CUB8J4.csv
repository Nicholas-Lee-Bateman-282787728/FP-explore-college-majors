8289960,5,B001CUB8J4,Excellent telling of the notorious shootout.  Combination of actual footage and some reenactment is edited flawlessly.  Much more intense than typical Hollywood fare.  Interviews with actual officers and dispatchers make it more compelling.,1492992000,,240,6.212121212121212
8289961,5,B001CUB8J4,"Truly puts you in understanding just how officers are outgunned , as laws have changed since this occurred in the 90's , now as an officer I can speak on behalf that our access to weapons has changed to allow us to handle the threat much more in a responsive manner and extinguish the situation , good video",1488067200,,307,4.310344827586207

8289965,5,B001CUB8J4,"I saw this when it was first put on the History Channel and it freaked me out! To see those guys just walking down the street shooting at the police and just taking bullets like they were nothing is one of the most surreal things I've ever seen. It was expensive for a short video and you can watch it for free on You Tube but I had to have this one!

8289966,3,B001CUB8J4,"Unlike Mr Pixley's review i can say this is neither very good nor very accurate.
Yes it does tell the story of that infamous day in broad strokes, but ask yourself a question before you click the buy now button.
Surely when you part with hard earned cash you want an accurate documentary on the event right?
Im afraid you will only get a sloppily researched offering with this purchase, spruced up with some nice graphics to make it look credible.
For anyone with a knowledge of this event beyond the wikipedia entry you will find soon see the mistakes and contradictions in the timeline that is offered.
It is a pity that as a supposed impartial documentary that they did not explore the issue of one of the gunmen's deaths, or document at all any of the court cases, etc that came after the shooting stopped.

Worthy of purchasing only for the officers oral histories.",1270598400,6,870,4.576923076923077
