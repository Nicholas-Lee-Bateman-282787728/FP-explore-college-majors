8368557,4,B002EZLOGI,I bought this as a gift for my four year old nephew who loves cars. He was so excited to watch it. I was excited that he was learning valuable life lessons. I also like that the auto be good series is clean and safe for little ones. Cartoons and children's shows out there these days can say some inappropriate things. Auto Be good is perfect for children and appropriate. It also shipped quickly with Amazon Prime so it arrived in time for my nephew's birthday!,1472083200,,462,4.383720930232558

8368559,5,B002EZLOGI,"My grandson loves these DVD stories. The cars are charming and the lessons are appropriate for the todlers. Boys will enjoy them probably more than most girls, but little girls did watch with my grandson,",1373414400,,204,4.857142857142857
8368560,2,B002EZLOGI,"I was disappointed with this Auto B Good. The programs built on each other, but are not in the right order. A the main topic, war and dying to protect others was lost on my little ones (4yrs) and there was not even a comparison with Jesus dying to save us. Just missed its mark.  We won't watch it again, but I will get another DVD to replace it.",1361491200,,346,4.0144927536231885
8368561,5,B002EZLOGI,"This is a great show because they do not always teach just ""good"" morals but Jesus morals.  Good morals are to treat others slightly better than they treat you but ""Jesus Morals"" are to treat them how that you would want to be treated.",1301961600,,235,4.340909090909091
