8260767,4,B00164E6HC,Very simalar to Alpha Dog. But more buds. The slang is a little off. But what movie isn't a little off?,1363737600,,103,3.9523809523809526
8260768,4,B00164E6HC,"Kush makes sense as a flim.  I know the sentence, upon first reding it, is too brief.  I like the movie and the characters.  Comparing this to the Oliver Stone mess is simple.  Kush has no poorly acted homo erotic back story and these actors wanted the job.  If you all but cleared the chair to get away from Stone's film and enjoy a dope story this is a better film.",1352332800,,367,4.112676056338028
8260769,5,B00164E6HC,"I know alot of people saw Alpha Dog the big studio version from Warner Bros.,but, Kush is almost the same true story only told much better and less star-powered but still very well acted. If you liked Alpha Dog, I urge you to watch this and judge for yourself.",1318291200,,260,4.326530612244898
8260770,4,B00164E6HC,"I heard about this movie from people talking about how it was like Alpha Dog, and they are right, but it had a little independent film flair to it that you don't get with the big studio films.  It was a good week night flick!",1265673600,,225,4.0
8260771,4,B00164E6HC,"If you didn't know, this movie is going to be available on Video On Demand (VOD) starting December 1st, 2009 for a limited time, check your local listings!

I like to watch movies where the theme involves everyday situations, and action at the same time. Kush, in my opinion, is one of the movies that would get you a little closer to what a real world of a drug dealer is. And how with a slight mistake, can put his life on risk, and even all the money that he can get, won't be enough to stop his family, and friends to be destroyed.",1258934400,,535,4.144230769230769
