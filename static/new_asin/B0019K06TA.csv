""This 1975 performance includes ""Summer"" from Russian Dance Suite; Kalmyk Dance; Belorussian Dance Jurochka; Adjarian Warrior Dance; Russian Dance Polianka; Russian Cadrille; Partisans; Russian Dance; Moldavian Dance Tabakariaska; Uzbek Dance; Comic Dance ""  Lovely dances, but the cinematography is not up to today's standards.  You're better off watching the more recently taped on YouTube. It wouldn't play on my new computer.  I can't believe I spent $22 for this.

When I received an e-mail saying the dvd was not in stock, I attempted to cancel my order, but suddenly (perhaps miraculously) it was being prepared for shipment and I was stuck with it.",1428019200,2,831,5.297709923664122
8322294,5,B0019K06TA,"Dazzling spectacle for all dance lovers!  Russian dancers start with a spectacular Russian Folk dance, and then, with amazing mastery go dancing the World. Where did they learn to dance so true the dances of other nations? Aragon, Venezualian, Mexican, Greek, Argentinian, ... Everything is fabulous about the performances: costumes, choreography, and of course the great talents of the dancers.  I wish there were more than two volumes.",1391472000,3,437,5.411764705882353
