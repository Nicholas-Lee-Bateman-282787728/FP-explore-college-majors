7921281,5,B00004RFHW,"Radical Edward and Ein make an awsome team together in this riot filled epsiode of Cowboy Bebop. I couldn't stop laughing as she rode on that motor powered scooter and causing trouble for everybody on the scene. For the first and only time I saw her wearing socks but she took them off because she kept falling on her butt. She made the right choice cause I like to be barefooted too. I reconized some more talents of hers such as walking on her hands and rolling down the street in a doughnut shape. Too bad she was only used only as comedy relief, she and Ein would make a great spinoff cartoon like pretty Sammy. I hope the creator of Cowboy Bebop would do just that. Computers and being barefooted rules! Yea!",1006819200,,713,4.368421052631579
7921282,5,B00004RFHW,"Cowboy Bebop's best perks are its mass hilarity and wild imagination. It shows up again in ""Mushroom Samba."" The crew of the Bebop run out of provisions, so Ed and Ein set out in search of food. Afterwards, the two run into a seedy mushroom dealer named Domino that has a big bounty on his head. Ed and Ein race against two other bounty hunters to get the money. This is one of my favorite eps. because Edward personality shines brightest and she gets an episode almost to herself. The humor starts when the crew eats Domino's mushrooms, which result in hallucinations out of the ordinary.
""Speak Like A Child"" lets us look deeper into Faye's mysterious past. When the crew of the Bebop receives a beta tape, they have NO IDEA what it is. Remember, it's been awhile since these ""antiques"" have been used. Spike and Jet bring it to an antiques dealer obssessed with 20th century television shows to check it out. Faye watches the tape late one night and her curiousity is aroused by someone that looks almost like her.
Buy this VHS! I believe it contains two of the best episodes of Cowboy Bebop. Dedicated to Ed and Faye fans.",1006646400,,1126,4.5245098039215685
7921283,5,B00004RFHW,"When the Bebop crashes on a remote planet, Ed is stuck going out to find food with Ein. What develops is a funky episode complete with a Jamican, a Shaft brother and a Pam Greir look alike. Cool battles, trippy mushroom scenes and well done action scene involving a train. Now back to Faye. Faye recieves a beta tape from a delivery service. But this is the 2070's. VHS and BETA decks are rare. So Spike and Jet got to extra lengths to find one. Propably the only part on this tape where the dub doesn't work is for the tape otaku, but the dub for the Shaft brother and Pam Greir look alike are way better than the subtitled version, its almost scary how real it is. A fun and heartwarming volume that should be a must for anyone who likes afros, video tapes, scooter, little doggies and rocket launchers. Overall, the funniest volume ever on par with 'Cowboy Funk'. You gotta see it.",981849600,,884,4.363636363636363
7921284,5,B00004RFHW,"""Mushroom Samba"" is by far the funniest and most entertaining episode of Cowboy Bebop. The Bebop crew is out of food supplies, so the ship lands and Ed and Ein scavenge for food. Mass hilarity ensues as Edward and Ein bring back hallucinogenic mushrooms that the rest of the crew get trippy on in some of the funniest scenes ever to grace anime. The afros are exceptionally funny, and hey--it's Edward! This episode is *the* quintissential episode for Edward and Ein fans...a must-own!",981244800,,485,4.855421686746988
