7833607,4,6302993369,"This is the review for the VHS (it never came out on DVD that I know of) ""40th Anniversary Edition"" Playmate. Anna is really nice to look at and she is nude and clothed in various segments. She left me wanting more to see of her. That's a good sign for me. The two other ""runner's up"" are Julie Lynn Cialini and Traci Adell. Both very nice ladies as well as they would be nude quite often in their own segments. The bonus footage also was that of ""The Search"" with another former playmate, Julie Clark. It was a good program running about 50 minutes.",1487808000,,550,4.247619047619048
7833608,3,6302993369,"Playboy / Anna-Marie Goddard is fifty minutes long and was released on video on February 23, 1994. In my opinion, Anna-Marie is of the few Playmates that look sexy wearing clothes or no clothes. Anna-Marie Goddard is Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January 1994 and 40th Anniversary Playmate. Anna is seen in the first twenty-nine minutes and is only nude about 15% of the time. She left me wanting more. The other seventeen minutes are dedicated to the Runners-Up Bonus and the Anniversary Playmate search. Two future Playmates are introduced: first is Julie Lynn Cialini. Julie was Playboy's Playmate of the Month in February 1994 and Playmate of the Year in 1995. The second Playmate is Traci Adell; Playmate of the Month for July 1994. I saw more nudity with Traci and Julie combine then I did of Anna. Playboy / Anna-Marie Goddard get a C.",1246147200,,848,4.775510204081633
7833609,5,6302993369,I've gone through all the playmate centerfolds from Dec '53 to Dec'99. I love to say that Anna Marie Goddard is the most attractive and beautiful playmate I've ever seen. I'm looking forward to the future playmates to  challenge my point of view.,945734400,2,246,4.72093023255814
