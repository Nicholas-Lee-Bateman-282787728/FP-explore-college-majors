8014225,5,B00005B63Q,"Despite the Editor's comments about women, I went ahead and bought this movie. I found the women characters to be strong and involved in the plot of the movie, not meek. Perhaps the editor thought women working on the farm or in the house is demeaning somehow, but I saw these women having pride in their contributions and work. Just because it is ""women's work"", doesn't make it any less important. The plot moves because of Adnan's wife. And Muriel puts up strong arguments against Amin's concience. So my daughters can watch this movie without harm of negative role models.

Also, there is hardly any emphasis in Islam in this movie. Arab christians, who are about 50% of the Arab population, can see themselves in this movie. Half the characters have non-Muslim names. ""God"" is mentioned in English. The women wear scarves, not chadors or burqas, which is common... Christians and Hindus who live in similar ""mixed"" village settings often do cover their heads like their Muslim compatriots. Finally, the characters in this movie refer to the universal values of working hard, being honest, and pleasing their Lord.",1012780800,5,1118,4.946808510638298
