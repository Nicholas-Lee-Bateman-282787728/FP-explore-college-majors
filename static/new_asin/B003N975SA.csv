4156563,5,B003N975SA,"As is stated by Dr. Yang in the program, this video is a selection of Chin Na / White Crain techniques that are useful against strikes.  The content, as implied by the title, is a bit advanced for entry-level students or those without a background in either chin na, hapkido, aikido, or military/police come-along techniques.  I would recommend the novice first consider becoming familiar with the Shaolin Chin Na or Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na manuals and/or the Chin Na In Depth Course (DVD) before deciding to purchase this product.

In my opinion, the best part of this video is that you get all the benefits of going to a Dr. Yang seminar without having to foot the travel bill.  What's more, the DVD format allows you to go back and review whenever you require reference or clarification.  In practice, I use this video as a reference for specific technique-related questions and the DVD copy of Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na as a visual training aid to accompany practice.",1295136000,,977,4.757396449704142
4156564,5,B003N975SA,"As all the previous reviewers have alluded to, this DVD is an instructional masterpiece containing 33 very usable joint lock techniques and a few variations thrown in for good measure. There is no need to repeat the rave reviews and summaries given previously.  I would, however, like to caution the viewers that are unfamiliar with YMAAs joint lock curriculum.  With a YMAA skill level rating of 3, those unfamiliar with the specific techniques will probably miss many subtleties and nuances that are absolutely essential for these techniques to be effective.  I have personally attended seminars covering YMAA chin na material and these techniques are not easy, even for a 12-year veteran of traditional Chinese martial arts study.  This can be seen clearly in the DVD as Master Yang's senior students will make error after error even under his immediate guidance.  That being said, Dr. Yang repeatedly demonstrates the potential devastating effectiveness of this art upon mastery.  From his demonstrations alone I found this DVD to be very inspirational.

Of equal value to the techniques themselves are the bits of wisdom passed along to the viewer throughout the production.  Dr. Yang makes it very clear the amount of determination and practice that is required to achieve the fluidity that he is trying to transmit to the viewer.  Also, his demonstrations really signify the importance and necessity of acquiring and understanding other skill sets, such as ""sticky hands"" or ""push hands.""

I would highly recommend other YMAA instructional DVDs as supplements, if not precursors, to this one:  Taiji Pushing Hands Courses 1 & 2, Chin Na In Depth Courses 1-4, and Analysis of Shaolin Chin Na will all be terrific tutorials.  Additionally viewers will probably appreciate Taiji Chi Na In Depth and any of the other Chin Na In Depth Courses.",1292198400,5,1845,5.133779264214047
4156565,5,B003N975SA,"In the last decade, the traditional martial arts have realised the depth of grappling techniques contained in forms and kata, techniques that were, for many years, mistakenly considered to be a strange variety of punches, kicks and strikes.

Dr Yang's Advanced Chin Na gives a taster - albeit a sizeable one - of the depth of seizing, trapping, `sealing,' locking and throwing techniques in Chinese forms. He demonstrates 30 techniques with incredible names like `Butterfly Bores Through the Flowers', `Heavenly King Supports the Pagoda', `Spiritual Dragon Waves its Tail', and `Wild Chicken Breaks its Wing'. The names might sound fanciful, but the techniques are pragmatic and real.

Dr Yang takes us through a series of traps, locks, strangles and throws, but what makes this DVD a cut above the usual is the in-depth explanation that accompanies them. In these, Dr Yang considers the footwork and body-positioning required, the opponent's next attack, and how to maximise body-mechanics to make your technique more powerful.

Two of Dr Yang's students attempt each technique with varying degrees of success, which enables Dr Yang to highlight common mistakes and offer advice to correct them, adding yet another valuable layer of learning to the DVD.

Naturally, the techniques are taken from Chinese forms, notably southern White Crane, however the Chin Na on display also makes fascinating viewing for students of karate, especially those whose style contains a marked Chinese influence.

Beautiful, pragmatic techniques, masterfully shown and explained, Chin Na In Depth is a treasure trove of applications and principles on one DVD. Very highly recommended.

4156566,5,B003N975SA,"I will have to say that this investigation of Chin Na shows the similarities between Chin Na, Japanese aikido, and Russian systema.  It's really quite ironic how similar these systems actually truly are.  As hands-on combat systems, the same basic types of attacks were present in all 3 regions, and they used their own cultural and historical ""filters"" and developed similar defenses to these basic types of attacks.

As a long-time martial/combat artist, I can say that the only place I have ever had such a thorough course is during my in-person training from my long-time aikido sensei.  In other words, it was like attending a course from an old friend and trusted mentor.  Dr Yang's teaching method is practical and yet still casual and definitely approachable.

I also wanted to point out that Dr Yang also shows how these techniques can be used on individuals who are differently sized and even how to troubleshoot when things go wrong.  This is an absolutely great DVD packed with enough information to take many months, if not years, to absorb and put into practice.

Definitely a ""must buy!""",1290470400,,1102,4.887096774193548
4156567,4,B003N975SA,"Review of Advanced Practical Chin Na in Depth, by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming

Probably unlike many viewers of this Chin Na instructional series (likely because I came on as a reviewer, vs. as a typical consumer), I did not begin first with Dr. Yang's earlier instructional series. It became clear as I watched this DVD that I might have derived necessary and valuable information from starting at the beginning instead of with this more advanced format. To his credit, Dr. Yang makes pointed reference, throughout Chin Na in Depth, to his antecedent series for viewers who want to develop a solid foundation. Less experienced martial artists, as well as those newer to Chin Na, will not want to select this DVD as a starting point.

That said, as a longtime internal arts practitioner, I found there was much to be gleaned from the techniques and instruction offered here. Chin Na, of course, is fascinating on its merits. However, its technical attributes aside, the most engaging aspect of Dr. Yang's DVD is the author himself. I've always found Dr. Yang's casual and good-natured approach with viewers, and people in general, disarming (excuse the pun) and charismatic, this in noted contrast to instructional media I've witnessed from other teachers. I like the respectful manner in which he regards his helper students, not treating them as mere lackeys. Unlike many teachers who appear as stiff before the camera, or as overly bound by convention, Dr. Yang comfortably insinuates himself into the viewer's living room, or training hall.

Again, not having viewed the introductory level Chin Na series I don't know if some of my few minor concerns might already have been addressed in the earlier series. But I did find myself wishing for some up-close camera angles, as well as occasional slow-mo's for more detailed coverage. These minor shortcomings just mean that anyone trying to acquire the techniques covered will need to be a bit more observant and patient and try a bit harder, which can make for a great way to learn in any case. But the `stuff' is there, no question, so this DVD earns my recommendation.",1289779200,11,2114,4.949295774647887
4156568,5,B003N975SA,"Many years ago I owned a copy of the book Chin Na - In Depth. It was one of the first martial arts manuals I ever purchased, and it became dog eared over the years as I read it over and over again. I still remember the green cover and the hand-drawn depiction of a wrist lock on the cover.

Now thirty years later, I've had the pleasure of ""viewing the manual"" on DVD. What we learn in watching this DVD is the practical application of Chinese grappling. The movements are small and simple, and the camera work is such that you never miss a movement.

I found the instruction to be complete and easy to follow. From removing a choke hold to gently (or roughly) aiding an attacker in falling onto his back, this DVD has it all.

Dr. Yang has put out yet another high-quality product.",1287360000,2,782,4.27027027027027
4156569,5,B003N975SA,"If you have read the spot-on product description or any of the preceding reviews, this DVD has already been nicely summed up, so I won't bore the reader by reiterating a lot of what has already been said.

I WILL say that, as a long time customer of Dr. Yang's books and videos, I must say that this is DEFINITELY  a keeper!  Why?  (1) It has Dr. Yang actually explaining the techniques himself, not some narrator.  (2) The use of students who are just learning the techniques, which allows for Dr. Yang to make on-screen corrections of the very same types of mistakes that you yourself might make.  (3) The camera work and editing are excellent.  (4) The advanced nature of the material presented.

Recommendation:  This DVD will stand by itself for those who already have a strong background in Chin Na, Tuite, or perhaps Aiki-Jitsu.  BUT, if you don't have this kind of background I would recommend buying and studying Dr. Yang's earlier books and videos to more completely familiarize yourself with Shaolin Chin Na before you purchase this one.",1287100800,3,1048,4.740331491712707
4156570,5,B003N975SA,"I am never disappointed by an of Dr. Yang's instructional DVD's, and with the release of

""Advanced Practical""
CHIN NA
INDEPTH""

The streak continues.

Dr. Yang delivers where few others can.  His ability to transcend the television and conduct his training as though you are both in the same room is outstanding.  This is manifest in the interactions with his personal students.  After he,himself,demonstrates each move, along with an articulate narrative, he then has his students perform the move. -- I almost gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because of this.  It seemed to take away from the instruction when I sat down and watch the DVD as a whole.  But when I then move the furniture to the sides of the room and actually walk into Dr. Yang's classroom.  I began to take one move at a time and work on just one move at a time.  It was then that I realized how very helpful the mistakes (and subsequent corrections being made by Dr. Yang) made by his students were to me.

There are more than 30 moves and six months of training packed into this DVD.  It will prove very useful to any sophisticated martial arts practitioner.",1283817600,2,1131,4.544554455445544
4156571,5,B003N975SA,"As the title suggests, this is advanced work that is very practical. Dr. Yang repeats often that the distance between learning a technique and having it be practical in application is a very long road. There are no shortcuts. The techniques must be practiced diligently. These traps and seals can be practiced with a branch, so that you understand the sequence of the moves, however, they must also be practiced with a partner so that you will understand what happens when there is no cooperation.

Dr. Yang very clearly shows how to trap and seal joints and how to avoid dealing with the loose hand or foot. It does no good to trap and seal an opponents hand if he can still punch or kick from the opposite side. Much care is given to the angle of the trap. Dr. Yang demonstrated the proper way and then the errors that can occur if the angle is not correct. He then lets two men try the moves on each other. You get to see what happens if one is taller, faster, or more advanced in technique. After the technique misses, for any reason, he moves in and shows how to make the correction. For example, if one person is taller, you must bring him down to your height with an elbow or wrist trap before you can wrap around the neck and choke out.

Which brings me to the next thought. Young kids or over eager adults viewing this video might be tempted to choke out, or use the pressure points and take the drills too far. This is extremely dangerous and care should be take to understand these moves and do them slowly.

I also like how Dr. Yang adapts some of the chin na for weaker people, older, women, people with less strength or small hands. He shows how one move where you lock around three fingers of the opponents hand and pull might not be possible if any of the previous conditions exist. The camera moves in closely and he demonstrates how to drop two of the fingers and lock and trap on only one.

This video is to be used after learning the basic techniques of chin na from Dr. Yang's previous  books, videos and workshops. It is not to be used by the uninformed player, as it is powerful stuff. I would hate to see any broken fingers, elbows or worse yet, necks!
A great teaching tool, if used with care under the proper supervision.",1282780800,4,2247,4.353221957040573

Most of the Chin Na techniques are said to come from White Crane.

Dr. Yang first demonstates each technique on a student and then watches and corrects 2 students who are working on the techniques.

The key message in learning Chin Na is: intercept, get in, trap, control and then practice, practice, practice with a partner.
Dr. Yang is teaching Chin Na ideas. His message is to keep thinking and understanding the techniques. Is it practical Anticipate how the enemy will react and never expect your enemy to cooperate with you.
