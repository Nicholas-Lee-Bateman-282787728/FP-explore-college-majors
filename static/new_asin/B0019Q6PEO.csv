plus it brought back memories of my childhood with our old Airedale hound dog named Tramp.  We did not ever know how old he was since my dad found him out in the orange groves of California. He loved to chase Foxes, Rabbits, Squirrels even challenged a coyote to a fight.  He was about 120 Lbs and was more than match for any 4 legged varmint. One of my saddest days was having to put him down he got to old hunt and could not even walk his teeth were gone and eating was problem for him as well agewize about (16)  But getting back to the movie of you like dog movies then this one for you. To bad it is not in color but maybe that is a good thing. Unlike todays so called movies this is one you can watch with the family and more than once.",1300665600,5,823,3.9696969696969697

I feel the acting is very good compaired to what they are doing today. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.,1215388800,11,267,4.36
