8258914,4,B0015LBP16,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released.  And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events.  These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

Royal Rumble:
The 16th annual edition of this event was highlighted by the traditional Royal Rumble match but with a different twist as this was the first Rumble match since the RAW/SmackDown ""brand extension"" with each brand having a separate World Championship so the Rumble would have have 15 members from each brand with the winner facing his brand's champion at WrestleMania as the match itself had it's various moments such as Shawn Michaels & Chris Jericho beginning the match, the Hardys first time in the ring together since Matt turned on Jeff months earlier, and the return of The Undertaker with Maven attempting to have ""deja vu."" After months of being pursued by both Eric Bischoff & Stephanie McMahon, Scott Steiner signed with the RAW brand with the only condition being that he would be granted a World Championship Match against Triple H here in what has gone down as one of the worst matches in the history of this event. On the same card as one of the worst was one of the best WWE Championship matches of all time as Kurt Angle defended the title against Chris Benoit in a near 20 minute classic match just based off pure in-ring technical wrestling alone. Other matches include Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show with the winner gaining entrance in the Royal Rumble match later in the night, Tag Team Champions William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Dudley Boyz, and Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie.

No Way Out:
WWE returned to Montreal for a PPV for the first time since the infamous Survivor Series 1997 for their final stop on the Road To WrestleMania XIX. The main event saw the returns of both Hulk Hogan & The Rock in a rematch from their WrestleMania match a year earlier only with both men switching roles as The Rock wasn't the fan favorite going into the match while Hogan was with Hogan's constant problems with Mr. McMahon playing a factor. After Mr. McMahon gave Eric Bischoff 30 days to make an impact on the RAW brand, his reward for it was the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin in a match against Bischoff that was the pure definition of ""opening a can of whoop-ass!"" Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, Charlie Hass) went into what was originally scheduled to be a six man tag against Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit & Edge but became a handicap match when Edge was attacked earlier in the night in what was a not only a preview of their upcoming matches at Mania but also the match where Kurt suffered his first neck injury that would begin a series of problems throughout the rest of his WWE career. Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Scott Steiner, Undertaker vs. Big Show, Crusierweight Champion Billy Kidman vs. Matt Hardy, World Tag Team Champions William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Kane & Rob Van Dam, and Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy.

In the end, the road before WrestleMania XIX was a strong one and these two PPV events showcase that.  This is the one series of ""Tagged Classic"" events (so far) that your actually getting a bargain on for paying such a low price for two quality events.  I recommend.",1219449600,2,3437,4.597063621533442
8258915,4,B0015LBP16,"I just wrote a review on the ""BACKLASH/JUDGMENT DAY"" Tagged Classic set, where I basically wondered why in the world WWE would re-release those PPVs.  But then I saw this package deal, and realized the WWE might be onto something.  The ""ROYAL RUMBLE/NO WAY OUT"" combo is a good buy, with only a few restrictions.

Here's a quick recap of the PPVs:
*  ROYAL RUMBLE 2003
---In my opinion, the absolute best of the Royal Rumble PPVs.  Everybody knows about the Angle/Benoit classic.  Also, I think most will agree the 30-Man Royal Rumble Match is one of the best.  This 30-Man Rumble isn't just a battle royal where a bunch of guys pile up.  There's some good wrestling, funny moments, and few shockers as well.  The undercard for the PPV is also pretty good.  Brock Lesnar and Big Show have a fun opener, there's a solid World Tag Team Titles contest, & even Dawn Marie and Torrie Wilson have a Divas Match that isn't just a catfight (they actually try to wrestle!).  Overall, I really like this PPV, and consider it one of 2003's best.

NO WAY OUT 2003
---Overall a decent card, but by the end, we've got some problems.  First off, the undercard is pretty good.  Jeff Hardy and Chris Jericho's opener is a treat, as is the World Tag Team Titles Match.  However, 3 of the 4 main events don't deliver.  Team Angle's 3-on-2 Handicap against Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit is pretty good; all 5 of those guys were exceptional athletes back then.  However, Rock/Hogan II wasn't nearly as much fun as their Toronto classic.  Stone Cold's WWE return is predictabily a relentless beatdown squash on Eric Bischoff.  And the HHH/Steiner rematch was just as disappointing as their ""ROYAL RUMBLE"" matchup.  There are some good matches here, but this PPV runs out of gas by the end.

So we get one excellent PPV and one average PPV for an awesome price.  However, there are a few reasons you might want to pass this offer up:
*  Angle/Benoit is available on Chris Benoit's ""HARD KNOCKS"" DVD, and the ""ROYAL RUMBLE ANTHOLOGY: VOL. 4"" DVDs.  Both of those are worth the investment.
*  WWE hasn't added any Extras to these DVDs.  They are the original 2003 releases, which weren't filled with great bonuses to begin with.
*  ""NO WAY OUT 2003"" is not worth buying if you already own ""ROYAL RUMBLE 2003"".  It's not bad, but I wouldn't lose sleep over it.

It comes down to this: if you want to see ""ROYAL RUMBLE 2003"" for a great price, then pick this up.  But if you're just curious about ""NO WAY OUT 2003"", you might be disappointed.",1209859200,3,2513,4.532293986636971
