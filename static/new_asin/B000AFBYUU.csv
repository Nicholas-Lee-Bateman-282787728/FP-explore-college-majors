8078392,5,B000AFBYUU,"This is the WORST Vietnam war movie ever made! Sit and let this sink in a moment. For sheer medicraty this even blows Mean Combat (with the Harley Trike in the jungle) and anything by Chuck Noris out of the water. Everything about this is wrong. From the paintball park it was shoty in to the overly boppy soundtrack. The fact that one of the characters is meant to be Australian is shown him using a F88 Austyre (or a standard AUG, but I'm not that knit picky). I loved the ""Secret Australian base behind the VC lines"". I didn't know the VC even had lines. The VC seemed to look Mexican and had safari suits. If Search lights and 11 x 11 tents is a secret base the VC are all too blind to cause any real damage. No wonder the tunnel had no light, the VC wouldn't even notice the differance. 2 men fighting to romantic music is something I never want to see again. There is too much for 1 lunch break, think of this movie as the second coming of ED Wood.
My favorite bit has to be the grenade in the big climax. A soldier throws a grenade into a tent as he runs past. That in itself is not a good career move. The ground explodes into flame like no grenade I've ever thrown ever does. But in the bottom right of the screen you can see the grenade bouncing away! This is a tribute to movie schlock and not to be missed by all fans of the truly dreadful.",1358640000,,1352,4.086466165413534
8078393,5,B000AFBYUU,"I remember renting this movie from our local video store back in the late 80s / early 90s.  It's a horrible production!  It might be the worst movie ever made, certainly the worst I have ever seen.  It's so bad that all these years later I can still remember it!  It makes Plan 9 seem like a big budget blockbuster.  Which is why I HAD OWN TO A COPY!  It's so bad that you absolutely MUST HAVE IT!",1323475200,,397,4.0256410256410255
