8453247,3,B0051T480S,Just a regular episode of Sesame street that I now have to watch at least three times a day. No special features just one whole episode including journey to Erine and Elmo's World. I believe the Elmo's world is the bath time one.,1399593600,,229,4.348837209302325
8453248,5,B0051T480S,I rented this movie at our local library. And our ten month old absolutely loved it. before this she watched only Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. I have bought a total of four Sesame movies now and she only loves two of them. This one and the best of elmo. I highly recommend this movie for toddlers. We can't live without ours :-),1376438400,,323,4.311475409836065
