5451266,1,B00AMHFQA0,"sucked. terrible even for a student film. poor acting and videography. we stopped watching 4 minutes into it.
writing this review is more enjoyable than those 4 minutes i just wasted.",1374624000,2,183,4.935483870967742
5451267,5,B00AMHFQA0,"Finally watched BLED WHITE on DVD. Written and directed by Jose Carlos Gomez staring North Roberts who I've had the pleasure of meeting and had lunch with. This movie is awesome from beginning to end. There are some scenes that North had me laughing. Unpredictably amazing Zombie movie. Never knew what was coming next, for example ""the ending"". Never thought that they were gonna do that. If you wanna know what I'm talking about?!?!  **Yajusgonnahavtahsee4yoself.com**",1373932800,3,470,5.266666666666667
5451268,5,B00AMHFQA0,"This is an amazing film! It's got everything a fan of zombie movies could want -- great FX, suspense, and horror -- plus a story that's unique and interesting. BLED WHITE offers a twist on the zombie genre, and invites us to ponder what life would be like in a post-zombie apocalypse world. How does a person survive, not only physically but also emotionally and mentally? Could we make the tough choices that living in this new and horrifying world would require?

The performances really make this film, taking an already intriguing story and elevating it to something truly memorable. Actor North Roberts, as Ed in the lead role, gives audiences a protagonist to cheer for and sympathize with; Collen Boag, as Natalie, is simultaneously strong yet fragile, and a pleasure to watch on screen. It is easy to see why both stars have won awards for their performances in this film, and are rising stars in the indie film scene. (Both also appear in the film PLASTIC, also by director/writer Jose Carlos Gomez, another movie that gives a fresh take on what can be a well-worn genre.)

If you love zombie films -- or if you just love great movies, period! -- treat yourself to BLED WHITE.",1373846400,4,1185,4.6923076923076925
5451269,1,B00AMHFQA0,"Are you kidding me? FRIGGIN AWFUL. Could have been good, but the acting was atrocious. Good story and plot line, but poorly executed. I wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I only made it half way through. Disappointing to say the least.",1372809600,2,234,4.7317073170731705
5451270,5,B00AMHFQA0,The Dead live on the flesh of the living.  Think you seen this before?  You're in for a big shock.  The film a very stylish horror film with many surprises.  You won't be disappointed.,1366070400,4,184,4.323529411764706
5451271,2,B00AMHFQA0,"I watch a lot of zombie movies and have seen a lot worse than this one, but it had no real plot and the few zombies in the movie had amateur effects. If you don't see this movie you won't be missing anything.",1392422400,3,208,3.86046511627907
5451272,5,B00AMHFQA0,"One of the best Zombie independent flicks I've seen. The story isn't all gore or zombie driven. It's a nice change of pace. Besides Zombies-Winter- Blood, what's not to like.",1387584000,,174,4.833333333333333
5451273,3,B00AMHFQA0,"I enjoyed the movie and it was a cheap rental so what is there not to like? It apparently won a bunch of awards, probably for cheaply made independent ""spooky"" movies..I don't know. It is worth a watch though and I do recommend it if you don't have anything else to do.",1384300800,2,269,4.1923076923076925
5451274,1,B00AMHFQA0,Way too much character development with moderate to bad acting making that worse.  Not nearly enough action or new angles.  I love Zombie movies and I'd have to say this one was an utter and complete waste of time.  These sleps almost made a movie.,1381017600,2,248,4.466666666666667
5451275,1,B00AMHFQA0,"Please don't waste your time or money on this film. I could not really find any redeeming quality to this film. I watch pretty much anything. However, this film, well, It takes itself way too seriously to be any good to anyone! I personally feel that we need to find another intrinsic fear these days other than any story surrounding a  Zombie apocalypse. Overkill with no pun intended. Fast zombies, slow zombies, tied up & loved family zombies that still require feeding, demonic zombies, true love zombies, curing zombies, killing zombies, genetically grown zombies, intelligent zombies, zombies that remember, unborn or baby zombies, pet zombies, militarized zombies, space zombies, Natzi zombies,  or almost any other combo has been accomplished. Please stop! Seriously! JUST STOP! I think once the Walking Dead is over we should take a break and see other people! Its not me its you, zombies! I need some space!",1378425600,3,917,5.066225165562914
5451276,3,B00AMHFQA0,I'd give them all an A for effort on a small budget. Some of the actors were terrific and some terrible but they all tried and that's appreciated. I watch anything zombie and have seen much worse and much better and put this in the middle as it did create an atmosphere of dread.,1377820800,4,279,4.185185185185185

These guys can run.  Good story line.  Many small stories that come together in the end. Enough scares and edge of your seat moments to make a good horror movie.  Found it entertaining.  Characters pull you in.  They have enough faults to be believable.  You see how each handles the situations of a world gone mad,and you hope that they will somehow survive.",1376697600,2,530,6.277777777777778
5451278,4,B00AMHFQA0,I was forced by circumstance to watch this movie over the course of several days and each day I grew in interest. For a movie to hold and even grow my interest is pretty good.,1376611200,3,175,4.0285714285714285
5451279,1,B00AMHFQA0,"So bad! Not sure how this movie even ended up on amazon. Low budget, everyone had midwest accents, and obviously no one had ever taken an acting class. Some of the makeup effects were neat....",1376438400,2,192,4.514285714285714
5451280,1,B00AMHFQA0,"This movie totally sucks, unless you are a fan of canibalism and you like feeding corpses. yuck.
I've watched zombie movies since I was a teen and now they are soooo popular. But it seems that people don't really know how to make a zombie movie and EVERYONE'S making them now.
rule one: you don't kill the first person you meet
rule two: you never feed a chained up zombie, I don't care it It's your brother!
rule three: If you meet people that do this then you shoot them in the head and take their food.
What is the point of surviving the zombie horde if you become like them. (oops, I just went Romero there for a second.)
Don't watch this shit.",1374883200,,648,4.233870967741935
8553775,5,B00AMHFQA0,"I so enjoyed this film. I was really moved by the characters and their plight. This is a movie is about love, humanity, and being in survival mode. Sharon DC",1508976000,,157,4.266666666666667
8553776,5,B00AMHFQA0,"If you like the Zombie genre, this one is a little different and really good.",1500508800,,77,4.2
8553777,4,B00AMHFQA0,"I stumbled across this title while searching for some new-to-me horror flicks to watch over Halloween weekend. I cannot pass up the chance to watch a flick about the hungry undead, so I decided to give this one a try.

It is obvious that this film was made on a low budget, but I was surprised by the quality of the acting and the writing. This isn't a slick theatre movie. It has a sepia look to it that enhances how cold and desolate the environment is for the remaining humans who are trying to survive. There are some humorous lines and some tense running-from-the-zombies moments, but there aren't any huge scares. There is a decent amount of gore, and I like that these zombies are fast (seriously, even I could outrun a zombie that can barely get beyond a shuffle). If you want nonstop action and gore, then look elsewhere because this movie doesn't provide those. However, if you are a horror fan, especially a zombie fan, this is certainly worth your time. Personally, I like to watch something a bit fresh and different in the horror genre and these low-budget independent films are often the ones that deliver these days.",1446249600,,1132,4.603960396039604

8553780,5,B00AMHFQA0,"This zombie flick is one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen. You have to watch without comparing to other zombie movies. The writing is brilliant. The characters are believable and the zombies are rad. It's a must have for your zombie collection! I noticed there's another movie out by the same director, Jose Carlos Gomez, called ""Plastic""....it's my next purchase. Brains.......",1408233600,,386,5.142857142857143
8553781,1,B00AMHFQA0,"This is such a bad film that I have been driven to write my FIRST EVER review of a movie or book!  I like to consider myself a fan of the Apocalyptic, End of World, Zombie genre.  The Stand, Swan Song, 28 Days Later and World War Z would be books and/or movies which I would consider worthy of a 5 Star Rating.  If you share the same opinions of the books and/or movies listed above you would agree with me 100% that all this film accomplishes is to steal away an hour and a half of your life that you can never get back. I am horrified that I contributed to the posssible revenue, no matter how minimal, this ""movie"" may have made.  Don't let the ""Awards"" listed at the top of the Film Poster fool you.  Bled White is a horrible ""movie"" which made me ""Bleed Tears"", a possible accurate or alternative title for this...whatever it was.",1406419200,3,835,4.226415094339623
8553782,5,B00AMHFQA0,This movie is very interesting. Give it a try. I am into horror and things of that nature and it won a bunch of awards. It's worth watching!,1402704000,,140,4.035714285714286
8553783,3,B00AMHFQA0,Rented this on because I have seen about ever zombie moive out there------ was ok have seen alot worse than this one---if you are bored give it a look,1394150400,,150,4.206896551724138
8553784,1,B00AMHFQA0,Nothing good or clever about this film. Don't waste your time renting it. I really get annoyed when people give this kind of crap 5 stars.,1392422400,4,138,4.346153846153846
