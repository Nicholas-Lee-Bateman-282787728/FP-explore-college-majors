2863201,5,B000R9YLJ0,"If you have been faithfully practicing Yoga and have a good basis in Pilates then this workout will take you to new levels. I found this workout very satisfying, as it is a combination of Vinyasa-style Yoga and Pilates. The exercises strengthen and tone the entire body while you can literally feel the fat melting off. This is a fat burning style of Pilates as you are moving from the floor to standing all throughout the workout.

Plank, Cobra and Downward Facing Dog form the basis of the workout and give a good upper body workout. In 45 minutes you will be doing the following exercises:

Cat/Cow
Active Moving Cat
Swimming
Chair
Side Plank
Teaser
Bicycle
Scissors
Bridge
Single Leg Kicks
Rollover
Pelvic Lift with Leg Extension
Double-Leg Stretch
Single-Leg Pull

A rolling Teaser and moving Bridge make the moves more challenging. Throughout the workout the cueing is beautifully precise. Alanna Zabel has a pleasant personality and her voice is very calming.

While the first half of the exercises require a lot of upper body strength, it is worth the effort. This may be slightly wrist intensive at the start but you can always rest in Child's pose for a few seconds to relieve the arms and wrists.

I can highly recommend this to anyone moving from intermediate to advanced. This workout will help you burn calories and keep you strengthened and toned all over. If you want to continue working out after the main workout there is a six-minute super intense abs blaster workout.

8199798,2,B000R9YLJ0,"I've taken pilates classes before and done various pilates and yoga DVDs. I didn't expect this to be a strictly pilates video (it's based on both pilates and yoga, which is obvious from the ""For Fat Burning"" part of the title).

The choreography is fine. I like the incorporations of the different elements of pilates and yoga. However, she goes back to Downward Dog way too often. Halfway through the workout, I had to stop because my wrists were hurting and I was starting to get a headache from being upside down so often.

The videographer should have shot from different angles, because you see the instructor (and her back-up people) mostly from one angle, and sometimes it was hard to tell about depth (how much they were bending in one direction relative to another, etc).

If you want an aerobic, pilates-based workout, try Crunch Fitness' ""Fat-Burning Pilates"" instead.",1293753600,,879,4.885906040268456
8199799,4,B000R9YLJ0,"This is a unique workout because it blends a Yoga flow with Pilates moves in fast tempo and high reps!  So this makes it a toning, strengthening, and cardio workout.  From the mat, you'll have a modifier to follow as well as intermediate & advanced models.  The transitions were excellent, didn't strain or make me dizzy. The choreography is excellent.  The basic routine flow of the workout is in the beginning, there is a Yoga flow/sun salutation, then you'll move onto mainly Pilates moves and doing reps, then go back to the Yoga flow, and keep alternating.  You'll do quite a number of ab crunches when you are in a teaser and the plank, among many others.  This focuses highly on the core/abs because you'll do twists and rotations, meaning oblique crunches, just like in the cover photo.  This is one of my favorite floor mat work because of the element of adding crunches.  If you want a quick 5-6 minute ab extra check out the BONUS SECTION FOR ABS. It has quick and high reps. Highly recommended as a unique alternative to a regular Pilates workout.",1276041600,,1059,4.625668449197861
8199800,2,B000R9YLJ0,"This is an annoying DVD workout.  I've tried it a couple of times, and I'm in decent shape - I've belonged to a gym for over 20 years, have taken numerous yoga and mat pilates classes, and I'm not overweight at all.  I wanted a workout I could do at home when I don't have time for the gym, and I wanted pilates.  But, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this is not pilates - it's yoga.  There are a lot of really challenging moves in here, and I just don't know how anyone getting acquainted with pilates could do them.

For instance, early in the workout, you are asked to do a plank and then raise one leg in back and just hover there for a long time, then lower your arms and be on your knees while keeping your leg up.  Not a move that is so simple, especially for the novice.  I actually found this workout induces dizziness and nausea, because you spend so much time dropping back to the floor and looking downward.  Very frustrating, and though I'm not in super-duper shape, I'm in better shape than many who would attempt this, yet I find it a difficult, practically impossible workout to do in the way that she's instructing.

I wish I had bought a better DVD for Pilates.  I'll have to keep trying.",1253923200,,1221,4.269565217391304
8199801,3,B000R9YLJ0,"After using the library copy of this video, I bought it purely for the Mini Ab-Blaster that is included in the bonus features. It is about 10 minutes long, and has amazing results. You really feel it the next day!",1236556800,,213,4.35
8199802,4,B000R9YLJ0,"This is a nice 45 minute workout that heats you up and stretches you out, while developing strength. Reminds me of a favorite yoga class, but is right in my home! too soon to tell if the fat is burning off, but it feels good. I wish there were a music option once you get the routine down.",1224374400,,289,4.0
8199803,2,B000R9YLJ0,"I was very disappointed with this video to be quite honest.  I have been doing pilates for years, both in the studio/gym setting and also pilates dvds and found this to be more yoga than pilates.  It was very hard on my wrists constantly going from the plank to childs pose etc..  If you are a yoga enthusiast and looking to venture out into pilates, this might be the video for you, but if you are looking for a vigorous mat-based pilates workout, I'd pick something else.  I love Ana Caban's Cardio Pilates to get my core workout.",1205020800,,532,4.3979591836734695
8199804,5,B000R9YLJ0,"This workout is good for tummies.  Next day after I did the work out, I could feel it in my stomach area.  I like it.",1195171200,,117,3.64
8199805,2,B000R9YLJ0,"I was not happy with this product. I was expecting something that would be more fat-burning-like, as the name suggests. Instead, it's more like regular Pilates, except hardcore, causing you to really work hard. It's not really fast-paced at all and it is not at all similar to other DVDs, titled ""Fat-burning"". In general, I would only recommend it to someone who is looking for an in-depth Pilates workout, but not particularly a fat-burning one.",1193702400,,447,4.973333333333334
