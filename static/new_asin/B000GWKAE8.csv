8134956,1,B000GWKAE8,"(Note: I posted this review a couple years ago and it somehow got moved to the ""book"" section under this same title...)

The most relentlessly nihilistic, intentionally disturbing wannabe art-house vomit ever made. So totally devoid of humanity it should be erased from history. The impression is that the film was intentionally made to worsen the viewer's life to somehow even the playing field of all human existence out of some sort of morally relativistic sense of justice. It doesn't. Whether the film-maker had this intention or not makes no difference. The end result is inhumane garbage. The act of creating suffering or pain for another person doesn't guarantee any kind of revelation on the part of the one enduring the pain. I understand the value of shock. I understand our need for art to wake people up. I agree that our world is often relentlessly harsh. But no matter how noble the intentions, this film makes things worse. Garbage on garbage.",1341100800,3,959,4.919753086419753

8134958,2,B000GWKAE8,"Hey, why not make a flick where amateur porn is a theme?  I loved the hot male nudity here.  Foreign male actors must be much more comfortable with that than their American counterparts.  The director character has a very sexy, hairy chest.  This film is arthouse in that it's non-linear with fast-forwarding and tangentially related images popping up everywhere.  I never read Sartre's ""No Exit"" but in the way that the three main characters seem trapped in a space, I wonder if that book was the influence.  This movie also moved slowly compared to Hollywood fare.  If you like experimental, indie, foreign, somewhat highbrow stuff, you might like this.",1224979200,3,655,4.954128440366972
