8356596,2,B0028P7LRA,"I had two problems with this DVD. First: My IMAC computer disc drive was almost ruined by the disc (rub,rub,rub,rub)when I tried to play the DVD. Refund in progress...
  Second: This DVD does not provide meaningful ""tips for advanced players"". The presentation of the various tips are great, but the target audience should/could be the advanced NOVICE player at best.
  I am 50 years old and have been playing this game off and on since 1975. I had hoped this DVD would give me some visual insights to get beyond ""B"" level play.  Along with the DVD, I also purchased Championship Racquetball by Fran Davis & Jason Mannino. The detail and depth of subject their book provides seems to be just what I was looking for.",1306713600,4,715,4.642857142857143
