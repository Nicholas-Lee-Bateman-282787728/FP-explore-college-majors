8246293,5,B0012K53MC,"As proud Italian Americans, my mother and I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd. Italians have and continue to make many contributions to our country. Best of all, the immigrants came to the United States LEGALLY. My grandparents did. Their courage to leave Italy and take that long journey on a ship, land at Ellis Island, not speaking/knowing English is truly remarkable! I am proud to be Italian American. I only wish my grandparents were still alive as I loved their stories. Imagine, coming to a strange land and learning how to be American. Nonna passed away at 104, her stories were so interesting. She saw so much in her lifetime. Both grandfathers were born in late 1800's! They worked hard, owned their own businesses and not in the Mafia. This dvd excellently portrays hard working and accomplished Italians. I had no idea Italians contributions to the United States go as far back to George Washington. This dvd is a must-have for everyone, not only Italians.",1401926400,,963,4.878048780487805
