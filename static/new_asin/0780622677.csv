31296,5,0780622677,"This movie is a must have for Chan fans. Personally I love his younger stuff, but once he gets control over the choreography and stunts, you can't be disappointed with the outcome. This movie is worth having for the ladder fight sequence alone. It's got his humorous antics in it, which is why I love Jackie Chan movies they aren't tense the whole time. It is a fun family movie with really great action sequences.",1428364800,,414,4.533333333333333
31297,1,0780622677,I love Jackie Chan and his movies. I bought This DVD used which I do often off Amazon. Amazon Which has Awesome customer service and really takes good care of the customer.  When the DVD arrived I opened the package and not only did the case have wear and tear on it but the DVD had a big scratch on it as well,1417996800,,310,3.9206349206349205
31298,3,0780622677,"Jackie Chan's First Strike, also known as Police Story 4: First Strike, is probably the weakest of the series thus far. The movie opens with an entertaining James Bond-ish scene in the snow to get you going, but takes it's time before it heats up again. The whole theme of the Police Story movies have changed dramatically.

The first two were true Hong Kong action police detective movies, but starting with Supercop, Chan seemed to change the direction of the films, heading more towards a Bond-like movie. In fact the final underwater fight scene in First Strike is definitely an homage to Thunderball, a Sean Connery James Bond movie. Besides that there is really only one more notable action scene in the film, which would be the scene where Jackie visits Annie to tell her he is innocent.

Here Chan exhibits that clearly, he is a master of his environment. Jackie uses almost every single prop in each setting to thwart and disarm his attackers. These incredible acrobatic feats are something that over the years has become a staple in Jackie Chan's martial arts style and is something that keeps people coming back to see his movies.",1400198400,2,1141,4.786802030456853
31299,3,0780622677,"Jackie Chan's First Strike(1997) is the fourth installment in the Police Story film series. It was released in Hong Kong in 1996. New Line Cinema released the film in North America in early 1997. The film emulates a lot of material from James Bond movies. There's a skiing scene that's an homage to A View to a Kill(1985). First Strike is a fair amount of fun and it's better than some of the movies Chan made after the year 2000. Maggie Cheung is not in the film, but there is a cute Chinese girl who is a fraction of Chan's age! In the film, the thin plot features Chan Ka Kui(Jackie Chan) trying to stop the Russian Mafia from getting their hands on a themonuclear warhead. Parts of the film were filmed in Australia and are already in English. There's mechanical sharks that can back up and only one real kung fu fight in the film. The Hong Kong version had a subtle, lifeless music score. New Line hired J. Peter Robinson to compose an energetic music score for the film. Some of the Australian scenes use a dijeridoo sound. Even in the 1990's, Jackie Chan was getting older. Instead of a climactic kung fu fight, the last half features Chan driving a car into the air and smashing it into the bad guy's sail boat. Jackie Chan's First Strike(1997) is worth buying if you see it in a shopping center bargain bin.",1367107200,,1316,4.419753086419753
31300,4,0780622677,"Jackie Chan use to do stunts for Bruce Lee so this guy knows his stuff. This movie is heavily dubbed so beware, but it is still too good to care entirely. It is a really funny movie! I wasn't expecting it the first time I watched it. There are some really terrific fight scenes too. Really classic Jackie Chan. If you love his movies be sure to not miss this one!",1312416000,,363,4.126760563380282
31301,4,0780622677,"This was the movie I saw as a kid that got me interested in kung-fu movies. I was impressed with how Jackie Chan was able to combine highly stylized martial arts and dangerous stunts with silent comedy slapstick. Like many Chan films, the plot is thin but the action is fun and hard not to laugh out loud at. It's an awesome ride that takes you from Russia to Australia.",1308096000,,370,4.3
31302,2,0780622677,"I watched the Chinese version of this movie on youtube before. The story line goes Jackie Chan, a Hong Kong police officer going to Ukraine to Russia to Australia. Movie itself is fine one of typical Jackie Chan movies. In Chinese version they use languages by the location of scene in Chinese, English and Russian which were more realistic. I expected to hear at least some Russian with English captions on this DVD but they were all overdubbed English voice through entire movie, which felt like watching a cheap movie on TV.",1303084800,,527,4.739130434782608
31303,5,0780622677,"As many of you Jackie Chan fans may already know (and those who aren't fans are about to find out), Chan has his own uniqueness that makes him one of a kind.  One of the elements about his action films that makes Jackie Chan, ""Jackie Chan"", is the humor.  In ""Jackie Chan's First Strike"" we get to see some humor, but what there is more of is just pure fun.  Where most of the fun lies, is in some of the coolest action scenes in any Chan film.

First Strike is basically part 4 in the popular Police Story series, arguably the best series of movies with Chan.  Police Story 1 & 2 had a decent amount of comedy, but also a lot of seriousness.  Supercop was quite serious.  First Strike is the most fun out of the bunch, but has its serious moments too.  As mentioned earlier, its the action that is so much fun.  Plenty of scenes from beginning to end that will surely thrill from a great ski/snowboarding scene in the beginning, chases & fights, the incredible & famous ""ladder fight"" scene, and the incredible fun and somewhat humerous aquarium underwater scene.

The plot in First Strike is actually not all that dull, but might seem a little common for a Chan film.  Jackie is hunting down some people who are dealing with nuclear weapons, and ends up working on the wrong side by mistake.  The action picks up in the movie when he discovers he was working for the bad guys, he's a wanted man, and they begin to come after him.  The English dubbing, though not great, is satisfying for a Chan film, actually helping in bringing out the fun factor.

Arguably the best scene in the movie, and of the best Jackie Chan scenes ever, is the famous ladder scene (although the particular fight is not limited to just a ladder).  It is truly amazing to see what can become a weapon and how he uses them with such incredible choreography that is intelligently used to make a simple brawl just an outright blast.  The honorable mention scene is the finale, which is an underwater fight at an aquarium.  Chan provides some cool underwater martial arts action at times, as well as plenty of comic relief when attempting to avade the shark in the aquarium.  There is no big stunt scene like in some of his other movies, but the biggest are jumping from a cliff onto a helicopter and taking a red sprts car off a ramp and into a movie boat.

For a Jackie Chan fan, this is a must for the collection.  First Strike is just an all-out fun film that anyone can enjoy, and most likely will.  Oh yeah, and there is a scene where he is forced to sing naked outside ""I will follow you...""  Just hilarious.",1182556800,3,2587,4.368200836820083
31304,5,0780622677,"Near the beginning of the movie there is a downhill ski chase scene like straight out of a James Bond movie.  Later Jackie even says ""I feel just like James Bond, only no gorgeous girls,"" but the next scene we get to see the gorgeous girl.  This is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies, I guess partly because I also like James Bond.  As usual, Jackie does some great stunts and amazing fighting scenes.",1170115200,,404,4.36
31305,4,0780622677,"This is not one the best stories you will ever find in a Chan movie but it has some of the best and funniest moments i have ever seen in his movies the classic ladder scene is my second favorite fight scene ever made ,the first being a tie betwenn the axe gang and final fights in drunken mast II, also the underwater kung-fu is great there are also some funny 007ish moments like the whole snow mobile ski scene also the fsb agents so in all this is a good fun movie!",1147824000,3,468,4.043010752688172
31306,4,0780622677,"Every time I watch Jackie Chan, I have to wonder:  How does he do this stuff?  He's just phenomenal.  If you don't like Chan, that's fine, but if you aren't impressed by his amazing acrobatic grace and wild imagination, I feel sorry for you.

The plot is, of course, simple and just an excuse for Chan to do some amazing stunts.  There's a lot to like here, including a ridiculous, yet absolutey stunning, fight in a shark tank.  There's so much more, but I'd rather not spoil it.

Just see the film and expect a good time.",1119225600,9,523,4.329896907216495
31307,5,0780622677,"You want action? Then pick this DVD up right now! Jackie Chan never fails to deliver thrills in any of his movies and this one shows what he's known for, crazy stunts all done by himself! No stunt doubles, only Jackie Chan!",1079740800,26,223,4.333333333333333
31308,5,0780622677,"This is an older Jackie Chan movie.  I'm going to make this pretty concise.  Jackie Chan does a great job in some really great and long fight sequences.  In this movie, Jackie plays himself.",1078531200,3,190,4.529411764705882
31309,3,0780622677,"Ok, I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters.  I saw it when it came out on DVD.  Something didn't seem right about the movie.  It seemed choppy.  Then a few months ago, I saw it on TNT, and it seemed to flow better.  Do you want to know why?  Do you?  Well here's why.  When New Line Cinema released this movie, they cut scenes out, cut scenes shorter, and generally chopped off 5-10 minutes of the film.  I HATE it when distribution companies do this.  Then recently on TNT, they ran the whole version of the movie, without edits.  There were scenes that just helped the flow of trhe movie and the underwater fight was noticably longer and more impressive.  While this was never by any means Chan's best movie, the whole version deserves a 4 star rating.  However, because this is a review of the DVD, which is lacking 5-10 minutes, I cannot give it the 4 stars.  If New Line goes back to release a Director's Cut DVD with the whole version and optional Chinese language track, it would get a 4.  But until then, this otherwise great movie gets 3.",1066953600,14,1058,4.299492385786802
31310,4,0780622677,"One of my problems with some of jackies movies is the mediocre production or what I call watchability.  This movie combines what we like best about Jackie, and it was made with high quality production so it is very watchable.
I bought this one before renting it first and was not sorry.  This is one of Jackies best.",1054080000,2,316,4.431034482758621
31311,5,0780622677,"GREAT STUFF! This film and the music is very much like James Bond. This is even better than all the James Bond films combined! Highlights: the ladder fight scene and of course the skateboard chase. this chase is like James Bond's but only it ends better because he jumps off a cliff, grabs a helicopter, the helicopter gets exploded, Jackie lets go, lands into an ice frozen pond and stays under water for about  30/40 seconds. Jackie almost died of hypothermia in this stunt!",1037059200,,476,4.666666666666667
31312,4,0780622677,"""Jackie Chan's First Strike"" is yet another tour-de-force of hilarious near non-stop action comedy featuring Chan's trademarked ultra-choreographed but jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring just plain AWESOME action sequences (including the trademarked end-of-film outtakes).
THE MOVIE:
""First Strike"" follows Jackie's adventures which take him from the snow covered mountains of the Ukraine to the sunny shores of Australia as he becomes entangled in a web of deceit and danger involving a ruthless mobster smuggling nuclear arms, ruthless hitmen and a killer shark!!!
Notable Scenes:
1. The Hotel Fight Scene
2. The Warehouse Fight Scene
3. Hilarious - Jackie stripped down and forced into a funny suit
THE DVD FEATURES:
The DVD is a little sparse on special features, but it does come with a pretty detailed bio (more so than the Rumble in the Bronx DVD) and filmography of Jackie Chan, as well as the movie's director Stanley Tong.  Also included is the film's theatrical trailer.
THE VERDICT:
Action movie/martial arts film fans will love this movie.  The action, as well as the story, are solid.  New fans of Chan will also love this film as its great action sequences.  The DVD features, while a bit sparse compared to more recent DVD releases, are alright.  Overall, whether you rent, borrow or purchase this DVD/movie is worth a watch at least.
Highly Recommended.",1010275200,15,1366,5.1909090909090905
31313,4,0780622677,"Jackie Chan's First Strike a.k.a Police Story 4 First Strike
is one of Jacke best films to date but I do not know why film distributors have cut about 25 minutes from this film. There are a lot more scenes that were ommitted from the international release and a couple of seconds shaved from most of the other scenes, especially the under water and funeral parade. The film itself is still very good and enjoyable and if you are a big fan of Jackie or not this film is still worth buying for the fight and stunt sequences. The story is still in tact but these other scences help explain the story better and the characters are shown in more depth. The original version was in English (mostly) with Chinese and Russian as well as being Subtitled in English and Chinese. If anyone gets a chance to buy the Hong Kong version then do so as you are in for an even better treat.  I have seen both these versions of this film and I recommend both. This film in both version still stands up against the test of time so I advise you go out and buy this film.",1006905600,4,1049,4.245

31317,4,0780622677,"The latest entry in the very distinguished ""Police Story"" series, this is something of a letdown after seeing movies like Supercop and Rumble In the Bronx. Don't get me wrong, Jackie's stunt work is as insane as ever; name one other actor who will snowboard off a cliff, grab onto a helicopter, then fall about 40 feet into freezing water. The plot, however, is rathter overcomplex and slow, and takes too long to get to the real action.  There's only one major fight in the movie, involving Jackie, a group of irate relatives of a murdered man, a large ladder and quite a lot of wooden sticks. It's a great scene, but the only such one in the film. A sequence in a shark tank seems a tad slow, since being underwater doesn't give Jackie an oppourtunity to move really fast and acrobatically, or make his trademark goofy faces. Another scene involving two giant goons in a hotel room and various household objects is somewhat better, but seeing Jackie desperatley run away seems wrong. My final word though? Watch it, but don't make your final judgement on Jackie Chan based on it. Save that for after Police Story, Project A, Supercop, Rumble In the Bronx and Drunken Master II.",970790400,6,1179,4.641148325358851

31321,5,0780622677,"If you think of recent Jackie movies as paradies they're more fun to watch.  This mixes the Pierce Brosdin-type James Bond with the Beatles A Hard Day's Night (or is it Help? ).  He does some globetrotting and some innovative stunts, has embarrassing moments and keeps in touch with Uncle  Billy.
