Its still a good special with the original cast. Enjoyed it, but still wished for more.",1528416000,,246,4.488888888888889

8402632,5,B003QU3Q7U,"I have been a big fan of The Red Green Show ever since I was a child. I may be an American, but I did enjoy the Canadian humor. I enjoyed seeing the cast members as themselves for a little reunion and Steve Smith is the nicest guy I have ever met since I met him in person whenever he is on tour as Red.",1411689600,,303,3.6769230769230767
