8120243,5,B000FBHFIE,Perfect video tape of the King of the Deathmatch tournament.  Quality is old VCR but hey you see perfectly and none of the annoying commentary of the other one.,1465430400,,160,4.517241379310345
8120244,5,B000FBHFIE,"One of the best wrestling performances I've ever seen!
Includes many wrestlers as Cactus Jack, Terry Funk, Letterface, Dan severn and more..

While the matches were short, but they have provided interesting and high-quality hardcore!

I think all the battles were good, and provided a high level of entertainment than ever.

The match between Terry Funk cactus jack, with Bomb Barbed wire was the final battle of the event and the Main Event.

So let this incident Score 5/5",1368144000,,474,4.962025316455696

8120247,3,B000FBHFIE,"This very first edition of the King Of the Deathmatch Tournament is the most Legendary one, although it is far to be the most extreme and spectacular edition of the event (some later edition held in the FMW and in the IWA Mid-South were by far more extreme).

In fact, living in Belgium, I used to hear about this tournament and was very excited and impatient to get my chance to see it one day. Finally, this day arrived but there is some disappointment at the end of this long road :

1)I don't understand why this event is so legendary ;I personnally own some tapes from Atshushi Onita's FMW promotion from 1989-90 that are by far more extreme and bloody than the ones included on this DVD.

2)So matches here are slow paced and are having a very bad timing, the final match in the tournament involving Cactus Jack and Terry Funk is ruined by the ridiculous ring explosion that looks like a firing of bottle rockets on new year's eve and Terry Funk not hearing the count of the ref at the end and making the match ending too soon ! Of course, it is Hardcore, a style that is by far more exhausting than ""regular"" wrestling, but the matches in the tournament are so short !
(On top of everything, look closely, you can even see the wrestlers ""blading"" themselves in most matches)

3)The non tournament matches are all edited and not shown in their entirety (probably to avoid a double DVD release), except for the match between Dan Serven and Tarzan Goto for the NWA World title (a good one)

4)The quality of this re-release on DVD is poor ;the commentators are doing a very poor job (quite frankly, I think their comments are upsetting), however, some of the music pieces that have been added on this re-release are cool and are giving a good pace to the images. But what is funny, is that the event dates from 1995, and you have the impression to watch something from the late 70's or early 80's.

Oh, I don't throw the baby with the water, it's still a good wrestling DVD for a very reasonable price, and will certainly make you spend a good evening, but, since Pro Wrestling fans and scholars use to talk about this event as being ""a Legendary one"", I was personnally expecting something else, not to say ""something more"" !

I'm happy to have it in my collection, but I consider it as an ""historical piece"" rather than a DVD I will watch over and over !",1203206400,,2360,4.411494252873563
8120248,4,B000FBHFIE,"Amendment get The Best of Deathmatch Wrestling, Vol. 3: The Legendary Japanese Tournament, instead of this DVD. You get all the same matches, WITH audio, and another 2 hour DVD for the same price!

I have been waiting to see this DVD for 12 years. I have not seen anyone of the matches, and my expectations are very high.

Tiger Jeet Singh vs Gannosuke- Singh just dominates from start to finish. It was a bit boring because it was so one sided. Brutal choke on the barbwire at the end. Grade C-

Leatherface vs Terry Funk- This match isn't bad and has some potential. Leatherface cuts terry with his chainsaw. They both climb up this 20 ft fence, however neither can do anything since they are both holding on, and they both just climb down. Not the best finish. Grade C+

Cactus Jack vs Terry Gordy- Gordy just dominates this match. Gordy has some wicked shots with a barbwire bat. Gordy press slams Cactus from the top rope onto the floor. Weak finish however one DDT by jack and he gets the pin. Grade B

Hiroshi Ono vs Shoji Nakamaki- Solid thumbtack match. Both guys went into the tacks a lot. Thes guys reminded me of Samoa Joe both in size and the way they hit. Grade B

Ichihara vs Okano- Ichihara tries a suicide dive and you can just see there heads collide. Good solid wrestling match, this one seemed like it wasn't part of the tournament. Grade B-

Iceman vs Kamikaze- This is for a light heavy weight title. I think the Iceman is easily tipping the scales at 300 pounds. Ok match nothing spectacular. Grade C

Terry Funk vs Tiger Jeet Singh- Tiger attacked early and got an advantage. Its great to watch because he is so vicious! He never lets go and just pummels Terry. Tiger used a piece of metal from a chair to stab Funk over and over. He then tosses Funk into a piece of glass. Cactus Jack hits the ring and hits Jeet, and Funk wins. Grade B

Cactus Jack vs Nakamaki- This is a great match! Cactus Jack looks totally deranged! Some amazing moves with a bed of nails, and a bed of barbwire. Solid finish (Finally!) Grade A-

The Headhunters vs Silver King and El Texano- Interesting match, we had Silver King (5'8 195) and El Texano (5'6 185) versus the Headhunters (6'2 450) a piece. The team from Mexico showed some great high flying, but where beaten down by the larger team. Its amazing to see men as large as the headhunters execute such perfect moonsaults. Grade B+

Dan Severn vs Tarzan Goto- A short match. This was for the NWA title, yet Goto went down fairly quick and easy. Grade C

Cactus Jack vs Terry Funk- Great match. It was a brawl for it all. Both of the men bleed and took some huge hits. The ring was supposed to explode and did not. The end of the match was a bit disappointing since Terry just knocked Cactus Jack off a ladder into barbwire yet somehow Cactus gets the pin. Grade A-

Overall it wasn't a bad DVD, however its not the best DVD I have ever seen so it partially did not live up to the hype. Its worth getting because it is an enjoyable DVD. It is true there is no commentary during the matches. In a few of the matches wrestlers really missed some moves, tables didn't break, and there where some glitches. The DVD quality wasn't too bad. A lot of what is said is in Japanese and we don't get a translation. Overall Grade B",1182643200,5,3277,4.334967320261438
8120249,3,B000FBHFIE,"This DVD edition of the 1995 IWA King of the Death Match Tournament is a must-have for die-hard wrestling fans as well as Mick Foley fans.  That said, the video quality is only a little better than your old VHS copy of a copy and the sound may not even be in stereo.  The matches on this set are in many respects below average--many slow-paced outings as well as botched spots make this card drag on in places.  This card represents a historic moment; however, it was the night in which Mick Foley established himself as one of the most acomplished hardcore wrestlers in the world.",1174694400,2,581,4.462264150943396

I think this tournament is legendary and also the match between the two hardcore living legends is a must see. There were a lots of moments I asked myself how can they do this!.

And there were too a lot of great real wrestling matches between the tournament matches. I read the Foley books and I wanted to see this match and was not disappointed!",1167782400,2,462,4.191011235955056

8120252,1,B000FBHFIE,"Somehow this event has gained almost legendary status among wrestling fans, for reasons that I don't know. All of the matches are terrible, with the exception of the Funk/Foley final, which is very entertaining. Except for Funk/Foley, the matches in the King of the Death Match tourney are all about five minutes in length, and are laughable attempts at a death match, and/or hardcore wrestling. The Dan Severn match is passable, but he is a bland personality. The Funk/Foley final is historic (probably because every wrestling fan has seen clips) but the finish is terrible, and you can hear them call spots. But still, they bleed buckets, which should satisfy the hardcore vampires. If you must by this, skip to the Funk/Foley final. Everything else is terrible.",1152662400,4,764,5.0236220472440944
