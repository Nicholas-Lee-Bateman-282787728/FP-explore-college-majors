3918848,3,B002EP8FE2,"Rented this and i must say i am almost as disappointed as the other lone reviewer.  The film looks recent and looks great.  Good cinematography, scenery, and locales and the fight choreography is pretty good.  Sharp, fluid, fights with some nice kicks, stunt-work and some stylized scenes make for fairly exciting action.

However....

The dubbing is really bad and makes the movie seem extra bland and lifeless.  The four dragons or heroes of the film come off as uninteresting.  The story is straight-forward enough for the most part(rebellion and betrayal), but the dubbing i'm sure has dumbed down the characters and situations to the point where you probably won't care.  There is a love sub-plot sort of, but that is short-changed too.  There are a few good fight scenes, but one of them is repeated quite a bit(2 or 3 times), to the point where i had thought it accidentally skipped back to that chapter.  The animated blood is odd too.  Not sure if this was an added thing for the western release or if the Asian filmmakers actually put this in.  And the betrayal part of the plot, as well as the ending of the film, is rather abrupt and leaves you thinking ""that's it?!?""

Worth a rental at best as is.  But honestly, if you never saw this, you wouldn't misss much but a few good fights scenes(a three-way fight in a cavern, a cage fight sequence, and the lengthy fight that repeats mentioned earlier).  2 1/2 rounded up to 3 cause i do think the fights and camera-work/visuals were good.  Who knows, this might be a 4-star film in its original form, but the dubbing drags it to mediocre at best.",1253404800,7,1605,4.598591549295775
3918849,2,B002EP8FE2,"First off amazon says this movie is from 1992 but it's actually a recent movie. To tell you the truth I cant even tell you the plot because it was to nonsensical for me to follow. Now considering this is a Kung Fu movie the plot doesn't really matter if the fight scenes are awesome but unfortunately they are below average and few and far between. It's not so much that the scenes are poorly choreagraghed as the over directing, IE zooming in and out and going fast the slow then fast again. But what was really annoying was the animated blood that would splatter across the screen during fight scenes. So overall avoid this and get one of the other 100s of Kung Fu movies that are far more entertaining.",1252713600,2,705,4.3893129770992365

Its not a ""karate"" movie, its kung fu, which is a completely different style of fighting. Like i said, if u are truly into kung fu, you will not be disappointed.",1345680000,,294,4.462962962962963
8368034,2,B002EP8FE2,"This movie was not very good.  There were a few fight scenes but they were not really that good.  The characters were not well developed and story was very weak.  The best fight scene involved a character that was only seen twice but he was clearly the best fighter in the movie.  I am used to watching the old school Kung Fu  movies so I did not expect a ""Gone With the Wind"" type story line but this one was terrible. When the movie ended, it was unexpected because nothing had been resolved. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1330214400,,538,4.287128712871287
8368035,2,B002EP8FE2,"If the Malaysian film industry sets ""Four Dragons"" here (aka ""Kinta"") as their action standard, then boy o boy do they have a lot to build on. Here's a movie that fundamentally looks good but is so lacking in basic storytelling coherency that it overrides just about any enjoyment that could have been gleaned from it. The fact that it's officially the first martial arts film to come out of the country is moot, since its level of mediocrity is universally disappointing and not in the least bit exotic. What a shame.

The story: in 1881, exiled Chinese workers mine tin in rural Malaysia. When oppression by their greedy overlords reaches deadly levels, four young comrades versed in the martial arts strike back.

Pretty short synopsis, huh? By my standard here, the history of World War II could've also been summed up in two sentences, and yet its generalization wouldn't be as severe as that of this movie, which is an unadulterated mess of sub-plots and story tangents. As the film progresses through its 92-minute runtime, it gets more and more difficult to keep the plot straight in your mind, thanks to its tendency to get sidetracked with romance angles, its lack of cues between flashbacks and the main story, and its knack for springing subplots at you from nowhere (or just introducing 'em out of the blue and then pretending they'd been apparent all along). The filmmakers obviously noticed how seriously convoluted their project was and sought to help out by filling the film with frequent offscreen voiceovers to cue you in on what the characters are doing and why (at least in the English dub), but this only makes things feel even more cluttered.

The movie legitimately tries for dramaticism and characterization, but in the end, the only people you'll be able to clearly identify are the villains, who are forever practicing their evil chuckle. The only other folks you'll take note of are the fight performers, and I'm happy to say that these guys show promise and keep the film from a single star rating. Michael Chin, Shawn Lee, David Bao, Jun Kuan, and Robin Ho are all relative newcomers to cinema, but as legitimate wushu and tai chi champions, they show talent and poise throughout nine fights - especially Michael Chin, whose grounded acrobatics are reminiscent of Yuen Biao. Action choreographer Kar Lok Chin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shinjuku-Incident/dp/B0036TGT7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shinjuku Incident</a>) is a regular candidate at the Hong Kong Film Awards, but I never thought much of his style and this movie doesn't shift my opinion of him: Chin's got to learn that simply having flips and spins in a fight doesn't automatically translate into good choreography, and thus the fights all feel vaguely middle-of-the-road and similar until the last surprisingly good bout in a bamboo cage. Of course, the extremely unrealistic animated blood employed in the brawls can't be ignored for the worse. And here I thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Assassin/dp/B0035V35P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Assassin</a>&nbsp;was cheesy...

Malaysia is an ethnically mixed country, and apparently most of this film's onscreen roles were occupied by actors of its Chinese population. Obviously, this fits the storyline, but because the cast looks like that of any Hong Kong picture, the fact that this is the first Malaysian kung fu movie means disappointingly little. Seeing some native Malay in stronger roles would have been a lot cooler, if you ask me. As it stands, the film doesn't have nearly enough cool parts to it, and therefore rightly deserves its surprisingly low collective rating. If you can get it for under $5 at the bargain bin, give it a watch, but otherwise be content in the fact that you're not missing anything as an experienced action fan.",1328400000,,3894,5.275806451612903
8368036,1,B002EP8FE2,"Spoiler Alert!  This is a waste of time don't even watch it.  The 4 main stars (Dragon, Blaze, Ace, and Tiger) couldn't even hardly fight. I thought when this movie came on that these guys were going to be bad as hell. Not! All this movie kept doing is rewinding back and showing me scenes from earlier on in the movie.  They spent about an hour doing this and the movie is only about an hour and 30 minutes.  Oh and to make it even worse, they didn't start training to be better fighters until like an hour and 8 minutes into the movie. Leaving about 22 minutes to get to the great fighting. And then they still weren't good fighters.  Then They put things in the story line that didn't move the story line along because it had no purpose to the story line.  Such as the bad guys daughter liking one of the 4 main stars.  What was her purpose?  From what I saw all she did was have him repeat the rules for the watcher of the movie. Again with the repetition.  Then what was with Blaze turning trader.  There was no good enough reason behind this part of the story.  What I really hated was how they try to make scenes so dramatic when they were really nothing.  Case in point, when Blaze met with Master Sam about his father's killer and then turned trader.  Where was the drama in that?  This movie was a waste of film.",1291420800,,1322,4.194444444444445
8368037,1,B002EP8FE2,"I could not imagine how bad this movie is until I watched it. It was so painful to finish this movie. The plot is all over the place and extremely hard to follow. The audio is not on the same level all the time. When they were talking Malay, the audio drops to very low level. Just a bad movie overall, please do not waste time or money to buy or even watch this. You won't miss anything.",1272931200,,388,3.9871794871794872
8368038,1,B002EP8FE2,"This film was utter tripe! Wan't sure what was happening in terms of the plot, but I wasn't watching because of the story. I was hoping for some decent martial art sequences, and was denied even that. Overly stylized, weak story, poor fight sequences; it's a movie to be avoided.",1262908800,,279,4.6
8368039,2,B002EP8FE2,"I was highly disappointed with this movie.  It was almost painful to watch, but seeing to it that I bought it ($9.99) and thinking it would be good after reading the back cover, I had to finish it.  The only good thing about the movie was the location/scenery the shots were filmed.  Other than that, the fights were so few and far in between that it made it so painful to just sit there and ""wait for something to happen"".  With all the supposedly talented cast to their own style of martial arts involved, the film never showed their true talent.  Also, what was with the fake blood splatter?  Was this supposed to make the fight scenes interesting?  It made it quite annoying!

Save your money, even if it is just to rent it.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1258502400,,758,4.357142857142857
