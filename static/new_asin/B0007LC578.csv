8048222,4,B0007LC578,"First off, Elise Foss knows what she's doing as an instructor, and offers a good warm-up, workout, and cool-down. It's a good overall intermediate-level workout, which is interesting for the experienced aerobics user, but maybe too much and too confusing for a newbie.

The production is a bit on the cheesy side, to be honest. I'm not overly impressed with the music quality or variety. The home-studio setting for most of the video is a bit boring. You can't have the DVD skip over the introductions and play all the workouts together...you end up having to do each segment separately.

I agree some of the dance moves are a bit silly. But I think more accurately some of them are very 1980's, and dated. Some of the moves seem right out of the movie ""Fame""! The ""aerobics"" segment is really more jazz-type dance than Brazilian. I really DO like the Brazilian dance segments.

Overall, it's a good solid and fun workout, but has some cheesiness to the production that may be distracting to some.",1165536000,3,997,4.718390804597701
8048223,4,B0007LC578,"I bought her ""Viva! Latin Rhythm Workout"" over a year ago & reviewed it there. She used everyday woman which was a bad decision since then you'd look to their stiff movements for guidence.

This only has menu options for English & Spanish languages & the chapters.

She gives the basic intro & then about 6 min of telling you what steps you will do, like mambo, very modified samba, box step, grapevine, etc., explaining the steps & showing the video in slow -mo to demonstrate.

It looks set in someone's large hardwood floor empty living room with huge beautiful floor to celing frech door/windows. There are 4 woman backup (some older) & 1 guy (30s). Yes, the guys shorts are very tight, but I didn't notice til looking for it from the review. He doesn't dance that well, even for a white guy. Some of the woman seem a little stiff as well.

The music seems old style, light latin music, the volume is way too low & sometimes you can barely hear it.

The warm up is set inside with everyone following along & feels great, she gets all the major joints, neck, shoulders, chest, waist, hips, stomach as well as several stretches & movments for the spine.

She only slows down, she never stops, most moves were great, a few I wasn't happy with.

The cool down was also awesome, she really gets into it, gets all the joints, does more then most & feels great just like the warmup did. This is set outside by a large pond or lake.

Her enthusiasm & aking for many WOOPS WOOS in excitement help a little though they do it a little too much. I had a good time keeping up, the steps were easy enough to get by the 2nd or 3rd viewing at worst case.

She teaches well, my only gripe is the music.

You can see a trailer at collagevideo com along with her older dvd.",1158364800,2,1758,4.3
8048224,3,B0007LC578,"This is a cute video. It is fun and it feels like Elise is very into it and keeps you concentrated on what you're doing, but I have to so it's just not aerobic enough. She speeds each move up once you learn it, but even the fastest speeds weren't that great. When my pulse did get up to the fat burning zone it would drop immediately because the exercise slowed down again.

I have to say I was also distracted by the overly expressive guy in super spandex shorts. It's nice to have guys involved so you can talk your boyfriend into working out with you, but why couldn't he wear pants like all the girls did?

Overall the video got three stars because it was interesting to do and maybe someday I'll pull it off my shelf again.",1148515200,,728,4.192857142857143
8048225,4,B0007LC578,Good moves but the music is not great. It doesn't have the latino beat to it. Elise Foss's other video is better.,1129161600,,113,4.181818181818182
8048226,5,B0007LC578,This video has great energy!!  You can help it but feel great after you are done!!,1113868800,,82,4.125
8048227,5,B0007LC578,"I really like the ""tutorial"" up front where Elise shows us the basic dance steps. This is a great workout DVD, it's high energy and fun. I do this workout whenever I feel like my energy level is going down, or when it's too cold outside to go to the gym(excuses excuses!!) I always have a good time dancing to the Brazilian music.",1111449600,11,330,4.253968253968254
