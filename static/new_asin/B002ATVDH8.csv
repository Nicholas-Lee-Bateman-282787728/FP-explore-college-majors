8360392,5,B002ATVDH8,"Season 6 is another great showing of the Two Ronnies. The 8 episode serial this time is a Piggy Malone/Charley Farley detective story.

The duo seems to just keep on getting stronger each season. This DVD is definitely worth adding to your collection but be warned, it is Region 2 so you'll need a region free player to view it.",1460592000,,328,4.466666666666667
