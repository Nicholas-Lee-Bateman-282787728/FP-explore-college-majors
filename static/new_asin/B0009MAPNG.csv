8063061,5,B0009MAPNG,"As a Phillies and Eagles fan since 1950, this DVD is an absolute must.  Seeing the ballplayers from the 70s to the 00s on the field, hearing their comments, seeing Harry Kalas, and all the inside stories about this icon can literally bring tears to your eyes.  Don't waste any time, get this and get it fast.  This ranks very high on my list of memorabilia I have of sports teams from Philly.",1255651200,3,392,4.342465753424658
8063062,5,B0009MAPNG,"It was great to see the history of the Vet, great for the video collection of all Phillie fans.",1229212800,,95,4.052631578947368
8063063,4,B0009MAPNG,"Like the preceding reviewer, I would've liked to have seen more old footage (including more of those wonderfully cheesy promotional commercials from the 70s and early 80s) in this documentary, but there's more than enough here to satisfy most Phillies phollowers.  I just wish that the club had kept up the stadium in the later years before it gained the undeserved reputation of an outmoded dump...",1198627200,,399,5.045454545454546
8063064,4,B0009MAPNG,"Vet Stadium's opening day was on my 10th birthday.

When I was a kid, my next door neighbor was head electrician at the Vet and was in charge of turning the lights on and off there...so needless to say, we went to a lot of Phillies (and Eagles) games for free during the early years of Veterans Stadium.

When I popped this DVD in, I was taken back to childhood days, just watching all the old footage...the wacky promotions they used to have, the Karl Wallenda high-wire footage, KiteMan, the Usher-ettes (my personal fave, as a young boy) and the players like Denny Doyle, Willie Montanez, Dave Cash, Larry Bowa, Greg Luzinski, Mike Schmidt, etc,.....

But it was a little too heavy on the more recent stuff, from the 90's to the end.

There was no footage or story on the famed ""Picnic Area"",...if I'm not mistaken, it was the first of it's kind.

Also, they made it look as if Larry Bowa got the 1st hit in Vet Stadium history...although, I believe the Expos' player ""Boots"" Day got it (top of the 1st inning). Bowa was the 1st Phillie to get a hit that day (bottom of the 1st).

Nor was there any mention of the late, great superfan that went by the name of ""YO-YO"". An older fella whose mid-game dances were a staple of old Phils game and even always got him consistent TV time (so the footage may have existed). YO-YO, to the best of my knowledge, was the only person to formally recieve a ""lifetime"" ticket to Phillies games, just before he died.

Other than that, it was a wonderful, well made trip down Memory Lane.",1127952000,10,1525,4.405693950177936
