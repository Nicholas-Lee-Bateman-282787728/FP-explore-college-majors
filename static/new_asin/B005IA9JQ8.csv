4708692,5,B005IA9JQ8,"I liked the really low price for two seasons of this show!  That was a big seller on this. When this show was on originally I never got to see it but, when it was on syndication I have watched it alot. It is a really funny show and I enjoy it, I have noticed scenes from the dvd's that are not on t.v. I don't know if it was on originally or not.  I would recomend this set, two seasons, one really low price, extended scenes, a really funny show, all of this makes really good selling points!",1360022400,11,493,3.9696969696969697

4708708,1,B005IA9JQ8,"The rating is for the recording of the DVD, not the show.  The third season DVD is like the first season.  The last four episodes did not play, they show up for a couple of minutes and then disappear.  Since I doubt anyone watches the whole DVD when they receive it, its too late to return.  I hope season 4 is better recorded.",1443571200,,327,4.142857142857143

4708727,5,B005IA9JQ8,"This show is still consistently funny after all these years. I remember the gist of most episodes but was still laughing out loud. The non-Blu-Ray ['Regular-Ray' as I prefer to call it], is good enough considering the price is half of Blu-Ray. This version also contains extra footage the Blu-Ray doesn't. Though not a deal-breaker, it is a mild annoyance that the Blu-Ray lacks this feature.",1412899200,2,392,4.954545454545454

4708757,5,B005IA9JQ8,"Got this as a gift for my daughter. I looked at the full set, but was surprised to find out that it was cheaper to go this route. Also if I had any problems with any DVD it would be easier to send back.",1387411200,,202,3.6136363636363638

this one has the bonus scenes so if you like BLOOPERS get this! and plus PRIME SHIPPING come on, 2 day shipping, you can't beat that!

The third season came in the same packaging as the rest, but the fourth season for some reason is different.  It's not a big deal, but for someone OCD like me it's kind of annoying.",1380585600,3,289,4.142857142857143
4708760,5,B005IA9JQ8,I still laugh out loud when I watch these shows...unlike most sitcoms on these days.  The BEST series to watch repeatedly!,1379548800,2,122,4.809523809523809

4708762,5,B005IA9JQ8,"I never watched Friends when it orginally aired, except for a few episodes here and there, so the show was always a bit sketchy because I did not know the plot nor the characters very well. After watching the first few seasons, I am hooked: excellent casting, acting, and writing make this show very funny and heartwarming. I have a emotional connection with all six of the main characters, so I have watched the first four seasons twice, and the second time around was just as entertaining.",1377993600,4,491,4.655172413793103

4708764,5,B005IA9JQ8,This was a great price for 2 seasons. They also look great and work perfectly. I would definitely recommend you buy them this way instead of the whole series.,1377043200,4,158,4.482758620689655

4708766,4,B005IA9JQ8,"One of the best and longest-running sitcoms of the 90s, ""Friends"" arguably had its peak in quality during seasons two through four. This deal where two seasons are being sold as $19.99 (currently) is great; for anyone wanting to buy the complete series, it actually currently costs less to just get all five of these double-season releases than to get the complete series all at once.

Season three's strongest episodes are the ones with a lot of Ross & Rachel drama (""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break,"" The One with the Morning After""), although several other more comedic episodes (""The One with the Football,"" ""The One with the Race Car Bed"") are almost just as good. The show is very entertaining, with excellent acting by the ensemble cast.

Best season three episodes: ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break"" and ""The One with the Morning After""

Season grade: B+
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Season four is about the same level of quality as the already-satisfying season three, with THE best episode of the entire series (""The One with the Embryos""), as well as the famous episode with Ross's wedding flub (""The One with Ross's Wedding""). It's probably the best season of the show yet. However, I don't understand why they had to do an episode that was mainly a clip show (""The One with the Invitation"")...were the show's ratings actually that low? Or maybe they just wanted to remind viewers of how much chemistry Ross & Rachel had.

Best season four episodes: ""The One with the Embryos"" and ""The One with Ross's Wedding""

Only other better deals might be on a used one, but then you never know if the DVDs will be scratched, even if they say they are in good condition.  But for an extra buck or two, I would rather have new.

I remember when the show started in the early 90's, and laughing out loud while I watched it. It is just as funny today. The jokes do not get old. It is very cleverly written.

It got me through high school (and we all know how much that place sucks), college, break ups, marriage, and everything in between.  No matter what I am doing I always know I can turn on an episode of Friends and everything will be all right in the world.  The last two seasons were not as good as the first 8 but they are still good.  I so hope there is a friends reunion show so we can see what happens to everyone.  This is hands down my absolute favorite show ever made.",1481760000,,615,4.213675213675214
