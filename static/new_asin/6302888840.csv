7832332,2,6302888840,"The only reason I want this movie is because it was filmed here in our little town and my son was one of the ""extras"" in it. It has been very difficult to find.  As for the movie - it's funny in spots and grotesque in spots. It's certainly not the worst movie I have ever seen nor was it the best. It's not something that I would ordinarily buy.",1017446400,2,345,3.9285714285714284
7832333,3,6302888840,"This movie has almost everything to keep a cheesy movie fan pleased.  It has zombies, phyllis diller, a psychic, and a big zombie poodle.  Yes, a zombie poodle.  The zombie poodle didn't get as much screen time as it should've but its worth the price for that alone.  The original box had a picture of the poodle on it with the quote ""keep repeating to yourself, it's only a poodle"" and thats why I originally watched this.  The only reason it didn't get a higher review was because the movie drags until the last half.",982108800,6,519,4.421052631578948
7832334,3,6302888840,"This movie has it all! Spooky ghouls, Occult practices, blood splatter, and Phyllis Diller as the diabolical Poopinplatz!  This is a great flick to kick back and watch with friends and just have fun.  I loved the cheese  factor and the surprisingly interesting concept.  I think everyone should  see this at least once; heck.. I even bought it so I could show my friends  the wierdest ""horror"" movie ever made! I have to admit.. there  are several points that actually made me jump in surprise!",949708800,7,494,4.741176470588235
7832335,1,6302888840,"This was terrible! Horrible!!!! With Phylis Diller as a killer, with the name Poopinplatz! I mean, there was no thrill to this! The cover looked semi-interesting, but then I saw this and nearly cried, it was so terrible!  And one character was this woman who was brought in as a supposed DOA. And  then she was alive! I mean, how is this a credible movie?!! When I say  horrible, I mean horrible. I swear to you all now, don't dare pick this up  if you see it at the movie store. You will be in for a pile of trash.",921196800,2,515,4.12
