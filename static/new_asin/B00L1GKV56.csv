6459658,4,B00L1GKV56,"This tells the story of what went on in several villages in Poland, where the local population either turned on the jews who lived among them to collaborate with the Nazis, or were completely indifferent to their sufferings.  Based on an incident in Jedwabne where over 1000 local jews were herded into a barn, and burned alive by the towns people.  Aftermath shows the resentment of townspeople toward 2 brothers who decide to dig into the history of the event, and learn the actual truth.  Good acting, realistic portrayal of the still present anti semitism of the villagers who experienced the event during world war 2, and how being forced to address the atrocity carried out against innocent people turns the village against the brothers for bringing out the facts.  Intense story that will hold your attention once you adapt to the english subtitles.",1416700800,16,856,4.923611111111111

6459664,5,B00L1GKV56,"I am not one to watch foreign movies with subtitles, but this was just amazing. There are many movies of historical events, but this is nothing like that. It's a movie about people in today's world...being drifted to a time before WWII. As a Jewish person who's grandparents went through the war and hearing the stories from them first hard, I personally can't stomach holocaust movies or books...it's just too real for me. I can't just watch a holocaust movie and go to bed. It's so real, and first hand that it hits me really hard. So I never watch holocaust movies. But this movie is very different. And the fact that it's in Poland, and in Polish, makes it very tangible. I highly recommend this movie.",1452902400,5,706,4.566929133858268

6459669,5,B00L1GKV56,"Absolutely brilliant film. Hats off to Wladyslaw Pasikowski. It takes an extremely courageous person in Poland to create a movie that truthfully reflects the dark past of ones own countrys history. Especially when it comes to polish/jewish relationship and German Nazi occupation period in WWII. The actor who plays the older American Kalina brother (not sure if it is Ireneusz Czop or Maciej Stuhr) is masterful and convincing. He clearly does not like Yids (Jews) not in Chicago where he lives now and not anywhere else. However, his younger brothers human decency bordering on obsession overwhelms him and he becomes willing accomplice in his brothers mission to collect remaining Jewish head stones around the town (including Catholic Church grounds) and put them up in his field.  All of this is done under watchful eye and exceptionally hostile attitudes of townships population. In the end this project extracts enormously high price from both brothers but human decency that is not limited by borders, languages or religion triumphs.  Id like to believe that it is people like Kalina brothers who hold the keys to the future of their country. This movie gives viewers hope that not everything is lost Thank you for a wonderful and touching film.",1429574400,9,1253,5.107317073170732

The graves varies in magnitudes from a few dozens people to six and seven thousand people per sight. The German would not be so successful was it not the support of the same communities they concord.

6459677,1,B00L1GKV56,"Lying Slander of Poland

This is as bad as it gets. It is a kind of spinning of Jan Tomasz Gross's ""Neighbors"". According to the one witness Gross quotes, Schmul Wasserstyn, a group of Polish farmers herded 1,000 Jews into a barn and burnt them to death.  Wasserstyn died some time ago, so any
cross examination is impossible. Other witnesses at Jedwabne directly dismiss the Wasserstyn story as myth. Anybody who has seen the poverty
of Polish farmers well knows there is no possibility of a barn of such a size. Next, when the Polish Institute of National Memory started
a forensic excavation of a burned down farm near a small town named Jedwabne, (There was a massacre there by the Nazis, the
victims being shot with identifiable German bullets)Jewish lawyers from America rushed in to stop the
examination claiming it to be a desecration of the dead Jews allegedly burned therein. So facts are not on the side of Gross or of
this movie. There are more Polish Catholics recognized among jew rescuers at Yad Vashem than persons from any other group or nation.
But who cares about truth and reality? Not Gross and not Stuhr.",1424995200,9,1126,4.710659898477157

6459679,4,B00L1GKV56,"""Aftermath"" (2012 release from Poland: 2014 DVD release in the US; 107 min.) brings the fictional story of the aftermath of WWII in a rural village in Poland. As the movie opens, we see Francis Kalina landing at Warsaw's airport. We later learn that he basically left/fled Poland for the US when General Jaruzelski declared martial law in 1981 and that this is his first time back in 20 years (thus setting the movie in the early '00s). Francis comes to visit his younger brother Jozef who runs a small farm. It's not long before we notice that the villagers seem to despise Jozef. We then learn that Jozef has taken a personal interest in restoring tomb stones of local Jews who were murdered by the Germans in WWII, and Jozef is recreating a cemetery on his farm one by one with the tomb stones he recovers. Meanwhile, in a parallel story, things seem askew with the property title of Jozef's farm. To tell you more about this plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: I saw this movie recently at a film festival (more on that later). I had never heard of the movie, and didn't know anything about it or the plot going in. I was surprised how long it took for the true story lines to emerge. When Jozef, the younger brother, is assaulted in a caf a good 30-40 min. into the movie for no apparent reason, I made the mental note... ""why?"". The story line involving the property titles is developed even later, about an hour into the movie. Frankly, by then I was about to give up on the movie. I decided to hang in there, and yes, the last 30-40 min. redeem the movie to a degree. Perhaps one of the reasons that I had trouble connecting is that I was not all that impressed with the acting performances, I mean, you truly watch them ""act"" when in a film you shouldn't feel as if you are watching ""acting"", you know what I mean? All that aside, the historic background and ulterior intentions of the movie can never be in doubt, and just from that angle, this is something people should watch.

I recently saw ""Aftermath"" at the 2015 Jewish & Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati. The screening was sold out, but more importantly, the organizers have assembled a top-notch quality line-up of movies such as The Green Prince, Dancing in Jaffa, and The Third Half, just to name those. As a movie buff and a support of the Israeli cause, I absolutely love this festival. As to ""Aftermath"", the movie is well-intended but takes forever to establish, so I'm giving it a mixed 3.5 stars: not bad but not great either.",1423699200,5,2608,4.488421052631579

8663089,2,B00L1GKV56,"I did not like the movie at all. It is very sad. Leaves you sad. Also it is anti-Polish. If any polish taxpayer money went into production of this movie next time they need to think twice.
This type of movies cloud the truth about crimes of Germans against Jews during World War 2. During the war Germans killed about 6 million Poles, 90 percent of them unarmed civilians, women, children and old including 2 millions Polish Jews. Most of war criminals who did it were never punished for their crimes. After war they lied that they were cooks, drivers, simple soldiers following orders, nobody was pulling the trigger.
Now they call them mythical Nazi's not Germans for political correctness.
Now movies are made that tell the world that Polish people did it to Jews. There were few episodes where war criminals officers from SS used civilians to murder other civilians by manipulating neighbors against neighbors, but it does not change the fact that German Nazis were organizing this genocide.",1477785600,4,995,4.858823529411764
