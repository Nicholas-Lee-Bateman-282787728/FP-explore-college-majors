8609954,2,B00EVU3SFE,"Disappointing and disingenuous.
Has all the ingredients for a great movie...professional acting...scenery...action sequences, but the script is nullified by one moment in the film. It is when both boys find the crashed plane. Neither bothers to check to see if the pilot is injured or dead. Even the most heartless kids would have checked. The other concern I have is the shooting scenes. A shotgun is used. Those kids would have been easily killed or seriously wounded....yet escape injury every time.
I challenge the Dove Foundation to review their endorsement of this film.",1409702400,,576,5.204301075268817
