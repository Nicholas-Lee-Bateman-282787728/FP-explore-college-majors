The scientists interviewed could not have approved of the deceitfuly-edited snippets of their conversations, selectively quoted, w/ a clearly malicious bias.  It is pitiful, but it is just the typical desperate chauvinism from the increasingly discredited Creationists, that is so clearly intended to misguide the only ones left to listen to them: their own gullible followers.  Isn't it amusing, though, that those who tout their own ""morality"" should so rely so desperately upon deceit!  It is morally abhorrent.  (Note, too, that they universally pledge themselves to support a narcissistic, womanizing liar as their political leader in America - oh, they are SO moral!!!  What integrity!)",1262476800,21,724,5.605504587155964
4510623,3,B004ZQN0L6,"This dvd has some very good photography and gets off to a good start detailing the influences that lead to Darwin writing his controversial book.  The rest of the movie is mostly well known scientist talking about his work and why they think it changed the way scientist view biology and geology. It is a bit confusing and keeps going back and forth between the different scientists.  There is not a strong thread of thought.  Mostly it's scientist giving quick, often vague insights into how he may have missed other possibilities due to influences in his life. This is true but really not that profound. The main debate (creation vs evolution) is considered in the various scientist's opinions, but this movie is not trying to prove much scientifically. To be fair it would take a lot more time to go into the scientific facts than a hour movie allows, but a few more examples would have been nice.
 The main thing I got out of it was a better view of the influences that molded the thinking of Darwin (his personal history).  There is a ton of scientific research that shows he had little real evidence for his theories but this movie only highlights a few area's.  I think in trying to give equal time to both sides of the controversy, the directors ended up with a lot of meaningless content. While it was somewhat interesting and is very good quality photography, I was a bit disappointed in the scope of the movie.",1259971200,8,1421,4.596837944664031

So if you are looking for something educational and suitable for schools, etc. THIS IS NOT IT!!!  This video is clearly meant for those who want to see a documentary that supports their belief that Darwin's ideas are not right because it conflicts with their personal spiritual views.  It ""reviews"" data and arguments in a clear, biased and non-scientific way.  It is very clear that all of the creationists involved started with the assumption Darwin and evolution are wrong, and then proceeded to find evidence that supports this opinion. This is not science, and it has zero value for education. I am disappointed that the Amazon web site had no information available on the biased and unscientific nature of this video, and I will be returning this video and asking for my money back.

Interviews include with some of the top science historians today, including the leading Darwin historian, Janet Browne, now at Harvard. Includes interviews with those on both sides of the origins controversy. The producer bent over backward to be fair, and some feel he bent over too far, but the final product is ideal for classrooms and similar audiences.

It seems to me that Darwin had a personal grudge against God because of the unfortunate death of two of his children and the ongoing killing of animals over animals. Darwin either didn't understand the curse after the fall or to my reckoning his puffed up pride got in the way. Is that not what we see in today's world?",1462924800,,486,4.351648351648351

For example, Darwin was totally wrong about the Galapagos finch beaks, but his mistakes are still hyped to this day as scientific facts by Darwinists. The movie splices reenactments with interviews of experts in a very entertaining and informative way.

And as with all things politicized, trolls post one-star reviews. And in this case, they expose their fears that people might watch the video and learn the truth about Darwin, and their ignorance of the Intelligent Design science.

For example, Darwin's mother belonged to a heretical church that denied all sorts of foundational biblical doctrines, his family was steeped in occult societies, and after flunking out of one college, Darwins wealthy father sent him to get a worthless gentleman's degree, which basically meant that he studied various introductory courses and only had to score an average of 40 to avoid flunking out again. Thus Darwin earned a certificate that said he was ""ordinary"".'

And of course, Darwin's ideas about life were precisely what one would expect from a man who was born more than 200 years ago who wasn't much interested in Biology courses, which were themselves wildly inaccurate, anyway,",1454112000,5,1309,5.223809523809524

Did his bias effect his interpretation of the Galapagos for good or bad?  Would Darwin still believe his theory if he knew the complexity of the molecular biology we know today?  Would he believe it knowing the huge lack of the predicted millions of transitional fossils?  Cambrian explosion with its lack of transitions?

4510646,4,B004ZQN0L6,"This documentary comes across as a very balanced assessment of Darwin's theory in light of modern scientific thought. It has a enough of a balanced distribution of narrative, drama re-enactments, animation, and interviews to make it interesting and informative. It has a balance of scientists and experts, from around the globe (not just the US) from both sides of the creation/evolution debate, and it deals with how Darwin came up with his theory, the implications of that theory, and how it stacks up to modern discoveries. It was nice to see such a balanced treatment of what can be a 'hot' topic. Creationists often disparage Darwin and Evolutionists often worship him and little of use is brought to the discussion - this documentary is different. It's thoughtful, open, of good quality and quite thought-provoking (if one is willing to be intellectually honest). The only criticism I have is that it is too brief. The expert interviews are only snippets, and although more complete interviews are available as extras - even they are only a few minutes, I would like to have seen more.

The video begins with a slow poisonous drip of creationist misinformation, and by 14 minutes into it, creationist poison is so unendurable that I couldn't continue watching. This video is not suitable for teaching about Darwin or about evolution, rather it is creationist propaganda. It intends to subtly re-direct the layperson's view of scientific inquiry, preferably leading the viewer to the conclusion that Creation Ministries propounds -- that Darwin was misguided but such a good story teller that he could influence the world... for a time.  Creation Ministries wants us to believe this:  they want us to believe that scientists now have rejected Darwin and the theory of evolution by natural selection.  This is a lie.

4510652,4,B004ZQN0L6,"My background is chemical eng. I like reading the cradle of civilisation, astronomy, physics, archaeology, palaeontology, biology, anthropology, electronics. I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work. From the lower cast (viruses) - highest (human/ alien) until the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally. Even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it (nuclear energy, particle elementary science). I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs).

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded to multiply/ full fill earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses-human are equipped wth adaptive capabilities to changing / hostile environments. Elvis/ M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend. It's not a simple task to keep exist & even becomes more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2620,5.226190476190476

4510655,5,B004ZQN0L6,"With this video, I learned more about Charles Darwin and his Voyage of Beagel.  It appears he got a lot of his ideas about nature before he reached the Galapagos Islands like in the South American jungles.  The fossils he discovered in South America of extinct megabeasts along with geology of these regions appeared to have contributed to his famous theory. He visited a place that just had an earthquake and he could see how marine fossils could get several hundreds of feet above sea level.  This video was a very good re-actment of this famous voyage and I would recommend it to everyone that loves nature. I believe the Galapagos Islands put the finishing touches of his ideas.

The Theory of Evolution has made the grade as a very sound Scientific concept.  It explains a wide range of phenomenons in nature with the usage of few facts and postulates.  It has passed every test and made predictions that came true.  Does it have gaps? yes, but those gaps are rapidly closing with the new sciences like Genetics, Viology and Microbiology.  Does it keep my family healthy and put affordable food on my table?  The answer is YES.  Why do we need flu shots every year, when we don't have the flu? Why do pests that ravage our crops, become resistant to our pesticides? All these questions are answered by Charles Darwin Theory of Evolution.

At first I thought this was an examination of Darwin's influence on the philosophical world, Then I thought this might be an examination of the Darwin vs. ID people.  But as the commentators became more fanciful and convoluted in their rhetorical back flips, I found myself reaching for Occam's Razor.  Indeed, the extra material rips the face mask off-all of these commentators are Intelligent Design apologists. Throughout the ""documentary"" these commentators ascribe thoughts to Darwin, that I have never heard before; the extra material makes clear that this is just tea leaf reading-the same sort of thinking that they use to interpret the mind-of-god when reading the bible.

The DVD makes a lot of the fact that Darwin collected in the Galapagos but didn't record the islands where the various specimens were obtained.  Nothing was mentioned about how he overcame this deficiency.  More ""errors"" Darwin made were emphasized all the while ""praising"" his genius.  A far better approach to understanding what Darwin did and where he went astray is in the documentary, ""What Darwin Never Knew.""

There are strong personal feelings connected with this issue, as demonstrated by the way the reviews on the DVD are so polarised. However, the DVD presents the issue in a sensitive and fair way that allows you to consider the questions, hopefully without the doors slamming shut. Yes, this issue does strike at our deepest beliefs and commitments and that may be threatening for some people to think about. But we do need to revisit those assumptions that we hold deep within. If they stand the scrutiny then we will be much the stronger. If they do not then we need to know, the sooner the better. This DVD is for thoughtful people. It needs to be watched more than once if you are to appreciate the multitude of insights and connections that are explored. Enjoy.

4510669,1,B004ZQN0L6,"The film,  a product of Creation Ministries, gets some things right, but the overall picture catastrophically wrong. Their scientific approach seem to consist of ignoring facts that conflict with their basic position which dishonestly is only hinted at rather than openly stated. Yes, some geological formations are now known to be the result of sudden events. But does this mean that the whole earth was submerged, all contents, simultaneously? There is no such evidence. There is no debate among scientists as to the age of the earth. It is About 4.5 billion years old. The film accuses Darwin of having a preconceived notions, the very position that the film takes itself. Darwin was influenced by Lyell, but Lyell has been proved correct as to the extreme age of the earth. The film also states that it was religious thinkerswho accepted the mutability of species at the time and scientists who generally denied it. Not true. It is really not worth documenting all the errors in the film, beyond noting that they seem to be deliberate.

It promotes  a balanced, critical review of Darwin's thought process (which may be offensive to an evolutionist, but not to a scientist)!  All the evidence presented is verifiable.

4510671,5,B004ZQN0L6,"Having watched something like this by David Attenborough or was it Andrew Marr? I was not expecting very much, but it made compelling viewing. It is a kind of biography of Darwin that majors on the Beagle. In particular it shows how Darwin was influenced by the uniformitarian geologist Charles Lyell, whose books Darwin read on the Beagle. Lyell's idea was that the earth was shaped by slow-moving forces still in operation today. The DVD views Darwin's voyage from the aspect of both the science of his day and the science of today. Modern geology is more and more seeing catastrophic geological events (e.g. earthquakes which are a part of continental drift). Modern biology finds that finch's beaks on the Galapagos Islands change on an annual basis; and that land and sea iguana's mate, but they are supposed to be different species. The program features interviews with experts in various fields. Modern science is undermining the foundations of scientific dogma, as it should. The DVD must be good as it is rattling the cages of evolutionists who give it 1 star. The special features include about 30 minutes of material.

4510672,1,B004ZQN0L6,"Full disclosure first: I'm not an atheist. In fact, I was brought up in a staunch Catholic family, went to three different Catholic schools, a Catholic high school and got two degrees from a Catholic university. I might not be a particularly religious person, but I'm baptized, confirmed and got married following the Roman rite and can go to mass without feeling out of place or making a fool of myself in front of the congregation. I know my way around a rosary, can still recite both the Old and New Testament books in order by heart and remember not only the dates of all major Catholic celebrations, but also the day of almost every saint in the almanac besides having Saint Francis tattooed on my left arm. I even mourned the death of John Paul II and had a grudging respect for him while he lived, despite not sharing a lot of his opinions regarding politics and the Church's place in our contemporary world. I can only wish someday I'll feel the same about our current pope, but that's beyond the point.
The reason I feel I must share all this information about myself is very simple. In twelve years of formal religious education and a lifetime of living amongst staunch Catholics, the subject of Faith being incompatible with Evolutionary Theory was never brought up to me even once. In fact my high school biology teacher, who taught me about evolution in two different courses, was a Franciscan friar. He actually recommended me reading ""The Blind Watchmaker"" in my senior year to get a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, and when I asked him why he was endorsing a book by a virulent atheist he responded something along the lines of ""the whole thing about God not existing is just Mr. Dawkin's opinion and I respect it, his book is still unbeatable when it comes to explaining evolution to a layperson"". This might sound strange to a lot of people from the US, but the fact is that at least in the rest of the western world, the whole Evolution versus Creationism debate is simply a non issue, since even in the most traditional minded, non-secular Catholic countries, science and religion are taught as separate subjects without any further ado. I actually became aware of this so called polemic thanks to my brother, who is currently finishing his Molecular Biology PhD in the US. I was utterly surprised and ultimately disgusted then, and still am, with the knowledge that utter nonsense such as Creationism and Intelligent Design are still taught as scientific alternatives to Evolutionary Theory in parts of what is supposedly the world's leading country when it comes to science, and to add insult to injury, some groups are even actively lobbying to force the teaching of those disgraceful notions on secular schools, but that's the subject of another review altogether.
Simply put, this film is nothing more than thinly veiled Creationist propaganda, and incredibly dishonest, lazy and clumsy to boot. For starters, the credited producers, Fathom Media is actually a front company established by Creation Ministries in order to convince experts who would likely wouldn't agree to be interviewed if they knew the film was ""overtly Creationist"", as it was admitted by Creation Ministries UK CEO Phil Bell himself. So, ultimately, this movie tries, very unsuccessfully, to be a bait and switch by presenting itself as a respectable Darwin documentary that comes to the conclusion that modern science has proved him wrong, particularly when it comes to the length of time for geologic and biologic processes. The makers of this disastrous so called documentary never consider, as almost every scientist, religious or not does nowadays, that the universe began with the Big Bang billions of years ago and choose instead a literal interpretation of Genesis as a sensible explanation for the origin of life and the universe. Now, I'm not going to start exposing how ridiculous and unscientific Creationism (or, for that matter, Intelligent Design) is and how the Theory of Evolution is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science and still stands as the main cornerstone of contemporary Biology since that has been done to death.
The thing that makes me incredibly angry about this movie is that it feeds the stereotype that religious people are nothing more than superstitious, medieval minded zealots, unable to cope with scientific progress. Faith is only incompatible with science when it ignores the scientific method and nurtures intellectual dishonesty, something the so called Creationist ""scientists"" seem to be very familiar with.
I'm giving this movie one star simply because I can't give it even less. If you are a mildly intelligent or educated person, religious or not, my advice is to avoid this movie like the plague. The only real reason I can give for watching this movie may be laughing at the clumsy handling of science and historical fact by the clueless Creationist producers, but that can get old pretty fast too. If you must see it simply out of morbid curiosity, be forewarned: if stupidity offends you, this film is just not for you and will make you very angry regardless of your personal religious beliefs or lack thereof.",1282089600,14,5194,4.943935926773455

4510675,1,B004ZQN0L6,"I watched this movie in an attempt to gain a deeper insight into Darwin's thought processes as he made the most momentous journey of his life.

As it progressed through various amateurish reenactments, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief - the presentation was progressively building a case for discourse on the existence of intelligent design based on supposed flaws in Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Their evidence comprised by a set of unverified statements and a set of massively edited panel of experts who words seemed spliced to suggest that the very foundation of evolution was at question. What is conspicuous in the presentation is remarkable absence of references to any published books or peer-reviewed journals supporting their claims.

I eagerly awaited the end of the movie and found what I expected, this piece of fiction masquerading as a documentary was produced by ""Creation Ministries International"". Google them out and come to your own conclusion on their standing as impartial evaluators of the truth.

The one good thing that I can say about the ""movie"" is that if you are a deeply religious believer and disturbed by arguments calling into question what your faith has ingrained into you, this DVD will help soothe the conflict in your mind. To hell with science, you want to hear the argument from your side of the aisle, people who believe as you do. Show this DVD to everyone you know who suffers from the same problem, that soothing is the one positive I can envision coming of this endeavour.",1273363200,56,1529,4.941634241245136

This DVD made me think deeper about some of these issues... I understood Darwin a little better, in even a sympathetic way because of the difficulties that he faced with losing his daughter, etc.  I also saw more of the ""why"" behind his opinions.  What is amazing is the hostility that has been aimed at this DVD because of the ""gall"" of the creationists in going against the popular stream of evolutionary thinking.  Neither side of this argument was there in the beginning.  It takes faith to believe either one.  I recommend this DVD as well as ""Expelled"" which is entertaining and opens many cans of worms that need to be opened.",1269993600,13,827,4.829787234042553
4510677,5,B004ZQN0L6,"This is a very well-produced and thought-provoking movie that not only ventures into philosophy and theology  as well as the history of evolutionary thought,  it indeed investigates Darwin's thought in light of current knowledge in geology, biology, and biochemistry.  The presentation is balanced with views from both sides of the origins controversy.  Leading historians of science  such as Peter Bowler and Janet Browne are interviewed.  Well-known Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie and the head of research at the Darwin Research Station on the Galapagos Islands, Brian Milstead, are among the others who are sympathetic to evolution.  There is a great deal of spectacular scenery and the reenactments of Darwin's voyage and other aspects of his life add to the quality of the movie.

Using what is currently known in science the film presents some surprises such as beak changes in Darwin's finches that vary from generation to generation depending upon the climate and food supply, a change that has been a great surprise to Darwinists who have taught us that these changes are slow and gradual and happen over long periods of time.  Also unsettling to Darwinian thinking has been the mating of what were thought of as different species of finches.  Even more amazing,  different genera of iguanas have been hybridizing.  As Bryan Milstead points out, this has been very puzzling to biologists.  Indeed he probably makes quite an understatement.

In academia, evolutionary theory is not to be questioned.  This was my experience in university biology classes as I know it has been for others, and this phenomenon was documented  very well in the recent Ben Stein film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.  But this film dares to touch on the sacrosanct:  it questions the idea that mistakes in the genetic code (mutations) can produce novel structures;  that species cannot interbreed (as already mentioned above),  and that geological processes happen according to a uniformitarian view, slow and gradual over eons of time.  These ideas and others are questioned in the light of modern scientific discoveries.

This film would be very thought- provoking for students studying biology, biochemistry, and geology both in high school and in college because it would challenge what they normally hear on TV science programs and in movies as well as what they read in their textbooks.  Those interviewed on the film agree that scientific facts are viewed through the colored glasses of culture as well as one's scientific and philosophical bent.  How often do we hear that the scientific data demand  this conclusion or that, as though preconceived notions and worldview had no influence in how the data is interpreted?

I would also recommend the supplementary material on the DVD which is also very thought-provoking.

I can understand the disdain that Darwinists have for this presentation.  But some of the comments that put Darwin in rather a poor light and that bring evolutionary theory into question come from those who are sympathetic to evolution in the movie.  I can see that some comments might be very disturbing such as the admission by Dr. Matti Leisola that he once was an evolutionist, but since becoming a biochemist has found very little support for evolution.

Surely those that will not permit evolution to be questioned cannot maintain that evolution is a science because everything in science should be open to question.  There is much in this movie that questions the dogmatic claims made by evolutionists.",1268524800,19,3532,5.187279151943463
4510678,1,B004ZQN0L6,"This video was fascinating, well made, but disturbing; I give it one star because I abhor propaganda. After watching this, I found it was a product of the ""Creation Ministries"". This documentary, among other distortions, cast aspersions on things like geologic time, which there is ample and overwhelming evidence. Just because there are a few events like an ice-age era breech of an ice dam that can carve out a canyon in a number of hours, or that earthquakes can push up mountains by a few centimeters does this  question the overall slow pace of geologic change (continents drift by centimeters per year, but continents are separated by thousands of kilometers). If you look at their website, they try to claim that the formation of coal could happen within the time-frame of genesis. The makers of this video apparently believe in a literal interpretation of the bible and genesis. It seems to me that many of the interviewed scientist were quoted out of context.

Some scientists, like Matti Leisola, make some rather bold claims that are unsubstantiated in this documentary, and are left unexplained and undefended. Mutated organisms don't just die in the lab as Leisola suggests (though I may be missing his scope/context). If you spray a bunch of mosquitoes with DDT, some of them will live. If you breed successive generations from the resistant ones, the mosquitoes won't notice the DDT. If you DNA sequence them, you will see genetic differences, mutations; adaptations that help them survive their environment. The rate of genetic mutation is something that can be measured and quantified in the lab.
