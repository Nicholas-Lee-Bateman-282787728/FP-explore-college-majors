2654676,5,B000ICLRFM,"The wedding special is beautifully done. Beth's tropical-themed wedding is set on the beautiful Big Island of Hawai'i. For anyone planning a wedding, the show is filled with many unique wedding tips and ideas.
Primarily, the show captured the marriage of one of Hawaii's beloved couples. While known world-wide and celebrities in their field, they remain friends and guides to Hawaii's homeless and poor.
The program invites you into the private, behind the scenes planning and wedding events, before, during and after. Like all weddings, there are blips and bumps. On this wedding day, there is great sorrow when news arrived of the tragic death of Dog's daughter.
The Chapman family's strength, love, and commitment to their faith and to each other is an inspiration to all.
The production falls into the classes of wedding planning, biography, entertainment, bounty hunting, exotic scenery and travel, and most of all: inspirational.",1197331200,2,936,5.2885906040268456

2654678,5,B000ICLRFM,"Beth and Dog were married on the big island of Hawaii on May 20, 2006.  In the few days leading up to the wedding, Dog and the posse go on a bounty hunt.  They catch the fugitive as the wedding rehearsal is getting underway.  The wedding preparations are shown as well too.

On the morning of the wedding, Dog learns that his daughter, Barbara, has been killed in an accident in AK the night before.  He is definitely sad but he and Beth decide to get married in spite of Barbara's death.  The ceremony is absolutely beautiful.",1186617600,,527,4.381443298969073
2654679,5,B000ICLRFM,"While I've never met them, over the last few years I've come to  absolutely love and respect Dog, Beth, Leland, Tim, Duane Lee and the Chapman family -- and you will too. They're really making a difference in people's lives -- what an amazing gift they all are. Truly. After watching this special, you'll have a new respect for the Chapmans. The love this family stands for is, in a word, beautiful.",1171411200,9,399,4.541666666666667
2654680,5,B000ICLRFM,"I laughed and cried while watching this DVD! The events leading up to the moment Dog & Beth get married, the things they have to go through to get to the alter. Having family by this is very important and when one of Dog's Daughters is sadly killed it shows how strong that family is. It shows how the pull together to continue on with the Wedding. Though it had its sad moments it reminds me of family unity. If you like Dog, the bounty hunter then this is a must have to you collection.",1169942400,8,488,4.147368421052631

8144876,5,B000ICLRFM,"Well for me, I loved how much Beth and Dog show there love for one another. But what really stood out is the biggest decision to go through with the wedding. I believe not everyone would have been able to make that same decision. I do love the commit that Dog made when he said "" there is a time and place to mourn. But today we share our love with one another."" That statement is so true in every day situation.",1516924800,,412,4.036585365853658
