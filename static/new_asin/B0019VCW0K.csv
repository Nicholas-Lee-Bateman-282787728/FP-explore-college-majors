3444048,4,B0019VCW0K,"I love this series so much. I needed to get that out first.

With my reviews for the first ""Gunbuster"" (Top o Nerae!) box set and then the DVD's for ""Gunbuster 2' (Top o Nerae! 2 aka Diebuster), when I first heard about the film projects, which literally are abridged versions of the OAV series, at first I was a bit skeptical because there is so much storyline and character development, to try and make a movies out of these series, something has to suffer right?

Well, part of the exciting experiences of being a ""Gunbuster"" fan was the realization that the original voice actors were going to re-record their lines, there would be new sound effects and a 5.1 digital audio track.

As for ""Gunbuster 2', the film would feature new footage.

While my original reviews go into more detail on the films, I'll give my impressions of each film.

For ""Top o Nerae"" (Aim for the Top Gunbuster) or ""Gunbuster"" was the directorial debut of acclaimed director Hideaki Anno, Gunbuster is a legendary anime fan favorite that casts pretty girls and giant robots into a moving epic of insterstellar naval war.

2015: Earth's first faster-than-light ship, the Luxion, is lost, attacked by unidentified space monsters in the Perseus Arm. Six years later, Noriko Takaya, daughter of the Luxion's commander, enters the Okinawa girls' Space Pilot High School, vowing to be a pilot and follow her father's trail to the stars. But is she prepared for the intense training to become a member of the elite Top Squadron? Noriko's fight has just begun-and the fate of all humanity depends on her meeting the challenge!

The film features parts of the six OAV's spliced together in one film. You lose a lot of the character development and the challenges that made the OAV really special. So, the things that you may have enjoyed from OAV episodes 1-3 which feature the struggles and challenges Noriko had to overcome, these are the segments that are cut the most and only a few parts are featured in the film.

But despite the cuts, the film manages to take the essential parts from the series and in all sense and purpose, the main focus and storyline of Takaya Noriko become a beginner and then training to become a talented pilot is featured.

And again, it's understandable because it is a film and the cuts were necessary, otherwise if we didn't want to watch it with the cuts, you can always forego film and focus on the OAV series.

If anything, the fourth and the fifth final OAV from ""Gunbuster"" is probably the only part from the series that doesn't receive that many cuts or any cuts at all.

As mentioned before, with a new digital 5.1 track, that would mean that the film would have to be recreated audio-wise. Bringing back the original actors for voice work and adding more special effects.

The audio is indeed clearer and truthfully, I did not notice much of a difference between Hidaka Noriko's voice work of the main character Noriko but those who have seen the film have said her voicework is much more polished.

So, overall staying with what Bandai Visual/Honneamise are known best for, it's providing a high quality video and audio encoding on the DVD.  And by saying that, as a Bandai Visual release, there is no English dub.  So, if you are really hoping the new audio would bring possibly an English dub release, you won't find it in this box set.

Unfortunately, the special features are just text bios and unfortunately, there are no video interviews or anything. (note: An announcement was made that the Japanese Blu-ray edition will feature interviews and more special features, let's hope the film receives the same treatment if there is a Blu-ray release in the US.)

As for ""Top o Nerae 2 - Diebuster"" (or Gunbuster 2),the original ""Gunbuster"" OAV series had Anno Hideaki directing, the new series would feature ""FLCL's"" Tsurumaki Kazuya as the original planner and director, Enokido Yoji writing the screenplay and character designs by Sadamoto Yoshiyuki. So, that alone had people guessing how three of the people behind ""FLCL"" would do in creating ""Gunbuster 2' would definitely be interesting.

For ""Gunbuster 2', we are introduced to Nono and Lal'C. Lal'C is part of the group know as the ""topless"" who are Gunbuster pilots and members of the Anti-Space Monster Interception Squad of the Fraternity. For Nono, she wants to be like the historic pilot known as Nono-Riri. And her first meeting with a ""topless"" has made her want to become a Gunbuster pilot even more. But what was revealed is that Nono is not your average type of person. She is a robot that happens to have some special abilities. You also start to realize that the space monsters are still there and ruthless than before.

As for the film, similar to ""Gunbuster"", parts of the OAV series are cut to make an abridged film version. Whereas the original was created in 1988 and had to feature a new soundtrack, ""Gunbuster 2' was created in 2004 and featured newer footage and the cuts made weren't too bad.

Where ""Gunbuster"" really took you on an emotional rollercoaster ride, the main focus of ""Gunbuster 2' of an android Nono who wants to be a pilot is there.

There wasn't that much of an emotional ride in ""Gunbuster 2' until later in the series and thus, a lot of that emotional bond between Nono and Lal'c remains in the film.

There are some noticeable changes such as the scene from the OAV series starting out with Nono getting her name (Nono Riri) from Noriko (main character from the original Gunbuster) and also, the film does not feature Nono's amazing attack abilities that she displayed in the first episode, it's not featured in the early part of the film.

Also, instead of focusing on other pilots and how Nono was treated by them, the main focus is on the friendship between Nono and Lal'C.

So, of the two films, ""Gunbuster 2' came out the best mainly because the majority of the story really kicks in during the latter half of the OAV series whereas the original, I felt that each episode was equally important.

Nevertheless, the ending scene from ""Gunbuster 2' and how it ties into the first ""Gunbuster"" was just touching and overall, I enjoyed the film version of ""Gunbuster 2'.

As for video and audio quality, top notch audio and video encoding from Bandai Visual/Honneamise since it's a newer anime series and the colors are quite vibrant. Sound very clear and good use of audio direction coming from the speakers.  And for those looking for an English dub, there is no English audio option for this DVD as well.

Of course, the OAV series featured important special features and featurettes that made me enjoy ""Gunbuster 2' so much more, there are only text bios of the staff featured on the disc. No special features in terms of interviews or featurettes.

What the box set does include are two booklets for both films with some technical jargon definitions, character bios and information on the mecha and spacecraft.

Included are 11 post cards which feature a heroine comparison between Takaya Noriko and Nono, Kazumi and Lal'C, Gunbuster's Top Squadron and Gunbuster 2's Fraternity and more. Also, comparisons for costumes, machine weapons, buster machine, cockpit, space monster, flagship comparisons and much more.

Last but not least, included is a Certification Exam for the hardcore ""Gunbuster"" fans and fans can take the exam online from the Bandai Visual website.

I guess the big question people wonder is if you own the OAV series, would you want the ""Gattaii!! Movie"" box-set?

My feeling on this is that, personally, I would go nuts if I was a ""Gunbuster"" fan and knew that despite the cuts made to the OAV series to make a feature film, not only do you get a film with a new audio track and another film with new footage.

Similar to Mobile Suit Gundam's 08th MS Team ""Miller Report"" anime special, for that you only received several minutes of new footage and some people felt it wasn't worth it.  I felt that extra footage 1 minutes or more minutes, it's still worth owning if you were a big fan and really enjoyed the series.  The same goes with this box set.

And the same goes with this film. There is more than just a few minutes, you get the original cast from the first OAV series (which was created back in 1988) and having them redub the vocals over 15 years later. That's pretty cool! Granted, I wish there were special features featuring those character's return and an interview with them.

But of course, if you truly want to enjoy the series thoroughly, I highly recommend purchasing the OAV series.

And if you own the OAV series for both ""Gunbuster"" and ""Gunbuster 2', this ""GATTAI!! MOVIE"" box set is worth it because it's two ""Gunbuster"" films and it features some new audio or footage

As for the personal experience, I'll be truthful that the enjoyment for both series was watching the original OAV series. And the inclusion of the booklets and special features, especially for ""Gunbuster 2' really enhanced my appreciation for it.

This movie box set was more of a side dish after a wonderful dinner. The question is if you are hungry enough to purchase that side dish.

I have no idea if the Blu-Ray version of this set will be coming out, because if it is, you may want to wait since the Japanese version just announced mentioned interviews included in the special features.

But if it's not going to be released and if you don't own the OAV series yet, I recommend purchasing the OAV series first. The OAV series in its original format are just a blast to watch, do come with some special features especially for ""Gunbuster 2'. And both come with informative booklets that really make you appreciate the OAV series even more.

And if you enjoy and fell in love with both OAV series like I did, then definitely check out this box set!

UPDATE: A Blu-ray version of this box set was announced and a release set for Nov. 2008.  Also, featuring 1080p, lossless video, subtitled and dubbed in multiple languages.",1218758400,5,9959,4.717416378316032
8275340,1,B0019VCW0K,"This is the first time Gunbuster has been released in the west in disk format, the only other way to watch Gunbuster is to spend $100 or more on a single VHS tape that will usually contain a single episode, two if you're lucky. That or watch it illegally on a streaming website. Of the three options, this Blu-Ray is proof that the latter is your best bet. There is absolutely no reason for a ""movie"" cut of Gunbuster or Diebuster to exist in this day and age, where DVDs can cram 5 episodes on a single DVD, and even more on a Blu-Ray. The original uncut version of Gunbuster is only six 20-minute episodes long, same for Diebuster. That compounded with the fact that the individual disks don't have special features, said features saved for a third disk, makes it baffling as to why we can't just get all six episodes on either disk.

Knowing that this OVA is only six episodes long, every second of every episode is important. In order to make the episodes fit into a ""movie"" time slot, HALF of the OVA was omitted. Important characters only get one or two scenes, important relationships spring out of nowhere as opposed to being built up, none of the science or backstories are well-explained besides some bare essentials, and important character arcs are left incomplete. The end result is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it anime movie where someone that has no skill or qualifications is sent to space where her incompetence gets people killed, but she saves the day anyway because her machine is overpowered. This is not the uplifting, triumphant experience it was meant to be.

In conclusion, the only thing that would motivate anyone to purchase this set is the moral obligation to support the creators, who's work has been heavily modified to the point where all of their original intent is completely lost and all emotional attachment is severed. I cannot condone purchasing this product, both as someone that enjoys anime and as someone that enjoys the art of film-making.",1503964800,3,1978,4.763848396501458

8275349,5,B0019VCW0K,"I'm such a big fan of the ""Gunbuster"" and ""Diebuster"" OAV series.  The original 1988 OAV series is among my personal favorites and the newer 2003 series was pretty cool and nicely tied with the first OAV series and both featured cool storylines and a lot of action.

In 2006, GAINAX went to create two film versions, which are more or less a condensed to 2-hour film from the episodes of the OAV series.  And to celebrate the 20th Year Anniversary of ""GUNBUSTER"" in 2008, Bandai Visual/Honneamise released the ""GUNBUSTER vs. DIEBUSTER - Aim for the Top! The GATTAI! MOVIE"" DVD Box set which I reviewed back in August.

But when it was announced that a Blu-ray version of the box set was being released in Japan which would feature interviews, footage from the movie premieres and interviews galore, Gunbuster fans were salivating over this release.

And now it is released in the US and how does it stack up against the original DVD box set?  The only word I can think of, after I watched the Blu-ray Limited Edition box set was ""beautiful"".

First, there is no difference in terms of the storyline of the films from the DVD box set and the Blu-ray box set BUT the quality differences is tremendous.  Also, you get more for your money as the Blu-ray box set comes with special features, while the previous version came with nothing.  But you did get postcards, booklets and a certification exam.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The first thing I noticed when watching ""GUNBUSTER the Movie"" is that for a digitally remastered film, the high-definition version looked clean and the colors are much more vibrant.  I was literally in awe that this film created in the 1980s, looked so beautiful today in Blu-ray.  The video is featured in 1080p High Definition and the majority of the film is in 4:3 but once you get to the final segment of the film (when it goes black and white), the film is presented in 16:9.  But the video just looked phenomenal.

As for audio, you get Dolby TrueHD (5.1 ch surround) and if you thought Bandai Visual didn't skimp on audio on their DVD releases, the same goes with the Blu-ray version.

It also helps that many of the original cast members returned back to re-record their lines and thus GAINAX and rework the audio for modern times.  But all in all, ""GUNBUSTER the Movie"" looks and sounds incredible in this Blu-ray Box Set.

As for ""DIEBUSTER the Movie"", since this film is only five years old, it's a newer, digital film as opposed to the handdrawn original.  But again, the colors are vibrant and everything looks quite beautiful in the Blu-ray release and the video is presented in 16:9 (1080p High Definition) and also the audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD (5.1ch Surround).

Also, I found the clarity of the special features on the bonus disc to be very cool.  I mean, you can see the skin pores and makeup so much clearly on the Blu-ray disc.  The majority of the bonus features are featured in 16:9 (1080i High Definition).  Audio is presented in Linear PCM (2.0ch Stereo).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This is where the Blu-ray blows out the original DVD box set.  The special features include:

  * The GATTAI!!! Movie - Stage Appearance by Cast and Staff.  This is a 31-minute portion where the staff of both films meet with the lucky fans who got to see the movie and the staff.  This was pretty fun to watch as you learn how both staff admire each other especially DIEBUSTER actress Yukari Fukui (Nono) of Noriko Hidaka (Noriko), especially when it came to the Lightning Kick scenes.
  * GUNBUSTER: Interview on Re-recording session - This 26 min. featurette was very cool as the seiyuu had the chance to talk about re-recording their lines or preparing for the role.  It was cool to see the actual footage during the recording of the original ""GUNBUSTER"" film.
  * From DIEBUSTER to THE GATTAI! Movie - This 30 min. featurette featured the DIEBUSTER staff talking about how they decided to make the DIEBUSTER OAV series to the movie and what they hoped to accomplish.  Also, some insight to the characters and how Nono was based off of Yukari Fukui.
  * The GATTAI!! Movie Trailer - A 2-minute trailer of both films
  * WEB MESSAGE CAMPAIGN - This section is only available if you select the Japanese menu on the beginning of the disc.  This allows you to hear A LOT of audio clips, in almost like a radio drama (short audio segments) featuring the characters of the film.

Also, included are the booklets of the two films and a fold-out informative print piece that is like a primer.

Of course, I'm very biased towards the OAV series because there was more time to focus on the character development.  But with the series as a film and having to condense and pretty much eliminating certain episodes, you do miss a lot of the emotional storylines and watching how these heroines got from point A to to point B in becoming talented pilots.

But the overall goal of the film is accomplished by showcasing two cool storylines and fans of the original to the new fans of the anime series can definitely enjoy.  As mentioned in my review for the films on the DVD box set, I saw this as an additional compliment to the OAV series.

But focusing on the Blu-ray Limited Edition of ""The GATTAI!! Movie"", this literally blows away the regular DVD box set.  Not only is the quality and audio much better but for fans that wanted interviews and any footage of the talent from the movie premieres or interviews with the staff, this box set has all that!

For me, just to see the original 80s staff was just remarkable and to hear and see Noriko Hidaka again was just awesome!  So, for me, this is truly an awesome 20th Anniversary box set.  Seeing the past and present on stage together was a sight to behold for fans of GUNBUSTER and DIEBUSTER but to see how lengthy the footage for each featurette was, this box set is pretty awesome!  You definitely feel you get your money's worth.

If you are a GUNBUSTER or DIEBUSTER fan, this limited edition Blu-ray disc box set is worth it!  Highly recommended!",1227052800,35,6017,4.588566073102156
