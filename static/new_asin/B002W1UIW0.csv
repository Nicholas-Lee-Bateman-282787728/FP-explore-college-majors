4004666,4,B002W1UIW0,"I say that because he was prominently seen more times than any other wrestler throughout the 3 disc set!
I do believe there were other great moments we could have seen that should have been on the disc set or at least additional discs should have been added!
This is a sort of great way to reminisce about the year that was & hoping that the Best of Raw 2010 will be even better than 2009!
Great purchase for all wrestling fans!",1282435200,,428,4.2317073170731705
4004667,5,B002W1UIW0,"This is a great WWE set. This was in my mind the best Raw year ever. It was the year of Orton,The year of guest hosts,the year of Dx,and the year of The Legacy. The only complaint is that this was all PG like WWE was since July  2008 and there was no blood. Though there was more comedy. This set was well put together. This was way better than nine hours of Hanah Montana or watching the High School Musical trilogy. Well anything is better than that. This set is Great for a big WWE fan.",1265760000,,489,4.041237113402062

BEST OF 2009

I have been watching Raw since it was first airing back in 1993 and have never stopped since. Many memorable moments have happened and that includes over this past year. There are a lot of moments included in this set from guest hosts, to the shocking, to the comedic. I am sure you can see from other reviews here that there are some good moments on this set and some good matches. Of course keep in mind these are matches from Raw and not pay per views.

DISC 1

1. SHAWN MICHAELS VS JOHN CENA-the first match on the set is between two of my favorites, HBK all time fav and Cena another fav. This was during the time when Shawn had to listen to JBL and was told to soften up Cena for JBL's match at the Royal Rumble. This match between the two while not the classic their match was in 2007 I believe it was is still very good. In fact I enjoy this match a lot not only because of the action but the story involved. The action is back and forth  with each guy inflicting good damage to the other. In the end HBK wins the match with or without JBL's help, you be the judge. 4/5

2.[NO DQ - I-C TITLE] CM PUNK VS WILLIAM REGAL-the second match is between two more of my favorite wrestlers. This one is another good back and forth battle in which Punk avenges a something that happened prior. Regal of course has his girl interfere in the match but that means nothing. Punk becomes the I-C champion in a good no dq match, at least for Raw. 4/5

3. SANTINO MARELLA VS MICKIE JAMES-believe it or not but two more of my all time favorites, Mickie I will always love and of course the comic genius Santino. This match was a special match were Santino had to beat Mickie with one arm tied behind his back. He had to do this in order to enter the Diva battle royal. The crazy idea of this match alone makes it a classic, and he still looses, I love it. 5/5

4. TEN MAN WRESTLEMANIA ALLSTAR SHOWCASE-IN THIS SPECIAL MATCH Ricky Steamboat teamed with John Cena, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk, and Jeff Hardy against Chris Jericho, Kane, Matt Hardy, Edge, and Nig Show. I know some people may disagree with me but I really do enjoy this match. I know it may not be a classic to some but just having The Dragon in there and the talent that was also involved just can't help but like it. With things that are going on lately I find myself enjoying things a lot more, the action in this is great. A lot of good back and forth action with every one getting in good spots but the feel good ending with Steamboat makes this a great moment. As far as matches on Raw go this is a 5 star one simply because it is just fun. 5/5

5. CHRIS JERICHO VS JOHN CENA-I actually think this is another great match from Raw with two of my favorites going at it [I have been saying that a lot]. The action is good with the crowd really getting into this one. The London crowd make this match seem really epic, to bad Edge has to ruin it. Another good choice from the year for the set. 4/5

6. RANDY ORTON VS MVP-the final match of the first disc is another well deserved match to the collection and like the others is a good match. Back and forth action with the Legend killer ending up getting caned by Shane. Another fun match with two of the futures biggest stars, good match. 4/5

DISC 2

1.[US TITLE] MVP VS KOFI KINGSTON-the first match of disc 2 is another wise choice for the DVD as two of the young guns go at it with the US title on the line. Excellent back and forth on this one with Kofi getting that big win. I seem to be enjoying the selections for this set a lot. Both go at it with everything they have delivering for the fans. 4/5

2.[WWE TITLE] RANDY ORTON VS TRIPLE H VSJOHN CENA VS BIG SHOW-this one right here is just another fun match and although not a classic there are some good high spots. Each person has a fair amount of time to shine dishing out punishment. But after a bunch of high spots Randy takes advantage of the situation and RKO's Big Show for the win and the title. 4/5

3.[LAST MAN STANDING WWE TITLE] TRIPLE H VS RANDY ORTON-now this match here is excellent and was worthy of pay per view like it was supposed to be. Both of these guys go at it hard looking like they want to end each other. The action goes from the ring to the floor to all over the place and back. This gets violent at times at least to Raw standards and Randy keeps the title but is not the last man standing. 5/5

4. RANDY ORTON VS EVAN BOURNE, JACK SWAGGER, MARK HENRY-Randy has to face off with Evan first and does a good job against him. The action is good with Evan getting in a few moments, still Orton finishes him. Next up is Jack but he opts to get a count out loss letting Orton move on to the next opponent. His final opponent was the world's strongest man and at first he seemed like he would opt out as well. But he took it to Randy and even beat him his first night back on Raw. 3/5

5. RANDY ORTON VS TED DIBIASE-this match would pit two team members against each other as leader Orton went up against the Million Dollar man's kid. The match is good and for a while it seemed like the student would become the teacher. But Randy proved to be too much for Ted. Still it is a good match that kinda reminded me of the 90's for some reason. 4/5

6. KELLY KELLY VS ALICIA FOX VS GAIL KIM VS BETH PHOENIX-not too much going on here as usual since most of the ""divas"" cannot put on good matches like they do in TNA. Still it is ok I guess since I am a huge Beth Phoenix fan although Gail gets the win, Beth needs to go to TNA.2.5/5

7. CHRIS JERICHO VS MVP-another good match up with two talented guys going at it with a nice pace. Although not a classic it is still a welcome addition to the set with MVP taking one half of the tag champs in Chris Jericho. Good action in this one much like the others with Jericho ending it with a code breaker. 4/5

8.[US TITLE] KOFI KINGSTON VS THE MIZ VS JACK SWAGGER VS CARLITO-this one features four of the younger stars going at it with everything. All four of these guys are great and yes that includes The Miz. All of them deliver high spots and their finishers and give great performances. Still it is Kofi that walks out the victory in this fast paced and short match. 4.5/5

DISC 3

1.[BODY SLAM CONTEST] BIG SHOW VS MARK HENRY-the first match on this set is really just a contest. This one happens to pit two big guys against each other in a body slamming contest. So the action has to be short which it is with Henry coming out on top. 3.5/5

2.[NO HOLDS BARRED] RANDY ORTON VS BATISTA-this match is the homecoming of Batista who wants some revenge on Orton, the man who injured him. The match is pretty good and features John Cena keeping Randy in the match. Batista controls the match and gets the victory over the Legend Killer. A lot of brawling and power moves were used in this match, just the way Batista likes it. 3.5/5

3. DX VS CHRIS JERICHO & BIG SHOW-next up we have the greatest group ever DX taking on Jericho and Big Show. The match is another good choice for the collection with both teams wanting the victory. Show and Jericho control a lot of the match and even almost end it. But after DX takes Show out Jericho is left to fend for himself and feels some sweet chin music. 4/5

4. JOHN CENA VS TRIPLE H-one of the longer matches on the set features Cena taking on the other member of DX Triple H. this is one of Cena's better matches with my favorite part being when he tricks Hunter into going for his leg. Good back and forth action that sees Triple H get the victory. 4/5

5. CHRIS JERICO VS KOFI KINGSTON-another excellent addition to the set with great action from two of the best in the biz as of now. Jericho will go down as one of the best ever and Kofi is an excellent talent who is on his way. The action is great with a ton of high spots from both, but Kofi pulls off the win. 5/5

6. CHAVO GUERRERO VS SANTINO MARELLA-just like anything that involves Santino this is classic for sure. The opening with all the jerseys is great and the match is short but sweet. Santino goes home a winner regardless of how he got it. 5/5

7. DX VS JERI SHOW VS JOHN CENA & UNDERTAKER-excellent match right here with six of the all time best. I could care less what anybody else says I love this match and all the back and forth things between all of them. There is a lot of fast paced action going on in this one with every one getting in on the fight. The ending of this one is great with Cena and Taker taking it, but watch for the tombstone. 5/5

8. CM PUNK VS JOHN CENA-Cena and Punk get after it in this match up just one day after Cena was in a war with DX. This match is also another worthy addition to the set and features one of the best ""attitude adjustments"" to date. A lot of good action in this one with Punk looking like he was going to get the victory. But it was not meant to be with Cena getting the w. 5/5

9. JOHN CENA VS RANDY ORTON-the final match of the set is a classic battle between two familiar foes. Randy and John go at it tooth and nail if I may bring that back for a second. Sure this is not their best match together but it is a good one for this collection. The action in this one like the rest is great with Cena getting the win, great set. 4/5

This has got to be considered a good set even though it could have been so much more. A lot of great moments have happened over the past year and some for some reason did not make this set. Still there is enough here that anyone who is a casual fan should love this set. Any hardcore fans out there may be a bit disappointed but I found it to be entertaining. I hope they do this every year and release previous years as well. Also I hope Smackdown and ECW sets are on the way.",1264896000,13,9713,4.102739726027397

4004670,1,B002W1UIW0,"What is the deal with the fullscreen format? Every piece of 2009 footage was shot in widescreen format. Every 2009 WWE PPV DVD was released in widescreen format. This a huge disappointment. A fullscreen DVD looks terrible on an HDTV. This is both lazy, and unprofessional that WWE is not providing the best possible product to their audience, especially when they are willing to pay for it. I understand the reason to not want to start going crazy with Blu-Ray releases because it doesn't make business sense to do so at this time. But this is unacceptable. I skimmed through Disc 1 and just stopped watching because of how terrible it looks. I watch RAW all year long in 1080i HD, and now I've been downgraded to a punk ass 480i 4:3 format? Simply ridiculous. WWE needs to make this right.

4004671,3,B002W1UIW0,"The content on this DVD is very good, but I can't understand why it isn't presented in widescreen format like their PPV releases, since RAW has been presented in widescreen since before 2009.

Disc 1: 6 matches/7 segments

-1/12/09, Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena: This was during the JBL/HBK angle where Michaels was JBL's servant and thus JBL wanted Shawn to face Cena and soften him up for JBL's match against Cena at the Royal Rumble. Given the good matches these two have had in the past they did well here as Shawn was able to get more out of Cena than most could. John used his strength while Michaels used quickness and even some heelish tactics since he felt he had something to prove in this match. Its not quite as good as their Wrestlemania 23 or their hour long epic on Raw in April of '07, but this is certainly a great main event for Raw that had the crowd on it's feet throughout. It ends when JBL distracts Cena long enough for Michaels to hit Sweet Chin Music and pick up the win. 9/10.

-1/12/09, Legacy Is Born: After a match with Kane, Sim Snuka and Manu come out with Ted DiBiase to get revenge on Randy Orton for Randy's attacks on them. Cody Rhodes who was at ringside joins them in the ring but it was a swerve as Ted, Cody and Randy beat down Snuka and Manu. Decent segment.

-1/19/09, No DQ Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, CM Punk vs. William Regal (Champion): Regal had snuck out victories in the past 2 weeks to hold onto his I.C. title, thus making this stipulation no DQ and the added element of Raw being in Punk's hometown of Chicago helped give it a bigger feel than usual as they cheered big for Punk. Its hard hitting and pretty stiff as both of their unique styles mix very well, both use submission moves well, Punk works on Regal's arm while William targets the neck and head. Punk ends up hitting the GTS and covers to win the I.C. title. 7/10.

-1/19/09, Vince Returns: Mr. McMahon comes out to a big reaction and addresses a couple of issues, first Chris Jericho pleading his case to be rehired after being fired by Raw General Manager Stephanie McMahon, which led to Vince saying he and Steph will run Raw together and Jericho apologized to her and then the fans, Steph tells him she'll see him at the Rumble and to go to the back. Randy Orton's music hits and he demands an apology from Steph for slapping him earlier, he was in full heel mode as he slammed the McMahon family, Vince went to fire him and Orton slapped Vince down then punted him in the head. Great segment.

-2/16/09, A Viper's Venom: As Shane McMahon is about to hit the Coast to Coast on Randy Orton, Legacy comes down and destroys Shane, allowing Randy to hit the punt kick. Steph hits the ring and Orton hits her with a RKO which brings Triple H down to the ring and he literally shakes in rage at what Randy did to his wife. Great segment here.

-3/2/09, Orton Plays the Game: Randy is in the ring with security and Legacy and says due to last weeks attack by Triple H he is pressing charges against him. Trips comes down to the ring and tells Orton he needs to face Trips at Wrestlemania to avenge the moment Triple H turned on him and kicked him out of Evolution in August of '04. He says that moment defines Orton's career and that if he doesn't face him he will never be rid of that moment. Good emotional promo by Trips.

-3/9/09, The Stage is Set: Shawn Michaels makes a promise that he will break the Undertaker's undefeated Wrestlemania streak, then a video plays of Taker's Wrestlemania victims all 16 of them. Taker appears in the ring and they both banter about their accomplishments in wrestling with Taker saying he will rest in peace but Shawn cuts him off saying he will end the streak.

-3/23/09, HBK's Vow: Shawn is in the graveyard saying he will defeat the Undertaker at Wrestlemania. Good promo from Michaels.

-3/23/09, Santino Marella vs. Mickie James: Santino is in the ring and says after Mickie kicked him last week he demanded to face her for a chance to be in the Miss Wrestlemania Battle Royal. He has a hand tied behind his back and its purely for comedic purposes as Mickie ties his other hand behind his back but Santino gets a couple of moves in then goes to the top rope but Beth accidentaly knocks him off the top and Mickie hits a kick and covers to win. 2/10.

-4/6/09, Wrestlemania All Star 10 Man Tag Team Match, Jeff Hardy, CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat & John Cena vs. Chris Jericho, Kane, Matt Hardy, Big Show & Edge: This was more about star power and letting Ricky Steamboat have another chance to shine as it was the usual multi-man tag match with Rey and Matt staring out in fast paced fashion. Ricky gets in some good moves including big chops off the top rope, working on the arm with arm ringers and his trademark arm drags as he takes out all the opposing team before getting a sideslam from Kane, then Jericho and Show work the Dragon over. Once Jeff gets the tag everything breaks down and there's a great spot where Ricky and Rey hits dueling dives and Rey covers Jericho to win. 7/10, for the star power.

-4/20/09, John Cena vs. Chris Jericho: With this being set in London and this being Jericho's last match on Raw due to the draft, the crowd was more pro Chris than Cena, which should be no surprise I guess. Jericho does dominate early on and then they trade punches as the crowd boos and cheers, then Cena gets the advantage and they boo more. There was some great countering by both men as Jericho fought out of the AA and hit a Codebreaker but only for two. As Cena has Jericho set up for a Superplex, Edge comes down and attacks John causing a DQ. 8/10, then after Edge hits the spear and then a con chair to as the show ends.

-4/27/09, Champion vs. Champion Match, Randy Orton (WWE Champion) vs. MVP (United States Champion): Good one here with both trading mat wrestling holds, Orton targets MVP's head and neck while MVP comes back and has a good showing giving the champ a run for his money. After MVP misses a kick and gets sent over the top rope Shane McMahon runs in hits Orton with a Kendo Stick a few times then a big elbow but runs off when Legacy comes down with chairs. 6/10, for the match as it was good but nothing great.

-5/4/09, Santino's Impression: While Santino is backstage talking to Kelly Kelly, Chavo Guerrero comes in and Santino makes fun of his aunt Vickie's weight by making pig noises.

Disc 2: 8 matches/5 segments

-6/1/09, United States Championship Match, MVP (Champion) vs. Kofi Kingston: Prior to this we get a good quick promo where both men say they will walk out as the champion and it was a pretty good athletic contest. MVP targets the arm early on while Kofi uses his different offense to almost beat the champ, MVP works to ground Kofi. The match becomes very fast paced with tons of near falls and Kofi reverses a roll up into one of his own and gets the three count to become the new U.S. champion. 6/10.

-6/15/09, Fatal Four Way Match for the WWE Championship, Randy Orton vs. Big Show vs. John Cena vs. Triple H: After Randy had injured the champ Batista this match was made to determine a new champion as it was all against Orton here as Triple H was returning to action after being punted in the head and Show was dominate to the point Trips and Cena had to work together to take him out. Also Randy and Trips paired off as they fought on the outside, while Show wore down Cena. After a missed Vader Bomb, Trps hits Show with the Pedigree, Cena hits AA's on Trips and Show, Orton shoves John out of the ring hits the RKO on Show and covers to become the new champion. 7/10.

-6/22/09, Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship, Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H: This was during the horrifying Donald Trump angle where he was the owner of Raw and this match was supposed to be the main event of the upcoming Bash PPV and for a TV match this is pretty hard hitting and actually better than their subpar Wrestlemania 25 main event a couple of months before. Trips goes for the pedigree early but gets launched over the top rope and the action goes to the outside and into the crowd, back at ringside Orton focuses the attack on Trips knee even slamming it into the steel steps and the ring post. Great spot where Orton hits the RKO on the annouce table but the table doesn't break, then a back body drop to Randy but it still doesn't break. The fight goes up the entrance ramp, a ladder gets brought out by Trips but Orton gets ahold of it and slams Trips knee and leg into it multiple times. Trips hits the pedigree out of nowhere but neither man can answer the 10 count so its declared a draw and thus Orton keeps his title. 9/10.

-6/22/09, Breakdown: With his limo broken down on the side of the road Vince McMahon yells at and kicks the driver then says he'll make it to the arena in a limo one way or another.

-6/22/09, Trump-tacular Raw: Donald Trump comes out and talks about the changes he's making to Raw including the celebrity guest host concept. Vince comes out and basically demands to have his show back and ends up paying double what Trump bought it for, which ended this terrible angle for good and thank god for that.

-6/29/09, 3 on 1 Gauntlet Match, Randy Orton vs. Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger & Mark Henry: Due to a recent trade Orton was forced to face 3 superstars making their Raw debuts and first up was Evan Bourne who hit the ring and took it to the champ with some great high flying moves and kicks. Randy did ground Bourne some and as Evan went for Air Bourne, Orton hit an RKO off the rope and covers Bourne to win. Out next was Jack Swagger who walked into the ring, hits a takedown then walked right back out getting counted out and says he wanted to leave a lasting impression and shakes Randy's hand. Mark Henry's music hits and he looks like he's gonna leave the ring as well, the ref counts but Henry stops him and he smiles then Randy tries begging off but Mark uses his strength to throw around and hit a World's Strongest Slam then covers Orton to win. 6/10.

-7/6/09, Randy Orton vs. Ted DiBiase: After feeling like he wasn't appreciated Ted challenged Orton to a match that saw some good offense from DiBiase including a huge arm drag but soon after Randy took over hitting the Garvin Stomp on Ted and the DDT of the second rope but only for two. Randy becomes frustrated that he can't keep Ted down and DiBiase comes back hitting a scoop slam for two then he goes for Dream Street but Randy counters into an RKO for the win. 5/10.

-8/10/09, Fatal Four Way #1 Contender's Match, Alicia Fox vs. Kelly Kelly vs. Gail Kim vs. Beth Phoenix: Some good close nearfalls start off the match then Alicia hits a twisting backbreaker on Gail then later Beth does impressive show of strength picking up both Gail and Kelly on her shoulder. Kim hits a dive to Fox on the outside, then Kelly hits a dive onto both Fox and Kim soon after. Gail hits an odd arm stunner on Alicia and covers her to win the title shot. 5/10.

-8/17/09, Guest Host Mayhem: While celebrity guest host Freddie Prinze Jr. is in the ring, some guy in a trenchcoat and hat (ala ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") comes to the ring who turns out to be Santino and he cuts a funny promo basically mocking a lot of Freddie's movies.

-8/17/09, Hell's Kitchen: Triple H was on the search for Shawn Michaels and found him as a fry cook in a kitchen and after a bit of convincing Shawn agreed to come back and join Trips. Then back live at the arena the run into Jillian Hall who starts singing the DX them and gets trashed literally. Santino jumps out still doing his movie impressions and gets a superkick for his troubles.

-8/24/09, Degenerate Chairman: Vince comes down and talks about the guest host for tonight, goes to leave but DX's music hits and they join Vince in the ring. Triple H talks about a few things namely today being Vince's birthday where they get him to admit his age on live TV which is funny stuff. They show a tribute video that starts out nice but of course turns to all the embarrising moments he's suffered at the hands of DX and others over the years. After this they bring a cake down then since they were in Vegas some showgirls came out along with Cirque De Soleil and ""Elvis"", soon after Legacy hits the ring and attacks Triple H but Shawn runs them off with a chair.

-8/31/09, MVP vs. Chris Jericho: After MVP had pinned Jericho in a tag match the previous week we have this decent back and forth contest. MVP held his own against the veteran powering him down with a big clothesline but gets caught on the top rope and Jericho hits a springboard dropkick sending MVP to the outside. After MVP goes for the Playmaker he then reverses the Walls into a roll-up but soon after gets the Codebreaker and Chris covers for 3. 6/10.

-8/31/09, Fatal Four Way Match for the WWE United States Championship, Kofi Kingston (Champion) vs. Jack Swagger vs. Carlito vs. The Miz: Its the standard but good four way match, Kofi hits a nice dive to all three men on the outside, but back from the break Swagger is working over Kingston's leg in a single leg boston crab. Once each guy starts getting in on the action it becomes a series of near falls and finishing moves, with Kofi hitting Trouble in Paradise on Carlito to pick up the win. 6/10.

Disc 3: 9 matches/4 segments

-9/7/09, The Price is..... Raw!!!: Guest host Bob Barker held a segment of Price is Right to open Monday Night Raw, the contestants included Santino, Jillian Hall, I.R.S. and Chris Jericho and much to Chris' dismay he ends up winning. Funny stuff.

-9/7/09, Body Slam Challenge, Big Show vs. Mark Henry: A couple of years before they would have better matches, there was this modestly sluggish contest where you win by slamming your opponent. Both hit some big fists and clotheslines, but it was Henry who ended up hitting a huge bodyslam to win the match. 1/10.

-9/14/09, An Unleashed Return: Batista comes to the ring with his elbow braced up and says he's come back to say good bye to the fans and to thank them for their continued support over the years. Randy Orton's music hits and he runs down Batista saying he should admit he's retiring cause Orton injured him. Batista then removes his brace and clotheslines Randy out of the ring, then says he's going to Smackdown but his last match on Raw will be No Holds Barred against Orton.

-9/14/09, No Holds Barred Match, Batista vs. Randy Orton: Not a very long one here, Randy tried to beat down the Animal but he falls victim to big clotheslines, a spear and then slamming him head first into the announce table. Batista drills Orton head first into the steel steps, Randy tries to retreat up the ramp but Cena comes down and throws him into the ring right into a Batista spinebuster and then the Batista Bomb as the Animal picks up the win. 5/10.

-10/5/09, Jeri-Show vs. DX: These two star studded teams face off and Show focused the attack on Triple H's back with a sideslam and a big bearhug and just keeps hammering the Game before tagging Jericho who puches at Trips then Michaels gets the tag but soon after he gets his back worked over by Jericho in the Walls before he tags Trips who takes it to both guys. Show comes in a hits a nice double suplex, Trips sends him over the top, then he and Shawn send him over the top of the barricade. Jericho tires escaping but special host Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and some of his teammates prevent this, Chris runs back to the ring and eats Sweet Chin Music as DX picks up the win. 4/10.

-10/19/09, John Cena vs. Triple H: In what could be Cena's last match on Raw (due to stipulations in his upcoming Iron Man Match at Bragging Rights vs. Randy Orton) he takes on his Wrestlemania 22 opponent Triple H. They work well together, Trips hits a big clothesline out of the corner but only for two, then is sent hard back first into the corner a few times and after a couple more minutes of getting beat on Cena makes his comeback and locks on the STF but Trips gets to the ropes. Trips hits the pedigree but Cena gets his foot on the ropes before 3, then back from break Trips locks on a sharpshooter, Cean fights out of it gets his second wind and takes it to the Game, goes for the AA but its countered. Trips hits the spinebuster and sets up for another pedigree hits it but only for two, Cena hits the AA but only for two and after countering the AA again Trips hits the pedigree this time for 3 and the win. 8/10.

-10/26/09, Chris Jericho vs. Kofi Kingston: After Kofi's Raw teammate screwed Kofi and Team Raw at Bragging Rights, we have this match that sees Kingston hit some big kicks and high flying moves including a suicide dive to the outside. Kofi is hammering Chris in the corner who comes back with a big running powerbomb and then he takes over working on the neck and head of Kofi. We see the Kingston comeback hitting the Boom Drop, counters the Walls of Jericho, then hits a side russian leg sweep and rolls up Jericho for 2. A Codebreaker later but Kofi gets his foot on the rope, then hits Trouble In Paradise for 3. 7/10.

-11/16/09, Chavo Guerrero vs. Santino Marella: There's some comedy from Santino as he has numerous sports jerseys on that leads to some boos from the crowd before he reveals a Yankees jersey. There's not much to this match, Chavo goes for the frog splash but Santino keeps rolling away, then Hornswoggle interferes allowing Santino to get a roll-up for 3. 2/10.

-11/16/09, A Frenzy Unleashed: Randy Orton starts fighting with Roddy Piper in the ring and goes to punt him but Kofi Kingston runs down and takes it to Randy. They brawl around the ring and into the crowd where a memorable moment takes place with Kofi putting Orton on the table and hitting a huge Boom Drop from above as the crowd roars.

-11/16/09, Triple Threat Tag Team Match, Jeri-Show vs. DX vs. John Cena & The Undertaker: The main factor here was the two Triple Threat title match main events for Survivor Series were in this match, DX/Cena & Jeri-Show/Taker so that added a little spice to this match. Its pretty good as early on Taker and Trips work on Show then Taker hammers the Game in the corner, Shawn gets the tag as he and the Deadman face off before Show hits a spear. The rest is quite good as all of these guys are good workers (yes even Cena did good in this match), Show hits a nice double chokeslam on Cena and Trips, Taker hits a huge clothesline on Show. Trips hits a running knee on Cena, goes for the pedigree, Show interferes then gets Sweet Chin Music and soon after Cena hits the AA on the Game for the win. 8/10, right after Taker hits a Tombstone on Cena as he shows his dominance.

-11/23/09, CM Punk vs. John Cena: Almost 2 years before they would have more classic matches this contest took place, Punk hits some big kicks, Cena goes for the STF but Punk gets out of the ring to avoid it. Punk focuses on the neck and head of John but can't keep him down for three and he counters an AA but can't hit the GTS, then gets sent out of the corner while trying to hit the running bulldog. Cena ends up hitting a huge AA off the top rope for the win. 6/10.

-12/7/09, A Maverick Irishman: Guest Host Dallas Maverick's owner Mark Cuban is in the ring with John Cena and Sheamus as they both talk about how they will win their tables match at TLC with Sheamus saying he will destroy Cena. Sheamus sets a table up in the corner and ends up drilling Cuban through it. Great segment.

-12/14/09, Randy Orton vs. John Cena: The winner of this match would be the Slammy Award winning Superstar of the Year, while not as good as the Iron Man, I Quit or other good matches they had earlier in the year this was good for a TV main event. Since they had faced each other so many times before they countered each other moves including fighting out of the others trademark moves and of course as no shock to anyone Cena manages to pull out the win to win the title of ""Superstar of the Year"". 7/10.

Personally I thought this was a good but not great collection of Raw moments, 21 matches is nothing to dismiss but only a few of them are worth watching more than once. The same goes for the 16 segments, the Kofi/Orton one was cool as was the DX/Vince b-day one, but most of them are worth a watch but no more after that. So I recommend this set for the good, but honestly its fairly average outside of a few key matches.",1322611200,,20415,4.364139020537125

Now unlike how the ""Best Of RAW"" showcased the entire calender year, this only showcases the year long period from October 2009 to September 2010 which just also happened to be SmackDown's 10th season with SmackDown host Todd Grisham & Matt Striker hosting the DVD.

8382760,5,B002W1UIW0,"This format has been long overdue for the WWE--but better late than never.

Even though Smackdown had the better year all around, the 2009 RAW season still had an excellent mix of compelling and original storylines, nostalgia, and a new class of truly talented young stars. I daresay the WWE hasn't seen this much young talent all at once since 1996-98 when guys named Steve Austin, Rocky Maivia, Mankind, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Shamrock, Kane, Edge, and Goldust were just getting started. It will be a few years before we find out if The Miz, Kofi Kingston, CM Punk, Drew McIntyre, Sheamus, Dolph Ziggler, and Jack Swagger can attain anything close to that Hall of Fame class would go on to achieve.

This DVD set will go a long way to helping determine the ultimate verdict. Laid out over three discs are the year's best matches and moments from RAW in broadcast order, and all nicely introduced with 12 monthly highlight segments and a full year recap at the end. Of course, there will always be a focus on matches that didn't make the cut--like DX VS The Hart Legacy and hHh VS Cena (with a surprise appearance from The Million Dollar Man)--but by and large the WWE editors got this one 95% right. 4.5/5 stars.",1292976000,,1215,4.6465116279069765

8382762,4,B002W1UIW0,"2009 was definately a landmark year for RAW on so many levels as we saw the beginning of new concepts (RAW's Celebrity General Manager), returns (Batista...twice, Ricky Steamboat, D-Generation X, Donald Trump), comedic moments (DX's antics) and elevation of various superstars (Sheamus & Kofi Kingston). Along with these came with a series of moments & matches throughout the year that were definately worth watching again (some more than others) & WWE captured most of them here on a DVD yet looking back at the 2009 year of RAW. Now you already have a list of the various moments on this set so I won't repeat that but here's a review of the actual matches on the set.

Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena - At this time, Shawn Michaels was working for J.B.L. due to him losing a relevant amount of money with the downfall of the economy & with J.B.L. having a title match against John Cena, Shawn's job here was to soften him up. Shawn stated that tonight would be his ""WrestleMania"" & we definately saw ""Mr. WrestleMania"" here as he brought a good performance from Cena here with the match going back & forth early with both able to avoid & counter moves like Shawn turning Cena's missed top rope legdrop into the crossface & Cena punting HBK off the rop rope into an attempted Attitude Adjustment. J.B.L. did make his presence known but that didn't take away from a forgotten quality performance here.
Jan. 12

No Disqualification Match: WWE Intercontinental Champion William Regal vs. C.M. Punk - This stipulation was added here after each man got disqualified in their matches for the past two weeks while Punk had the heavy hometown advantage here as they were in his hometown of Chicago. Punk started off with stiff kicks to Regal before he worked over Regal's arm with an armbar & modified version of the Anaconda Vice using the ringropes taking advantage of the No DQ stipulation. Regal's valet, Layla, did get involved while Regal at one point delievered a suplex that landed Punk right on his head with Punk returning the favor delievering a stiff kick right to Regal's head. This was a competitive match with a crowd that was hot from start to finish ending with Punk not only winning the Intercontinental Championship but also becoming a triple crown champion winning all the titles available on RAW in under a year.
Jan. 19

Mickie James vs. Santino Marella - This was around the time that Santino was determined to enter the ""Ms. WrestleMania"" battle royal at WrestleMania 25 and he had one arm tied behind his back here against Mickie. As you would expect from Santino, this was a comedy match that had it's moments with Santino ended up having both of his hands tied.
Mar. 23

John Cena, Rey Mysterio, Jeff Hardy, C.M. Punk, Ricky Steamboat vs. Edge, Big Show, Chris Jericho, Matt Hardy, Kane - This was the WrestleMania All-Star Showcase & really no other way to summerise this match but it was just a fun match from start to finish that had everyone get their moments in with Ricky Steamboat being shown the ultimate respect from the audience & his peers after the match.
Apr. 6

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho - This was held in London right before the Backlash PPV with both men getting mixed crowd reactions. With each man knowing each other so well, they were able to counter each other's trademark moves throughout the match such as Jericho countering the Attitude Adjustment into a other moves like DDT & Codebreaker, Cena catching Jericho's top rope apron dropkick into another Attitude Adjustment attempt, and turning the Walls Of Jericho into a STF. Cena was able to overpower Jericho numerous times but with a suprise appearence in the end, this was one of the better bouts between both men.
Apr. 20

M.V.P. vs. Randy Orton - The RAW in-ring debut for United States Champion M.V.P. against WWE Champion Randy Orton in a rare ""Champion vs. Champion"" match on RAW which was really just an average performance that was more about the attack afterwards than anything else.
Apr. 27

WWE United States Champion M.V.P. vs. Kofi Kingston - Before the match, we get treated to their pre-match face to face interview. It started out with both men trying to feel each other out early leading to a stalemate before picking up the pace overtime. This went back & forth between both men & was very competitive to the point where M.V.P. did such an impact superplex that how he landed on his neck was cringeworthy. A great match that had both men look strong than they did going in.
June 1

WWE Championship Match: John Cena vs. Triple H vs. Randy Orton vs. Big Show - With Batista forfitting the championship due to injury (an injury WWE was aware of yet still had him win the title), this match was made to crown a new champion. Big Show was the standout here as everyone singled him out to be the biggest threat with Orton trying to avoid him at all cost along with Triple H & Cena teaming together to take him out while at one point Show delievered an giant spear to Triple H that definately looked like it hurt. This was your typical fatal four way match where all men interacted with each other at one moment or another & was full of non-stop action.
June 15

Last Man Standing Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Triple H - This was from the ""Donald Trump Is RAW"" commercial free episode of RAW & one week before their match at The Bash PPV, they would go at it here in a Last Man Standing match...the same match that they've had twice before with each man having one victory over the other. They started off in the ring early before it went into the ringside area crowd brawling. Orton was able to hurt HHH's knee & focused on that throughout the bout using the ringpost & later a ladder to heavily damage it while also punishing Triple H with moves like an RKO on the announcetable that didn't break & later telling the referee not to count so he could inflict more punishment. Both men gave a fight with other weapons such as the steel steps, chairs, TV monitors, and a ladder (which HHH accidently nailed a crew member with) while fighting up the ramp to the stage area onto the entranceway itself as both men beat each other to the point where neither man could stand. It was one of the best matches in their series that year.
June 22

Gauntlet Match: Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Mark Henry vs. Randy Orton - This happened the night after The Bash where Orton beat Triple H in a ""3 Stages Of Hell"" match so you saw the effects that match had on Orton right from the moment he walked to the ring as he was set to face the 3 newest members of the RAW roster who were traded from the ECW. Orton had a nice short encounter with Bourne while Jack Swagger left his own first impression towards Orton. The big story out of here was Mark Henry doing a babyface turn & overpowering Orton to get the victory. This was more about establishing the new characters on RAW more than anything else.
June 29

Randy Orton vs. Ted DiBiase - This was the night that ""Million $ Man"" Ted Dibiase Sr. was the General Manager & made this match with Legacy members against each other. Orton looked suprised that Dibiase actually brought the fight to him early on leading to Orton eventually taking control saying ""I didn't want to do this Ted."" This was an average performance here but the biggest story afterwards was how Orton gained respect for Dibiase for the match they did.
July 6

Gail Kim vs. Kelly Kelly vs. Alicia Fox vs. Beth Phoenix - This was a quick match that was face paced & non-stop action with the highlight being Beth showing her strength executing a doublestacked backbreaker.
Aug. 10

M.V.P. vs. Chris Jericho - Chris Jericho came out very aggressive & was able to keep breaking M.V.P.'s momentum throughout the match but past that, this was just an average match.
Aug. 31

WWE United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz vs. Jack Swagger vs. Carlito - This was no different than the previous fatal four way matches on this set in that it was pull of non-stop action with everyone having a spot to standout & look good but the standouts in this match were without a doubt The Miz & Jack Swagger.
Aug. 31

No Holds Barred Match: Batista vs. Randy Orton - Batista was out for no other purpose than to punish Randy Orton as he was completely dominate here & brawling with Orton & outside of the ring to the point where he tried to run away before Cena made sure that Batista got his revenge.
Sept. 14

D-Generation X vs. Chris Jericho & Big Show - One of the early meetings of these two teams. Jeri-Show heavily worked on DX's backs with Big Show bearhugging Triple H while executing a backbreaker on Shawn while Jericho tried to work on getting a submission over Shawn. Jericho & Show continued to work over Shawn throughout the match building up to the hot tag to Triple H but even then Show was still a powerhouse as he was able to overpower DX including executing a dual suplex before it took a combined effort by DX to take show out. This was a very good match & more of a preview to their more famous encounter at the T.L.C. PPV.
Oct. 5

John Cena vs. Triple H - This was right before the Bragging Rights PPV and this was hyped as Cena's possible last appearence on RAW because if he lost, he was going to leave RAW for good. Both men started out slow & built up over time as both men throughout the match attempted their various signature moves & submissions which were countered & kicked out of various times along with Triple H focusing on Cena's back & eventually applied the sharpshooter at one point. This was a good competitive match that went around the 20 minute mark.
Oct. 19

Kofi Kingston vs. Chris Jericho - This was the night after Bragging Rights where Kingston was the one who was defeated in the 7-on-7 tag match after Big Show turned on the team giving the victory to Team SmackDown led by Chris Jericho so Kofi was out to get some revenge here. This was an athletic contest that went back & forth between both men that saw Kofi begin the biggest push of his career at that point. Kofi & Jericho have one one of the most underrated series of matches dating back to their match back in Night Of Champions 2008 and this was no exception.
Oct. 26

Santino Marella vs. Chavo Guerrero - This was from the RAW at Madison Square Garden & was strictly for comedic purposes from the beginning with Santino trying to pick out the right outfit to the crowd approval to the appearence of Hornswoggle.

D-Generation X vs. John Cena & Undertaker vs. Chris Jericho & Big Show - This was a Survivor Series preview as both teams of JeriShow & DX had triple threat matches against the World Champions at the PPV so they met in a triple threat tag here with one member of each team in the ring at the same time. Both teams made constant tags while we briefly saw some past feuds revisited such as Show/Taker, Cena/Triple H, HBK/Jericho, Cena/Show, Cena/HBK and Shawn Michaels in the ring against Undertaker for the first time since WrestleMania 25. This was a fun main event but what happened afterwards is what got everyone's attention more than anything else.

John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - This was the first ever meeting between both men that saw Punk work over Cena's neck while also witnessing a couple of unique reversals & counters like how Punk was able to keep escaping the Attitude Adjustment or how Cena was able to counter the GTS into a STF with Cena having to deliever an impactful Attitude Adjustment from a different position than usual to get a victory. This was a good match for their first time together.

John Cena vs. Randy Orton - This was the finals of the short one night tournament to determine who was the ""Superstar Of The Year."" This was a nice match & an fitting way to end the set just knowing their rivarly this year that saw both men trade momentum & having close nearfalls. They didn't come close to their earlier matches in the year due to the obivious limits on time & stipulations but this was definately a better encounter than some of their other regular matches (Unforgiven 2007 & No Way Out 2008).

In the end, I liked seeing some matches that were quality in their own right that I honestly forgot happened along with some moments on RAW that I still remember to this day. The only things I would have tweeked here is that the match between J.B.L. & Rey Mysterio the week before WrestleMania could have been added since all we got at the PPV was that quick squash & it would have been nice to see the actual home invasion between Triple H & Randy Orton since that was definately a memorable moment from the year. But overall I was satified here so this is definately a collection to add if you got a few bucks.",1283817600,,12701,4.495882097962722
