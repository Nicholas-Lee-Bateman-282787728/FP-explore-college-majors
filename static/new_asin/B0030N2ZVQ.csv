8385977,5,B0030N2ZVQ,"I purchased the entire four disc DVD Psalms Collection directly from the Worship Network about four years ago. I was very satisfied with the product and have viewed it many times over the years. In fact, I gave purchased and gave this collection to several family members two to three years ago for de-stress purposes and as a soft sell to Christianity. I like the relaxing nature imagry along with the soft music, but there is a cut, (song or two on the fourth disc) that clearly does not belong, but I have gotten used to it by now. I simply turn it down until it is over and continue listening/viewing. I attempted to re-purchase the Psalms Collection Volumes 1-4 recently again directly from the Worship Network. They are currently only selling the first volume within the original DVD Case for around $5.00 as of this writing on 11/25/14. I hope that they will soon return to selling the complete set again. Volume One is one of better volumes/DVD's within that collection. As of this date, there is an individual who appears to be trying to sell their collection for around $98.00. I am certain that I spent between $20.00 and $30.00 for the entire fouor volume collection new. I would like to mention that Daystar.com has a very similar product called ""Reflections,"" which actually airs on the Daystar T.V. Channel usually late night. Occasionally, a segment of it will be aired at other times during the day or early evening. I enjoyed watching them on television, but the airing time was a problem with my need to sleep, so I finally purchased all three vloumes directly from Daystar.com. They cost about $20.00 to $25.00 each. Generally speaking, I am not to hip on adding vocals into this type of format, but they seem to have done a good job of it so far, and it has not become a distraction. There may be one to two songs on the ninety minute DVD that has vocals on it. They seem to be well selected and blend in well with the beautiful landscapes from around the world. Daystar uses the King James version of the Bible for their scripture references that pop up during the video. The Worship Network had additional DVD products under such titles as ""Transitions"" Volumes One and Two; ""Cafe Worship"" Volumes One and Two, and ""The Quest""  that were similar to both the Psalms Collection and Reflections, but they are not currently being offered on their website at worship.net. I am not sure why that is. Most were really good. Yep! I got them all and continue to watch them from time to time. Worship.net use to air both the Psalms Collection and others mentioned above, on television just like Daystar currently airs Reflections. I think that Daystar uses it as a filler during non-program times. I have noted that the Worship Network appears to have discontinued the development of new DVD products that are similar to their previously developed products since they have went off the air of regular television programming a few years back. They do have things going on at their website that are worth checking out, i.e. streaming video, downloads, etcetera, but I would really like for them to develop some new products along the lines of the Psalms Collection again. Perhaps someday they will. I hope that this review has been helpful to those who are seeking to purchase this and similar videos/DVD's. I especially like them for the relaxing quality that they can bring into my life at the end of a stressful day or week:)",1416873600,4,3439,4.684297520661157
8385978,4,B0030N2ZVQ,"I bought this mostly for the soft music and the beautiful scenery--I love putting stuff like this on when I need a break from the hectic aspects of my life.  Unfortunately, whoever chose the music doesn't understand ""relaxing""--several of the songs are frenetic and nervous-sounding, and they don't fit the scenery well at all.  Also, whoever chose the text needs to have his or her head examined--why, with this kind of beautiful scenery and soft music, are we getting Bible verses that tell us about how angry God is and how he'll have his vengeance.  It's pretty ridiculous when you think about it.  All in all, discs 1 and 2 are the best, while 3 and 4 make us skip through a few songs.",1333065600,3,690,4.540322580645161
