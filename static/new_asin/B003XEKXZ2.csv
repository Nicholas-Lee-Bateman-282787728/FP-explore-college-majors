This is a three disc set that features some great events from Strikeforce that includes one of the most historic upsets in history.

STRIKEFORCE
HEAVY ARTILLERY

This was the St. Louis event that was held on May 15 2009.

1. ANTWAIN BRITT VS RAFAEL FEIJAO-the first fight of the night sees future [and now former] LHW champion Feijao go against Britt in a fight that last only a round. Most of the round sees these two work each other in the clinch with a few knees and hands connecting. But it is the heavy hands of Feijao that ends this fight as he knocks Britt out.

2. ROGER GRACIE VS KEVIN RANDLEMAN-this fight was one I was really looking forward to when this was live as MMA legend Kevin Randleman would welcome Roger Gracie to Strikeforce. The first round is basically a feeling out process fro most of it as they throw some jabs for most of it heating up as the round goes on. In the second round they come out swinging as Roger lets the world see his hands. Roger eventually got it to the ground and started working for arm triangles but would end up taking Kevin's back. Once that happened there are few people who have survived a Gracie on their back, Randleman was not one as he tapped to a rear naked choke.

3. JACARE SOUZA VS JOE VILLASENOR-the first round of this fight is excellent with Jacare all over Joe. He is all on him standing to eventually get the take down and started pounding on him from the mount. The second round is much of the same with Jacare getting the takedowns and controlling most of the round, but Joe does a bit better this round. The final round is a great back and forth battle as Jacare starts to fatigue as the round goes on yet still gets the take downs. But Joe fires back and fairs best in this round making it very entertaining as Jacare takes the UD.

4. ANDREI ARLOVSKI VS ANTONIO SILVA-this fight would pit two very good strikers against each other. Andrei was coming off two KO losses and Silva was working his way to a legendary fight with The Last Emperor down the road. The first round is great with some excellent boxing between the two with Silva getting the edge there and eventually getting the takedown. The second round sees more great boxing but it there is more to the round than that, good back and forth. The third round is more of the same but with some more work on the cage, Silva takes the UD win here.

5. ALISTAIR OVEREEM VS BRETT ROGERS-the main event of the evening was for the Heavyweight title with Overeem defending against Rogers. What takes place is basically a mauling as he controls Rogers and beats on him for most of the round until he lets loose and gets the TKO victory in the very first round.

We also get one of the prelim fights as a bonus feature [wish we got them all.]

6. LYLE BEERBOHM VS VITOR RIBERIO-the first round is basically a clinch work on the cage round with a little strikes mixed in. Not much in the first round other than clinch work. The second round starts out about the same but things pick up with some excellent submission attempts and defense. The final round showcases some excellent grappling from both guys, really some excellent ground work by both guys. Lyle ends up getting the split D win.

STRIKEFORCE
LOS ANGELES

This was an event held in L.A. on June 16th 2010

1. CONOR HEUN VS KJ NOONS-the first round was great and very close as they both landed some good strikes. The story of the first round was Heun taking Noons's back and having a dominate position for a while, great first round. The second round is just as great with both guys swinging for the fences and also throwing technical strikes, Conor gets the last second take down on Noons. The final round follows the other two in being great, another round of great stand up as they entertain the crowd with a great slugfest. Noons ends up getting the split D but still a great fight.

2. TIM KENNEDY VS TREVOR PRANGLEY-another great fight follows as Austin Texas native Kennedy takes on MMA vet Prangley. This was great fight with both guys wanting the win but it would be Tim that takes this one. After they battle it out on the feet for a while Tim gets Trevor down and works to the mount. It was not long after that we see Tim sink in a rear naked choke and get the victory.

3. MARIUS ZAROMSKIS VS EVANGELISTA SANTOS-we follow those great fights with another excellent scrap. This fight is a pure strike fest with all kinds of big shots landed. I really enjoyed all the kicks that were thrown in this fight but like the last it was a one round fight. Santos takes this one by KO after Marius gets cocky and try's a flying knee to early.

4. ROBBIE LAWLER VS RENATO SOBRAL-this was a huge fight as these two MMA vets were battling to see who would get a title shot in their weight class. Another excellent fight here with a great first round. The boxing on this one is nice and a few sub attempts make it really entertaining. The second round is good with some great shots landed and both guys fighting smart, Lawler even does his usual playing possum. The final round sees both guys still fighting smart but still letting the leather fly landing some good strikes. Sobral gets the UD win in a hard fought battle.

We get another prelim fight as a bonus feature [still wish we would get them all]

5. JEREMY UMPHRIES VS R.J. CLIFFORD-the first round is good with a lot of clinch work as they both try to get it to the ground. It is the second round though were things heat up as Umphries chokes Clifford out.

STRIKEFORCE
FEDOR VS WERDUM

1. JOSH THOMSON VS PAT HEALY-the first fight of the night would pit former lightweight champion Thomson against a dangerous Pat Healy. We start the night off with a great fight and a great first round as both guys get each other down. Backs are taken and submissions are thrown the entire time, a great first round. They keep up the pace in the second round as they go to the ground again. Like the last round submission attempts like crazy, excellent round. The third round is just like the first two as it is spent on the ground but with less than a minute left Josh taps Pat out with a rear naked choke.

2. CRIS CYBORG VS JAN FINNEY-this fight was for the Women's middleweight championship as the best female fighter champ Cyborg defends against Finney. Now if you want to se what domination looks like watch this fight. Cyborg is just that as she destroys Jan. the second round is just more destruction until the ref calls it and Cris wins by TKO.

3. SCOTT SMITH VS CUNG LE-this is a rematch to one of the biggest come from behind, out of nowhere wins ever. In the first fight Le dominated Smith but in the final round Smith landed a hard punch that ended the fight. The first round is intense with Smith rushing Le and landing some hard shots. But towards the end of the round Le starts to land the hard shots including killer ones to Smith's body. Le rocked him in this round and also showcased a really good sprawl. The second round is mostly Le as he dominates most of the stand up landing some killer kicks including a spinning heel kick that sends Smith down and starts the ending. Le wins by way of TKO.

4. FEDOR EMELIANENKO VS FABRICIO WERDUM-this was one of the most historic fights ever because the widely considered greatest ever Fedor would loose to Werdum in a huge upset. When the fight starts Fedor comes out strong swinging and Werdum goes down. But when he goes down Fedor follows and falls into a triangle, he gets out but gets put right back in it. He holds on for a while but he is forced to tap and Werdum officially beats a legend.

Once again we get only one bonus prelim.

5. CHRIS COPE VS RON KESLAR-the first round of this one showcased some great grappling. The round is spent on the ground with Ron controlling with a rear naked choke attempt. Cope showcases some great sub defense in that round and survives it, it looks like the same will happen in the nest round though. But he eventually gets back up and delivers a roundhouse kick that puts him in a north south position on top. Chris pounds on him until the ref calls it.

This is an excellent set for the very low price, it comes with some great special features and all three main card fights. Still I wish the full cards would have been on here, now that Zuffa owns them maybe they will release full DVD's.",1300060800,9,8336,4.365397030342156
8407991,1,B003XEKXZ2,"You only get three events on two disc, each event only has 4 fights on it. I paid $20 for 12 fights. You can buy one UFC dvd for cheaper and still get more fights. What a wast of money. You can catch Strikeforce on Showtime for free anyways. Save your money!!",1288396800,4,259,4.0
8407992,2,B003XEKXZ2,"I was excited when I saw this dvd.  Based on the description I thought it was a best of DVD which would have been great.  Strikeforce has now had enough events to constitute a best of.

The dvd says ""featuring some of the biggest, most brutal fights in history.""  It never tells you that it's just three entire events on dvd.

Very disapointing.",1287014400,8,345,4.412698412698413
8407993,3,B003XEKXZ2,"PROS:
- 3 different events on 2 DVDs. St. Louis ""Heavy Artillery"", Los Angeles Lawler vs Sobral, San Jose Fedor vs Werdum. Having 3 full events is great!
- Nice shiny, clear plastic 2-disc DVD case

CONS:
- Poor DVD artwork. The back cover has a paragraph of fluff that doesn't specify which events are included and the design and pictures are tacky. I've seen kids on deviant art create more tasteful or more exciting artwork. - Since the case is clear plastic, the inside of the sleeves list which discs have which events. Each event is dated incorrectly! They're all listed as 2009 when they all occurred in 2010! Whoever was in charge of the artwork just didn't care apparently and allowed this glaring mistake to hit the shelves.
- Video quality is piss poor. I'm not expecting HD blu-ray quality, but the video is just as smudgy and washed out as a video on the internet! Again, this indicates a rush job or the producers not caring about their product!

In summation, I feel as though I could have just watched these fights on youtube - the quality of the audio and video are actually on that level - except I put it into my DVD player! Even with a PS3 which enhances the DVD, the quality of the discs were very lacking.

I don't know if Showtime wants to be a serious contender in MMA but putting out poor quality DVDs like this isn't going to win over any new fans and as a fan of Strikeforce already, DVDs like this are like a spit in the face.",1287014400,9,1454,4.357933579335794
8407994,5,B003XEKXZ2,"I bought this item to support Strikeforce. Awesome fast shipping by amazon, took about 2 days. Strikeforce broadcast quality was very good, clear picture quality, and good production values. the events themselves were pretty good, with some vets thrown in against new up and comers. I haven't checked out the extras yet, however. Id definitely recommend this product if you haven't seen the events yet.",1286928000,8,402,5.2
