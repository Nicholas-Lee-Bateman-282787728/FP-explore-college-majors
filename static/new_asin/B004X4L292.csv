8446035,5,B004X4L292,"Back in 1999, the yahoo mailing list I belong to for Danny Joe Brown, began planning with Riff West to try to do something for Danny. He had massive bills from his treatment for diabetes, after much background termoil it finally happened. This fine DVD is the results of the one last show Danny would ever be at. Although he was only able to sing on ""Flirtin' With Disaster"", the show was a fitting tribute to the man. Unfortunatly the show is not complete, due to copywrite and ownership rules. Somewhere out there is the full show (over 4 hours of amazing music), and I hope that someday it will se the light of day. It deserves to be out there so people can fully appreciate how many artists in the recording industry stood up for Danny Joe. Get this set you won't be disappointed!!!!",1316995200,2,787,4.43448275862069
