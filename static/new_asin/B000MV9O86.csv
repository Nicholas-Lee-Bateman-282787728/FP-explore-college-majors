2750310,5,B000MV9O86,"""Has he been murdered?"" -- Anne

""Well, that'd be my guess. When people die naturally you seldom find them wrapped up in the back seat of a car."" -- Larry

A light and breezy tone similar to ""Borderline"" makes this Universal ""B"" crime film very enjoyable. ""Bulldog Drummond's"" Heather Angel finally gets a lead role and sparkles as a schoolteacher trying to breathe a little life into her life and falling into cime and romance in the process.

Anne Gladdes (Heather Angel) lets her hair down and takes her glasses off to put some zip into her life away from the classroom. When she jumps into a car to avoid a sleazy pick-up on a park bench, however, she is in for more adventure than she'd had in mind. The car she sort of steals is already stolen, and there's a stiff riding in the back seat. Larry Cameron (John KIng) has reported his car stolen, so the cops are on the prowl and the gangsters want it back even worse.

It's fun and exciting for Anne, who's never had much happen in her life until now. She remains oblivious to the real danger involved until the stranded motorist she picks up discovers the body. Larry is shady in a harmless way and the two have both fun and romance while on the run from the cops and gangsters. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay walks the highwire between crime and humor deftly in this terrific little ""B"".

Constance Collier offers fine support as the plucky Mrs. Breckenbridge, whose legal juice will come in handy near the end. A sweet closing and a cute performance by Heather Angel make this one a delightful find for ""B"" fans.",1228694400,4,1566,4.5

One day, she realizes that she's 25 (!) years old, and fears she'll die a dull ""old maid"". So, throwing caution to the wind, Anne ditches her spectacles, buys some flashy new clothes and sets out on an adventure. Within seconds, Anne gets herself mixed up w/ gangsters, auto-theft, murder, and a police manhunt! On top of all this, romance blooms between Anne and a handsome man in need of a ride. It's unfortunate that Anne and her passenger have no idea what they've been carrying around in the car's back seat! Now, the chase is on. Can Anne and her new beau find happiness before either the cops or the gangsters catch up w/ them?

If you like being on the edge of your seat with constant story shifts and madcap comedy situations like those found in silent films, you'll love this little gem. In fact, it often feels like the Keystone Kops because Al Christie, the man responsible for many silent films was the director. Don't expect great acting, but if you can let yourself go on this roller coaster ride, you'll probably say ""let's do it again"" at the end.",1412985600,2,620,4.544642857142857

2750355,5,B000MV9O86,"Schoolteacher Anne Gladden (Heather Angel) is bespectacled and prim and proper and, oh dear, dowdy. In class one day, Anne is clobbered with an epiphany - that she's 25 and going older every day and hasn't lived life and faces dreary days ahead as a lonesome spinster. So there's Anne Gladden in a tizzy, purchasing a swell dress - and she glams up pretty great! - and reserving the day after as her one day of glorious freedom. Off she goes to start some sh--.

The Pennsylvania police have issued an all points bulletin for a stolen limousine - the model, a Stephens Knight, licence plate #M812124, in case you want to help out. Meanwhile, them goons what ""reappropriated"" the limo are sweatin' buckets because 1) they'd stashed a corpse in the back, and 2) the overcoat they'd covered the corpse with could incriminate their boss, and 3) the car they'd stolen just got stolen from under their noses.

And what compelled our schoolteacher to drive off in the Stephens Knight? It's somethin' to do with that gunsel Lothario on the make, and the car he was guarding was Anne's fastest, most direct way to shake him. So, now, pistol-packing goons after her, the local constabulary after her. In only one day, our belatedly adventurous Anne becomes Public Enemy #1 in the state of Pennsylvania.

1940's Half a Sinner (a.k.a. Everything Happens to Annie) speeds along with its one hour running time. And you're missing out on a good thing if you haven't yet seen it. It's a diverting screwball comedy that hijacks elements of the chase film and the whodunit. Motoring along in her swiped limo Anne obeys the courtesy of the road and picks up a stranded gent (John King) whose car had broken down, and from that moment on the screwball comedy transitions into a screwball romantic comedy. Note that her passenger seems both bemused AND amused that Anne seems to be this crook on the run. Because she's easy on the eyes, he rolls with it, even when he finds the stiff housed in the back.

Heather Angel is simply delightful as the frumpy schooltecher become alluring dizzy dame. In fact, she's so winning here that the question is begged as to why she wasn't featured in more leading roles. Obviously, I'm a fan of Heather Angel's and I wish more people knew about her. Her early film catalogue boasts some of my favorites from the 1930's: Berkeley Square (1933), Orient Express (1934), The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935), and The Last of the Mohicans (1936). And, of course, there were her five appearances as long-suffering love interest Phyllis Clavering in the widely liked Bulldog Drummond series. ""Heather Angel"" is also track #11 on Sonic Youth's outstanding 1998 album ""A Thousand Leaves,"" so take that, ye more publicized actresses. Not so many actresses can inspire songs. Off the top of my head, there's ""Betty Davis' Eyes"" and there's ""Candle in the Wind"" (about Marilyn Monroe) and Toto's ""Rosanna"" (Arquette) and there I go rambling again.

See Anne and her passenger on the lam in that hot car, but also see them make time for civilized interludes at the Chester Country Club (for tea) and at a gas station (also for tea). See them eventually make the acquaintance of the stately (yet fun) Mrs. Jefferson Breckenbridge (Constance Collier). See our couple stay one step ahead until the big climactic scene, in which everyone catches up, including, thankfully, the unexpected, last-minute cavalry. Half a Sinner is based on Dalton Trumbo's short story ""Lady Takes a Chance."" And yet I don't at all feel that watching it constitutes an Un-American Activity.",1403136000,,3563,4.815359477124183

2750359,4,B000MV9O86,"Typical of the 30's-40's treatment of the genre but better done than many, this film has the usual innocent (here, a young woman), breaking the mold of her staid and chaste life, only to wind up as a car thief and possible murder suspect. Of course, along the way, she teams up with the man of her dreams, though she doesn't know that at first. Together, they go on their merry adventure.

The day begins with clothing that is pretty rather than practical and a pleasant time reading on a park bench (Vogue magazine, rather than some practical or educational material), but disintegrates into, well, breaking the law, interactions with thugs, and car chases.  Though at first she regards the events as exciting, by the end of it she is much more inclined to consider consequences.
It is not going to be your most stunning, most action packed, or whatever, but it was absolutely delightful.  The characters were engaging, conversations witty, plot satisfying.  I am a little surprised, in retrospect, that it took me as long as it did to figure out one of the characters, but that made the reveal that much more enjoyable.",1393545600,,823,4.815602836879433

They really should drop kick all this edgy and epic nonselce and bring back all the fun they can in a world gone mad with... what ever it is they call that, but it ain't entertainment!

2750373,5,B000MV9O86,"This is a love story that happens in the idealized United States culture of the 1940's \ 50's.  A nice very young and beautiful alas eminently sensible school teacher is stopped in the hall.  In front of her a rather forlorn matronly older school teacher who at age 40 has drawn up dried up spinster type looks that have clearly exceeded their ""BEST IF USED BY Date!  The older school teacher in her dour tone tells the younger school teacher of earlier times in her life when she too could turn a mans head with her stunning looks.  Her story goes on to real a sad tale of romance lost and never found again.  The older spinster school teach wise with age tells the younger school teacher NOT to hide her physical beauty under tons of sensible clothing that made her look an old frump long before her time.  The old school teacher with unusual passion entreats the younger teacher to shed the stolid drab clothes, buy things that are so young and fresh they catch a mans eye keeping it.

The younger school teacher does just that and becomes an instant good looking knock out to the absolute shock of her live in grandma.  Well turns out our sheltered young school teach ventures out into the world and she is not the worldly sort.  While reading in the park a Masher approaches but he is not just an idle young man with lust in his heart he is also a petty gangster who is not too bright.  The gangster hits on the nice prim but newly sexy school teacher and she puts him in his place literally.  In a hurry to get away from this foul man she inadvertently steals a car but not just any car.  This builds up to the enjoyable romp that is corny when looked at by the jaded eyes of 2013 viewers for whom today's love, sex and dating are far more fast paced and forward.  The characters in the movie are not meant to be taken with complete seriousness as they all have a comedic quality about them which was intentional.  The movie is more a comedic love story with elements of a crime drama added in.

I think Half A Sinner is an entirely great movie played to perfection by its cast.  If Half A Sinner had taken itself seriously as a crime drama or a mystery it would have fallen flat.  Half A Sinner is mostly a love story filled with irony, wit and wisdom about living life, loving life, taking chances and growing old.  The older the top rich pushy lady ended up being my favorite people in the movie she was no bodies fool.  The ending is the exact syrupy ending this story needs and deserves.  I love the and they lived happily ever after endings.  For the few dollars this movie costs it is one of the best movies in my collection.  The sound and picture quality is acceptable for the price paid.",1376611200,3,2703,4.310891089108911

This film is diverted off-track a bit during the first, unnecessary, 5-minutes, but then picks-up and moves at a good pace throughout; staying on story from then-on.

The ditsy, but charming young woman, is quite believable being caught-up unaware in this trouble with gangsters. The gangster boss must retrieve some incriminating evidence, which the woman does not know she has. The young man coming to her aid is clever. Later; an older, wealthy, woman helps her too and is clever and brave in fighting the gangsters. The ditsy, but charming young woman remains unaware throughout the ever-present danger and the gangster's pursuit of her.

This film has some personality and charm. The story keeps moving. The film lacks a love story between the helping man and the ditsy woman; that would have given this movie some depth & substance; however, her being ditsy and unaware, and in constant danger, is what the story is about.",1510531200,,1092,4.860215053763441
