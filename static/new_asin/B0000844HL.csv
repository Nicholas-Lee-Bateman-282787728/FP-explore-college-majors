1826004,3,B0000844HL,"Yes, the quality ranges from fair to awful, but so far this is the only way to find some of this stuff.  All of it looks like it was transferred from VHS tapes (some in EP speed) which were transferred from 16mm prints.  Some digital artifacting too (during the Count Chocula commercial!) and no chapter stops for each commercial, plus the fact that it's a 2-disc set that could have fit on one (they probably wanted to make it look like more).  Some great stuff though, including the 'crying Indian' PSA, hopefully a better compilation of commercials will come out someday!",1049068800,9,574,4.663366336633663

1826006,1,B0000844HL,"I concur with the other reviewer. The sound and picture quality is patheticly bad. The static and hiss is so bad, I can barely make out the dialog in some of these commercials. I have no difficulty believing that this DVD is copied from EP videotapes.
The product description fails to mention that these are also all very, very old commercials (from the 1950's). What makes them ""classic,"" other than the fact that they're very old, is beyond me.",1046476800,5,446,4.658227848101266
1826007,1,B0000844HL,"Save your money and do not buy this dvd. The picure quality is very poor as well as the audio. The dvd was produced by copying the 4 video tapes of Classic Commercials which Madacy Entertainment produced last year. The video tapes were copied in the EP format which gives the worst video quality. The dvd is almost twice as long as the vhs tapes because some extra's have been added, but it is still a very poor product. It would be better to wait to buy a dvd with Classic Commercials until a major production company decides to release one. All you will do is waste your money as I did.",1045612800,12,588,4.258928571428571
1826017,3,B0000844HL,"This 2-DVD set from Madacy features over 3 hours of nonstop classic commercials spanning from the 50's to the 70's.  You'll have lots of fun spotting celebrities and remembering products that have long been discontinued (many for good reason!).

You'll see a young Tippi Hedren in 2 commercials for ""Ivory Soap"" (the second one has her voice overdubbed); Jane Withers as beloved 'Josephine the Plumber' in several ads for ""Comet""; some cool ads for ""Camay Soap"" and a fun in-studio testing for Westinghouse washing-machines.  Fans of BEWITCHED will delight in seeing Elizabeth Montgomery in a tie-in commercial for ""magical Clairol"". SEINFELD's Liz Sheridan pops up in an ad for ""Bounty"" paper towels with Nancy Walker.  And there are several of the classic Mr Whipple-""Don't Squeeze the Charmin"" ads.

There is a lot to enjoy in this set, and fans of classic TV will love it.",1143417600,4,876,5.0137931034482754
1826018,1,B0000844HL,"I was hoping for lots of familiar oldies from the '50s-'70s. Most of what's here are quite obscure. That may be because the company that produced this hodge-podge is Canadian. Anyway, not only is the selection thrown together, the quality of the picture is very poor, especially on the color ads.

This looks like a bad computer video viewed full screen.  The novelty of seeing old ads quickly wears off.  There is NO narration or explanation. Just one ad after another.  I'm usually a sucker for this sort of thing, but the poor quality completely interfered with my enjoyment.  Worth the low price, maybe, to see the Flintstones smoking.  And you sure get a lot of low quality ads!",1119657600,2,533,4.5473684210526315
1826021,3,B0000844HL,"I bought this double DVD set at a local bargain store for only 6 dollars, so I can't complain about the price. But I do think the complaints of other reviewers about the picture and sound quality of this set ARE justified, even if the commercials here are 40-50 years old. They do exist and, in many cases, in almost perfect form. I know--I've seen them.

Way back in the early VHS days, I bought a tape collection of classic commercials, and this DVD set (at least most of it) was taken DIRECTLY from that source. The commercials are the same, in the same order. The quality of that tape was bad 15-20 years ago, and whoever put together this set probably had that tape in their garage or attick for the last 15-20 years, because the quality shows 15-20 years worth of deterioration over the already poor original tape.

On the other hand, the DVD set IS probably worth getting because the price is so cheap and you get so much material. The cheap-o company that put the set out did a pretty good job with the packaging, which is pretty well done, and the menu set up.

It is also worth getting for the Johnny Smoke commercial (as another reviewer said). I remember this commercial from my early childhood, probably when I was 7 or 8 years old. It was such a favorite amongst my ""set"" that we used to tune into the early 70s syndicated version of ""To Tell The Truth"" on channel 5 here in New York at night just to see it (where it was shown as a PSA very frequently), and we had sort of a Johnny Smoke fan club. Talk about unintended consequences! We used to go around snitching our parents cigarettes, fitting them out with paper cowboy hats and making our own ""Johnny Smokes"" out of them. I never did start smoking myself, but I'm sure a few of my old pals did! Johnny Smoke made cigarettes seem so cool!

Also, about the famous botched Westinghouse ad, which exists here (unfortunately) in a VERY poor quality print: it was done live on TV. The refrigerator door was supposed to be electronically activated, so that your housewife could nudge the handle with her elbow (while carrying a heavy pot or bowl) and the door was supposed to open automatically, by itself, so your housewife didn't have to put the bowl or pot down to yank it open. It happened that the plug of the refrigerator had accidently been knocked out of the wall that night by a grip before the commercial went on live, and when the girl (June Graham, pinch hitting for a luckily absent Betty Furness) went to open the door automatically--Voila!, it didn't open! You can imagine her embarrassment.

It happens that this was one of the few nights that our Betty was doing something else, and couldn't make her Westinghouse gig, and poor June was left holding the bag. One can imagine how the paint on the walls would have peeled had the very efficient Betty Furness been the victim of this goof! The whole episode was related in Jeff Kisseloff's excellent history of early television ""The Box"", so it must have been a famous incident at the time. It's hilarious to watch as they move the camera in on Miss Graham in an EXTREMELY tight close up as someone scrambles, unseen, to stick the plug back in. And, yes, by the end of the commercial--Voila!, it does work. Too bad the artifact of it on this disc is so poorly preserved.

I would say, for the time being, and at the low price, by all means buy this set if you're interested in the history of television advertisement. But thse things DO exist in better copies (I know because I have a big collection of them on about a dozen VHS tapes), and hopefully the better quality will become available as time goes by.

Also, if one watches the Game Show Network in the very early morning when they show their old Black & White shows (I've Got a Secret, Password, What's My Line, etc.), when they play the current commercials, they run them over the old ones that are still embedded in the films of the old shows. Once in a while they goof, and a second or two of the old commercial slips through, and they are in PERFECT condition. Maybe we fans of old time commercials can prevail upon GSN to issue a couple of DVDs of commercial culled from these programs, because they would be mint copies of many of the commercials we struggle to see on this set.",1094428800,13,4269,4.430573248407644
1826022,2,B0000844HL,"This two disk set has a lot of commercials, most of which are worn with age and hard to make out. There is only one commercial worth a stand out recommendation. It is a legend of commercial lore from the 1960's and that is on disc number 2 about 50.00 into the disc. An early anti-smoking cartoon called ""Johnny Smoke""! This classic ""Western"" anti-smoking ad is a musical treat... ""Out of the land of the Tobacco plant comes a tall, fast drawing, long lean look...feared by his friends and enemies alike..and all who come to know the name of Johnny Smoke!"" What is left of this gem is still hilarious. The tune is catchy (as all smoking commercials were) and you will never forget it once you have seen it. There is also a classic Hai Karate Shaving Commercial on Disc 1 that is worthwhile. But the real study here is all of the hype that today appears so ridiculous that we all bought into back then. A LOT of commercials were drawing works by ad agencies and nearly all products were introduced with a KEY type of musical jingle that would brainwash you into remembering the product long after the ad campaign was over. For example, I had not seen the ""Taste of Kent"" commercial in over 30 years, yet I was able to recite the entire work as it was playing on the smoking commercial section on Disc 1. In fact, Tobacco commercials were probably the worst offenders. ""Winston tastes good like a cigarette should."" ""Lucky Strike means fine tobacco (LSMFT)"". ""You can take Salem out of the country but... you can't take the country out of Salem."" ""You've got a lot to like in a Marlboro, filter, flavor, pack or box."" and then Ricky and Lucy selling Phillip Morris Cigarettes, Whew! Such a lot of nonsense! But the discs are a real lesson in advertising history and would be good for any student majoring in this field.",1090454400,3,1817,4.509090909090909
1826023,4,B0000844HL,"I want to add my nod of approval to those of the other reviewers who found this collection worthwhile.
Yes, this looks like, as Johnny Legend would say, ""a below Low-Budget but just a step above No-Budget masterpiece!"" Simple but pleasing cover design, minimal printed info inside, but a well categorized collection of classic TV ads swept from Americana's memories and possibly ""this close"" to being tossed into the fires of video-tape extinction.
Many of the the ads here look like bad 3rd generation transfers from neanderthol VCRs, but the fact that these survive on VHS & DVD at all is just plain cool. You can find TV Ad compilations out there with clean video copy for a select few of the bigtime sponsors from yesteryear. What is harder to come across is the plethora of lesser known commercials. The prime example, from the annals my 1970s youth, are the ""Not Another Hamburger!"" ads by Der Weinerschnitzel, the coolest being Dracula rising out of his coffin, looking up, and gasping in horror, crying ""NO! NO! Anything but that....NOT ANOTHER HAMBURGER!"" I honestly thought I was the only TV obsessed adult who still had that catch-phrase imprinted in my pop-culture memory bank.
You get a detailed look at TV commercial past with the now outlawed cigarette ads, the most mind-bending and hysterical being the spot for Winston Cigarettes featuring..... The Flintsones! If you have not seen this ad where Fred and Barney sneak into the backyard for a Winston break, then you must pick up this DVD. The Flintsones peddling tobacco on its own is worth the price for Classic Commercials!
As many commercials that are featured on this DVD, I can't help but thinking... how many more commercials--- advertising national as well as regional products--- are lying dormant in video vaults, missed, forgotten, overlooked by everybody from DVD producers to pop-culture historians? There are some hep companies, most notably ""Something Weird Video,"" who have revived multitudes of forgotten B-Movie classics and public service films from the video graveyards, and given them a new lustre. I hope more commercials like the ones in this ""Classic Commercials"" collection, whether the video quality is clean or thrashed, surface on DVD.",1088380800,38,2230,5.079019073569483
1826024,4,B0000844HL,"Granted, one should not expect pristine prints of commercials that were not intended for posterity some 30-50 years after they were filmed. However, midway through an intriguing set that includes the Flintstones Winston Commericials, Lucy and Desi's Animated Philip Morris piece, Bugs and Daffy for tang (Daffy actually gets the best of Bugs in this one), and a great Andy and Barney segment for Grape nuts, the picture flickers greatly.
That aside, it's not bad. Baby boomers and Gen Xers will get warm and fuzzy over Josephine the Plumber, ""It's The real Thing,"" ""Get the Barefoot Feeling with Mountain Dew,"" the politically incorrect ""Frito Bandito,"" etc. However, The Malboro Man, The Esso Tiger, ""I Can't Belive I Ate the Whole Thing"" and a few other major spots are missing. But this is good as pop-culture history for most and a walk down memory lane for others.",1087862400,5,869,4.958904109589041
1826025,3,B0000844HL,"I got this box set a few days back, and yes, the quality isn't very good, and living in Australia I've only heard of about half of the products shown. But even so, it's fun to watch and may I say interesting too. They could have done better,did we really need to see 6 or 7 Crest commercials in a row, and some (most) of the editing was very rough, but still, it was cheap and cheerful and I'm glad I bought it.",1083542400,3,411,3.963855421686747
1826026,3,B0000844HL,"This 2 DVD set is a fun collection of commercials for all sorts of products dating from the 1950s through the 1970s.  The first DVD has 9 chapters including Cigarettes & Cigars, Cleaning products, Cosmetics & Medications, Clothes & Accessories, Electronic appliances, Automobiles, Toys, and Public Service Announcements.  The second DVD, which I think is the most fun, has four chapters: Food & Drugs, Celebrities, The Drugstore, and Horror and Sci-Fi. The menu pages are well done and cute with television sets flipping through a selection of commercials complete with static.
There are over 200 commercials here.  Highlights include: an S.O.S. ""opera"" ad on the Garry Moore show, a live demonstration of a Westinghouse refrigerator where the hostess can't get the door open ""somebody's playing games,"" Arthur Godfrey's frank advertisement for Lipton chicken noodle cup of soup on the Talent Scouts show ""there's chicken, you won't find it but it's there,"" a surprising sing-along public service announcement for V.D., the Flintstone's advertising Winston cigarettes (imagine cartoon characters doing that today!), the cute Quisp cereal guy plus Frankenberry, Boo-berry, and Count Chocula, commercial legends Mr. Whipple (""please, don't squeeze the Charmin"") and Rosie (""Bounty: the Quick picker upper""), the famous crying Indian for a pollution public service announcement (one I actually remember!), and a bizarre slogan for Crest toothpaste (""I only got one cavity!""--I guess Crest wanted to leave a little room for error).
Some of the best celebrity spots include the Monkees for Kool-Aid in 1969 after Peter Tork left the band (either Instant Replay or Monkees Present era), the 5th Dimension for Jell-O, the Three Stooges for Simoniz, Andy Griffith and Don Knotts for Post Grapenuts, Lucy and Desi for Philip Morris (""Call for Philip Morriiiis""), Chico and Harpo Marx for Prom home perm (they must have really needed the money, maybe for Chico's gambling debts), Buster Keaton for Hamm's beer, Gale Sayers and Tom Seaver for Phillips 66, Jimmy Durante for Scotties tissues, Dinah Shore for the upcoming '59 Chevy--the list goes on.
Quality is not the best here but, considering the material, it is understandable.  Editing is also a problem as clips of the show or commercial that follows the featured commercial are sometimes left on. Another editing error: the screen shots on the back case of disc one are of commercials that are on disc 2 and vice versa.  Numerous renditions of nearly the same commercial (i.e. Crest, Safeguard soap, Puffs tissues) sometimes bog down the viewing.  If you are interested in old commercials, however, you cannot beat the price of this set. Hopefully, someone will put out a set of old commercials with information like the year it came out, the climate of the times that affected the style and message of the commercial (i.e. the economy), who the celebrity spokesmen are (some I could not recognize, and they are not listed on this set), etc.  Until then, this is a fun set and a nice time machine.  Now let's see some '80s commercials that I will remember!",1079568000,30,3102,5.153081510934394
1826027,3,B0000844HL,"Madacy, the people who made this DVD title, make titles that probobly do not draw a lot of attention. This is probobly why not a lot of money is spent cleaning up content or doing extras. We are talking small Canadian Company, not Walt Disney Home Video here folks. I have seen other Classic Commercial montages before, and this one is not bad. Granted, there really is no special features on this two disc set, but what do you expect for 10 bucks. On most of these commercials, it looks as if the original source has long been gone, and these are copies of the commercials that were inserted in shows before they were sent out to the tv stations. I have read complaints about the editing, but only saw this ture on one or two clips. It looks like some filters WERE used, because several of these commercials I have seen in other compilations, and this is by far the best quality I have seen. Also, remember that the early days of television did not have the best of picture or sound quality. Just looking at an old episode of The Honeymooners should prove that.
In all, this product delivers exactly what it advertises, over 3 and a half hours of non-stop classic commercials. You will see cigarete commercials, Hamms Beer Commercials (From The Land of Sky Blue Waters), toothpaste commercials, Mountain Dew commercials, etc. For 10 bucks, I would like you to show me a Commercial set that pumps in more features for this price.",1076112000,8,1429,4.56420233463035

1826029,1,B0000844HL,"This collection of commercials could have been a masterpiece.  I agree with the previous reviews that mention how some of the commercials end and then you see a few seconds of another program before it goes to the next commercial.  That's a serious editing no-no.  Also, I think it would have been better to have an actor or someone easily recognizable from classic commercials narrate the piece.  They could introduce each commercial, let us know what to look for and how things have changed, and perhaps talk about the product a little and make corny jokes about it.  There is, of course, no narrator.  At the least, it would have been nice if when the commercial comes on, a little box in the corner of the screen lets us know what year the commercial aired.  We aren't even granted this much.  What we get is an endless stream of old commercials with no break (and no narrator in between them to laugh along with us) that just keeps going, and going, ang going... I don't even know if they're in order.  And old black and white commercial advertising soap will come on and that's followed by a more modern looking color commercial for cigarettes.  Are these from the same year or did we jump a decade?  I watched the first disc for about 3 minutes and got bored after viewing 8 cigarette commercials in a row.  I put in the second disc hoping it would get better and it didn't.  This along with the
poor editing make this set awful.  Save your money and wait for
another company to come out with a set of classic commercials.  I'm sure that anyone would be able to do a better job.",1073606400,7,1585,4.43598615916955
1826030,1,B0000844HL,"Did you ever a have a VHS tape that you used to tape things over and over and over and over on - a virtual patchwork of football hilites or music videos from the early days of cable? Or you taped a tv show while watching it and tried to edit out all the commercials? You know the tape....after one scene ends you hit the pause button just a second too late and catch the first few frames of the next scene (a couple dozen times all throughout the tape). Take that tape, don't edit or remaster it, and transfer it to DVD, and this is the production quality of this set.
Buddy, I'm not kidding. This thing is so bad that there are some commercials you can't even make out what the product is because the brightness level is way too high and/or the audio is so garbled.  And I'm not kidding when I say that there are commercials that end, then you see a second or two of some other program, then the screen goes black and a new commercial begins.  Incredible. Besides that, there is no documentation that lists all of the commercials included. Most of the commercials are in b&w from the very early days of television though I doubt even back then the picture quality was as bad as it is on some of these spots.
I honestly could not help but laugh when I watched this DVD - just marveling at how half-assed it was put together. It's just unbelievable that a company would release something this unprofessional and that a retailer like Best Buy would carry it.",1073174400,4,1456,4.310218978102189
1826031,4,B0000844HL,"If you're looking for a collection of television commercials from the 50s through the 70s, then this is the item to get.  Just be aware that the DVD was put together a little shoddy.  I'm not complaining about the quality of the commercials themselves (although a little noise reduction would have been nice).  However, since chapter stops are placed before a block of commercials sharing a common theme instead of individual clips, you may have a hard time viewing your favorite.
On the plus side, you get what's promised for a low price.  It's a nice little time waster that will appeal to those who are into television history.  If this is your cup of tea, then it's more than worth the price.  Just don't expect slick DVD visuals and you won't be dissapointed.",1071619200,3,764,4.664179104477612
1826032,1,B0000844HL,"Granted, I've only gone through 10 or 20 commercials in this collection that claims to contain over 300, but I doubt I go much further than I already have. Apparently someone owns the rights to any real good commercials of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I've watched Bing Crosby do a Ducks Unlimited piece, John Wayne to a Cancer Society segment and Fibur Mcgee of radio fame (so he tells us) do a plug for the National Association of Retired Persons. There are a lot of great commercials out there, I've yet to see one make this collection.",1064793600,2,532,4.438775510204081
1826033,4,B0000844HL,"As other reviewers have stated, the picture quality here is indeed horrible. I am pretty generous with Lo-fi visual resources, and couldn't imagine it being as bad as they said. But they are correct, without exaggeration. Most of the visuals here are murky, artifact-filled, distorted in color, intermittently ghosty, contrasty and in and out of focus (though mostly out). The quality doesn't really stand up even at the postage stamp-sized viewing window of the typical internet Quicktime trailer. It's that awful. You are going to have to work with this set, and want to like it a lot.
Which I did. It's a testimony to the strength of the basic content that these problems don't come close to destroying the smile-inducing curiosity and nostalgia inherent in the material. If you want it to be 1962 again, or if you are a student of advertising, popular culture or the history of television-- and you can overlook abysmal picture quality-- these disks deliver. There is a longer Speedy Alka Seltzer spot than I have ever seen, some very cool minimal Tom Terrific- or UPA-style animation. Great advertising characters abound (included is that venerable icon of political incorrectness, the Frito Bandito, voiced by the great Mel Blanc). And if you've read reprints of MAD magazines first ten years, you will be able to view, possibly for the first time, some of the targets of their most memorable advertising satire (the Bandaid boiling egg test), as well as some of those bizarre cryptic references in Bill Elder and Harvey Kurtzman's zany, teeming panels (""...the foaming cleanser, BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOMMM...""; ""How're you fixed for blades, man?""). Arthur Godfrey appears here as the style of soft sell pitchman probably known to recent generations only through Paul Harvey. (The goal was to seem to capture the pitchman, taking a break from his show, in a casual conversational mode about a product he actually used.)
Even with the image quality issues, I recommend this set. It's amusing, innocent fun, occasionally borderline embarrassing, and often rather surreal. In the end, it's revelatory. --You may find yourself wondering, were we ever really this unself-conscious, this unironic, this innocent? I know how I'd answer those questions. But take a look and decide for yourself.
PS: The single content quibble I have with the collection, by the way (which may be major to you) is that there are surprisingly few cereal commercials here. When I think of childhood, I probably think of those entertaining animated cereal commercials, even ahead of toy commercials.",1058227200,26,2579,5.084905660377358
1826034,4,B0000844HL,"The people who complain about 'poor audio/video quality' remind me of people who won't watch silent movies because they look scratchy, the action is 'jumpy' and of course, no sound. These commercials were probably discarded after being shown the nunber of times they'd originally been paid for. For all we know they were taken from various vaults, garages, broom closets, etc. Just as tens of thousands of educational films are already lost, imagine what becomes of a commercial after its been shown and then tossed out...
Having said that, this is a fun collection. My personal fav. is the 'V.D.' Public Service Announcement, as imagining that playing now is...unimaginable! Also seeing older characters such as Rosie and Mr Whipple is always good. Some ads are downright bizarre, like the Kool Aid ad with 3 of the Monkees, and Bugs Bunny thrown in for no reason. Having been born in 1974, I can't imagine a time when cigarettes were advertised on TV, but here's the proof!
Also interesting to note how Crest toothpaste busts into the 70's head first, featuring african americans as college professors, etc. Try finding that even now!
Hopefully there will be more of this. Come on! Where's the Kal Kan 'disappearing vitamin' ad? Or Kool-Aid's 'Oh Yeah!' pitcher guy? Bring them on! I'll gladly fork over another 10 bucks for it hehehe.",1058054400,26,1337,4.946666666666666

The mastering is pretty poor, with most of the commercials culled from what looks like a second generation VHS tape. Although some reviewers refer to the fact that the poor quality is to be expected - they are actually missing the point. Firstly 90% of these commercials are fully available in excellent prints (if you know where to look, that is) and secondly any DVD which has been mastered from VHS tape is going to look pretty ropey!
Worth the money if you know what you're getting - just don't expect 21st century digital magic to restore what are lousey copies of the commercials in the first place. The quanity, which is great, just about balances out the quality, which is poor...",1051574400,2,880,4.720779220779221

7978884,1,B0000844HL,"Some of the commercials were fun but a lot of the fun ones that I remember were left out.  Plus, my biggest complaint is the quality of the picture.  Most of the commercials were very annoying because I feel like if we still had rabbit ears on the tv they would have to be adjusted for a better picture.  The picture was very fuzzy and poor color.  I would not recommend this.",1419897600,,376,4.180555555555555
7978885,3,B0000844HL,"The quality of the individual commericals varies greatly. You can tell that several of these were copied from poorly-preserved video tape, resulting in in a wash effect which makes a few of them look like they were filmed in 3-D. Still, there are some great commercials I remember and a few funny ones I don't. If you get it cheap enough it's worth it.",1311033600,,352,4.515625
7978886,3,B0000844HL,"This two disc set is worth it for those interested in old advertising, jingles, popular culture and nostalgia.  The quality is lacking, of course, some of the animated adverts especially suffer as you can't see the product or labels.  But I have a decent set of eyes, and this is acceptable when you take into account that these are ads that weren't expected to be around even a year after they were produced.

Ideally I would like a set like this to give a little background on some of these ads, as you hear a lot of the same narrators (or similar sounding).  Obviously, due to the relative low production value of the the set, there are relatively few (or none) of the ""big"" companies like Coca-cola, Kellog cereals, beer companies (you get a few Hamm's and Black Label ads but only one Budweiser ad, for example).  But still, this set has a great array of ads.  And this is definitely going to be rewatched.",1191110400,,911,4.490909090909091
7978887,2,B0000844HL,These DVD's seem to  be a real bargain.  However I gave them as a gift at Christmas and was very embarrassed.  My brother has many of the commercials on VHS and the quality is far better.  Why are they selling such bad quality when it is obvious there are better masters out there.  There are many complaints about the sound and with good reason.  With just a little effort the sound could be improved.  And I am astounded at the number of commercials that are totally out of sync.  That is a very easy fix.  This set is cheap... in more than one way.,1167868800,6,551,4.221153846153846
7978888,5,B0000844HL,"Simply put, this package offers the most bang for the buck. Yes, many have stated the picture and sound quality is not great at times, but I dare you to find more content for the price! Lets hope the folks at Madacy release another volume of Classic Commercials for us to enjoy!",1159315200,5,278,4.365384615384615

7978890,5,B0000844HL,"Here is an awesome collection of 200+ television commercials from yesteryear. Even from ""back in the day"" when tobacco was advertised over the air(forbidden by the FCC since January 1971). The pop music group The Monkees endorsed Kool Aid in or around 1966. You can see all your favorite products from breakfast cereals to laundry detergents in this collection. I even have two VHS videos distributed by Goodtimes Home Video entitled CELEBRITY COMMERCIALS and THOSE CRAZY 'OL COMMERCIALS. Some commercials from those videos are even in this collection. However,I'm sorry to say because of the ages and lack of airing in the last few decades,many of these commercials are of poor quality in both video and audio. Not like the commercials we see on television today. Some of these products advertised have been long out-of-production. For many of the products still made today,the designs have even changed(I'm sure we all know that). SO if you're into vintage stuff,this item is a must! It will bring back many memories.",1144108800,9,1019,5.071428571428571
