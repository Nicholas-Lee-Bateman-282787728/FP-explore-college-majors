8557531,3,B00ATGD1W4,"This is a nice piece for any James Dean fan to add to their collection but it was not the insight I was hoping for. I thought it would offer never before seen or never before known information and tidbits into the mind of James Dean since it was supposed to be his diary but I had heard these things before. Quotes read from Jimmy have been used before so where was the diary part? The producer claims to be the only one who read the diary but it offered nothing new. Where is the diary? Why didn't the audience see pages in Jimmy's own writing instead of having it acted out that he was writing? There were no dates given. When did Jimmy start the diary? What was the last entry? I'm sure he would have doodled but the audience got to see nothing of this. Instead it was quotes and not insight to his feelings or fears or frustrations like a diary might have. The film seemed more set on responding to rumors and allocations. For example, the point about Jimmy's sexuality was argued. I say who cares? His was an artistic soul so he would have experienced what he wanted and not worry about what others thought. The part I did like was taking the blame off Jimmy for the accident. He was not speeding at 57 miles per hour. Still, the saddest part is hearing that if he had gone a little faster he would have been past the spot where it happened or if he was going a little slower, he would have missed the other car's turning. It was also interesting to hear what some of his friends said about what Jimmy planned for the future. He is missed. He was and always will be the best actor we have known and a genius in the making.",1371427200,2,1627,4.201277955271565
