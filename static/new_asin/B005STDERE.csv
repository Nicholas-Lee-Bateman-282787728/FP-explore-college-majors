8485440,4,B005STDERE,It's a good interview with Jacques and you learn about his past and experiences but it's fairly short compared to the first half of it he show which deals with another subject. Charlie Rose is an excellent host and interviewer so I gave it 4 stars. But if you're looking for an hour long interview with Jacques this isn't it.,1470700800,,325,4.433333333333334
