8528198,5,B008HRNN52,These guys are crazy to race on the road at that speed with all the imperfections of a road rather than a racetrack.,1375747200,,116,4.086956521739131

8528200,5,B008HRNN52,"This is real road racing! A motorcycle race on the streets around an island. Better than Long Beach Grand Prix. 600cc bikes doing 170+ mph in 6th gear at 15,000 rpm. Open class (1000cc) bikes doing 180, 190+ in the Superbike race. Wheelies, tank slappers, and pushing the bikes to their limits and beyond. Car racing is boring compared to this.",1369699200,,344,4.655737704918033
8528201,5,B008HRNN52,"Full of action packed full race footage and extras from the most exciting, and dangerous race in the world! Must see!",1364601600,,117,4.619047619047619
8528202,5,B008HRNN52,Well done! Lots of great footage and all the races. Unfortunately the senior TT was canceled in 2012 due to weather. Highly recommend. If you don't know anything about the Isle of Man TT then you are missing the most heroic race in the world hands down.,1360368000,,253,4.404255319148936

8528204,4,B008HRNN52,"Basically into road races, this races tops them all. The video comes close but, not close enough. There seem to be alot of talk and not enough action but, that could be just me. I did like the way they broke down the indivudual racing segments. I would have like to seen more of the mechinical side of the race bikes. To sum it up, I guess you have to go and do it if you want to see more.",1359504000,,389,3.875
8528205,5,B008HRNN52,"I bought this video to investigate traveling to the Mann. I was looking for where would be the best place to watch the race...a helicopter. Sidecar racing had two feature races,Cool. Electrics were ho hum. Straight racing not much on side show antics. As for the coverage, it was quite good and graphics too.",1356134400,,308,4.722222222222222
