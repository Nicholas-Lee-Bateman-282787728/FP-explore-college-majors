647302,4,6303433782,this is one of the best movies too emerge and seeing on DVD is only better. the performances are top notch and the filming of the movie is also very good. JULIA gives a good performance as well the rest of the cast. Everyone should like this movie even if it is a chick flick cause in our way's we can relate too friendship and relatinships.,984700800,,341,4.181818181818182
647303,5,6303433782,"Mystic Pizza is a great introduction to the acting talent of Annabeth Gish, Julia Roberts, and Lily Taylor.  All three did an excellent job portraying their lovestruck characters.  Julia Roberts plays the boy chasing flirt who can play pool with the best of them.  Annabeth is the straight A full-scholarship sister who falls in love with a man she can't have.  Lily plays the confused, cold-footed engaged friend who can't decide what exactly she wants out of life until one day....",978480000,4,483,4.925925925925926
647304,3,6303433782,"This film will help an empty evening pass by quite nicely.
It is the tale of 3 (female) friends who work in a pizza restaurant, and their complicated love lives.
The characters within it are slightly cliched, which tends to give it an unchallenging homely feel.
There are few surprises and nothing that offends.  Overall a 'nice' film, best served with a glass of red wine after a stressful day.",974246400,13,395,4.642857142857143
647305,5,6303433782,This is such a good movie I can't believe it is not for sale!  I have to agree with the other viewers that it took me back a few years but boy did it make me feel good.  They should definetly release this again!  My  husband got tired of paying for rentals for this movie so he found it for  me on an Internet auction site.  Everytime I say that I want to watch it he  says oh that again but I think he secretly likes it just as much as I do.  After seeing this movie it is no wonder why Julia is such a big star.,959299200,5,513,3.685185185185185

647587,3,6303433782,"I started watching this movie under the impression Id never seen it before; about 20 minutes into it, I wasn't so sure. When it ended, I still didn't know if Id seen it before this viewing. Perhaps its the number of familiar faces & tropes; for a 30 year old movie, it held up relatively well and Id be willing to watch it again.

Of note -
(1) Throughout the film I couldn't place the pizza parlor owner. Shes played by Conchata Ferrell, better known as Two and a Half Mens housekeeper Berta.
(2) Actor Lili Taylors saucy pizza waitress reminded me a lot of Cheers Carla Tortelli Lebec, so much so that it distracted me from her storyline. Which leads me to my next point -
(3) The pizza parlor owner (Ferrell) her co-owner husband, and the three waitresses (portrayed by Taylor, Julia Roberts, & Annabeth Gish) are all Portuguese. Their ethnicity is referenced multiple times throughout the film; its essential to the plot. Suspension of disbelief or no, at some point not only was it difficult to believe that an actor with Anglo-Saxon-Scandinavian ancestry is Portuguese, it served as a source of irritation.
(4) Roberts waitress has quite the potty mouth on her, at least for a late 1980s romcom. The swearing for the sake of doing so becomes tiresome.

Despite the bashing I just delivered, the movie is relatively innocuous & it ends on enough of an uptick that Im sticking with my three star rating. I wouldnt seek out Mystic Pizza, but I wouldnt race to change the channel.",1517961600,,1482,4.6311787072243344

647674,4,6303433782,"In the small coastal town of Mystic, Connecticut, there is the title pizzeria run by an elder Portuguese couple with three young women as waitresses, two sisters who don't get along and their friend. The pizza served at the establishment is known to have a secret recipe which makes it especially wonderful, as a food critic in the story points out.

The elder sister is set to go to Yale on a partial scholarship, while the younger one is less responsible and meets a young man from a rich family, hoping he might provide a means for her to leave her small town life. Their friend was set to marry her fianc, but she fails to go through with it despite the fact the she still wants him. The sisters find romance, but said relationships do not go smoothly.

Rather overlong and predictable, though the movie is notable for Matt Damon's first (minor) movie role and one of Julia Roberts' early starring roles.",1507852800,,908,4.564417177914111

647972,4,6303433782,"I'm 70 years old, just watched this movie for the third time, and I love it as much now as the first time I saw it. It is, in turns, funny, dramatic and poignant, with doses of heartache and feel-good. It's about 3 young women in a small fishing town, learning about life and love and their accompanying joys and disappointments. I thought all three actresses in the main roles--Annabeth Gish, Lili Taylor, and the (then) relatively unknown Julia Roberts--were very good in playing their characters, though I especially got a kick out of Taylor as the exuberant JoJo in her struggle to remain true to herself while being passionately in love with Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio) who wanted her to make a life commitment. I'd categorize it as a romantic ""dramedy"" (Webster says it's a real word). In so many places it reminds me of my feelings and experiences at the age of these characters. I'm sure I'll watch it again.",1489104000,9,913,4.6770186335403725

648798,5,6303433782,"The storyline has already been hashed and rehashed. My reason for rating this movie so highly is partly from nostalgia and partly because I loved it the first time I watched it, and continue to watch it at least once a year.

One critic actually claimed that the movie, 'may someday become known for the movie stars it showcased back before they became stars'. That was pretty prescient because Matt Damon's first role was in this movie, it was Robert's breakout role (this was supposed to have been a vehicle for Annabeth Gish), and it was certainly a stepping stone for Vincent D'Onofrio. I definitely came away as a staunch Lili Taylor fan, which means that, by extension, I am an indie fan as well since that is the professional career path she chose.

Regarding the story itself, it's not spellbinding, but is entertaining to the point of being charming. The back stories were fairly predictable, but, again, entertaining.

For me, it began a personal love affair with New England, largely based on the cinematography, so when I had an opportunity to take a consulting assignment in Rhode Island I jumped at the chance and the first week made the trek to Mystic Seaport and even enjoyed a pizza with my girlfriend du jour there. While the pizzeria was subsequently remodeled to resemble the movie set, it looked different when I was there fourteen years after the film was released.

The movie, though, is a fun watch made all the more fun by knowing that most of the actors were relative unknowns in 1988 and some are now household names.",1446076800,2,1544,4.707407407407407
648799,5,6303433782,"i just finished watching this movie and was pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoyed it. I was just looking for a good comedy & this was listed as a comedy. I would not call this strictly a comedy because there was also some sadness in the movie.

This movie is about 3 women who worked in a pizza place--2 sisters and a friend. Even though the 3 women were so different from each other their relationship with one other worked. Even with their differences they still had two things in common--their loyalty & their love for one another. Even when one of the sisters (Roberts) was angry with her sister, when her sister was hurting and needed someone, Roberts was there for her.  This movie was about relationships--relationships between friends, between friends and their families and relationships with the women and their boyfriends.

This is the first time I have seen Julia Roberts in a movie in a long time and she did not disappoint. She gave an excellent performance as well as the other actresses.

There were no sex scenes in it per say, but enough that I would not want young children to see this movie--a little too mature for kids. Some profanity, but only occasionally--not real frequent.

All in all I enjoyed this movie and am glad that I watched it.",1445904000,5,1267,4.613333333333333

On the other hand, the babysitter does get her heart broken by the handsome dad of the darling little girl.

649845,5,6303433782,"There is an entire series of literature devoted to the young woman trying to land a husband while balancing the other aspects of life.  This film is part of the genre and it is an excellent example thereof.  The film revolves around three girls:

Kat (Annabeth Gish)
Daisy (Julia Roberts)
Jojo (Lili Taylor)

Kat and Daisy are sisters and Jojo is a dear friend to both.  They all work at the Mystic Pizza joint and serve excellent pizza.  The three girls are also working class girls and Kat and Daisy are of Portuguese extraction rather than the English Puritan descended upper class/majority in the area.  Jojo is in a situation where she needs to decide to marry or not marry her man and the movie starts with her getting cold feet at her wedding.  The other two girls also start relationships with potential husbands.  Kat becomes involved with an older professional whose wife is not around.  Kat develops deep feelings for the man and one seems is quite willing to become wife and step mother.  However, Kat's plans are thwarted when the wife returns.  She thus learns a very hard lesson.  Daisy's love interest has great potential but he turns out to have serious issues with integrity.  There is of course, deliberate ethnic animosity towards Northeastern Anglos-after all the movie's production team is Levinson and Rosenfelt, but this should not cloud the overall moral message of this excellent film.

Civilization, as well as the happiness that comes to a woman when has the chance to create a family, are dependent upon the choices that young women make in their nubile years.  The temptation for a sensitive, intelligent young woman to try and move in on a charming and steady, but married, man must be quite sharp.  Additionally, the compromises one makes with sex and marriage are very important.  Sex outside of marriage has the potential to become a limited, illicit, and sterile amusement, but within the institution it has the chance to bring about a healthy next-generation.  Additionally, all that glitters is not gold.  The solid integrity of a working class waterman is more important than the iffy behavior of a wealthy scion.

In short, one meets these three charming, pretty, and intelligent girls and one immediately hopes for their happiness.  While this movie is a light, ""chick-flick"" it carries an important message.  All of this is excellently done by a cast (then relatively unknown) but now recognizable excellent professional actors and actresses.",1439769600,,2483,4.958837772397095

650723,4,6303433782,"Being an American of Portuguese decent this is one of my all time favorite movies. My family is from around Mystic and my ancestors were Azorean Portuguese fishermen. Having served with the U.S. Embassy in Portugal, I found some of the cultural windows (i. e. , Rodrigo singing fado) to be authentic. My bias should be very obvious. If you like mushy romance, there are three separate romance stories in this movie. If you are a Julia Roberts fan, she looks great in this one, but when does she not look great?",1433808000,,510,4.554347826086956
650724,4,6303433782,"I'm really getting too old for this kind of movie, but I had heard it often referred to and thought I would try it out.  It turns out that it's pleasant and unpretentious, and it works by playing with stereotypes and upsetting our expectations a bit.  The situation is itself a bit of a cliche -- young folks wanting to break away from small-town life and not always making wise decisions while trying to do so -- but by the end, nothing has been artificially closed off or settled, and that's satisfying, given that the characters are all still young.  One feels that possibilities of change and growth are still open to them.  Lili Taylor and Julia Roberts were 21 when this movie came out, and Annabeth Gish was 17, and they play to their real ages.  All give very satisfying performances.  Gish and Roberts are the Arujo sisters, Kat and Daisy, who are Portuguese-Americans living in the small fishing town of Mystic, CT, and Taylor is their friend, Jojo Barbosa.  Kat has been accepted at Yale, JoJo is involved with Bill Montijo (Vincent D'Onofrio), a young local fisherman, and Daisy is rebelliously trying to have a sexual life that might help her make the move from Mystic.  All three work for Leona at Mystic Pizza, and Leona's pizza sauce recipe is assumed to be one of the wonders of the world.  When Hector Freshette, television's ""Fireside Gourmet"" (Louis Turenne) arrives to rate the restaurant, all are on tenterhooks . . .

The charm of the movie lies in the way the young women's roles both reference and subvert stereotypes.  First of all, all are sexually curious and explorative, and in their relationships seem less passive than supposedly vulnerable young women are usually taken to be.  Kat (Gish) falls for the older smooth, married man she babysits for while his wife is off working in England, and she's the one most deeply hurt -- but she also makes the running to sexualize the relationship, and it's not clear what she expects of it.  Does she even know herself?  Gish does a good job with the role, convincing us of both the pain of her loss (however she might see that) when the wife returns and the uncertainty of how exactly to make herself available to this attractive man.  She isn't seduced, and she doesn't seduce -- it's a delicate little dance, and Gish brings it off.

JoJo plays with a broader stereotype: instead of the man wanting sex and the girl wanting commitment, here it's the other way around.  Taylor plays JoJo as a slightly crazy character and shows no embarrassment in doing so.  The film is formally rounded off with her wedding at the end -- when we had thought that we might see it at the beginning.  Daisy's situation looks back to ""Pretty in Pink"" and forward to ""Pretty Woman.""  But here the rich young guy she goes after in fact doesn't exactly let her down in the way that Andrew McCarthy did Molly Ringwald in ""Pretty in Pink.""  In the most ethically interesting scene, she accuses him of using her, not for sex, but to get at his parents, with whom his relations are, to put it mildly, fraught.  She has a point, but we can't help thinking that she in turn is perhaps using him to get away from her life in Mystic -- and we notice too that he, for his part, doesn't accuse her of that.

All in all then, good work by some attractive young actors.  The older characters -- Kat's and Daisy's mother and Leona -- are more predictable, Leona being the earth-mother wise woman figure with a magic touch in pizza and in empathy.  Pleasant viewing, and well worth checking out.",1433462400,,3534,4.571428571428571

Unlike ""Say Anything"" and its ilk, however, ""Mystic Pizza"" just does not.  A great performance by Lili Taylor stands out so many years later, and the rest of the actors are fine, but the story and dialogue seem stilted.

It is also an insightful look at how young women view love, sex and marriage and their own individual place in the world. Spoiler alert: I found the love affair with the older man a little unbelievable, not that she wouldn't think about it but that he would but overall it was a very good movie.",1391040000,,538,4.434343434343434

Julia Roberts in one of her first major roles, is charming, and Lili Taylor is so great. Careful now, that's Lili Taylor, not Liv Tyler (Stephen's daughter). I remember this movie from when I was a young thing, and watched it again the other day. Still good. OH! For you Law & Order fans, Vincent D'Onofrio as a young(ish) hottie. Great story about first loves, being a young woman and trying to stand up for yourself, and getting seduced by the mystery and allure of older (and supposedly wiser) men. Pretty tame in terms of body parts and language, although definitely some swearing and a bit of skin (no naughty bits that I can recall).

Great movie for Mom and Daughters, a teenage movie night, or for those of use who were teens in the 80s to have a nostalgic moment.",1390867200,,872,4.518987341772152

It totally doesn't turn out that way. It's just a wholesome sweet movie and it wasn't even over the top corny or necessarily dated either. It was three very relatable characters going through somewhat typical situation or predicaments a young woman might face.
I liked the movie. It's just amazing how movies today can't get away with being wholesome unless disney makes it. It's like everyone needs, feeds, on the real traumatizing drama. If something unthinkable doesn't happen to one of the characters then people think it wasn't a good movie. But this movie wasn't like that, and that was a real breath of fresh air.

The better parts of the movie were the showcasing of the Portuguese-American culture in Mystic, Julia Roberts' character and acting, and the always entertaining Conchata Ferrell, as the pizza shop owner/cook. The other main characters were annoying and uninteresting. Lily Taylor and Vincent D'Onforio were bad in this movie, they over-acted and just appeared goofy for much of the movie. A shame really because they have both been great in other roles. The actress who played Kat was awful and made me not give a crap about her story-line at all.  Overall, I do recommend this movie to be seen..but only once.

Their corny problems and appearances inspired my contempt and disgust back then. I bet if I watched it again it would be even worse for the wear, like Ally McBeal. Not one of the characters is appealing. The females are all insulting charicatures and stereotypes. There is the college nerd, the slacker sexpot, and the hopeless romantic feeling inner conflicts about her fear of commitment. The college nerd is getting mixed up with this total a hole, all but neutered, married preppy guy. Not one single thing to fantasize about there. The sexpot wants to ""get away"" from the seaside town (spare me, like you could pretend Connecticut is some place in Nebraska) and the third girl - I don't even remember her story, utterly forgettable. One part I disliked intensely is that they wear the absolute worst of 90's fashion and they negate any romance from the lovely northeast Colonial landscape. It's like - way to cheapen our beautiful northeastern seaside coast, thanks for that. Just reminds me of all the worst parts of growing up in a seaside town.

652802,4,6303433782,"Growing up in Connecticut and visiting Mystic frequently, watching `Mystic Pizza' was like a trip home for me.  I was actually pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable a trip it really was.  My sisters rave this movie, especially since they spent most of their lives in and around the seaport, so viewing their old stomping grounds and taking in that small town atmosphere is something you can't do every day.  For a film of this nature, `Mystic Pizza' gets a lot right, and while it isn't the most memorable experience it certainly puts some real talent on display (this was one of Julia Roberts first roles) and helped launch a few careers.

The film tells of sisters and their friend who are living their lives, working in a pizzeria and learning to grow up.  Daisy is the rebel, Kat is the high achiever and Jo, their friend, is a commitment phobe with some deep rooted issues.  The three of them learn to love and live over the course of the film, coming into their own and finding path in life, with and without men attached.

Roberts is a dream here.  She is a star, always has been, and this is further proof of that.  She's a natural, and while Gish was more the central star of the film Roberts steals every scene.  Like I said, this isn't the most memorable film, and it suffers in part from the 80's `melodramatic' tones, but it manages to come together in a palatable way, giving us an entertaining film that says a lot without feeling too heavy.",1373414400,,1456,4.501901140684411

Sure, Annabeth Gish gave a choppy performance, amateurish in places, but an actor has to start somewhere and she turned out great (I'm thinking of Beautiful Girls). Stupidly enough, Amazon lists her as the primary star, although Julia Roberts had an equally prominent role. She did well. The early performances of Lili Taylor and Vincent D'onofrio were amazingly spot-on. All in all, an eminently watchable film.

A bit of trivia: Annabeth Gish did have a grandmother named Lillian, but she was not the Lillian Gish of Hollywood fame.",1363219200,,612,4.884615384615385

652879,4,6303433782,"If you read the reviews of this movie, it generally gets positive comments. It is sort of a coming-of-age movie about some girls in a small east coast town. Mystic Pizza is the name of the pizza place where they work. There is a girl who is engaged to a local fisherman but has second thoughts about wanting to be married even though she loves the guy. There is the studious and serious girl who is planning on going off to Yale who ends up involved with a married guy for whom she takes a summer babysitting job. Then there is the energetic and fun-loving girl who ends up involved with a rich kid. There are a number of points where the plot seems to be headed towards a sad and ugly incident, but somehow these are always avoided and things mostly turn out OK. The incidents in this movie are not especially innovative or unique, but they are well and tastefully done so that the end product is enjoyable to watch and you end up feeling like you are seeing the story of real people you can relate to in some ways. The setting of the movie is also refreshingly down-to-earth. The pizza place is a local joint run by a tough but caring woman who has a secret formula for her pizza. The vehicles seen in the movie are sort of old and are the kinds of cars and trucks you might expect people to drive. The girls belong to a family of Portuguese descent which adds a unique flavor to the movie without being overbearing. If you are looking for a pleasant, well-done romantic drama that isn't over the top, this is a classic.",1343520000,,1522,4.306620209059234

652949,4,6303433782,"I saw this movie a long time ago,its nearing its  25th anniversary and now that i look back i'm surprised at how good a movie it is. Julia roberts became famous for a string of hits including pretty woman-notting hill-my best friend's wedding...among other films which had a stamp of a kind of image,which writers often stayed tuned to although the image was changed later in films like the not well received duplicity and eat pray love. Especially i guess when fans are used to an actress in a certain role and type they have trouble seeing a changed role or gravitating to a different kind of role. Anyways we have here a very atmospheric film,with the boats and waterways and the guys roughing it for a living and the pizza parlour. They add flavor to the film about small towns. The film centers on a set of relationships and its really a cast film,there are stars but the large cast is really the star and there relationship with each other. The bonding between the men and the women and the relationship of men and women and how jealousy builds and emotions especially among the women is what the film is all about. Young love! An interesting scene is when the young lovers make out in a home where the parents are upstairs with a sacred heart of jesus statue in their midst. The religios icon disturbs the male,who is upset by it,his wanting committment and some kind of relationship
purpose,and the females in the film seem to be more sexualized than the males,but its a film more from the female point of view. There is also a sign of ethnic values in this film,and trying to find some purpose in things,and i do like the reversal of typical male female roles in this film. An interesting film and the atmosphere and environment add much to film making it unique.",1333238400,,1772,4.5375

I do have to say that I never could see what she saw in the short skinny rich boy and wished for a taller better looking guy in the roll but what are ya gonna do. It's just a really well acted, well directed, beautifully filmed movie. It stands the test of time very well and is a very good look at Julia before she was JULIA.",1327708800,3,642,3.900763358778626

Mystic Pizza is probably better known now for being Matt Damon's first appearance onscreen (with a terrible, hilarious haircut no less) and for helping to launch Julia Roberts towards stardom, but it's also an enjoyable little picture--it's neither great nor terribly memorable, but if you want a film that focuses on women that's not stupid or manipulative, check out Mystic Pizza.

653032,4,6303433782,"Mystic Pizza is a workplace drama that takes place on the East Coast in the town of Mystic, Connecticut. It was filmed at the actual pizza parlor that inspired Amy Jones to write the story, in the town of Mystic at 55 West Main St. After the movie came out the joint became very popular. The movie isn't that great, but like pizza, even a bad pizza is still pretty good. Hey, it's pizza. The town is a fishing village with a high concentration of Portuguese, which is what Daisy (Julia Roberts) and Kat Arujo (Annabeth Gish) are. They have so much lobster there that the locals actually get tired of it. That's when they go out for pizza.

Mystic Pizza is best remembered as the film that launched Julia Roberts on the road to stardom. Her smile lights up the silver screen, and it is very apparent that the camera loves her. It was also among the first films to feature Annabeth Gish and Lili Taylor. It marks the feature film debut of Matt Dammon as well, but he has such a small part that if you blink you can miss it. His character, Steamer, has the immortal line: ""Hey, mom, do you want your green stuff?"" Ben Affleck auditioned for the part as well. Why am I not surprised?

Two other actors in Mystic Pizza are very familiar due to television: Conchata Ferrell plays Charlie Sheen's housekeeper Berta on Two and a Half Men and Vincent D'Onofrio is familiar from Law & Order: Criminal Intent. In Mystic Pizza he is much younger and skinnier, and his character, Billy, a fisherman who still lives at home with his mother, wants to marry Jo Jo (Lili Taylor) but she is the one who is afraid of commitment. She faints at her wedding and can't go through with it.

Meanwhile the Arujo sisters are quite different from each other. Katherine, or Kat as she's called, is the serious one, who works several jobs besides the pizza gig, saving up to go to Yale and study astronomy. Daisy is a different story, a pool hustler and party animal, she falls for a rich preppy, Charles Gordon Windsor, Jr (Adam Storke). She worries that she won't fit in with his rich family, but he has some issues of his own. He has been kicked out of law school for cheating, and that didn't go over very well with daddy. Neither does his choice of Daisy, but will true love prevail? Stay tuned. As for Kat, one of Kat's jobs is as a babysitter, but she falls for the father while the wife's away in London.

Finally, Leona, the owner of the restaurant, needs a good review from the local food critic to drum up business. If he would only taste the pizza, which is made from a secret family recipe, he would taste that it was... well, Mystic. Only trouble is he is notoriously fussy and hard to please.

The four story lines are interwoven well, and though it is not earth shattering drama, it is very enjoyable watching, with good acting, some funny and some emotional scenes, and a good location in Mystic, Connecticut. Plus, watching Roberts, Gish, and Taylor as pizza waitresses is kind of like watching them before they were stars. Which none of them are... yet.

653037,3,6303433782,"Despite the fact that Julia Roberts' face is displayed predominantly on the cover of this DVD, it's not a vehicle just for her. It maybe set her on the way to stardom, but she's in no way a great actress in this. She's the 'pretty' one of the film.

I picked this film for dead cheap months ago, and have never been in the mood for watching it. Until a couple of days ago, I put it in the DVD player and discovered a sweet film which reminded me slightly of Steel Magnolias and has possibly influenced a lot of other films in recent years. It's a predictable story, about two sisters and a friend, waitressing in a pizza place, caught in the summer after leaving school, and what to do with the rest of their lives.

You know where it goes from here. We've got the one who loves her boyfriend very much, but is so scared of commitment that she faints at the altar, played wonderfully by Lili Taylor. She's the friend. Then one sister who babysits only to fall for the kid's dad, played by Annabeth Gish. And then what could politely be called as the 'woman about town', by Julia Roberts, who falls for a rich guy, and makes an embarrassment of herself in front of his snobby parents.

It's a pretty much uneventful film, big hair, big clothes, big eighties film. There's not much to comment on, unless you spot Matt Damon in a family scene, given one line, for one of his first film roles. Apart from that, it's good enough to waste some time on a very lonely weekend.",1184544000,2,1468,4.311594202898551

And this delightful picture elapses between the lives and times of these three adorable women; each one of them with her dreams and love affairs; someone of them fortunate; others simply a beauty illusion.

As you may guess this summer breeze picture has all what you wish to seduce you. Enrapturing landscapes, spontaneous performances, splendid script and a delirious scent to pizza hard to forget.

Interestingly, Gish's name appears before Roberts in the credits at the end. Gish has gone on to a productive career, mostly in television, Taylor has moved into a career in more independent, quirky movies while Roberts has gone on to...well, you know.

I read Roger Ebert's review and he gave the movie 3 1/2 starts (out of 4) when it came out. I wouldn't rate it that high (maybe 2 1/2 or 3 out of 4), but the movie has kind of a comfortable feeling to it and gets better as it goes along. You don't see many movies about work & work environments these days and I think the scenes in the Mystic Pizza Parlor are pretty good. The romantic storylines are pretty standard and as Ebert says, ""The movie isn't really about three girls in love; it's about three girls discovering what their standards for love are going to be."" All-in-all I liked the movie. Oh, and watch carefully for Matt Damon in his big-screen debut!",1151712000,12,1092,4.4874371859296485

I regretted buying a new copy after all, remembering it only as a few heartwarming (I didn't want my heart warmed) months in the lives of just plain folks in CT.  (Incidentally, the 3 girls are not sisters, just 2 of them.)  I made fun of it, my friend made fun of it, I watched a few minutes then turned it off, then watched some more, finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it.  It has charm.  It IS a soap opera, but I thought it was well acted and well done.  It had humor, happiness, sadness, embarrassment (like the barrels of fish in the rich kid's car), love.  It had so much plot that it practically had none at all.  And I liked it.  But now, 15 minutes later, I'm beginning all over again to wonder why I bought it.  I could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick.  That man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all, no range, no depth, somehow he could carry a tune, but that's about the size of it, speaking of size, the size of his ego (which I assume is why he didn't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics) would have made a mushroom cloud!  I recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing.  For it's kind, I thought it was perfectly done.  I just like them a smidge more sophisticated.  The vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious.",1142121600,,1521,4.196551724137931
653166,4,6303433782,"It's hard to believe that this little 1988 film has endured  in popularity for so long.  It is a simple story of three 'sisters' in the small fishing village of Mystic, CT who have just graduated highschool, work as waitress in the town Mystic Pizza parlor, and face decisions about the future of their lives.  There are three less than fairytale romances with three  male characters of varying potential as partners and it is the 'coming of age' in a small Portuguese clan that sparks the tenderness and the sadness of this story written by Amy Holden Jones and directed by Donald Petrie.

One of the most interesting aspects of this low budget film is how it catapulted Julia Roberts and Matt Damon (who plays such a bit part he nearly goes unnoticed) to fame, reinforced the careers of fine character actors Conchata Ferrell, Lili Taylor and Vincent D'Onofrio while pushing the then promising Annabeth Gish, William R. Moses and Adam Storke over into TV land roles.

The film is a bit of nostalgia for a better time, has charm and innocence, and will always be one of those movies everyone who is a film collector will keep in their library for times when a return to simple little movies just makes you feel good.

653169,4,6303433782,"This movie was a movie that was a low-budget movie that became a surprise hit.  Following this movie, this movie would be responsible for two things:  1) Launching the career of actress Julia Roberts; 2) Making the restaurant ""Mystic Pizza"" a major tourist attraction in the tourist community of Mystic, Connecticut.  This is a movie that is entertaining and one that is worth checking out.

""Mystic Pizza"" is the story of three young 20ish women who work as waitresses at the ""Mystic Pizza"" restaurant:  Daisy (played by Julia Roberts) is ""the wild girl"" who plays a character of Portuguese descent;  Kat (played by Annabeth Gish) is Daisy's studious sister who is preparing to go attend Yale University next semester;  and their mutual friend Jojo (played by Lili Taylor).  In reality, Mystic Pizza has three stories that are rolled up into one movie.  The movie follows the romantic trials and tribulations of each of the women.  As the three women get involved in the trials and tribulations of their romance, the women will look to each other for support while at the same time dealing with friction among each other.  Here is a summary of the three storylines:

* For Daisy, we follow her romance with a rich preppy law school dropout named Charlie.  In Daisy's romance, the natural differences in background and income are going to cause some friction in the relationship.

* For Kat, while taking another job as a babysitter to save money for Yale, she meets Tim Travers (played by William R. Moses) and his daughter Phoebe.  Tim needs to hire a babysitter while his wife is away overseas.  Kat soon not only bonds with Phoebe, but finds herself attracted to Tim (and vice versa).

* For Jojo, she plays a woman who stands up her fisherman fianc Bill at the alter, but continues to date him.  While Jojo continues to have doubts about getting married, Bill is pushing for a wedding - thus causing friction between the two.

As for the movie, no doubt the standout performance is going to be delivered by Roberts.  Roberts' portrayal of the wild and sassy Daisy is right on the money.  While I wouldn't categorize this as an Oscar Award worthy performance, this is still a solid and very believable performance.  Roberts demonstrated some outstanding screen presence and seemed to have command of every scene.  Unfortunately, there weren't really any other standout performances in this movie - with the exception of Leona (who runs Mystic Pizza) who provides some light moments in the movie.  This probably allowed Roberts' character of Daisy to emerge as the Movie's central character.  The one thing that surprised me is that Roberts did not have top billing in this movie (that belonged to Annabeth Gish), however it is possible that the billings of the three girls were in alphabetical order (Gish, Roberts, and Taylor). As for other characters, it is worth noting that (a very young) Matt Damon has a minor role in this movie.  I also like the character of Bill.  Bill's desire to be the one to get married is something that isn't seen in male characters.

Another interesting part to the movie revolves around the workplace at Mystic Pizza.  One thing that I really enjoyed was not only how Daisy, Kat, and Jojo bonded with each other - but how they bonded with Leona.  You can see that while Daisy and Kat are sisters, they definitely consider their friend Jojo an extended member of the family - and Leona almost like a mother-like figure (even though the girls each have mothers).  The feeling is mutual too as Leona really loves the three girls.  A lot of times (in real life) we get close to co-workers and while Mystic Pizza may exaggerate this, I enjoyed seeing this reflected in the movie.  It is also worth noting there is a minor storyline involving Leona and the Mystic Pizza restaurant itself.

There is a terrific ""sing along"" scene in the movie in which the three girls have a bit of a wild night out in a pickup truck singing Aretha Franklin's ""Respect"".

Another thing that is outstanding is the early autumn setting in the New England town of Mystic, Connecticut.  Mystic is a beautiful town and it provides a perfect backdrop to the story.  I enjoyed many of the homes that were used in the movie - and it provided a nice element of realism.  While summer may be the tourist season in Mystic, autumn is the most beautiful time there.  The movie does a nice job at integrating ""off season"" into the Pizza business.

The movie does have some weak points though.  I really enjoyed the fact that three parallel stories were taking place in the movie.  The bad part is I feel the stories don't go as deep as I would have liked.  For Daisy's romance with Charlie, I would have liked to have seen more interaction with Daisy and Charlie's rich family.  As for Kat's affair with Tim Travers, it almost feels like that the ""tip of the iceberg"" is touched with this story, but it doesn't seem to go any further.  It is only Jojo's relationship with Bill that seems to go as far as it can go.  The bad part is that the Jojo storyline is probably the weakest of the three.

Despite some of the weak points, I still enjoyed watching this movie.  While this movie wraps up the storylines nicely, I almost felt that this movie could have easily warranted having a sequel because it would have been very interesting to see what happens to the girls several years later.  Overall, even if you just end up watching this to see an early career performance by Julia Roberts, you probably aren't going to be disappointed with the end product.  This is a movie worth checking out.",1125792000,3,5590,4.6656441717791415
653170,4,6303433782,"Mystic Pizza is a sisterhood coming of age story set in Mystic, Connecticut.  Annabeth Gish and Julia Roberts play sisters Kat and Daisy and Lili Taylor plays Jo - all daughters of Portuguese fishing families in the New England village.

The three have very different personalities, but they are also loyal to one another and their friends and families, and the strength of the film are the relationships.  The film opens with a horrid cliche as Jo backs out at the altar with friends and guests in tuxedoed attendance - she's afraid that marriage will hurt the sex life between she and Vincent D'Onofrio's Bill.  Kat is the brainy one - en route to study astronomy at Yale, she spends her last summer babysitting for William Moses' Tim - a man who seems nice enough, but doesn't hesitate to flirt and more with the babysitter while his wife is away traveling.  Julie Roberts blows away the screen as Kat's older sister Daisy, who doesn't have Ivy League Intelligence, but has world-class legs and a desire to rise above her fishing-class culture.  Early on she meets preppy Charles Gordon Windsor, Jr., played by Adam Storke. Charlie has been kicked out of law school and struggles between his contempt for his nouveau riche family and his own inability to measure up.  Daisy is wary that Charles is slumming as he comes onto her, but she's willing to risk a little.  Look for young Matt Damon in his film debut as Charles' brother, Steamer, in the scene around the family dinner table.

Conchita Ferrell is Leona, who owns and runs Mystic Pizza, a small pizza joint with a special pizza sauce that has been handed down for generations.  Kat, Jo and Daisy are all surrogate daughters as Leona's waitresses.

Kat falls in love with a married man and loses big time (so much for brains), Daisy meets a rich-boy college flunky and looks like she's going to win, and JoJo finally resigns herself and says ""yes."" It's a wonderful little movie about three character types and their interaction as friends (they all work at a local pizza joint), their foibles and their support for each other.

653172,4,6303433782,"Mystic pizza is the story of three young women who work at a pizza parlor in the town of Mystic, Connecticut and the struggles that they face in their lives.  Each woman has a unique relationship with their boyfriends and they all face different problems throughout the course of the movie.

Couple number one is JoJo (Lili Taylor) and Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio).  Bill is in love with Jo, but he wants a commitment from her, while Jo just prefers to keep their relationship simple and have fun at the same time.  The beginning of the movie shows Jo walking down the aisle at her wedding, but she chickens out in the end.  Will Jo ever agree to commit to Bill?

Couple number two is Daisy (Julia Roberts) and Charlie (Adam Storke).  Daisy is a free spirit, while Charlie is a law student.  The two couldn't be more opposite, but there is an attraction between the two.  Daisy tries hard to fit in to Charlie's upper class lifestyle, but she feels that Charlie is using her to get back at his overbearing father.  Will their relationship survive?

The final couple is Kat (Annabeth Gish) and Tim (William R. Moses).  Kat is a very intelligent girl who is heading off to Yale in the Spring.  Along the way, she answers an ad for a babysitter.  Tim is a Yale alum himself, and he needs help caring for his young daughter Phoebe while his wife is in London.  As the movie goes along, Tim and Kat's relationship becomes much more than father/babysitter.  Just as Kat is really beginning to fall for Tim, His wife Nikki returns from London, breaking Kat's hopes of a fairytale ending with Tim and Phoebe.  Will Kat be able to go on after this traumatic relationship?

I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The three storylines are skillfully interwoven together to produce a movie that is both fun and poignant at the same time.  There are some funny parts to the film, such as Daisy filling Charlie's expensive Porsche with fish guts as well as some touching moments, such as Daisy softly holding a distraught Kat after Nikki comes back to Tim.  I recommend this movie very highly.  The story is well conceived, and the parts blend together extremely well.

They partied and danced, laughed and played tricks on each other and the guys they were involved with. Robert's character had alot of bravado and spirit. Taylor's was cute and funny, sweet and without anger. Gish's was sensitive and smart. She held back more when the other 2 partied or got crazy. I loved the town of Mystic, Ct. You know there really is a Mystic Pizza. I looked it up and they really have good pizza. It can be ordered frozen through air mail and some stores actually sell it in the eastern states. It sounds absolutely wonderful. My favorite would be the Seafood Delight, with clams and scallops. They even vouch to have the mysterious sauce. The film was based on this tiny restaurant. It has expanded and there are now two. I would like to go to Mystic, it seems like such a neat place to visit.

All of the women in this movie are living proof of that, especially Annabeth Gish, who went from being merely girl-next-door pretty in Mystic Pizza, to the mature goddess we have seen on the X-Files.
Mystic Pizza is very much an ensemble movie, with no one person standing out above the rest. A very strong female cast is counterpointed by some solid male performances, such as that of the always superb Vince D'Onofrio - also check out The Cell, with Jennifer Lopez.
Beautifully filmed in Conn. New England, the movie is also a visual delight, and captures the reassuring simplicity of life in an Atlantic fishing community. I love Nova Scotia and Maine for the same reason. The original Mystic Pizza restaurant is still going strong and their website is well worth a visit.
All in all, a very sweet movie about real people and real family situations, and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I literally never tire of this modern classic. My only quibble is that the last spoken line is disturbingly unimaginative and anti-climactic. After crafting such a superb screenplay, the writers just seemed to run out of inspiration at the last hurdle. As Mr. Spock would say, ""Fascinating.""",1052956800,5,1340,4.755364806866953
653227,4,6303433782,"1988s Mystic Pizza is an enjoyable film about three young Portuguese women who work at a pizzeria in the fishing/resort town of Mystic, CT.  Julia Roberts stars as Daisy, a headstrong girl whose fast and loose behavior has not endeared her to her mother.  Annabeth Gish plays her younger sister Kat, whose is the opposite of Daisy.  She is quiet, brainy and is going to Yale to study astronomy.  Lili Taylor plays Jojo who is the girls best friend.  She has a quirky and carefree disposition and at the beginning of the film leaves her fianc, Bill, played by the underrated Vincent DOnofrio, who is a local fisherman at the alter.  The movie centers around the girls place of employment, Mystic Pizza, which is run by the gruff, but caring Leona (Conchata Ferrell) whose pizza is famously regarded and guards the secret to her sauce with a zealots devotion.  Both Daisy and Kat fall for guys during the summer, Daisy with a lazy, knockabout trust fund kid Charlie (Adam Storke) and Kat with Tim Travers, a wealthy architect whom Kat is babysitting his daughter Phoebe.  The movie is basically a predictable romantic comedy, but the actors are so likeable, that youll find yourself being caught up in their stories and director Donald Petrie perfectly captures the beautiful southern Connecticut coast (the film was shot in Mystic as well as other Connecticut towns and Rhode Island).  This film marked the first starring role for Julia Roberts and while it didn't catapult her to immediate stardom it set the blueprint for the type of role that would make her into the most popular actress in Hollywood.  The film is also notable as it marks the film debut of Matt Damon who has a blink and you miss part as the ridiculously named Steamer who is Charlies brother and appears in a scene at a dinner with Daisy meeting Charlies family for the first time.",1046390400,5,1852,4.72360248447205

Some can relate to Kat (Anabelle Gish) who is the 'smart sister' with a crush on a more sophisticated man as opposed to fisherman like Bill.  Some can relate to Daisy (Julia Roberts), 'The gorgeous sister' who is going no where but the back of sports cars.  Others can relate to JoJo (Lili Taylor), a girl who's only way to show love is through sex.  I think a lot of guys can relate to the male charecters also, like Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio), a man in love with a woman who won't commit or Charlie, (Adam Storke) a token rich boy who uses anything he can to get back at his father (including Daisy), and then there is Tim (William R. Moses) a gutless, cheating, liar.  But despite thier different personalities the girls are all held together by love, Leona, and Mystic Pizza.
  The chemistry between Lili Taylor (JoJo) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Bill) made their charecters very believable as compared to William Moses (Tim) and Annabelle Gish (Kat).  Julia Roberts was amazing on her own, she always is, but Lili Taylor was outstanding.",1046044800,,1151,4.691542288557214

Lili Taylor walks down the aisle with her future husband but has cold feet at the last minute.  Annabeth Gish, college bound, earns extra money babysitting and doesn't expect to fall in love with the married father of the child she babysits for.  And Julia Roberts, then 21, with a yearning to rise above her prescribed life, falls in love with a wealthy Yale law student.
How it all plays out is predictable, with a laugh or two along the way.  The film barely held my attention as my interest in the romantic goings on was lukewarm.  More interesting to me though, was the social structure of the town, located near an upper class area and the sharply drawn differences between the two places.  One of the most memorable scenes is when some Yale college students come into a working class bar and invite Julia Roberts to join them in a game of pool.

Particularly interesting, though, is the reversal of classic sex-roles pioneered by Vincent D'Onofrio, when Bill, his character, declares to love-nymph Jo Jo (played by Lili Taylor)  ""I'm telling you that I love you... and all you love is my d***!""
It's three for one in the love-tryst column, with the action shifting nubilely from each of the sister's separate but inextricably linked soap-operas.  The continuity of the three stories admittedly works, but no box of tissues needed.  Oh, and you guys make sure you're comfortable, in case you fall asleep.

Julia Roberts shines in her starring role, and (don't blink!) you can catch an early Matt Damon appearance. There are some strong supporting performances, especially the heart-of-gold restaurant owner (who uses special spices from Portugal in her secret pizza recipe), and the fus-fop food critic who pays them a visit.
The movie is dated in some respects: a yuppie couple drive a Volvo station wagon but load their four-year-old daughter on her mother's lap in the front seat instead of belting her safely in the back. Yes, this may be to show us the unity of their family and its affect on one of the three waitresses, but it also seems to demonstrate a misguided casual approach to child safety which I doubt would be filmed today. This couple, both Yalies, are 30 years old, married with a four-year-old, a scenario which although plausible is far less likely in 2002 due to much later marriages.

While both of the other girls seem to have something to live for (Jo-Jo has Bill, and Kat has her future career at Yale studying Astronomy), Daisy, as she points out in a rather touching scene, only has her six-pack of beer and her smile.

But what keeps the friendship going between the 3 young women? The not being able to identify the exact ingredients that make up the friendships, (like the Mystic Pizza secret recipes), makes the movie more fun but also entices more hunger for viewers - eating a pizza with secret ingredients is more filling than absorbing a friendship that refuses to tell what went into its making. Daisy and Kat are sisters, but being sisters doesn't guarantee a friendship. The two fight like cats and dogs, but when it comes right down to it, the two do things that prove their love for one another. Where did JoJo come from?

JoJo gives and gets support from the sisters, as well, but her ""story"" has the most satisfying ending, whereas the sisters are still unsure of their futures.

This is great movie with a great cast, the only thing I don't like about the DVD is it doesn't have the original cover/poster that has most of the cast on it. I think it's a better cover because this isn't just a Julia movie, and I know she would say the same.
Julia stars as Daisy, a girl who's never been able to live up to her mothers expectations so she only lives for herself, and is happy with it, until a rich young boy named Charles shows up at the local pool hall. He instantly falls for her, but Daisy is afraid that he is just using her to get back at his snobbish parents. ""Bring home your poor Portuguese girlfriend, shake up the family a little bit."" But Charlie isn't like that, and it isn't until Daisy discovers more about herself that she realizes this. Then there's her younger sister Kat(Annabeth Gish), whom her mother is so proud of because she will be attending Yale. Kat has never been in love and ends up falling for the married father of the young girl she babysits for; in this short time she gets to expierience the joys of love and the pain of being heartbroken when his wife returns.
Their friend Jo (Lili Taylor) is another story altogether. She loves her boyfriend Bill (Vincent Denofrio), a local fisherman, but every time she tries to walk down the isle she pictures herself fat and ugly with all these kids hanging around and ends up passing out.
In the end they all pass major milestones that come with life, and the movie ends with the girls looking into the stars. This wasn't a starting point for Annabeth Gish whom had already appeared in many movies, but was a bit of a launching pad for Julia who dyed her hair black with mouse just to audition for the role (and walked home in the rain ruining her blouse). This was only her third feature film, and she seems to grow in this role. It's no surprise she received an Oscar nomination for her next role in ""Steel Magnolias.""
Since Matt Damon has become a household name, I've seen this movie mentioned some places as starring him as well as the main actors, but I must advise that if you're renting it JUST for Matt, you're in for a big disappointment. Matt is only in one scene and only utters the lines ""Mom, do you want my green stuff."" So, it really isn't HIS film, but he is in it.
What makes the DVD special is being able to see the film's actual trailer and watch the movie in widescreen.

There was a pizza place near our house but it was nowhere near as elegant.  But the charecter of the proprietess in the movie rings absolutely true to the woman I knew as a kid.

On the surface is just a simple story about two sisters Daisy (Julia Roberts) the wild child, Kat (Annabeth GIsh) the straight A-student going to Yale on a scholarship, and their friend Jojo (Lili Taylor) a tiny whirlwind of a girl in love with a Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio) she just cant decide to marry
The three young women work as waitresses at Mystic Pizza under the watchful eye of Leona (Conchata Ferrell) the owner, whose pizza is legendary for its secret family recipe. Along the way they live life with each other, their families and their love interests which causes more than a couple of hiccups in the process.
Daisy and Kat's relationship is not an easy one, since they are so very different, but their sisterly bond gets tested when innocent Kat gets a part-time job as a babysitter for Tim (William R. Moses), an architect who has just moved into town and whom she befriends a little too close while his wife is in London for business.
When Kat gets a hard reality check once Tim's wife comes back home unexpectedly, shattering Kat's illusions about her relationship with him, Daisy feels moved to console her sister in her hour of heartbreak.
As the movie progresses Daisy meets a suitor of her own, a rich kid name Charlie Windsor Jr. (Adam Storke) whom she starts a relationship with, despite the fact they are from different parts of town.
After an awkward dinner at his family's house and a whole barrel of fish dumped on his Porsche by Daisy in front of a country club when she thinks he is cheating on her, they break up only to be reunited by chocolate ice cream and a maybe by the end of the movie.
Jojo finally gets married to Bill making everybody happy, Leona gets raving reviews on her pizza from a well-known food critic who makes a surprise appearance at the pizza parlor, Kat gets money for Yale from Leona who gives her a check when she destroys the one Tim gives her as an apology for what happened between them and in a cute little scene at the end while the three of them wonder about the future Jojo asks ""What the hell do you think Leona really puts in that pizza?"" Classic!!
If you haven't seen ""Mystic Pizza"" please do, you will enjoy it if only for the wonderful performances of the three lead characters, and for you who have already seen it, maybe several times as I have, revisit this wonderful cinematic gem. It's definitely good for the soul.
