7950543,1,B00005QFFY,Bought the movie because of an actress. The actress had one line. Movie was STUPID! Was a waste of money!,1384992000,,105,4.3
7950544,3,B00005QFFY,"I have to admit that I am a little biased toward this movie because it was shot in and around my hometown. Brent Florence delivers with his first feature film, filling the roles of writer, director and actor with surprising prowess.

Despite it's very low budget, this movie is highly entertaining while providing a refreshing social commentary about power, control, hope, courage and responsibility.

The characters are well developed and work together seamlessly",1213056000,4,464,5.342465753424658
7950545,1,B00005QFFY,"The meaningless antiks of a bunche of retarded hillbillies are neither interesting nor funny.

The blurb on the backside states that this is a director to watch for. I suggest that ""out"" be inserted between ""watch"" and ""for"".",1171324800,2,225,4.921052631578948
7950546,5,B00005QFFY,"I am in this film. My name is Christian Leffler, I play Neil(NIHIL). Brent Florence, the writer/director of this film, originally titled SOLID ONES, understands storytelling, casting, and actors so well that the film works on multiple levels. For young filmakers it's a testament to the independent process. Shot on Hi-definition video and then processed to look like film it is a stepping stone in independant film making. Florence and his crew were brave in their journey and it shows through the film.  The comentary is going to enlighten you to the fun we had and the technical follies as well. It's a fun ride for, literally everyone, that I hope you will enjoy and share with your friends. Keep your mind open and keep supporting smaller films as these films will challenge you, taking risks the studios ar too afraid to take.",1010707200,9,832,4.818181818181818
