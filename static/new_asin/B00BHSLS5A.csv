8568708,5,B00BHSLS5A,"I want to start out by saying I hate to exercise, especially at a gym.  And it shows--I am in my late 40s and 70 lbs overweight with some back issues.  I am woefully out of shape, definitely uncoordinated--but I ordered this because every other form of exercise just bores me, leading me to lose interest really fast.  I love Indian culture and thought Doonya sounded fun.  I had low expectations, figuring I wouldn't be able to do the video because of my back.  Not so (though I was very careful and started out keeping the movements smaller). This is the first exercise dvd that I am loving.  Just like others have said--it is fun and even though I am huffing and puffing I am enjoying myself and feel good.  On the minus side, I could see how months of doing this would get boring because essentially you are doing segments leading up to just one dance.  Going back to buy the 2nd and 3rd DVDs so I keep on moving!",1479168000,,917,4.321637426900585
8568709,3,B00BHSLS5A,"The entire video is just learning the steps. There was only one song to dance to at the very end. It's probably worth it if you plan on buying the other videos that come after it, but if you're looking for a full workout this is not it.",1462320000,3,236,3.9375
8568710,5,B00BHSLS5A,I wan them to make more,1459123200,,23,3.0
8568711,5,B00BHSLS5A,I rented this twice..probably should buy it.  It's such a great intro into Bollywood Dancing!  You learn quickly and I love that they explain what the song is saying.,1436140800,2,166,4.689655172413793
8568712,4,B00BHSLS5A,"I can not tell you how happy I am with this workout tape. It is easy to do and a really good cardio workout. It really works you out.! I
recommend taking your time mastering this beginners level before moving on the the intermidiate level. The music and instructors are very enjoyable.",1400630400,3,285,4.5
8568713,5,B00BHSLS5A,"The music was wonderful, uuplifting and the insstructors beautiful. The final dance with the men was a great show, and shows what you can accomplish by continuing on with the exercises. Although we are in our early 80's, we can do it for awhile, but then we watch it a lot also. The performers are so graceful. Again the music really makes the video. We are giving the video to our grandaugherss, 15 and 18 to use in theidr dance classes and I'm sure they fwilllove it and move on to the other more advanced videos. Your instructions on the movements made it all come together, thanks",1392422400,5,584,4.4672897196261685
8568714,2,B00BHSLS5A,"Would not recommend. Disappointing to me. In my opinion , it is not much of a workout and I didn't like how it flowed. The girls were also too camera conscious.",1373587200,,160,4.193548387096774
8568715,5,B00BHSLS5A,I took the class in NYC and absolutely fell in love with the bollywood dance routines and music!  Doonya is jam-packed fun & helps me burn a gazillion calories!,1361232000,5,160,4.517241379310345
