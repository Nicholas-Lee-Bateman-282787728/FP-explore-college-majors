4209641,5,B003VKSUR6,"For those who haven't seen ""Visions of Puerto Rico"", you don't know what you're missing. This is a very hard to find dvd because it's no longer being made but if you do find one out there I suggest you purchase it. I have seen this dvd with family members at least a dozen times. And everytime I see it, I feel more puerto rican then ever. This dvd shows you Puerto Rico like you've never seen it before. They mount a high definition camera to the bottom of a helicopter and you get to see all the beautiful scenery along with some great spanish music. This dvd gives you the option of hearing it in spanish (narrated by the great Rita Moreno) or in english. Either way, it's an awesome dvd that will trigger lots of laughs, stories, and endless conversations with your family members or visitors. It also gives you a wealth of information about the beautiful island along with the history of it's many cities. If you're lucky enough to find it, buy it!",1379548800,11,953,4.389830508474576
4209642,5,B003VKSUR6,"I thought it was a DVD instead of a VHS tape ,it was otherwise very good . I screwed up by not noticing that it was marked VHS and that's why I'm a 100 % satisfied .",1345161600,,165,3.4864864864864864

4209662,5,B003VKSUR6,"Bought it to get a preview of our upcoming river cruise.  It is beautifully filmed and does cover most of what we will be seeing, but not all.  I should have realized that an hour-long format will provide no more than a cursory overview--so my mistake.  Nonetheless, it is a nice ride down one of the world's most important waterways.",1426204800,3,334,4.533333333333333

It gives an aerial view of the many places we saw from the ship or on our daily tours.  The narrator has a wonderfully soft voice that so embodies the relaxed feeling we had on our cruises.",1423353600,3,327,4.433333333333334

8406878,4,B003VKSUR6,"This hour-long PBS program takes us on a tour of Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory since 1898) using aerial photography to swoop along the stunning coastline and survey the old fortresses and classic beaches. Moving inland, the camera lingers over the Spanish-influenced architecture and vast countryside, farms and forests. The sunny streets of Old San Juan come alive as we see children playing and people going about their daily lives. Lighthouses at each of the four points of the island anchor the travelogue, and along the way bits of history about the land and the people are accompanied by lively Spanish music. The editing is relaxed, in keeping with the islands rhythms, though a sense is felt of the encroachment of modern skyscrapers on its natural beauty. While lush forests and stretches of green countryside are hovered over, one cant help but ruminate upon the devastating effects of 2017s Hurricane Maria that flooded so many of the peaceful streets and plazas, after this program was made. Recommended for ages 12 to 18 as well as adults and give it 4 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Mike F., KIDS FIRST! Juror",1509580800,,1120,4.869109947643979
8406879,4,B003VKSUR6,"This is a nice video for someone who hasn't been to Germany already. The scenes are nice as the viewer soars over treetops and buildings in some of the historic and quaint small towns.  For those who have already been to Germany, maybe this isn't the best travelogue video, since there are no interior shots or interviews with local people. All scenes are shot from the air, my guess is they used drones. Nicely done though, and enjoyable to watch.",1494892800,,448,4.6
