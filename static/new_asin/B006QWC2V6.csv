5014434,3,B006QWC2V6,"My son had to read the book Jeremy Fink & the Meaning of Life over the summer for school,( Middle school )  My wife and I both read the book too.  We all thought it was a great book so we where very happy to find that they had made it into a movie.  We were all disappointed to see that they changed a lot of the characters ( they made them over the top strange )  and some of the story line.  It is not a bad movie if you have never read the book which I would highly recommend you your child read together.

  Jeremy Fink & the Meaning of Life is about a 12 year old boy who get's a box in the mail from his father ( who died in a car accident 5 years ago) one month before his 13th birthday. Jeremy and his best friend Lizzy  set off on and adventure to find the four keys he needs to open the box.  Jeremy meets some interesting people along the way and learns a lot about himself and what life has to offer.",1381968000,,912,3.8031914893617023
5014435,4,B006QWC2V6,"The movie wasn't quite as deep as the book, but it was fun.  I'm surprised that this didn't get more attention when it was released.  Unfortunately, all movies seem to require major special effects and earth change consequences these days.  Small movies like this get passed over.",1377993600,,280,4.914893617021277
5014436,5,B006QWC2V6,"The key on the boy's time machine is the key.  Spoiler alert, maybe, but I did not see that coming.  Wonderful
coming-of-age movie, when boys and girls consider the other has cooties.  Friendships developing where
none are expected. Taking risks in life to enrich it.  These things inspire me and I am long past these kids's ages.
Plus I like happy endings, though life does not always have them, one can always hope, which is what this
movie teaches.",1367193600,3,451,4.670886075949367
5014437,5,B006QWC2V6,I bought this movie for my Daughter and watched it with her. It has a great way of telling a story and incorporating values and meaning into entertainment at the same time.,1366156800,4,172,4.40625
5014438,5,B006QWC2V6,"My daughter had just finished this book by Wendy Mass so I treated her to the movie. We all watched it for a family movie night with a 12yo and 10yo. We all liked it, even dad. My daughter said the book was a little different with more details about the relationships but she enjoyed both.",1359244800,,289,4.178571428571429
5014439,5,B006QWC2V6,"Jeremy Fink is the son of a man who died when he was forty. Not only that, he had always known he was going to die when he was forty because a fortune teller told him so. His best friend is a girl who lives next door to him. Her mother left her and her father when she was a young girl. They live in New York and that is the start of the movie.

Since his father's death Jeremy has seen no reason to go beyond the area that he can walk, about two city blocks. He doesn't ride the subway or take taxis. He works on a time machine and he is constantly thinking about that moment that his dad was hit by a car while crossing the street. His best friend on the other hand is wild, brave, and willing to push Jeremy into doing more than he feels he can do.

For his thirteenth birthday Jeremy got a box with no key. A box with something special in it from his father. And from that moment on the adventure is on. His best friend and him go to an attorney's office and 'break in'. When they are caught they are given community service. The community service consists of them returning items sold many years ago back to the original owner. And each person the bring something to has an amazing story to tell about the item, their life, or their dreams.

The end is something that even I didn't put together until about the time Jeremy clicked onto the twist in the plot.

This is an absolutely lovely story and a funky movie. The characters are funky and loveable and enjoyable and move the story along in a positive manner. The theme of the movie is absolutely about the meaning of life and in some ways it's bigger than that too. It's an enjoyable movie and I'm glad I watched it with my sons.

Well worth the money.
Enjoy.",1349568000,8,1718,4.147147147147147
5014440,5,B006QWC2V6,"I wish I had my niece (9) and oldest nephew (7) with me when I saw this movie, they'd be acting it out in their backyard now.  The director understands kids and shoots them well.  Michael Urie,(from Ugly Betty) in my opinion, steals this flick!  It is a fun, family friendly film, filled with mystery and tender moments. I haven't read the book, so I can't compare, but sometimes it's fun to dive in head first!",1337472000,2,411,4.381578947368421
5014441,4,B006QWC2V6,"We watched the DVD with our daughters (8 and 10), who liked the movie and the story, but at some times had trouble following it. The topic of the meaning of life seemed a little over there heads. Other than that, they (and we) had a good time - they liked both the boy and the girl in the movie very much. We might watch it again in two year's time!",1335744000,5,349,3.9295774647887325
5014442,4,B006QWC2V6,Very enjoyable movie with a great message,1437868800,,41,5.0
5014443,4,B006QWC2V6,"Jeremy Fink & the Meaning of Life is a pretty good kids movie.  And that's exactly what it is- a kids movie, entirely from beginning to end.  Not even recommended for teens and especially adults.  I haven't watched a quality kids movie in years so it was nice to see one tonight.

It's about two kids (Ryan Simpkins and Maxwell Beer) who extensively travel the streets of New York looking in search of answers and keys pertaining to a mysterious box that is now in the possession of the kids.  The box is related to Maxwell's dad who died 5 years prior.  The two kids travel everywhere and even get into trouble on a few occasions.  However there's a pretty big twist at the end of the film that caught even me by surprise.  Maybe I'm just out of touch with the way kids films flow nowadays, but I didn't see that twist coming.

The acting is really stellar considering we're dealing with very young teenagers as the main characters.  I especially think highly of Ryan Simpkins character.  She's the one who motivates Maxwell to try harder on their quest to find all the box keys whenever Maxwell feels low and wants to give up.  Her character is instantly memorable because she has that witty, sarcastic and determined way about her demeanor that entices not only Maxwell but the viewers (you and me) to keep watching.  She's definitely a smart cookie for her age.

Maxwell, well he's just a reserved, pleasant and polite kid.  He often talks to his mother during the more emotional segments.  Maxwell's just her little monkey!  Sorry couldn't resist.  I like how the movie takes advantage of travelling to meet an assortment of different people and locations.  Everywhere from apartment buildings to fortune tellers to the police station even... unintentionally!  Some of the people are fruitcakes and the kids are able to detect and eliminate the oddballs immediately which leads to a few funny parts.  Also the limousine driver who takes the two kids around town gradually becomes perhaps the 3rd most popular character in the film.  I do wonder why the time machine part of the story wasn't fully developed.  It sort of got going towards the middle upon meeting a scientist then abruptly ended.

Overall quality acting, decent storyline and a nice movie for kids.",1422576000,,2268,4.741687979539642
5014444,4,B006QWC2V6,"One of those films that catches you off-guard. Love that as a cinephile.

Starts off quite modestly. With young actors you never know how things are going to turn - and to be quite honest, the opening scenes with Maxwell Beer and Ryan Simkins were wooden and uneven in places.

Not certain why, but their performances improved as the film went on; leading me to believe Director Tamar Halpern shot the film in chronological sequence, allowing the performers a chance to get used to the cameras and comfortable in their adoptive skins.

By the end of the film - I found the pair very endearing.

Essentially a fairy tale filled with the usual cast of surreal and oddball characters - young Jeremy Fink is celebrating his 13th Birthday. It's a special day since he believes that, as a newly minted Teenager, his life will change.

He's right.

However, it's also a somber day, one among many other somber days. Jeremy lost his father to a car accident when he was eight years old. The last five years have been difficult. His loving mother is a free-spirited librarian who has done a great job as a single parent. But even she can see that her inquisitive, inventive, and introverted boy has suffered by the loss.

Jeremy's best friend in the world is Lizzy. Like him, she's lost a parent. In her case, her mother abandoned the family. But interestingly - unlike the shy boy next door - Lizzy is explosively outgoing, brave and wonderfully optimistic. The loss and pain had the reverse effect on her, focusing her outlook to always seek out the brightness in a world filled with dark. And she sees her life mission to get her BFF out his bedroom and into the world.

Like inverted mirror images, the two are about to be challenged with a mystery that will reveal the Secret To Life itself.

A law office, by way of Restricted Delivery, has sent a very unusual box to the birthday boy. It was posted by his late father's lawyer. His very specific instructions: Send a specific sealed package to his son on his thirteenth birthday. It's dated just prior to his death.

The accompanying letter tells him that The Answers To Everything are sealed within, but that only a special set of four keys will unlock those revelations. Tamper with it in any way - other than to use the keys - and the contents will be destroyed. Catch is - his dad didn't leave him the keys. Jeremy has to find them himself.

Adventure on.

Jeremy and Lizzy are suddenly following clues and exploring the city for the quad metal instruments of access.

A touching tale that embraces several keystones in a young person's life. Particularly addressing children who have lost a parent. Coming to terms with that loss, allowing oneself some happiness, and growing up knowing that Love is always surrounding you. That this was delivered in a mostly unsentimental vehicle was, again, very surprising.

Rare treat and a rare recommendation from this adult cinephile to families with children between say 7-14 years old. I suspect that any older and they might resent watching a film about someone ""less mature"" than themselves.

Personal Note:

- Could this have been a better film? Yes. Had the filmmakers given the pair more ominous threats and developed cleverer and more complex challenges, this might've have provided a much needed visceral engagement to balance the film out.

That said, I completely understand that this is a ""light"" movie and one intended to gently broach a very painful subject.",1416528000,,3466,4.740432612312812
5014445,3,B006QWC2V6,"definitely a young persons movie; entertaining and positive, bordering fantasy. kids will love it.",1411344000,,98,6.071428571428571
5014446,4,B006QWC2V6,this is a good movie that could have been great with a better producer and etc that would at least one peanut butter sandwich in the flick.....beer is a nice kid who probably should go back on broadway??,1396224000,,203,4.368421052631579
5014447,5,B006QWC2V6,I had read this book with my goddaughter a long time ago and was curious about how it would translate to the screen. It does! Both my goddaughter and I were drawn into the story as if we hadn't already read the book. The casting is ace and the visual storytelling is both whimsical and effective. A great tale well told.,1395705600,,320,4.262295081967213

5014449,5,B006QWC2V6,"This was a charming story suitable for middle grade students.  Although there are some big names in the film, it has an unconventional quirkiness of some of the best indie movies out there.  There is a hint of almost magical realism that made me long for an adventure in the city.",1395187200,,280,4.470588235294118
5014450,5,B006QWC2V6,"I was babysitting and wanted to steer the girls away from watching Honey and I suggested this one because I loved Mira Sorvino back in the day. I didn't expect the film to be so uplifting for me as an adult and the kids really likes it too. Will add it to my list of child-appropriate films that are actually enjoyable to watch, right along with The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Stand By Me and Annie.",1395187200,,404,4.328947368421052

8503368,1,B006QWC2V6,"If I could give it no stars, I would. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. An incredible disappointment after reading a fantastic book. They took some wonderful characters and made them act so stupid and ridiculous - especially the adults. I feel really bad for Wendy Mass fans.",1493942400,2,283,4.568627450980392
8503369,2,B006QWC2V6,"The subject seemed intriguing and neither of us had read the book. But the acting & directing? Hate to use the word but almost amateurish. Production values were good except costumes seemed pretentious. A librarian wearing that type of outfit for work? Maybe if she were a character in a story-time play. And the girl had more costumes than seen at a Cher concert!

Totally didn't get the Joe Pants Oswold (?) character. Honestly? We fast forwarded to the end for the reveal. And THAT took forever!

Perhaps the book has over-the-top characters and theses actors captured them less than perfectly. Had high hopes and was quite disappointed. Have seen Disney Channel sitcom offerings with better performances.",1468713600,,708,5.042735042735043
8503370,5,B006QWC2V6,"Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life is a movie about a boy who is about to turn thirteen who receives a mysterious box from his late father. The box supposedly contains the meaning of life, but it requires four keys to open it which Jeremy doesn't have. So begins the search with the help from various characters who do not always seem friendly toward Jeremy (played by Maxwell Beer in his introductory role). Assisting Jeremy in the search is his long-time friend Lizzy (played by Ryan Simpkins). Jeremy and Lizzy are both very likeable kids right from the start which makes the movie even more enjoyable. Jeremy and Lizzy live in Manhattan and Jeremy has never ventured outside the two-block radius of his home alone. So Lizzy is always pushing him out of his comfort zone as the two explore and have interesting and exciting adventures together. It is these adventures that end up teaching Jeremy a very important lesson about life. I have watched this movie three times so far, and each time it seems totally fresh and fun for me. I think this movie is as meaningful for adults as it is for kids. I definitely recommend it.",1467504000,,1127,4.611940298507463
