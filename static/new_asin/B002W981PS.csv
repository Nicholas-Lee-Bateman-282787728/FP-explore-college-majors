I was in for a treat when it showed up in the mail. I loved giant robot anime, since I was 4 years old. When I first saw Transformers in 1984 , but since then I've discovered a ton of other giant robot titles. In anime Gaogaigar being one of the best, so good it has a slang term. To describe the over the top levels, of an action  mecha series .The term is called GAR ,anyway you have to get this series. If you are a fan of mecha anime or anime in general, get this series!!!",1367193600,,644,3.8059701492537314
