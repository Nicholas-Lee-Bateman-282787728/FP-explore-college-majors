8213080,5,B000UEAT1G,"EuroTalk's Talk More series is the ONLY DVD of its kind. If you have basic exposure to Cantonese, then you will get more out of this dvd than coming to the language cold. My only complaint is the length. It is 70 minutes long, but most of that time is the quiz section that tests what you know.
 I would have preferred 100% visual/audio sentence building, but life isn't perfect.
 This DVD contains brief sentences (hello, how are you, can I order...) said in English, then in Cantonese by either a male or female speaker. As well as having the text onscreen to further help you understand what you are saying. It is well paced and very easy to understand. There are a few DVD's in this series for Cantonese, but from what I know, they are all way too short, and overpriced ($35-$45 ea)
If you can find it used, it is worth checking out.",1245628800,8,837,4.358974358974359
