8266899,5,B0017QMRF2,"Fans of the TV series get what they deserve in this bundle, and at a great savings off buying each season separately.

For those who may not be familiar with the series, Angela Lansbury plays Jessica Fletcher, an author who always seems to find herself in the thick of actual murder mysteries.  The plots are usually clever, and the show can be watched by the entire family (there's no gross violence or bloodshed, although keep in mind the subject is in fact murder).

If you like murder-mysteries as wholesome family entertainment, this series will do the trick.",1232496000,3,564,4.793814432989691
