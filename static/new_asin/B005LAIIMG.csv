4774823,3,B005LAIIMG,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this film, but ultimately found it to be a somewhat average and mildly entertaining work.  There was nothing particularly special about it.  And, unfortunately, all the better scenes are in the two-minute trailer, so there's nothing really surprising about it.  The storyline dealt more with investigating the medical/biological source of the ""zombie"" affliction than the zombies themselves.  The zombies, in fact, felt like a plot device to drive the investigative angle of the story - nothing more.  For that reason, I found the film a bit disappointing and would not be interested in seeing it again.  I'm not even sure that I would be all that excited about a sequel, which is 100 per cent certainty.  Overall, I'd call this a tepid entertainment.  You won't want your money back, but you may wonder if it was well spent.",1371859200,11,867,4.890410958904109
4774824,3,B005LAIIMG,"Dubbed the largest budget zombie flick of all time, there is much expectation surrounding ""World War Z"". Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to it in 2007 and has been working toward bringing it to the screen ever since. First of all, calling it the largest budget zombie flick of all time isn't really saying that much since zombie flicks are pretty much the territory of low or no budget filmmakers to begin with. Then you throw in Brad Pitt and put it into the middle of the summer blockbuster season and expectations go through the roof.

So, what should you expect? Well, sooner or later, the zombie genre is either going to infect the entire country or drown itself in over-saturation. There are 8 zombie movies slated to release in 2013 and there were 25 released in 2012; most of these are done by low or no budget filmmakers, but the number of zombie movies out there borders on the ridiculous. Lets also not forget the highly successful ""Walking Dead"" television show. ""World War Z"" is a step up in quality, but is it all it's cracked up to be?

Well just because it is part of the summer blockbuster season doesn't mean that it is chalk-full of action and events. It is a drama in its purest form. Many of the most action packed or awe-inspiring moments are revealed in the trailer and many of these trailer moments spoil some of the best surprises. Fortunately for ""WWZ"" though, its best moments aren't those heavy CG moments that are revealed in the trailer, but a simple scene where three lightly armed people have to navigate a building that is half infected or the moments that Gerry Lang (Brad Pitt) reveals that his true motivation is his wife and daughters.

Despite a couple of really coincidental moments that caused me to roll my eyes a bit (including a plane crash caused by Pitt's character and of course his seat is the only thing that survives the crash), ""World War Z"" is well written, fast-paced and well performed. To compare it to other zombie movies is like comparing Pepsi-Cola to a lemonade stand; both are good, but one has more money. To compare though, this zombie flick may focus less on the gore and blood than others and Brad Pitt is a tremendous actor that makes this zombie flick better just by his mere presence.

There's a catch to enjoying ""World War Z"" though; maybe two of them. First, you have to love zombie movies because it isn't anything more than that. Secondly, you have to lower your expectations. The movie isn't going to dazzle you in any way shape or form. ""WWZ"" is a human-interest story with the addition of really intense fast moving bloodthirsty zombies.",1371859200,4,2628,4.620985010706638
4774825,1,B005LAIIMG,"I saw it in the theater second day of it's release in 3D and -- being a Brad Pitt fan -- was absolutely horrified (and not in a good way) by this nonsense.

And yet I can't help noticing a lot of 5 star reviews -- almost as if it's being seeded by the studio -- for a movie that has no characters, none of the traditional zombie violence (there's a lot of shrieking and running, but nothing remotely approaching ""graphic"", and not a single head-shot, which is how you kill zombies... isn't it?), and a story that is just silly.

The camera does a lot of flash-panning and blurring, so it's almost impossible to tell what is happening -- which is probably for the best, because the director doesn't seem to have any interest in the story anyway.

Every sequence in this film, from the very beginning where Pitt and family have breakfast, devolves into a tedious clich.  The ""acting"" is pedestrian at best -- Pitt's two ""cute"" daughters are annoying enough that I actually found myself wishing they'd get eaten.  Every scene feels contrived and often like a cut-and-paste from another movie -- which I suspect most of them are.

The zombies are those high-speed dudes from 28 Days Later (now THAT is a zombie movie), and they make a lot of noise and shriek -- but someone decided to trim (or not even shoot) any kind of carnage, so while there are some spectacular crowd scenes (you've seen most of them in the trailer BTW) there isn't any visceral threat, little tension, and no horror to speak of.

The film makes the classic mistake that most Hollywood groupthink projects make: disrespecting the genre.  In ""Night of the Living Dead"" the dead rose and feasted on the living -- and no one wasted time trying to figure out why.  In ""28 Days Later"" a virus got loose, and the infected feasted on the flesh of the living -- and no one wondered why.  In Zac Snyder's silly remake of ""Dawn of The Dead"" one of the characters died, and then it was revealed that if you're not bitten you don't come back: so where did the first Zombie come from?  HINT: it didn't matter until the idiot screen-writer brought it up.

WWZ has Brad Pitt on a quest for Patient Zero (a la ""Contagion"" -- a great apocalyptic movie BTW) so they can do what?  Find a cure?  You turn Zombie TEN SECONDS!  Find a vaccine?  They BITE you!  It's like creating a vaccine for shark-bite!

By the time Pitt arrives at the final act you can anticipate the dialog word for word, and then it all turns into a Doom-like videogame.

But wait, maybe I was just jaded, with ridiculous expectations?  I felt so bad about feeling bad about this movie that I rented ""Mama"" just to see if I was having a bad day: ""Mama"" scared the pants off me.

WWZ?  Forget it!  This is the zombie movie you can take your parents to -- and then you can listen to them listen to them call you a wuss all the way home.",1371859200,42,2853,4.3719165085389
4774826,3,B005LAIIMG,"Clearly, the zombie pandemic is alive and well in the world of entertainment.  These creatures aren't just a new sensation, they've be relevant in film for quite some time now and depending on whom you ask, zombies originated in film at least as far back as the 1930s.  Regardless, zombie films have come a long way and evolved into a genre all its own, typically bordering on horror - but without a main protagonist to specifically lead the mayhem (unless you'd like to make a claim for George A. Romero).  With the recent success of the highly popular AMC drama, The Walking Dead, and the Resident Evil franchise, not to mention comedies like Warm Bodies and Zombieland - it would appear the undead are preparing to continue their reign of terror for quite some time.  And, you know zombies flicks are at the height of their popularity when Brad Pitt decides to sign on for a leading role.

Based on the novel of the same name by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace), World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator called back to action to investigate the origin of a ""zombie"" academic.  Originally reluctant to take the assignment, Gerry decides it's in the best interest to (reluctantly) leave his family and attempt to find a cure.  However, finding an origin or a cure becomes difficult when every major city in the world becomes devastated by zombie outbreaks - leaving Gerry with little options other than to keep moving from city to city.  Mireille Enos, Ludi Boeken, James Badge, and Fana Mokoena also star in supporting roles.

The film wastes little time, quickly turning to chaos on the streets of Philadelphia.  To be honest, the first half hour of the film feels like early episodes of The Walking Dead as we follow Gerry Lane, his wife, and their children, as they run from zombies on the street, through a building, and eventually face-off with them on a rooftop.  Essentially, that is what goes down in the first few episodes of The Walking Dead.  But, this isn't a Walking Dead comparison, and the fact that World War Z resembles a massively popular TV show is definitely not a bad way to start a film.  Zombie films should start off small, in a secluded area and then balloon from there - as the film does.

World War Z might just be the grandest (in terms of visual scale) zombie film ever made, with all major cities falling to an unknown disease that kills people and quickly reanimates them in death as flesh eaters.  Most zombie films don't take the time to provide a grand scale look at major cities, often simply focusing on one specific city and a small group of people trying to survive within it or at least escape from it.  This film takes Brad Pitt's character from one end of the earth to the other, beginning in Philadelphia and moving to South Korea, Jerusalem, and finally a health lab in Wales.  There's no shortage of travel, nor are there many scenes without a zombie trolling around.

You may have noticed from the synopsis or various advertisements that there is zero star power other than Brad Pitt.  This is - from beginning to end - a film dominated by Brad Pitt.  As he moves from one location to the other over the course of the film, he usually loses his supporting cast along the way (which shouldn't be too surprising).  Pitt portrays an observant character focused on the goal of finding answers, basically because he is blackmailed into it as a means to protect his family.  However, it is rather far-fetched to see the lengths army officers and other nations go to in order to protect him.  Evidently, Pitt's character really does mean a great deal to the survival of the human race - but that portion of the film is hardly understandable.  Far too many people lose their lives at the expense of allowing Pitt to move from one part of the globe to the other.  And, his character always manages to squeak his way out of danger.

If you didn't follow the film's production news (and most people don't), World War Z had quite a bit of footage needed after the completion of filming to fully explain the ending.  Even though the ending is relatively simple and climatically uneventful, it would have been much, much worse without the added footage (basically the final 45 minutes) to fully explain the film's ending.  Sadly (mainly due to the lack of bloodshed), the film simply goes through motions of coming to its simple conclusion.  There are virtually no scenes where you're on the edge of your seat and frankly, the film's final stanza lacks the appropriate amount of drama for a zombie flick.  For once, people actually act sensible when dealing with a group of zombies - which is admirable, yet still pretty boring.

As far as zombie movies go, World War Z isn't the best and it isn't the worst.  Still, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.  The film is so full of action that it almost doesn't feel like a full-blown zombie flick.  It's not you traditional film about people hiding out and spending a film looking for salvation.  This film is about one man's goal to protect his family by investigating a global crisis - which just happens to be zombies.  Overall, Brad Pitt does an admiral job fighting off the well-designed villains - all while indicating he might even be back for some sequels sooner than later.

The bottom line:  if you're a Brad Pitt lover, this might be an iffy choice.  It will depend on your devotion to him and whether or not you can handle a borderline horror flick.  However, if you're a lover of The Walking Dead or simply enjoy action-packed zombie movies (minus things constantly popping out at you in typical horror movie fashion) - this film is for you.  You certainly won't walk out of this film disappointed.  In fact, you'll walk out looking forward to a promising sequel.

4774827,4,B005LAIIMG,"We'll just got back from the premier of WWZ and thought it was a great movie.  I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars but Amazon does not give this option.

Descent plot, great action throughout and a good ending to save the World.  I think I would have preferred to have a different opening to it before Pitt and family got hit in Philadelphia.  They said the white house got taken down, Washington DC whipped out and the president killed so that probably would've made a better opening scene even though it would not show show Pitt in the opening scene.

I thought the director did a descent job as well.  I had read several times the ending was entirely reshot as the original was too complicated.

Their was a scene taken off our very own Walking Dead that will not be a surprise to many when you see it.

If you could label the movie something it would be like ""Dawn of the Dead"" zombies on speed though.  Swarming Hordes were very impressive on the big screen, but the majority of these scenes were displayed at least in segments on several of the trailors.

We'll I hope for a good unrated DVD  to follow, director cut etc....

I think most will come away saying it was a good movie but just didn't blow them away.  I think some of walking dead episodes could be labeled as blowing you away however.  So for the amount of money spent I think the crew got an extended vacation in several countries in the process and maybe bigger pay checks then they should have?

I do have to commend them on doing such a movie showing the lack of gore and blood.  This was a big plus and should show others it's not really needed as most movies portray it these days.

Go check it out!!",1371686400,3,1665,4.268370607028754
4774828,5,B005LAIIMG,"Vultures have been circling the lumbering mega-budget production of World War Z almost since the film went into pre-production. First, fans of Max Brook's highly-regarded novel were up in arms when it emerged that the book's multiplicity of survivors' tales was to be distilled into a star vehicle for Pitt. Then news leaked of multiple drafts from various writers being rejected (the film has writing credits for four different scribes). Early trailers were ill received. It emerged that the entire last act of the film (an epic battle sequence) had been junked and fanboy kryptonite Lindelof brought in to write an entirely new ending.

With the mood on the blogosphere toxic, the trades and mainstream press piled in as the smell of blood in the water grew stronger. Paramount eventually stopped even pretending the film was not troubled, allowing Vanity Fair to publish an astonishing account of the difficult production - further increasing speculation that this was a $200 million dollar plus vanity project for Pitt and his production company, Plan B.

Now World War Z has finally arrived,and if the narrative behind its making is as compelling as that of any of 2013's blockbusters, the unexpected twist ending is the year's most shocking. Spoiler... the movie is good. In fact, it's not just good - it's great.

Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former investigator for the United Nations living with his family in cheerfully chaotic domestic bliss, economically sketched out in an opening breakfast scene that is almost the only moment of calm for the next 100-odd minutes - save that the TV in the kitchen is running disturbing news footage of social disorder breaking out in locations across the world. Driving his family into the city, Gerry gets stuck in traffic gridlock and BOOM! All hell breaks loose as the whole world goes to s***in what seems like five minutes flat and director Forster slams the pedal to the metal for the first of many stunning action sequences.

The subsequent globe-trotting story has Lane is drafted back into service for the United Nations to search for the source of the ""zombie"" plague that within days has brought the world to the brink of apocalypse. The pace is blistering, honestly comparable to Gareth Evans' The Raid, and the scale is as epic as hundreds of millions of dollars can provide. What makes World War Z really work is humanity of its characters. Pitt himself is at the heart of this. To make a film like this commercially viable, it had to have a major star. But Lane is no superman (or Superman). He isn't James Bond, Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt - in fact, he spends most of the film running away from stuff. Pitt really sells the notion that Lane is a common man in extraordinarily uncommon circumstances, motivated by love of his family to put himself ridiculously in harm's way. I struggle to come up with another male star of his stature that could have pulled this part off.

Pitt is in every scene, but around him are a rapidly-changing collection of characters who join only for sections of the narrative. However by canny international casting characters who often have mere minutes of screen time register memorably. Especially good are Enos (from TV's Big Love and the US version of The Killing) as Lane's wife, and Israeli actress Daniella Kertesz (in a nearly dialogue free role). Nowhere is it more clear that the film has been substantially shaped in the editing room, than from the fact that the highly-billed Fox is essentially a blink-and-you'll-miss-him featured extra. Before remarking on Forster's skills remember that when Terrence Malick does this, he's called a genius.

Where the film really scores is that despite the fact that it is a ""zombie"" movie (and unusually one where the reason characters use that term is because they have seen zombie movies), the environments and human characters feel real and convincing. The action has a gritty verite feel while never being less than spectacular. While the threat is fantastical, like Romero's best zombie films World War Z takes place in a convincing world - in this case a distinctly post 9/11 one. One sequence in particular is sure to inspire debate over the presence or not of a geo-political subtext, but I'll leave that for you to discover.

World War Z is also often very frightening; despite the lack of gore, this is an extremely intense film and one which parents should be very careful about bringing children to. At the time of writing no BBFC certificate had been announced, but it has received a PG-13 in the US - meaning a 12A is quite possible. This is absolutely not a movie for under-12s, and if you take them, prepare for sleepless nights.

The breakneck pace and sheer shock-and-awe of the film's scale paper over a few cracks. What exactly makes Pitt's character the UN's go-to guy is never exactly made clear, and some of the plot mechanics that propel the story from one part of the globe to the next don't quite hold up to intense scrutiny. However, in my view, one would really have to be committed to not having a good time to find these elements overly troubling. This is widescreen filmmaking at its best.

World War Z is a compelling reminder that for every troubled production that produces a Bonfire of the Vanities or Island of Dr. Moreau, there is Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, or Blade Runner. I'm not putting WWZ quite in that category - only time will tell - but against all the odds, this is the best blockbuster yet seen in the 2013.",1371081600,,5496,4.807407407407408

4775557,4,B005LAIIMG,"I'm not a great fan of zombie flicks, but I sort of liked this one. Brad Pitt stars an UN-affiliated special investigator who is caught up in a zombie apocalypse of unknown provenance. The first part of the film feels like every other zombie apocalypse you've ever seen: suburbia turns into zombie sprawl, we have to get to the roof of that abandoned building, the military mysteriously makes it, etc. Things eventually get more interesting. The finale has suspense, drama and some original twists.

It's interesting to note that the zombies very quickly get de-humanized in this production. In other zombie films, it's a clich that some grandmother or other loved family member turns into a flesh-eating monster, and we're not supposed to forget that the undead are really us. Indeed, this is what makes zombies so scary to many people! In this story, the zombies don't really feel human at all, not even when you see humans turn. They remind me more of weird aliens or swarming insects: bizarre, dangerous, incomprehensiblebut not really evil in the strict sense. And definitely not us.

For whatever reason, I liked this approach better.

The politically correct aspects of the film feel forced. Sure, the UN deputy general secretary is African, but the real heroes are all White males (except an Israeli elite soldier  no surprise there), while the poor womyn and girlz sit at home, more worried about their man than the end of the world. Blaaah! It was rather funny to watch the scene where Israel (of all places) opens the Wall to Palestinians, only to be punished for its sudden peacenik conversion by murderous zombie invaders (or is it a metaphor for ISIS?). As usual, the US military turns out to be the saviors of the world

My problem isn't so much with these stereotypes, per se, but that Hollywood thinks they don't show if they tack on some token minorities. Pro-tip: either go all the way *or* stay with the usual tropes. Except for the zombie trope, which was given a necessary overhaul in this flick.

In the end, I give World War Z four stars.",1517011200,,2062,4.761904761904762

4775630,2,B005LAIIMG,"If you're into the zombie genre, stick to ""The Walking Dead"". This review will contain spoilers.
First of all, time. There is not enough time in a movie to develop a story like this and the end result just left me dissatisfied. The film ends just as the protagonists find a stop-gap solution that might give them the space to find a real solution to the zombie outbreak. It then proceeds into a corny montage with a voiceover as the ending. In the ""Walking Dead"", they found basically the same ""camouflage"" idea, I think in the first season and several seasons later, the story is still not resolved. This time gave the ""Walking Dead"" makers time to develop a story, unlike ""Z"". The whole film feels rushed and unfinished. As a pilot for a tv series, it might work, but not as a stand-alone film.
Second, it strains credulity too far. Some examples (spoilers ahead): somehow, Israel has managed to wall out the zombie attack and this fact has drawn the Brad Pitt character all the way from S. Korea to figure out...something. They vaguely seek patient zero but, of course, the 'only hope' doctor shoots himself as they disembark in Korea (he's not Brad Pitt, after all) but not before he tells Brad Pitt something that you just know will become a flashback later (it does). He gets there and on his tour, some Arabs and Jews are singing a middle-eastern rendition of kumbayah. Well, the zombies are attracted to sound and they are really singing it - peace in the middle east and all that. In a matter of seconds, Israel is overrun with zombies that wanted to join the singing. That's all it took.
So the 'heroes', after Brad Pitt uses a knife to lop off a female IDF member's hand with a casual flick of the wrist after she is bitten, flag down a departing commercial jet and escape. They need to get from Israel to Wales where there is a W.H.O. facility. Well, a zombie stowed away in the toilets and soon (again, seconds), half the passengers are zombies. Seconds later, Brad Pitt lobs a grenade and blows the side out of the jet and they crash, but no worry: they crashed in the exact place they were trying to go: Wales - walking distance from the W.H.O. Not only did they get there in seconds, but Brad Pitt and his IDF buddy are the only survivors of the crash. It seems the director wanted to develop some kind of bond between them but, again, time, and the other passengers - well, they're not Brad Pitt.
There, BP injects himself with one of the most deadly diseases known to man as his 'camouflage'. He makes it out past the zombies and in another montage, he gets a tiny injection that is supposed to cure him of this disease. I was once bitten by a dog and spent two days on IV antibiotics. It's just not believable.
And that's the whole story. Why so many spoilers? Because it's not worth watching for the story anyway. It's films like this that have turned me off of films altogether. I don't know how they used to do it. Films like ""Terminator 2"" managed to tell a coherent story complete with explosions and special effects in the length of a film. But it seems rare to find a story in a film nowadays, and that's why I look to TV if I want to watch something, and in this case, this film and ""The Walking Dead"" are the same story, one done well, one not.",1511481600,2,3272,4.400990099009901

4775974,4,B005LAIIMG,"When I first saw this film in 2013, I wondered why Brad Pitt's and Leonardo DiCaprio's production companies competed for the rights to Max Brooks' book. Aside from the title, only the slimmest of similarities remain. In fact, so little of Brooks' work remains that the film's location-by-location race and treasure hunt feel more like Dan Brown wrote the script.

The first half hour has one of the best intros of any zombie film, barring the highest in the genre (either Dawn of the Dead, 28 Weeks Later).

Pitt's charisma holds much of the film together. The settings range from collapsing Philadelphia to UN flotillas to South Korea, Israel and Wales. There's a lot going on here, and some carefully woven elements are spelled out later in the film through exposition for those who can't put it together. The aerial shots of smoking, ruined cities look great. The hive-like swarming zombies add a touch of originality in approach, even if the alleged source material favored slow, Romero-like undead.

Plot holes abound, but so what. It's a zombie film. One with bloated production values that make it look really good, as opposed to the 1-star efforts that look like student films and can be found gratis on your Prime queue. For instance, I can't imagine Israel would believe a single wall would keep the zombies at bay. All fortifications, back to those of the ancients, had layers of stand-off defense and ways to seal off portions of a castle-fort-compound that had been penetrated. No CWIS or Iron Storm guns or unmanned aerial vehicles or unmanned ground robotics or GMLRS ... I could go on. I won't. You get the point.

My only true issue with the movie is that, like a Dan Brown book or film, it dissolves like cotton candy after you're done enjoying it. It's all lead-up with a rushed conclusion, no doubt related to budget overruns and production issues that nearly tanked the release. Contrast with ""28 Weeks Later,"" an underappreciated sequel to ""28 Days Later"" that is painful to watch in its treatment of surprisingly well-developed characters.",1501545600,,2062,4.882857142857143

That said, they should have called this movie, ""World War Z-Z-Z-Z's"", as in 'Y-A-W-N'ss, starring Brad Pitt & a cast of nobodies!
To anyone who watches this film, you will only get your $$$'s worth from the opening scene & subsequent chaos in Philly. After that, the movie becomes boring,........ b-o-r-i-n-g,........... B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!
You keep getting introduced to emotionally flat, cardboard supporting characters so quickly, one after the other like going thru cheap suits lined & hung up in a dept store rack and then disappear just as fast- that the viewer is never given enough time to understand their purpose or have empathy for thus I found myself unable to root for them.
The zombies themselves are mainly background clutter & are never given any characterization or lengthy screen time to be considered really 'villainous' or scary.
Brad Pitt turns in yet another in a long line of his ""little boy lost expressions while implausibly coming up with cliched last sec ideas to escape or solutions to disasters"" performance, which he's made a career of. And considering he's the only 'credible actor' in this film, that ain't saying much.
If you're looking for similar zombie-themed flick only with some real suspense, I recommend you check out ""Train To Busan"" instead!

4776208,1,B005LAIIMG,"I honestly don't see what people like about this film.
I will break it down a bit more but to summarize it was a rather mediocre film and probably the lamest big budget zombie film I have ever seen.
Previously I could never get more than fifteen minutes into the film, after trying to watch it on several occasions, as I found utterly boring and canned. It really did nothing that practically every zombie movie made in the last twenty years hadn't already done.
Lately I have been reading the actually book which got me thinking of watching the film again, not finished with the book yet but I figured the film would be pretty different and boy was I right.

Cinematography -  was okay but tends to focus on things that I really don't care about in the story. The action was pretty over the top and completely unconvincing of a zombie apocalypse. Running zombies, okay that's the modern take on it, but flying ninja attack zombies that use their skulls as battering rams? That's just stupid really, hell they didn't even eat anyone just bit and ran which made no sense.

Characters and plot - dumb, one word says it all. I didn't care about anyone and the ones I did were brushed aside as inconsequential to the film. The main character is completely boring, he really doesn't involve me at all nor does the main story of the film.
Oh suddenly theres zombie outbreak everywhere, we had no idea, everyone dies, waaaah. The film completely loses any sense of probability and destroys the willing suspension of disbelief.

Compared to the novel - There really is no comparison, I'm not even finished with it and I can say the film was a waste of time. The book has a lot of great ideas and a plausible scenario (even if a few things are over the top) for the global spread and epidemic of the zombie virus. It relies on real world events and occurrences and uses a variety of locations and viewpoints to tell the tale in a way that makes it easy to suspend disbelief and feel engrossed in something that feels like it's relating a real tragedy. The film relies on hokey clichs and set pieces to try and tell a massive story that is fumbled before they even get started.
The book makes this event personal and relate-able, from the onset and patient zero to the fall of massive cities and military impotence it all feels more plausible. The film is B-movie grade story at it's best.

I think the biggest loss for the film was the lack of focus on the moral decisions that are prevalent in the book, it's very heavy on morality and survival decision making. From everyday people making hard decisions to world leaders making painful choices to save humanity, it all has impact and is delivered directly without declaring right or wrong decisively. The film hardly touches that with a ten foot pole, it is used as a short whip for the main character and nothing else, all of the drama of the original material is tossed aside for a forced bs drama of one family. And that is such a waste.

The source material is great, it feels like a real documentary of a horrible time for the world, and the film tosses everything out the window to make just another garbage cheesy modern zombie film.

Best suggestion is don't waste your time, read the book.",1489536000,6,3241,4.511073253833049
4776209,4,B005LAIIMG,"This is a very good movie.  The action starts almost immediately.  It is engaging, intense and smart.  The acting is very well done.  And it brings something new to a genre that is a bit over done.  To me Z transcends its genre.  The only thing that I would change (SPOILER ALERT) - is the plane scene.  Brad Pitt's character survives a great many things and you can buy most of it - but what happens at the end of the plane scene is just too far.

My criticisms of WWZ are there directed at the movie's problems in general not whether it adhered to some unstated rules for Zombie movies.

The movie is fast paced. Performances are all fine but the movie doesn't exactly demand great acting skills from its cast.

WWZ's problem is the plot which has gaping holes in it.

A grenade in an airplane not causing a total structural failure rather than a hole in the fuselage.
A zombie on the plane for hours without detection or violence
The inconsistencies in level of noise that wakes the zombies. Planes taking off or landing at an airport not drawing the zombie hordes.
That plane couldn't have gotten off the carrier and to South Korea from the Atlantic Ocean
How did that boy elude capture in the apartment house?
The Speakers in Jerusalem when it is known sound draws the zombies. BTW why didn't the planes in and out of the airport draw them? Planes taking off are extremely noisy.
Pitt telling the UN guy that he's on I-95 when it is obvious he isn't.
How did Pitt and his family get to New Jersey from Philadelphia? You have to cross the Delaware river and the RV was last seen driving parallel to the river and the bridges were clogged with traffic.
The daughter getting the rifle in the RV. What's this, Show & Tell?
The death of the epidemiologist was pointless.
A nuclear explosion not explained. The EMP knocked out Pitt's cellphone but it was again working later on.
The superathleticism of the zombies.
Two plane crash survivors, one impaled and the other a recent amputee, walk considerable distance.
A baseball bat rather than a cricket bat. Note to screenwriter- The scene was set in Wales.
I have other issues with the movie. WWZ isn't a good movie",1480118400,,1904,4.591176470588235

Oh your trying to reinvent the genre? Well you failed miserably.

PG-13? Please! Pure garbage. It started off well, but quickly De-evolved into an around the world treasure hunt for answers to the zombie plague, And the cheesy Hollywood ending? Give me a break. If you don't understand that these movies are supposed to be apocalyptic in nature, then sit down and make a kid's show. Zombie fans want zombie movies where people get torn to shreds, and bullets and axes tear through zombie brains. Absolutely none of that going on here.

In-Depth Review

The story starts out fairly simple, a father who has the choice to stay home, or continue with a job that keeps him away from his family. The story quickly takes off with the introduction of a plague spreading like wild fire, and our protagonist is summoned once again into his work field, using it to give his family a better chance at survival as the price for his services. From their, the story literally runs from one-action-packed scene to the next, and while the ending is not conclusive: there is hope for humanity.",1476403200,,728,4.816

I hate Brad Pitt but his performance in this one, was outstanding!

**Spoiler Alert**

There is a zombie outbreak - if you're bitten by a zombie, you do not have to die to turn - turning is almost immediate. Gerry is a retired UN Investigator and his wife, Karen and 2 kids, seek shelter from an old friend. They end up on a warship.

The hunt for patient ZERO is on (in the hope to find a cure). Gerry is blackmailed into going with the crew. If he does not, his family will be moved to the mainland - he agrees because of his family's safety. Things unfold and you just have to watch it to find out what happens next!!!

Brooks is a talented writer, and I felt the fear and panic and hopelessness of people under sudden attack when I read the book. The movie shows people running and screaming, and, suddenly, in their midst, we see...zombies. Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I might have enjoyed the movie more.

The story itself is significantly diminished by the oxymoronic concept of a ""family friendly"" Zombie movie and the ridiculous plot holes such as Israel's inability to recognize that loud sounds attracts the Zombies. The unrated version is superior to the theatrical release in that the additional intensity and gore offsets the ""choppiness"" and uneven aspects of the theatrical release. The only reason I didn't give WWZ 5 stars is because of the gaping plots holes and the screen time wasted on the unrealistic use of a SAT phone in the midst of a global crisis.",1474675200,,720,5.0588235294117645

SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen the movie do not read past this point!!!!

I really like how the zombies move as quickly as they do. It adds to the fear and fast paced world the characters live in. It also made it so realistic when even his wife and daughter were removed from the aircraft carrier because they were no longer valuable. The military needed to make space for people/resources they actually needed on the ship; I totally get that. The most interesting thing for me was that the zombies did not attack those who were sick or weak as come to find out later in the movie. I'm not sure if/when a sequel will ever come out but if it does, it would be great for them to really build on that fact.

It was a completely different story that was clearly written just to make a movie out of an idea. Nothing in the book pointed towards infecting yourself with a deadly virus as a form of zombie inoculation. They fought a war.. a hard war.. a war that took a huge toll on mankind. It was brought to us through first hand accounts gathered through many, many individual interviews.  There wasn't one central hero beating the odds and surviving hardship, only to come up with the answer to solve the zombie problem. It was a lot of people, making gut instinct decisions based on limited information and doing the best they could at that moment in time. It showed personal struggle, sacrifice and determination. This movie showed none of those things.

This was a decent story, but naming it after a book it didn't follow in any way was a mistake.",1472342400,8,1007,4.558011049723757

4778127,1,B005LAIIMG,"This is a really boring zombie movie. The problems start with trying to adapt a book that didn't really lend itself to being made into a film. The book is like a history after the fact of a worldwide zombie work. The film is basically about Brad Pitt's character. Pitt is some sort of UN doctor or official or something. Brad Pitt runs around, He frets about his family. He talks about the UN. zombies attack. repeat.

The film starts out with the usual zombie outbreak scene. Then they go to Korea for no particular reason which leads to a trip to Israel for no particular reason. They spend lots of time running around only to conclude that they can't know anything about the origins or cause of the zombie outbreak. Then, out of left field, Brad Pitt has a ""Eureka"" moment which makes no medical or scientific sense but that solves everything. Or at least everything until the sequel.

About every three minutes, Brad has to fret about his family. It gets really annoying really quickly. The ""twist"" on the zombie thing in this film is that the zombies are really fast. But its still the same old zombie stuff.

The plot is really thin and Brad Pitt is literally the only character that matters. If you want two hours of expensive zombie special effects, this is your film. But if your looking for anything else, there is nothing to be had.

The typical Resident Evil film had more plot and character development than this film.",1467331200,,1431,4.556420233463035

4778129,1,B005LAIIMG,"If there were negative stars, this movie would get them -- all five of them.  It is a fungus on the already putrified body of what passes for film in Hollywood. The  plot consists solely of  walking dead people biting hunks of flesh out of living people,  and then the living people turn the walking dead into bloody carcasses, presumably more dead than they were before.

The hero Brad Pitt thinks of a way to outwit the undead by making the healthy so sick that the undead won't eat them. What a perfect Hollywood-style solution....more sickness.

That's all there  is to the plot...and it gets four stars from thousands of viewers?  As a species we're doooooomed.

The most satisfying scene is one in which  thousands of zombies climb and leap over Israel's high protective wall to stream with much gnashing of teeth the Wailing Wall.  They chase a young female Israeli soldier  who is bitten; Brad Pitt saves her from the effects of the zombie-bite by chopping off her arm above the bite zone. Is this an allegory of some sort about Israel's fate?  If so, well, so mote it be as long as it takes with it the actors, the writers, the directors, and the producers of this film.

In some ways and on certain level, WWZ was more effective in conveying the dangers of life in our time into our heads than movies about terrorist attacks. There were well conceived dialogs and fantastical special effects throughout the movie. My only gripe about the movie is with Brad Pitt, whose performance was unremarkable and rather dull. Almost every other character at any point of the movie communicated more emotion and realism than Pitt. Gone are the days when this actor could give performances as convincing as the young, inexperienced and victimized detective in SEVEN, or a remorseful vampire in contrast to the Tom Cruise character in Interview With The Vampire. Some actors give more arousing and intense performance as their success and age grow, like Al Pacino and Charlize Theron, some are rendered stoic and trapped in their own skin and could play nothing but themselves, Tom Cruise and John Travolta less so as even though they are aware of their good looks, they don't shy away from delivering emotionally charged performances, while even dying has to look good for Pitt in Fury.",1464652800,,1332,4.950892857142857

Being a long time fan of Brad ( not just a pretty face but to me one of the handful of real old time movie star types we have) Pitt, I always enjoy his intense, heartfelt movies.  This is not your average mindless  blood and gore zombie movie, it is very scary, suspenseful, and intense, a well thought out story, not just effects.  Brad can be tired, dirty, dressed in rags, but still all you do is focus on him when he is on the screen.  A true presence...loved this movie....recommend it to all.",1463702400,,569,4.280373831775701

4778864,4,B005LAIIMG,"VERY SCARY!  the whole living dead meets pbs epidemiology documentary plot was very cool.  and, teachers: it had just enough science in it to show my biology class.  my kids learned some stuff when we discussed it afterward.  indeed, natural selection finally seemed plausible for one of my students who did not ""believe"" in evolution.  he's a smart kid.  he's just from one of those families that goes to church and believes in supernatural stuff like gods and angels and devils and jesuses.  some people believe a whole bunch of weird stuff.  most of it comes from the bible, actually.  they probably get some ideas from songs, too - like hymns & christmas carols.  not all of the stuff you see people doing at christmas is based on the myths in the bible.  there's nothing about stockings and gift giving in the bible (i just word-searched it, btw.)  those traditions are based on christmas carols that talk about god and jesus flying around and delivering presents on christmas eve.  i just googled it, and  it's kind of scary.  although that one has always stuck in my mind.  i remember when i was in kindergarten or first grade that we'd sing it, b/c there was a mentally handicapped boy who started crying once after the class sang it.  It's the one about god knowing who's bad and good and putting together a kind of holiday hitlist for the bad ones.  that poor little kid (it's actually kind of funny in a saturday night live way.  i guess he had concluded that he was or had at one time been bad and the whole class, like the chorus in a greek tragedy is singing ""you better watch out, you'd better look out!""  it's no wonder the poor boy didn't go gouge his eyes out like oedopus.  anyway, my student had an ""ah-ha moment"" despite all of the psychological trauma.  it wasn't a complete victory over ignorance and evil.  he thinks evolution was used to ""create"" the universe.  so, he still believes in god and jesus. ironically, though, this student said he didn't believe in zombies.  it turns out that jesus wasn't a zombie after all!  [however, he's not a ghost, either -at least according to this kid.])

who'd've thought a monster movie'd have such wide curricular value.

incidentally, i used the online rental service on AMZN, b/c i needed it now (then).  the district internet doesn't feature netflix, otherwise i'd've used that -to avoid paying the fee (seemed somewhat high to rent a video for 48 hours.).  maybe i'll subscribe to prime when school resumes in the fall.

that is all.

There are a lot of scenes that will fill you with anxiety and mild panic. From people that have read the book, it is a VERY different movie and, to many, not as enjoyable. However, I do find the acting to be quite good and the story to be compelling. Of course, with Brad Pitt playing the leading role, there has to be some action parts to the film, but I feel that it really delivers!

While still be entertaining, heart pumping, clever, scary, and action packed.  I wasn't bored at all.  The only thing I can see people complain about is character development was on the weak side and it doesn't follow the book.  I for one don't care about it being similar to the book just as long as it is good.  They can always do a tv series later.  Hopefully the character development is fixed in the WWZ2.  Acting, cgi, environments, props, and music was of course on point.

Zombies are fast and strong.
They respond to both sound and sight.
Obviously need head shots but other things can injure them or slow them down like shooting them in the knees.  Burning works too.
Depending where the bite is, cutting off a limb will save you.
Getting their blood in orifices doesn't turn you.
If you have a disease they won't go after you.
Their not smart, but will pile up together to get where they need to go.

I thought it was great! So did my daughter and pretty much everyone else I know who saw it.  I read a lot of ""that would never happen"" in the pre-release criticisms, but I didn't see anything at all in the movie that I thought was totally out of the realm of possibility.  Some stretching of possibilities, maybe, but nothing outrageous.  And, really, it's a ZOMBIE movie - doesn't the whole premise of EVERY zombie movie require viewers to pretty much suspend disbelief as soon as the lights go down in the theater?  And I do not believe for one second that there is any such thing as a ""reasonable"" expectation of what would really happen in the world if such a plague occurred, so how can I be terribly critical of what any writer/director does in any zombie film?  If zombies are possible, so is every potential scenario we've all seen and/or read about.  I thought World War Z was fairly gritty and certainly an enjoyable ride.  Brad Pitt was perhaps a bit more mellow than I would expect a person in his position to be, but if he'd been a screaming hysteric, the military would never have been interested in sending him out to hunt down the origin of the plague.

For example, (spoiler alert) what if you had to justify your spot on the life boat? Next, how does one compare the value of field expertise vs. subject matter expertise?

4780029,4,B005LAIIMG,"World War Z, the movie, has greatly surpassed my expectations in comparison to other zombie films and television shows. I enjoyed the movie so much that I had to pick it up after seeing it in the movie theater. As a casual movie watcher, this is a good watch. For someone who enjoys zombie shows and movies as much as the next person, World War Z kept me on the edge of my seat with its unique plotline and detailed visual effects. Without any previous knowledge of what it is about, the movie is very easy to follow and appeals to all of-age audiences that can appreciate more than the violence and action that comes with your typical zombie-killing movie.

To sum things up shortly, Brad Pitt and his counterparts are part of the few people that haven't been infected with this virus that is essentially turning people into zombies. The movie follows Brad Pitt and his journey to find the source of the infection and to stop this epidemic and to save the world all together.

The first thing that made this movie stand out was the unique plot and structure of the movie. In a typical zombie movie, you can expect the main characters to continually fight through waves of zombies as the movie moves along. World War Z is different. The movie primarily focuses on the path to finding a cure along with all the expected gore and action that you can expect in any zombie movie. The plot helps create a very surreal aspect to the movie. So surreal that something like this could potentially happen in real life.

Another aspect that sets World War Z apart from other zombie movies are the graphics and visual effects. The actors that play the zombies are refined with such detail and are so unique, they seem real. Its hard to create that sense of realness when dealing with zombies but World War Z does a great job accomplishing this. For example, there is one scene were there are a mass amount of zombies climbing over a huge barrier that is done with such technicality that helps create a unique visual appeal to movie watchers of all sorts.

Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase of the movie, World War Z. If you aren't into action-packed films or a fan of Brad Pitt, maybe World War Z isn't for you. But past all the zombie killing and violence, the movie is very well thought out. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, World War Z is always a good choice.",1455235200,10,2375,4.4528735632183905

The serial, newpaper clipping style of writing works well in book form, but makes for a narrative nightmare in movies; you don't know who to root for because you're constantly learning who this new character is. It's distracting. The producers of this film did a good job of capturing the essence of what the point of the Brooks work was about: a less than grim, not quite tongue in cheek fun glimpse at the end of the world, a la zombies. The story doesn't make sense, things happen to Brad Pitt that aren't plausible, but since you're watching a film about ten thousand zombies piling over one another to breach the 100ft wall of Jerusalem constructed on an email hunch, you might be missing the point by focusing on the one fake tree in a forest of real ones.

They did a good job presenting the zombies without over-doing the gore of it, while still emphasizing the danger and horror of it by using the sounds and the inhuman speed and lurching quality of the creatures' movements.

Brad Pitt and zombies!
The action you'll probably enjoy if the movie you see!

I have the PG-13 version on DVD. Let alone if Brad's character was killed, I thought I'd hear the shrieks and screams of females everywhere if his face was even scratched! After some necessary set-up, the movie is fast-paced, the action virtually non-stop. At times it was even riveting. Unlike other zombie movies and even zombie television shows, the violence was not grotesque. They've long ago figured out in Hollywood how to keep certain movies a PG-13 and not an R so the potential audience is considerably larger. It consists of not focusing close-up on the blood or only showing the blood in quick close-ups with quick cutaways. The beginning of the movie with Pitt's character's family in peril had me thinking of his movie ""Babel"" and Tom Cruise's ""War Of The Worlds"".",1450569600,2,870,4.8

The idea of the zombies not intent on the classic motivation of consuming human flesh but as harbingers of Mother Nature's plan to thin out the population is refreshingly brilliant.  The zombies are focused only on spreading the sickness which somehow makes the underlying theme here more terrifying even without the eye-popping zombie killing effects of the Walking Dead. The enemy here is fast and sinister in it's flock-like desire to get to the uninfected, and their movements are squirm-worthy compared to the shuffling and moaning to which we've already become complacent.  Purists loyal to the Brooks novel (interestingly enough, written by Mel Brook's son) will possibly be bent by the minimal adherence to the original story arc, but will have to give props to the compelling storyline presented here.

4784844,4,B005LAIIMG,"World War Z is a film that tries to take a real world approach to a Zombie Apocalypse scenario.  I enjoyed the movie and was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I did not think it was as entertaining as the newer Dawn of the Dead movie but still found it definitely worth watching.  Several of the scenes in the movie seem realistic and probably would occur if that type of plague happened.

Some other films come to mind that show how the spread of a worldwide epidemic can occur.  Like at the end of Rise of Planet of the Apes where the airlines spread the disease all over the world is one that stood out right away to me.  World War Z is not your typical mindless zombie romp film.  I thought some scenes were great.  For instance when Brad Pitt shoots someone at a super market who is trying to assault his wife and the cop nearby totally ignores him because he is looking out for himself and has no interest in enforcing the law when personal survival is at stake.  Its a powerful scene and the movie is full of moments like that.

 The movie is slow paced don't expect constant action like a Resident Evil movie.  I actually prefer a movie like this which concentrates on how to solve the epidemic rather than just trying to survive such as the Night of the Living Dead trilogy.  I do see a couple of flaws with the super zombie theory.  I am surprised no one mentioned the wait it out theory like in the film 28 Days Later with the human body unable to supplement energy without food acting as fuel wouldnt the zombies die of malnutrition/starvation and keel over after a few weeks.  Like at the end of 28 days later.  Also if Israel was so smart wouldnt they recognize the effect of sound that stimulates the zombies, watching those people cheering and singing riling up the zombies you would have thought the guards would have been monitoring them and telling them to knock it off and stop singing.  I have a hard time seeing people celebrating like that so close to danger on the other side of the wall.  It goes beyond stupid but hey its a movie.

 The film definitely gives you a feeling of the zombie epidemic on a global scale, where you would not be safe anywhere, but on a deserted island or ocean ship in this case.  I thought the passenger airplane scene was a little farfetched but other than that I enjoyed the movie especially the England CDC lab scenes.  Like Fight Club I think this is one of Brad Pitts better movies.  I found this much better than 12 Monkeys I hated that film.  World War Z has a nice mix of action and realism.  I enjoyed the extermination scenes at the end the film probably could have used more time on that montage sequence.  I also was thinking the farmers and people in rural U.S. probably survived much better than those in the cities.  Its not perfect but I found it entertaining and would rate it 4 stars.",1447113600,,2865,4.356603773584905

4789861,2,B005LAIIMG,"A very mediocre film that should've been a very powerful and memorable movie about zombies (based on the book of the same name, by author Max Brooks).  Many people will recognize the name Robert Kirkman because of The Walking Dead's popularity, but Max Brooks deserves as much credit for resurrecting (pun intended) the zombie post apocalyptic genre with his books: The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z.

To be clear, the book WWZ is superior (but most book mediums are anyways) and deals with slow-moving, classic zombies; not the 28 Days/Weeks Later zombies on crack that we see in this movie with Brad Pitt.  Not only were the zombies just way to fast (rabies & steroids), but it would cause the world to be entirely infected in a mater of a day or so, as opposed to the breakdown shown in say, The Walking Dead or other zombie universes.

What the movie did get right, was the govt. survival; what it didn't get right is pretty much everything else; the zombies were like CG ants and completely different from the book, the PG-13 rating made for some non-gory zombie violence (which kind of goes against the genre in itself, and thankfully TWD tv show isn't a family friendly version of the comic), the characters were forgettable, the story not told from a narrative in the aftermath (like the book), and the suspension of disbelief great when grenades go off in airplanes and yet the main characters survive the crash landing.

This is a prime example of a movie suffering too much creative control and divergence from the source material, as another studio decision to make a PG-13 action film to make more money/get more viewers instead of an R-rated horror film truly depicting a zombie apocalypse.",1444608000,4,1712,4.750841750841751

For a while I thought it was ok, asking you to believe increasingly ridiculous things like tossing a hand grenade in the back of a plane in flight and surviving.  Ok.  But when Brad had to inject himself with a deadly virus without knowing which one or how much to use that was a bridge too far.  I wanted to yell ""Try 500 cc of the blue one and stay near a bathroom!""  I made it to the end but there really wasn't one.

4794387,5,B005LAIIMG,"But it's pretty darn good.  I'm still not sure whether these are traditional ""zombies"", or something else. They moved very quickly at times and didn't appear to be terribly hungry for living flesh. If you're one of those people who avoid ""zombie"" shows because of the gore, you should watch this.  There's not a lot of gore and the ""zombies"" don't lose body parts when they move. As with many zombie movies, some of the non-zombies are pretty despicable.

I won't ruin the movie for you, but I thought the remedy to the ""zombie"" situation was interesting and unique.  Plus, even though Brad Pitt is having a hard time trying to save the world, he looks great (as usual).  In addition, some professional critics opined that the depiction of Israel was really a commentary on the political situation in the Middle East.  Who knows?  Who cares?  With zombies, you don't want to dig too deep because you'll uncover a number of ""wait a second, that makes no sense"" moments.  Just accept that it's only a movie and enjoy.  I did!!

I liked the way it starts, a typical family getting ready for the day. Eating breakfast, getting two girls ready for school, playing a game in traffic--when all hell breaks loose!
Other characters he meets along the way trying to find out how to fix the world are well thought out and the clues he finds fairly easy to put together. My other favorite character is Segen, the Israeli soldier. She sees what she needs to do and does it.
I'm not saying this is a movie for the ages, it probably isn't, but I like it over all. It's zombies are not the slow moving ones of The Walking Dead. You have to move faster. Once they are introduced the action doesn't stop. Love it and as I said, Brad Pitt.",1439251200,,878,4.263473053892215

First, the CIA has to bring back the only man capable of saving the world, based on the fact that he was on the ground in Biafra or Serbia or some place during an ethnic-cleansing incident. Are we to believe he was the only person on earth with those credentials? Then, the mission was to discover the point of origin of the oiutbreak, but about half-way through the movie that line is abandoned, and it just gets more and more silly after that.

Lots of gore, howeverr, and the super-charged zombies are more scarey than the slugs encountered in most zombie movies. I will agree, it is a fine movie for seventh graders or anyone with a seventh-grade mentality.",1438992000,,709,4.496124031007752

Still not a bad flick, but it's hard to even give it 3 stars.

Do you love movies with excessive camera shake in action scenes?

Do you love it when they use cheap stock sound effects in movies?

Do you love it when the characters do completely irrational nonsensical things?

Do you love sappy boring family\love stories in your apocalypse flicks?

Yeah, there is a lot of movie sins in this one, it's one of those films you just have to turn off your critical side, eat pop corn, drink soda, and lower your IQ so you can just have a good time. I tried hard to, but it was just over the top stupid when the hero finally reached the W.H.O. was healed by them, then tries to play tough guy and not want to talk with them? HUH!? Who wrote this stinker?

If we've learned anything from zombie films, it's that the military must use nerf guns, can't aim, don't have many bombs, have very few if any tanks, don't have huge supplies and plenty of ammo to kill billions of people 20 times over, and that writers who write this stuff badly underestimate the armed forces. I've also learned that Brad Pitt isn't the best fit for movies like this.

4799948,2,B005LAIIMG,"This review will contain some spoilage, but I'll try to keep it to a minimum,

I'm one of those people that ""read the book"" so when I heard they were making a movie from it, I was very hopeful for the result.  The book seems to lend itself well towards a visual presentation.  There's a combination of zombie ""action"", plus, contemplative themes.  Sadly, this movie is only one half of that equation.  So the parts that are action oriented aren't terrible and those parts are watchable.  But this is not even close to the story that anyone who read the book would find familiar.

If you want an action movie, sure, enjoy it.  I was disappointed that the 'solution'  essentially had no consequence or effort.  It's sad that this movie is missing all the themes of deception, sacrifice and perseverance (as well as the brief moments of humour) that made the book so outstanding.",1437868800,,876,4.62987012987013

Instead of a real thriller, this film becomes a tired-out Dawn of the Dead full-length-feature-flick with a few interesting twists. There were HUGE holes in the plot as well. So how long would it have taken for hospitals throughout the world to figure out that the zombies would only attack healthy humans?  Even the gravitas of Brad Pitt couldn't keep this from being a campy comedy, destined to be a cult film for the zombie-impaired. The only star in this two star film is the female Israeli soldier who loses her arm to one of the creepy-crab-walking-zombie-crawlers.

4803109,5,B005LAIIMG,"From start to finish, this is a thriller of the highest caliber.  The point of view it takes is almost that of 'what would you do' in many instances.  The pace is heart pounding and it's propelled by how the protagonist, Brad Pitt's character, must deal with an infectious outbreak of a highly communicable virus that is changing humankind into mindless zombies.  To be sure, this genre has been overworked numerous times before, but what distinguishes this film from the majority of others is that it derives its suspense not from copious amounts of vividly shown gore, but quite the opposite, it deals more in inferred violence (though there are some violent scenes too.....full disclosure).  Once you start viewing this apocalyptic nightmare thriller, you won't be able to stop.  You'll be drawn into a thrill ride that won't disappoint.",1436313600,,840,5.014388489208633

4803117,4,B005LAIIMG,"I thought it was pretty good.  Exciting, suspenseful and adds to the zombie apocalypse legends.  Not perfect because it doesn't make any sense how the zombies can remain animated without eating flesh or brains for long periods of time.  It doesn't even seem like that is what they are after, they just want to spread the disease and not really eat anyone.  I knew Brad Pitt wasn't going to die, but I had the highest hopes for that Israeli girl even after having her arm chopped off.  The queue for takeoff from Jerusalem is a remarkable scene I won't soon forget and holds that unique production value you look for that sets each film apart.  A part of you dies a little with the Navy Seal who gives his life to unhook the fuel hose so they can take off from Humphreys.  Elen Rhys makes a star turn as the flight attendant who looked a little too put together considering the circumstances (Who is the blonde on Belarus Air?)  Playback and video quality was smooth.  Moody lighting requires viewing in a dark room throughout the feature.",1436054400,2,1038,4.537634408602151

4803353,2,B005LAIIMG,"The 2 daughters and wife are worthless  All were weak and contributed nothing to surviving.  One daughter had asthma when the human gene pool needs the best -not the worst.  Their contribution to the movie was screaming and one of the older daughters wanting her blanket which had me rooting for the zombies to get her immediately.  There are millions of humans who deserved to live - rather than these 3.  Too bad their characters were not more well developed.  I was rooting for all 3 to die in the first 15 minutes of the movie.  The boy in the movie was great.  He was a survivor - strong, healthy, smart and brave....everything the 2 girls and the wife were not.

The husband's character was fine.  He is just not that great an actor.  If his first family had died and he found a strong woman with strong children who were actively fighting and surviving and he joined in with them or had children with her later after they find a  safe zone,.I would give this movie 5 stars.",1435968000,,980,4.41340782122905

Action packed from the opening scene, Brad Pitt, apparently already renowned as a go to world saver, is recalled to do it again. Unfortunately Brad is in his SUV, happy family in tow, and already surrounded by screeching zombies, when he gets word of his new mission so naturally saving them is his first priority. Battling his way out of town, Pitt's portrayal of the sincere family man cloaking a super smart hero emerges well supported by all the cast. Once Pitt thinks his family is secure he's off on a worldwide disaster trek made all the more real by flawless effects to find a cure. Teamed as a facilitator with a whiz kid Doctor, tension mounts early on when the young doctor dies. It doesn't let up as Brad heroically carries on discovering that in this experiment he's the guinea pig.",1433721600,,886,4.613924050632911

Worse than that, it was amazingly boring. I watched this movie free on amazon prime without any real expectations and I still feel ripped off. I cant imagine how much I would have hated it if I had actually paid. Almost any low budget zombie movie is better than World War Z. It felt like a group of the worst Hollywood hacks scribbled the script on cocktail napkins while the film was being shot. I found this surprising, given that it was supposed to be loosely based on a book. The only zombie related movie as bad as World War Z is probably 3 Days Dead (from the SyFy channels town of the living dead series). As tragically bad as 3 Days Dead was, the only thing that put it in the same category as World War Z was that 3 Days Dead had inaudible sound (sound quality I would consider unusable for even an amateur YouTube video.  In World War Z you can hear what they are saying but you just don't care. The Z in World War Z does not stand for Zombie.

4807657,4,B005LAIIMG,This movie was a lot better than we expected.  Lots of action and suspense.  Bonus - the zombies were portrayed in a different way and not nearly as gross as others...they weren't shown eating people; you do see a bite or two but nothing too nasty.,1432944000,,248,4.369565217391305

4808052,5,B005LAIIMG,"If you happen to enjoy zombie movies, this one is centered in the medical aspects of what creates them.  Brad Pitt is completely believable as a husband/father (and United Nations employee) barely escaping with his family in an initial outbreak before being called upon to help investigate and possibly save humanity from the spread of the actual virus.  Not so much a shoot 'em up bang-bang style we're all pretty accustomed to, but nevertheless has its moments of bloody survival, heart pounding fast action and the constant threat to his own safety as he must be the one to test his own theory.  Hubby and I enjoyed this very much and purchase the film after viewing it.",1432944000,,673,4.735042735042735

Movie itself is excellent. Really liked the story, but the 3D gets a solid B- score. Would definitely watch again.",1529193600,,271,4.44
