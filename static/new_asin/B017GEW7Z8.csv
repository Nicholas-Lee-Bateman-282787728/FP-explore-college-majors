8739067,4,B017GEW7Z8,"Evelyn Laye interrupted her long career in theater and made one movie with Sam Goldwyn Studios in 1930. Years later MGM signed Laye to make this movie entitled The night is young in 1935 with Ramon Novarro, the last of its original 1924 stars. This was his last movie at MGM. Vicki Baum (author) signed Romberg (music), Oscar Hammerstein II (libretto) and the delighted Ms. Laye to play opposite Ramon Novarro. In this schmaltz of an archduke and a brilliant ballerina, love falls flat and doesnt end in marriage, but produced two hit songs, when I grow too old to dream and the title number. But the direction of Dudley Murphy did not help producer Harry Rapf to recapture his musical zest of Broadway Melody. The comedic acts of Charles Butterworth, Una Merkel, and Edward Everett Horton are great in supporting category.

Actress Rosalind Russell also has plays in a supporting role, but she was still a budding star at MGM. Her career grew fast after this movie. Evelyn Laye, for most of her career did musical comedies and operetta, but performed in a very few Hollywood film musicals with no success. She continued acting in pantomimes. I am a big fan of actor Ramon Novarro and loved all his films and this is no exception, but director Dudley Moore could have considered other alternatives to the ending of this love story.",1458691200,5,1331,4.737068965517241
8739068,5,B017GEW7Z8,Excellent romance and lovely singing.  Saw this when I was very young and was extremely moved by it.  Same thing happened 40 years later after seeing it again.  Novarro is a joy to watch.,1458518400,2,187,4.4411764705882355
