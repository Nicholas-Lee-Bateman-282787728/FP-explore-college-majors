4307024,2,B004AC6PXA,Having taught Kindergarten for 9 years I can say that this video is cute but not as good as previous Leap Frog videos. The Letter Factory is a much better presentation of the letters with emphasis on letter sounds (needed to learn to read) vs. letter names.  If you buy only one leap frog video I would recommend the Letter Factory video.,1299628800,70,338,4.451612903225806
4307025,5,B004AC6PXA,The Amazing Alphabel Amusement Park was very entertaining for my 1 yr. old grandson.  He loves it and quiets down when watching it.,1299542400,,131,4.695652173913044
4307026,5,B004AC6PXA,My children love all the Leap Frog videos and this one is a new favorite.  Leap Frog makes these videos so kid friendly to keep there attention and very educational.  I love it!,1299456000,,177,4.333333333333333
4307027,3,B004AC6PXA,"I was delighted to find this and other Leap Frog videos available on instant play from **the popular DVD rental/streaming video company** to which we subscribe.  My 4.5 yr. old and I watched The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park today and I found the video to be disappointing.  As an elementary teacher, I have to say that the original Letter Factory is so much more effective for teaching letters/sounds.  The most disappointing part of this video was that it doesn't teach letter sounds at all.  It basically teaches two skills:  letter recognition and rhyming.  On a positive note, I thought the video did a good job of pointing out differences in letters that look similar (such as ""i"" and ""j"").  They also effectively presented both uppercase and lowercase letters simultaneously.  Overall, this is a decent video for toddlers and younger preschoolers.  But, if you're looking to make a purchase, I recommend buying the Letter Factory instead of this one.",1298592000,22,959,5.018987341772152
4307028,5,B004AC6PXA,My daughter loves this video!!  For months I tried to get her to do flash cards to recognize letters.  She has known the alphabet for years but only recognized a few letters.  This video she asks to watch so she can learn.  It's working!  Thank you leap frog!,1298332800,,259,4.3125
4307029,4,B004AC6PXA,"I loved that this video really teaches Big and Little letters, as the Letter Factory leapfrog movie doesn't. There was a lot of great repetition, and my 2yr old loves it. The cadence of the singing voice throughout most of the movie is kind of creepy sounding and strange to me. My son doesn't care though, and it's not too weird to watch. He likes the dog and calls out the letters with the narrator/singer.  Definitely worth buying, and seems right at a very early alphabet learners level.",1297814400,3,491,4.579545454545454
4307030,2,B004AC6PXA,I received 2 DVDs of the same thing why is that?  I don't remember ordering 2 of the same,1297814400,,89,3.6842105263157894
4307031,5,B004AC6PXA,"My 3 year old loves this movie. She has known her letters for a while but she still really likes the show.  I like that it shows her both the Capital (Big) letter and the lowercase (small) letter.  In my experience most preschools, daycare's, etc. only teach them the capital letter.  I highly recommend this product.",1297728000,2,317,4.625
4307032,3,B004AC6PXA,"I think the first review gives a great summary of this DVD.  I think this DVD is aimed at those that are somewhere between 18 months and 3 years of age (or any child that doesn't know their letters).  This movie was quite boring for my 3.5 year old that knows all of his letters and their sounds.  I thought it would be a fun alphabet refresher for him but it didn't work out that way.  It did talk a bit about the concept of rhyming but I'm pretty sure that will go right over the heads of the ones that will actually enjoy this DVD.

I think Leap Frog could have done a better job than this.",1295654400,11,593,3.9915254237288136
4307033,4,B004AC6PXA,"Along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Numbers-Ahoy/dp/B004AC6PN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Numbers Ahoy</a>, ""The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park"" is the newest release in the LeapFrog DVD series. It features the new design first seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Let-s-Go-to-School/dp/B002BJGYJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Let's Go to School</a>&nbsp;and also introduces a new character, Scout, who LeapFrog fans might be familiar with if they own, or know of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-My-Pal-Scout/dp/B001W30D2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog My Pal Scout</a>.

Like most LeapFrog releases, this is done well. Scout is a fun addition to the series, though if you were expecting him to talk, forget it. He is Lily and Tad's pet dog through and through and he communicates through barking, yipping and body language. But he is a curious and also mischievous little scamp and adds a lot of entertainment value. The animation is fun to watch, the educational content is strong and the songs are generally fun and catchy.

In this adventure, Tad and Lily find themselves in a bit of a jam when Scout snatches letters from around town and buries them in their yard. They want to return the letters to their owners, but they don't know which is which. Edison, the firefly, offers to take them on the Learning Path to the Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park. But a cotton candy mishap causes Edison to get stuck to a ferris wheel. The rides at the park are all powered down and Lily & Tad must learn to recognize letter shapes, both uppercase and lowercase, in order to power them back up. They also learn about rhyming.

If some of this feels familiar, it is. There was already an extensive alphabet song back in ""Let's Go to School,"" so those that are watching here might rightly wonder why Tad & Lily still can't recognize letters. And while the alphabet song works well in short bits throughout the film, it really drags when they present the entire thing together at the end. Also, Tad & Lily refer to the letters throughout as ""big and small,"" but there is no reference to the proper terminology of ""uppercase and lowercase."" I know that that may be a bit much for younger children, but I think they should have used those terms at least once, just so that if the kids hear parents or educators using them, they won't be completely unfamiliar with them.

Despite these somewhat minor faults, this is an excellent release and it also comes with some great bonus features. There is a preview for ""Numbers Ahoy!"" at the end of the film, though if you bought that along with this DVD, then you won't need it. Another really fun bonus feature is ""Being a Puppy (The Scout Song)."" Not just yipping or barking - this song is both about Scout and performed by him! One really welcome bonus feature (one that would have been great on past DVD releases) is a series of commentaries by Dr. Carolyn Jaynes, the educational consultant for these releases. She explains for parents and educators exactly what concepts are reinforced by the DVD, and how to best use it. Other bonus features include sing-alongs, vowel shorts and trailers. Also, the DVD is fully closed-captioned, something that is very pleasing, since the DVDs before the redesign never had captioning.",1295395200,31,3448,5.415270018621974
4307034,4,B004AC6PXA,"This is a very cute video and my daughter loves it. I would have given 5 stars, other than the fact that it only teaches the names of the letters, not the sounds. However, it shows both the the capital and lowercase form of the letters, and it goes pretty extensively into lessons on rhyming words- both bonuses. The Letter Factory, also by Leapfrog, is a fantastic video and it does a great job teaching the letter sounds to kids. If you are going to purchase only one or the other, I would go with The Letter Factory. But if you already own that one, this is a great supplement and a cute, engaging video.",1483142400,,607,4.28695652173913

4307087,3,B004AC6PXA,"Okay, so my kids have all loved the Letter Factory and the World Factory and the 2nd Letter Factory (now called Code Word, or something). Those were excellent, 5-star videos. With their help, all my children learned their letter names and sound before they were 2 years old. My complaints about this one and the other newer ones are as follows:

1. Suddenly Tad's older sister Lilly is now his twin. Huh?
2. This tad's voice is terrible.
3. The previews go on and on and on and on and on. They didn't have any previews in the first Leapfrog videos I bought and these previews make it really hard to get to the main movie in the car where my daughter watches these. It is sooo annoying to me that I'm tempted to give it only one star. Really.

The plus. My daughter doesn't care that Tad's voice is annoying or that Lilly's age suddenly changed. She enjoys the songs. These reinforce the first Leapfrog videos but are definitely NOT a replacement. Buy those first. I'm glad I got these for her, but I put in the others more.",1401062400,2,1023,4.378947368421053

4307091,3,B004AC6PXA,"This video isn't my favorite.  I am a huge fan of The Letter Factory and The Talking Words Factory but was disappointed in this video.  My three year old likes it but I think The Letter Factory is MUCH better than this video. In The Letter Factory, kids learn their letters AND the letter sound.  In this video, they only learn the sound.  I dislike that the main song about the letters says, ""Big A, little A, Big B, little B, etc.""  For an educational video, I feel like kids should learn the proper name for the letters so saying uppercase and lowercase would have been more appropriate.  Also, the dog is smarter than the kids and some of the rides they ride, in real life, these kids would be too young to get on.  That doesn't seem appropriate because what if my kid wants to go on one of those rides the next time we are at an amusement park because he saw Tad and Lily riding them.  Tad's voice is super whiny and their eyes are kind of creepy because they are too shiny, trying to be realistic.  It's also strange that the creators made Tad and Lily twins since in the aforementioned videos, Lily is older.  Don't buy this video, stick with The Letter Factory.",1394409600,,1169,4.321100917431193

In just a couple days of watching this DVD is already learned his lower case letters, in which case he already knew all his upper case letters.

I thought it was too soon for him to lean the alphabet, but played it for him anyway for it was cute, entertaining and I though he might learn something, like 1 or 3 letters (and he loved the elephant on the cartoon). Well, by the time he was 2yrs-1 month he learned all the alphabet! (I even filmed a video of him) and was able to say the letters in random order. We then purchased him the Leapfrog laptop that has the phonics and a named of an animal for each letter, and by the time he was 2yrs and a half he learned the phonics for each letter (and what each animal sounds like, lol).

4307109,5,B004AC6PXA,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I felt like I had to post a review.  We found this video when my son was 22 months old and we needed something to keep him busy while packing.  He, of course, had very little exposure to letters at that point, as opposed to other reviewers children, which colors my review.  My son loved this video (along with Numberland) and within a couple of weeks knew all of the letters (with a bit of confusion for the lower case b,d, p and q).  Yes, I understand the importance of the letter sounds in learning to read, but for an introduction to the letters this video was great for my son.  He ""reads"" his alphabet books to me all the time, so proud of himself that he can name all of the letters, and he isn't even 25 months old.  For an older child this is probably too basic, but for a child that is just learning, I think its great.  And at the very least, I don't feel awful about my son watching tv when watching leap frog videos!",1355270400,,973,4.171122994652406

He watches it nearly every day at least once. He sings alone and he's learning his letter through this. Leap frog is doing VERY well in the movie department. It's all learning but it's very main stream. So the kids actually like them.,1352505600,,370,4.225352112676056
4307113,1,B004AC6PXA,"This video is pretty boring. The value of the previous leapfrog phonics videos were the catchy songs. You could sing the song from the letter factory and know the sounds all the letters make. The song in this video is boring and repetitive. The song is easily forgettable and teaches nothing. Without the visual of the video there is no knowledge remaining with ""Big A little A"" and so on and so forth repeated.

This video makes zero sense in the context of the previous videos. In this video Tad and Lily are twins. In previous videos it seems apparent that Lily is older. I understand that they did this to make the concept appealing to both genders. In the end they ended up muddying the waters and making this a very dull video that makes zero sense when combined with the previous letter factory videos;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Letter-Factory/dp/B0000INU6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Letter Factory</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Talking-Words-Factory/dp/B001U7NW20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory</a>

4307128,2,B004AC6PXA,"Shame on you LeapFrog, you need to do a much better job than this! This video is not bad if you want your child to watch something trivial that has a smidgen of learning, but honestly, there is very little educational content in this and ALL of the Leapfrog videos I have watched, so LeapFrog should not market them as such!

I am talking from experience, as a former elementary school teacher and learning specialist, as well as trained animator (MFA) and parent of a toddler. I am utterly appalled at the amount of actual learning in all of the Leapfrog videos I have watched. Gosh, I timed the actual amount of learning time in these videos and let me tell you, for the entire 39 minutes of  each of your ""educational videos"" there is actually an average of less than 8 minutes of actual learning time going on! Something is considerably WRONG with that ratio.

I don't know what is going down in Emeryville, CA, but something needs to change! To me this is a case the Emperor's New Clothes. A suggestion to you would be to go to your backyard UC Berkeley campus and get a bunch of graduate teachers to review this for free.
