8084540,5,B000BBOUKY,"Anime surely has a large arsenal of cute (or moe) anime ranging from Azumanga Diaoh to Lucky Star, but most of those anime have one aspect in common- they are always based around a high school life. However, this anime takes place in space and on other astral bodies. This anime has its rag-tag cast doing rather random tasks. I say random because each episode is about 12 minutes, rather than the usual 20 something minute episode that almost anime have (with the exception of Cromartie High School.) Therefore, not much time is devoted on each episode's plot or gimmick.

Most people will probably be interested in this anime because of the abundance of cute anime characters. I also fall in this category ever since I saw images from this show, and I wondered what kind of anime is Galaxy Angel? It is the kind of anime that will make you laugh at the kind of hijinks that the characters endure. However, a lot of the humor is either hit or miss especially with the English voice cast. The anime is dubbed by the Ocean Group, which have dubbed anime such as Death Note and Black Lagoon, but don't expect the intense mood of those two anime for this title. Episode plots consist of locating a rare animal to preventing a suicidal missile from detonating. It is indeed random, and that is the charm for this anime; that and the insanely cute characters, particularly Milfeulle, the pink haired girl on the cover, and Mint, the blue haired character with bunny ears. Its as if the creators for this show thought that she wasn't cute enough, so they gave her rabbit ears, and the penchant to play dress up to make her even more cute.

If there is anything wrong with the anime it is the fact that there is no true plot and that you could watch almost any episode in any order. There is a special feature on the DVDs that does describe the plot of the show, but it really does not matter, especially for those that only watch this season. Yes, it is true there are a few more seasons, but from what I have seen from those episodes, there is not much of a story, but the series does seem to get progressively funnier and more random as the different seasons progressed.

This collection comes to us from Bandai Entertainment; it is enclosed in one of those brick anime cases like most of Bandai and ADV Films anime collections. It doesn't really take up too much shelf space, which is always good. Overall, it is a fun little anime that probably a lot of people have not heard of, but should.",1380758400,,2489,4.465934065934066
8084541,5,B000BBOUKY,"What can I say? Galaxy Angel was a masterpeice of comedy Anime that proves that a Anime female cast can be treated normally, respectfully, and still be funny without over excessive use of Nude shots or excessive cussing Funimation anime's seem to have nowadays NO this Anime actually has flare and does random WTF comedy RIGHT and deserves to be part of your shelf if it isn't already",1345248000,2,384,4.661764705882353

8084543,5,B000BBOUKY,"I recently purchased this set of Galaxy Angel and this ones the best yet.  I found ALL of the episodes funny.  A couple episodes in the 2nd season just weren't that funny IMHO but this one almost made me choke laughing.

The dub version is the one I watched and they pulled it off flawlessly.  They are the SAME dubbed cast as the first two series, not different ones as another reviewer wrote.

Plus, the pricing is right on this set.  You get 325 minutes of some of the most hilarious Galaxy Angel for only $30 something dollars.",1140739200,10,531,4.36734693877551
8084544,5,B000BBOUKY,"I don't care what others say about the voice actors I think they rock. This anime is full of fun, I almost laughed my head off watching it. So for those party poopers out there this cartoon was great!",1138492800,4,200,4.153846153846154
8084545,5,B000BBOUKY,"I've been a fan of Galaxy Angel since season one~Back then, the randomness and cuteness got the best of me. It still holds true in season 3, Galaxy Angel A. Still full of cuteness but the stories are much more random than ever~Mifuelle enlightnening Mint, or Ranpha falling in love with Forte after Forte accidentally turned into a man because of a lost technology!?!?! Season 3 introduce the Twin Star Team, far more competent than Galaxy Angel~and they're only 10 years old boys! I actually think season 3 is much more hilarious than season 1 or 2. In this package you all 26 episodes totalling 325 minutes in three discs with a bonus episode in the last disc. I'm just curious to why they decide to package all the episodes of season 3 into one package while in season 1 or 2 you had to buy it separately. Cheaper, but I wish the did the same for those two seasons.",1136073600,15,868,4.43125
8084546,4,B000BBOUKY,"I've been watching Galaxy Angel A. Compared to the other Galaxy Angel Series. The characters have other voices in the english version.

Micu, Mint's pet cat died (of course it happened in some Galaxy Angel episode) Then, in one episode, Milfeulle was hypnotoized by someone. Mifeulle was acting as Mint's dead pet cat.

Mint was surprised to see her pet cat, but in a form of Milfeulle.

Since Animax (a channel in Asia) producted Galaxy Angel A. But now it's Galaxy Angel.

I hope you guys know its last dish is Rebecca.

To conclude this review, I say that I grade Galaxy Angel A is 4 stars because this was a little funny.",1133395200,,625,4.495575221238938
