7903125,5,B000003K8I,"I really loved DS9's take on the Mirror Universe introduced in the original ST series. This episode,shattered Mirror,pulls out all the stops as Jake Sisko meets the alternate universe person of his dead mother. Also featured is the alter-Worf as the Alliance Regent. Michael Dorn really lets loose as his alter ego. Andrew Robinson-Garak- is a delight as Regent Worf's prisoner. Nana Visitor as the Intendent Kira is equally delightful. This is a welcome romp in the midst of the Dominion War.",1363564800,,493,5.024390243902439
7903126,4,B000003K8I,"This episode has great special effects, and I for one never get tired of great space battles in DS9. However, when compared to previous episodes such as ""The Way of the Warrior"", it pales in comparison. The Alliance sees fit to send at most six ships to try and retake the station, yet in ""The Way of the Warrior"" a massive Klingon fleet is dispatched to DS9. And isn't Terok Nor supposed to be orbiting Bajor? What happened to the planet?",1089244800,2,439,4.432098765432099
7903127,5,B000003K8I,"In a great mirror universe adventure Sisko must help O'Brien put the  finishing touches to a Defiant they have built, you see an Alliance ship is  on it's way with an evil Worf as it's Captain. In a greatly over-acted  episode we get to see Worf and Sisko go head to head as the Defiant  look-a-like goes up against a ship 10 times the size of it. Great plot and  top-notch special effects!",966729600,10,390,4.287671232876712
