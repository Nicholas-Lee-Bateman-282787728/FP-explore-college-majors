8315405,5,B001KN3MNI,"At first I was disappointed because I was expecting a movie filmed from a helicopter, with a guide pointing out all the landmarks.  This is ""only"" a slide show, with only music, no narration.  But then I realized that the slide-show format packs in many more views of San Francisco than could possibly be included in a movie of the same length (30 minutes).  A one-week rental isn't enough for this video.  I'm going to buy it, then take my time identifying all the locations using Google Earth.  For now, I'm just going to kick back and enjoy the images.",1320624000,,555,4.51

where was Golden gate Park?  precidio? Must be a hard core S.F. buff to appreciate this book.",1229904000,,178,4.741935483870968

I can't write a review on my own DVD, but I am writing this so I can post a video sample from the DVD. Of course this is much faster then images play on the DVD. If you want a loaded USB flash drive for an hdtv with ""Gallery Player"" or similar and USB port, visit SFBAYSTORE.com. The DVD is very popular and is playing the lobbies of some nice places. This represts a body of digital aerial photography work spanning 5 years, so there are many views of the city.  The DVD is formatted for HDTV. It is 1080p at 24fps for those who want to know. It is great gift idea for those who love to travel and love San Francisco, America's favorite City. Enjoy! Sandra Cannon

The camera used for this digital photography book is Canon EOS 20D. I have since upgraded.",1226102400,2,1147,5.945454545454545
