6120782,5,B00GWOQM5U,A brilliant documentary not just about craft beer but small business and the American dream.

6120792,5,B00GWOQM5U,"I don't write many reviews but feel compelled to for this movie.  First of all I do like craft beers and drink some of them. But that's not the reason I loved this movie.

6120796,5,B00GWOQM5U,Great story! You don't have to a beer fan to enjoy tis one. Whats even better is that the BSB is here in Denver and I was able to enjoy their Red Ale while watching it the 2nd time!,1431907200,,181,3.6666666666666665

6120813,1,B00GWOQM5U,"Crafting a Nation is overemotional, too sentimental, and dour for its own good.  The documentary depicts how tough the brewery business is, how devoted new brewers are, and how much many of them are devoted to their communities.  All of the stories portrayed in the film are all very interesting.  But they all come off as pretentious.  The film is scored to music that could be substituted in an episode of Friday Night Lights.  The whole film has this slow droll to it where the music is used to convey the seriousness of the topic; the idea that these breweries mean a lot to the people who run and work in them.  I get it.  But in the end it is just beer.  It is this sort of representation of craft beer that drives AB InBev to run ads that troll craft beer fans.  In one interview, the 21st Amendments brewmaster actually gets choked up at brewing 30 barrels of watermelon infused wheat beer.  Thats right.  Watermelon.  If you are interested in process, how barley is grown and malted, how wort gets made, or about the contribution of different hops in IPAs, or how water is manipulated to make the beer you like watch something else.  This movie does not actually talk about beer.  It aims to make you feel something about the people who open and run breweries.  This film tries to make the case that brewers are special but in doing so he over-sentimentalizes the endeavors of these ambitious individuals.  This presentation ultimately trivializes the hard work that these men, and their families, exert to build a product that they are proud of.  It makes a caricature of craft beer and makes it fodder for the likes of shows like Portlandia.  It forgets that beer is just beer and that beer is supposed to be fun.",1425945600,2,1724,4.542207792207792
6120814,5,B00GWOQM5U,"If you're into craft beer, or are considering it, and the relationship between locally owned craft breweries and their communities, you will enjoy this documentary.

8627996,4,B00GWOQM5U,"The profiles were very interesting.  However, it was a little hard to follow ""who was who"" at times (the transitions between segments). I give the doc 4 stars for the interesting subject matter and showing depth of the brewer's journey.  However, it did move a tad too slowly for me (not that I like fast edited documentaries) and seemed a little long. I recommend to anyone that likes artisanal food and drinks (even if you don't drink beer).",1439164800,,443,4.666666666666667
