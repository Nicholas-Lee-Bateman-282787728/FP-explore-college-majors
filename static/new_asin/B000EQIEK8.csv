8113393,2,B000EQIEK8,"I purchased (1) Cycle Reebok: Foundations and Interval Training with Robert Sherman, (2) Mindy Mylrea's Super Cycle: The Best Ride in Town and (3) Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVD #12 Oregon at the same time. I have been very happy with the first two, and plan on selling the Oregon DVD shortly.

Robert Sherman's DVD is very focused on building strength and skill while maintaining control. He does have the intense, almost cheesy persona that others wrote about, but I find that I really like that. It helps me stay in his game, like he's always trying to hang on to you mentally. Robert talks a lot about staying internally focused, and makes it all about you and your experience. It's meditative in a way - he asks you to close your eyes, envision your body, stuff like that. My maximum heart rate is around 180, and with his workouts, I generally find myself in the 155-165 range, reaching 175 during the last set. He gives regular opportunities to recover and stretch.

Mindy Mylrea takes a different approach. Instead of the internal focus, she is very external - you are trying to catch up with a friend, pass a professional cycler and then run from a big dog. She keeps my heart range in the 165-175, with an occasion 180+. She keeps you running for longer intervals, and gives less recovery overall. She is very upbeat and smiley. I find both Mindy and Robert offer a likeable, valuable workout. Neither has great music, but I don't find myself noticing that very much.

Finally, I don't care much for the Oregon DVD. The music is classic and instrumental, though you could mute that and listen to your own stuff. The ride is pretty, but there's no real sense of hill climbing or speed. You completely have to make it up yourself. Also, sometimes you are sort of going uphill and then you switch to a different part of the road with no clear transition. I would rather spend my time watching DVD's of TV series I like than watch this while cycling.",1239321600,2,1951,4.584527220630372
8113394,5,B000EQIEK8,I was getting so bored spinning alone. I purchased this bike-o-vison DVD-muted the volume and blasted my spin music---My heart rate stayed up to fat-burning zone and I did not even realize it as I focused on traveling in Oregon! I love the fall foliage. GREAT JOB BoV!,1164412800,9,268,4.604166666666667
