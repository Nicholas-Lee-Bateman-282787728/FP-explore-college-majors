8071997,5,B000A17CUK,"Very good show

This dvd reissue has the odd bonus track than the earlier video release (like Trams of Old London and so forth)

The encore is a hoot, what with the Bee Gees (of all things) being tackled (oof!)

Fans of Grant and Robyn will find this a joy. A good selection of songs (nice to hear ""Honey Don't Think"" again)

This was filmed in Seattle, so (God help us) ""Viva Seatec!"" had to be played

And there you be
