8473153,5,B000ICMEZ4,Common Sense approach with great insight This DVD is great for what it is.  He gives information which is sometimes overlooked or learned the hardway.  Great suggestions and can speed up your practice time.  He doesn't teach much on what to play but rather how to play effectively.,1386115200,,281,4.8125
8473154,2,B000ICMEZ4,"I have both Jerry Douglas' and Rob Ikes' DVD tutorial systems. They both come with tabs that go with the lessons. This one had virtually nothing during the video and no printable tabs at all.
Other than Phill telling about how he has his dobro mic'ing set up and what picks etc. he uses there is nearly nothing here that would make it worth promoting.
VERY dissapointed! Phill is a great player but this is not a good training DVD.
I feel that was a waste of my time and money.
