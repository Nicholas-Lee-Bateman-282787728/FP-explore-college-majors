8641980,1,B00IGFBUX2,"It is hard to take this video seriously when the guy keeps smacking the tip of his pole into the water, Do you even fish?  This video is more about look at the big fish I caught. I think that this video exists only there because it was a way to write off a fishing trip.",1442275200,,270,3.8214285714285716
8641981,1,B00IGFBUX2,Lance Eagan is obviously a nice fellow and a skilled angler but while watching this DVD there were several areas which dealt very superficially with the subject. For instance when discussing a deep water set-up he shows us his leader which is tied with two nymphs on droppers and split shot on the bottom. He neglects to even mention the fact that he is using a dropper system or how to tie one and also excludes any discussion of tippet size or type. Either this was edited with little thought or poorly put together but either way it amounts to just watching a guy fishing and talking about what most average anglers already know with almost zero new or enlightening information.,1426723200,,681,4.636363636363637
8641982,3,B00IGFBUX2,Not as detailed as I had hoped. Should have had list of tips after each demo.,1426377600,,77,3.875
8641983,4,B00IGFBUX2,"Good video, shows the fundamentals, however, I was looking for a video that does not measure a river width in yards like almost all videos I have seen, I was looking for nymphing techniques in smaller streams.  Seems like all these videos are always shot out west where the rivers are 100+ yards wide.  Otherwise, it does have a lot of good content for the beginner.",1404518400,,366,4.53030303030303
