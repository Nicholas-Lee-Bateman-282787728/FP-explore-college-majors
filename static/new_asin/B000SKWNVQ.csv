8205721,5,B000SKWNVQ,"""More Doomsday Tech"" begins with a hypothetical killer asteroid headed towards earth in 2012 with the destructive power of all the nuclear weapons on earth, causing mass extinction.  About 1,100 asteroids with a 1 km. diameter or larger are near earth.  Now a new NASA group watches 20,000 asteroids/night and analyzes their orbits.  The good news is that none so far have proven threatening; the bad news is that about 30% of the skies (mostly in the Southern Hemisphere) have not yet been surveyed.  Potential defenses include attaching a rocket thruster or solar said - both would required building a base upon the asteroid.  More realistic would be the use of moon-based lasers to push the asteroid off course.

Then its off to biological warfare - eg. anthrax spores treated with an electrostatic charge to repel each other and readily disperse.  Ebola and smallpox are other serious threats, possibly more serious because unlike anthrax, they can spread from one human to another.  Terrorists could infect themselves and then travel quickly through an area using its airlines.  Soviet and U.S. labs both contain considerable quantities of these materials; further they was created antibiotic-resistant forms of plague and the 1918-19 Spanish Flu - the world's greatest killer.  American response would include vaccines etc. pre-positioned in secret locations.

Another worry is a high-tech famine - engineered food seeds leading to unplanned and delayed severe reaction in humans.

""Doomsday Tech"" ends with a less than chilling chapter on cyber terror.  Though experts claimed prevention is not totally possible, the film then featured new technology - quantum cryptography - that promised just that.  Further, no credible potential cyber-disaster was portrayed.",1220486400,,1769,5.385454545454546
