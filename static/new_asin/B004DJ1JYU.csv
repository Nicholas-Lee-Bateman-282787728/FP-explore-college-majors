4332576,3,B004DJ1JYU,"I thought Death Tube 1 was ok and I felt the same with part 2. Nothing really different with part 2 from part 1, just a new group of characters to partake in the cruel and illegal games of death, made out to the public through internet viewing. The kills are of course different from part 1 like it should be. I love asian horror and both Death Tubes are good to own for any asian horror fan.",1421020800,,392,4.038461538461538
8425375,5,B004DJ1JYU,"DEATH TUBE 2 is a sequel to the low budget Japanese SAW/GRUDGE inspired madness about a group of unwilling contestants in a murder game being streamed for Internet viewing. I loved the first movie, and this was even better., An inventive bit of choreographed teddy bear dancing to a Michael Jackson remix, don't want to spoil any more. See it",1523836800,,342,4.716666666666667
