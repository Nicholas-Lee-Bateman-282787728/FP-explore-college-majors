8720634,3,B00ZQ4V8NI,"This video is very disappointing in that it does not really explain new thought concepts very well at all.  It's mostly just people telling their stories of how they came to new thought without really explaining what it is.  I've been studying new thought principles for several years now, and I was really excited to find a video to show to friends and family that would explain it all  - but this is definitely not it.",1531872000,,420,4.5
8720635,2,B00ZQ4V8NI,"Seemed like an infomercial. Gave up after 30 minutes, never want to hear ""New Thought"" again.",1528502400,,93,4.875
8720636,2,B00ZQ4V8NI,I thought this film pushed a cult-like agenda. IMO: actually quite dangerous to substitute mysticism for science.,1514419200,,113,5.705882352941177
8720637,3,B00ZQ4V8NI,"While I generally agree that many problems are psychosomatic and may be cured spiritualy, I just did not like the presentation. Very repetitive, different people keep telling same things in slightly different ways, but there was no specific or valuable information. Also, promote the book ""Secret"" that I personaly think brings more harm than good.",1511222400,2,348,5.345454545454546
8720638,3,B00ZQ4V8NI,"Not as ""new thought"" as I thought. Seemed to be a bit ""sales pitchy"" with a particular company throughout DVD. With that said, there are some insights one could gain from some of the content of this DVD.",1501718400,7,203,4.368421052631579

8720641,5,B00ZQ4V8NI,"This is a well made and uplifting documentary, but it wasn't just inspirational or educational.  There were practical tools and tangible practices offered that can make a difference in the real outcomes of those who take the time to watch it.",1435708800,4,242,4.902439024390244
