Cons: No Queen music is featured, boring for non-Queen fans

From Mark McLaughlin, who had brought us other documentaries like Van Halen: The Early Years and Look up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman, we also receive an hour long chronological look of the beginnings and rise of Classic Rock legends Queen. Released in 2004 with a slew of other unofficial Queen documentaries, while Becoming Queen surely had the most appealing DVD cover art of the bunch, I'm not so sure the program stands out from the crowd.

 This documentary tells the story from the very beginnings through a main narration by Carlos Larkin and archived band interviews and new interviews from friends of Queen, and other people who had either known the band members or in the business.

 Little info about Freddie Mercury's previous bands Ibex and Wreckage mostly due to the fact that they have never attained that level of professionally recording any of their music. Becoming Queen provides interviews with Ken Testi and Mike Bersin who are two out of the three original members of Ibex and Wreckage. They tell the story of how their band was really second choice for lead singer Freddie Mercury because he was campaigning himself to become singer of another band, Smile at the time.

Smile was the band of his friend Tim Staffell, who had played bass and sand lead for the group. Smile was also a trio, and in addition to Staffell, there was guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, two future members of Queen. This documentary also features a new interview with Tim Staffell, who effectively illustrates how the stars slowly aligned to bring the band we know as Queen together in those early days in the late 1960s.

 The hour long documentary focuses more than the first half hour of how the band did in fact become Queen. Through meshing of bands, a couple of personnel changes and heavy gigging. The recording history of the band and the huge global success they had achieved was very condensed and sort of glossed over with just a couple of stories here and there from others like J.J. Jackson who was one of the original MTV VJs, who had interviewed Freddie Mercury and the band in 1983. Of course there was some more detail with the recording of Bohemian Rhapsody and the A Night at the Opera album.

 Yet having said this, it should be noted that this DVD had no license to include original Queen Music. Instead there are snippets here and there of generic rock music to accent the documentary. To have the music of Queen would have better illustrated the story and in my opinion was missed. There is only one Queen performance heard which was Tavaszi Szel, a traditional Hungarian folk song during one of their shows from 1986.

 The inclusion of Queen's album cover art and rare pictures of the band performing was a nice touch and helped tell the story. Others that were interviewed were Mike Read who is mostly known as one of the hosts of the British TV show, Top of the Pops. There is also Doug Puddifoot, a photographer who took pictures of the band even before bass player John Deacon joined the group.

 The DVD features two bonus features. The first is a Photo Album of many rare Queen photos, all were used during the documentary, but here they are all lumped into one slideshow while listening to the monotonous DVD theme music.
 The other ""bonus feature"" is an advertisement of Brian May's signature guitar series. This is an odd choice for a bonus feature.

 This DVD is mainly for Queen fans, I think others would fall asleep understandably. For the Queen fanatic, I do not see any reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to add this to their collection. Don't let the fact that Freddie Mercury's name is misspelled on the front cover as ""Freddy"", this DVD is pretty good.",1452124800,2,4107,4.625690607734807

2020183,5,B0001NIUWG,"There rise to the top wasn't easy and the struggles are documented here in this story ....I enjoyed it - I wasn't expecting a concert with videos of them singing/playing/entertaining - and it is not that at all -- it is a documentary .. loved it.

I believe in fate and Queen and our beloved ""Freddie Mercury"" were meant to be starts!",1344297600,,334,4.387096774193548
2020184,1,B0001NIUWG,"I cannot understand why some of the other reviewers gave more than 1 star to that crappy documentary. There is No queen music at all, and it's soooo soooo kitschy. A non-queen fan would start to laugh by watching freddie moving all the time like 'the number one fag' in the interface menus. It's not a representation of queen at all. Very poor and disapointing. Worst queen documentary ever. Don't buy it",1128729600,5,404,4.625
2020185,2,B0001NIUWG,"It's surprising that I even gave this two stars without it having even a tiny snippet of Queen music.  While I am a huge Queen fan, I  would be embarrassed watching it with someone who did not know what they sound like. But with that said, there were some positives to be found in this somewhat odd documentary.

I was very impressed with the time spent discussing the previous endeavors of the band members (love that baby picture of Freddie Mercury).  Good interviews with their ex-bandmates as well.  But when the focus turned to Queen, I think it fell apart at the seams.  It moved too quickly through the band's later albums.  The biggest problem, however, is it became more of a biography on Freddie Mercury.  It was all Freddie this, Freddie that, etc., etc.  Rather than talk about one of their biggest albums, ""The Game"", the documentary chose to talk about how Freddie changed his image at the time of the album.  In fact, at that point in the documentary, you would be hard pressed to gain an iota of information on any of the other band members.  John Deacon, who wrote a #1 song for them in the 1980's (""Another One Bites the Dust"") was barely mentioned in the entire documentary.

I would have really liked to have learned more about the other members of the band.  After all, the documentary starts out by saying that each member was very integral to the success of Queen.  But you would never know that from watching this documentary.",1125878400,13,1450,4.569767441860465
2020186,5,B0001NIUWG,"I agree with the other two reviews here but I have to upgrade the stars because although it contains no Queen music, this documentary goes into wonderful depth of the often glossed over pre-Queen years of Smile, Ibex and other bands. There are in-depth interviews with people who were there and they have a unique perspective on the personalities of this amazing band. This is not a typical unauthorized quickie, but a well produced documentary giving a unique angle on the history of the band. There are also lots of great archival interviews with the band members. I was touched by this film as it reminded me of the incredible legacy of Freddie Mercury.",1099526400,10,656,4.7631578947368425
2020187,3,B0001NIUWG,"I picked up this DVD as I am a longtime Queen fan. While the overall product was ""good"", the first thing I realized is that there was ZERO Queen or Smile music on the disc. Instead, there was a quasi-soundtrack with someone playing riffs (loosely) in the style of Brian May's sound. I'm sure it's because it's an unauthorized bio, and the producers probably would have been sued if they used the official recordings. For anyone who was looking for classic or previously unreleased live concert clips, this is not the disc for you. It is however, an excellent documentary on the pre-Queen days with Tim Staffel and the members of Freddie's band Ibex, and it shows the determination of the members of Queen to become the stars they eventually became.",1099526400,9,748,4.717557251908397
2020188,5,B0001NIUWG,"Wasn't expecting this ""unauthorized"" Queen DVD to be as good as It really is.  Nothing spectacular, yet interesting.  Talks about where each of the guys come from, then as Smile....and so on and so on.  Many interesting people interviewed on this DVD.  Including Tim Staffel, Ibex members, and etc...I just received this in the mail a few hours ago...and just finished watching it.  I could watch it once again.  I think it's puts into perspective just how big Queen really is..and will always be.  Especially Freddie's always knowing behavior or what the right thing to do was....and we all know now just how correct he was!  Of course I'm still sitting here wanting more and more info and more to watch about Queen and Freddie.  But for a quick $16.00 or so....I now feel special as to having this DVD.  I think any Queen fan could and would appreciate this one.  I now feel that much closer to Queen as a fan and will always love Queen for what they have done and what they are continually doing.  This is from a young 21 year old Queen fan.  This DVD is essential to any true Queen collector or fan!!!",1087344000,28,1105,4.492462311557789
2020219,2,B0001NIUWG,"I was dissapointed in that they didn't show any of queens ""live"" performances or even play any of their music.  They must not of had the rights. This was really a documentary of where each member group up and how the band was formed.",1484092800,,233,4.295454545454546

2020254,3,B0001NIUWG,"The ""Becoming Queen"" is probably the perfect name for this documentary because it completely blows by the bulk of the time these band members were actually Queen. The focus of the documentary is the formative years, when Brian, Roger and Freddie were in different bands, such as Smile and Ibex/Wreckage. The stories are told in interviews with other former members of those bands, as they discuss the moving parts of all their bands and their relationships and how that all ultimately led up Brian, Roger, Freddie and ultimately, John forming Queen. This could probably be an interesting story, if the presentation was a bit more exciting. It is basically a bunch of old still photos with effects and motion added to them, interspersed with talking head interviews, all underlaid with a pretty stock sounding music bed. There's no actual Queen music to be found on this video. The first half of the documentary is the buildup to the actual formation of Queen. Then it's about 15 minutes of light speed travel through the entire history of Queen. Then wraps up with 15 minutes of Freddie, his death, his tribute concert and their legacy. Most of the video featuring Queen is lifted from other common sources that are easily found in better Queen docs, and there isn't much of that. I love Queen, but ultimately, this documentary was boring for me. I've seen more entertaining and informative documentaries on Queen that only ran 30 minutes on VH1 Classics. If I had paid for a DVD of this, I would've gone with 2 stars due to the waste of money. But since it was already included in my Prime membership, I went 3 stars, since all that costed me was an hour of my time.",1466035200,,1667,4.69283276450512

8015268,4,B0001NIUWG,"True to its title, Becoming Queen gives a pretty thorough overview of the individual band members' early years as musicians. There is a good amount of interview footage with Tim Staffel and the band members of Ibex/Wreckage, and history of Smile, which I enjoyed. Some of the video effects were kind of cheesy, and discussion of the bands' later years felt like a re-hash of information that's been covered elsewhere. Never the less I felt it was worth the buck I paid to watch it.",1511481600,,481,4.670588235294118
8015269,3,B0001NIUWG,I  would have given it a 5 but there is no music in this  documentary.  It gets a 3 because it is  very informative and has good background on each  band member and tells a good story of the evolution of  the band.  But NO MUSIC.... And no interviews with the band..,1511308800,,266,4.0

8015271,2,B0001NIUWG,no Queen music - no real interviews with the band. Just a lot of talk from people who aren't queen who maybe knew them at some time. Who knows. Why even make this if you couldn't get the music? What a waste of time.,1506297600,,215,3.909090909090909
8015272,2,B0001NIUWG,Would have been better if there were some Queen songs in it! Their songs were mentioned but then just more jabbering. I'm guessing the producers of this documentary didn't want to pay Queen's licensing fees.,1500595200,,207,4.942857142857143
