8630623,5,B00H7PO9FI,I bought this dvd for a friend who is wants to start cutting his own deer. I thought I'd watch it to learn something from a professional meat cutter. I decided to keep this copy and get another for my buddy. I learned to cut from my parents and have been doing it over 30yrs. What a difference it makes to watch a pro do it. He does a very good job of showing and explaining. Im telling everyone that hunts that they should buy this dvd.,1448841600,,437,4.0344827586206895

8630625,3,B00H7PO9FI,"Most of the cutting is done on stainless countertops, which most hunters don't happen to have in their garages. I do most of my cuts while the animal is hanging by the hind legs. So not really for me. I have a large cutting board for cutting the quarters.",1419811200,,255,4.224489795918367
