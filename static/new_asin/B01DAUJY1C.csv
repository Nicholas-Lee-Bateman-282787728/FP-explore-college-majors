7710606,2,B01DAUJY1C,"A lot of explaining about moves (good). Demonstrations  mirror image and quick, making it hard to learn (bad).",1467676800,3,110,5.111111111111111
7710607,5,B01DAUJY1C,"Another excellent tai chi instructional video by Master Helen Liang.  The lighting and camera work on both the interior and exterior sequences are excellent, making it easy to see details and subtleties of the form.  The instructional style is relaxed and conversational, making you feel like you are getting a personal lesson.  Along with front and rear views of the complete form there is a narrated walkthrough, an excellent fundamentals section, and detailed (but not tedious) step-by-step instruction.

The 48 is new for me and not a form I had planned to learn.  But Master Liang's demonstration and instruction have intrigued me: this is a very interesting and complex form and I intend to take it on.  Learning forms from a video is never easy but the layout and format of this one make it much easier.  But, even if you aren't interested in learning the entire 48, the form contains many common tai chi movements and this video is, in my opinion, an excellent supplement to any tai chi practitioner's library.  Master Liang's interpretations and explanations will enhance your practice, whatever your style.",1466899200,2,1116,5.0271739130434785
7710608,5,B01DAUJY1C,"Master Liang's Tai Chi video is another excellent presentation for students and instructors of Tai Chi and the Chinese martial arts.  The movements are clearly demonstrated and excellent verbal discussion is provided.  This video is excellent for review of Tai Chi Class material and practice and at the same time provides an outstanding instructional video that can easily used to learn Tai Chi from both as a review of class material or to learn from when a Tai Chi Class/Instructor is not available.  This video goes beyond earlier martial arts videos (Tai Chi, Bagua Zhang, Liu He Ba Fa,...)  that  had more demonstration and less verbal explanation of the individual movements.  Master  Helen Liang is both an outstanding practitioner as well as a master level teacher.  This DVD is highly recommended to all martial arts practitioners at all levels.  5 STARS +",1465776000,3,866,5.042253521126761
7710609,2,B01DAUJY1C,"I was advised to try Tai Chi for balance and inner ear issues.  Reading the description, I thought it would be more of a step-by-step lesson building into a routine. Helen explained right off the bat, that this is the more complicated form.  It can take 8-10 months to learn.  It wasn't what I expected. However, she appears to be extremely knowledgeable in the craft. Her movements were hypnotic.  It just wasn't a good fit for me. I'm going to try one that is specifically for balance issues.  However, I think it would be a great video for others who want to learn the more complicated form.",1465171200,8,594,4.514018691588785
7710610,5,B01DAUJY1C,"Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners-48 Form is an excellent and natural complement to Miss Liang's 24 Form DVD. As an instructor, Miss Liang describes and demonstrates the forms in an elegant and beautiful manner. She explains that once learned, the entire exercise can be performed in ten minutes.

Miss Liang shows a walk-through of the forms while teaching each separate movement in easy to follow manner. In separate chapters, she gives the basic guidelines and explanations of the body movements all the while discussing Chi energy, Yin Yang meanings, and the spiritual meaning of Tai Chi.

There are slow motion demonstrations as well as real time movements. Which I also found helpful was the demonstration shown by the rear and other angles of each form. The movements are taught in sections and should be learned by slow but sure practice. The instructor advises that the first 24 movement should be learned and then the the next 24 movements can be added on for a full and total Tai Chi experience.

In conclusion, this DVD presents more challenging and bit more difficult movements compared to the first DVD. However, the rewards to be gained after a period of time are invaluable. This DVD is well worth owning and a valuable tool for learning the art of Tai Chi.",1463184000,12,1272,4.852534562211981
7710611,5,B01DAUJY1C,"The graceful, flowing, effortless moves in tai chi are beginning to attract American attentions. Schools promising to teach tai chi are cropping up throughout the nation, showing up even in adult living centers. Helen Liang, eldest daughter of Grandmaster Liang, vice-president of the the Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute in Canada, and cancer survivor, has recently teamed up with Yangs Martial Arts Association to produce a 180 minute DVD for level 1 students, Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners: Learn the 48 Form.

In this DVD, Liang introduces this tai chi form, describing how it is mainly drawn from the Yang style, while including steps from Chin, Wu, Hao and Sun. Then she demonstrates the complete form with elegant ease and supple simplicity. Next she does a walk-through of the 48 positions and covers some basic guidelines. After this she delicately and descriptively takes the tai chi learner through six instructions that cover all 48 positions.  Afterwards she completes the form again showing how it looks from behind her back. Finally, she concludes the video with some words of encouragement.

Beyond the thoroughness of Liangs presentation, there are two other items that stood out. First, as she walks the student through each section of the form, she regularly brings out their martial application; how this move is a punch, that one is a block, why this fist is hidden before it strikes, and so forth. Second, is the intensity of the form. It becomes quickly obvious to the astute viewer that this simplified tai chi  48 form has so many moving parts that it will take weeks and months to learn it, and come to practice it well. And in the concluding remarks Liang makes sure to mention that it will likely take nine to 12 months to get this form down.

Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners: Learn the 48 Form is an easy-to-follow DVD. Liangs patient teaching manner will make this video accessible to most pupils. The martial applications will thrill martial arts enthusiasts, while the discipline and fitness aspects will please those desiring its health benefits. If you're ready to move up from the 24 position form of tai chi, this is the video to get.

Thanks to YMAA for providing, upon my request, the free copy of Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners  Learn the 48 Form used for this review. The assessments are mine given without restrictions or requirements (as per Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255).",1461283200,16,2444,4.931873479318734
7710612,5,B01DAUJY1C,"This is the first review where I have ever given a DVD all FIVE stars. There are two primary reasons for this -
1. It is an excellent tutorial/training aid for anyone wanting to learn this form for health and fitness.
2. Ms. Liang's previous DVD on the 24 Simplified form, which I had reservations about regarding its martial applications content (see my review of her Simplified 24 Form DVD) has set the precedent for what her tutorials contain, so there should be no surprises for anyone who takes the time to check out her work. In other words, if you look up reviews of her previous DVDs, you should know what to expect - an excellent intro to tai chi for fitness.

The format is, again, pretty much perfect. The DVD has several useful demonstrations of the form (decent camera work), two are front views (one with a running commentary as she performs the movements) and a complete demonstration from a rear view. There is a section where she covers fundamentals, basic stances, talks about transitions and weighting, and throughout are various tips to avoid injury through improper musculo-skeletal alignment. The form is then broken into six very detailed section-by-section chapters, with about as much information and detail on the physical movements as you can offer through a DVD.

More than she put into this DVD would likely be going beyond an introduction to this form, and get into areas of training that should advise the assistance of a competent teacher. But there is more than enough here to keep someone busy for quite awhile, I would say.
As I stated about her Simplified Tai Chi 24 Form DVD -
if you are interested n learning this form, or reviewing it, get it.",1460937600,26,1682,4.717687074829932
7710613,5,B01DAUJY1C,Wonderful way to exercise.  Can to the easy move currently and will work way up to more difficult ones.,1475539200,3,103,4.421052631578948

Thank you. Stephon.",1473120000,2,116,5.5
7710615,5,B01DAUJY1C,Very nicely done with good explanations and demonstrations. I am using this at least once per week to help me develop myself in the 48 movement routine.,1472515200,,152,4.666666666666667

7710617,5,B01DAUJY1C,"I enjoyed her DVDs on Tai-Chi  it is very thorough  but this form is not for beginners I work recommend her 24 Form first, this also called the Beijing form.  the 48 Posture form is a Combination form used for more exercised and  competition.  I enjoy watching her perform both forms, she is vey graceful.  Again if you are just getting started check out either 8, 13 or 24 form tai-chi before trying to tackle this form.

If you are ready for the 48 posture then give this video a try she is a great instructor The only then I wish the video has was reference lines to hel tell the ordination.",1471478400,8,594,4.25
7710618,5,B01DAUJY1C,"I am deeply moved by Helen's deep and special understanding about Taichi.
You can never image how grand and magnificent the movement could be from this beautiful yound lady! What Helen performs out is not only movement, but also the Qi, energy,  Yin and Yang, open and close.
Helen and her teammate is not only very good Taichi performers, but also very good Taichi teachers. It is from them that I know and feel the idea ""Taichi is moving meditation"".
Thank you Helen and the team for this wonderful DVD.",1470009600,,505,4.611111111111111

7710621,4,B01DAUJY1C,"I have also watched the 24 form by Helen Liang and I can say I really enjoy the way she teaches. Like her other DVD it is a bit difficult for the beginner but is great for anyone willing to take the time to learn.

My dad is actually very into Tai Chi for the health benefits so I ended up passing this DVD as well as the 24 form on to him as he hadn't really looked into the martial applications. He just finished watching through both DVD's and enjoyed them so now he is going back through them to practice and learn both forms.

So to those who have had some trouble learning with Helen's faster paced teaching, it is doable. My dad is 63 and spends most of his day sitting (He's a Trucker) but by stopping and replaying parts he was able to learn the movements.

Full Disclosure: I received a copy of this DVD in exchange for my unbiased review. The opinions here are my own.",1468540800,,879,4.128654970760234
7710622,5,B01DAUJY1C,"This DVD is very true to its title - it is tai chi for health. Learning and doing the form can bring multiple health benefits for body alignment, stability and balance. Martial applications are mentioned in the demonstration, but they are not the main focus. They are discussed to help with the understanding of each movement. The DVD is divided into useful sections showing the full form (front view and ""walk-through""), general guidelines on posture and stances, instruction on individual movements repeated several times with commentary, and a rear view demonstration. The instructions are very comprehensive, but what I would have appreciated even more is the rear view demonstration with the ""walk-through"" comments on individual movements.

Master Liang often compares the 48 Form tai chi with the 24 Form, and mentions that the 48 Form is longer and more challenging. This one is for the patient, prepared to be learning the form for up to 12 months. This DVD can also be used as a refresher for advanced beginners. I had learned the 48 Form before, but I found some subtle details on this DVD that escaped my attention during the first time.",1468281600,2,1149,4.953367875647668
8755420,5,B01DAUJY1C,"This video is an example of a great way to learn the form.  Helen is awesome in explaining what one should need to participate in this art and self defense system.  In this dvd you will see a demonstration, go over the guide lines (but not too extensively) and will be guided through the form in parts.

Having known Tai Chi 24 first does help with learning the form quickly but it isn't necessary.  The picture quality is good and the training is presented from different angles.  I'd recommend this or any product from YMAA because they provide material everyone can do, they encourage you on your journey no matter what your level is, and if it isn't the starting point of your training they will recommend where you should start.  This is rated beginner so its an great begining to Yang style Tai Chi.",1528848000,,805,4.517241379310345
8755421,5,B01DAUJY1C,"Love, love, love this video. Very easy to follow steps. She is a great teacher and very relaxing to follow. Took maybe 6 months to be able to do the whole 24 steps on my own. Ordered the 48 steps video but that one will be challenging! This video is the easiest way to learn Tai Chi wihout spending a fortune on lessons. Get a cheap full length mirror to put on a couch behind you  length-wise to be able to see TV when turning around.  That is a must to be able to keep up with her when not facing the TV, which happens a lot.  You will not be disappointed with this video!",1525046400,3,574,3.973913043478261

8755427,5,B01DAUJY1C,"By far the best of its kind. While it would help very much to have learned the 10 and 24 forms first, Helen Liang's presentation is clear yet detailed enough that the DVD can be used by anyone. It does take time to learn, even a year honestly, but so does anything worthwhile.

Helen Liang also teaches how different flavors of Tai Chi were integrated into the form, which gives a practitioner many places to go from this DVD. It is marketed as 'for Beginners' and I think that it is true in the sense that it can lead to many things. I wish they would make an app to go along with the DVD, it would help enormously. And as with her other offerings, Helen Liang is an amazingly clear teacher with the perfect mix of grace and discipline, a sheer pleasure to watch and learn from.",1505952000,,779,4.263513513513513
