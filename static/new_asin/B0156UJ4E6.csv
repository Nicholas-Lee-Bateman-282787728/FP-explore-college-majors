8732852,5,B0156UJ4E6,"We are using this DVD set in a study for parents who have students in CCD classes... I can not say enough good about it! I have borrowed it from my Parish numerous times just to renew the information on the Mass.  Very easy to follow, humorous delivery in some spots, great cinematic production, it truly opened the door for me understanding the Mass on a deeper level.  Things I didn't know, realize or had been taught at some point.  Highly worth it for RCIA, adult study, and those struggling with Mass being ""routine"" or ""boring.""",1452297600,7,534,4.541666666666667
