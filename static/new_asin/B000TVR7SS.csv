8211163,1,B000TVR7SS,"This was a pointless waste of effort. Two solid hours of re-enactors marching around and firing flintlock muskets with black powder, showing off antique re-creations of 18th Century uniforms.  No narration, no explanation of the battles. I feel totally ripped off.",1377734400,4,264,5.439024390243903
8211164,5,B000TVR7SS,The bad reviews on a independent docudrama company shows how picky people are. This film doesn't have a several hundred thousand dollar budget like the History Channel shows have. That said as a Civil War Reenactor I love and appreciate this film. The problem of being staged like some complain about is due to reenactments have 10x less men than the actual battle. If not staged everyone would die and it would be over in a few minutes.,1361750400,,437,4.615384615384615
8211165,2,B000TVR7SS,"Was excited to get a video on Yorktown! However, I was very much disappointed when I watched the video and it is poorly done. There was information on the engagement and siege but the video is very disjointed - using reenactors - and not edited to show a very cohesive story. Some of the video shows engagements with units that did not happen.  Also - with the use of reenactors - the whole thing is like another reenactor filmed it and did no editing.  The footage drags on alot and for no reason.  At least 25 minutes of footage could have been cut to make a better video.  Maps of the siege would have helped alot as well as more information on the geography and commmanders would have been beneficial. This looks like a video that was done with very little editing. Very amateurish and very disappointing - much like the battle of Cooch's bridge one.  Great if you are a reenactor or was one that participated in these reenactments, but otherwise, not worth much at all.",1333324800,,974,4.480225988700565
8211166,1,B000TVR7SS,"I bought this hoping that it would be an additional source of information about the Battle of Yorktown.  However, upon watching it, the producers forgot that this is a time of ""sound"" in pictures and not the ""silent picture"" period of time.  After about 5 minutes of watching it I was bored to death!  Don't waste your time and money buying this DVD as it doesn't even work as a paperweight!",1243728000,2,391,4.47887323943662
8211167,2,B000TVR7SS,"I had expected this to have some narration, but it's just the marching and battling. That's not terrible, I guess, and as a reenactor myself, it's fun to watch, but two hours of it gets a little stale. I could watch a couple of excerpts on Youtube and get the same thing.

Buy it if you'd like to watch combat and don't care that you have no idea what's going on. For me, it's good to watch for the drill (and see if I can spot people I know). But, in the end, I would have liked something a little more educational.

Also, from a technical standpoint, the text that precedes each battle is difficult to read. I have an HDTV, maybe it's not meant for HD.",1242172800,2,654,4.141732283464567
8211168,5,B000TVR7SS,"A good DVD, this shows the Battle of Yorktown, using the 225th reenactment, as it says clearly on the cover and the description for anyone who missed it. This is not a movie, or a program on the History Channel; if so, it would have been a lot worse. This offers the audience a look at what happened during the battle, giving an idea of the real time and feel. If you want cliff notes to the battle with someone feeding you information and praising America's struggle against tyranny with an orchestra in the background, go to the less than perfect History Channel. If you want a much deeper look at the Battle of Yorktown specifically, then this is perfect. For the other comment on this product, clearly, the person had no idea what they were talking about.",1229558400,,759,4.507246376811594
8211169,1,B000TVR7SS,"This is a very bad DVD and a waste of money.  It contains primarily marching, and the battle scenes are OBVIOUSLY staged.  The photos posted on Amazon are very misleading, as they have been very carefully selected.  I bought this DVD because I wanted one that showed and described the final battle  between the American Patriots and the British in the Revolutionary War,  but I did not get that.  As I said earlier, it contains primarily marching scenes on surrender field.  Even the British surrender is not well presented.  DON'T BUY IT.",1222992000,,539,4.782608695652174
