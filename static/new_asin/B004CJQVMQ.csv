There are 20 episodes of Betty's first two TV series: ""Life with Elizabeth"" (1953-55) and ""A Date with the Angels"" (1957-58).  These shows are probably not very memorable to some people, especially the latter, but, for avid fans, they will be a joy to watch.

There are 10 episodes of each show on each disc, making 20 episodes in all.  The quality isn't the best, especially for ""Life with Elizabeth"".  But, for the age of the shows, it's better than you might expect, for shows in the public domain.

If you're able to find this set in Target, or any store, grab it.  They sell fast.  When I called Target to ask if they had this item in stock, they had six.  This was around 9:00 PM.  The next day when I went, there was only one left.  Betty is on fire this year!",1299456000,6,996,4.262032085561497
