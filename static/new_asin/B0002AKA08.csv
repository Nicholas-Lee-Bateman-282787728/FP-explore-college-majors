8025239,4,B0002AKA08,"This VHS tape gives us about two hours of some of the funniest moments from very early black & white TV, introduced by ""Uncle Miltie"" himself.  These are from the Texaco show as listed, not from later Berle programs, like other product available.  If you're old enough to remember the shows when originally broadcast, you'll be a kid again for those two hours.",1437091200,,360,4.698412698412699
