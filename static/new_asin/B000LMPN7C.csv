8162248,2,B000LMPN7C,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and I knew he did a cameo in this film. He appears at the beginning of the film to introduce it. That part was done very candidly. It was fun to see him. During the film, Shah Rukh Khan's name was mentioned once or twice. The film itself leaves much to be desired. It was tedious for me to watch (I was only watching it to look for Shah Rukh Khan). I don't recommend this film.",1334880000,,433,3.8764044943820224
8162249,3,B000LMPN7C,"GUDGUDEE has a very funny plot that sadly enough begins to sag in the middle. The movie runs purely on the acting of Anupam Kher and the dazzling Pratibha. She is truley spectacular and has a flair for comedy. She also looks very beautiful throughout the film. Anupam is excellent, as usual and performs very well indeed as an naive and idiotic buisnessman. Jugal Hansraj gives a nice portrayal as a struggling singer who is madly inlove with Pratibha. Bappi Lahiri's music is very nice. Some musibal gems of the movie are ""HAR PAL CHAHE MEA DIL"" and ""BIKHIRI HUI CHANDINI"". The ""MAIN TO PRITAM KO"" sequence is very funny.

This film is watchable for its performances and music.",1304640000,,678,4.697478991596639
