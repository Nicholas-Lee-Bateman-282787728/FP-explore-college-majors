7089978,4,B00VGXKNTS,"Simply loved it.  Can't believe it was cancelled.  The action was really ramped up for the second season and much more of Wendy (always a good thing).  Only downside is that many questions have remained unanswered.  How come Frederick never aged in Asgard? What's with the two brothers being reborn or having no idea that their mother was a witch (who also never aged beyond 50, yet Dash and his brother do or do they?) And I never find out what Raven is up to or the implications of meeting Helena and meanings of traveller, bridge and dagger. I need another series!",1446076800,,567,4.529411764705882

7089994,5,B00VGXKNTS,"Loved the Witches of East End and was so sorry it was cancelled after this second season. I don't think it ever found its audience. I have a few actual props from the series and when I told my daughters about them, neither of them had heard of the series :( which might explain its cancellation. Oh well, whether you are buying this to relive the episode, or are new to this little gem of a series; I strongly urge you to buy the series on DVD; the woman are all gorgeous, the men quite handsome, and the goings-on are mysterious & intriguing.",1441238400,3,543,4.281553398058253

7090012,1,B00VGXKNTS,We loved Season I but didn't like Season 2 at all. I can see why this is the last season. They needed to bring in the clowns more and stop with the constant high pitched action adventure. We grew bored but kept watching because we had bought the season and felt an obligation to continue watching it. We realized we should have saved our time and watched a better show or read a book.,1439164800,,384,4.202702702702703
7090013,5,B00VGXKNTS,A wonderful show about family and witchcraft.  This series brings a new twist to the story of how witches came to be and the challenges that they face.

7090018,4,B00VGXKNTS,Loved this show. I was devastated when it was cancelled. The only thing I hate about this box set is the absence of deleted scenes and any other extras. You are basically paying for the 13 episodes and that's it. Nothing else.,1437177600,6,226,4.404761904761905

I agree with the other review and hope another network is able to pick this series up and give it the run it deserves.",1433980800,3,396,4.293333333333333
7090024,3,B00VGXKNTS,"PROs
 Season 2 was just plain better than season 1, although some viewers left the show because it got ""too dark"". I'm glad WoEE wasn't afraid to depart into darker territory rather than turning into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched/dp/B00DXLO086/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched</a>.
 The addition of James Marsters (Spike from Buffy/Angel) as Tarkoff in ep 7 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-of-Darkness/dp/B00MXD8L44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art of Darkness</a>) was a righteous casting choice. Aging&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;fans out there (like me) may appreciate WoEE even more due to Marsters being a recurring character.
 This season the Beauchamp family characters were more comfortable in their skins, and seemingly with one another as actors. It's more apparent than ever that Mdchen Amick  was born for this role; Rachel Boston makes a strong showing as well.
 I'm a vampire cognoscente, but WoEE and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salem/dp/B00NPF03IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salem</a>&nbsp;have caused me to keep an eye out for more witch serials.
 WoEE features fewer petulant characters than the middling Vampire Diaries, and best of all: no rotten stinkin' werewolves.

CONs
 Despite decent sets and slick production values, WoEE falls well short of an HBO classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood/dp/B00N176ZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood</a>, mostly due to the script.
 I really could have done without the Scarface/disco flashbacks in ep 5 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Knight/dp/B00MB1QZYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Knight</a>).
 No extras or bonus/special features: this is the primary shortcoming of Amazon's CreateSpace DVDs (manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon). On the plus side, ""by eliminating inventory, waste, and inefficiencies in the distribution system, on-demand manufacturing provides the added benefit of helping preserve the environment.""
 Look at the cover art for this DVD: why does it feature our heroines dressed as street corner harlots?
 Still a bit hokey at times, but it kept me coming back. Unfortunately the show got cancelled, so this was the final season ",1433289600,8,2536,7.555932203389831

7090026,5,B00VGXKNTS,"A delightful, mildly trashy show with plenty of heart and a superb cast.
