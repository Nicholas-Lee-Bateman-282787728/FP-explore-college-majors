8559506,5,B00AZ9FI8A,"Small comment:  I've watched many of Andy Stanley's presentations on the internet and after seeing some of his earlier material (for example, best question earlier) to his more recent ones thing is clear:  the man has grown in his ability to hold an audience to the point where there is nobody, and I mean nobody, better at it than he is.  The guy is funny, compelling, and insightful in a way that both Christians and non-Christians alike will appreciate.

And what do we have here?  No less than perhaps the most difficult of topics in any setting:  an open invitation to actually READ the Bible (horrors!).  Non-threating, non-judgemental, and compelling in a simple presentation, Andy Stanley provides a compelling case for at least cracking that big old book from time to time and perhaps - perhaps -making it an integral part of your life.

Highly, highly recommended - and I ain't no Baptist either.  Andy, you are a treasure.",1362268800,,933,4.817610062893082
