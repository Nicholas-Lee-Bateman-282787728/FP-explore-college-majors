4934473,4,B00632KSMY,My kids love Scooby Doo. This was a great deal for $6! Lots of episodes on 4 different dvd's. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it can look grainy on new tv's.,1412294400,2,177,3.810810810810811

4934478,5,B00632KSMY,"This set of four discs is the most requested DVD at our house.  I have a bunch of little boys- ages 4-11 who love these.  They are clever and funny, not too scary, but certainly exciting enough to keep everyone entertained.  I think they are better than the classic Scooby-Doo movies.  The writing is far better, and they're particulary fantastic for the age 4-7 crowd.",1379462400,7,369,4.630769230769231

4934518,5,B00632KSMY,"I'm an avid cartoon lover, both younger and older, and scooby doo (all incarnations) are no exception. I buy every collection of my childhood favorites I can (scooby doo where are you?, jonny quest, invader zim, simpsons, and more) I actually ran into this copy of  ""4 Kids Favorites: A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" at my local walmart, and I quickly bought it since I hadn't seen copies of ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo: The Complete 1st Season"" and ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo: The Complete 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Season"" on dvd in a long while. Those I believe are available online now, in comparison to finding them in stores. I was a little concerned when I saw on the cover that it was only 12 episodes, which means it wouldn't be the complete first season. However, in this case looks can be deceiving, you actually get 16 episodes!!! You get the complete first season and the first 3 episodes from Season 2 in this bundle! You get the following episodes....

Season 1
1. A Bicycle Built For Boo!
2. The Sludge Monster from the Earth's Core
3. The Schnook Who Took My Comic Book
4. Wanted Cheddar Alive
5. For Letter or Worse
6. The Babysitter from Beyond
7. Now Museum, Now You Don't
8. Snow Place Like Home
9. Scooby Dude
10. Ghost Who's Coming to Dinner
11. The Story Stick
12. Robopup
13. Lights...Camera...Monster

Season 2.
14. Curse of the Collar
15. The Return of Commander Cool
16. The Spirit of Rock'n Roll

This means you can buy the remaining volumes for cheaper online, or buy ""The Complete  2nd, 3rd, and 4th Season"" online here. Now if you're just getting into the Scooby Doo Universe for your family, A Pup Named Scooby Doo is perfect to add to the collection. You've got Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby as preteens/early teen years. The stories are more silly however, and definitely not as dark or scary as Scooby Doo: Where Are You?! The comedy is more slapstick and the characters provide far more exaggerated emotions. The stories are still fun, and Shaggy still makes the same witty comments. The same level of friendship is also displayed with Shaggy and Scooby. If you're a cartoon nerd like me, this is the last incarnation where the legendary Don Messick voiced Scooby Doo (he was the original voice for Scooby) and the late Casey Kasem was still voicing Shaggy, whereas Fred, Daphne, and Velma were voiced by child actors/actresses back in the 80s. You definitely won't make a mistake in purchasing this bundle. It's fun for everyone of all ages!",1414886400,7,2466,4.595454545454546
