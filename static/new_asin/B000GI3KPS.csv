2613983,5,B000GI3KPS,"This is an excellent teaching DVD.

  What is most impressive is Stefan Grossman's ability to teach.

Cleverly staying in one key at a time, Stefan patiently brings the student not simply a solid background of acoustic blues, but also of small ""tricks"" as he calls them.  These ""tricks"" or short licks, hammers, pull offs, etc, are things taken for granted by Intermediate or Advanced players, but the type of little things that beginners listen to and marvel over.  Stefan generously shares these little, and sometimes quite simple little manuevers that vastly improves the sound of the song.

Stefan also includes original recordings of the songs; some from as early as 1927, and has you listen to the original; sometimes more than one version, before hearing him play, and before breaking the song down for you.

The only negative is that the TAB (which includes all the lyrics) has graphics that are not the easist to read.  But, I could not take away from the 5 stars for that.

I never knew of Stefan's music, which may be a plus in my case.  I am able to view him simply as a teacher.  There are a lot of instructional DVDs out there by talented players who are not talented teachers.  Stefan's easygoing personality is a must.  Why?  In taking DVD lessons (which is my only source of instruction) you spend many hours ""with"" the instructor, as you repeat the lessons over and over.  If the instructor's personality is not your 'cup of tea', you will find that you will learn less, as you subconciously pull away from the time spent.  Conversely, when you enjoy the personality of the teacher, you are inclined to spend more time ""with him"" via DVD; subsequently, learning far more.

Such is the case with Grossman.  Perhaps it is the age and wisdom that comes as the ego no longer seeks rock star adoration from people.  I have had the unpleasant experience of sitting ""before"" an instructor who's talent is amazing, but who's love of himself is so over the top, that I ended up selling the DVDs...perhaps my own weakness, but in conversing with others, I find that others feel the same way.

Enjoy Grossman.  He is not there to tell jokes, nor boast of his past accomplishments (Martin Guitar has built one in his honor, so not much else needs to be said).  Enjoy the personality who seems eager to do one thing:  share his love of acoustic blues.

8132783,3,B000GI3KPS,"From what I have studied so far, this is a good course for solid background on traditional blues covers. The MAIN draw back is the TAB is not standard, like all the other TAB we are used to. It is not impossible, but seems like a silly decision by a great guitar player. Thats it, thanks.",1321574400,,288,4.160714285714286
8132784,5,B000GI3KPS,"After having Grossman's DVD for about 3 weeks, I have to say it is very well done.  I like his teaching style and the bonus material included is great.

If you're used to standard style tabbing, his tabs may throw you a bit, but you can get used to it pretty quickly.  The lessons are definitely not for beginners, and, at least for me will require a lot of practice to play well.

The only negative I can think of is the tab booklet is rather small, so you have to stop quite a bit to get to the next page.  It would be a lot easier if you could download a PDF file and print out the tab.  Other than that I know this will keep me busy for most of the year - I have only gotten through two songs and still have a ways to go to get them polished.",1319328000,2,746,3.843137254901961
