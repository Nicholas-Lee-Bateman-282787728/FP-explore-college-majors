I watch a few more movies than I should and I am glad to say that this was a pleasantly unpredictable edge of my seat ride that found me talking to the TV trying to help the ""bad guys"" get away. An intense love story without all of the mush. White Trash Cinderella and Prince Charming......in the beginning. I saw this movie when I was pretty young and always thought, "" I wish I could find a man who loved me like that"". Luckily, all I had to do was wait a while.

636957,5,6303383378,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

LOVE AND A .45: Genial thief Watty Watts (Bellows) is polite, friendly, and full of down-home country wisdomthe kind of guy who gives the counter clerk career advice while robbing his convenience store. Life is good for him and galpal Starlene (Zellweger)until his speed-snorting partner, Billy Mack (Cochrane) violently fs up a holdup, then turns on Watty, whos got no choice but to incapacitate the psycho, take the money and run.

Things take a turn for the worse when Watty is confronted by sadistic lawman Ranger X, which leads to more gunplay and more trouble. Suddenly, Wattys life is on the poor white trash heap. A road trip to Mexico might not be a bad idea. Then again, with half the cops in Texas, a couple of drug-addled loan sharks, and a really POd Billy on their tail...it might be a *very* bad idea.

Discussion: Its Raising Arizona meets Natural Born Killers: A wacky, violent, bloody gunfest, alternately droll and outrageous; a punky postmodern noir which does for movies like Kalifornia what the Evil Dead and Scream series did for (or to) horror movies; namely, give us bloodshed that is just too over the top to be taken seriously.

Bellows looks like a dissolute Matthew Broderick, and his Watty (a specialist in risk management) believes his granddads folk wisdom that there are only two things you need to get by in life (see the title). Zellweger (in her first major movie role) is a lusty teenage babydoll, playing romantic outlaw lovers on the lam, always keeping an eye out for a Polaroid moment. Together they're sympathetic kids: not evil or even bad, just victims of circumstance. (Were not bloodthirsty killers, Starlene assures a reporter, were just newlyweds.)

Along the way, were treated to a mocking of tabloid TV, and Peter Fonda in a role so weird that it has to be seen (and heard) to be believed. And in the end, Watty and Starlene prove (to Billy, anyway) that death is the biggest trip of all.",1423180800,,2193,4.670984455958549

I do buy some movies because they have some of my favorite actresses in unexpectedly sexy roles. This is one of them. Renee Zellweger is deliberately and lusciously more smokin' in this movie as she was in ""Chicago.""
It is further redeemed by the fact this is an original and  high quality story with charismatic and committed acting.
Nicholas Cage, Woody Harrelson, and Christian Slater with their hot sidekicks Patricia Arquette, Lauren Dern and Juliette Lewis are the charter members of this small but fascinating and enjoyable niche.
Welcome, Gill Bellows, for an acting performance as idiosyncratic and as deliciously nuanced as any of the other more famous Hollywood ""weird boys"" mentioned above.

637197,3,6303383378,"If you like insane characters with no real purpose or intent, than this is a winner. The first thing they taught us in film school was ask yourslef why this movie needs to be made? I'm still searching for the answer to that question here. Other than so good actors needing the work, and someone having money to blow, it never really transcends the unnecessary blood and violence, unreal situations, and poor camera work. Maybe I'm a movie snob or I'm just jaded, but their are alot better ways to spend a few hours than watching this movie.",1366502400,,540,4.520408163265306
637198,3,6303383378,"Quentin Tarantino had an immediate impact on film. Breaking the scene with a bang, his ""Reservoir Dogs"" caught everyone's attention and ushered in a wave of copycats. Some were more successful than others. This outing is very watchable, but its roots are obvious.

Here's the scoop. The I Ching reading Watty Watts (Gil Bellows) robs convenient stores, but he does so with verve and politeness, and never uses a loaded gun. He needs some cash to pay a loan shark for a wedding ring he bought his girl Starlene Cheatham (Renee Zellweger). He hooks up with his bud Billy (Rory Cochrane) for a bigger score that goes way south. Now he and Starlene are on the run from a couple of leg breakers and the cops. Can they make it to safety in Mexico?

This is a really fun watch. It moves at a quick pace, has some snappy dialogue and is directed with a degree of style. The only real problem is that it is such a blatant rip-off of Tarantino. The writer/director C.M. Talkington has only helmed three projects and appears to have fallen off the face of the planet. This seems to have been his best effort. The cast is good. Bellows and Zellweger make a notable couple. Jeff Combs has acted in a lot of projects but this has been the best I've seen him in. The characters all stick out (though some are over the top) and are memorable. The music is pretty good and The Reverend Horton Heat puts in an appearance with his boys playing the house band in a strip club. What's not to like?

This has somewhat of a nasty edge to it in that too many of the characters are way strung out on meth, and all occupy the lower strata of society. How many people can be so cavalier about taking someone's life? That being said, this is still a fun watch. Just know that it wouldn't exist without its notable predecessor.",1365811200,,1798,4.393393393393393

But ... it only plays with Spanish subtitles on and no matter what you do with adjustments (like ""subtitles off"") doesn't change that.  So if you don't mind a bunch of foreign language printing over your movie, this is fine.  If you find this to be an abstraction and own hundreds of Lionsgate DVD's then you have to wonder what's up!",1363651200,,433,4.375

637264,1,6303383378,"I'd love to know what movie Peter Travers was watching when he compared it to 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Drugstore Cowboy' because it sure wasn't this. This film is stupid trying to pass for smart. Two white trash lovers, Watty (Gil Bellows) and Starlene (Renee Zellweger), hightail it to Mexico after Billy (Rory Cochrane), Watty's speed freak ex-partner, blows away a convenience store clerk during a botched robbery. Once across the border the two dine with Starlene's parents (Peter Fonda, speaking through a voice box, is her dad), get hitched by a goofy reverend (David Lynch favorite Jack Nance), and turn into cult heroes thanks to media coverage. Things aren't all sunny for the newlyweds since Billy, who now has an idiotic skull tattoo, is hot on their trail. He even has himself a few new partners (including Stuart Gordon favorite Jeffrey Combs). I thought the film sucked due to bad writing, Cochrane being so obnoxious and over the top and the fact that I never cared about Watty or Starlene. Zellweger is very sexy here, but she made some bad movies at the beginning of her career. (To be fair, she did win an Independent Spirit Award for this film). The only parts of the film I enjoyed featured Wiley Wiggins, Nance, Combs and the short shorts that Zellweger wears. Thanks for nothing Travers.",1239753600,,1306,4.834821428571429

Watching this, I experienced twist after twist, so I never knew which of the underdogs was going to come out on top, or who was going to win this round of the battle for life.  Renee Zellweger will shock the pants off the viewer as a young trailer park resident who turns to a life of serious crime and murder, so she's worth the price of admission alone.",1137196800,,634,4.401709401709402

637367,4,6303383378,"Does anyone else besides me enjoy seeing a big name movie star before they made it big?  While this wasn't Rene Zellweger's first film role, it was certainly the first where she had a starring credit, and certainly a far cry from her more demure character in 1996's Jerry Mcguire.  Love and a .45 (1994), written and directed by Texas native C.M. Talkington (his first writing and directing credit) stars, along with Ms. Zellweger, an early appearance by Gil Bellows (who appeared in a much more famous film the same year titled The Shawshank Redemption and then found a greater degree of fame on the hit FOX television show Ally McBeal), and the ever-entertaining Rory Cochrane, who was once involved with Zellweger, and would later appear with her in Empire Records (1995).  Also appearing are Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator), Jace Alexander (Eight Men Out), Ann Wedgeworth (My Science Project), Michael Bowen (Night of the Comet), and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider).

The movie, set in Texas, features Bellows and Zellweger as Watty Watts and Starlene Cheatham, respectively, as a young couple in love living together in modest, mobile surroundings (a trailer home) with their main source of income being Watty robbing convenience stores every once in awhile, when not studying or quoting philosophically from the I Ching.  Life has been pretty good for the couple, but Starlene has been pushing for Watty to make an honest woman of her, which leads Watty to borrow a large sum of money from an unscrupulous source (loan shark), and now he must contend with two speed-addicted, gun totin' (does everyone in Texas carry a gun?) collection agents in Dinosaur Bob (Combs) and Creepy Cody (Alexander).  Stealing from convenient stores, as you may have figured, while relatively easy, doesn't usually net a large haul, so when Watty's slimy prison buddy Billy Mack Black (Cochrane) comes by with a tip on a large score, Watty sees a chance to get out from under the loan shark's thumb.  Things don't go as planned as a clerk gets killed (Billy Mack broke one of Watty's cardinal rules of never carrying a loaded gun, and he's also seriously addicted to crystal meth, a form of speed that makes one highly unpredictable apparently), Watty and Billy have a falling out (ending with Billy getting a fork stuck in an uncomfortable place).  Watty, fearing legal entanglements (jail) decides to head for Mexico with his new bride Starlene, with Dinosaur Bob, Creepy Cody, and Billy Mack not far behind, two looking for the money owed, and the third looking for revenge.  Oh yeah, Watty and Starlene are now also plastered all over the TV as a state wide hunt by Texas Law enforcement gears up (the clerk who got killed was related to someone high up within the law enforcement community).  Yes, Mexico's looking pretty good for Watty and Starlene, what with three trigger-happy speed freaks and the state of Texas, where the popular form of capital punishment is the electric char, hot on their heels.

I did enjoy this film a lot.  I've noticed others have compared it to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (which came out the same year), and while there are certainly similarities, I believe Love and a .45 stands on its' own without, as another reviewer astutely stated, all the pretension or psychotropic cinematography of Stone's film.  If anything, I would compare it more to David Lynch's Wild at Heart, which came out four years earlier.  I think Talkington did a wonderful job in the writing and directing of his first film, much better than many others' first outings.  Not only did he present fun, engaging, and interesting characters, but he also used the backdrop of Texas well, suggesting an intimate familiarity of a true native of the state (which he is).  Zellweger is terminally cute, suitably trashy, and very dangerous (when Watty is threatened) as Starlene and Bellows' character of the deep thinking Watty brought forth a lesser image of Nicholas Cage's character of Sailor Ripley in David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990), a much better film finally seeing a DVD release December '04...check it out.  Cochrane was entertaining as the psychotic Billy Mack, especially the scene when he's getting a rather large and obvious tattoo on his shaved head.  My favorite character was that of Dinosaur Bob, played by Jeffery Combs.  I'm a big fan of Combs, and I have to say, I didn't even recognize him here at first.  His presence on the screen nearly ellipses the others in just about any scene he appears, as he get his character full on, chewing the heck out of the scenery.  He's just a lot of fun to watch here, as he is in most of his film appearances.  Fonda and Wedgeworth appear as Starlene's hippy parents, and play their roles well, but I never got the impression they were really stretching their abilities too much, playing characters stereotypical to the actors.  Their characters lacked strength, but since they were supporting cast, I can't be too critical.  I thought the choice of music was really appropriate and with artists like The Flaming Lips, Meat Puppets, Mazzy Star, Reverend Horton Heat, and Johnny Cash.  One thing I feel I should mention is that there's a lot of violence and use of profanity in the film (but surprisingly little nekkidness, none by Zellweger, although she does don the short shorts, or Daisy Dukes, if you will, quite often...nothing like flirtatious, young white trash...), so if those kinds things turn you off, then you'd be wise to skip this movie.

The wide screen print on this DVD looks really good, although I thought the audio a bit soft at times, but there are English subtitles available.  There are a number of special features available, including deleted scenes, a production commentary track, a Reverend Horton Heat music video, and storyboard comparisons (you get to see the original storyboard and then the actual scene from the film side by side)

637368,4,6303383378,was this out first or was it natural born killers?who knows?they are both good though so whats it matter?2 lovers get into trouble over a robbery gone wrong and have to bail out.the only person i recognized was that dj chick from full house.she played a heroin [prostitute].thats quite a switch from miss goodie 2 shoes from the tv show.its a bit violent for kids.there is a lot of speed use in this one also and one guy takes lsd so its not for kids.there are a few really amusing robbery scenes in this movie.,1089331200,,511,4.389473684210526
637369,4,6303383378,"The opening scene of this movie is so brilliantly handled it just sucks you in and never lets go. Out to rob a convience store minded by a dim-witted teenager, our hero(?) just can't
help laying a little big-brotherly advice and philosophy on the
poor lad before getting around to actually emptying the till.
The dialogue between the two is handled so gracefully and with
such wit by all concerned that you just can't help wanting to find out what's next, even when it gets frightenly violent.
Renee Zelleweger is an absolute gem throughout, as an oversexed,
undereducated gun moll. This movie explores what happens when
people with Texas-sized dreams meet the limitations of their
squirrel-sized brains, and manages to do so with wit, style and
a light touch, even as it gets breath-takingly violent. And, yes, folks, Peter Fonda DOES steal the whole picture in his brief
turn as Starlene's burnt-out hippie dad. Don't miss this!",1066867200,,930,4.929936305732484
637370,5,6303383378,"This Movie is awsome! Its very violent, especially when billy gets stabbed in the neck with a fork!
This movie is both funny, violent, action and a romance. Its all the above! I would reccommend this movie to anyone who likes a little thrill. Action-packed totally!",1066521600,,265,4.782608695652174
637371,5,6303383378,"Okay, first off, you cannot go wrong with a movie that has the Butthole Surfers and the Jesus and Mary Chain on the soundtrack.
Now, this was another of those movies I rented because I got to Blockbuster late and all the ""good stuff"" was gone...this movie is so cheesy, it's hysterical!  It's one of those cool ""laugh out loud"" and ""don't have to think while watching it"" movies.
Key scenes to look for:  Billy Mac robbing the store, Billy Mac and the fork, Billy Mac and the tattoo, and Peter Fonda's cameo (or whatever his role is) in the movie.
I heard it was something of a rip-off of Natural Born Killers but since I never saw that, I don't know, but seeing as how Love and a .45 was made first...chicken or the egg, huh?",1015632000,,726,4.291970802919708
637372,4,6303383378,"Frenzied, stylish road movie in the off-beat lovers-on-the-run vein of Natural Born Killers or True Romance. Watty (Gil Bellows) and Starlene (Renee Zellweger) are our heros on the run after a botched robbery attempt when Watty and his vicious accomplice Billy (Rory Cochrane) leaves a counter girl dead, at the hands of Billy. On there trail are the demented criminals, Creepy Cody, Dinosaur Bob and Billy, who was left for dead. But our lovers are not killers, just simply misjudged. The over-the-top acting by an excellent cast and a surprisingly smart and lively script make for an exceptional film. Among road movies, this ranks as one of the very best. Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence, pervasive strong profanity, sexual situations, drug use and content, and a scene of nudity.",977097600,,793,5.061068702290076

Zellweger and Bellows make a great pair, Jeffrey Combs is wonderful as the psychotic Dinosaur Bob, and the movie works well as a disturbing comedy. You could say its Tarantino-esqe, but why bother with labels?",971740800,,330,4.610169491525424
637374,5,6303383378,"I watched this movie on a whim in 1995, and now I own it. Tarantino could never do something this good because he doesn't have a Midwest or Texas  vibe, which this movie has, and more (even Texas Rockabillymaniac Horton  Neat shows briefly). Zellweger uses her charm in a way no other actress can  -- her looks actually blend with her substantial talent. Bellows'  performance is perfect. NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED is the performance of Rory  Cochrane. He acts like he was born for the role.",967334400,,486,4.604651162790698
637415,5,6303383378,"You'll probably notice that this film copies Quentin Tarantino's style but still (or maybe, right because of this), it's an excellent choice. It's some sort of post-modern drama (which often tinges with comedy tough) set  in the southern part of the US. It's a mixture of Bonnie & Clyde, Fear  and loathing in Las Vegas (drugs pop up throughout) and Pulp Fiction, all  in one, shot by some kind of madman...",959558400,,407,4.704225352112676
