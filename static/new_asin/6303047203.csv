7835120,4,6303047203,"My lack of total enthusiasm for this edition of the Ted Turner series is probably based on my opinion of Henry Fonda as a movie star. Although honoured for the truthfulness of his acting, for me there is an element of dullness that makes him less of a presence. The proof here is in the clips from Mister Roberts with James Cagney, and even On Golden Pond with his daughter, Jane. In both cases, Fonda gets upstaged in terms of screen charisma. His appearances also reveal his lack of range, with only the bad guy in Sergio Leone's Once upon a time in the West as varying from his farmboy from the Midwest typecasting. His efforts at comedy here represented by The Lady Eve with his deadpan and slapstick, rely heavily on Barbara Stanwyck's abuse of him.
Hosted by Jane unusually filmed on location, this doco written by Joan Kramer and director David Heeley includes interviews with Peter and Shirlee Fonda, James Stewart and Sidney Lumet. It includes color home movies of black and white films, his regular return to the theatre to perform, 12 Angry Men as the only film he produced, 1974 TV footage of his stage Clarence Darrow, and examples of his watercolours that look more exciting than his acting. It also mentions the death of Frances Fonda, the mother of Jane and Peter, without stating that she was a suicide.
This stance is logical since such an act demands an explaination, and also because of Jane's emotionalism, particularly at the end, since this program was made not long after Fonda had died.",1004745600,,1511,4.684210526315789
