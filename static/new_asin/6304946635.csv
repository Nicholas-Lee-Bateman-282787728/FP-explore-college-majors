7880291,5,6304946635,"Featuring a great guest star turn from Michael Rennie (memorable as ""Klaatu"" in the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""), ""The Keeper"" is the best episode of the entire three-year-run of the show.  All the characters get great attention in this two-parter that features great camerawork, special effects, and use the music composed by John Williams for the pilot episode. After such a stellar episode, it is a shame that the ""powers-that-be"" decided to devote the second and third seasons on camp that would ultimately result in the show's demise.",999907200,,551,5.054945054945055
