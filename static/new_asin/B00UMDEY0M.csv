7052618,3,B00UMDEY0M,"I am very confused . Shark was a 3 part BBC documentary. There first disc of this 2 disc set contains parts one and two. The narration at the end of episode two talks about 'next episode'. Disc two contains special features and 'making of' spots. Where is part three? It's not in the menu for either disc, and 'play all' does not reveal it either. I feel cheated. What is on this set is good stuff, but it is incomplete.",1442361600,3,420,4.197530864197531

7052620,5,B00UMDEY0M,"This is the best shark documentary I have ever seen. I first watched pieces of it edited for Shark Week's Shark Planet special and was floored by the beautiful rendering of these magnificent creatures. There was clearly a lot of love and attention put into this series, and it shows in the dignified way the sharks are portrayed, the examination of their distinct capabilities, and some truly lovely shots of them in their natural habitat. I saw so many species of sharks--some I had never seen before! And it was so riveting to be surprised by sharks that have not gotten much focus on before--like the epaulette shark, which made my jaw drop when I saw what it could do. This documentary succeeded in its goal to present a new and expanded perspective of these creatures, and it renewed my respect and admiration for them.",1437004800,3,824,4.689655172413793
7052621,5,B00UMDEY0M,"This is the Shark documentary that I have been waiting for.  There are no unneccessary interviews, over the top commentary, or sections on shark attacks.  Essentially, BBC's Shark is what should be showing during Shark Week.  This is a documentary filled with beautifully shot footage that is narrated perfectly.  I am only halfway through this two part documentary, but I can already confidently say that it has been a worthwhile purchase.",1436918400,6,440,5.154929577464789
