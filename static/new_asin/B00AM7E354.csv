Additionally, some froze then eventually continued to play.  This is a lot of money to spend to get these kind of results.  I couldn't sit down and watch all of them within a month and therefore I have lost my chance to return them and get them back on time.  as you can imagine I am not satisfied and wouldn't even give it one star if this rating system didn't force me too.",1471478400,2,581,4.216216216216216
