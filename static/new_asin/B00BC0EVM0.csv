8565536,3,B00BC0EVM0,"I want to begin by stating that I have yet to view this product so I cannot comment on it's content other than to say that I am amazed by the RMAX organization in general and by Scott Sonnon in particular.  If Scott's not the best martial arts/yoga/general fitness instructor out there he's at least certainly in the top 10.  I have found if it's a RMAX product you simply can't go wrong.

That said, I write this to clarify the actors in this set of videos.  Listed at this time by Amazon as stars are Scott Summer and Summer Huntington.  Summer Huntington is the main performer in front of the camera and Master of Sport Scott Sonnon is the director.  This comes direct from the clubbell yoga site.  Whether Scott spends any time on camera or not I don't yet know.  Credit of any sort should be attributed to the correct people.

Thanks for posting this.",1381104000,,856,4.401273885350318
