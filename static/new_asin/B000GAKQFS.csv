8129956,3,B000GAKQFS,"There isn't much by way of redemption for this oddball piece of cinema.

A story about a crooked mafiosa hood played by (spaghetti western star) Peter Lee Lawrence who steals a shipment of arms,thus double-crossing his boss, Don Carmelo played by Adolfo Celi. The film is filled with unattractive,brutal misogynists.

Picture and sound quality are quite good considering no remastering has been done here. Picture ratio is 2:35:1 widescreen. No added extras on disc. Bargain price,buy only if you are curious.",1164067200,,509,5.271604938271605
