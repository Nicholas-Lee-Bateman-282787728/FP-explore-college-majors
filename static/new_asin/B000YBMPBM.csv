8231766,5,B000YBMPBM,"This is a great one, i bought it mostly for THE CRAFT but it ended up been a great buy!!!
I'm a big fan of The Craft and Neve Campbell's movies as well.
I'd never had the chance to see Wild Things before despite the hype when it first came out.
I would recommend both of these movies even if you can't get this double feature (which I highly recommend), you can always get them separately.
It was a big surprise for me especially with Wild Things because I found out that it was filmed in Miami, where i currently live :-)))",1220140800,3,524,4.147058823529412
