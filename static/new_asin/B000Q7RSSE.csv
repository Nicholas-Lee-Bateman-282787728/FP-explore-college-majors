8194858,5,B000Q7RSSE,"Product, ""The Little Rascals Christmas Special"" (Animated VHS 1979) was most popular female character, Darla Hood's last acting activity! She died on Wednesday, June 13th, 1979, of acute hepatitis & she was only 47 years & 5 months, approximately.
Additional fact: Darla Hood lived about a month to six weeks after this animation work was filmed & shot.
 PS: I surely wish that two Little Rascals' VHS' programs (""General Spanky"" & ""The Little Rascals Christmas Special"")
 WERE RE-NEWED AS DVD's & BLU-RAY!
