3920314,5,B002EWD0BS,"I have done 15 minutes of yoga every morning for the last 10 years or so.  The exercises I was doing started to feel like they were stretching my belly ligaments too much.  This video is a great balance between stretching the right places for a pregnant woman while still giving the women who wants more of a challenge the right level of challenge during pregnancy.

I recommend this video to anyone who is new or old to yoga for sure! :)",1272412800,18,438,4.317073170731708
3920315,5,B002EWD0BS,"I just received this DVD last week and have already used it twice.  I am 5-months pregnant with my third kid, work full-time, and am so busy at this time in my life that I am unable to attend in-person classes...which is a drag, but I am making the most of it.  I was soooo sick my first 3.5 months I couldn't do anything and am now getting my strength back and although this video was easy-to-follow because of the excellent verbal guidance (you can do it with your eyes closed if at all familiar with yoga positions) it was easy for me to focus on my balance and breathing instead of wondering if I was in the right position etc...  the workout was a challenge - but not too much.  there were a few things that were complicated transitions i.e. getting into Pigeon pose... but they give you enough time to make the transition (however you can do it comfortably) that I never felt rushed or behind.  Nothing about the video was annoying.  The set is visually pleasing.  I like that there are two parts to the video the first part is for prenatal and the second for postnatal.  I believe they are around 25 minutes each.

I also bought the crunch yoga mama video, but haven't tried it out yet.",1272240000,56,1193,4.337837837837838
3920316,5,B002EWD0BS,"I bought this early in my 2nd trimester and have used it ~2-3 times per week since then.  I am in my 3rd trimester and it's getting more challenging, but it still feels good at the end of the 30 minutes. I am hoping for an easier labor and delivery, so we'll see how that goes (this is my first baby, so of course I won't have anything to compare to). I also await the day when I can start the post pregnancy yoga.  It's quite a deal for 2 30-minute work-outs in one cheap DVD.",1270944000,5,477,3.9583333333333335
3920317,5,B002EWD0BS,I am so glad I am trying prenatal yoga!! This has made a huge difference so far in my pregnancy. It is so relaxing:),1268438400,,116,3.875
3920318,5,B002EWD0BS,I bought this dvd and have been using since my 30 months. I'm 8 months now and im doing yoga with this dvd almost everyday for 5 mins and I would say that I love it. The moves are slow and easy to follow. Also your breathing gets deeper as you keep practising. i have less back pain now and i feel my body is getting flexible for the labor. I'm also doing the meditation with another dvd which helps to reduce my stress level. i have 2 other yoga dvds but this one is my favorite as the poses are practical and tones each muscle in your body.,1266278400,29,542,3.981651376146789
3920319,5,B002EWD0BS,"This dvd was very sweet. It is a good workout and mind easer for the expectant mother. I was extremely ill for a good majority of my pregnancy...due to all day sickness vs. what they call morning sickness. This video helped give me a bit of energy and it was gentle enough for me to complete it without feeling more sick. It also has a postpartum yoga instruction at the end, but as you know, life gets busy after baby, and I just plain didn't use it. By the time I was feeling ready to pick yoga back up, I was ready to join my classes outside of the house again. Although I did watch the postpartum class and it looked very new mom friendly.",1265414400,,643,4.152
3920320,5,B002EWD0BS,"I'm in the 5th week of my 3rd pregnancy. I gained 45 with my first and was in terrible shape. I didn't loose the weight until after my 2nd pregnancy where I only gained 25, but started overweight. I finally lost all the baby weight and then some and now here I am for #3. I am no where near in great shape, but at least my weight is down and I'm working on it. I promised myself I would have a more healthy pregnancy this time. My diet is great, I just needed to find a workout that I would enjoy and that wouldn't take an hour of my time. I purchased 4 pregnancy workouts - 2 pilates and 2 yoga and I love them all. I looked at pretty much every prenatal workout Amazon has to offer (spent a couple days reading reviews) and am super happy with my choices. All 4 make the workout very personal, the music is great, and there isn't any of that super peppy over acting stuff like so many workouts. They are all well trained in their art and have many years of experience behind them.

#1 - Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
This is a great workout! This is my first time doing yoga, though I've done some of the moves in my regular non-pregnancy pilates workouts, and I'm loving it. It has really loosened up my stiffness and made my hips and lower back feel so much better. I thought I was going to die during my 2nd pregnancy because of all my aches and pains. I talked with many of my friends about yoga and what I should look for. They told me about how I should feel it, but not overstretch, to know what my bodies limits are. The breathing really helps. This one also has a postnatal workout I am looking forward to!

#2 - 10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia
This really energized me. It uses weights along with great moves and my heart rate was up and going. I love Lizbeth Garcia. I LOVE that you can pick which order you do the workouts in and you can do one or as many as you like! I'm looking forward to the postnatal workout after my beautiful little one arrives!

#3 - Pilates During Pregnancy with Niece Pecenka
All I can say is - wow! My legs are out of shape. The ab workout is great and helps me feel open and even helped my bloated feeling pass. The leg work is a challenge and has a lot of different moves my other pilates workouts don't, but I know it will get easier as I gain strength. Some of he movements aren't always the same length, but I still love doing this workout.

#4 - Yoga for Pregnancy Labor & Birth with Colette Crawford
I did this today and it really relaxed my body and mind (which I needed as my 3 and 5 year old were running around the house doing crazy things). It's very simple and straightforward and anyone can do it. I feel motivated after doing it and so many pressures are gone. As mentioned in some of the other reviews the girls in it aren't super skinny and that is kind of nice sometimes. She talks a lot about breathing, being in the moment, and just knowing your body. I would recommend this to anyone who just needs some time to learn to relax and do some great stretching to help with aches and pains!

I hope this helps anyone out there looking for some great workouts to stay in shape and feel in control during pregnancy. Just a side note, I've noticed working out really helps me control my cravings and wanting to over eat. It strengthens my mind and helps me feel in control.",1264809600,294,3366,4.188271604938271

3920325,5,B002EWD0BS,"The half hour prenatal yoga instruction has been really helpful during my pregnancy.  I am someone who used to exercise at least 5 days a week.  Six weeks into my pregnancy, between the nausea, demands at work, and getting sick for months on end, just walking for exercise and doing yoga has been a struggle.  This video has been convenient because I can do it at home when I feel up to it. I haven't tried the postnatal video yet, as I am still pregnant, but hopefully it will be just as helpful post-pregnancy.",1483833600,,512,4.425531914893617

3920331,4,B002EWD0BS,I like this yoga DVD. Some of the things she says are kind of annoying but I just tune her out. I have done some yoga off and on for the past couple of years but I'm far from experienced. I found the difficulty level to be good - I feel like I'm actually doing something without struggling to keep up or follow along. I'm 20 weeks right now and have been doing it for awhile and hopefully will be able to continue.

3920341,5,B002EWD0BS,I have the elements yoga for weight loss and it is my favorite workout so when I found out I was pregnant I kept doing that same yoga workout until I was about 20 weeks or so.  I found this workout and got it... Was hoping it was like the yoga for weight loss just with some modifications... And it is!  I am 30 weeks pregnant and do this workout every morning.  I started in with bad pelvic and sciatic pain about 8 weeks ago and This yoga workout along with visits to the chiropractor has kept my pain manageable.  This yoga is good for 2nd trimester as they do some planks and bridge work so I have a different one for 3rd trimester.  I will probably still do the stretching aspect of this workout as much as I can and put that with the workout that is for 3rd trimester and labor/delivery.  5 stars and I have definitely already gotten my money worth out of it :),1454889600,,867,4.130952380952381

She was the only one in the video and she wasn't sporting the giant belly I am.  I prefer when they have modifications for each trimester.  This is definitely my least favorite prenatal DVD.  I will probably never use this DVD again, that is how much I disliked the routine.  Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga and Short Forms with Jennifer Moore is my favorite and Hilaria Baldwin's DVD is pretty good too.  I wish I had skipped this one.",1437177600,,550,4.540816326530612

3920359,4,B002EWD0BS,"I have absolutely NO experience with yoga, but now that I'm pregnant I thought an exercise program that emphasizes stretching and getting ready for delivery would be a good thing to try.  I can follow what she says to do, and the camera angle is usually good enough that I can mimic how the model is moving. She occasionally gives suggestions for how to adjust the pose for later in your pregnancy, which I appreciate.  She doesn't do this for every pose however, so personally I wonder how well I'll be able to do a table top pose at 8 months.  I do find some of the ""feeling"" talk a little annoying.  Things like ""give an offering of silence"" or ""breathe in, especially filling the left lung"" make me roll my eyes, but that is just me.  The workout is enough to get me sweaty and my heart rate up, but not tire me out.

3920365,5,B002EWD0BS,"Keeping up a yoga practice has really helped maintain my physical, mental, and emotional health during pregnancy. I try to do it 5-6 times per week, once in a studio and the rest at home, so finding good DVDs has been really important.

My favorite is Hala Khouri's Radiant Pregnancy, but even the best program can start to feel stale if you do it 4 times a week for months on end, so I ordered 4 others to add to the mix and am reviewing them all here (in order of preference). Element Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga is also an excellent program that is only ranked second because it's shorter and more streamlined than Hala and doesn't offer as much variety (1 prenatal program instead of 3, no restorative poses or meditation), but sometimes simple and straightforward is exactly what you need.

1. Radiant Pregnancy with Hala Khouri - 5 stars
- Pros: Includes 3 completely distinct programs for each trimester; each program is divided into sections so you can do as much or as little you want each day; Hala provides clear instructions and honest and relaxing dialogue; excellent range of poses, stretches, and movements; one of the few programs that can get my heartbeat pumping while also offering more moderate alternatives if needed; includes Kegel exercises starting in the 2nd trimester.
- Cons: Some poses require props, but I used everyday objects from the around the house (throw pillows, picnic blankets, and a towel instead of a strap) and they worked fine until I decided to go ahead and buy the real deal. Only problematic when I travel.
- In sum: Wonderful program, highly recommended for all levels of experience and fitness, should be a cornerstone of any consistent prenatal practice.

2. Element Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower - 5 stars
- Pros: Clear and concise 30 minute prenatal routine, I can always find time for it; closely resembles a non-prenatal practice in tone and form, but with subtle variations; difficulty is enough to feel productive and strengthened but with well-timed pauses to regroup and recenter; narration is calm and soothing; no props needed; also includes a postnatal program (which I am looking forward to).
- Cons: Not much of a warmup before you begin, so may be better suited to people who are already familiar with yoga; not ideal for days when you have less energy and want something more restorative; only 1 routine so you probably need at least one more program if you plan to continue yoga throughout your pregnancy.
- In sum: Very good all around program for people who practice less frequently or need more than one routine in their practice.

3. Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga and Short Forms with Jennifer More - 4 stars
- Pros: The most challenging program I've found and a true vinyasa flow class, very invigorating and energizing; the full length routine is 1 hour and 15 minutes of constant movement (relaxation follows separately); despite challenging movements, subtle modifications make sure you stay stable and balanced throughout all three trimeters, with a model in each trimester demonstrating the correct variation; also includes a partner yoga routine and a separate DVD of ""short forms"" with 15, 30, and 45 minute routines for when you have less time.
- Cons: Would not make a good choice if you only select one dvd, program is too difficult for days when you have less energy, even the short forms (sometimes you just want stretching warm ups and/or restoratives, neither of which are offered in this program); mediocre production sometimes prevents you from getting a good view of the poses, which can be confusing if you're new to this program or to yoga generally; relaxation consists of 15 minutes of guided shavasana, no other meditation or restoratives, with narration I found more distracting than helpful.
- In sum: Great option for when you want a challenge and completely doable (don't let some of the reviews scare you off, you can always start with the short forms and work your way up to the full routine), would need to supplement with a more well-rounded option like Hala Khouri or Jane Austin for less active days.

4. Jane Austin Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars
- Pros: Upbeat and clear instruction; good emphasis on upper body strength in addition to legs and the pelvic floor; does have chapters (though they're not as clearly segmented as Hala Khouri); feel fully stretched and relaxed by the end.
- Cons: Only 1 routine; moderate difficulty wouldn't be hard enough for me to choose as my only program (still good as an alternate); pace is a somewhat relaxed and the full hour can feel a bit long; only soundtrack is ""om"" chanting which I can tune out most of the time but occasionally becomes distracting.
- In sum: Good program on the more gentle side but still engages the entire body.

5. Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea - 2 stars
- Pros: Honestly hard to think of many, but I suppose if you are really brand new to yoga and nervous about starting, then this incredibly easy program with demonstrations for all 3 trimesters could be a good option for you. You can also buy this as part of Shiva Rea's ""Yoga for Pregnancy"" set which includes a prenatal and postnatal routine, so perhaps you'd get more for your money that way.
- Cons: Really no challenge whatsoever if you've done even a little yoga or are in otherwise decent shape, it's really just 50 minutes of light stretching or holding very easy poses; on top of that, it's a poorly balanced routine, some parts of my body got no attention at all (lower back, calves, abdomen, arms) while others kept repeating the same movements over and over (hips, side waist, and quads); odd use of a chair in some poses when it really wasn't necessary, and they don't offer instruction for how to do the poses without the chair.
- In sum: Skip this unless you are really sure you want to start with the easiest possible program or got it as a gift (in which case who knows, maybe you'll like it).",1431302400,5,5928,4.722705314009662

I have only done yoga one time before, for a good few months about 7 years ago.  So I am familiar with, but no pro at it.  This video was challenging but not too much so.  It had me feeling more energized and relaxed at the same time.  I bought it along with:

3920368,5,B002EWD0BS,"I just received this DVD today, and I love it. I am somewhat familiar with yoga as I have participated in a few in-person classes as well as working out with The Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga DVD (another favorite, but not practical for pregnancy.) Regardless of being familiar with the various poses, I still definitely consider myself in the beginner category. The setting is calm and beautiful, the instruction isn't annoying, and while some poses were still slightly difficult for me, I know that the more flexible I get, the easier these poses will get. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to stay relaxed as well as fit throughout their pregnancy.",1428364800,,677,4.844827586206897
3920369,4,B002EWD0BS,"I love this video (prenatal only - haven't done the postnatal yet). It's short enough to fit into a busy day after my pre-schooler goes to bed, but enough of a workout and mindful yoga practice that I get enough out of it to make it worth doing. The practice is heavy on poses that build leg strength (warrior 1 and 2, reverse warrior, bound angle, etc.), which is good for building strength to carry around all of the extra weight that pregnancy brings. I don't feel tempted to push myself too hard for the stretches (which is important during pregnancy because of the risk of overstretching due to all of the relaxin circulating in the body), which is in large part because there's no emphasis on deep-stretching poses in this practice.

As far as ability level goes, I'd say this is a beginner video in that it only includes beginner-appropriate poses; however, be warned that there is pretty much zero instruction on proper/safe form on this video, so I would say that it's not really intended for someone who has never previously practiced yoga.

Overall, I feel good when I finish this practice - I feel like I've gotten a workout, and I feel refreshed. I like this video enough that I'd consider keeping it in my collection and using it occasionally even after I'm not pregnant anymore.",1427500800,2,1293,4.641921397379913

However, I found the 30 minutes prenatal workout a little too short and easy for me.  I practiced yoga regularly before pregnancy and this was way too simple.

3920373,4,B002EWD0BS,"There are two workouts on this dvd, a pre-natal and post-natal one.  I've done only the pre-natal one so far, nearly every day for the last 8 weeks (months 4 and 5) and I'm very happy with it.  It regularly helps my hip and leg cramping that plagues me in the night so I can have a pain-free day.  Recently my back has been hurting (mostly from moving) and this workout has helped with my lower back pain, too. The work-out is challenging, as yoga always is, but not tiring.  It is energizing and relaxing at the same time, if that makes sense.

I had some experience with yoga before but am no expert and I think this workout is perfect for the beginner or experienced novice, like me.  I like that it is a 30 minute workout so fits easily in your schedule (especially since you can conveniently do it from home) and stretches every part of you, especially the parts that tend to be tense like your lower abdomen and hips (for sciatica).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't incorporate kegel-type strengthening and because the narration is kind of silly sounding (""turn respectfully to you right shoulder""), but I quickly got used to the odd phrases and combine this workout with a strengthening one - Susan Bower's prenatal Barre workout that I also highly recommend.",1420329600,,1297,4.517094017094017

Not for the faint of heart!  Previous posts indicated that this is not for a novice at yoga, but I think that depends how far along in your pregnancy you are.  I am excited for the postnatal workouts.

Also, the narrator is a bit hippy.  Now, I didn't mind being told to ""fill my entire body with radiance"" but it really got on my husband's nerves.  I did mind when, into the third trimester, the video suggested I ""buoyantly lift my pelvis"" -- I mean really, does a third trimester woman lift anything buoyantly?",1416873600,,677,4.291338582677166

I consider myself moderately fit prior to pregnancy (normal to thin, worked out about an hour about 4 days a week) and know some yoga poses but am not a yoga expert by any means.

Pros:  Relaxing, Soft music
Cons:  I thought the instructions on this video were quite complicated, especially the isometric exercises.  I believe I'm doing it 80-90% correct and did not find it to be strenuous enough for my needs.  Many of the exercises are done standing, which unfortunately I can't do well right now due lack of balance.

3920396,3,B002EWD0BS,"I did enjoy the challenge of this DVD. I felt it was a bit rushed. I am only in my first trimester. I had been doing the Bar Method for about a month prior to this, so I am no stranger to exercise, and I've done yoga before, but this DVD was not what I expected. I am not very flexible, and I have always been uncomfortable in downward dog pose, even when not pregnant due to pressure on my wrists and in my head. I was very surprised that there was so much going on in the downward dog pose. The suggestion was that when you were farther along, you could put your hands on yoga blocks, or even the seat of a chair. I may try that and see if it helps. I believe the reason downward dog was so prevalent, is that it is supposed to reduce pressure on your pelvis during pregnancy. For the price, I am glad I got it so that I can challenge myself, but I would probably only recommend it to a very flexible person or a mid-range/experienced yogi, rather than someone new at yoga, or someone who hasn't exercised much or at all. If you are not looking to be challenged, and want very gentle prenatal yoga, this is not the DVD for you. The good news is that there were some poses in there that I doubted I could do, but when I tried them, I did quite well and they weren't as impossible or as uncomfortable as I thought they might be. I also like that some of the poses transition quickly enough to get your heart rate up, and it is a decent mix of fitness and relaxation yoga.

3920415,5,B002EWD0BS,"I highly recommend this prenatal dvd.

I am in the second trimester of my second pregnancy. I am in moderately good shape, and am working to stay in reasonable health during this second pregnancy. This dvd was a lifesaver during my first pregnancy, and I  am relying on it again this time around.

This workout is especially effective at easing my (otherwise constant) backaches. By the third trimester of my first pregnancy, I did this dvd every other night- just to get the back pain relief needed for a good night's sleep. It worked wonderfully. If I skipped a session, I'd pay with poor sleep from an achy back.

This dvd also provides a decent, moderate workout, especially for the second half of pregnancy when you've slowed down a bit. During the first trimester I found it very easy, but by the third trimester, this dvd was as much as i could expect to do in a day.

With this second pregnancy,  I still go to my regular yoga class a few times a week, and I've gone to prenatal yoga classes. This dvd is a good filler for when I can't get to those classes. I actually like this workout better than the in-person prenatal yoga classes, mostly because I know that after this workout I'll have a few hours of back pain relief- I don't always get that from my prenatal yoga class.

I've also tried a few other prenatal yoga dvd's. I found this one to be the best. Great instruction, relaxing music, beautiful scenery- you'll really want to be on the set. It's a nice relaxing break from the day. Other dvd's have poor instruction, poor film quality, or are so simple that they are not effective- at least not for me.

If there is one downside to this version, it is that this workout is definitely not strenuous for those looking for a complete workout. But, hey, we are pregnant, right?

I don't like this video as much as other prenatal yoga DVDs that I have been using, but I like it enough to keep it in the rotation. One thing that I find sort of distracting if you will, is that sometimes there is too much narration, and sometimes it is just a little too ""deep"" for me to fully incorporate into my mind! For example, the narrator says to isometrically do this or that to my feet, or energetically pull my feet towards each other, even though they are planted on the floor, or to breathe into my left lung, etc. I find myself wondering what exactly she means a lot of the time!

I really enjoy this practice and I find it stretches and relaxes me. However, if I had not been to several in person classes to understand the mechanics of some of the poses, I think I would find her instructions confusing. There is a lot of ""hugging your feet energetically together"" when they are on opposite sides of the mat, and some confusing talk about placement of your hips, etc. Since I already have knowledge of the pose and know the correct way to do it, I can ignore these vague instructions and just follow the flow.

The setting of the video is beautiful and the music is relaxing without being a distraction.

Overall, I think if you have a little prior yoga knowledge, you will enjoy this DVD.

I borrowed this DVD from a neighbor after complaining about a yoga DVD that seemed to gentle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Austin-Prenatal-Yoga-DVD/dp/B0039OS2Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Austin Prenatal Yoga DVD</a>&nbsp;- which I am holding onto because I think I may want it during my 3rd trimester). I am in my 2nd trimester and this yoga DVD is pretty good! I agree with some of the other reviews that I would like to hold some of the poses for longer, but I appreciate that this is about half an hour and that it gets my heart rate moving a little bit (not too much). On a day when I don't feel like doing a full workout, this is a great alternative to still get in some good stretching.

I'm going to try a few other yoga DVDs and will update once I can get more of a comparison. So far, this is a pretty good option and a good value for the price here on Amazon. My neighbor said she did the postnatal workout a lot with her last pregnancy and really liked it.",1360108800,,1055,4.759562841530054

3920435,3,B002EWD0BS,"The pacing isn't very good for the pre-natal routine.  I found myself wishing we held some poses longer, and feeling like I couldn't keep holding some poses as long as the video required. I agree with another review that couldn't figure out how to breathe into only the left or right lung, make my heart 'buoyant' or soften my skin.  It's tough stuff! I enjoy the post-natal routine much more than the prenatal - it's great for those of us that had c-sections and have weak middles - lots of nice stretches.",1359849600,,507,4.5
3920436,3,B002EWD0BS,"I have mixed feelings on this video.  I have about 12 years of experience doing yoga for fitness, and practice on what I consider to be an intermediate level.

This video has two different yoga sequences: one prenatal, and one postnatal; the prenatal sequence is intended for practice throughout all stages of pregnancy.  However, during my first and second trimesters, this video was WAY too easy; now that I am in my third trimester, it is quite uncomfortable to do many of the poses - for multiple reasons.  For one, several of the positions are just physically difficult to do properly with my burgeoning belly.  Second, there are several forward-fold-type poses, which are particularly uncomfortable if you are experiencing problems with acid reflux, as many pregnant women do.  Finally, the the instructor does not seem to take into account the shortness of breath many women experience when pregnant.  During my first and second trimesters, although more breathless than normal, I was able to follow along with the video with minimal issues.  Now that I am in my third trimester, I absolutely cannot breath as directed by the instructor.  In general, I needed to take at least twice as many breaths as directed.  Although this may not seem like a major issue for anyone just starting out with yoga, it is very important for your breaths and movements to coincide properly.

My other issue with this video is that, while a relatively simplistic yoga sequence, the instructor does not focus very much on form.  As I mentioned above, I have been doing yoga for awhile, but I still appreciate reminders for tucking my pelvis and maintaining proper form during poses - ESPECIALLY now that I am pregnant (I have to constantly remind myself to pull in my belly, even when I'm not exercising).  I have a feeling that those who are new to yoga will find that this video does a real disservice in that regard.  Furthermore, she gives instructions on changing hip & leg positions during some moves that are difficult to actually see - they're just something you learn how to do as you perfect positions.

Although I do have issues with this video, I plan to continue doing it - with some modifications.  In general, I enjoy yoga as a way to connect with my baby; this video puts an emphasis on forming an early bond with your little one, in a mostly non-cheesy way.",1358812800,4,2361,4.764127764127764
3920437,5,B002EWD0BS,Very happy with this dvd! I love that I can do it butt naked in my living room instead of in front of a bunch of people.  Very happy that it comes with a postnatal yoga also!,1357948800,,174,3.7027027027027026
3920438,5,B002EWD0BS,"I first purchased this DVD when I was entering my second trimester. I needed to find a workout that I could invest in for all the time I was spending at home. I've never done Yoga beforehand so I was a little guarded when it came to trying it. After the first time I was in love. I felt so relaxed afterwards! The post natal section is also great. You get to do more poses and get more of a workout. Being a new mom it was great that I got to find a way to workout at home and still feel so relaxed. i got back to my old figure about 6 months after I gave birth and its thanks to Yoga.

This DVD is single handily the reason I've become such a Yogi. Lol

Pros- Slow and easy to understand. Beginners get to familiarize themselves with the name of Yoga moves. The workout is about 30 mins, and a postnatal workout is included!

Cons- just the dumb sayings like ""breathe into you left lung"". Ummm, is that even possible?

I recommend this DVD to all pregnant moms who are interested in getting a good workout and find a way to relax at the same time.",1357689600,,1048,4.048309178743962

The prenatal portion is fairly simple but I still felt like I had moved around & got my blood pumping. Lots of good stretches & deep breathing, & the instructor is very descriptive & offers modifications if needed.
The only drawback is that the yoga session seems short to me. Maybe 20mins? I'm not entirely sure, but I was expecting something longer maybe 45-60mins. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing though. I still recommend it!",1355702400,,602,4.583333333333333

3920447,5,B002EWD0BS,"I have had this DVD for 10 months, and was waiting until I had done the prenatal and postnatal before writing a review. Here it is: I love this DVD!

- The production quality is excellent (narration is not done by demonstrator- very professional)
- The location is beautiful and music is calming. It's like a mental vacation!
- There is great emphasis on breath and on the details of each posture. I feel like it managed to improve my yoga, which via a DVD is a major compliment!

This DVD solved my sciatica and pelvic issues during pregnancy (I have sciatica and SPD). Kept me mobile and limber and balanced throughout. I am certain it made a difference in my labor as well (all 2 hours and 37 minutes of it!) Any time I felt tight or began to sleep poorly, I just did this DVD and felt better in the morning!

I would say- the DVD is not for an absolute beginner. Particuarly the postnatal. They are challenging. However, a newbie could catch up if they feel they are a natural at yoga. I've only done studio yoga a few times- and I found this challenging, but in a fun way. I found myself improving with each use. As long as you know your limits and are willing to take it easy as you learn, I think anyone could do this- it would just take patience.

At the end of each session, I feel grounded, peaceful, relaxed and strong.

Bottom line: Get this DVD, you won't be dissapointed! I had others, but this was the one I actually WANTED to do. And anything that you want to do at 9 months pregnant is a miracle!",1352332800,,1513,4.2578397212543555

However, I do recognize the benefits of yoga, especially during pregnancy. This DVD is perfect for me due to the short length; only 30 minutes. It's also pretty easy and relaxing, but I do feel refreshed and energized afterward. Several of the reviews I read mentioned that this DVD would be too hard in late pregnancy, but I have no idea why that would be the case. Like I said, I think it's pretty easy.

A few cons:
- If you're new to yoga, this could be confusing the first few times because she really doesn't explain the poses. However, I think it would be easy to catch on after a few viewings.
- I find ""yoga talk"" to be quite annoying. She says a lot of cheesy things, but I just ignore it.
- Some people may find the short length of the DVD to be a con, but that's actually what I love most about it.
- I don't really consider it to be a ""workout."" I get my workouts in by running, walking, hiking, and lifting. This is just a really good stretch to me, and a mild workout at best. But that's not why I purchased it.

All in all, I recommend this DVD. I wake up feeling stiff and sore in the mornings, and this has helped dramatically. I also feel energized afterward, and it's short enough that I'm able to squeeze it in several times a week. I'm glad I purchased this!",1347062400,2,1421,4.107913669064748

3920462,4,B002EWD0BS,"UPDATE: Had the baby via c-section. After 6 weeks I started the postnatal routine. It's perfect! My lower back was aching and my shoulders were hunched from slumping (bad, I know) while breastfeeding. One round with this postnatal routine and I felt so much better. So I'm adding one star. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm in my second trimester and have done some yoga, not tons, before now. I tried another DVD, Prenatal Yoga with Jane Austin, before this one, but I found the instructor just too corny (I don't ever want to hear about ""juicy hips"" again) and the routine unnecessarily slow and long. Elena Brouwer is much more matter-of-fact. She keeps the ""connect with your baby"" stuff to a minimum, though I'm warning you that she does several times order you to do so. Really, yoga people. I'm exercising. Can I catch up with my baby later? Her voice, which I found abrupt at first, is pleasantly straightforward, if a little stern, once you get to know it, and the setting is relaxing and attractive. The routine is not overly difficult, or at least not for me at this point in my pregnancy, with modified poses and stances, but she doesn't explain how to deal with loss of balance or dizziness, a typical pregnancy problem which I suffered several times during the standing poses. I also find her instructions confusing. ""Isometrically broaden your left seat?"" I've been thinking about this for a while and I still have no clue. Her breathing rhythm is very challenging for me, as well: during standing poses, which I never found difficult before pregnancy but do now, her inhale/exhale cycle is so long during some challenging movements that I found myself having to take extra gasps to compensate. Overall, I'm not inspired to do this routine often, but it's the only prenatal yoga DVD I've found so far that doesn't creep me out completely with touchy-feely sentimental exhortations.",1343001600,,1883,4.8328173374613

Prior to becoming pregnant I practiced hatha, vinyassa and Bikram yoga with four different teachers each week. Since becoming pregnant I've tried the following yoga DVDs and here is my opinion of each:

1. Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
Perfect for me right now, at 20 weeks. Excellent production quality shot in a beautiful, serene landscape. I love that Elena Brower uses voiceover to narrate rather than having the person doing the yoga narrate. She explicitly explains the positions in a lovely, calm voice.  I love the style of yoga, moving in and out of poses with breath as opposed to holding poses. I found the workout to be the perfect length, not too long.

2. Gaiam Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea
Professional production quality. My local library had a copy so I tried this very early in pregnancy. At that time it seemed too slow for me. For that reason it might be perfect for someone with no yoga background. I have a feeling it might be the right pace for me as I enter into the third trimester, when my belly is so big that I really need to slow down anyway. I will give it another shot in a few weeks.

3. Complete Prenatal Vinyassa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD set with Jennifer Wolfe
This was the right DVD for me early in pregnancy (0 to 18 weeks). I love that there are four workouts at varying lengths. This workout is challenging, moving in and out of poses at a good clip.  Recommended for those with previous yoga experience. Production quality is mediocre but that does not bother me. The studio where they shot the video must be in an urban location because at moments you can hear the sounds of traffic passing by. If I have learned one thing in yoga, it's that there's an art to ignoring environmental stimuli. Learning to focus inward is a good mental challenge. Jennifer Wolfe is sweet and easy to follow.",1332374400,,2096,4.505263157894737
3920474,4,B002EWD0BS,"There are few issues that I usually have with yoga DVDs.
Super corny-ness being my biggest pet peeve.  Although this one has a bit of that mawkish vibe (it wouldn't be yoga without it), I found it to be barely present.  If you're looking for a meditation guide, this isn't it.
I got a really good stretch and there were ways to make the exercises easier (which I needed).  I think if you start doing this DVD when you plan to get pregnant and in the early stages, then you'll be strong enough to do them once you start to grow.
I've done a few different yoga DVDs and so far, this one is my favorite.  I have not tried the post-natal exercises yet.  If it's terrible I will come back to review, otherwise, assume I liked it as much as the pre-natal portion.",1332374400,,757,4.229166666666667
3920475,5,B002EWD0BS,"I don't have any prior yoga experience but thought it would be a good idea to try something new. I started at the end of my fourth month and love this DVD. She is so calming and relaxing. She does the poses slow enough to where I am not struggling to keep up. Although I don't know ANY of the yoga poses, I don't feel this was difficult to keep up with at all. It is 30 mins long but it is so relaxing and I feel great afterwards! I have already recommended it to several of my other pregnant friends and am looking forward to the postnatal portion once baby girl comes in August! I would highly recommend this .. even if you have NO prior yoga experience like me :)",1332115200,,666,4.053030303030303
3920476,5,B002EWD0BS,"I recently purchased this DVD for my pregnant granddaughter.  I am a Yoga teacher and live 2 hours away from her which keeps me from helping her with yoga.  She has not done much yoga and due to work and limited time, taking classes in her area was not an option.  I knew that Elena Brower is a wonderful teacher and teaches the way I myself do. So, I bought this for my granddaughter knowing I could be confident that she would get the teaching she needed even though there may be some things she couldn't do.  Thanks to Elena and Elements, my granddaughter can at least practice yoga safely.  And thanks for sending it in a reasonable amount of time.

Namaste,

Nancy",1332115200,,669,4.390243902439025
3920477,2,B002EWD0BS,I never leave reviews but i felt compelled after 16 minutes of doing this prenatal yoga exercise. It was very strenuous on my pregnant body (in 3rd trimester) and the poses feel rushed. I am a newbie with yoga but I have done other workouts that leave me feeling GREAT at the end. this workout exhausted me (I'm huffing and puffing as i write this)! i had to stop half way through because there was no way my body could handle these poses. There also isn't a warm up. She jumps right into the yoga. the poses are good but not for a pregnant woman!!,1331337600,,548,4.228571428571429
3920478,5,B002EWD0BS,"I started doing prenatal yoga at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and probably read every review on every prenatal yoga DVD out there! I'm glad I picked this one. I do have yoga experience, but nothing intensive. The intro is a bit long, but I use that time to get my mat set up. The best thing about the DVD is it's short! There is no excuse of not having enough time to do it :) The poses are explained well and are not too difficult yet you still feel stretched, strong and relaxed after. Be aware, this is not a strenuous cardio yoga session. I combine it with a vigorous walk every day to get my cardio in. All in all, a good buy.",1330905600,2,636,4.055555555555555
3920479,3,B002EWD0BS,"I like the actual yoga part - it leaves me feeling stretched and relaxed, which is what I'm looking for. I'm currently at 11 weeks, started this around 8 weeks and hope to continue through the end.

I DON'T like some of the talking. ""Fill your right lung."" I don't know how to fill one lung and not the other, and I don't think anyone does. ""Lift your body luminously."" What does that even mean? And lots of talk about connecting to and honoring my baby... including bowing to my baby. I'm sorry, I love this kid, but bowing?

So ... great as far as exercise, but I wish she'd just stick to telling me how to do the poses.",1330300800,7,622,4.175
3920480,5,B002EWD0BS,"I loved the video!!!!!  Since I was a huge fan of yoga before I was pregnant, it is not surprising how much I love this video.  After I finished the 30 minute workout, I felt refreshed and ready to start my day.  It is a morning routine that every expectant mother should try!  I was so happy when my doctor told me I could do prenatal yoga that as soon as I got home, I went searching for one!  Thank you Element:  Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga for changing my life!!!!",1330041600,,466,4.122222222222222
3920481,2,B002EWD0BS,"I ordered this for my 2nd pregnancy. In first trimester I tried to follow the poses and found them quite difficult to do. I could still do it, but didn't feel comfortable about continuing practicing this. It is only for 30 mins. I haven't seen the postnatal part yet. So don't know about it. May be it will help me then.

Earlier I did follow another prenatal yoga demonstrated by Shiva Rae and it was quite useful. Poses were given with 3 different options for each trimester. I person can choose a difficulty level that she is comfortable with. Every person is different and every time our body condition changes esp. during pregnancy. I found what I did earlier was way better than this yoga cd.

3920482,4,B002EWD0BS,"I really enjoyed this yoga dvd, it goes a little quick for the first time but once i learned the routine and poses i was able to enjoy it more because it flows pretty well.  i am looking forward to the postnatal part after i deliver :)",1328140800,,235,4.0
3920483,5,B002EWD0BS,"This is a great video for those who are new to yoga like me. It's not overwhelming and leaves you really refreshed afterward. After 2 weeks of using it, I notice I am getting more flexible and stronger. I also had sciatic (sp?) nerve pain on both sides before I started this video and now it's totally gone. I attribute it to this video. It has really helped me out a ton! I highly recommend it!",1327881600,,395,4.2105263157894735
3920484,5,B002EWD0BS,"I am 7 weeks postpartum and just picked this DVD up looking for a good after-baby yoga routine to supplement my workout as I try to get back into shape. I haven't done the prenatal workout and so can't speak to that, but after completing the postnatal routine for the first time, I feel amazing. I don't remember when I've felt so great following a yoga routine. This practice made me sweat a little, but I was able to do all but one of the positions. The instructions are easy to follow and I absolutely love the flow. It was also refreshing that the DVD didn't mention your baby and post-baby body a million times, just referred to it occasionally - for example, a modification for nursing mothers. I'm looking forward to doing this practice every night after I put the baby down, what a great way to end the day!

If you've not done yoga before I'd probably start with an intro DVD will break down each position in greater detail, but if you've had a beginners class or two, you should be able to jump right into the practice without much trouble.",1327017600,,1050,4.412371134020619
3920485,5,B002EWD0BS,I hardly worked out before I got pregnant. Decided to try this DVD to help improve stregnth. It's easy to follow and it strengthens your body without over working yourself. I strongly recommend.,1326931200,2,194,4.909090909090909
3920486,5,B002EWD0BS,"I like this DVD because it's only 30 mins and it really works your muscle groups. However, it's nice because I don't feel like I need to change into sports bra and full-out workout clothes because you don't end up drenched in sweat or anything. It is definitely not too difficult (I had never done yoga before ever) but you still feel like you did your exercise for the day!",1326931200,,374,4.357142857142857
3920487,5,B002EWD0BS,"I received this as a gift and I've done the prenatal workout a few times. I love it. I was having problems with my hips and my mom ordered me this as a surprise to help. My legs, hips, and my lower back feel great after doing the workout. After the first time my knees ached a bit and I was worried it was going to be hard in them, but now they feel great. I've never done yoga before but I have done pilates before my pregnancy so I felt confident I could do the poses. She does move quickly during the middle if the video but I think that lends to the workout- I breathe a bit heavier so I know it's working. I move a little slower during those times because I want to be sure I am doing the poses correctly. It's 30 mins long and perfect for right before my morning shower. I can't wait to try the postnatal segment. For beginners like me I would recommend going at a slower pace at first to be sure you're in the correct poses.",1326240000,,931,3.983957219251337
3920488,5,B002EWD0BS,"I ordered this along with the Gaiam videos (Summer Sanders and Shiva Rae) and I really, really like this DVD. It's a reasonably good workout (I was doing a lot of yoga at an advanced beginner level, but then stopped a few months before I got pregnant so am in sadly mediocre shape at 20 weeks), and the production values are really nice. I love the outdoor setting. I can actually make myself do this workout on the days I don't think I can deal with anything else. I just wish there was another prenatal session (preferably a longer one).",1326067200,2,539,4.4
3920489,4,B002EWD0BS,"I have been doing the prenatal yoga portion of this DVD through my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I believe I'll be able to use it all the way to the end, as I find it has a good balance of relaxation and challenge and nothing inappropriate for late pregnancy. I really enjoy the standing series of poses. And I'm always happy when there's pigeon pose. The voice over doesn't bother me, as other yoga DVDs have this as well. The one thing I find backward in the DVD is the breathing for cat/cow or similar transitions (usually you'd exhale while rounding your back) - but it doesn't ruin the yoga at all.. Overall I'd recommend this DVD for the Prenatal section. I'm looking forward to doing the Postnatal section as well.

Other prenatal DVD's I'd recommend: Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga - definitely more challenging and I had to give it up beyond 35 weeks due to heartburn (lots of downward dog); Desi Bartlett's Prenatal Yoga - very relaxing, but also has a good standing series of poses.",1326067200,2,995,4.589887640449438
3920490,5,B002EWD0BS,"Prior to being pregnant, I did P90X yoga, which obviously is not appropriate for baby.  I got this DVD after reading other customer reviews, and I absolutely LOVE this routine.  It has helped keep me limber, helps with breathing, and I love the fact it's just the right length workout.  I have been really happy with this routine, and I'm looking forward to the post-natal routine after my son is born in March.  I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a good workout during pregnancy whether you've done yoga every day or you're just beginning.  Resting Child pose has helped me through all the nasty stretching phases as well as helped to ease the discomfort of Braxton Hicks.  Definitely worth every penny!",1325980800,,715,4.819672131147541
3920491,5,B002EWD0BS,I love the prenatal Yoga workout.  I've done very little yoga in my past but wanted to try it with this pregnancy.  I love the flow and the background is beautiful.  This is great for beginngers.,1324166400,,195,4.361111111111111
3920492,4,B002EWD0BS,I loved this yoga routine and the way the instructions were delivered. The routine is fairly basic and just right for  a pregnant women. The prenatal section is under 30 minutes which means that one can rarely be too busy to accommodate this yoga in a daily routine.,1324080000,,266,4.541666666666667

3920494,3,B002EWD0BS,"I bought this based on the reviews. I thought this would be a good DVD for someone who hasn't done a lot of Yoga, but knows some basics, I was wrong. There is no warm up at all, you go straight into the yoga. I found that the first few positions were kind of hard to start with, the positions would be better later in the video when you have a chance to warm up to them. I am not on a regular exercise routine and was hoping to get on one with this video, but found that I was overwhelmed within the first few minutes of this video and was unable to continue. I think this DVD is best for someone who already does yoga/ exercise on a regular basis.
I got no pregnancy relief from this DVD. I gave it three stars because I can see the potential in this video for someone who is a little more advanced than I with Yoga.",1320192000,,817,3.9575757575757575

Only negative i would say is that it moves really quickly so sometimes i feel a bit rushed.",1312934400,,357,4.114285714285714
3920497,3,B002EWD0BS,"I'm in my second trimester and haven't as yet tried the postnatal yoga sequences on this DVD, but here are my impressions of the prenatal yoga.

Pro:
1. Quick session (about half an hour)
2. Instructor is pleasant, not long-winded
3. Has a few poses (like pigeon) which are extremely beneficial to pregnant women.
4. The scenery behind the woman practicing looks lovely! I wish I could sit there with a cup of hot tea! (Irrelevant, but still)

Con:
1. Feels a little hurried - don't have enough time to hold all poses for as long as I would like.
2. Does not end with shavasana (lying down on the floor) - which I really enjoy at the end of a yoga sequence.
3. I felt more short of breath than relaxed through some sequences and I am no yoga newbie.

If I had tried this video out before I bought it, chances are I would have skipped buying it altogether.
It's a good video, but not something I personally find appealing to me.
I love Desi Bartlett's Prenatal Yoga and Yoga Mama by Crunch.
However, the money is spent and I am going to hold on to it for a day when I feel terribly energetic and for the post-natal workout.",1312502400,69,1122,4.283018867924528

3920499,5,B002EWD0BS,"I have done yoga on and off for 2 years, using DVDs and going to a studio. I feel like I have moderate knowledge of the practice and experience with many poses. I was looking for a moderate yoga DVD (not too difficult, not too easy) to start in my second trimester.

I really enjoyed this DVD and it seems perfect for a moderately experienced user.  It was well paced (you have time to get into a pose and then it flows into the next pose), a perfect 30 minutes in length, and it is similar to the yoga practice that I am used to. Elena looked to be toward the end of her second trimester (maybe beginning third!) and the modifications for yoga poses felt perfect for my body. There was a voiceover for guidance, but it wasn't annoying like previous ones I have encountered. I appreciated that there were enough poses to build strength and they flowed well together. The practice ended with enough stretching for the time allowed. I would have liked to see a model for each trimester, but I managed without it.",1311897600,,1010,4.39572192513369

For the first time yoga player, it might be little challenging but if you and your baby are healthy I would really recommend this DVD.After 30min yoga you will feel absolutely great, calm, happy and accomplished!!",1311033600,,513,4.354166666666667

I was expecting more abdominal work since that's where most moms have problems.  It's a 30 minute routine very similar to other regular yoga routines, nothing special & nothing that really targets postnatal women.  On the bright side, it's a good workout when you don't have much time.  I feel very relaxed once it's over.  I rotate this with my other yoga dvds to change it up.",1310428800,,482,4.6117647058823525

I'm not highly experienced in yoga- just a few at home videos and a few classes at the gym- but I understand the basics and am usually able to follow without much difficulty.  Well about 20 minutes into this video I wanted to throw it out the window!  I don't like that the narrator was not actually the person performing the actions.  That struck me as odd.  Yoga isn't always easy to copy- its not like step aerobics where you can just mimic the moves.  In a yoga video, the descriptions are important so you know where to put your weight, where you should feel a stretch, placement of your feet, which muscles to flex, etc.  You can't ""see"" most of these things in the video and the narration HAS to be able to relay these things.  This video DOES NOT do this at all. It says phrases like ""coaxing your feet"" and ""hugging your feet together""... what the heck does that mean?  Maybe I'm just not advanced enough in yoga to understand these phrases but if that is the case, then the video should specify that its for an advanced yoga student.  Sorry, but after I (tried)to follow this video I ran right to my computer to write some reviews so no other poor mommy's-to-be waste their money!!",1307923200,8,1252,4.404347826086957

Now that I'm in the second trimester and getting my energy back, I'm feeling more like myself and ready to be active again.  I  started with purchasing the following DVDs: (this one)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Prenatal-Postnatal-Yoga/dp/B002EWD0BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Prenatal-Pilates/dp/B000RIWARG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autumn-Calabrese-Mighty-Mommies-9-Months-of-Fitness-Prenatal-Workout/dp/B0032ET55W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autumn Calabrese: Mighty Mommies 9 Months of Fitness- Prenatal Workout</a>.  Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga is the first one that I tried.  I will also review the others when I get the chance.

Overall, I liked the practice.  For reference, my favorite non-prenatal yoga dvds are by Shiva Rea and Eion Finn.  Knowing them, I'm using to having several different routines on each disc, so it's a little disappointing to just have one prenatal workout on a disc.  As I went through the workout, I kept thinking how easy it was compared to what I might normally do.  But guess what - it kind of tired me out!  I think I overestimated my energy level.  I had been feeling really stressed out and inflexible, and this truly made me feel a lot better.  The next day I felt a very light soreness in my shoulders which was just due to the stretching as no part is very difficult.  So, it's no big workout, but it is great to help you limber up and release tension.  I was a little disappointed that there was no shavasana; it just kind of ends.  I solved that problem by doing my own shavasana.  :)

I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of your experience with yoga and even if you don't feel like you have a lot of energy yet.  For me, it is/was a good dvd to help me get back in the swing of things. But as I continue to feel even better (hopefully!), I will probably look for something slightly more challenging.",1306281600,2,2429,5.76685393258427
3920507,4,B002EWD0BS,"I just entered my second trimester of pregnancy.  Before I got pregnant, I regularly attended yoga class...then I was slammed with morning sickness and fatigue, and also could not find a straight answer on what was safe and what wasn't as far as yoga, so I decided to get this video.

I had been off the mat for a while when I started the video, and I was so grateful for all of the modified poses.  I don't think I could do some of the regular pre-pregnancy moves (like a fast-paced sun salutation) anyway because of dizziness.  This video eases you into downward dog, forward bends, triangle, and many more.

The setting is beautiful, and the music isn't too cheesy.  In short, it's something I can do over and over without getting annoyed.

My only complaint is that I didn't really feel like I was getting a good workout as I would in my regular yoga class.  The DVD is divided into prenatal and postnatal workouts, about 30 minutes each.  I plan to use this as a supplement to walking or other activity (the same day), and don't expect to stay fit from doing just this.  I think it will help tone, but it's not aerobic like a regular ashtanga yoga class would be...but maybe that's the point.

I was just grateful to get back on the mat without worrying about doing harm to my baby.  I feel like the DVD has given me some good fundamentals and modifications that I can take with me to yoga class.",1304380800,,1401,4.387596899224806

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is pregnant or has just had a baby. The workout is both calming and challenging. With each pose I felt relaxed but at the same time could really feel it working. The aim is to create space in your body particularly around your abdomen, to relax and to build strength- all important for your changing body. I feel energised yet relaxed at the same time as I only just finished my workout and can't wait to do another session tomorrow.",1303084800,,591,4.381818181818182

3920515,4,B002EWD0BS,"I've just done the prenatal workout for the first time, and really enjoyed it. The instructor moves fairly quickly through moves, and there is not too much explanation of positions, which I really like, as I have done quite a lot of yoga in the past. I would not recommend this DVD to people for beginners for this reason. Yoga positions need to be held in the correct position, and there are a lot of subtle adjustments that you can only get from having an instructor actually with you, or from a detailed explanation, otherwise, you can think you are doing it correctly, but actually are not.
The setting is nice and calming, as is the instructor, and the voice-over is very pleasant and not at all distracting, while the positions and sequence are explained clearly, so I felt able to really focus on my breath, without having to constantly be watching.
Good so far.... I just hope I don't get bored of it. The 30min workout is nice, but maybe a little too short for my liking.",1300665600,,980,4.51123595505618
3920516,3,B002EWD0BS,"Note: This review is based on the prenatal portion of this DVD only.  First of all, let me say that I really like the moves on this video, however to me it seemed 1- pretty short - I think I'd have to do this 3 times a day in order to get anything out of it; and 2- A little rushed.  Especially while pregnant, I like to hold my positions for a few seconds in order to really get a good stretch.  I found with this that as soon as I figured out which position we were doing, we were switching to a new one.  Consequently, I didn't feel the stretches too much. Also, not to be picky, but the lighting is really kind of stark in the video (think florescent mall lighting), which wasn't too relaxing. I got another video as well that I'll be trying tomorrow - hopefully it's better!",1299628800,,779,4.105263157894737

3920518,5,B002EWD0BS,"I got this tape during my second trimester, because I knew it would be good to do yoga during pregnancy and I was having trouble motivating myself to exercise. The prenatal sequence feels SO good- good for my muscles, my limbs, joints, and a great stress reliever! But I was only doing it 2-3 times a week initially. One week, I didn't do the tape at all, and then I developed such terrible sciatica that I could barely walk for a couple of days and was in tears with pain. I was so worried that, if that kept up, I would have to use most of my maternity leave before I even had my baby! Let alone, how could I have a natural delivery if I could barely move! So I decided to see what would happen if I did the prenatal sequence every day, at least once but sometimes twice.

That combined with ensuring that I only sleep on my side, and that I remember to get up and walk around at work, has cured my sciatic pain! And very quickly. On top of that, my whole body feels better, I have more energy, less stress, and I am more toned and feel more prepared for labor.

I am due in May, so have not yet done the post-natal sequence. But I definitely will when I am able to 6-8 weeks after delivery!

If you are pregnant, I strongly recommend getting this tape and doing the prenatal sequence EVERY day! Rather than being like an exercise chore,  I look forward to it as it is relaxing and just feels so, so good. And will help you to look good during your pregnancy, too.",1298505600,,1466,4.151408450704225
3920519,5,B002EWD0BS,"I am 33 weeks pregnant, and found this to be challenging while not over doing it, and rejuvenating. A lot of the pressure in my hips and lower back was relieved. The video is very simple and easy to follow, not annoying or cheesy. It is set at a good pace and the setting and music are peaceful. Elena's voice is soothing and she is very knowledgeable. I really love this routine, and feel that it would be beneficial for nearly every pregnant woman, assuming she is doing the poses correctly.

That being said, if you unfamiliar with yoga and have never tried it before I wouldn't recommend any yoga dvd, and that you instead seek out an actual instructor or class as it is very important to know the subtle details of the poses, as well as your own physical limitations, especially when you are pregnant. If you are looking for some kind of hardcore ""work out"" this is not for you either. This is a way to strengthen and open the muscles in your body. Yoga was (and still is) intended as a method of prayer and meditation, so keep that in mind when starting out for the first time. Much like water aerobics, whether you are in shape and feeling unchallenged or out of shape and easily become sore, a routine like this one is great because the muscles are being worked whether you 'feel it' or not. There will be long term benefits regardless of your skill level or your ability to fully complete the work out.",1297641600,,1411,4.406130268199234

I have tried other prenatal yoga DVDs and found them to be too bouncy and or the instructors were to chatty.  The setting of the flower trimmed back yard overlooking the ocean was a nice view but not distracting.

The prenatal portion of the dvd runs @40 min.  I really, really like the instructor, Elena Brower - she knows what positions an expecting mother should enter into and has a wonderful sense of calm to her voice.

I would not recommend this dvd to beginners, especially if they just ventured into yoga at the start of their pregnancy.  Instead, for beginners, I would recommend  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2: Yoga.

In addition, if you are an advanced yogi, you will find this dvd is not the most challenging.  Instead, I would recommend something more like  Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga ~ Jennifer Wolfe for more advanced yogis.  However, this dvd is great to have for those days where you feel like your body has less energy as it does calm the body and allow for some really good flexibility poses.",1295222400,13,935,4.716049382716049

The poses are very doable at all months of pregnancy. I attribute this DVD to my short labor and 3-push delivery! My husband did the DVD with me and had a good workout. The post-natal yoga really targets calves and abs. I still do these DVDs even though I'm not having another child! You can't go wrong with this DVD.,1293667200,,492,4.53932584269663

3920529,2,B002EWD0BS,"I didn't use this DVD for the prenatal portion of my pregnancy.  Instead I used Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea, which I would recommend.  The practices are modified for each trimester and there is a person demonstrating all of the moves in each trimester.  For someone like me who hadn't religiously practiced yoga, I was able to choose the modifications that worked best for me.

Now that I have had my baby, I tried using the Postnatal and Prenatal DVD by Elena Brower.  I found this DVD to be too difficult.  I found myself having to modify moves often.  This could be for two reasons:  One, I am not someone who has done a lot of YOGA in her life, and second, I had a c-section.  Even though it has been 7 weeks since my baby was born, many of the moves are two difficult for my stomach muscles to handle.  In addition, I found the DVD boring, and again that could be b/c I don't typically do YOGA.  I couldn't wait for the DVD to be done.  I found her way of speaking to be annoying (buoyant heart) and I don't need to hear the correct terminology for the movements.  (she would say the movement, for example triangle pose, and would then follow it with the way that movement is said in the traditional language)

I would say that the postnatal portion of this DVD should be done by someone who practiced more advanced YOGA throughout the entire pregnancy and could handle these movements.  I would also say that if you have had a c-section, the postnatal portion will most likely be too difficult for your abdomen to handle.",1290988800,4,1526,4.4

I wanted it for the stretches that it has, as my back always bothers me during pregnancy. It fits the bill perfectly!

I skimmed over the postnatal side of the DVD, but have not used it yet. It seems to be along the same vein, although a little more strength orientated.

I wasn't always thrilled with the narration,but it was good enough. Sometimes I had to turn to the screen to understand what we were doing instead of being able to follow just her words.

If you are a beginner I cannot imagine that this would be a hard DVD. I am at the end of my 1st trimester. Whenever a pose becomes difficult, RELAX into it and DO NOT push yourself [you'll get hurt...and be sorry] If it HURTS, stop bending so hard & relax yourself for a second...the more you do it, the more flexible you become and the easier it is, so don't get discouraged.

It's not annoying and the scenery and instructions are thorough. Being somewhat of a novice, I found the stretches to be different than expected. I thought there would be more back stretches and some of the poses I am used to, but there were only a couple. Some of the instructions I had to listen to a couple of times (i.e. 'isometrically gather your feet together)...I wasn't used to this type of verbage, but you get it after a minute. Overall, I find this DVD adequate and hope it will help limber me up for the big day!

UPDATE: 5-26-11

I updated this review from 4 to 5 stars. This DVD has become one of my favorites after using it for some time. I now have a 6-month old baby and have been using the Post-natal portion and definitely feel my flexibility returning. I have gotten used to the verbage in this video and totally understand what Elena is trying to convey. Her voice and demeanor is very relaxing. The music is very soothing as is the scenery. I really like the routines. In the Pre-natal segment, you are guided into poses such as warrior, triangle, pigeon, table, standing forward bends, and seated spinal twists. She takes the time to get you breathing with your baby and setting intentions for your family.

In the post-natal segment, you do full boat, downward facing dog, and sun salutation to name a few. I really like this routine especially. I was tired one afternoon and instead of taking a nap (which is almost impossible with two children:) I did yoga with her and afterward felt completely rejuvenated and refreshed. I was grounded and felt like I gave something TO myself and was better able to give OF myself when my children awoke from their naps.

She has a very calm and soothing voice with no meanlingless chatter. The music is soft and suitable. She also does a good job explaining what's next. I find that the less experienced instructors often go into a move without giving much of a warning. They also don't explain how you should be aligned or when you should breath in versus out. Elena does all of this.

As far as the workout, I don't think it's very hard. I don't sweat or get out of breath, but I can see why some may find the poses a challenge if they aren't used to yoga or are very out of shape. This would be an issue with any DVD since each of us are at our own fitness levels and have personal preferences.

I use this video when I feel tired, have aches or feel ""tight"". Afterwards, I always feel more relaxed and stretched. The workout is pretty quick and is well worth the price.

The routine doesn't change from one trimester to the next, but the instructor mentions adaptations you can do, although I haven't had to change anything yet.  The poses are a good compromise between strengthening and stretching when you have a belly in the way, and it feels really light and flowing.

The instructions are detailed and the background scenery and music are nice; you don't mind them even after doing the workout several times.  The poses are easy to learn even if you've never done yoga before.  This is not a workout that will whip you into shape, but it is very calming/relaxing and great for focusing on deep, slow breathing.

If you are looking for a real break-into-a-sweat dvd, this is not what you're looking for. If you are looking for something to help you de-stress and help you connect with your body and your child, then this is perfect.

8368417,3,B002EWD0BS,I really liked the other Element Yoga DVD's so I got this for during pregnancy. I found this one to be a little boring. The trainer uses more words than necessary to describe the different poses. I never finished the prenatal sequence.,1520467200,,235,4.619047619047619
8368418,4,B002EWD0BS,"This is a great 45min workout for home. However, I did not always understand the words she used to tell you what to do in each pose, as I am not experienced in yoga. But the poses, themselves, were very manageable for a beginner like myself.",1517961600,,241,4.260869565217392
8368419,5,B002EWD0BS,"I bought this DVD during my 3rd trimester and never used it. I ended up going to a studio and taking prenatal yoga classes instead. After, our daughter was born, being home and wanting to get back in shape, I decided to finally try the post natal yoga workout. I have been doing it every day since! I love it and now, I regret not using it during my pregnancy! I find a lot of the poses are similar to the ones in the classes that I took. I love Yoga, but it gets expensive to go to studios. This DVD is great for a beginner and it's only 30 minutes a day which I can do while my daughter is napping. I usually don't write reviews; however, I do read them and for someone who searched for the perfect Yoga DVD, this was it! And, for the price, you really can't go wrong! Hope this helps anyone who is trying to decide if they should purchase this! Yes!!!",1517702400,2,854,4.059171597633136
8368420,3,B002EWD0BS,"After doing several other yoga programs, I found this one to be a bit...corny. I just wanted to be able to do yoga with my growing baby bump, but it turned out I couldn't keep from laughing at the cheesy ""become one with your baby"" lines.
Other people might really enjoy this, but it wasn't for me.",1510704000,,298,4.245614035087719
8368421,3,B002EWD0BS,A little too advanced for me- beginner here.,1505433600,,44,4.625
8368422,5,B002EWD0BS,"I love this DVD, it suits my needs perfectly. The yoga sequence is neither too fast nor too slow, and the instructor does a great job in explaining each of the positions. The instructor's voice is very soft so as the background music, and it makes me feel very relaxed.

The exercise does require some prior experience with yoga though. There is also only one prenatal yoga sequence. I wish it offered more options, doing the same sequence over and over again may get somewhat tedious. Besides that, this is a great yoga exercise, and it does help relieve my backache, joint pain, and leg cramps (all that usually comes in one package with pregnancy).",1498694400,,651,4.660869565217391
8368423,5,B002EWD0BS,I really like it! Only thing one move the pigeon was a little hard for me with the growing belly in my way. But I'm sure that depends on the person. I think it's a great pregnancy yoga workout! Can even see myself doing this after but I haven't gotten to the postnatal yet. Pretty sure this can be used long after pregnancy!,1498262400,,324,4.158730158730159
8368424,1,B002EWD0BS,"Too slow of a pace, it annoyed me along with the constant ""take a deep slow breath"". Instructor failed to realize that not all pregnant women can take deep breaths.",1494806400,,164,4.5
8368425,5,B002EWD0BS,"This has been my favorite prenatal yoga DVD so far. Really great poses, rythym, easy to follow and great for pregnancy.",1492300800,,119,4.714285714285714
8368426,4,B002EWD0BS,I have 2 different prenatal dvds and I usually prefer this one. The workout includes a good mix and I feel like I am getting something out of it. I just regret that it is so short. My other dvd is 50 mins long plus a guided meditation segment.,1491782400,2,243,3.979591836734694
