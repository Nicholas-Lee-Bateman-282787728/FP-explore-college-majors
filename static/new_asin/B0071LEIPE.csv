5047621,5,B0071LEIPE,"All I have read pointed to the captain of the SS Californian, Stanley Lord, as having failed in his duties for not coming to the aid of RMS Titanic on the night of 14-15 April 1912. Having seen this dvd, I now feel that his actions must be viewed in a different light. He reacted as the situation was viewed by him, and his crew, and in no way did he fail in his duties.

 Were mistakes made? Yes but mistakes made by both the Califorian and the Titanic. No one person should be made to carry the whole weight of blame. After 100 years of speculation we must look past that night, not forgeting the great loss in human life but knowing that because of it people may travel on the high seas in the certain knowledge that safety will never again take a back seat to profit.",1347494400,3,771,4.167785234899329
5047622,4,B0071LEIPE,"This is a fascinating DVD with Tim Maltin touring the world in pursuit of his theory that optical illusions (super-refraction) caused the Titanic lookouts not to see the iceberg until it was too late and the watch officers of the nearby Californian to misjudge the sort of ship they could see 10 miles away.  The best evidence in support is the German archive material which clearly shows that other ships in April 1912 passing the area where Titanic sank noted in their logs the strange phenomenon of super-refraction, false horizons etc.
  As other reviewers have noted,the weakness of the DVD is that it ignores the distant rockets seen by officers on the Californian.  Twist and turn as you may, the inaction of Captain Lord in these circumstances is serious.  Maybe the Californian could not have saved many lives if she had immediately steered towards those lights, but she could certainly have tried. That's the kernel of the argument against Lord.  Another oddity is the sheer number of heavenly, shining stars shown in the DVD.  Not a single space anywhere in the sky.  Were there really quite that many?
  Although Lord always denied that his officers saw the Titanic, the third officer Groves was certain she was in sight.  He said so at the official inquiries. The junior deck officer, Gibson, also thought at one point the distant steamer appeared to be listing.  Captain Lord died in 1962.  As a young trainee journalist I interviewed him a few months before he died.  I remember him telling me that the ship firing rockets could not have been the Titanic as she was moving.  The tragedy is that he didn't get off his settee to take a look.",1339200000,21,1654,4.754385964912281
5047623,2,B0071LEIPE,"'Titanic's Final Mystery' purports to answer questions regarding why the nearby Californian did not come to Titanic's aid, and why the Titanic's lookouts did not see the fatal iceberg until only 37 seconds away.

The Californian had stopped upon reaching the edge of a large ice field, and its radio operator, Cyril Evans, called to tell the Titanic of the situation. Unfortunately, the Titanic's on-duty radio operator was busy with personal messages to/from passengers and responded with 'Shut up, I am busy!' Evans went to bed, and ten minutes later the Titanic hit the iceberg.

Titanic's first distress call followed, 25 minutes later, followed by five rockets. Californian's Captain Lord was told, and responded to signal with the Morse lamp, but did not request wireless effort. The gist of the preceding was later confirmed by several sources. Lord later gave conflicting statements at ensuing inquiries. Both inquiries concluded that Captain Lord failed to provide proper assistance to the Titanic.

Director Nigel Levy, however, despite claiming to have exhaustively researched testimony from eyewitnesses, formulated an abstruse theory of reverse miraging that purports to explain why Captain Lord could have concluded the Titanic that he saw was actually a much smaller ship.

Similarly, Levy contends that rare atmospheric conditions (Fata Morgana) prevented spotting the iceberg earlier - supposedly the lookouts could see 30 minutes ahead (about 12 miles). But how? Levy also tells us it was a moonless night!

Other sources report that the Titanic's radio operators received six messages 4/14/12 from other ships warning of ice. Not all were relayed to ship's officers - turns out the radio operators did not work for White Star Line, but the Morse company. Regardless, the Titanic's speed was not reduced, and it continued at 25 mph. One survivor reported the see was so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected - now known as a sign of nearby pack ice. Had the sea been rougher, waves breaking against the icebergs would have made them more visible. Other evidence from experts reports that the steam-powered steering took up to 30 seconds to turn, and the center propeller was stopped, reducing the rudder's effectiveness. Had First Officer Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining speed, Titanic might have missed the iceberg.

Again, Levy ignored these sources, and utilized his same Fata Morgana theory (actually lifted from amateur historian Tim Maltin and an academic expert). While scientific experts have not rendered an opinion on the Levy/Maltin explanation, Wikipedia sources assert that such a mirage only occurs in the vertical dimension - thus, would not explain Captain Lord's claim that the ship he saw was too small (short) to be the Titanic.

Bottom-Line: Levy's explanation relies on selective extraction of material from subsequent eyewitness testimonies, violates the common-sense Principle of Parsimony, and represents egregious plagiarism. Further, it doesn't begin to excuse the facts that the Titanic had too few lifeboats, its radio operators did not act responsibly, the Californian's wireless should also have maintained operations, and that even knowing the Titanic didn't have enough lifeboats, they were launched without being near full. (Levy claims this was because passengers felt safer remaining on the ship - perhaps, but if so this would simply represent another failure of Captain Smith's leadership.) I do not understand why the Smithsonian would stand behind such sloppy and seemingly dishonest research.",1339113600,24,3574,5.405745062836624
5047624,4,B0071LEIPE,"If the information and data contained within is accurate, it goes a long way to explaining some of the odd happenings of the night of April 14, 1912 in that area of the Atlantic.
Video-wise, shots of the main character walking to various locations seems like filler and detract from the extremely fascinating scientific analysis. Tim Maltin did his homework and weaves eyewitness accounts with information provided by other ships in the area to construct a meterological scenario that plausibly explains how cold water (combined with warm air) ""mirage"" phenomena could have obscured the iceberg from two experienced, sharp-eyed lookouts. His theory also explains how similiar mirage phenomena befuddled the Captain and crew of the nearby steamer, the Californian, regarding the identity  of the Titanic, as well as confused morse signals relayed between the two ships, a mere 5-9 miles apart.

I could not rate 5 stars though, because in Maltin's desire to absolve Capt Lord of the Californian of inaction, Maltin does not address the fact that Titanic's (distress) rockets/flares were clearly seen by members of the Californian's crew and reported to Capt Lord. Instead of waking his wireless operator for clarification, he dismissed them and went back to sleep.

No cold water mirage theory can explain Lord's lack of curiosity or dereliction of duty as a ship's Captain in treacherous waters (Californian was stopped due to field ice), and his duty to investigate maritime distress. Perhaps Maltin could have saved the filler footage of his walking to various locations and devoted it to the controversity of the rockets and Lord's inaction.
However, this is smart stuff I highly recommend.",1335571200,31,1693,5.239852398523985

5047650,5,B0071LEIPE,"This investigation ranks up with the discovery of the wreck itself in importance. It describes how the atmospheric conditions of that night created an oceanic mirage that masked the berg against an obscured horizon on an otherwise crystal clear brilliant star lit night.  For years after the crash, the captain of the Titanic as well as the Californian were villified by the press and only now can have their names cleared with certainty. Human error was at work that night, but not in the ways we have been brought up to believe.  (I would suggest you listen to Lightoller's 1936 recorded interview available online to supplement this show).  So now we have the ship wreckage which suggests how the ship broke apart as she sank; this investigation which shows why the berg was not sighted in time, and clears the two captains of reckless behavior; why Morse lamps between the two ships could not be read; an explanation of why the flares were ignored by the Californian (available elsewhere); unfortunately the main human error is pointing to the telegraph operators on both the Californian and Titanic. The former for ommitting a crucial priority prefix on an ice warning and the latter for not getting these messages to the captain.  There has been much energy focused by the media on inferior iron rivets in recent years, but as this was the engineering standard of the time I think this concern will fade in to oblivion since the media now has fresh new quality material to feast upon. Certainly a new 'near definitive' documentary could be made putting all this info together. I just hope logic prevails and the rivets take the back row.",1435708800,,1643,4.815602836879433

5047661,5,B0071LEIPE,"This is one of the best DVDs about the Titanic disaster; combined with some other DVDs this makes my sets complete. Host  doesn't
dwell on rivets or steel quality or design ""flaws""; he believes the ship was sound for the period and probably would not have sunk
but for a series of odd events.  He goes into detail about things like the weather and the curious optical events that happened that
night and as to why the ""crows nest"" sailors did not see the ice berg until it was too late.  Its almost as if the ship was doomed from
the beginning.  Better communications would have helped; the wireless fellows went to  bed when perhaps they should have been
on duty all night due to the presence of  ice in the area. The captain of the ""California"" probably was not negligent as people thought
back then; he died with the guilt hanging over him.  Poor communications both between ships and between the wireless operators
and the officers on both ships helped contribute to the disaster.  The host even goes out in the area near the sinking and tested
the water temp both at or near the site and farther out.  If the ship had sunk just a few miles back and out of the cold water
currents, more people may have survived because the water was much warmer just a few miles back.  The ship hit the iceberg
in what is known as the Labrador Current, a lot of very cold water (and ice).  And cold water can cause mirages which is what
may have happened  to screen the iceberg from being seen.  He goes into much detail of how this could have worked; very
interesting..and creepy! To the Titanic buffs this is an ultimate DVD that must be had.  I got this from Amazon.  Enjoy-FIVE STARS!",1410566400,,1676,4.413680781758957

Even more compelling for the viewer is the credibility of the new case of explaining the sinking of the Titanic. The author sustains this credibility by securing it to verified evidence that was so blaring it leaves one truly mystified that it was missed by generations of researchers.

5047679,5,B0071LEIPE,"Just when you think there's nothing more to know about something - boom - someone comes up with something brilliantly new.

I'm not sure how I missed it but I've never heard this info. before.  Now that I have, I'm thinking, ""Of course!""  The whole thing is totally wild but it makes perfect sense. Either that or there were a whole lot of completely incompetent, apathetic liars in charge of things, who all happened to be together in a one tiny section of the north Atlantic, that night.

Is it ever possible that NO ONE is to blame when things go wrong in life?  In my experience, yes, it is.  It doesn't mean people don't try to assign blame; they do.  I guess it's easier to think that way than to accept that the sense of control, we so desperately need to believe we have, is all an illusion.  It's amazing to think that a situation SO large and SO tragic could actually be nobody's fault at all!!

My heart breaks for everyone who was blamed outright or, for the rest of their lives,  lived under a cloud of suspicion.  I'm not sure whether that would be better or worse than eternally blaming myself, while on some level knowing that I had done my job competently, perhaps even proudly, and had never lied about what happened and what I had or hadn't seen.  If it were me, I'd go back over the thing so many times in my mind, looking for answers that would never be there for me to grasp, that I'd probably go crazy on some level.  The cognitive dissonance and the magnitude of the loss would simply be too great for me.  I'd battle self-doubt until my dying day.

You know, you just can't make this kind of stuff up.",1392768000,,1626,4.32013201320132
5047680,4,B0071LEIPE,"This documentary espousing the theories of historian Tim Maltin basically absolves everyone involved, from the crew of the Titanic to Captain Stanley Lord of the nearby Californian, from responsibility for the sinking of the Titanic and the hundreds of lives lost in the disaster.  Mind you, Maltins theory is an interesting one, but this documentary goes too far in presenting this idea as fact  just as it errs in repeatedly asserting that Maltin was the first person to ever raise the idea regarding the Titanics sinking in the first place.  The same theory was raised  though not explored  by a British government inquiry in 1992.

Maltins approach is to look exclusively at the events and facts of the night of April 14-15, 1912  what survivors had to say during interviews and in testimony to boards of inquiry in both the U.S. and England and what the weather and ocean conditions were in that area of the Atlantic that night.  He tracks down information on conditions from the archived logs of nearby ships that passed through that area the same day as the Titanic, uncovering data that seem to jibe and explain the observations offered by a selective group of important eyewitnesses, such as the lookouts, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, passenger Lawrence Beesley, Captain Lord of the Californian, and others.  The theory, in a nutshell, is this: that atmospheric conditions, particularly the interaction of warm layers of air intersecting with the much colder air associated with the Labrador Current, created a cold mirage effect  basically an optical illusion caused by the refraction of light  that rendered the approaching iceberg invisible until it emerged out of a haze dead ahead of the vessel, too late to be avoided.  The moonless night, calm ocean, and bright stars all played into this atmospheric phenomenon.  As for Captain Lord on the Californian, the same atmospheric effect made the Titanic appear to be a much smaller ship, just as he testified.  Thus, Lord was convinced the ship he saw could not have been the Titanic.

Maltins theory sounds plausible and is certainly deserving of further attention and study, but the presentation of it in this documentary seems rather selective  both in terms of the survivor testimony he focused on and additional facts which aren't even acknowledged, much less addressed here.  For instance, this documentary makes Captain Smith out to be beyond reproach, when in fact his career was littered with numerous and significant accidents.  Maltin gives Smith a total pass on traveling at high speed through an area he knew to be rife with icebergs  yes, I know that is how things were done on clear nights back in those days, but numerous warnings should have given the captain pause.  It is the place of the Californian in this theory that bothers me the most, however.  For one thing, one can not say with complete confidence that the nearby ship sighted by many on the Titanic that night was the Californian and not a mystery ship.  To his dying day, Captain Lord insisted that the ship he observed from his deck was too small to be the Titanic  while Maltins theory accounts for just such an observation, his scintillation theory as to why the other ship did not respond to the Californians Morse signal lights is not overly convincing to me.  More importantly, though, this documentary fails to point out that the Titanic fired off numerous flares following the collision, thus completely side-stepping the question of how the captain of the nearby ship failed to notice them (apparently, in his book, Maltin uses the same light refraction theory to explain that the rockets would have appeared to be much lower in the sky than they actually were to those on the Californian).

I also must say that I wanted to hear what oceanographic experts had to say about Maltins theory, since he is essentially an historian making a scientific argument, but no such experts appear in the documentary.  Instead, we watch Maltin conduct tests just a few hundred yards offshore of Nova Scotia and interview boat operators who sail into the Labrador Current on a regular basis today.  Thats just not good enough for me.  Maltins theory may actually explain some or all of the reasons behind the Titanic tragedy  so, yes, this documentary is certainly worth watching  but in the end Im going to need more evidence before I can really buy into it.",1392422400,7,4401,4.916102841677943

Clear night. Brilliance of star light in the sky and dancing off the errily calm waters. The sudden and quite noticable change in the air temperature. With those conditions, the iceberg should have become visible sooner than it was.
There is a theory that the iceberg had rolled over at some point, presenting clear ice, rather than the white ice commonly seen. Its a thought.
The gashing along the side of Titanic for about 300 feet of her length, opening the interior of five water tight compartments, of course sealed it's fate.
