8548171,1,B00A85T8GY,"I am a long tern fan of Toots. Watching him t the nadir of his career/life brought me to tears.
I could not bear to watch more than the opening moments. I'll keep the DVD for another time when seeing it will not be so emotional.
So freaking sad.",1436400000,,245,4.020408163265306

8548174,5,B00A85T8GY,"Live at Le Chapiteau was released Mar 12, 2013 for the  90th birthday concert of Toots with his European Quartet and special guests Kenny Werner and Trijntje Oosterhuis .For over seven decades he has taken the harp from a novelty instrument to one of distinction and acceptability in many genres.
The bluray audio and video is of the highest quality.
