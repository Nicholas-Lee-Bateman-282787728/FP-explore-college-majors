3824359,5,B001W8FS92,"Gary Cooper at his best. Cooper plays a Texas Ranger chasing his prey in the North of Canada. Teamed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police he is on the trail of murderer wanted in the United States. The action is great and the acting is superb. If you ever saw The Plainsman, this has all the same elements; except in this one Cooper gets his man, not shot dead. A collector's must.",1351036800,19,383,4.333333333333333
3824360,4,B001W8FS92,"This pretty much has it all:  Cooper, beautiful women, great character actors, magnificent action scenes, splended scenery, and wonderful photography.  In short, it's well worth watching.  A fun film to see, and Preston is always great, as is Cooper.  A terrific movie dealing with loyalty and the consequences of betrayal.

3824387,5,B001W8FS92,"This DVD is like a visual historical novel.  In the Northwest Territory of Canada, during 1885, there was an uprising of the half-breeds.  There was a half-breed leader by the name of Jacque Corbeau and a pretender known as Louis Real.  As a producer Cecil B. DeMille (The Unconquered, The Bucaneer), provided another movie that combines Hollywood improvisation with history that reveals civilization as it was.  The half-breeds did try to incite native Canadian Indians to join their uprising - and failed.  The authentic portrayal of the NCMP (Northwest Canadian Mounted Police) in terms of protocol, uniforms and discipline were superb.  It is historic fact the Hudson Bay Co. shared forts with the NCMP.  It was quite common to have Indians, traders, trappers and half-breeds around those forts during the day, and to be escorted outside in the evening.  Regardless of age, any viewer can learn what it was like in 19th Century Canada.  Preston Foster and Robert Preston were exceptional in portrayal of a NCMP.  Gary Cooper acted in the role of Texas Ranger.  It was not unusual for our Law Enforcement to chase criminals across the border into Canada, and , a historical reality revealed about the excellent international relations the USA has with our Canadian neighbors and allies for decades.",1434412800,9,1301,5.061032863849765

3824418,5,B001W8FS92,"This is the best edition that I've found to date.  There were only three minor flaws that I noticed while watching the film this week; one I don't remember the details on, two that the beginning titles are a little hard to read as the writing/white color is weak, and thirdly that there is one nature scene that is out of register for approximately 5 to 10 seconds (a medium to long shot, second unit piece).  The color pops, the actor's are fine (as one should expect), and it's Mr. DeMille. It won't bore you to death.  I ordered my copy overnight on Monday/Tuesday (04-08-2014) and received it on Thursday (04-10-2014) via USPS, and it included tracking numbers, arriving from Florida to Oregon in that time.

Due to the mediocre UI/Menu, I can't give it 5 stars.  But, The main thing is the picture quality, which is good.
