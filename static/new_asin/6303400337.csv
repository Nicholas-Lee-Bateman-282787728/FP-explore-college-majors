Equipped with tools bestowed upon them by nature the predators are shown to maintain the ecosystem and live in harmony with it. No doubt this video won 3 international awards.

Highly highly recommended for any avid wild life fan.

Anybody who sees this video will conceed that God is the greatest scientist of all.",1110326400,2,452,4.782051282051282
