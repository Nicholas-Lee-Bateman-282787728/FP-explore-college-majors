2335246,2,B0009XRZ9M,"I have been looking forward to this film for a couple of years now since I first heard about its upcoming realease on animated-movies.com and may I say was highly disappointed by the trailer. When I saw the first snip of animation I immediately thought that it was live action but with some odd touch. As Mr. Zemmicks has attempted to create an almost believable world on the computer I wonder ""why not just create it and film it?"". It would look a lot better and would be way cheaper to produce.
Aside from the animation there was very little else to comment on inside the trailer. There were very few lines spoken and very few scenes shown. Since this was a full-leignth trailer I would definitely considder this to be a hint towards what to expect of the quality of the film. With Mr. Zemmicks amazing directing abilities I would have expected a lot of expansion on the children's book's themes and storylines, but it doesn't appear to be so.
Although this might be a fun holiday movie to go see simply for the sake of seeing a Christmas film, I would definitely not recommend it for viewing outside of that purpose.
If one were considdering going to see this movie simply to see some of the ground-breaking realistic animation I would say you probably won't be disappointed. It's not perfect, but it's miles beyond even what PIXAR has thus accomplished. But aside from the animation, there doesn't appear to be much story or anything else.

2335665,3,B0009XRZ9M,"A boy, suspicious of Santas existence, dreams or hallucinates that a train has pulled up in front of his house on Christmas Eve.  When he investigates he meets a snarky conductor who doesnt care whether he boards this Polar Express, or not.  He does, or there wouldnt have been much of a movie.  At the next stop theres a poor boy also reluctant to board.  Christmas doesnt mean much to him because Santa has never visited his house.  But hes willing to go along for the ride.  The ride turns into a roller coaster experience that eventually takes them to their destination.  Do they really meet Santa or is this only an adventure that dreamer Dorothy could appreciate?  A bell holds the answer.

Artistically speaking, it is visually stunning.  The score, by Alan Silvestri, is lovely.  But.  The story is severely limited in scope and understanding of the holiday and children.  As for the motion-capture effect used on the people, it is, as others have observed, incredibly creepy and lifeless.  The eyes are troubling, the way their mouths don't work correctly is freaky and distracting.",1516060800,,1091,4.827027027027027

2335973,5,B0009XRZ9M,"First I will start by saying that I never give spoilers in any of my movie reviews. I keep it simple and say whether it is good or not.

I pretty much purchased this movie just to add another 3D title to my movie collection. So needless to say I had it for quite a while before ever viewing it. However after viewing this movie, We wish we had watched it sooner! Our entire family found the movie very well done. The story line was whimsical and at times a real treat. I would consider this to be a great movie for the entire family, including the very young ones. Also, this movie would be enjoyable any time of the year!
 The 3D aspect was done very well. I have seen better but this by no means was poor. There where a few times when the 3D was a little underwhelming and I may have noticed a slight ghosting here and there but all in all a pretty decent 3D rendering is what you can expect. Please keep on mind that not all 3D Televisions are made the same and some 3D TV's just aren't very good at displaying 3D. Luckily we have a good 3D TV that shows a great 3D image. So when a 3D movie is played on our television, it is a very special treat as we can expect it to play just about as good as most any theatre can provide us. I have a vast 3D collection and have viewed most of them, so you can trust my advice when I say that this 3D movie is one of the better ones available.

I will sum this review up with this advice. If you are at all on the fence about whether you should buy this movie or not, I would suggest you do, and enjoy it.

2336293,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Are you tired of the classic Christmas Movies? Looking for a feature that encompasses the essence of believing? Polar Express is guaranteed to enrapture young kids to adults taking them on a journey filled with action, thriller, comedy, musical, mystery, family, and fantasy.  Polar Express is an amazing 1 hour and 39 minutes animated movie featuring the voices of Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis. The storyline follows a young boy at the brink of debunking the essence of ""Santa Clause."" When all of sudden a magical train ride appears taking him on a journey of believing once again. The movie has an underlying theme of friendship, bravery, and caring. It is an excellent movie for the home and for the classroom.
Want to use it in your classroom? There are several paper based resources available that align to the movie.
This was my first time renting a movie using Amazon Video. I was hopeful and sceptic in the logistics of clicking ""rent"" and the variability of it playing without trouble the next day while in the classroom. But it worked amazingly-never freezing or lagging. I rented the movie for a fraction of the overall cost of purchasing. The rules stated I had 30 days to start watch, and 24 hours to finish once started.
This was no cause for concern. I purchased the movie the day before. Once in the classroom I was able to open Amazon.com and went straight to my rented videos. I began the movie with no problems. I even had to stop the video several times throughout the day and each time it resumed exactly where we stopped.
This was a wonderful experience renting form Amazon Movies and for the price it was an excellent and easy decision. I plan on using this for my family nights. Next on our list is Secret Life of Pets for $4.99. You can't beat $4.99 for two adults and multiple kids! And just think, you don't have to miss the movie when you need to use the restroom!!
Great resource for those family movie nights or classroom needs.",1483228800,,1960,4.616045845272207

The extra footage added to show how the movie was made and what they did to make it is excellent.

2336833,1,B0009XRZ9M,"I didn't watch the entire movie because I found the first part disturbing. The train conductor was so harsh with the children, and the children were directed into situations that I always warn my children to avoid - for example allowing an adult male to take them to an isolated place were ""punishment"" will be doled out. The dynamic of innocent children versus authoritative, excessively stern adult was really off putting to me. I was disappointed because this movie has so many fans and I was looking forward to an upbeat holiday flick.
I am not sure if I'll ever sit down to watch the movie all the way through but the rest of it will have to be pretty good to make up for the troubling portions in the beginning.",1482105600,,717,4.480916030534351

I like owning it in my library because I can speed through less favorite parts like the scary lost toy train car and through the train hobo part, which always seems like it doesn't belong in the film.

However with a little one the convenience of watching it at home was great, allowing us to start and stop it as needed. We even watched it a second time the next morning - paid one, watched it twice. Even better was watching the excitement in my daughter's face during several of the scenes. I expect the tradition to continue for many years!",1482019200,,456,4.573170731707317

Purchased in October so that we would have it to watch in December, and since we didn't open the dang thing and test it when we got it, we have missed the window to ship it back. So we are stuck with a movie that won't work, but are out of luck. Beware, open disks and make sure they work when you get them or you won't be able to send it back for credit. Who would have known that you would need to open a disk that you would give as a gift. Classy. Sold by Amazon LLC.",1481760000,,583,3.8666666666666667

2337018,5,B0009XRZ9M,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I rented the movie last week for my 6 year old grandson to watch because I took him on the Chicago Union Station Polar Express Train. What an experience something he would never forget. When Santa came out and gave him a bell they talked. My grandson turned and looked at me he said Ma i will never forget this day or you. I about cried very touching. He remembered everything from the movie and noticed the same on the train. At the end of the ride he said Ma why didn't the train go to the North Pole. Priceless moment and something he and I will cherish,1481500800,2,601,4.189655172413793

2337035,1,B0009XRZ9M,"This is a great movie ruined by Tom Hanks. His ego said no one else could play the parts but him. A close examination of most of the characters shows you he dominates the characters. I am surprised he didn't play the female parts.
Like most movies someone forgets to keep the story making sense. They make it more about the scenes rather than a continuous story. Then they run out of time and have to rush the ending. Every version of this movie is a visual winner. If you get to watch it in 3D you see why 3D is awesome. If you know someone with 3D TV watch this movie. If that doesn't convince you the value of 3D TV then nothing will. Someone else could have played the parts and done an excellent job making it the movie it should have been. Someone please do a remake. Get other people to do the parts and show Mr. Hanks and his giant EGO that he isn't the only actor with talent.",1481414400,,885,4.121387283236994

Some scenes are totally pointless (what is the point of that stupid scene where the waiters are dancing on the table to deliver the hot chocolate?)  The whole point of the story is that most kids don't believe in Santa and this kid starts to believe, which is good, but if you have little kids who still believe, this movie may make them question it.",1481414400,,424,4.367088607594937

Started watching this movie the year it was made and my first granddaughter was born.  A few years later, she started watching with me.
Ever since, it's been one of the 4-5 Christmas movies we MUST watch every year.
Just got a new copy on Blu-Ray, and it's lovely (holds up even 12 years later).
Like others have said, you need to watch it all to take in the messages and appreciate it.
It's not rude, crude, or otherwise shocking in any fashion - just good fun and a positive message without being at all preachy.

Some movies stand the test of time - Tom Hanks no doubt has a lot to do with the charms of this movie and I hope one day my granddaughter watches it with her kids.

Happy Holidays all - whether it Christmas or other celebration.  Anyone can appreciate the messages and fun of this movie.  Peace to all.",1480982400,,835,4.292993630573249

2337200,1,B0009XRZ9M,"The graphics were very cheesy and it's obvious that this is an older movie.  Fortunately I don't have small children anymore, if I did I am pretty sure this would have been a disaster because it is way too scary for small children.  Lots of scenes where kids have become abandoned or lost, some scenes where problems with the train or the bridge or the tracks bring everyone to the brink of disaster, it's way too much for children under the age of 8 or 9.  And yet for kids older than 8 or 9 it's not entertaining because they basically took a 12 page childrens' book and had to make a 90 minute movie out of it.  There just isn't enough material to hold anyone's interest.",1480636800,,674,4.283464566929134

2337232,5,B0009XRZ9M,"First saw this in IMAX upon release, no viewing since had ever topped that experience. Having owned the DVD and seen multiple times on TV, just didn't do this wonderful movie justice. Had been tempted to buy the standard Blu-Ray but never did, but upon seeing there was this 3D version, the price was right and figured it had to be an improvement over DVD.

And thankfully, it is! Having read some negative reviews on the 3D quality, I am my own judge on some things, plus you can't always take another's word for it. I have a 3D HDTV and 3D Blu-Ray player, and tend to try to buy movies which help make the most of the system, and I was very pleased to find so much of that original IMAX experience was captured here. Nothing could top that, of course, but this was right up there. Picture was clear as a bell, sound was terrific, and the 3D was fantastic.

I read about a previous 3D release that had come with some cheap cardboard glasses, this is NOT that version. You also get a ton of special features along with the standard 2D version, all on the same Blu-Ray disc. I guess there within lies my only complaint, is perhaps the entire 3D presentation would have benefited just that little bit more if it did not all have to share space on the one disc. But a pretty weak complaint otherwise.",1480118400,,1297,4.333333333333333

The story obviously goes beyond what the book covers but its done well and I love the images in the movie that mesh so well with the illustrations in the book! The wolves in the snow, the top of the north pole, and the bells look remind you of the books illustration.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

This is a very well produced and by now a classic for Christmas.  In my experience, it has involved more than just children and it acquires the power to give a feeling of warmth as it is played year after year.

It is also extremely well made.",1464652800,,441,4.4625

I also have a 10 year old who is right at that age for not believing in Santa. I give credit to this movie for helping her believe a little longer.  By the time the movie is over, I'm a believer!!  I love the graphics, I love that it is action packed with winter scenes as they charge on to the North Pole.  I watched this movie before I had children, and thought it was awesome.

2337485,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I wish directors would understand that no grown up actor can naturally move like a child, so some of the scenes just looked forced since Tom Hanks provided the motions. Billy looked the most natural, but some things just can't be replicated by an adult. Caribou do not make that sound---elks do. And with the exception of the Michael Jeter elf, I found the elves the most annoying and not really attractive or charming in any way. I'm sure they were patterned after the people who worked on the film, but I would've preferred loveable jolly elves...especially if they are going to speak Yiddish then make them sweet, not obnoxious. Didn't need the Steven Tyler song or scene. Beautiful score, but the hobo character was creepy. We always skip the marionette sequence as it's just too much for young ones... love the hot chocolate scene! The best part of this movie is the utilization of ""old time"" Christmas music with Bing and Frank and Perry and the Andrews Sisters and Kate Smith etc... But kids want Santa to be fun and merry, not stiff and weird looking...couldn't they hire an actor who looked like Santa instead of Tom Hanks and his low voiced rendition? I feel the animators spent so much time on some details but forgot obvious ones like the fact that most children have a full set of eyelashes and people blink a lot compared to what these CG characters did. Children squirm and rub eyes and noses etc.. they are not as robotic as these ""kids""... I think the falling snow and the train were the best animated things in the movie. Oh yes and the screaming engineer thing...all I can say is I thank God for the mute button!!!!",1462492800,,1634,4.580204778156997

2337572,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Although I will always love the storybook even better than the movie, the movie was well done.  Sometimes it seems that the story-line was a stretch in places, but this is understandable considering that they took a 10 minute picture book and made a full length movie from it.  Love the music and the animation.  It is a great kid friendly movie that doesn't have any of the language, violence, etc. that we try to avoid.",1457049600,,421,4.5131578947368425

2337582,5,B0009XRZ9M,I usually don't recommend movies that emphasize Santa themes but with some guidance as to substituting the Santa in this movie with God and Jesus then it can be a valuable resource. I believe the word Santa having the same lettering as Satan is not by coincidence. The lies we give to children about Santa take away their ability to believe in the truth about Christmas.,1456876800,,370,4.621212121212121

Some of the concepts were a little above my 4 year old twins' heads, but they were still entertained.  There were also a few parts that were a bit scary for them, but again, overall a very good, and enjoyable movie.

2337652,3,B0009XRZ9M,3D review only..after watching and owning hundreds of 3D movies I was excited to watch this classic in 3D ..there were some great 3D out of screen effects and depth in this movie ..the frozen lake scene is super .but the reason I'm giving this movie a 3 star rating and it not making my top 20 list is because I noticed a considerable amount of ghosting especially in the background. .this is an older 3D movie and the 3D technology is alot better now then it was 12 years ago..my equipment is a profesionally calibrated samsung 80 inch suhd 4k 3D led tv with Active  glasses from 9 feet away..dead center of screen with a 4k up converting blu-ray player and paradigm surround system with 12 inch paradigm sub..if it wasn't for the ghosting it would have been a top 10 movie in my 3D collection for sure..,1454889600,3,805,4.402684563758389

The character animations are not quite real enough to be perceived as living people yet also go too far at trying to make them look alive. They come off as these ""soulless"" animated automatons. I think it distracts from the movie.",1454544000,,434,4.37037037037037

2337733,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express is a movie I have been searching for the past few years. Red box, Netflix, hulu, and the others never have it so this year I decided to purchase it. I looked at Best Buy, Walmart and other major resellers but the price here was unbeatable.  It is probably the first movie I have actually purchased in the past 5 years. I have such good memories watching it with my nephew growing up.  I am very excited to continue the tradition with my daughter next year.
This movie is a great buy for the whole family. And it is insanely reasonably priced on here. I highly suggest grabbing a bowl of popcorn and a mug of hot chocolate to enjoy this flick with the whole family. Let everyone wear their pajamas and put your phones away.
  The plot is deep enough that I think that each family member comes away from the movie with a different understanding and appreciation of the film. It is one that is deeper than most children can grasp but has a fun story of imagination. It is interesting to see what your loved ones take away from it. The colors and characters are beautiful. The movie brings up all different kinds of emotions and family dialogue.  You will get to remember the innocence of your childhood and recognize the milestones we have all passed growing up.

2337757,5,B0009XRZ9M,"We loved this amazing movie. Especially my 8 year old. The good news is that you won't get tired of watching for at least the first 3 or 4 times each year. Unless they happen to be in the same day. 2 weeks into watching it daily, well then you might get a teensy bit of a tic by your right eye. But hey, admit it by that time most movies have you curled up in a corner wondering how you are going to bear it for another 2 weeks. This one piece of cake. At that point just hide it and promise a Polar Express Train Ride if they are good. (All hopped up and Christmas Cheer and the ubiquitous cookies and candy, parties and the promise of SANTA at the end... they will never make it the next 2 weeks being good so you can always find an excuse for not doing that one.) Tell them that you put it up so that the train ride would feel fresh and exciting instead of old and stale. You can get through the next 2 weeks in peace! Unless you happen to have ""Barney"" DVD's accessible then you are toast and may as well just check into a spa before you burn the house down or something drastic.

Full Disclosure: I talked Grandma into doing the Polar Express Ride so I got to keep my promise without having to pay for it.

2337794,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Oh, if only for ghosting.....

It pains me to sit here knowing what I am about to write.
Warner Bros. was extremely gracious to send me a handful
of screeners to review knowing that I would be promoting
the good word of 3D on this forum.  However, when there
seems to be a problem with their initial batch of Blu-ray
releases I can't morally sit here and praise them to the
membership.

Their Imax release of Under The Sea looks terrific.
However, their Imax release of Space Station 3D is
lacking 3D in the first 3 minutes.  Now, The Polar Express
is exhibiting its own set of problems.  I sort of wonder
if anyone is doing some quality control here.

I'll get into all this in a moment....

I had to chuckle when I decided I was going to review
this title.  It took me back a few years to our last Home
Theater Forum meet.  The studio sent us an advance copy
of their initial 3D DVD release of The Polar Express and we
were showing it off in our demo room at the hotel.  Here
we were, a ragtag group of enthusiasts with cardboard
glasses on our faces admiring the cheesy 3D.

Boy, we have come a long way in a few short years.

Potentially, The Polar Express could have been a
flagship animated feature release for the studio on
the 3D format.  Originally filmed for Imax with
motion capture technology,  The Polar Express
translates beautifully to Blu-ray.  This was my
very first time watching the movie ever and I
was completely mesmerized by the film's charming
story and utterly stunning, realistic animation.

Transfer quality is as good as it gets.  I love
the film's warm, natural color palette consisting
primarily of blue and gold. Everything looks
perfect here.

The quality of the 3D separation is quite good
and very effective.  I have three favorite scenes
where I found the 3D effect to be most effective.
The first involves a floating train ticket.  Then
there's an exciting train descent into Glacier Gulch.
Finally, the entire Christmas Town square sequence
looks outstanding with all its brightly lit colors and
3D dimensionality.

There really aren't any ""In Yo' Face"" 3D moments.
Most of the material stays within the confines of
the screen with the exception of some minor screen
protruding from the fender of the train or the cap
of the train's hobo.

So here we have this immaculate, gorgeous holiday
eye-fest that would have looked perfect on 3D if not
for the fact that it is marred with ghosting problems.

It doesn't take long to notice the problem.  The first
scene where the young boy is lying in bed you see
double imaging within his face.  When this same boy
steps onto the Polar Express, takes his seat and meets
the black girl, you can see double imaging going on
within her facial features.  Some behind-the-head shots
reveal ghosting in the ears and along the hairline.
Watch the scene where the kids are being pulled up
inside Santa's sack and see how the ropes are
double-imaged.  In fact, there are moments that
I actually experienced eye strain from the amount
of ghosting and occasional blurriness.

The DTS-HD audio lovingly conveys Alan Silvestri's
score which is mostly prominent in the front channels.
This is a very bass-heavy audio track.  The oncoming
sound of The Polar Express literally shook my floor.

Like all of Warner's new 3D releases, The Polar
Express arrives in beautiful lenticular packaging.

CONCLUSION

Ultimately, I am disappointed.  This is such a beautiful
film and as much as the 3D enhanced my initial experience
with it, the ghosting issues became a big distraction.

I am sitting here hoping that someone can prove me
wrong on all the ghosting problems I see with this title.
The last thing I want to do is slam the studio for a title
like this.  However, up until now I have been seeing some
great 3D content with none of these problems.  I even
switched out my glasses for another pair just in case it
was a hardware issue.",1453075200,11,3897,4.629737609329446

I'd call it a scam at best!  To Amazon's credit, they pulled it from sale and also gave quick credit for returns.  It comes with goofy 1950's style cardboard glasses and do NOT function!  We have new Sony XBR 75"" 4K/3D TV that gives the message that there is no 3D signal from the Sony 3D Blue Ray player ... and same from the Blue Ray player.  There is absolutely no way to adjust settings on the TV or player to make this scam disk function!",1452988800,,613,4.066666666666666

2337813,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Love the movie but had to order another one to get the proper format. When I ordered this specific item, I selected and it was confirmed that I was purchasing the ""Multi-format"" version. Every other ""multi-format"" I've ordered in the past has had all versions of the film i.e., Blu Ray, Dvd, and digital hd download. So when I ordered this in multi-format, I expected the above trio of options to be included. It was also very misleading because there was a blu Ray option, dvd option, and multi-format option. So knowing what I had ordered in the past and the choices in front of me I chose the multi format and didn't think twice.  When it arrived it was just blu Ray so I couldn't play it in our car DVD player for my son when I had hoped to. I turned around and had to order the DVD version as well. I think there definitely needs to be some re-wording or more clarification to let the buyer/customer know for sure what they are purchasing. In the end I now have both the blu Ray and DVD and the movie itself is phenomenal and my 2 year old loves it!",1452556800,,1054,4.243781094527363

If this film had come out even a decade before it did, it would be hailed as one of the great Christmas movies of all time, but CGI and the related computer animation has made us mostly dead to wonder these days. This is a great film, probably will be hailed as one of the top ones in the future, all from a pretty simple children's book. The scene with the wolves alone is worth the price of purchase. What has kept this movie out of the very top ranks is the mildly creepy animation, but that will change with time.",1451520000,,546,4.11214953271028

He is three and just now interested in movies, he loves trains and I knew he would be a fan of the Polar Express.  I was right, he absolutely adores it and watched it about twice a day during the month of December.  We are burnt out on it now but I expect it will be a big part of our Christmas for years to come.

2338009,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Polar Express
It's Christmas Eve and one boy is waiting up, pretending to be asleep. However, his faith is waning. Is Santa real? If so, will he be coming? He just isn't sure. Suddenly, train tracks appear in front of his house along with a steam locomotive powered train called Polar Express. The conductor has the boy on his passenger manifest. The boy asks where the train is going? ""Why, to the North Pole, of course!"" comes the conductor's response. The boy hesitates and the train begins to move, without him. The boy decides to jump on and so the journey begins.
We never find out most of the children's names, but the message of the film is more important to the screenwriter. To most people, seeing is believing, but sometimes, what you can't see is more real. About half the film is the adventure and mishaps of the train traveling to the North Pole and three children becoming friends.
We have our doubting boy, our self-assured, faith intact girl and a defeatist boy, who believed, but for whom, ""Christmas just doesn't work out.""
When they arrive at the North Pole, a bit of clumsiness sends our heroes on an adventure in the ""behind the scenes"" workings of the North Pole.
Lovely CG animation and a timeless story. Intended for young audiences, but adults like it too. Tom Hanks is the narrator and the conductor. A good film to make into a holiday tradition.",1450137600,,1373,4.631147540983607

2338017,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Unfortunately, I can't offer the love that this CG animated movie receives here from so many. As an somewhat early effort in animating realistic humans, it's a failure. Zemeckis's film comes from deep, deep in uncanny valleythe characters don't move correctly, the faces are stiff and unreal, the eyes unalive. But I still enjoy watching it as an entertaining spectacle. It is, in its way, just so exuberant and over-the-top the one can't take one's eyes off it. I could watch the hot chocolate pouring scene over and over again. Couldn't do that in live action. Mesmerizing. And the train's passage through ridiculous landscapes is impressive, to say the least. I don't buy into its saccharine Christmas sentimentality, but if it floats your boat, good for you. (Give me Geo. C. Scott's Christmas Carol or A Christmas Story or Tokyo Godfathers or Nightmare Before Christmas any day.)

I watched it again the last couple of nights after my wife went to bed; she can't stand to look at it, gives her ""the creeps."" And despite its failings, it's a unique and worthwhile filmin its strange, strange ways.",1450051200,,1101,4.887700534759358

The Polar Express has also been added to the list so its movies, movies, Christmas Dinner, movies, snacks and more movies.

What got me the most about this movie was when someone said to me that he took his Grandchildren to watch it and said it was a 'kids' movie. He has forgotten to 'believe'.

2338112,1,B0009XRZ9M,"Some of these reviews are misleading because they are talking about the 3D version that does not come with the red and blue glasses.  Apparently that version is much better than the one that has red/blue glasses in the case.  I got the latter, with the glasses, and it is heavily distorted with a ghost image and is unwatchable.  The movie titled ""The Polar Express presented in 3-D"" is the version you want to avoid.  The front cover shows a child standing in the snow looking at the front of the train.  The one I'm told is really 3-D has a child on top of the train as it goes over a bridge on the front cover.  It is titled ""The Polar Express 3-D.",1448755200,,651,4.209677419354839

Though the only scene which I feel is ambiguous and redundant, when the children see the broken toys in the first compartment of the train.. And when one soft-toy clown tries to pull the protagonist. It unnecessarily scares children and I don't see a clear message of learning to children.. About protecting their toys maybe!!!",1444176000,,522,4.747252747252747

2338281,3,B0009XRZ9M,"So we had never seen this before when we decided to watch it with our little girl. She loves trains so seemed like a win/win. We may have accidentally ruined her love of trains. The movie was too scary for her. She asked us to turn it off during several parts, which we ended up just distracting her for thinking they wouldn't last long. The train ride is very adventurous and maybe a little bit too much for some young kids, but you know your kid best.",1443139200,5,453,4.218390804597701

2338283,1,B0009XRZ9M,"My child is a huge fan of the book and could not wait to watch this movie after we found it on Prime.  Not even halfway through, the look on his face changed from joy to fear.  Finally it got to the point where he asked us to stop the movie.  Being a fan of the book as well, I continued to watch the film, but could not finish.  As with any book turned into a movie, I expected some liberties to be taken, but the director/producer added such dark elements to the film that it destroyed the fundamental story line and overshadowed the spirit of Christmas. They took a beautiful story that my child and I know and love and turned it into a creepy, scary movie that I would not recommend to anyone.  What should have been a holiday movie classic in our home that the family could watch each season, will now be a movie that I hope my son will be able to forget.",1443139200,8,860,4.095238095238095

I could not only hear the bells, I could see his sleigh in the night sky. Chris Van Allsburg is to be commended for writing an excellent fantasy and Tom Hanks for conducting the wonder tour to beat them all. The special effects are just outstanding, the story line credible and heartwarming. The characters are believable and utterly charming. The children depicted are our own. I would recommend this film to any and all who love Christmas and remember what it is to believe. The experience of watching makes you a participant, breathless to see what comes next. I can hardly wait to view it on IMAX and am taking my entire family, including seven grandchildren to the Tulsa Cinemark this season.

In the middle of summer, it was on Instant Prime so I streamed it for my 18 month old grandson, and he LOVED it.  It is so visually pleasing to look at for both children and adults and the 'animation,' if that's what you can call it, is realistic and well acted.

2338509,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is a great movie that I enjoy watching with my three-year-old son.  It's about a boy who boards a magical Christmas train called the Polar Express on the night before Christmas.  He meets two new friends, one of whom has never received a gift from Santa Claus.  The main character has lost his belief in Santa, but is a kind soul who repeatedly helps the boy who hasn't gotten a gift from Santa.  The train takes all its passengers to the North Pole where they meet Santa after a ton of adventure.  It's based on a children's book by the same name I read in elementary school.  My son loves trains and Santa Claus, so he loves this book.  I enjoy the messages in the movie that my son is absorbing.  I'd recommend it for any child in the Santa Claus age range.

The movie came quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well.",1436745600,,831,4.303225806451613

2338575,4,B0009XRZ9M,"First, a few words about the movie and a word of explanation from your humble reviewer.  ""The Polar Express"" is one of those computer animations that try to look as photorealistic as possible in their representations of the actual world.  As a result, the humans appear almost but not quite real, like wax figures in a museum come to life.  I've never understood this concept, which makes everyone look kind of creepy to me.  If the studio figured to save money using the CGI animation technique as opposed to using live actors, saving money didn't work.  This 2004 production cost about $150,000,000 to make.  If the filmmakers figured the animation would provide some visual treats we couldn't otherwise get with live action, well, it doesn't do any more than one of today's comparable live-action CGI fantasies does.  If director Robert Zemeckis hoped to open our minds better to the world of imagination, the movie does so at cross purposes.  Would ""Willy Wonka"" or ""Harry Potter"" have been any better done in animation than in live action?  I doubt it.  When I finished watching ""The Polar Express"" the first time I saw it, I remember being left intrigued by the visuals but wondering why the filmmakers did it as a cartoon when they could have accomplished the same thing in live action without looking so...odd.  Therefore, please, temper my remarks with this preliminary grousing in mind; and understand that the animation will probably not bother most anyone else.

Zemeckis based the movie on a short, illustrated children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  Zemeckis, as you know, is the fellow who gave us such spectacularly creative delights as ""Back to the Future,"" ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" and ""Contact,"" all of them filled with fascinating characters and glorious visual sights.  In ""Polar Express,"" however, the director stretches (an unkinder soul would say bloats) a simple story idea with so many visual effects that some of the characters get rather lost in the proceedings.

The animation technique produces varied results.  The scenery and surroundings are exquisite, imaginatively rendered in every detail, especially in high def, often looking like one of those Christmas globes with the snow swirling around inside; and from everything I can ascertain, the animation does a good job capturing the look and feel of the paintings in Van Allsburg's book.  It's the people who inhabit this world who look artificial in a spooky sort of way.  The filmmaking process that Zemeckis used requires live actors to perform their roles and then computer animators to duplicate their actions.  It's the modern equivalent of the early rotoscoping done by pioneer animators in the days of silent films.  Although it's quite a bit more advanced now, the basic idea is the same.  What I always have to ask, though, is if live actors perform the parts, why not make it a live-action movie?  What more does animation do to make something a fantasy?  Is the mere act of watching drawings instead of real people oblige us to believe all the more in a film's make-believe?  Well, it may, and if it works for you, more power to the filmmaking.

The plot, what little there is of it, concerns a young boy at an age where he's about to lose his belief in Santa Claus and the magic of Christmas.  In this most crucial year of his life, the Polar Express, Santa's personal train, shows up at his doorstep one Christmas Eve to convince him there really is a Santa.  Other children of a similar age and with similar feelings of disbelief fill the train.  From here, the movie offers a sweet and moving fable of regaining (or retaining) one's faith in the Christmas spirit, as the boy learns to be kind to other people and never lose his power of imagination.  No complaints here.

Tom Hanks stars in the movie, and stars in the movie, and stars in the movie.  He is the voice behind most of the main characters, which works well for several reasons.  First, he's a fine actor and provides good voice characterizations for, among others, the boy's father, the train conductor, a mysterious hobo, and Santa himself.  Second, having Hanks voice so many of the characters makes it feel all the more like storybook time, as though one person alone were telling the tale; which, in fact is the case, as Hanks also voices the boy grown up, looking back on his own childhood.

I enjoyed the other characters voices as well, all of them ably, if not always so colorfully, voiced:  Nona Gaye as a little girl that the boy befriends; Leslie Zemeckis as the boy's sister Sarah; Peter Scolari as a shy, lonely boy; and, best of all, Eddie Deezen as an annoying, know-it-all kid.  You'll recognize Deezen's distinctive voice instantly from things like ""1941"" and ""WarGames.""  He practically saves the day by being the most unique and entertaining voice of all the characters in the movie.  Every time he appears, the movie livens up.

The action of the story takes places almost entirely on the train and then at the North Pole in a series of short episodes.  These brief segments involve the boy in various adventures, none of which are particularly involving because of their brevity.  After a somewhat slow start, the episodes begin to come along rather quickly, and it's shortly afterwards that we realize there's not going to be much more to it than that; nothing lasts long enough to develop much tension, and there aren't many clear transitions between events to sustain an engrossing story line.

Zemeckis possibly intended the rapid succession of incidents to remind us of a child's dream, because certainly it never induces us to believe the boy is awake while all this is going on.  Nevertheless, I found my mind wandering at times, maybe indicating I'm not a child anymore.

Several of the segments have a rousing spirit, though, and they display a verve sometimes lacking in the rest of the film.  There is a scene with dancing waiters and a song, ""Hot Chocolate,"" that comes alive in an energetic, Monty Pythonesque way; there's a stunning shot of an eagle flying through a gorge that is lovely enough to frame; there's a sequence with the train sliding down a roller-coaster track and then slipping sideways on an expanse of ice that is really quite harrowing; and there is a passage set in a roomful of puppets that is scary in the way only puppets and marionettes can be scary.

But offsetting these instances of beauty and excitement are too many songs that seem less than memorable (""Believe"" being the main one); too much background music that tries to be uplifting and inspirational and comes off gushy; too much pacing that is awkward and herky-jerky; too much that should be surreal that only seems tedious; too much that is simply sentimental; and too little storyline to tie it all together.

The moviemakers might better have called the film ""The Bipolar Express,"" with so much that is sweet and light on the one hand and so much that is tiring and humdrum on the other.  I liked the movie's first half a lot; I found the second half going on and on rather slowly.  Although I have no doubt most kids and many adults will love it, this Scrooge came away with somewhat mixed feelings.

Video:
My friend and fellow movie critic Eddie Feng and I once discussed two issues related to this film.  Namely, (1) the inability of animators to realize fully the nuances of real human faces and (2) the relative ease in capturing animated characters on disc as compared to capturing the subtleties of human faces.  The result is that ""The Polar Express"" looks more realistic than most animated movies but not quite realistic enough to pass for the real thing.  Nevertheless, like it or not, it shows up gloriously in 2-D high definition.

However, since the disc contains both a 2-D and a 3-D version of the movie and since the 3-D is the main attraction here, let's start with that format first, the special 3-D process rendered by Sony Pictures Imageworks.  Because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the Wife-O-Meter's favorite films, she was anxious to watch it in its new three-dimensional trappings.  So, we dutifully put on the red-and-blue 3-D glasses and attempted to enjoy the picture.  No dice.  The same thing happened that I had experienced with previous 3-D films.  I wear eyeglasses for distance, and the 3-D cardboard-and-cellophane frames would not fit comfortably over or under my regular glasses.  I resorted to cutting one pair of 3-D glasses apart and taping them to my own glasses, but it still didn't work.  The 3-D glasses were always uncomfortable, and the 3-D picture was always out of focus, with quite a bit of ghosting going on.  The Wife-O-Meter fared no better.  She doesn't wear glasses, but she has had her eyes surgically corrected, with one eye adjusted for reading and one for distance.  She could never focus on the 3-D picture, always coming up with two different images slightly apart.

Worse still, in 3-D neither of us saw the brilliant colors we had become used to in the 2-D editions.  Instead, we found a dull sheen, like a veil, over the hues.  After fifteen or twenty minutes we both agreed to give up on the ghosting effects and the veiled colors, and we watched the movie in regular 2-D.

One could hardly fault any part of the Blu-ray 2-D presentation.  The video engineers retained the movie's 2.40:1 widescreen dimensions in a 1080p, VC-1 transfer that looks identical to the HD DVD encode.  (An insider friend told me it is, indeed, the same encode.)  The colors are deep and the overall focus is as sharp as it can be.  More important, the colors are extremely natural (for a cartoon or for real life), rich and lush, with intense black levels.  Believe me, like its HD-DVD counterpart, the Blu-ray picture is a joy to watch, and my Video rating below reflects my reaction to the 2-D version only.

Audio:
If there is any improvement in the Blu-ray edition over the HD DVD, it is in the audio.  Where the HD DVD used Dolby Digital Plus 5.1, the Blu-ray uses Dolby TrueHD, a genuine lossless codec.  There is a tremendously deep, taut, room-shaking bass, combined with ultrawide dynamics for a sometimes awesome sonic experience.  Just wait until Santa's train thunders into your listening area.  The effect is enough to rattle the rafters.  The fact is, the disc's TrueHD sound is just as good as the video, with an impact so strong it'll blow your hair back.  What's more, the sound is clear and clean, with well-integrated dialogue and sonic effects.  It's an impressive soundtrack for an impressive audiovisual presentation.

Note:  By default, the disc also includes a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 track.  Remember to select TrueHD when you begin watching the film.

Extras:
As I found with the previous SD and HD editions, the extras are only so-so, again with no audio commentary.  I suppose Warners figure the main bonus items this time are the two movie formats, 2-D and 3-D, on the same disc, along with the four pairs of 3-D glasses.

The other extras begin with a four-minute segment, ""You Look Familiar: The Many Polar Faces of Tom Hanks,"" explaining why Hanks played so many roles in the film.  Then there's a five-minute bit, ""True Inspirations: An Author's Adventure,"" profiling the work of author and artist Chris Van Allsburg; followed by four minutes taking us ""Behind the Scenes of 'Believe'"" and into the recording studio.

After that, we find the main documentary, ""A Genuine Ticket to Ride,"" lasting about twenty-five minutes and covering the usual topics:  ""Performance Capture,"" ""Virtual Camera,"" ""Hair and Wardrobe,"" ""Creating the North Pole,"" and ""Music""; and a new ""Flurry of Effects"" gallery, about eight minutes of motion-capture sessions comparing the live-action preliminaries with the final animation; followed by four minutes of singer Josh Groban performing the song ""Believe"" at the Greek Theatre.

Finally, there are about two minutes of Christmas memories, ""Meet the Snow Angels,"" reminiscences from various of the filmmakers; plus a seven-minute, never-before-seen deleted musical scene with Smokey and Steamer, the train's engineers; and a ""THQ"" PC game demo with two playable levels.  The disc also has twenty-four scene selections; English, French, Spanish, and Dutch spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Dutch subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

A final added incentive:  The keep case comes housed in a colorful slipcover with a 3-D holographic picture on the cover.  Very attractive.

Parting Thoughts:
As a counterbalance to my curmudgeonly reactions, I would remind you that the Wife-O-Meter thinks very highly of this movie.  She feels the stop-and-go action is much like the way a child thinks, the colors, excitement, and adventure are right up a child's alley, the themes are moving, and the characters are fun.  She has persuaded me that children should love it as much as she does.  It undoubtedly is an enchanting movie for children, and it even began to grow on this cranky adult after the third or fourth viewing.

Now, indulge me a moment longer.  Strangely, perhaps, I saw many similarities in this film and, of all things, Steven Spielberg's ""1941.""  What's that, you say?  Yes, in the movie's episodic construction, its fitful, irregular execution, its musical interludes and march music, its Eddie Deezen character, and its elaborate special effects, it reminded me of Spielberg; which may be no coincidence given that Zemeckis worked extensively with Spielberg early in his career and was a wizard at special effects.  And like ""1941"" the sum of the many elements in ""The Polar Express"" don't quite add up to as much as they should.

Nonetheless,  as the Conductor says, ""One thing about trains:  It doesn't matter where they're going; what matters is deciding to get on.""  If you can believe strongly enough, you can do anything or be anything you want.  It's hard to knock so winsome and earnest a notion, and even though neither the Wife-O-Meter nor I liked the 3-D version very much, we positively loved the Blu-ray's 2-D picture and sound.

We have a TV with active 3D technology and I assumed it would be like all of the other 3D movies we own. It is not that type of 3D movie. It is the kind that comes with the blue and red paper 3D glasses. If you have a 3D home theater you know there is a significant quality difference. Needless to say, the kids were disappointed. If you want a 3D movie for an actual 3D home theater, this is not it. If you are just looking for a DVD that uses those paper 3D glasses you will be fine.",1431129600,4,567,3.8135593220338984

2338734,4,B0009XRZ9M,This is the real nightmare before Christmas. The animated characters seem more living dead-like than life like. The conductor is creepy in so many ways and condescending to boot. The action sequences are likely to scar young children for life. And the Santa rally at the end is very Leni Riefenstahl. All of the elements add up to a very well orchestrated and effective bi-polar experience. You don't believe me? You doubter!!,1430784000,,426,4.930555555555555

2338812,4,B0009XRZ9M,"If you are used to the kind of 3D experience you see in IMAX or regular movie theaters, this DVD is not up to that level. This uses anaglyphic 3D, which uses glasses with blue and red lenses (not polarized or active shutter technology). If you want the Polar Express disk that works with your high end 3D projector or TV, that would be a specific, high-end type of 3D blu-ray disk, which costs two or three times the cost of the DVD or 2D blu-ray disks of this same film. This review is for the DVD 3D version of the film.

This DVD is for those who want a 3D version of Polar Express without paying hundreds of dollars for all that high-end 3D equipment. It isn't as good as the more expensive 3D blu-ray and the system that goes with that, but it is a lot cheaper, because this DVD and the cheap colored glasses that go with it, will work on a regular 2D TV, computer monitor, or 2D projector.

It is also pretty inexpensive to buy lots of those cheap, cardboard blue-red glasses for showing this film in 3D to large groups, which is why I bought it.

As for the film itself. It has become kind of a Christmas classic. Personally, I can take it or leave it. My Christmas favorites are ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Love Actually.""",1428278400,,1252,4.274261603375527

2338815,5,B0009XRZ9M,"My favorite Christmas movie. I know, the animation of the character's faces wasn't incredible, but the human animation never seemed creepy to me, just a little rough and I can look past that. There are some parts of the movie that I can see classified as creepy though, although these same scenes are very magical and heartwarming at the same time - trudging through the empyty 1950's style Christmas city, the hobo, the lost toys car, etc.

The only part I really loathed was the short scene with the Steven Tyler elf and the Aerosmith Christmas song. This had nothing to do with the 1950's them or any other theme in the movie and I have absolutely no idea why this was in there.

This message is not to encourage lies, it is about encouraging faith and have faith no matter what background you came from. The message is also not about giving gifts, the gift at the end is just symbolism for the spirit of Christmas.",1428019200,,918,4.491017964071856

The cast of characters -- mostly children with Tom Hanks as the leading adult character -- could not be improved upon.  The music and action and animation were outstanding.

The other two, Titanic and Avatar were great, and could be used with our regular 3D glasses.  Not good at all.  Now as I see the 3 films together, the difference is the two say Blu-Ray 3D, and Polar Express is only 3D  I am going to assume I should not order any more that do not say BluRay on them.",1422489600,,397,3.9746835443037973

2339233,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I know it's probably difficult to make a feature length movie out of a short children's book. And I understand that in that situation the director needs to fill an hour and a half with content so there will be filler. It just seems that all of the filler in this movie is the plot finding ways to put children in peril. While the obvious filler made me pretty bored, the constant children in peril scared my children. Also, the cold dead eyes of all the characters from the motion capture animation don't help either. The kids enjoyed some of the movie and like to sing the Hot Chocolate song. The final scenes are very nice and heartwarming as well.",1422489600,2,650,4.425

Based on a lovely book, this movie adds in a few additional details to make it feature-length, but they're all great.  It has become a tradition in my first grade class to read the story, work on activities surrounding the story, and culminate our semester with Polar Express Day, where children ""board the train"" to watch the movie while sipping hot chocolate and eating cinnamon toast.  What a wonderful last day before we take a break for the holidays!  This year, I purchased an additional copy for a coworker as a gift.

2339386,5,B0009XRZ9M,I have always appreciated the writings Chris Van Allsburg.  His Polar Express is an especially beautifully told and illustrated tale.  The movie based on that book by Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant enhancement of the original story.  It has a magic in it that has captured children all the world over.  And that is especially true of our four year old grandson.,1420416000,,361,4.774193548387097

2339388,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is a nice holiday movie about the magic of Christmas and the importance of believing even when the logical side of your mind tells you not to. The movie expands on the simple (but lovely) story by Chris Van Allsburg about the journey to the Notrth Pole undertaken by a boy who is no longer sure that he believes in Santa Claus. I enjoyed watching with my children (ages 13 and 8).  We have a very small TV, but I'm guessing it would be even more fun with a large screen, as some of the train sequences are like a roller coaster ride. Having never stopped believing myself,  I highly recommend it!",1420416000,,601,4.3097345132743365

2339777,1,B0009XRZ9M,This review is for the blu-ray disc- not the movie. This is utter garbage 1st generation 3D tech which requires paper glasses with one red and one blue lens.

2339781,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Great children's movie that focuses on the magic of Christmas.  There are no religious references, so if that is important to you, then this may not be your movie.  However, if you want a feel-good movie that is magical and beautiful, this is your film.  There are intense moments, which would scare my children a little bit when they were younger.  Now that they are older and on the cusp of ""not believing,"" I hope it allows them to believe in that magic for a lifetime...because it is always there.",1418947200,,501,4.533333333333333

I've been reading the story to kids for many years and this year I even became an Elf on our local Polar Express.  Believing in the magic of Christmas is something some people tend to lose as they get older.  The story, and movie, just goes to show that doesn't have to happen.  So, when you ring the bell see if you can still hear it's sweet sound because it does ring for those who truly believe.",1418947200,,492,4.136842105263158

2339791,3,B0009XRZ9M,"The overall idea of the film is terrific. However, the characters, to me, lacked spirit and passion.  Somewhat robotic and zombiish, kind of like being on an overdose of ritalin they failed to make the magical trip to the northpole believable and thus failed to promote the believe in Santa and the magical spirit of Christmas. The train and its totally superficial journey was more believable than the characters!  Although a worthwhile spectacle to see, it is not a movie which I can't wait to see again such as ""A Christmas Story"" or ""Christmas Vacation"".",1418860800,2,558,4.863157894736842

2339842,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I've never cared much for 3D. I usually think it's distracting and gimmicky. But I bought an AMAZING Samsung F8500 plasma several months ago, and it came with 6 pairs of glasses, so I wanted to at least try it at some point. I just wasn't going to go out of my way to do so. I don't even buy movies very often anymore, but this 3D blu-ray was pretty reasonable, and even though my kids are getting a little older, the Polar Express is still enjoyable to watch once a year. I figured why not.

We watched it this past weekend, and everybody really enjoyed it. If you like this movie, I highly recommend this version. The 3D isn't an afterthoughtit's clear that much of the movie was made with 3D in mindand it's well done. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the 3D element. It added a depth and a richness that was a big improvement over the standard HD version (or at least that was my conclusion after re-watching the 2D version of a couple of scenes).

Does that mean I'm now a 3D convert and that I'm going to go out and start seeking out 3D content? No, but I am a fan of it for this movie, and I am more inclined to give 3D a chance in the future. The Catch 22 for 3D is that there really aren't any rentable or streamable titles, and buying the 3D version usually comes at a much higher price...making it a no go. But when this feature is included for a reasonable price as it is here, it's another story.

Even if you don't care about 3D, the other reason to get this disc is for the fantastic high resolution audio. The dynamic music, the train noises, etc are really something special when played on good surround system. Turn it way up!",1418774400,,1662,4.220125786163522

2339893,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express is an excellent animated film based on the book of the same name. This film however, goes far beyond the idea of the book.  The original book is an excellently animated scroll with an easy to follow story for smaller children.  It ends with the protagonist getting a bell from Santa.  The bell can ring, but it's tone is only heard by children who believe in Santa.

This movie is a bit like a dream.  The characters are never named, one must look at the credits to see Hero Boy and Hero Girl, etc.  The Polar Express pulls in to the front of Hero Boy's house and the conductor, excellently played by Tom Hanks convinces the boy to get on.  Again, there is a sort of magical dream-like quality to this, the boy goes into the snow of a dark Mid-Western winter night in only a bathrobe and PJ's and he doesn't freeze.  This is a leap of faith, for we know that Hero Boy is very much a doubter.  He has come to seriously question his belief in Santa Claus and is on the verge of cynicism.

Because of the unreliableness of dream vs. reality,the entire trip has a sort of exaggerated strangeness to it.  The conductor and another child cross railway cars easily and yet when our protagonist attempts to follow, the passageway between cars has changed to an impassible, outside connection with the couplings exposed. In another surreal sequence, the Hero walks above the railway cars, calf-deep in snow where he meets a ghost hobo.  Like in a dream, time itself passes in an illogical way, five minutes to Midnight take much longer than they should.  The Polar Express continues on, true to the book, going over mountains and valleys, nearly touching the moon, and finally arriving at the North Pole.  One never really knows if this is all a dream, or something like a prophecy which occurrs during sleep.  It all adds to the mystery of the film.  Indeed the Hero wakes in his accurately represented, Mid-Western home seemingly refreshed.

The North Pole, and Santa's Workshop have an Edwardian feel to them.  It turns out that the producers made the town look like the Pullman workshop at the turn of the century.  Indeed there is something quite comforting about the two decades before the Great War.  Walt Disney made an entire series of films about Edwardian times-there is a sort of nostalgia.  What's the quote, ""Nobody born after 1914 really knows what it's like to be happy.""  Santa's workshop is an excellent example of this nostalgic, child-like wonder at a well run society where progress is the norm and there is prosperity for all.

Additionally, the movie uses an excellent series of dilemmas to make the story interesting, the train goes off the track, the small boy trips trying to get on the train, a ticket gets lost, caribou block the tracks, there are elf skydivers who help the lighter-than-air craft land the packages on the sleigh.  The gadgets and things in the North Pole are all excellent and creative.  The train-ride is like a roller coaster ride.  Some of the scenes are so intense small children might become, temporarily, frightened.

The use of bells as a device to show faith is pretty excellent too.  There is something wholly theological about Santa himself.  Many people view the jolly old elf as a sort of secular, anti-Jesus (I don't wish to say anti-Christ) who clouds the ""true meaning of Christmas.""  Perhaps, but Santa is very likely the modern expression of the god Woden and Christmas a continuing celebration of the birth of Mithras and the festival of Saturnalia.  Perhaps the meaning of the movie is to believe...in the mythological truths that spring from the deepest of roots.",1418601600,,3638,4.699842022116903

I ordered the blue-ray version believing it was 3D but when I put it in my player, it wasn't. Confusing because even though the picture did NOT show 3D, the reviews talked about how great the 3D effects are. I thought I ordered the right thing and come to find out I needed to reorder so I could have the 3D effects.",1418083200,,460,4.010869565217392

My 3-year-old was able to watch this movie to his little heart's content in July, but now that it's the season he can't watch it anymore :( Please, Amazon, please make this movie available to Prime members again!!!

As for the movie itself, it's pretty okay. My 3-year-old boy loves it. We can generally tolerate it, which I'd say is worth at least 3 stars. The motion capture animation is always a little creepy-looking, but especially so when they are animating children. It just doesn't look right most of the time. The storyline is cute, and it definitely makes you want to believe in Santa again or at least the magic of Christmas.",1417824000,,741,4.613636363636363

The animation has passed into the ""so real it's creepy"" territory. But mostly this movie is so bad because of the annoying characters and all the useless narrative add-ons.",1417046400,2,339,4.964912280701754
2340222,5,B0009XRZ9M,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. This timeless and classic tale takes struggles from all walks of life and animates them on a journey to the North Pole. It teaches how to depend on others, how to be a part of a family where none of us have it all, but all of us add something important, where what we can trust in is love and acceptance. And we see how this is made possible if we come to believe. We are shown that the journey is more important than the goal.

Morals lie deep beneath the animated surface. The hero shows us doubt - for him, doubt in Santa, for us, doubt in anything that requires faith where all the facts don't support what we've been told. He has the fantastic opportunity to go into a world where the truth is shown to him, the importance here being that since most of us don't get this chance, we can learn from his experience.

He meets a girl who is loving and welcoming and befriends the boy throughout his journey. She is caring and stays by him through thick and thin. She is assertive and proactive, she is outgoing and is willing to reach out fearlessly, to touch and hug another human being in need, likely the result of a loving and supportive family or spiritual life. She has received, and therefore can give and keep giving. She is given the title of one who can be a leader because these are the traits that people will follow.

He next meets a young boy who seems to know it all. More than likely, he has been taught to believe his is ignorant and therefore tries to prove the opposite by learning random facts and showing his accomplishments. He is screaming for acceptance and respect, and doesn't realize it. At the end, his lesson is to learn, but not to learn in order to prove intelligence, rather to learn that he is already intelligent and thereby improve his true self esteem.

And then we meet the lonely little boy who is filled with fear and lonliness. From a family he cannot rely on, his attitude extends to all people and he will not interact with others as they might reject or humiliate him. Christmas, or love, has never ""worked out"" for him. But on the journey he is set with others who are dependable and surround him with love. In the end, he learns that there are people you can count on and he experiences their love and acceptance. He learns to believe in others.

We are basically shown that we need each other, that we don't all have the same strengths and together we are much stronger than apart. We don't have all we need to live alone, and we will always fall into times of need. It is our bonds with others that gives us what we lack and makes us more whole and complete. As the journey ends, the conductor, the one who brings the group together and keeps them together until their lessons are learned, says, ""One thing about trains (aka where people gather) it doesn't matter where they are going (aka you don't know what's ahead), what matters is deciding to get on (aka being a meaningful part of a supportive group). Give when you can, take when you need. Believe that others will be there for you, and they will be, if you believe you are there for them. This story does a great job of showing that.",1417046400,,3178,4.334453781512605

2340262,2,B0009XRZ9M,"Transparently forced Christmas ""magic"" that can't even lean on its CG visuals for support. Despite the wide variety of gaudy, jolly ghosts, elves and Christmas nicknacks flittering about the screen, this movie has no spirit, no zeal, no life. It sure goes through the motions, producing overly-familiar shapes, sounds and colors by the shovelful, but that never translates to more real emotion than the pajama section of a Sears catalog. It's mostly a one-man show, with Tom Hanks providing voices for a good ninety percent of the cast, but he's unable to work any holiday miracles with such flat source material. The wealth of bad, empty computer graphics do the film no favors, either, somehow managing to bridge the gap between hollow marionettes and the unnerving denizens of the uncanny valley. A desperate effort to join the endless parade of holiday classics, it's a noble-minded (but incompetent) talent flush.",1416528000,,918,5.167785234899329
2340263,3,B0009XRZ9M,The dvd stopped several times for whatever reason......Very disappointed that the movie didn't run smoothly but rather stopped a number of times as if it was not a new movie. :( not even worth the time to make a trip to the post office to send it back with a tracking number.,1416441600,,275,4.3076923076923075

2340272,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Sorry, but this movie is CREEPY.  We bought for our kids (3 and 5) as we are taking them on the Polar Express train ride and wanted them to learn the story.  The eyes of the cartoon characters are this odd glassy color, and EVERY adult in this movie (almost including Santa) are loud talking, somewhat menacing, and almost scary.  I literally had to explain to the kids that these scary train workers will not be working on our train ride. It is very suspenseful and the kids are definitely entranced by it but freaked out at the same time.",1416355200,2,540,4.38

2340281,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Like love and marriage, Christmas and trains go together, or did so for my post-WWII generation. The Polar Express conjures up a number of familiar images to me: trains, snowy nights, and red-brick cities. The year I moved to Akron, Ohio, Chris Van Allsburg's book was published. It was Christmastime and red-brick Akron was blanketed in snow, and a rail-line ran through the center of the city. I half-expected to see a steam locomotive pull up at any moment. I didn't buy the book, but I did see the movie in the theater, and bought the DVD when it came out. While a bit short on story, what ""The Polar Express"" does well is capture a child's wonder of Christmas.",1416355200,,665,4.55

I simply do not understand the draw of this movie and my kids weren't impressed either. I think other negative reviewers summed it up perfectly when they called it ""creepy"" and I personally believe this movie did a huge diservice to the book. In it, The North Pole is some weird, dark place where a broken record voice from hell sings, Santa Clause is Coming to Town. Seriously folks, this is some nightmarish kind of stuff and not feel good Christmasy at all. I give this movie two stars only because of the runaway train scene.",1409443200,4,624,4.580357142857143

2340509,5,B0009XRZ9M,"When I first saw this movie, I didn't like it. I wasn't crazy about the animation. I watched it again later on and really looked at it, especially paying attention to the animation this time. I realized how amazing it was, so lifelike. I own it in 3D which is the only way to truly appreciate it. I absolutely love this movie!
It's a story about growing up, but not growing old. The boy knows there's no Santa. He even checks out the encyclopedia on the North Pole which tells him there's no life on it. But the train comes and he doesn't know what to make of it. He decides to get on after Hank's character explains what's going on. He sees all the other children and how excited they are about going to see Santa. The train ride is wildly exciting . I don't want to give out spoiler alerts here. Of course they reach the North Pole and there are thousands of elves running about. The children get off the train to join them. Everyone's waiting for Santa Claus to appear. He's going to choose one of the kids to receive the first gift of the season. Unfortunately one of the kids doesn't want to join because ""Christmas doesn't work out for me"". The main boy who's made friends with a girl talk him into going with them to join the rest of the group. As they're about to get off the train, it starts to move and takes them on a crazy ride through town. They discover how the good & bad lists are created and how the presents get into Santa's bag. Eventually they make their way back to the big event where Santa finally shows up. This is a big moment for the boy who didn't believe. Santa picks a child (no spoiler alert here) and then the party begins. Santa leaves for the ride around the world. The children, having had the time of their lives, board the train back home very tired. The present that the child picked gets lost. This gift had so much meaning to the child and he/she is terribly upset because there's a hole in the pocket of the robe where it fell out of. The next morning, gifts are waiting and the true meaning of believing comes to light.
This is a wonderful movie for the entire family. The music is fun. Tom Hanks is totally enjoyable. The picture is mesmerizing, especially in 3D.  I think just about everyone will enjoy this holiday favorite.",1409097600,,2268,4.311475409836065

2340524,5,B0009XRZ9M,"IMHO, this is one fantastic movie. It brings back fond memories (for many) of the Holiday Season from years ago. Understand however that this is about the Santa Clause version of Christmas with almost no religious content whatsoever. Some took umbrage at this fact but if you can overlook that, I expect you will love this movie. Tom Hanks does his usual excellent work voicing several of the characters and the highly accurate depiction of the mechanics of the train will delight, should you be a rail buff. The overall artwork is great altho some have complained that the characters look a little too real and that seemed to make them a bit uneasy. Not me. The message is pure and simple: ya gotta believe in Santa or none of the ""magic"" will happen. Keep close watch at the very end to catch the last bit of that magic.

The book is fairly short, so they had to add a ton more content to fill the time of this movie. And I think they did it marvelously. Tom Hanks shines in his multiple voice acting roles. This movie has a very classic feel to it, but with modern animation and audio. Everything comes together for this movie. Literally nothing feels slacking.
The story itself is about a young boy who is starting to not believe in Santa any more. He is awoken late at night on Christmas Eve by the sound and feel of a train. He runs out front to see the spectacular Polar Express. He gets on, and so begins the adventure up to the North Pole.
This movie is an absolute must for any family who loves Christmas movies!",1406419200,,852,4.364779874213837

2340650,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I find some parts of the plot a bit difficult to digest because I am not a kid and I think like a parent now. My imagination left me when I was about 10 years old or younger and I have yet to get it back. This hurts when trying to watch a movie such as this.

It is a clean movie. There is nothing that makes your inner alarm go off and block it from the kids.

If you are a strict legalistic Christian, the Santa Claus basis will likely not be your cup of tea.

Most secularists and even Christians from blue states will call be a radical right wing evil conservative Christian and I do not have a problem keeping it in my on-line video collection.",1405209600,,649,4.015503875968992

2340654,5,B0009XRZ9M,Best Christmas movie by far of any time period. I love the train and the effects and the believe theme. loved the elves as well and Tom Hanks was brilliant as all characters. Wonderful for kids and adults alike. I watch this all year! Not just on christmas.,1405036800,,257,4.375
2340655,1,B0009XRZ9M,"I pretty much never watch a movie on Amazon without first reading the reviews, and in seeing all of the 5 star reviews, I was thinking this was going to be Toy Story in Christmas land.  Well, I ran into some big problems with it as soon as the ""hot chocolate"" section of the film hit.  It was my first hint there would be a lot of songs and weird animation, none of it with any meaning whatsoever. I can't help but find myself left wondering what in the world these other people were watching.  It seems like 2/3rds of the animation is about things flying just out of the reach of people (the ticket, the pin, the ticket, the pin... Oh my word, repetitive nothingness much?).  I realize lots of people are calling this a Christmas classic, but I really have to wonder, did these people watch any of the old claymation Christmas Specials? Because, in THOSE films, things happened.  There were actions, and consequences to those actions. Not so much in this one.

The film seemed so meaningless that when I saw the train tracks going on 'the steepest slope ever"" I thought to myself ""OHHHHHHHH..... so Disney wants to build a ride called the Polar Express, and base it on the movie.""  I don't know if they did build a ride, but the movie went from pointless sub plot to pointless sub-plot.  I hate that I hated it.  I so wanted to like it.  It's just, well, nothing happened.  There were no consequences behind any of the actions, and Tom Hanks obviously tried his heart out, but to me, it was sooooo obvious it was Tom Hanks, whenever I saw the conductor, I saw Tom Hanks, and not a character, and that's a death knell for ANY film, but is DOUBLY bad when it's an animated film.

Still, other people loved it to which I can only say, ""I don't know why.""  I feel like I might be the only person who didn't get whatever it was they were going for, and I'm giving it one star NOT because of the bad 3-D (I watched it for free in Hi-Def on Amazon Prime in 2D), but rather because it was just bad.",1405036800,,1991,4.277333333333333

2340673,2,B0009XRZ9M,"This strayed too far from the book. The CGI characters were very unnatural looking and rather disturbing.

2340676,4,B0009XRZ9M,"This is a 3D showcase with excellent sound and 3D that's good but not as good as it appeared in the Imax theater where I first saw the movie.

The sound comes into play most effectively when the train arrives.  With a good home theater, that train will shake the house.  It's a good effect early in the movie.

Disappointing was the 3D itself.  The depth was fine but the 3D was  -- on the blu-ray, not the theater -- reluctant to break much past the plane of the TV's surface.

Tom Hanks plays several of the roles -- an idea that turns out to have been better on paper than it turned out to be.  The story and some of his performances were . . . well, more creepy than endearing.

Story -- 3 Stars
Sound - 5 Stars
Performances - 3 Stars
3D effects -- 4 Stars.
Young child's likely reaction -- restlessness.

The movie does have its excellent moments -- the arrival of the train, the tracking of a wayward train ticket as it brings you on a pretty good roller coaster ride, the high-energy dance number as hot chocolate is served to the children, and a walk on the train's roof during a snow storm.

Yup it has its ups and downs -- for better and for worse.",1404691200,,1158,4.171171171171171
2340677,3,B0009XRZ9M,"As often as I try, I simply cannot understand the hype for this overrated, so-called classic. The book may have been a treat (I've not read it), the movie is a trick. Too much Hanks and too much repetition of action thinly disguised as something different. Calling it a Christmas classic is a disservice to both the word ""classic"" and the true meaning of Christmas. It is more an ode to toys, toys and more toys and mind numbing roller coaster rides called action.",1404604800,,464,4.535714285714286

2340701,2,B0009XRZ9M,"Our nephew loves this movie.  So, we thought our son - who loves trains - would enjoy this.  He watched it - but hasn't asked to see it again.  Others he has been asking for.

The worst part was how incredibly noisey it is.  We all ended up with headaches - and my husband and I have been to some very loud concerts and left without headaches!

The story is okay - but the animation is a little freak-deaky looking and doesn't get better as you watch (which we were hoping for).  In the end, we would say try it - because everyone takes their coffee different.  But don't be surprised if it's not a hit with your family.  Oh, and have some asprin ready :)",1403913600,,655,4.134920634920635

2340713,5,B0009XRZ9M,"For many of us, ""The Polar Express"" was probably the first book we ever managed to read on our own. The story is interesting, the perspective is inspired, and the subject matter is timeless.  While the movie does take some liberties with the book (there's a lot that happens in the movie that does not occur in the book), the story matter stays fairly true to its origins. The soundtrack is wonderful, the visuals are beautiful, and the memories of my childhood Christmases that it provoked are priceless. I would highly recommend this movie not only for children, but also for adults who are stressed out around the holidays and need to take a step back and remember when you too could hear the bell ring...",1403395200,,708,4.619047619047619

I cannot understand how 1,000+ reviewers don't see how this is a HORRIBLE children's film.  My husband purchased the Blue Ray 3-D DVD awhile back so I saw it again with my 9-year-old daughter recently.  Even she agreed it was a lousy and weird Christmas movie.  The settings are desolate.  There are many instances of peril.  (Peril in movies could be fun or have a purpose, there was no purpose for it here.)  There is an abandoned North Pole that the children are walking through.  Other than the conductor (Tom Hanks) who is mean to children, there is not one loving adult in sight.  The children are completely abandoned.  Wait, I forgot there is a creepy Hobo on the train who is actually a ghost. The Hot Chocolate song sung by Tom Hanks has to be one of the worst songs ever on film.  The animation is atrocious in this particular scene because the waiters looks like robots.  How is this a children's film?  The original book was beautiful, but there was a lot of artistic license taken and the results are simply depressing.  I'm throwing my copy in the trash.

After buying the DVD, and now the BlueRay, I find that the story itself is very sweet, and the entire atmosphere of the film makes a big impression on the viewer.  It's now one of my favorite Christmas films (the music is great, too).  I prefer Christmas movies that have more of a religious slant, but this one movie is an exception.",1389398400,,458,4.241379310344827

Some 3D movies should never have been made in 3D to start with-they will throw in a couple of effects to let you know you are watching a 3D movie. But this is truly amazing. The whole movie is just one amazing scene after another. Next to Jurassic Park and Titanic, probably the best.",1389398400,,374,4.208333333333333

I also enjoyed the special features and look behind the making of this movie as well as scenes that were cut out.  This movie is for everyone!

This movie was great. However, as a person of color, I wish that they had not shown Santa's face. It would have provided a lot more opportunity for children to imagine Santa in whatever color or image that they wanted.  If that had happened, I would have rated the movie 5 stars.  Hopefully in the future, there will be a movie that provides a more imaginative view of Santa.",1387929600,,380,4.4

Now all these years later,  I have kids, and I thought I'd give it another chance.  My oldest son thinks the movie is okay, but my younger (6 years old) was rolling all around bored stiff.

My second assessment is that the characters are not charming and some are down right creepy.  The train ride to get to the North Pole is dark and boring.  There is little visually appealing.  They could have done so much with this film and did not.  I never understood all the great reviews.  I don't think there's really a strong message either.

I don't think this is a classic in any sense and won't be watching it again.",1387843200,,711,4.2

The 3-D is amazing, your right there in the movie experience.  I found myself reaching out trying to catch the train ticket that got away.  And it snowed in my living room! And Tom Hanks.....that man is pure magic himself!  You simply believe.....the message comes across crystal clear.  And that's what the season is all about .

If it offers red and blue 3D glasses with the movie,avoid it at all cost. You will hate it as I and everyone else who tried this one did.
On the other hand,the version with the train going over the bridge,with the kid standing on top of the train on the cover,worked fine,so,be careful which one you order. I give that one five stars! so,if you order one,be sure to order this one,not the other one.",1387497600,,559,4.490196078431373

There was a red and green shadow when we attempted to watch it on our LG 3-D television with the LG 3-D glasses.  We even tried to use the 3-D glasses that came with the movie, but no success.  I'll have to investigate why this happened since no other 3-D movie we have purchased has given us this problem.  So be warned.  Check if there is a particular type of 3-D viewing required.

We watched it several times, when it first came out, and last weekend we enjoyed it once again. Every Christmas holiday season, we view several Christmas movies. This one has become a favorite.

The story is heart-warming and inspiring, about a young boy, who didn't believe in Santa. He could never hear the Christmas bells ring, when he didn't believe. But, at the end, he heard the joyous sound of Christmas bells, and his parents didn't.

Many contemporary writers of children's story's resort to cuteness and cheap emotive melodrama to make their stories interesting. Not so with the author of The Polar Express. The plot is one that does not stretch my imagination to the breaking point for believability. I think this is one of the best screen adaptations of a children's book to come along in many a year. This is the reason I bought the book and the movie for my 5 year old grandson.,1386979200,,605,4.269565217391304

2341136,5,B0009XRZ9M,Polar express is one of the most heartwarming shows I've ever sat down for. I could watch it repeatedly. The expressions of the children the actions of the conductor. The way the entire movie is played out. I will say thumbs up! A must see.,1386892800,,240,4.355555555555555

2341138,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express (2004) is, in my opinion, one of the better Christmas movies, and in time, will be considered a classic. Why? Well, this movie is somewhat off the beaten path of Christmas movies, in that it highlights the far north in a sort of lonely, dark tone and against the elements. The prevailing message of the story is to 'believe', which is an all-encompassing lesson in life, actually, rather than just believing in Santa Claus. The animation and scenery are absolutely breathtaking, and one can't help but feel that the whole journey to the North Pole is real. It feels as if the viewer is on the train (or on top of a car, in the eerie hobo scene). I love this film because it is Christmas in a darker tone, but retains its identity of joy and giving. This movie will hit the spot at this time of year, especially for those who haven't seen it yet.",1386806400,,863,4.4

2341199,2,B0009XRZ9M,"What a wierd, lifeless, uncomfortable and depressing movie this is.  The whole thing has a feeling of menace that seems to be always lurking just beneath the surface.  Tom Hanks annoyingly provides the voice for many of the film's characters.  I do like Tom as an actor, but he's just totally wrong for this movie entirely.  The Conductor - annoying, over the top and kind of creepy.  The little know-it-all kid with glasses - also extremely annoying.  This is that ""special""  kind of character that - if this were any other movie - you know would get his comeuppance before the credits rolled (instead he just gets a little ""talking to"" from Santa).  And speaking of Santa - I'll just put it this way, I woudn't want MY kids sitting in this Santa's lap.  The pitch effect used to lower Hanks' voice is just too surreal for words.  The Hobo - annoying and kind of dark, but I guess he's supposed to be so we'll let him off the hook.  And those menacing elves, you just can't tell if they're going to give you a big christmas hug or jump up and eat your face off.  All the scenes in the deserted areas of the north pole with the distant echo-y sounding Christmas music that plays in the background... It's like something out of a horror movie and it's utterly dark and depressing.  And who in their right mind would have put those two mentally challenged ""engineers"" in charge of operating this train??  Laws of physics?  Suspension of disbelief? Forget about them completely.  The reality train pulled out of the station sometime after last new years.  You've heard the saying ""check your brain at the door""?  Well forget that too.  You need to go ahead and send your brain on vacation a good 2 weeks before you even try and watch this thing.",1386028800,14,1742,4.507987220447284

2341305,3,B0009XRZ9M,Movie appears to be new in package but case has been cut and has a deep slit on the back side. It arrived quickly and the price was right so I guess the flawed case will have to do.,1379894400,,181,3.6666666666666665
2341306,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is a must see....
The technology behind this is outstanding
this will become a yearly must watch movie at Christmas",1379894400,,120,4.761904761904762
2341307,3,B0009XRZ9M,"When I first saw this in 3D in the theater, I was enthralled.  Viewing it now I realize how far 3D technology has come.  The story line is still great however",1379721600,,158,4.064516129032258
2341308,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I usually buy ""Prime"" only.  But I took a chance on this DVD because of the price.  The DVD arrived a lot sooner than promised and was ""like new"" just like it was advertised.",1379548800,,174,4.088235294117647
2341309,5,B0009XRZ9M,Excellent 3D compared to the one with the paper red and blue glasses that was sent to me on my first order.  I sent it back and Amazon gave me a refund.  The new one was designed for the new 3D TVs and to be used with the glasses supplied by the manufacturer.  I never was able to view the original Polar Express all the way through because the 3D was so bad it almost caused nausea.  The. new version is absolutely great!!!  Be careful when ordering this DVD that it is the correct version for your TV.  Make sure the picture of the product says Blu ray 3D before ordering.  The picture shown on this review is not the new 3D version.,1379462400,,635,4.1138211382113825

2341314,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Even though this is a cartoon based story for kids, my wife and I,  loved it, enjoyed it, cherished it, and watched it,twice.
It's so lovely, the graphics are exemplary, vivid, extremely colourful, with high resolution HD (1080P) 3D format and the audio quality is astounding. (My home theater comprises of Yamaha DSP-A1  7.1 system for Audio and Video system is Samsung Smart TV 7000, 3D capable and Samsung BlueRay player BD-P1600)
I would recommend Polar Express, to any one who posses 3D capable Video system with a good quality Audio system.
Others, who do not have a 3D capable Video system, Polar Express in 3D will not work satisfactorily.
Thank you Tom thank you AMAZON.

2341315,5,B0009XRZ9M,This is a gift for someone who religiously watches Polar Express every Christmas. We thought the 3D version would be a big hit. We are giving it to him on Sept 10th.,1378598400,,165,4.1875

2341322,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Watch this one every Christmas season  It is a wonderful family movie. Yes, as a few others have said - not much of a plot.  But, did it really need a deep story line?

2341323,5,B0009XRZ9M,"If you really want to have your whole family together one night, this is the movie, it is a beautiful Christmas story for all ages, the only issue is the glasses quite irritable for the anaglyph 3-D, but you have the option to watched it in 2D, bottom line, an oustanding production.",1377734400,,283,4.461538461538462
2341324,5,B0009XRZ9M,For some reason the DVD did not play in any of my machines. I contacted the seller and he/she was very understanding. My account was credited immediately and I did not have to go to the expense of mailing it back. It was GREAT to have someone take my word and get a NO hassle return. Thanks!!!,1377475200,,293,4.157894736842105
2341325,2,B0009XRZ9M,Red and blue 3D glasses were not expected and the picture did not have a clear 3D look. The picture was blurry. My six year olds did not like the movie within seconds of putting on the glasses and refused to watch the movie.,1377475200,,224,4.113636363636363
2341326,5,B0009XRZ9M,Excellent quality!  The 3D is amazing.  It will snow in your living room.  The train comes right out of the screen.  The sound is crystal clear.  Worth every penny. Honest.,1377388800,,172,4.6
2341327,1,B0009XRZ9M,This is does not work on the newer technology 3D TV's and 3D players. It's the old red and blue screen with the glasses included with the package. I would not buy this unless you like watching old style 3D movies with red and blue glasses. I was seriously disappointed.,1377043200,2,269,4.4

christmas present to my grandchildren.",1376611200,,159,4.3
2341330,5,B0009XRZ9M,My husband and I enjoyed this movie during the Christmas Holiday. I was not sure what to expect. I never heard of the movie before I ordered it. I am glad that I gave this movie a chance. It had a great story line. It was a modernized animation movie. Again enjoyable.,1376524800,,268,4.173076923076923
2341331,4,B0009XRZ9M,"First off let me say that my son is obsessed with trains and this is absolutely his favorite movie, ever. He asks to watch this movie every single day. We have bought 3 times already because my son keeps trying to put it in the DVD player himself and scratches it. Needless to say that I am so sick of this movie and I don't love the story at all. The elves are super creepy with weird voices and the guardian angel comes across as the ""bad guy"" in my sons mind. Then one of the little boys  sings a song saying ""I guess that Santa's busy cause he never comes to town.."" basically implying that he doesn't get presents because he is poor. How are you going to make a movie telling kids that Santa is real, but poor kids don't get presents? That is my number one issue with this movie. However, I will give it 4 stars only because my son loves it so I guess it doesn't matter too much how I feel about it.",1376352000,,904,4.050279329608938

2341334,4,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie is really good for the price, however, I thought it was going to be the actual 3-D movie and not require red and blue glasses.  I have a 3-D TV but they are the glasses that look like sun glasses and I thought that's what kind of a movie it was, however, it turned out to be the red and blue glasses, which did come with the movie, by the way...",1376092800,,356,3.8767123287671232

2341358,1,B0009XRZ9M,"The most important fact about this is that it's not the kind of 3-D you think it is.  It's the old school type with red and blue glasses.  Which don't work very well.  I'm unsure if you'd even need a 3-D player for it.  I didn't like the movie either, the characters were all very disturbing to me in appearance and it feels like they used a very old animation style that was really antiquated even before this film was put together.  The story is happy, but I honestly found the 'don't think, just believe' to be a bit heavy handed and a poor message overall for adults with half a brain or children of average intelligence or better.  If you're looking for a legit 3-D movie, this isn't really a 3-D movie, and the movie itself is a 3 star film on a good day.  Buyer beware.",1373500800,6,776,4.202702702702703

2341368,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is one of my favorite films for Christmas. I have the original version on DVD but watching this film on 3D makes a big difference. I understand what other reviewers are saying about the quality of the 3D version, but to be honest, this is as good as it gets for regular DVD; unless you buy the Blu-Ray version in 3D, but you would also need the television to go with it and a 3D Blu-Ray player.

If this is you favorite film, then don't hesitate to purchase the 3D version. It really isn't that bad as other reviewers said. It's still a great movie and fun to watch in 3D.",1371254400,,577,4.151785714285714

2341409,2,B0009XRZ9M,"As a child I grew up reading Chris Van Allsburg's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express/dp/0395389496/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express</a>, about a young boy who climbs aboard a mysterious train late one Christmas Eve and takes a trip to the North Pole, where one lucky child will be selected to receive the first gift of Christmas.  The illustrations held a dreamy, mystical feel to them, and the story was simple and spare but still struck a chord with millions of children and adults around the world, including myself.  And to this day I consider it a holiday classic, right up there with ""The Night Before Christmas"" and ""Gift of the Magi.""

When the movie version of said book was announced, I was skeptical to say the least.  Movies based on books often pale in comparison to their source material, in my opinion, and movies based on children's books have an even higher chance of failing, given that they often have to stretch and pad the source material to make anything approaching a feature-length film.  I decided to give the film a chance, however, not wanting to dismiss it simply for being an adaptation of a beloved tale.

Sadly, the film indeed fell flat on multiple fronts.  Even ignoring the fact that it's an adaptation, it's still a fairly bad movie -- maybe not ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" bad, but still not the classic I love.

""The Polar Express"" follows a young boy (never named, just like in the source material) who is skeptical about Santa's existence, but nonetheless still climbs aboard the titular train when it stops at his house on Christmas Eve.  He interacts with the other children aboard said train -- most notably a girl who flip-flops between being bold and timid as the plot requires, a timid boy from a poor family who has his own doubts about Christmas, and an annoying know-it-all nerdy boy -- as well as with the over-the-top conductor and a grouchy train-hopping hobo who may or may not be real.  Various mishaps, some instigated by the boy himself, threaten to keep the Polar Express from reaching the North Pole in time for Santa's departure, however... and the boy's skepticism may prove to be the biggest obstacle of all.

For me, this movie fails to captivate me for several reasons.  The biggest reason is the visuals -- while they're technically impressive and there are some beautiful scenery shots, the entire movie just looks lifeless.  This is most evident in the human characters, who were filmed with motion-capture technology in an attempt to look more realistic but end up looking like animated mannequins or even corpses.  Human characters in Pixar films and in later DreamWorks films still manage to look lively and exhibit personality despite being pixels on screens, but the characters in ""Polar Express"" fall straight into the Uncanny Valley -- they look ALMOST real, but not quite, and it's that ""not quite"" quality that ends up making them creepy.  The rest of the film doesn't look much better, though -- the North Pole is one of the most boring and grim-looking versions of Santa's headquarters that I've ever seen, the elves look like they belong in a Lord of the Rings film instead of a holiday children's flick, and Santa... well, the animators made the weird choice of giving him a glowing aura, which makes him look more radioactive than enchanting.

The writing isn't much better.  Again, weird choices were made here -- instead of fleshing the story out by giving the characters actual backstories, it decides to pad its length with frantic action sequences, weird detours, and pointless side plots.  The main character never even gets a name, and the decision to make him a skeptic (when the original book clearly made him a believer in Santa) strikes me as odd.  None of the other characters are very likable -- they're bland at best (the girl, the poor boy, Santa himself) and downright annoying at worst (the nerdy kid, the conductor, the hobo).  The dialogue is awkward as well, with no one's lines sounding at all natural and the voice actors mostly sounding like they're reading straight from the script.  Tom Hanks voices no fewer than four characters in this film (the conductor, the hobo, the boy's dad, and Santa himself), but despite the fact that he's usually a wonderful actor and has done great voiceover work before (the ""Toy Story"" films), here he simply chews scenery and delivers his lines in as over-the-top fashion as possible.

Overall, this film just feels forced -- like they were deliberately trying to make a holiday classic and filled in all the blanks of the ""formula.""  They threw together all the prerequisite elements, but put no effort into actually making said elements work.  The songs are forgettable and have some rather cringe-worthy lyrics, the dance numbers are forced, and lines and speeches geared toward evoking Christmas spirit and charm just fall flat.  I think the filmmakers failed to realize that you can't just slap together ""required"" elements and have an instant classic -- only time, and putting true heart and effort into a film, will make it a classic.

I do hear this film is better if seen in 3D, and I can see where that comes from -- there are plenty of obvious ""3D"" shots in this film, and I can see where said parts would be better viewed in that fashion.  But 3D feels like an unnecessary gimmick to me, and a film should work on its own merits, not just because of the 3D.  (That and some of the 3D parts, such as the runaway train sequences, make me wonder if the film wasn't designed with a roller coaster in mind, as if the filmmakers were hoping Universal Studios would take notice...)

I highly recommend the original book in place of this movie -- even though it's a mere ten-minute read, it's well worth your time.  And if you want an enjoyable Christmas film, I'd suggest ""A Christmas Story,"" ""The Santa Clause"" (first movie only), the 2D animated ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" special, ""Home Alone,"" or even ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" in place of this.",1366588800,7,6082,4.86531007751938

2341411,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I purchased the 3D version even though I already own the DVD and Blu-Ray versions.  The IMAX 3D format is how I originally experienced this wonderful story that our family has read at Christmas every year going back a ways.  It was also my first modern experience with 3D at the IMAX back in mid-00's.  It was incredible in IMAX 3D, with snowflakes close enough to reach out and touch and the dancing waiters on the train and many, many other portions that were designed for the 3D effect.

Since I had invested in a 70"" Sharp Aquos Quattron 240 Mhz LED 3D television, a higher end, Pioneer Blu-Ray 3D player and seven sets of the powered, three switch mode (3D mode, 2D while the TV is displaying a 3D picture mode and an off mode) 3D glasses, I had to have this movie in 3D because it played a big part in my acquisition of a very high quality, complete 3D system that didn't break the bank.

At night, when watching this movie in 3D in darkness, it is amazingly like the IMAX 3D experience. Same snow flake effects, right in your living room or home theatre.  Wow!...

For those of you who are reading this and are considering purchasing a 3D System (TV/Blu-Ray), you should be purchasing a LED Full 1080p system that uses the powered glasses until the glass-free systems become truly workable and reasonable in price. You will not be happy with the non-powered glasses and non-LED experience. Yes, it's less expensive but if you really want 3D, don't go cheap, if you want to see great 3D effects. You should also purchase an extended warranty and a locking wall mount. I wouldn't just set this behemoth on an entertainment cabinet.  Plus, you can get very high quality multi-dimensional wall mounts that allow for tilting and swiveling, so that you're not locked into a specific furniture arrangement permanently.",1366156800,,1818,4.624223602484472

2341446,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The character is a young boy who is starting to doubt the existence of Santa Clause. Trying desperately to believe but having only evidence that Santa is a fallacy the boy ends up on a journey filled with Christmas ""Magic"", faith and belief. What makes this movie so good is that everyone can relate back to the time in their lives when they to were starting to doubt and where desperate to cling to the last bit of magic. This movie does such a good that the viewer not only explores this time in there past but actually feels like they are a kid again trying to believe. The story, musical score and affects/scenery are so good that you may forget you are watching a movie and believe (for a little while anyway) that it is actually you on this magical journey. After the film ends you can feel a little bit of the residual magic in the form of that tingly anticipation we all remember oh so well. An excelant movie that ""bring back the Christmas Magic"" of childhood and will leave you with a warm feeling and sense of wonder.",1363219200,,1028,4.359375

2341450,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I didn't hold out much hope for this film, but it got to me. Enough to buy it on DVD, and enough to replace that DVD with the BD.

I know that a lot of people don't like the motion capture technology that serves as the technical basis for this film. Yes, the people look a bit plastic when compared to actors, but they don't look that plastic when compared to animation, which is really what one should be using as a standard. Robert Zemeckis and his team have gotten better and better with this technology, and it well serves this film, even if it isn't at the advanced level Zemeckis would achieve just a few years later with the Disney/Jim Carrey ""A Christmas Carol.""

Definitely worth viewing every year during the holiday season. The story is unique, unpredictable and positive.

Frankly, we bought it because my son is obsessed with trains, and this movie has the best CGI train I can find.  We skipped to the scene where that huge chunk of iron is screaming across the ice because that part took our breath away.  We laughed and gasped as if we were on a carnival ride.  (Put your kid on your lap and lurch to the side now and then...it's awesome while watching this scene!)  After a while, my son wanted to see more of it, so the songs and dances became a bonus, and he loved the action at the end with Santa's sleigh taking off and the kids sliding around on factory equipment.

2341602,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I watched this with some initial skepticism. In retrospect, that was perhaps the best approach, because by the end of it, I was as caught up in the magic as were the young, nameless adventurers on the train.

The animation itself is quite captivating, and adults should watch for cameos - one or two of them hilarious. Action sequences are breathtaking and there is no violence to worry about. Tension in the story comes from anything that might be important to a child - loss of ""magical"" Christmas feelings, worries about getting into trouble, and the thrill of an independent adventure.

I don't have young kids, but I did wonder if a couple of the scenes might be too spooky or intense for very small children. It might be worth a preview if your little children have active bedtime imaginations, but then, I may be too cautious.

As for adult viewers, this is a rocket ride back to childhood, with plenty to keep you entertained in grown-up asides. There is nothing saccharin about it, and if you have any trace of holiday spirit left over from your early years, you'll be swept up in the draft of the Polar Express.

2341630,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Got this as a gift for my nephew, but ended up loving it myself when we watched it over Christmas together.  There are some publications that claim children under 3 years old either:

a) shouldn't watch 3D Blu-ray movies because it's not good for them
b) may not have the depth perception/binocular vision to really appreciation the 3D

The first one doesn't really concern me, because I don't think those concerns have been substantiated, and (for what it's worth) my 2 year old nephew really seemed to think that the 3D was cool--don't know if it was that he actually thought that the movie was cool, or he just enjoyed wearing the 3D glasses :)

As for the adults, we all really enjoyed the crystal clear clarity of the movie and the additional depth added by the 3D effects.  This movie is wonderful for all ages, and a must-see every year around Christmas.",1357257600,,861,4.601307189542483

2341640,4,B0009XRZ9M,"There is so much to drink in this picture!  But I think ultimately it is a film about believing...and after seeing this, you will still ask yourself if you believe.  It is a eye-popping rollercoaster thrill ride to see Santa's castle and workshop up at The North Pole.  It is definately visual effects heavy, bolstered by some of the best effects people in the business, notably some of Lucasfilm staff lent a helping hand in the production of this joyride up north.  Without giving too much of the plot away, the film centers around the adventures of a boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus, who wants to believe through the jingle of Santa's magic sleigh bells.  The boy literally hops aboard The Polar Express as it pulls up in front of his house, and suddenly he is whisked away where his adventure begins...all over the train, inside and out.  Then upon arriving at the North Pole, we go on a further adventure in and around Santa's toy factory.  It's all a real feast for the eyes, with surprisingly good music along the way.  Classic holiday songs are woven into the soundtrack at Santa's factory, lending more of an old-fashioned holiday feel to the experience.  It is dark and moody at times so you may want to caution your kids that it's only a movie.  My favorite sequence is in the train car of ""recycled"" toys, where the boy is called a Scrooge and a doubter by a mysterious hobo who seems to live on top of the train throughout his journey, and comes to the boy's aid in moments of peril.  Was this character meant to be a sort of antithesis of Santa Claus?  Will the boy ever hear the jingle of Santa's magic sleigh bells?  Well, hop aboard The Polar Express and decide for yourself!!!",1357171200,,1706,4.5

However a check of that dealers site that day showed that he had 16 copies of the exact product that I ordered in stock and available for sale.

I enjoyed the hot chocolate dance scene the most with runner up being the kids on the big tree at the North Pole.

Notable voices by Tom Hanks and 80s Eddie Deezen. I'd know the latter voice almost anywhere.

The movie has certain deviant qualities such as kids leaving the pack to find their presents from santa and the cunductor is a bit on the harsh side.

2341738,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The blu-ray presentation of this is superb.  I sometimes have trouble with other blu-ray discs in terms of the sound being too highly contrasted to enjoy it.  This is not the case with this version.  The dialogue is clear and the special effect sounds aren't too loud to warrant reducing the volume.  One of my cats was completely startled when the train pulled up in front of the house for the first time.  It felt like an earthquake when played through my Sony ES system with six B&W speakers.  He ran around to see what was coming from the back and was a bit startled.  The visual is superb and I knew I hadn't made a mistake in getting this version over the regular DVD.

The story is fantastic, although some of the action is a bit nerve racking and four of the characters I found a bit creepy.  I'll let you decide which one they are.  Seeing around that, its a great story especially toward the end.  The overall impression of this digitally animated film is one of nostalgia.  I ended up in tears because of its cathartic beauty.",1356480000,,1037,4.4

2341743,1,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie is just plain weird. It's literally the kind of movie you'll watch as a kid, grow up and look back 20 years later and say, ""man, what was that one creepy Christmas movie i saw as a kid????"" There are no comforting Christmas elements in this movie. Although it starts out with an interesting premise, it is strange that the train guy doesn't know the first thing about babysitting kids. Why would Santa hire this guy to pick up children???? And the near death experiences riding on the train, once again, begs the question, what is wrong with Santa endangering the lives of children? The dancing waiters, creepy. The elves, creepy. The fact that they wore red instead of the traditional green---creepy. The way they talk, and express themselves ""do you trust me?"", the crazy industrialized north pole, just none of it seems Christmas-y to me. Mind you , there's no Mrs. Santa Clause either, and what was Steve Tyler doing as a singing elf??? Just plain dumb.

The only good thing was the whole concept of the bell, which could have been developed throughout the movie, pressing on the theme of belief, but seriously, if i were that kid, i would rather not believe.",1356393600,28,1174,4.671497584541063

I thought it was the type of 3D that I could watch on my 3D TV but it wasn't. It was the kind of 3D technology that came with the red and blue lens paper glasses of the 50s technology for a move made in 2004. I figured we'd bit the bullit and try to watch it with the glasses they included. When we put the movie in, the movie was so blurry we couldn't even watch it. The red in the glasses was also so dark you could hardly see out of the lens. It was total crap. So we put in the other regular movie included and it was blurry too and the volume was so low we could hardly hear it even with our surround a sound turned all the way up. I'm throwing this DVD in the recycle bin since it's not worth a nickle. We ended up watching Polar Express on Netflix and enjoyed it tremendously. I'm sorry that I didn't check this DVD out earlier. It looks like a cheaply produced copy and shouldn't be on the market at all. I'm VERY disappointed that I got ripped off like this but I guess you get what you pay for even though it was sold as new it surly wasn't one that was factory produced.",1356307200,,1198,3.9139344262295084

As for the 3D/Audio/Visual - simply stunning.  This movie was made to be seen in 3D.  I couldn't imagine seeing it any other way. Probably the best overall 3D effects I've seen in a movie, the action was non stop!  The audio was also great, i only have a 2.1 setup but when the train pulled up i felt like it was in my living room!

The audio overall was good, great use of music and sound effects.

But this was a rare exception. I *had* to buy it. Loved Tom Hanks in the part. The story was heartwarming, and the animation was well done. It was just a wonderful way to enjoy a beautifully-done, holiday-themed movie.

I got the standard definition, as that was all that was available at the time. I considered buying the Blu-ray version afterwards, but honestly, the picture I got was so good, I'm not sure how much better the Blu-ray version could be. I may still end up buying the Blu-ray edition in the future, but for now, I'll enjoy my standard definition.

Boy were we wrong...the train ride is scary, the hobo has a very creepy laugh, comes across as more of a criminal than a Christmas spirit.  The North Pole reminded me of my travels in East Germany and many of the other Stalinist Soviet Union places I have been.  I almost gave it two stars because my boys loved the hot chocolate scene, best part of the movie, and a few other small parts; but I decided against because it was just a little too creepy overall.

2341833,4,B0009XRZ9M,"My 2 year old niece and I enjoy this movie.  It's magical, fun and of course, it has Santa Clause.  I like this story because it actually has a good plot to it.  It teaches kids lessons about what Christmas is all about without the mention of Christianity.  I'm Catholic but my sister (niece's mother) is no longer religious.  So this movie helps because it's teaching my niece to be caring, respectful, ""good,"" and most of all, that Christmas is a time of love, family and magic.

Polar Express is motion pictured COMPUTER animated (different than pixel).  But I think that this gives the movie a dream-like state and really able to give nice colorful imagery.  I'm not sue how accurate this is to the children's book (getting that through Amazon - expected in fed-ex on 12-19).

The characters are very entertaining and helpful to teaching kids about bravery (hero boy), manners (protagonist girl), shyness (Billy), and to not be such a know-it-all. Also the girl helps teach kids the true meaning of Christmas Spirit.  The plot is about the hero boy who questions whether Santa Clause is real (nothing else religiously).  He wants to see for his own eyes this Santa.  And after he falls asleep, the Polar Express Train arrives to take him to the North Pole and Santa's Village.

My 2 year old loves the train when it arrives in front of the boy's house.  She enjoys the boy's journey on the train, as well as his new friends.

She's not so keen on scenes that introduce the hobo.  And there are some parts where the hero boy seems like he's in danger (she says ""Oh no. Oh.."").  So to my young niece's perspective, there was some scarry scenes.  But I assure her that the boy is brave and that he can do it.  I felt that the hint that this was a dream was too small.  I liked that hero boy answered that it didn't matter that it was a dream.  But we don't really get that dream acknowledged in the beginning.  It might have helped a little.

The 2 year Old's favorite part is of course Santa.  There are times where she'll actually cheer along.

I enjoy the whole movie and I recommend this for the Christmas Spirit Cheer.",1355788800,,2124,4.46875

The red /blue glasses are really hard to adjust to. We had to really work with the brightness, contrast and sharpness settings on our TV. In the end my youngest daughter and I adjusted to the glasses and the 3D was wonderful! For my husband and oldest daughter, the 3D never worked quite right and was very disappointing.  A 3D version made for a 3D TV with regular glasses would be so much better.  I am not usually a huge 3D fan but the effects in this movie are worth it!",1355616000,,650,4.233870967741935

Beautifully presented, wonderfully animated, great moments of both action and serenity, I believe that it is unfair that ""The Polar Express"" isn't already mentioned in the same breath as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""A Christmas Story."" It certainly is in the top five of all Christmas movies, if not the top 10, with a meaningful-yet-succinct storyline and fantastic acting by the entire cast (Tom Hanks in particular, of course).

I did not care for it much when this movie first came out, but my dislike is softening with repeated viewings.

The first problem is the plot...

or lack thereof.  When you remember that the original is a picture book for children, getting 100 minutes of comprehensible animated film out of that is going to be a problem, and unlike the similarly challenged creators of the much better IMHO&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumanji/dp/B000B6CODO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumanji</a>, the creators of the Polar Express movie didn't have available the obvious course of just lengthening each game turn scene.  Instead they inserted a couple of roller coaster wild ride scenes.  The extended wanderings through the eerily empty work environs of the North Pole quickly grow tedious but the long, long sequence involving losing (and finding) Hero Girl's ticket, meeting the Hobo and traversing the roofs of the cars, roller coasting down the steepest drop in the world, and ice skating with a train, is arguably the high point of the movie.  It also makes no darn sense whatsoever.  Just for example there is no SANE reason for anyone, ESPECIALLY the Conductor and Hero Girl, to be walking on the roofs of the cars!  In addition, after all of that friendship forming under pressure and adventure, I was disappointed to find that none of the children, not even Hero Boy and Hero Girl, seem ever to have met again.

Note: One reason for purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0009XRZ9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two-Disc Widescreen Edition</a>&nbsp;is because it contains a deleted scene which among other things reveals the origin of the Hobo;... not that this will make this character's actions any more comprehensible though!

Finally, there is the problem of the Motion Capture process itself.  As movie reviewers at the time noted, computer animation resulting from motion capture just looks creepy to those used to other forms of animation.  This is a near fatal defect in what is supposed to be a warm would-be Christmas classic but, making a virtue out of a necessity, turns out to be just what you want when making a creepy instant Halloween classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-House/dp/B000IFRT2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster House</a>.",1355529600,2,4267,7.791322314049586

Personally, I love the older movies that I grew up with about 30 years ago, and even those before then, but for a modern day movie, this one ranks high among the younger generation.  The graphics are very realistic and pretty neat.  I will say that it leans on the darker side a little and some characters and/or scenes may be too scary for certain children.  It just depends on the kid.  If your young child(ren) are only used to happy, calm characters, this movie may be too intense for them...for example, the conductor comes across pretty harsh and angry most of the time and another one of the characters appears to be a ghost and is a little creepy at times.  The whole film takes place at night, so it's mostly dark, too.  All in all, it's a great movie though!",1354838400,,869,4.366459627329193

2341916,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Approaching this film with much trepidation and fear that it would be another saccharine kid's movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it avoided most of the cloying aspects of the genre.  The story is a delight from beginning to end.  The 'tongue in cheek' gruffness of the Conductor (Tom Hanks) saves his scenes from going 'over the top'.  Technically, it is breathtaking.  Even after several viewings, it never fails to amaze me.  A film for all the family to enjoy.",1354665600,,476,4.7560975609756095

It has a great story and adventure. I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan, but he does an amazing job and plays many rolls, some of which I did not recognize his voice until I read the credits. We originally bought the DVD, but there are so many parts in the movie that would be enhanced by blue ray, so I have now ordered the blue ray as well.

The hot chocolate scene has always been my daughter's favorite and it really pops to life. If you have a 3D TV, don't miss out on this. There appear to be two versions of the 3D; one version utilizes the blue/red glasses and one requires active 3D glasses. The version this review refers to is the active 3D glasses version.",1354665600,,501,4.340425531914893

We sat together on the couch the entire movie and he was totally engrossed, occasionally saying ""that's not real"" or ""I know what's going to happen!""

2341943,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Tom Hanks ""Hits It Out of the Ballpark"" again his usual high quality produced movie. The Computer Generated Special Effects are great and I more than once caught myself starring at the characters to see if they were ""Real"".This is a movie that the family and yes even a 60yr old Grandfather like me can watch together. Hanks would make ""Walt"" proud.",1354406400,,349,4.645161290322581
2341944,1,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie's catchword ""Believe"" defines the secularization of Christmas. Believe in what? Nothing, really. The magic of childhood imagination, narrated by a syrupy adult? A little boy has a Christmas Eve experience saturated in secular Christmas symbolism: a mysteriously beautiful train ride ending in the North Pole, snow, Santa, reindeer, a magic roller coaster ride through ice.

It is clearly really happening and not an ambiguous hallucination, but despite the many proofs, the little boy - like secular adults confronted with Christian belief today - doubts and angrily refuses to believe any of it. Only at the end of the movie does he make an act of will and finally ""believe"", then he is rewarded with proof and a lifelong ability to ""believe""... but his belief is in nothing bigger than his secular vision.

I was disgusted by this, and by the wholesale subsequent adoption of ""Believe"" as a Christmas sentiment, when the entire purpose of the movie is to propose belief without any object, a vague nice feeling with no foundation, and a message that goes nowhere - a pat on the back for nothingness where something larger ought to be.

I would still have given the movie two stars, because some of the animation is interesting and lovely, but most of it is not. I caught a copy-paste-loop effect many times. So, overall, I'm rating the movie on the plot and message, which I thought was ultimately false and shallow.",1354320000,3,1429,4.896694214876033

2341947,5,B0009XRZ9M,This is a sweet movie that fits nicely with the few other great movies for the holidays.

2342051,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Let me start of by saying I had seen this movie in standard 2d before I saw it in 3D.  I generally liked the movie in 2D, the plot is slow at parts but the ending makes the move worth watching.  But I am not writing this review of the 2D version but for the 3D version.  Let me start off by saying WOW!  This is the best 3D movie I have seen yet on my home TV to date.  This movie is made for 3D.  I am not talking about the crappie made up 3D with the red and blue glasses, but the real thing.  Some of the parts that dragged in the 2D version were not meant to be seen in 2D, but in 3D.  There were times when I was watching the 3D I wanted to back up and watch the scene again but having seen the movie I also could not wait to get to some other upcoming scene that I knew would be great in 3D so I was torn between rewatching the scene or moving on.  The 3D train ride down the steep slope, the slide across the ice, and the North Pole scenes are breath takingly stunning with very little ghosting.  As I stated before I just wanted to watch and rewatch these scenes over and over again (good thing I own the Blu Ray, so I can now do just that).  This whole movie is taken to a new level with the 3D. The 3D in this movie should be studied by every film maker looking to make a spectacular 3D film.  If you previously bought this movie in the 2D version and your TV is a 3D, buy a copy in 3D.  It will be the best upgrade you bought all year.  If you don't have the movie yet, get the 3D version.",1353628800,,1500,3.766025641025641

2342063,2,B0009XRZ9M,"I recently purchased The Polar Express... again. The plot is cloying, the central theme revolving around cardboard characters. The backgrounds are exquisite. The faces of the characters are likely frightening to younger children and are extremely off-putting, in particular, the character of the main female lead. Plot points are made with a sledge hammer... repeatedly, but as my wife said, for little kids, that might be appropriate. But some of the scenes would probably frighten little kids.

I wanted to like this. I like Tom Hanks, I like Christmas and I like Christmas movies. This one though seems geared to getting Christmas presents, characters are introduced and leave. The subplot labored, all in all, unless you are a fan of commercial Christmas, I would suggest giving this a wide berth.",1352764800,2,801,5.161538461538462

2342073,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express(released Oct/04)stars the voice talents of Tom Hanks,taking on a myriad of roles from train conductor to Santa himself.
The film is about a young boy in Grand Rapids,Michigan,who is just on the cusp of growing out of his belief in Santa and Christmas. One Christmas eve,while lying restlessly in his bed,a huge old multi-car train pulls up in front of his house. He walks out into the snowy night and up to the locomotive,just as a conductor farther back yells ""all aboard"".He is at first reluctant to get on the train but decides,as it pulls away,to take a chance. What happens from there leads him and a train car of other children(about a dozen in all),on an adventure that will change their lives forever. It is a journey of self discovery and realization and the true meaning of Christmas.
The train ride takes up a good portion of the film when we finally arrive at Santa's village,about 50 minutes into the film. This is a village like no other you have seen before. It is more like an old town and it is filled to the brim with elves and their elaborate working areas. The young boy makes close friends with another girl and a younger boy and together they end up in the town square just before midnight and are witnesses to a pageantry like no other you will have seen. The boy finally comes to recapture his belief in Christmas,and given that Christmas's very first gift by the man himself. All good things of course must come to an end and off they return home,but none ever the same again.
There are so many neat moments/people in this picture,such as the conductor,the ghost who rides the top of the train,the engineer and fireman,the roller coaster ride just before Flattop tunnel,the skidding of the train over the frozen lake,Santa's village,the precarious placing of Santa's bag onto his sleigh,the pageantry before his departure,and so much more. It is all a fantastical and beautifully animated Christmas film that will warm your hearts on a cold winter night.
This DVD comes in a light metal container in which is the DVD in a regular case. It is in a w/s format.
This is a film for children of all ages. It is a modern classic,and you will NOT hear me saying that too often. Highly recommended.",1351555200,,2233,4.6272040302267

One of my first movie purchases was this movie.  When I made the purchase I didn't follow my usual rule of reading reviews on Amazon first.  As I waited for the movie to arrive I decided to read the reviews I became concerned.  A lot of people gave the 3d version poor reviews, but look a little further and you'll find that most of the reviews are for the 3d version for a standard television.  In short I own many titles in 3d blu ray format and this is amongst the best in my opinion.",1351209600,3,642,4.178861788617886

2342078,1,B0009XRZ9M,"I bought this movie in 2008 when it was released, because it's one of my favorite holiday movies and how much fun would it be to watch it in 3D?!

First, the 3D is poorly done. Second, the glasses are just cheap cardboard. Third, put those two things together and you get a headache.

I attempted to watch it with my nephews and we tried watching in seats, on the floor, various levels, and nothing worked. Nothing looked 3D at all. The glasses didn't want to stay on and were made of cheap cardboard. Even with the glasses on you could still see the red/blue lines on the picture. After awhile we all got a headache and gave up.

I'm sorry I ever spent the money on the 3D version. Looking forward to upgrading to Blu-Ray, but I think I'll pass on the 3D version there too.

2342098,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Personally, I love this movie. I'll admit, I'm a bit bias, though. I did grow up seeing and reading this book in school and I think the film is as beautiful an adaptation as any. I sent a copy of this to a friend for her young son and was shocked when she reported back that her family didn't like it. I'm pretty sure they turned it off and never finished it. It was, apparently, too creepy for her fiance. Yes, that's right, her fiance.  While I can admit that there are a couple scenes that do not follow the guidelines for your average, family, holiday film, I think ""creepy"" is a little too strong a word. Then again, that's what makes the world go around.

I think this is a gorgeous, thoughtful movie that is deeper than many others. The music alone is wonderful, but the whole experience is artistic and meaningful. My family has made it a tradition to watch it every Christmas Eve. We'll be doing that for years and years to come.",1346630400,2,938,4.323863636363637

It is a completely worthless piece of trash, complete with these cheesy red/blue glasses that are supposed to render a 3D effect.  I thought I was getting a genuine passive 3D premastering of the film that would add the additional quality on the trailer I saw.  For the $31 price tag I think this is not unreasonable.  Additionally, Amazon does not segregate the reviews posted to their site well, so you are reading reviews for other products in the view of your considered purchase.  This is the first criticism I have ever had of Amazon to be frank, but I am blisteringly angry at this two bit rip-off of a good customer and intend to show my anger by making NO future purchases until I receive some satisfaction on this matter.",1342828800,,1020,4.702247191011236

The movie itself is one of the all time greats, but I know there are people who don't like it because of the way that the people look - very close to real, but not quite, like  wax museum dummies.  If you don't mind that, the story is a flawless tale, describing perfectly all the things children think when they start questioning the Santa Claus mythology.  There is a surrealistic quality to the story-telling that makes the main character repeatedly ask if the events are real or just a dream.  The events bring to mind every Christmas movie and promotion that has ever shaped our ideas of what Santa and the North Pole should be, exactly as it must seem in the mind of a 10 year old.  The music is beautiful, and sends shivers up my spine.

I recommend this movie to everyone.  With that said, I believe we're here to review the sale of this particular disc set (The Polar Express Presented in 3-D (2004) for $7.79), not the movie itself.  If you're looking to buy The Polar Express in 3D, don't bother buying the disc set that states ""Presented in 3D"" on the front cover.  This is not true 3D.  It comes with 4 pair of passive 3D glasses; which will just give you a headache the first two minutes of viewing.  I tried using the Active 3D glasses from my Sony Theater system, but they just kept turning off because there was no 3D signal coming from the sync transmitter; an indication this disc is not 3D.  Another disappointment was that there were some scenes missing between the two disc included in this set.  We viewed both discs and found that each disc contained some scenes the other disc didn't have.  For these reasons I am only giving this purchase one star; because I didn't get what I thought I purchased.  I blame myself for not reading the reviews before purchasing.  This experience is a reminder that ""You Only Get What You Pay For"". .I should have realized that $7.79 was not going to get me this great movie in 3D.",1331683200,15,1371,4.461847389558233

Though it does have many good qualities and I enjoyed some of it, I felt the filmmakers took out much of the warmth of the story and focused too much on the cool high-action effects they could incorporate. It distracted from the magic this story could have woven, and I can imagine much of it actually being scary to kids--who I thought were the intended audience.
Also, again...with what looked like the intent to appear ""cool"", rather then genuine, Christmas town looked cold & industrial, rather then enchanting. I don't think these people get what childhood is about...It felt like creating something wonderful for kids was not their focus, but rather all of their their special new software and equipment they got to tryout.",1331510400,,813,4.856115107913669

2342157,2,B0009XRZ9M,"The more I have seen of this movie the less I like it. My 3.5yr old likes it so I have seen it, or parts of it, quite a few times recently.
The graphics are very good, with amazing attention to details. In some cases it is absolutely brilliant with the reflections or expressions being very accurate or the body movements as the kids run along a squashy conveyor belt. But a scene where hot chocolate it being handed out and, more importantly, Santa are pretty poorly illustrated. The elves also look awful. The graphics is the reason for adding 2 stars. I have deducted stars for:
-The storyline is all about a boy who has started to doubt the existence of Santa and boards a magical train to the North Pole to see him. There is nothing about kindness or love or any of the real messages of xmas, it is all about presents and proving Santa exists.
-The train conductor is unneccesarily stern and intimidating.
-All the employees are incompetent, the train drivers who break and lose parts, lose control of the train and endanger the passengers, the elves who fail to lift the sack of presents high enough and nearly kill someone.
-What is with the spooky hobo/angel? He is mean and sarcastic but then helpful. But the way he gets hit by a low bridge and shatters into thousands of shards of ice is just scary for kids.
-There is just a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Why is the train so long when there is only one carriage of kids, one of toys and presumably one of hot chocolate servers? When they stop to pick up the last boy another boy comments on that being strange because he thought Hero Boy was the last pick up. How does he know who is last? What is the significance of this last minute addition? Nothing, as it turns out. Once at the North Pole the conductor asks all the kids to line up in two rows, odd birthdates on one side, evens on the other or some such. Why? If believing in Santa is so important why are such a small group of kids chosen to see him? When the main girl character loses her ticket the conductor takes her away, out the back carriage to walk across the train roof to the front and puts her in chanrge of driving th train while the driver changes a lightbulb. Why? And why is it when she is removed from the kids' carriage there is discussion and panic about her being thrown off the train for not having a ticket? The Boy From The Poor Neighbourhood has never received a present and understandably does not believe in Santa so why bring him to show him Santa is real and has, what, just chosen to never give him a present? Why do they all keep walking around on top of a moving train in a blizzard in only PJs and slippers? I wear a down filled coat anytime it is below 50F/10C even if sunny!
-The whole movie just seems to be building up suspense and questions that go unfulfilled. Near the end the conductor calls out something to Hero Boy who doesn't hear him and replies ""What?"" so the conductor calls out louder ""Merry Christmas!"". But there is the uneccessary suspense that the conductor has called out something significant and Hero Boy might miss the message.",1328400000,3,3109,4.362068965517241

Read some internet ""Best 3D movie"" recommendations and Polar Express was on every list as being a really good one. Most of the movie has great 3D effects as far as the ""Diarama"" type 3D. What I mean by that is there is a lot of depth. Like looking through a window. There is one great ""Pop-out"" scene where the front of the train seemed to come out about 4' or so.

I think that a great deal of the credit for this is the quality of the original 3D.  Most Movie makers do not  realize that 3d in a movie is a separate art in itself, as is either color or black and white.  It seems to me that most 3d movies today have the 3d tacked on as just a way to get few extra dollars on a ticket price. This film is an early use of 3d that wasn't surpassed until Avatar.

2342174,4,B0009XRZ9M,"The movie is great to begin with, adding 3D just enhances the experience. The 3D version does a nice job of providing depth as well as some occasional images that pop off screen. For those that want the screen to jump out at you, you will be disappointed, but in my opinion, 3D quality is both about the depth and screen pop combined. Too much of either and not enough of one can leave the viewer dissatisfied. While it does not have a great deal of pop, it does have enough and excels at screen depth.

As the Polar Express makes it's stops, it picks up more children who are approaching adolescence and the age of doubt.  Children from all walks of life, rich and poor enter the train, for a great adventure to the North Pole.

2342207,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express taps into our affirmation that Christmas is believing, that believing is good, that being good will always be rewarded, and that we must keep faith with our beliefs and our dreams or they will disappear into the lost innocence of adulthood.

Hungering for a classic of some kind that would remind me of the larger-than-life Christmas stories of my childhood, I started to watch this even though I had passed it by with channel surfing warp speed dozens of times before. It wasn't long before I realized I might be watching a classic I had been yearning for.

It is Christmas Eve and a little boy is fighting sleep with a rising skepticism in the belief of Santa Claus. A check of his atlas by flashlight confirms that the North Pole is an uninhabitable and barren place, just before he jumps back into bed one blanket ahead of his parents opening his door.  He hears his father whisper to his mother about the end of the magic, which he thinks has something to do with the belief in Santa. Later, and still awake, the sound of a train's whistle and its cars with yellow light blazing from passenger car windows, appear on the snow in front of his house. In robe, pajamas and slippers, he heads out to explore when a conductor asks if he's going to get on board. His adventure to the North Pole, on the Polar Express begins.

He meets a sweet-looking, wholesome girl who is as trusting as he is doubtful, a nerd who hides his doubts behind glasses and know-it-all obnoxiousness, a later, younger arrival who only seems to trust his own solitude, and a hobo who sounds cynical and kindly at the same time.

The animation was so good that the children almost seemed real. Tom Hanks lent his voice to at least three characters I could identify, and the music, especially the song ""Believe"" was absolutely enchanting. The story is how each of us react to our doubts and fears that some things are true or that some are not, that the strongest things to believe in are the things we cannot see or hear. In the end, we find out if our hero, the skeptic can still hear the bells when they could no longer be heard by others.

Here's hoping you can hear the bells in your Christmas--and still believe.",1325116800,2,2210,4.485074626865671

2342210,2,B0009XRZ9M,"Everyone in my family loves the ""Polar Express"" book, but when we saw the movie, we were just disappointed.  For one thing, they did the story all wrong.  The book never mentions some creepy hobo who rides the top of the train.  That character is just too scary for young kids and doesn't fit the story.  And one of the main themes mentioned is ""seeing is believing.""  That cynical message does not belong in a magical film like the Polar Express!  I also must say something of the animation.  When this film came out, everyone was excited because it had 3D animation!  Whoopdedoo!  Because 3D animation was so new, everyone was willing to overlook the fact that it made the kids in this movie look like martians.  Nothing looks realistic: the facial expressions, the way the wind doesn't ruffle their hair, the way their mouths move, e.t.c.  Besides all this, the songs are just ultra-cheese and made me laugh out loud, and the MC does stupid things like almost getting killed just to save a train ticket.  And was the nerdy, so-obnoxious-you-want-to-turn-off-the-movie character really necessary?  Maybe he was meant to add humor, but he's just annoying.
All this being said, I really wanted to like this movie because I love the book.  And I'll admit, some of the scenes are pretty magical.  And who doesn't love a movie about Santa and Christmastown and Elves?  But this movie had too much stupid dialogue, cheesy songs, and lousy animation on the people characters to be enjoyable.  Along with the unwelcome of the creepy hobo and the nerdy kid (who has a voice like nails on a chalkboard) and a few not-so-relevant messages, this movie is one you can miss.

I wanted to purchase it, but hesitated after seeing the many very negative reviews about the quality of the 3D version, One way I figured to not get confused by these reviews - see the item purchased: those writing about more recent single disc 3D BRD seem to like it. So I bought that latest version. Do note that this Blu Ray disc DOES NOT come with any viewing glasses etc - those purchasing that edition appear to dislike it.

You will need both your BRD player and projector/TV to be 3D capable. It is FANTASTIC in 3D. The movie just comes alive, and the 3D effects are simply excellent. The effects are so real and in the moment, that the kids were trying to reach out and grab every snowflake.

I suspect that those reviewers who did not like it are referring to a previous 3D version released in 2004 (I have not seen that one), or perhaps there was some problem with their equipment.  It worked beautifully for us, and the kids simply loved it.

Bottom line: if you have true 3D equipment do not hesitate to get THIS 3D version of this classic movie. Happy Holidays!",1324771200,,1196,4.393665158371041

I had purchased it a few months ago when I purchased my LG 55"" 3D TV, and was waiting for this time of year to finally watch it.  My 10 year old and 7 year old joined me (they had already seen the standard 2D version.

We watched using the passive (gray polarized) 3D glasses, and I thought the 3D was fantastic.  There is a scene early on where it looks as if the front of the train is coming about 3 feet out the front of the TV! The train/rollercoaster sequence along with snow flakes in 3D was very cool. The 3D along with this kind of animation really worked, and I think made this movie even more magical than I thought it would.  I cannot imagine it would have the same effect on me in the 2D, but ya never know.  We also had the LG surround sound set up, and the train ROARED!!!  Awesome!

2342234,5,B0009XRZ9M,"When this film first hit theatrical release back in '04, all the ads hyped all the special effects, the theme-park roller coaster aspects of the train's journey north. This stoner I roomed with at the time enthused: ""Dude, that flick must be awesome to watch when you're high."" Not exactly the sort of testimonial that impresses me--I detest the videogame-looking garbage he calls ""a good movie"". I've been to an IMAX house just once and wrote that particular cinematography genre off as ""no story or plot, so they beat you up with special effects"" fare. No entertainment value so you get cheap thrills. So I said no thanks.

About four years ago I broke down and rented the thing. So now I watch it every year. It goes to show how a bunch of doofuses who put everything into only two categories--""Awesome"" or ""that s**cks""--have really trashed the entertainment landscape. Another customer here observes ""charitably"" that it's a good movie despite it's being a bit short on plot. And in a way, that's true. If they took a lot of the action stuff out, they could show this as an ""Afterschool Special"". Because mainly it's about four kids, three of whom for one reason or another are ""outgrowing"" Santa Claus. One is our storyteller, who the end credits call ""hero boy"". He's the one who's in all the action sequences--recovery of a ticket that blew away, helping to regain control of a runaway locomotive, you name it. Another is a cynical, sharp-voiced kid who knows all the answers and bombards you with them. You just know that he's one of those kids who calls all other kids by putdown nicknames. A third is a poor kid who lives in a ramshackle house and no doubt has a very sparse Christmas tree in terms of what Santa puts under it. But the real star is a young black girl who the end credits call ""hero girl"". One lady I used to date was the type who could brighten up a room just by walking in. She was always the first one to make some sort of gesture of kindness to someone who was bummed out about something or felt out of their depth. And whenever something good happened to you, she was at least as happy about it as you were, if not more so. To this day I believe she was the proverbial ""Miss Right"", but it never worked out for us. I used to speculate what she must have been like as a kid. And ""hero girl"" strikes me as my theories about my ""old flame's"" childhood personified.

It's quickly obvious why the three boys are on this train trip, but we have to gradually find out why ""hero girl"" is there. After all, she's about as ""together"" a person as you can get. So we learn it's because she's needed as de facto peer leader. When the poor kid gets on the train, his inferiority complex makes him not join the others, so ""hero girl"" is the first to spot that and heads for him. At one point he begins a musical ""soliloquy"" how Christmas always has left him out and ""hero girl"" promptly joins him for her side of the issue. Their duet is the song ""When Christmas Comes To Town""--""shy boy"" in a wistful but resigned tone, ""hero girl"" with her heartfelt reply about the joy that Christmas means to her. The other day I downloaded that song and played it on my MP3 player. I've still got it stashed in a Christmas music folder. I'm reading all sorts of comments here which add up to ""geez, they oughta have some pro do a cover of it"". When I did a search for it here, there were a couple of other versions. I think I'll pass on those--nothing's going to ever match the original. Every time I watch the movie, the song makes me a bit misty-eyed. After a few years of rentals, I finally broke down and bought the Blu-Ray version.",1324252800,2,3641,4.384615384615385

If you're thinking you can watch this movie with your 3D player & TV & glasses, think again.

2342255,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Are you looking for a holiday movie that is uplifting? Strap your seats in and enjoy this ride to self-discovery for several children in this fantasy.

No film is perfect. One problem with this one is that the story is not feature film length. So there are a lot of exciting scenes of the train/children on roller coaster tracks that are enjoyable and breath-taking but do not contribute to the story. By the end, it seemed a little too much. But not enough to take away from the story.

Tom Hanks is excellent in the several roles he takes during the movie. The special effects live up to their name. And I like it when special effects are a thing of beauty as they are here, as opposed to being used for ugliness as they are in horror movies.

I will always say this. I don't believe children should watch movies or TV without the accompaniment of their parents, regardless of the rating. This allows the parents to be in the habit of knowing what their children are watching and provide opportunities to take advantage of teachable moments. But this is definitely family fare.

Let me close with comments from my particular world-view, which is Christian. One plus side is that it shows belief as an important source of joy in a person's life, as any Christian can testify. Two dangers. 1) Is the emphasis having faith rather than the object of faith? 2) Is faith seen as independent of reality/reason? There are other things that might make some Christians uncomfortable -- it almost seems Santa's being worshipped by the elves.

The caveats I mention should not keep you from enjoying this excellent fantasy.",1322956800,,1613,4.665492957746479

Im a big fan of Christmas movies and have never found it scary. I just wish Id known it was a Christmas movie when it was in the theater although in hindsight which is twenty twenty the word polar should have been a clue. What these people call scary I call thrilling and entertaining. To each his own I guess unfortunally. A little kid is unsure of the existance of Santa Claus so a train takes him to the north pole on Christmas eve. Thats all it is. The fact that it had a little action in it is just coincidental. That was probably done to keep viewers interested and all of you people who said it was to scary have obviously either missed the point of the movie or not bothered to watch it long enough. Or worse yet both. The conduter is trying to get the boy to believe. In Santa Claus. God. Something. Anything that you don't have to ask questions about.

2342278,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I and a friend went to see this movie when it first came out. We are both over 60 but our hearts are young.  The theater was jam packed every seat taken. The thing that jogs and amazes my memory about the experience is this. I would have to say the audience was 80% children and young at that. But in amazement during this movie at least to a point you could hear a pen drop. And that point is when they reached the north pole, only then could you hear some murmuring. That memory of how entranced everyone was will always stick with me. I just wish though that they had not released this movie to dvd. This movie is so good I wish they would just re show it every year at the movie houses for everyone to enjoy again. And yes I believe and always will.

Ok now we fast forward to 2011, my old standard tv went out and it would cost $300 to fix. Hmm. So its merry christmas to me , new flat screen 47"" LG 3d. So now Im reading all the horror stories about the 3d versions of polar express done in 05 08 so I take a chance and get the updated 2010 of this 3d movie the one that shows the train on the ice on the cover.  I still rate it as 5* for the 3d. Of course the most prominent 3d effect is when the train stops on emergency and nose comes out in your lap. But for the kind of movie this is the 3d effects are quite satisfying. In a great portion of the movie faces bedposts etc are extended or appear to be beyond the screen. Also there are moments of snow falling in your living room just like happened at the theater. Most 3d movies will say to sit 2meters/6ft from the screen to get the full effects. 3d is one tv effect in which it pays to sit close. Get this version [2010] if good 3d is what you want and you won't be disappointed.

2342282,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I enjoyed the book as a kid, and this movie was very well done. Great animation, wonderful wintery setting that makes it feel like Christmas even if you watch it in July, and it's such a fun, exciting adventure to go on. It makes me, personally, feel like a little kid again while watching the children go on this train through a winter wonderland that apparently isn't 'real' in the sense that only the children can 'see' the whole thing. Not that I ever went on a train on Christmas Eve before, but I think you get my drift. All in all, this is sure to be a classic film just like the Rankin Bass TV specials 'Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer' and 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town'. The reason I gave it 4 stars, however, was due to the Santa Claus scenes in the movie. Now, I'm not against Santa, but in this film, he came across as this god-like figure. Examples: His beard was glowing like maybe an angel's face would - a symbol of holiness?; He had an air of 'all-knowing' and 'understanding' about him that really reminded me of the person of God. Santa, in this movie, was portrayed as this deity being who was worshiped by his imp-sounding elves, who, upon the entry of the 'Big' Man' into the town square, all sang a verse from 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town', which was pretty eerie; it reminded me of some hymnal chant? It was more disturbing than exciting I must say. But besides that, this film is full of cinema magic from the music to the animation to the story, it all makes it feel like Christmas every time you watch it.",1317168000,8,1535,4.314878892733564

My advice, stick with the standard DVD and save yourself some cash so you can buy something like Inception that will make your eyes pop and is a pleasure to listen to.

2342305,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Damon Medic says, ""The Polar Express"" is one of the most uniquely original films of our time.  It is certainly not your typical Christmas movie.  In fact, it has a very mysterious, dark overtone to it, even when it comes to the depiction of the North Pole.  Santa and the Elves create a spectacle of monumental significance.  The mere scene of the amount of elves seems overwhelming!  It is hard to explain, but the view of the elves ""en masse"" as opposed to individuals adds a mystique to this film that makes Christmas itself seem more magical than it is normally presented.  Tom Hanks plays the train conductor who picks up the children who need to believe in Christmas again, or perhaps even for the first time.  He punches the childrens' tickets in the form of words that are customized to the needs of each child.  Eventually, the children are delivered back home with a new faith in Christmas.  True to it's unique flavor, the star child in the movie receives the ""first gift of Christmas"" which is a bell from Santa's sleigh.  Those who don't believe, cannot hear the bell, and believe it to be broken.  Those who believe, will never stop hearing the bell ring!  This film is a must, to complete your Christmas movie collection.  Wonderful for the entire family, to be watched year after year.

A magicial, imaginative and well done CGI animated fantasy that is very faithful to the popular kids book by Chris Van Allan. This is one of the first attempts at photorealism in CGI animation before Avatar perfected it, it feels a little plastic and crooked at times but who cares. Tom Hanks plays all 5 different characters and even has a voice by Steven Tyler in two roles, Robert Zemeckis has made an enjoyable and wonderful Christmas treat for everyone.

2342339,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express is a wondrous piece of movie making, destined to join the ranks of must-see Christmas classics, for children of all ages. I have read numerous reviews. Some say this film is too dark. Really? No darker than the original illustrations that accompany the author's masterpiece book. I would call it very atmospheric. Other reviewers don't like some of the animation effects. Well, overall I think the producers did an excellent job using animation to create and sustain the larger-than-life feel of the story. If it has been shot in regular film, I believe it would have lost a lot of its flavor and impact. Just like a good watercolor or acrylic piece of art has much more evocative power than a photograph.

The bottom line is that Polar Express is a great story, and the essence of Van Allsburg's classic has been very faithfully rendered in this movie, and in so doing, the people who labored to do so should get a lot of credit (especially considering the garbage that passes for holiday movies these days). This is about the innocence, faith and wonder of childhood and how it is stoked (and sustained) by the magic of the Christmas Season. I defy anyone with a heart to sit and watch this movie with some young children and not get choked up during the last 10 minutes or so of the film, after Santa makes his entrance. I guess those who aren't moved by this film have long stopped hearing the beautiful ringing tone of the bell. But I'd bet anything that your great-grandchildren will be watching this movie with their kids at Christmastime, along with It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Carol, White Christmas, Rudolph, and a few others.",1293062400,,1659,4.701030927835052

2342341,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I have always loved the book ""The Polar Express,"" so when the movie came out I was excited to see it. This year I finally bought the DVD because my daughter (3) is old enough to really be excited about Christmas.

The visuals in this movie are stunning. The music is beautiful. The plot is basically the same as the book (boy who worries he is getting too old to believe in Santa goes on a midnight train ride to the North Pole on Christmas Eve) with some extras thrown in to fill out the movie's run time. Some of the new scenes are excellent (the ""hot chocolate"" dance) others are a bit of a miss (caribou on the track? okay) but overall the movie is fantastic.

I was worried parts of it would be too startling/scary for my daughter, especially since she has not seen a lot of TV or movies, but overall she loved it. I would not let her watch it alone but with me there to laugh off some of the scarier moments (tense moments where the train almost crashes, a scene where the main character almost falls off the ladder on the outside of the train) she enjoyed it. I am sure it will be a family favorite for years to come.",1292716800,,1124,4.175115207373272
2342342,4,B0009XRZ9M,"When I first saw this film in a theater, I wasn't sure I liked it.  The CGI was incredible, especially the hair of the various characters and the textures of the fabrics--Santa's bag was an incredible and very real velvet.  Yet the thought of small children being ""picked up"" by someone, without the knowledge and consent of their parents seemed a little creepy, despite the unlikely presence of a train in their front yard, and not the best model for behavior.  With exposure, however, the film takes on more of the aspects of a roller coaster ride and while exciting is not quite so creepy.  Even the ghost becomes less threatening with time.  I would suggest, however, that parents discuss the dangerous issue of going with anyone unknown to them for any reason whatsoever with their children after the film.

The color and quality of the film are incredible.  Almost anything that can be done with a computer seems to have been done here.  The lifelike quality of movements was exceptional; my favorites were the sudden and very purposeful movements of the animals:  wolves, a herd of elk, an eagle and Santa's reindeer.  The movements of hair and clothing were also wonderful.  The eyes of the various characters, however, seemed a little too staring and gave the faces a wooden aspect, so this is still in the realm of the sophisticated cartoon. The real character of specific objects was also very varied.  Without knowledge of context, the sleigh bell in the final scene would be almost indistinguishable from a real bell.  Yet much of the train and other items were business-as-usual cartoons.  Similarly, while some people were almost hyper-real, others were simpler cartoon characters.  Contrast with the conductor, who looks very much like Tom Hanks, and the engineer and coal stoker, who were totally Saturday-morning cartoons, was at times a little jarring.

I was a little disappointed in the fact that so many of the parts were played by Tom Hanks.  While he is undoubtedly a gifted actor, it seemed that there might have been greater dramatic variety if the interpretations of the different characters had arisen from seperate individuals.  The children's roles were wonderful; and their singing voices exceptional.

The most incredible and exciting scenes--and certainly those that illustrated the great potential of computer generated virtual reality--were the roller coaster-like trips down steep inclines on the train and the slipping sliding trip across the lake of ice.  One had the same sensations from viewing the film as one might have had actually undergoing the real experience.  I was totally impressed.

The story is a perennial one, the loss of belief in ""magic"" by the young.  Though simple, almost everyone has been there in their time.  One almost might say that the whole story was based on the adult wish to prolong their own children's belief for a little longer--perhaps even their own, at least for the duration of the film.  Altogether, the exciting adventures, the comraderie of new friends, and the wonderful message of belief in the spirit of the holiday made the film a great success for me.",1292716800,,3135,4.982692307692307
2342343,5,B0009XRZ9M,"My  6 year-old son is a HUGE train lover.  The Polar Express is one of his favorite movies of all time.  We owned a toddler version of the book, we own the actual book, we own the DVD, the 3D version of the DVD, and now the Blu Ray 3D version.  Blu Ray 3D blows them all away.

The story, about a boy struggling to believe in Santa, is a wonderful journey to the North Pole.  Seeing it in real 3D for the first time was like actually BEING on the train!  I gasped when the train pulled up to the house, it was that incredible (and this from someone who has seen the film dozens of times!)

Since Amazon seems to aggregate all reviews under each version, if you own a 3d capable blu ray player and television, please look for the version that says Single Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo.  There is another ""3D"" version of the film that comes with the old school blue and red glasses - this is NOT what you want.  Trust.",1292630400,8,916,4.124293785310734

Of all the new Blu-ray 3D movies I have, this is the worst and most disappointing - especially after seeing what was possible with this movie in the IMAX. as with the anaglyph 3D version of this movie, the image on this Blu-ray 3D ghosts terribly which absolutely ruins the entire movie. The only advantage over the analglyph version was an obvious improvement in the picture color.

2342350,2,B0009XRZ9M,"First off we bought the ""original"" bluray 3d version that came out last year with the horrible red/blue glasses. We love the movie and have a 3d tv (Mitsubishi 60"" DLP) and we wanted to get another 3d movie after watching A Christmas Carol (which had great 3d effects). The 3d was not good in this movie at all. If people are saying it is, they must have a different version than we do, or haven't seen a good 3D movie. It almost made you feel cross-eyed in some of these scenes, as they tried to make the depth to deep on some objects which creates a blurry image. It wasn't just me, my whole family felt this way. The 3d was put into this movie AFTER it was released in theatres so it wasn't made FOR 3D. Any Disney 3d movie blows this out of the water. No effects ""leaped"" off the screen, and even our 7 year old daughter was left asking me ""What was 3d"". Dont waste your money on this version, just buy the regular version for the lower price. I love the new 3D movies, and we have watched Monsters Vs Aliens, A Christmas Carol, and Alice in Wonderland. All of which included great 3d Effects, and none messed with my eyes at all like this one did. The train rollercoaster scene was cool but it was cool before 3d.

Reviewers a bluraydotcom had this to say so I'm not the only one unimpressed:

""The 3D elements might best be described as ""serviceable."" There's nothing at all special or unique here; The Polar Express 3D gives off a ""so what?"" sort of vibe, one that certainly looks good and stable at-a-glance but never really captures the imagination or excites the senses in quite the same way as the best of the currently-limited Blu-ray 3D releases. Depth is decidedly average, and nowhere near as good as A Christmas Carol.""

I won't try to say anything more about the movie than you all ready know, but I'll opine this: for over $30, the value is NOT there. There is NOTHING with this bluray. At all. It's the disc in a blue box. That's it. No literature, nothing. I feel totally ripped off. The fact that the bluray was that much to begin with is bad enough. I know, I know, some people will tout BD Live, others will say it's a movie, not a book, but when I pay this much for something, I expect there to be some value in it.

2342354,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I saw this movie (actually a shortened version) at Stone Mountain, Georgia last weekend where it was billed as being 4-D. The 4-D came from the 3-D presentation along with some physical effects such as vibrating seats, water sprays, hot chocolate smell, etc. added to it. While the train was skidding sideways across the ice, water was being sprayed on my cheeks and it felt just like little sprinkles of ice hitting me! But the real star of the show was the 3-D. During the rollercoaster train ride it almost felt like I was on the train. And when the waiters were tossing hot chocolate around to the kids I almost expected to get hit with a cup. This is a movie that is made much better by 3-D. If you have a 3-D TV I would suggest this be one of your movie purchases since you won't have to worry about buyer's remorse when you get home.

My very first experience with 3-D was at the Central Florida State Fair in Orlando in 1967. At the Chevrolet tent, Chevy had set up a dish-shaped screen about 15 feet in diameter in front of a few rows of folding chairs and showed a short commercial video on it. The video started off with some folks on a swing and I felt like I was moving back and forth with them. Next came a trip down into the Grand Canyon on a mule; a jostling, jaunty ride that was utterly realistic. Before long the viewer was put in the driver's seat of a 1967 Corvette Stingray that was in a race. The sensation was so real that I was rocking side to side as the 'vette hit the corners and when it came to a screeching stop I almost flew off the front of my chair. The entire thing was done without using glasses! That level of 3-D has yet to appear for consumers, but perhaps someday it will.

I'm glad to see that the studios are making 3-D movies that use something other than red/green glasses available to home viewers. The first 3-D movie I ever saw that used these new types of glasses was in 1978 and was titled ""Frankenstein 3-D"", a monster movie that made the most of the technology. The visual effects were spectacular, at some points bordering on sickening, such as when a spear was thrust completely through a person, shoving an organ out of the front of the abdomen and dangling it at a point that seemed mere inches from my nose. At one point in the movie a bird appeared to fly directly out of the screen and toward my face making me flinch. This made me hunger for more 3-D. Unfortunately the viewing audiences of the day weren't quite ready for that and after one more visually-stunning, but not very profitable, 3-D film about invaders from outer space things went back to 2-D.

If Polar Express 3-D is any indication, we're entering a great time for watching movies! I only hope we don't end up with competing formats that make buying the necessary equipment perilous for the pocketbook.",1291507200,4,2825,4.377142857142857

I would not let children under 13 see this - I think it should have been rated PG 13  not PG

2342361,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I find it hard to believe that anyone who has watched this with their children can not love this movie. There was one review that stated it was ""creepy"". I don't think so, I think it is just tapping into the magic of Christmas, is it really more creepy then the 3 ghosts that visit Scrooge? Again it is suppose to have a magic feel and magic is usually considered super-natural. Others said that the charecters are cold and cynical, I do not find that to be so. They are not so mushy and lovey as so many other kids specials, but personally I like that better. It makes them more human, and more realistic.

I think this movie captures the imaginations of children and adults, and I am not someone who likes to watch much TV. My husband and I both enjoy watching this with our kids.

The 3D is VERY GOOD...in fact it's great on so many levels. The colors are vibrant and vivid and not washed out like many have complained happens when watching movies in 3D from dark glasses. Also, the picture quality was top notch in HD even while wearing glasses. The surround sound effects and audio couldn't be any more realistic and complementative of the video. The 3D was spectacular guys. Many scenes had things popping right out at you (which i love) and the depth was deep and realistic. I actually felt like I was in the movie. I have an 82 inch 3DTV so that helps but a crappy 3D movie is a crappy 3D movie no matter what screen you watch it on and crappy this was not. The 3D on this film will make any television pop and sizzle and truly brings out the power of your new 3DTV to your family and friends.

Overall watch The Polar Express is a wonderful holiday experience anyone should have the opportunity to enjoy and if you're looking for a good 3D movie then this is a must buy as you will not be dissapointed. Furthermore I experienced no ghosting at all while watching but that could be due to my televisions technology compared to plasma, LED, and LCD. Pick up a copy for yourself. You won't regret it.",1289952000,49,1497,4.362007168458781

This 3D film has set the 'bar' for 3D expectations and this film was a convert 2D to 3D vice native 3D.  I expect we will see even better 3D effects if native 3D

One stand out scene in particular is portrayed on the front cover of the Blu-Ray case, the train skating on the ice.  The 3D effects are so fantastic here that I had to play it over a few times.  Its enough to make you say WOW.  Also, the entire North Pole scene is absolutely beautiful especially the zoom outs showing the large Christmas tree and all the kids and elves surrounding it.

2342372,3,B0009XRZ9M,"The theme of this film - believing in the xmass spirit - didn't quite work with me.  I watched this with my kids and while they enjoyed it, they though a lot of it was rather strange.  First there is the spookiness of certain aspects of the train, like the bum who seems to live on the roof and appears at dangerous moments.  Then there are the sudden flights on huge hills or around the town at the N pole.  The kids are suddenly in an adventure that you know is destined to turn out OK, so they are there to use the special effects and maintain interest.  (The technical quality is also low, with wooden movements by the characters and gestures that don't look all that real, though perhaps we are now spoilt by Avatar.)  Finally, you get the xmass themes, but they are weirdly done, with creepy-looking elves you don't know you can trust.

The best part of the film are the personalities of the kids, in particular the 3 principles.  There is a skeptical boy, a lonely black child, and an inhibited kid who probably comes from an unhappy or dysfunctional household.  They do interact well, even if they don't quite look alive.  You do feel some of the magic of xmass thru their eyes.

Clearing the mist from his window he sees the most amazing sight--a gleaming black train rumbles to a stop right in front of his house, the steam from its powerful engine hissing through the night sky and the softly falling snowflakes. The boy rushes outside, clad only in his pajamas and slippers, and is met by the train's conductor who seems to be waiting just for him.

This warm-hearted, delightful family movie was instantly our favorite Christmas movie and all-time family favorite.  We waited an extra year for the home version of POLAR EXPRESS 3D to be available in DVD format.  Blockbuster got the movie in stock in time for my wife to purchase it for my Christmas gift.  We opened it up on Christmas evening, expecting to get the same warm feelings as we did at the theater.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT when we turned it on, followed all the instructions and tried to look at it through the 50s CHEAPO-STYLE CARDBOARD, RED & BLUE glasses.  BLURRED IMAGES, RED & BLUE STREAKS, FADED OUT COLORS, MULTIPLE FACES AND ARMS convinced us that this was a BAD PURCHASE!!!!  The 3D effects were limited to snowflakes and a few distance shots.  But it gave you a BAD HEADACHE the first five minutes.  We tried to return it to Blockbuster for an exchange for the 2D version, or a refund.  We were told, ""We don't exchange any movie after it was opened,"" and ""It's not our fault!"" by the insensitive clerks.

My now 16 year old daughter insists that we watch this movie before everyone goes to bed every Christmas eve, so it is now a family tradition. We were very excited about the blu-ray 3D version and bout it when it came out last Christmas.

What a rip off! The blue and red lens glasses are a joke. No matter how much you increase the brightness and contrast of the 1080p HDTV, the images are blurred and doubled. The red lense is so dark you can barely see any light through it at all, even looking directly at a 100W light bulb. The high price for this extremely poor quality product is purely criminal and should be illegal; and would be if this country still had the false advertising laws we had when I was a kid.

I noticed that Amazon has grouped together all reviews for The Polar Express; the movie itself, the DVD, the regular 2D blu-ray, and this lousy 3D version. This practice hides the true rating of this poor product and on first glance would indicate there are 392 five star ratings for the Blu-ray 3D Polar Express. This is false advertising in itself and shame on Amazon for this unethical practice. There are actually ZERO four and five star ratings for this product! To all who are contemplating buying this trash product, don't waste your money. Buy the staight 2D blu-ray or DVD versions. The movie itself is wonderful.",1262044800,3,1407,4.449612403100775

The North Pole workshops look like some sort of dark, severe, lonely factories where one could easily get lost... and that no elf would even want to work in for 364 days a year... but then again the elves might have well been robots, by the way they looked acted.... no personality!

2342428,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Christmas makes saps of us all, and if Hollywood knows how to do anything it's how to make a few nickels from our sappery - how else can you explain Playboy bunny Jenny McCarthy having not one but two holiday movies playing on The Family Channel (!) this year?

So it was only a matter of time before America's most beloved movie star, Tom Hanks, found his way into America's most beloved holiday.  Re-teaming with Robert Zemeckis (they previously worked together on two little independent films you might have seen, ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away""), Hanks gets to play five different roles thanks to motion-capture technology and Zemeckis's desire to push digital filmmaking to new frontiers.  It's a bit of a distraction for the adults who keep trying to find Tom Hanks in the various digital characters, but since it's Tom Hanks we don't care too much (we also don't care that his train conductor's Chicago accent ebbs and flows like the tide).

But ""The Polar Express"" is a kids movie and should be judged accordingly.  On that level, ""TPE"" is a near-triumph.  Our hero, an unnamed boy of around 10-12 years old, is doubting Santa on Christmas Eve.  He is old enough to spot the chinks in Santa's armor he is in danger of Not Believing In Santa.  Then, as he searches for slumber on Christmas Eve, a huge old-fashioned locomotive pulls up in front of his house, somewhat shocking because there are no train tracks.  He reluctantly climbs aboard and is off on an adventure of a lifetime, rocketing down the tracks towards the North Pole along with several other kids in various stages of Christmas skepticism.

Visually, ""TPE"" is a stunner, whether it's capturing the beauty of a winter countryside, churning your stomach as the train shoots down a 179-degree grade at Glacier Gulch, or meandering through Santa's charming red-brick home town at the North Pole.  This is animation that's one step away from reality, in a good way.

Sure, there are some glitches.  A quick song-and-dance number serves as a reminder (along with Richard Gere's performance in ""Chicago"") that not all movie stars are ready for musicals.  The Josh Groban ballad ""Believe"" gets a little tired, and the appearance of Steven Tyler from Aerosmith as an elf to sing ""Rockin' on Top of the World"" reeks of a blatant attempt to increase soundtrack sales.

All things considered, while ""TPE"" is not going to knock either the Grinch (cartoon version) or ""A Christmas Story"" from their perches  as the top Christmas movies, it's a proud addition to the family DVD library - a welcome excuse to ignore the latest holiday pseudo-entertainment from secondary ""talents"" like Ms. McCarthy.",1261526400,2,2655,4.866666666666666
2342429,2,B0009XRZ9M,"I have owned the book upon which the movie was based since it was first published. It was in our home before it received the Caldecott Award and I have read it to my baby daughter every year since it was published. She and I hear the bell and we always will. There are few books that compare favorably with this one.

 The movie is something else again. The film maintains the general story line of the book while complicating a sweet and engaging story in a manner that is neither necessary nor appropriate. It takes less than ten minutes to read the perfect story and it takes ten times that for the the movie to run. The book never fails to maintain an interest level from start to finish and the movie does not.

 Get the book, read it to your baby girl on the evening of December 23, watch her eyes grow wide, read The Night Before Christmas to her on Christmas Eve and again watch her eyes. Listen with her for the ringing of the bell and you will hear it. And, you will see it in her eyes and she will see it in yours.",1261353600,6,1025,4.135678391959799

You can only see out of the blue eye. When we adjust the brightness/contrast, you can see more with the red eye, but the movie appears not as vividly. The 2D version shows much better color. And this 3D version is nothing like the 3D in the theater when we saw this at IMAX. We could see the ""golden ticket"" flying in front of your face. This home-version 3D doesn't do that.

Unfortunately, what would have been a really solid Christmas story has been transformed into something eerie and creepy. The child-like images are strange as are all the other characters.

In particular, his high-pitched screechy voice for the train ghost and conductor is like nails on a chalkboard.
Some of the music is very good, but the classic renditions like ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" sung by the elves... Again, very strange.

The movie, however was way too scarey for him starting with the very loud  noise of the train when it came into the yard.

My husband and I got an instant headache just by watching it for a few minutes with the 3-D glasses on. We tried the blue ray dvd player and even real 3-D glasses from the theater... nothing worked. To their credit, a few scenes were OK, (we skipped the movie to the most visually stimulating scenes), but generally speaking is not worth to hurt your family's eyes when the original version is almost 3-D by itself!

The 3D glasses provided did not seem to blend the separated colors together enough which made for a weak 3D effect.

2342521,5,B0009XRZ9M,"My wife and I have seen the IMAX 3D version twice which was the finest 3D experience ever.

I knew of the problems with the 3D Anaglyph process on the DVDs.  There are 2 ways to minimize the problems.  You need the sharpest, brightest, and clearest images to make it work.  I bought the blue ray version and bought two pairs of optical quality 3D Anaglyph glasses (we bought the ones with the blue and red lenses) from an internet 3D specialty shop (Amazon might also sell them).  The glasses run about seven dollars each and will also fit over most eye glasses.  They will work with some other 3D DVDs but not all (they will not work with Journey to the Center of the Earth, for example).  The websites will tell you which movies the glasses will work with.

My wife and I find that the 3D effect from these glasses is much much stronger than with the cardboard glasses that come with the DVD. The image also is not blurry due to the optical quality of the glasses, at least with blue ray DVD.  I also turned up the brightness on the TV which is recommended.

There are two faults with the Anaglyph process that cannot be avoided.  The colors tend to be washed out and you will see ghosting (double images) sometimes.  When we watch the DVD, we don't concentrate on the ghosting, and after a while, you are so wrapped up in the 3D, that you don't notice it as much.

For us, it was worth it to buy the optical quality 3D glasses as they were so cheap.  However, I do not think that these glasses will help if you get headaches and may not work well for everybody.

One thing that we noticed was how much better the characters' expressions look in 3D than in 2D.

So for us, the blue ray 3D DVD was worth the cost.  It is not as good as IMAX 3D, but it works for us.",1230508800,,1766,4.192878338278931

Sometimes you can get the feel for how wonderful the real truely perfect 3D must appear but in this version,it is only a showdow of what I know the theater version must have produced.

Knowingly selling this sub par production is a crime and every fan that had hoped to see ""The Polar Express"" in 3D at it's very best should be given double their money back.

2342538,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Yes, yes people. Since I have some time while the elves are wrapping all the gifts and feeding the reindeer, I decided to write this worthy review for you. You say you didn't know I was filling in for Santa this year? Well. I had to. This is what happens when Santa donates big bucks to your ill-fated election campaign. Or is it doe? Ah well, you get the gist.

Because the season is right, I decided for an excellent holiday movie for your consideration: The Polar Express. I saw this seasons ago when it first came out and I was so impressed with it that I had to have it on DVD. I suggest you all get a copy quickly before Father Time arrives on New Year's Eve. He can be very cruel to those who don't listen to the wisdom of Metamorpho. Heck, he's cruel to everyone. Last time I looked, no one was getting any younger.

Anyway, let's climb aboard The Polar Express awhile and discuss the movie. It centers around a young boy who's losing the magic of his childhood dreams. Everywhere he looks, there are signs that point to the non-existence of Santa Claus. How preposterous. That's like saying Seers don't exist, which, of course they do, if you'll just ignore those catcalls you hear.

So, on Christmas Eve, the boy hears this train rumble and stop in front of his house. Do keep in mind he tears his robe pocket in his excitement to see the train up close. That action is a major factor throughout the movie and is the main motivator towards a lot of what happens.  Reluctantly, the boy climbs aboard and is soon treated to a variey of children. One kid is so nerdy and annoying that I'm sure part of the audience prays for him to be thrown from the train. But the other characters he meets are fine; the tender-hearted girl and the lonely and sad boy.

As we learn, the train is heading towards the North Pole with Tom Hanks as the constantly checking stopwatch Conductor. The journey is amazing. Zemeckis uses CG Technology (a digital process) to convey an outerworldly and mystikal feel to the movie. The whole train ride is a cause and effect freefall of many ideas. Whether it be surreal acrobatic waiters serving hot chocolate, the excursion of the girl's lost train ticket (a journey that makes Forrest Gump's feather pale in comparison), or the roller coaster train ride as it double times across breaking ice, you will certainly be treated to eye-popping special effects throughout the whole movie.

The theme of the movie is belief, without which, Santa nor Christmas could truly exist. But, more than that, it is a retraining for people who have lost the magic of Christmas. In a way, the movie beckons us to learn to grow young. As Tom Hanks says to the child, ""Seeing is believing. But, most real things we can't see"".

They reach the North Pole and more mayhem ensues as our major children get lost and wind up in Santa's toysack. The awe and magic of the North Pole town is yet another wonder. Add into that, the townsquare scene with more elves than there were people at Woodstock cheering as Santa makes an appearance. All these scenes create light hearted pomp and joy to this movie.

I will not reveal all the surprises here. But, do see it. It will be a marvel to you forever. In the end, when the boy exits the train, the Conductor tells him, ""the true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart"". And Zemeckis drives this point home with an enchanting movie such as this.
True, when this movie first came out he was criticized for the digitalization of the characters. The critics brayed that it was not a success. Let me tell you, the critics lied. Everytime I have seen the movie I think my imagination has taken over and I see more into it. It is a magikal cinematic method for a magikal movie. Very appropriate. And, ironically, the movie's motif was belief, which those critics obviously missed.

I consider this movie a heart-warming Christmas classic which all people can enjoy. It is about the spirit within all of us. It is universal. I urge all of you to get a copy quick, or else, you might find coal in your stocking this year. And to answer your question, yes, I might reconsider. But many accolades and serious fawning are required.

Anyway, a fine, fine movie to add to your collection.

Happy Hollidaze------ Metamorpho",1229472000,,4261,4.520779220779221

It is still better to watch it WITH the glasses than without...IF you press them really tight up against your face, but that's about as good as it gets!

2342543,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I saw this movie with my son (Age 21) in December of 2007 in an IMAX theater in Harrisburg, PA.  Needless to say, it didn't disappoint.  we purchased the 3-D version of the Blu-Ray a week ago.  Although it could NEVER be IMAX, we thought that for a home version, it was fantastic.  I don't understand all of the negative reviews.  Perhaps these folks are expecting the world for $25[...], but realistically, it is worth 10 times the price.  We purchased some higher quality 3-D glasses with the movie because the cardboard just isn't that comfortable.

We turned out all of the room lights and watched the movie on our 52 inch DLP TV.  After allowing 10-15 minutes for our eyes to adjust to the glasses and lighting conditions, we watched the movie with a fairly critical eye.  There were times when there was some ghosting of the images.  However, for the most part, the $25 DVD along with the $7.95/pair 3-D glasses we purchased, was FANTASTIC.  Like I said, it will never equal IMAX, but for home viewing, if you let your mind go, and allow yourself to be a kid again, you'll have a fantastic time watching this soon to be, Christmas classic.

The folks who have reviewed this and hated it are undoubtedly the same type of people who can't enjoy a magic show either.  You must watch this movie in the context that you don't have an IMAX theater in your home, but rather a home sized screen.  If you can open your mind, you'll really enjoy this!  But you must keep things in perspective!!!",1229126400,,1491,4.4907063197026025
2342544,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is the best Christmas film I have seen in a long, long time. It certainly has all of the elements that should appeal to kids -- fabulous wintery landscapes, a magical locomotive, roller coaster-esque scenes, elves, leaping reindeer, Santa himself. By the same token, it is clever enough for adults, with a delightful double layer to it revolving around faith -- more specifically, believing in the true, giving spirit of Christmas and taking an optimistic view even when facing bleak circumstances.

The animation is excellent, although sometimes movements seem awkward, jerky, and sharp rather than fluid and natural (something that especially stands out in the Hot Chocolate scene). In some ways, I wonder why they animated this instead of making it a live-action film. That said, the animation is downright amazing at its best. Environments and props look convincingly real, and sometimes it's uncanny how closely the people look like, well, people.

The characters themselves are so-so. The little girl was almost too good (I stress ""almost""). Billy -- the poor kid -- was all right, but seemed more like a stock character than a fully fledged individual. I most enjoyed the protagonist, the tramp, and the conductor -- especially the conductor, who showed that sometimes firmness and sternness can live in close quarters with kindness.

One downside to this movie is that it's very long for a kid's movie -- smaller kids might find this a bit daunting. Another thing that will probably appeal to adults alone is the tramp; little ones might be frightened by his shenanigans.

I don't think you can go wrong with this film, however. The narrative is strong, the protagonist's personal development is very moving, and the story ends with a very moving tear-jerker sure to fill you with optimism for days. Personally, I love all the little touches -- the unsaid messages are all too fun to catch, and Tom Hanks voicing the narrator, the tramp, the conductor, and the father has some delightful connotations.

I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.",1229040000,,2061,4.979651162790698

We followed the viewing suggestions in the DVD case.  We tried some of the solutions suggested by other posters on movie  boards.  I even tried another type of 3-D glasses that came with a rollercoaster video I have from years ago, nothing helped.  So glad they included the 2-D version, as that was excellent.  A suggestion: Try viewing the 2-D version using the 3-D glasses.  It made the colors really shine and stand out, even added a depth to the scenes where proper 3-D would have been most breathtaking (the Northern Lights, the ""rollercoaster"" type scenes, etc.).

Do not expect that from the home version but I found the results on an high resolution laptop or an 52 inch LCD to be quite pleasing for the piddly price one pays for the DVD.

Here is what I think most complaints result from re: the 3D.
The cheap, cardboard glasses are not comfortable......Be glad they provided them for 16 bucks and two discs.  A bargain.
The red is a darker red and is over the left eye....Most viewer's dominant eye...
The cyan is on the right and much lighter..
So then..... One's focus, because the dominant eye has such a darker color, wants to shift over to the right eye being dominant......(easier to see through the much lighter color) (That's why a bright screen really helps_the red then doesn't look so dark and the eyes don't try to shift back and forth...
This shifting of dominance between left and right really goofs up peoples comfort level in trying to view the film.
I found it greatly helps if you try to maintain your dominant eye-view through the left side when it tries to shift to the right eye...
Once you get used to this,.....The clarity and comfort level is much greater and more enjoyable.

Well that excitment was crushed when we got home, put it on and were almost given instant headaches from the old school red and blue 3-d glasses and the fact that no matter how hard we tried to see it, it just was nowhere near 3-d quality. We sat there contemplating whether or not it was just us or if the 3-d aspect of it sucked that bad and we came to the conclusion that it was definately the latter. So after a half hour of trying hard to like it we switched it to 2-d (thank god for blu ray for having that option) and saw how in 1080p it was almost 3-d itself.
Needless to say the very next day I went back to the store I purchased it from and changed it for the regular blu ray version (which was $5 cheaper than the 3-d version and totally worth the purchase, 5 stars for that version.)

If you haven't purchased it yet, avoid it like a petrified fruitcake.  I saw this film in 3D Imax and was so enchanted with the 3D effects that I couldn't wait for a 3D release of the DVD.  I was disappointed to see on the packaging that the 3D used the red/blue method which generally eliminates the color scheme of the movie right off the bat.  (I noticed that the 3D version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" which was released the same day came with the more modern polarized glasses with the neutral color.  I haven't seen that yet and can't comment on the success of that process with that particular DVD)

What makes this presentation of the Polar Express in 3D such a failure is that THE GLASSES DON'T JOIN THE RED AND BLUE CHANNELS INTO ONE IMAGE.  Everything in the mid to foreground is seen in double vision which is extremely annoying.  We switched to the 2D version less than 5 minutes into the film because it was too disconcerting to see 2 chins...4 arms...etc.  Whoever made the decision to present the film in this manner should be fired for incompetence.

The bottom line is that THE 3D EFFECT IS SO INCREDIBLY SLIGHT that it can't outweigh the major problems with the faulty technique.  If you enjoy this film, as I do, avoid the disappointment and skip this disaster.  Maybe they'll try again in the future with a more successful presentation...until then...do yourself a favor STICK TO THE 2D VERSION!",1225584000,36,1575,4.542553191489362

Too bad they couldn't have duplicated the great 3 D that was shown in theatres. Warner Brothers should learn to perfect this system.

Also...the 3D effect is so much better with JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF EARTH (this time going red/green glasses why can't they at least give a better 3D effect with this great holiday movie.

2342574,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Haven't watched the entire movie yet in 3D, but from the few minutes that I have watched, the 3D quality is not what I had expected. One would think that after decades of motion picture improvements, that 3D technology would be included in all recent releases. For instance, I have viewed just a few minutes of Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3D and I also had the pleasure of seeing it also on the big screen in 3D. What a marvel. Two huge thumbs up for Journey in 3D. However, I cannot say any thumbs up for Polar Express. If you watch the extras from the standard featurettes, you could see there was an awful lot of hard work to put this motion picture together. However, when you see the actual 3D version of this movie, one's expectations is greatly reduced. So if you have a high quality set of 3D glasses that is configured for the distortion of the 3D affect of the picture, then I would suggest watching the 2D version. This way, you can still enjoy the movie and not be disappointed.

Here's what I was able to see during the first few minutes of viewing the 3D version. First, the depth of the imagery wasn't as displaced with using the issued 3D glasses that also shipped with the package. During the movies, one could see the over shot of ""Red"" beamed off to the left of the objects centered. Meaning you STILL got a blur when viewing the movies using the ""CHEAPLY"" made 3D glasses that was shipped with the DVD. IF you must experiment with the 3D version, recommend buying a higher quality version of the 3D glasses. I plan to buy a higher quality 3D glasses that are configured for this DVD. BTW, the 3D glasses that come in the Journey to the Center of the Earth movies is not compatible with Polar Express 3D. And if you kept the 3D glasses that you watched JTCE from the big screen, they don't work either. So with this being said, I give the 3D version a big fat 3 stars. Only because there is a little bit of 3D affect and the quality of the story itself rates a star, but nothing more than that.

A message to the film makers. If you are going to support the high expectations of your audiences, then spend a nickel to buy better quality 3D glasses that can better support your movies in 3D.

A message to the general public. Anyone got a decent pair of 3D glasses they want to sell?

I originally saw Polar Express in 3D on the IMAX screen (which utilized polarized 3D glasses).  It was an awesome spectacle!  The 3D effects were so crisp, clear and beautiful.  If you buy this expecting it to look like it did in the theater, you'll be very disappointed.

It seems that the 3D polarization technique used at the movies theaters (for releases such as ""Polar Express"", ""Journey To the Center of the Earth"" and ""Beowulf"") is not yet used for home DVD presentation.  Had I done some research before this purchase, I would have known this.  Instead, it comes with 4 pairs of the old style anaglyph (red/blue) glasses.  The 3D picture was not good.  I could still see double images (which looked like ghosting).  My eyes were far too distracted to watch it that way.

It has become a holiday treasure even for me, and I am a die-hard fan of the holiday specials from the 60's and 70's (with the one exception of ""A Christmas Story"" which came out in the 80's). That being said:

LET'S NOT EXPECT AN IMAX 3D EXPERIENCE HERE, PEOPLE!!! LOL

This DVD comes with 4 of those old-timey glasses that have blue on one eye and red on the other. The 3D effects are fair to middling to decent, definitely adding to the experience for me, and I'm just watching it on a small 13"" laptop so far.

What is especially nice is you get the non-3D version (in widescreen) on a separate disk in this case, so if you don't already have it, you're getting two for the price of one.

I'm curious to see how other folks experience this product - perhaps on larger screens, flat screens, etc., the effects might be better.

I saw it last year at IMAX in 3D and there is just no way to duplicate that on a home system. Considering the comparatively crude electronics most people have, this 3D version is pretty good.

2342577,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I just bought this thinking that my kids would love watching the trains in 3D as they're all train fanatics.  Unfortunately, the movie just doesn't pull off 3D well in the transfer.  It's a host of double images, poor color saturation, and a whole bunch of other bad things that make the movie difficult to watch.  The best 3D you'll get is on the DVD box-art and I mean that.

I did not own a copy of the movie until this purchase, so I lucked out and the studio didn't double-dip on me.  The good news is that you do get two copies of the movie in the package:  one 3D version (that requires red-blue glasses, 4 are included in the package) and a wide-screen non-3D version.

2342578,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Well, it appears that this will be the first review of the Blu-ray, 3-D version of this movie on Amazon...I'm honored! I won't waste your time with yet another boring opinion of the story or characters themselves, as there are already hundreds of those on here for you to spend all day reading!  Along those lines, I will ONLY say that I personally love this movie and honestly believe it's the best, most realistic, and heartfelt use of animation technology that I've ever seen.  I'm over 50 and have seen most all of them by now.

ANYWAY, I am ONLY going to comment on my take of the 3-D video quality here, and leave the (great) audio quality to others, as my curiosity regarding the 3-D feature was why I upgraded from my perfectly good HD DVD copy.  I bought this edition yesterday (on release date) and watched the whole movie in 3-D last night, on our 60-inch Sony HD, 1080i, rear projection screen.  I put the supplied blue and red cardboard glasses over my regular eyeglasses.  Not super-comfortable, if you have an adult-sized head and need to wear normal eyeglasses.  You'll eventually get all of your eyewear lined up...what else could you do?!!  (I think you can buy sturdier, more comfortable ones online somewhere).

HERE IS THE GOOD:  I don't have much to compare this to (perhaps others do), except something I'll mention later, but YES, I was blown away by the almost constant use of the 3-D technology.  Snow seemed to be falling all over my home theater room (sometimes turning the whole room into a snow globe, if you catch my ""drift""...pun intended!!...sorry, I couldn't resist!)  Other objects, food, and hot chocolate flew or bounced around the train cars and past my head, front to rear!!  Just about everything, even when subtle, seemed to pop off (or extend in front of) the screen!  I think our 60-inch, large screen added to the desired effect, since I imagine that life-sized people and objects will seem more real, coming at or past you.  I don't think a much smaller screen would create quite as much of a dramatic effect, but I'd be curious to hear about that...maybe everything is proportionately equal that way?  So, the 3-D is very cool!  As I mentioned earlier, the only better 3-D effect I've ever seen (and I've never seen IMAX), was at Disney World (about 20 years ago!), when they were showing some sort of Michael Jackson island adventure short (""Captain...something or other!!""), made especially for that venue.  That one was absolutely AMAZING, when creatures actually ""flew"" off the screen and ""perched"" on top of nearby audience seats, then flew around the audience, taunting everybody!...No, I wasn't drinking!!!  And swords, knives, or spears were thrown at the audience from the screen, as well!  It was really a bit scary, actually, and I wasn't a little kid then either!  And just think, that was all those years ago, technologically speaking.  Who knows what can truly be done today?

ANYWAY, HERE IS THE BAD:  Even on Blu-ray (and I wouldn't suggest that you even bother with the standard def 3-D version because of this), you will lose about HALF of the clarity and I'd say about 2/3 of the color, compared with the 2-D version.  Everything looks almost, but not quite, Black & White, with a metallic-looking tint effect that often matches the colors on the supplied lenses.  Also, it even tells you somewhere to turn up your brighness and/or ""vivid"" setting on your screen, because the picture is noticeably DARKER than the regular version.  This gives an interesting eerie effect, but not really what most viewers (and their kids) would probably expect or want.

When you combine the drawbacks with the somewhat uncomfortable glasses (despite the ""cool"" Fifties-style fashion look!!!), I think you'll agree with my BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION:  It's a must-see for people who love this movie, as I do, just to experience it if nothing else.  BUT...my future viewings will mostly be in 2-D, with the beautiful Blu-ray picture quality, with its usual clarity, color, brightness, etc.  It will of course be a great ""Demo Disc"" to show off your system (again, preferably with a large screen if you want it to look real wintery in your house!!).

ALL IN ALL...a good addtion to your Blu-ray collection and a GREAT CONVERSATION PIECE!!!  PS:  My wife loved it, and she isn't the technology addict that I can sometimes be!  I hope this helps...Enjoy!",1225238400,6,4394,4.8133333333333335

2342580,1,B0009XRZ9M,"For those of us that fell in love with ""The Polar Express"" when it came out in 3D in theaters, this is the biggest slap in the face that Warner's could sell us.  I have been anticipating this home 3D version since it was announced and snatched it up only to have my excitement crushed when I discovered that the 3D was done with the old fashioned ""red/blue"" glasses and not the grey lenses currently in theaters.  Why would they do this?  First off, the dual color lenses ruins the color saturation of any film.  Second, the technology is out there!  With Blue Ray, HDTVs, DLP projectors and such, the replication of a true home multiplex is in our grasp.  The film has already been processed to use the grey lenses.  Why spend the money to reprocess the film into red and blue separation?  This makes no sense.  When I discovered this deception, I immediately opened the packages at the counter and promptly returned them.  (The same applies to ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"".  It has the colored lenses too.)  Do not waste your money on a sub-standard 3D experience.
UPDATE:  While I understand another reviewer's tale of the polarized light 3D, I don't believe that the ""Disney Digital 3D"" that I saw ""Monster House"" or the theaters that showed ""Beowulf"" or ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" bought special projectors just to feature these films.  My original IMAX experience used ""shutter"" type goggles that looked like diving gear and I could see that point.  But my last few experiences, from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" through ""Meet the Robinsons"", have been ""Blues Brothers"" type glasses that I was able to keep.  My belief is that the technology is out there and someone at the head office just thought this was cheaper to produce.",1225152000,3,1762,4.690553745928339

I love the process and am happy that more movies are getting duplicated in 3D for the big screen...and the little ones too.

2342585,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I didn't mind this movie for the first part and it does a great job of getting the storybook 'look', but I want to warn those who haven't seen it, that for a movie that continuously goes on and on about Christmas and BELIEVING and having FAITH, guess what? They DON'T actually mean that guy that was born a coupla thousand years ago!

I'm actually agnostic, but when I saw it I felt conned for a number of reasons. Yes, when people talk about lifeless CGI and ""the one with the zombie children"", they're talking about this one. Glassy, lifeless eyes, and disturbing movement (not because it was motion-captured, but because they motion captured adults in place of kids! Tom Hanks might be playing himself as a kid, but the certainty of movement and the body language is all wrong. And the eyes, my God the eyes... Second, the 3d was cool, but it's no better integrated into the story than a 50s novelty-3d flick. Watch it again and notice how obvious (in either 2d or 3d stereo versions) the ""comin' at ya"" bits are, and how they don't really further the story.

Finally, the whole ""faith' thing. Like I said, I'm not religious, but frankly I was aghast at the balls it took to hang the thing on belief and faith in regard to Christmas - but in regards to faith and belief in Santa, NOT Jesus! I guess everybody made a movie about X-mas, not Christ-mas. Whether you 'believe' in God or not, December 25th is a religious thing. It's pretty appalling. If they'd been straight up about it and hadn't danced around the consumerism angle, then fair enough. As it stands, I felt cheated. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if that was always the case. I give it 2 and a half stars (but I can't show half, so...).

SO that's my subjective view. I might have to watch it again, because I still can't really believe it. Ironic, eh?

An interesting tidbit is that when they released this movie, they showed pictures of Hanks acting, side by side with the final CG version. Why on Earth they thought that was a good move is beyond me, because it showed precisely how much life and expression was LOST in the transition! Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!

2342588,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Disclaimer:  This is really a preview of the movie, since I don't have the 3D blue-ray version in my possession at the time, but I definitely pre-ordered it!

[Disclaimer 2:  Okay, months after I ordered and watched this movie, I suppose I should update my preview into a real review, huh?  Stuff in Brackets are new info, for the sake of preservation of the original preview.  -MT 05/22/09]

For those who do not know, the Polar Express is based on a book by Caldecot Award winner Chris Van Allsburg of the same title (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express-Gift-Set/dp/0618477977/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express Gift Set</a>), a story told me about ten years ago.  Excellent book, btw, and you should consider buying it.

When the movie came out, it was released as a regular movie, and then as a IMAX 3D movie.  The regular movie was well-received, but the 3D movie was very excellently received.  I've seen both, and I can tell you that the moving train scenes and the falling snow scenes being seen in 3D is already enough to see the 3D version exclusively.  In my opinion, seeing the 3D version and then seeing the 2D version is like watching a movie in color, and then seeing it again in only black and white.  It did so well that the movie was shown in many IMAX theaters during Christmas for another 2 years.

Therefore, when the movie was first released in 2D only, I decided that I could not buy it, since to me, it was the stripped down version.  When I bought a PS3, I still did not buy the Blu-Ray version, since the higher resolution was an improvement, but without 3D, it still wasn't worth it.  Now, however, Warner Bros. is finally willing to release the movie in 3D and 3D Blu-Ray.

Therefore, you have 4 versions (plus the full screen version, but that's definitely not under consideration):
2D low def (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AGTPUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)</a>)
2D high def (Blu-Ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q7ZO8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express [Blu-ray</a>] and HD-DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express-HD-DVD/dp/B000I2JKCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express [HD DVD</a>])
3D low def (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q7ZO8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express [Blu-ray</a>])
3D high-def Blu-Ray (this version, although it's also released in HD-DVD)
If you have a Blu-Ray player, you really need to buy this one.  If you are unlucky and do not, get the 3D low-def version.  If you somehow have a HD-DVD player, you're out of luck, sorry.

Again, an excellent story, an excellent movie, and the 3D version is excellent.

Highly, highly recommended.

[updated 05/22/09:  While I still highly recommend this version, I now have to caution you about the 3D effect.  Don't know if it's because of me (I use glasses, and unlike the theater experience, fitting the paper frame 3D glasses in front of or behind my regular glasses isn't as good as fitting the theater 3D glasses over them), but the 3D effect wasn't great for me.  Because home 3D uses tinting as opposed to theater which uses polarized glasses, the 3D image is a lot darker.  For movies like Spy Kids 3D (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spy-Kids-3-D-Game-Over-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Series/dp/B0000TG9ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spy Kids 3-D Game Over (Two-Disc Collector's Series)</a>), this darkening isn't so noticeable, but in The Polar Express, because you see so much white snow, the 3D effect makes the snow off-white, with the colors occassionally turning greenish or reddish if either side of your glasses/eye dominates temporarily.  There are also enough night scenes that the darkening effect makes those scenes hard to make out, and you basically waste your blu-ray definition.

So, why do I still recommend this version?  Let's remember, this movie is still a great movie, still a great story, and the lack of technology makes this story relevant for years and decades to come.  And the resolution in the 2D version is still great, since it's still in blu-ray 1080P.  And the price difference between this one and the 2D blu-ray version is a buck or 2.  So, for this small difference in price, you get the option of 3D, without losing anything.  Yes, you can turn off 3D at the beginning, as well as swap between 2D and 3D in the middle of the movie.  And this will allow your kids (with presumably better eyesight), to experience the 3D version at least once.

Oh, and a person asked in the comments section if this includes 3D glasses.  Yes, 4 pairs, with the paper frames.

So, there you have it, my updated preview turned into an authentic review.  Perhaps with the imperfect 3D, I'll knock it down to 4.5 stars, so the rounded value remains 5 stars!  Yay!

The movie is a huge spectacle of wondrous imagery. All this surrounds the story of a skeptical young boy who takes a Christmas Eve ride on the Polar Express, in attempt to convince himself that Santa Claus is real. Tom Hanks is the star, providing the performance of several characters, including the stoic Conductor, who plays it strict in one instance, then endearing in the next. Much has been made of the liberties taken with the original story. This is just a case of having to stretch a simple story into feature length.

It was filmed in a special process whereby human beings are morphed into cartoon like animatronic beings and the background is partly real, partly imaginary. All of this helps to create the magic and fantasy especially for kids.
 Will all children who doubt that Santa Claus exists, but who aren't certain of their certainty, please get on the Polar Express train to test their beliefs? Step aboard with Tom Hanks as the conductor and take a wild ride on Christmas Eve to Santa's hometown. Full of action, very scary sequences, comedy, musical numbers, and a large measure of Christmas sentimentality and bathos, the flick roars along at a fast pace, keeping the kids, and the adults who are still kids at heart, on the edges of their seats. By virtue of computer graphics we see hoards of caribou and countless elves.
 The movie is full of magical effects. The train runs off its tracks and goes skidding across a frozen lake with the ice cracking and chasing it. Up in Santa land on the sound track some of the Christmas standbys are sung by the old timers which make it a nostalgic treat for the oldsters watching. This movie brings back a flood of memories and regrets. If only we could go back to the time when we believed.

I commented that it was like watching a movie with animation that had the same look and feel of photo's from childrens books. Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching ""Cars"" from Pixar. Polar Express may very well be a wonderful movie, and kids might enjoy it. But it just didn't do it for us.

There are lots of amazingly clever visual touches, e.g. the reindeer floating like Macy's balloons on their way to be harnessed to Santa's sleigh, and the montage following the lost ticket through the arctic wilderness was positively brilliant!

2342640,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I won't get into the details of the movie as there are plenty of others for you to read.

The idea is that a train takes children who do not believe in Santa Claus to the North Pole.

My son absolutely loves this movie and I admit that I enjoyed it when I watched it as well.

What I did not like, however, is the fact that the North Pole looks so industrial. It's not hard to imagine that hundreds of thousands (however many--there were a lot!) could build a toy for every kid that believed in Santa in one year. And the North Pole looked more like a large city than what I imagined as a kid.

For me, part of the magic of believing in Santa was that it seemed impossible. A smallish group of elves in a quaint little Christmas-like village making toys for all the boys and girls. The North Pole just seemed cold (no pun intended) and not very friendly in this movie. Also, Tom Hanks had quite an attitude and I really didn't care for that the second time I watched it either. I could also really do without his singing in the Hot Chocolate number.

Overall, it's great for kids, but honestly the way the North Pole is depicted in ""Elf"" and regular classics is the way I picture it and this just left a weird taste in my mouth.",1197504000,,1228,4.1645569620253164
2342641,3,B0009XRZ9M,"This frantically manic madcap would-be disaster epic was not what I expected or wanted The Polar Express to be, and was definitely not what it should have been. I'd go so far as to say this was not all that good of a movie, despite its novel animation and occasional visual brilliance. What frustrates me here is how great this movie could have been and should have been. There is only the slightest connection between this movie and the plot of the much better short book that goes by the same name. Also would it have killed the filmmakers to have stuck with the characters from the book as written and drawn instead of turning this beloved classic into some sort of misguided effort at furthering ""diversity"" in America? Just a very disappointing film from every aspect.",1197417600,2,773,4.649635036496351
2342642,5,B0009XRZ9M,"They are now showing this feature on The Family Channel, courtesy of your local cable company, so I doubt there are many people out there who haven't seen Polar Express at least once. To each his own.
You know, offhand, I think it would be very dreary if classic Christmas features began to resemble each other, or imitated each other, simply because there was an isolated working formula that pleased the mass audience. So I am really open to newness and fresh material, because great new features don't really take away from those beloved Christmas classics, but actually keeps the home fires burning.
So is with The Polar Express. I don't expect any Christmas fantasy or calamity to embrace all the possible angles of Christmas, but I do expect a heartfelt experiance.
Animation films are never required to be logical, and quite frankly, that is the extreme attractiveness of animation in the first place. You can get away with alot. If we demanded animation to be on the planes of logical procedures, Bugs Bunny would have been boiled in a stew in a heartbeat, but he always manages to get out of the most difficult situations, simply by kissing the most hardened foe. . . on the lips. THAT'S COMEDY! So I don't expect features like Polar Express to be entirely logical, just fairly to the point of speculation that IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS on Christmas Eve.
The premise of children even leaving there warm homes into the stone cold with just a bathrobe in itself defies reality comprehension. So as long as I'm in the comfort of my own home watching children baring the winter Christmas Eve cosmos in jamies, is their problem.
Now I admit, that having a lone man luring children on to an unknown midnight vehicle is a bit suspicious, especially without talk of consent from their parents to do so, it is a well known fact that Peter Pan himself has used this same sort of scheme with Michael, John, and Wendy.
What else is new?
For the most part, it is also likely this could have been somewhat of a dream, but like The Wizard Of Oz, it is supposedly not because unlike poor Dorothy who only had Toto as a living witness, our main childhood focus here has a bit of hardcore evidence.
My main concern is that throughout all the angles of what if, and why did it happen this way blah, blah, blah. . . I liked this movie. ALOT!
It's beautiful to look at like a 3D Christmas traditional card opening up it's telltale magic for all those who want to (yes I'll say it) ""Believe"".

So, yes, a lack of story telling tension, cliched, if you analyze it too much.  However, it IS a holiday movie, and the animation is exciting.  The dystopian industrial strength North Pole is unappealing, and a weak counterpart to the part of the movie where our heroes travel to the North Pole.  All in all, a lot of fun, with a weak ending.

2342654,1,B0009XRZ9M,"I just watched this with my kids last night.  I'm sorry, but I just can't square this Santa and North Pole with a standard like ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer.""  That place was full of love and humor, forgiveness and humility.  This Polar Express version is dark, authoritarian, and punative.  I also can't believe it earned a ""G"" rating with so much excessive danger and stressful suspense (train on the ice, Christmas star nearly killing an elf, etc) - my three-year old got scared and had to turn her head six times!  How awful!  (She kept coming back because her 6-year old brother was still watching.)

In ""Polar Express"" the conductor, Santa and the elves are humorless and of a ""law and order"" mentality that is prim and schoolmarmish - this is Christmas Eve, guys!  Loosen up!  And what is with Santa, anyway?  He clearly has a messianic complex that is fed by the uniformed cheers of thousands of sycophantic elves at the Nazi rally - er, midnight takeoff of the sleigh - when he makes his appearance.  And when Santa confronts the kid who picks up the lost reindeer bell, why so impolite?  Here he picks up the bell and then Santa appears out of nowhere and towers over him, the kid turns around and is obviously scared - c'mon, it's SANTA, people! - and what does Santa do?  No introductions, or ""Hello, I'm Santa, what's your name?""  He says, ""What did you say?"" in a very accusatory manner.  What a jerk!  But then, he runs a Bushian North Pole that has secret spy monitors on every kid alive, conveniently priming kids for a future with no privacy.  Imagine Soup Nazi mates with Santa (woah), and you have this guy.

So I give this 1 star because there IS some lip service to the real message of Christmas (what, it's not about just getting stuff?) and the graphics of the train (especially the hot chocolate sequence - that is actually excellent) are good in a Fritz Lang sort of way.  But if you want the spirit of Christmas, for God's sake get another movie.",1195862400,7,1976,4.531073446327683

2342693,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Better than average movie with adventure and the usual theme of believe-in-the-magic-of-Christmas. The adventure does have scary moments.

This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times. It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.

One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.

If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.

One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude. As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc. I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance. I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining. But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.",1171238400,2,1615,4.926470588235294

Tom Hanks as the conductor has a bit of a mean streak that I didn't like, I was expecting ""good cheer"" at Christmas.  I think the anxiety and disbelief comes out very well in the boy lead (also played by Tom Hanks I think).  He has been lied to far too often and he no longer believes luckily for him in his world Santa is still real wheras in ours the original Saint Nick is long dead.

The music score is wonderful and the characters are so very life like - It's an old fashioned story produced with modern technological innovations.

2342758,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I'm not a huge fan of this movie - let's get that out of the way up front. I think the book was original and charming and the movie was simply over the top, a techno orgasm. Furthermore, I don't care for this type of animation. Why would animation want to try to look deceivingly real? I don't get it. I enjoy animation that revels in its absurdity rather than trying to fool the audience or make them gasp with amazement at how realistic it looks. Lastly, call me old fashioned, but I'm a fan of the tv specials of the 60s that celebrated Christmas, and they are the measurement of joyful holiday viewing I hold all other movies, specials, etc. up against.
Imagine how surprised I was when I showed this in my kindergarten class today and the children were mesmerized! You must understand (those of you who work with youngsters can attest), having two dozen kids sit quietly for over ninety minutes is nothing short of miraculous. No matter how popular or entertaining the choice is, there are always a handful who get squirrely and start chatting or bothering their classmates, and soon the viewing devolves into a battle to keep the room quiet for those who want to continue watching. And yet, today the room was quiet and engaged!
It struck me that perhaps this was a new tradition that had been born. This movie, despite my misgivings, has managed to perform the kind of seasonal magic that so many films strive for and so many never achieve. The children were getting the message, thrilled with the wild ride, and, sorry for the heavy handed cliche, but BELIEVING! Amazing. They may never know the Rankin-Bass delight of cheesy stop-action puppetry, the hilarious dance scenes of the Peanuts gang, or the sinister glory of Chuck Jones' Grinch, but damn if they haven't found their own Christmas classic to revel in for those years they chose to believe. One day they may try to foist this on their children and come away with the same sadness and disillusion that I had when my kids (mine and the school children) yawn during Rudolph, but hopefully they'll learn the same lesson I did. Merry Christmas!",1166486400,5,2108,4.63903743315508
2342759,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Tom Hanks dominates this lively, warm, and sweet animated feature, based on the 1985 Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name by Chris  Van Allsburg.
  We travel to a home in a snow-filled suburb of Michigan one Christmas Eve, where a young boy on the verge of adolescence lies in bed, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh bells. His parents (voiced by Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis) check on him and his sister, Sarah (Leslie Zemeckis/Ashly Holloway). But as logic, reasoning, and concrete proof are becoming more essential to the young lad, he has reason to doubt that he will hear the bells; his World Book Encyclopedias tell him the North Pole is a barren wasteland where life cannot be sustained, therefore, no place for Santa to have a toy facory. He has a newspaper story about striking department store Santas, and a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, ""The Discovery"", featuring a child discovering his father's Santa Claus suit.
  Soon enough, there is a mysterious rumbling outside his house. Clad only in his pajamas, robe, and slippers, our Hero Boy wanders out into the snow to investigate. In so doing, he is confronted by an enormous train called The Polar Express, and a conductor urging him to get on.
  Reluctantly, he does so, and as a smiling snowman waves in the distance, he is off.
  He encounters a group of children in one of the cars, clad only in nightclothes like himself despite the cold. Another little boy(voiced by Peter Scolari) is hesitant to get on, and almost misses the train. Once aboard, he remains by himself in a dark box car.
 The Hero Boy becomes better acquainted with his fellow passengers. The most prominent of these are the Know-It-All (voiced by the Eternal Nerd, Eddie Deezen, who is very much in his element), and  the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), the latter of whom expresses a motherly concern for the Lonely Boy, whose name we learn is Billy.
  The children are entertained by the waiters who treat them to an amusing performance while serving hot chocolate.
 During the heart of the journey, the children engage in various acts of kindness and civility towards each other, and the Lonely Boy is made to feel more and more included. At one point, a train ticket goes astray and has an interesting journey of its own.
 The conductor, Hero Boy and Hero Girl deal with goofy engineers (voiced by the late Michael Jeter, to whom the film is lovingly dedicated), and a dangerous jaunt down an exteremely steep slope.
  The Hero Boy has periodic encounters with  a mysterious Hobo(also voiced by Hanks) who confronts him about his lack of faith in Santa, but does help him save a life.
 The conductor comes up with an unorthodox way of getting a herd of caribou blocking the train out of the way, and the Hero Boy and Hero Girl view a car filled with damaged toys and are exposed to the concept of recycling.
  In the meantime, the Lonely Boy watches the night and begins to sing a wistful carol which becomes more hopeful-sounding when the Hero Girl joins in. Soon, the four main characters are treated to a viewing of the Northern Lights as they approach their destination.
 The Christmas City is lively and full of light. The children are surrounded by a multitude of elves, and the three children on whom the story focuses break away from the others after disembarking.
 Amid an array of Christmas carols from the 1940s and '50s (in marvelous counterpoint to Alan Silvestri's glorious score), the three observe the inner workings of Santa's toy factory, watching the elves as they monitor the behavior of children all over the world.
  Traveling in a tube-like vehicle, as they saw the elves do, they find their way to a conveyer belt where Billy finds a gift with his name and address. But soon the children and  the gift are dumped into the bag on Santa's sleigh. The Know-It-All is found among the packages as well.
  To the strains of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"", sung by a young Frank Sinatra, Santa Claus appears, and the crowd of elves and children go wild with delight.
  From his position in the crowd, the Hero Boy cannot see Santa. A bell  falls off of the sleigh's reindeer harness and the Hero Boy picks it up, listening for the jingle and trying to believe with all his might. Of all the children in attendance, Santa selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas before taking off to deliver the gifts.
 Watch for a fun cameo by Steve Tyler as an Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer!
 Soon, the children are homeward bound, and the conductor punches a special message of either praise or suggestions for improvement into each of their tickets.
  The Hero Boy discovers the harness bell missing, and he is as disappointed about that as Billy was about relinquishing his gift to an elf.
  But the magic that both felt had slipped away, is indeed reclaimed on Christmas Day--a theme touched upon the the film's beautiful closing anthem, warmly and soronously sung by Josh Grobin.
  While the story focuses on the magic and myths of Christmastime, the Hero Boy and his family are presumably going to attend a church service that day. We learn that as he gets older, the Hero Boy gradually becomes the only one who can hear the sleigh bell.
 I wish those on Amazon a fond Christmas 2006, and may we always enjoy the sweetness of the sleigh bells!",1166486400,3,5317,4.650963597430406
2342760,5,B0009XRZ9M,"What an outstanding movie - especially when you consider the making of it.  Tom Hanks is the base for several characters and the annimation is splendid.  I had just seen the movie this year and the purchase of our own copy was a must!  Our 3 yr old loves the movie and in no way found it frightening (though I can see how it could be frightening if you have the surround sound cranked up and a 150"" t.v. placed 5 feet in front of the child).  A family movie that offers magic, suspense, excitement and joy.  Loved it.  Just loved it.",1166486400,3,533,4.176470588235294
2342761,4,B0009XRZ9M,"It seems like every time I let controversy over a movie keep me from seeing it in the theater that I regret it.  Such was the case with this movie.  I heard a lot of criticism over this movie and I let it keep me from seeing it in the theater.  How dumb was I?  This movie is a lot of fun and a feast for your eyes.  Modern film makers make few enough of these films, and this one is a winner.

We meet a boy who is at that age where he begins to realize that the world appears not to have as many mysteries as he believed it did when he was little.  One of those mysteries is Santa Claus.  He truly wants to believe, but the evidence he has gathered tells him that there is no Santa Claus.

As he falls asleep on Christmas Eve he hears a most unlikely sound: a train pulled by a steam engine outside his house.  He quickly runs outside to see a very real train making all sorts of hissing and ticking noises.  Then he sees and hears a conductor yelling ""All aboard!""  The boy does not get on the train in spite of the conductor's best efforts to convince him to board.  As the train pulls away the boy changes his mind and barely makes it aboard for a journey to the North Pole!

We soon meet several characters who will be keys to the plot of the movie throughout.  Tom Hanks plays no less than five characters:  the boy's father, the conductor, the boy himself, Santa Claus, and a hobo ghost.  I could tell it was Hanks easily enough with three of the characters, but the other two did not sound like Hanks at all, though I watched an interview with Hanks and I can tell you that it definitely was Hanks.

This movie is filled with subtleties and a lot of fun.  I would rather allow you to watch the movie and discover the treats for yourself.  To tantalize you a little, the train does get to the North Pole, but only after running out of control and nearly sinking under water.  Even after the train gets to the North Pole our heroes end up taking a detour on one of the train cars, ending up somewhere in the heart of an operations center.  Even though I knew this movie was animated, the scene where three children cross a trestle over what appears to be a nearly bottomless pit was a bit tense.

This movie is a visual treat throughout, but the visual effects from the point the train appears are spectacular.  The train is extremely detailed as are the animals, plants and people.  The animation is unusual when compared with animation we have seen in the past because of the type of computer animation used.  However, the results are phenomenal.  While the animation did distract me a lot sometimes, after having watched this movie umpteen times (for those who like this message, this movie can be addictive) I can tell you that I keep coming back for the message and not the graphics.

This movie was nominated for a bunch of awards, including three Oscars, but it only won four.  I found it interesting that this movie won a Grammy Award for Best Song for a Motion Picture, and yet the Oscar people failed to recognize this movie for any sound awards, though the Oscar people nominated it for several sound awards.

I believe that for many people the ""Polar Express"" will be a holiday favorite and tradition along with the Rankin/Bass classics, ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and ""A Christmas Story.""  If you have yet to see this one and you enjoy holiday stories, definitely give this one a try with an open mind and an open heart.

Enjoy!",1166313600,15,3446,4.31104199066874
2342762,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie is bound to be a holiday classic!!! I was totally blown away watching this movie.

You can't get anything in life if you don't believe in what you want, so ""believe"". Not knowing anything about this movie before I watched it except that it is a christmas movie, I was totally suprised that it didn't have this ""religious"" statement attached to it.

2342763,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Mark Blackburn's review is undoubtedly deserving to be the first one to be read. It was more than the adult's perspective, but to be able to have multiple perspectives with a young child next to him.

I was transfixed by the graphics and artistry of this movie. With this type of animation, the simplest of movements -especially human- is often taken for granted. Not so in this film: non-verbal communication was beautifully expressed. A transformation occurred as I found myself wondering ""where the feeling of childhood belief in the unknown"" had gone.

It was the character of the young black girl that transcended (albeit quite naturally) adult expectations and stereotypes. I so enjoyed watching her, listening to her young girl wisdom (which, with all the speaking children, you have to imagine what their lives were like with their families), and natural leadership. Every time she was asked ""Are you sure?"", the quizzical look seemed so much like inward doubt -until the last time she's asked the question and there's no hesitation in her response of ""Yes.""

As beautiful and timely as this movie is, I do have a concern that bothers me, and will bother other children. At the end, there is resolution for the two young boys. Both of them are seen getting off the train, going to their homes, and receiving gifts which were proof of their journey. The young black girl is left on the train. There is no ""ending"" for her. The train goes on -pretty much into the cosmos of thinking and belief- and she disappears along with it. This is disturbing, and unfortunately, not uncommon. There is an aspect of ""redemption"" clearly felt and wanted for all three characters (remember that they were not with the whole group of children when the train arrived at the North Pole; they were separated; one child loses the ticket of the young girl, and is full of doubt about the existence of Santa; the other young boy finds his present but doesn't want to let it go in exchange for saving his own life). Two of the three children are shown receiving forgiveness and redemption; the young girl is blatantly OMITTED at the end of the movie. There is no question of what happens to her, the home she lives in, the family that she has -nothing. She didn't die before the end of the movie. She should not have been conveniently ""dropped off"" the screen and ""out of the mind"" of moviegoers.

I still love the movie. Her character is poignant, tender, confident, and every bit the young girl she's supposed to be; and certainly lives on in my mind far beyond the cars of The Polar Express.",1166313600,,2578,4.696902654867257
2342764,4,B0009XRZ9M,"This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times.  It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.

One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.

If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.

One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude.  As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc.  I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance.  I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining.  But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.",1166140800,,1481,4.803149606299213

Finally, while channel chasing one evening, I caught up with this movie and found myself so totally absorbed with the story and the wonder of it that I was actively breathing a sigh of relief when the train made it over the frozen water, and gasping with wonder at the artists' take of Santa's City (so *that's* how they load Santa's sleigh).

The idea to use motion-capture animation just added to the mystique and feel of the movie as well. It is amazing how realistic the movie looks; the characters do not look animated at all, in my view. The story is timeless too-a young boy (who is only called ""Hero-Boy"" in the film) who has lost his faith in Christmas boards a mysterious train, The Polar Express, where the Conductor (voiced by Tom Hanks) is desperately trying to get back to the North Pole before Santa makes his run. He meets ""Hero-Girl,"" an African-American about his same age, a young boy named Billy (also known as ""Lonely-Boy"") and ""Know-It-All,"" a somewhat too smart for his own good young boy. The journey has many twists and turns to the North Pole, including a meeting with a mysterious Hobo (also voiced by Hanks). All of the children have a ""Golden Ticket"" with letters punched onto them (the significance of this is revealed by the end of the movie). The boy meets Santa at the North Pole, although does not believe in him at first. I will not give away too much more, but this is a true Holiday Classic which deserves to be in every DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie.",1165622400,3,1378,4.628571428571429
2342781,3,B0009XRZ9M,"As a book, the Polar Express is a modern Christmas classic.  I was both ecstactic and sceptical to hear it would be turned into a feature film.  Picture books don't tend to translate well to feature length films (See Jumanji, Cat in the Hat, the Grinch).  Yet the team behind this guaranteed that care would be given to the treatment of the material.

Care is given to the material.  The world of the film is true to the world of the book.  Attention is given to little things such as being able to see the wolves from the train.  The theme is that of innocence, and if you're looking for a film that encapsulates innocence, look no further.  Zemekis and crew do a fantastic job of illustrating the innocence of children at Chrismastime.  This film has a lot of spirit going for it.  And by far, it is the most innocent, 100% kid friendly movie I've seen in recent memory.

The filmmakers take some liberties.  Notably in adding some conflict, such as difficulties in reaching the North Pole, creating some side characters, and adding more depth to the North Pole that is featured ever so briefly in the book.  The best addition is easily the homeless man who appears only to the Hero boy on top of the train.  The worst has to be some awkward decisions about the North Pole.  Sorry, but the ultra futuristic look and Santa's rainbow whip kinda turned me off.

Then there is the design.  This movie looks specatacular - in 3D.  And if you see this in Imax 3D, it is a breathtaking experience.  However, on DVD the 3D experience is not there to reveal the film's many shortcomings.  For one, ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" of the 3D experience are replaced with the filmmakers attempts to stretch the story into a 100 minute feature.  Furthermore, the supposedly groundbreaking ""acting"" in the film makes the people's movements seem awkward.  While the actual character designs are fine (though I would probably reconsider some of the facial expressions in the film), the movements do not allow you to suspend yourself in disbelief.  The final blow is the film's music.  The score is fine, which seems to recall Silversti's own Back to the Future, while also recalling another winter based score, Danny Elfman's score to Edward Scissorhands.  Sadly, the same can't be said for the film's songs, which lack the immediacy and poignancy of Disney's animated features.

Overall, the Polar Express is a great family film that fares better on the big screen than on the small one.  On the small screen, the story moves slowly and the visuals don't come to life nearly as well as they do on the huge Imax screen.  Zemekis and all involved capture the innocence of the book perfectly, but can't stretch the theme of the story to keep us sustained for 100 minutes.  Catch it at the Imax in 3D or read the book.  As a stand alone film at home, it may be a snoozer.",1165190400,6,2839,4.575396825396825

2342795,2,B0009XRZ9M,"I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:

First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say ""That's not in the book...that's not in the book...""

Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.

I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...

A kid chasing a ticket through a train,

A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,

A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,

(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)

OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...

A train sliding out of control on the ice,

A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,

A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the ""coaster tycoon"" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.

Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...

A train car running out of control through Santa's village,

Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...

Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.

At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!

And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.

So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a ""character driven"" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.

I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.",1163894400,14,2889,4.412878787878788

2342798,5,B0009XRZ9M,"THE POLAR EXPRESS is an archtypal story of doubt, discovery, and belief.  The tale of the boy who doubted the existence of Santa Claus stands out as one of the better holiday offerings.  Picked up in front of his house by a magic train on Christmas Eve, the boy experiences a thrill-a-minute journey to the North Pole where he gets to meet Santa and learn how powerful belief is.

Based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, who also gave us the books JUMANJI and ZATHURA which were later turned into successful movies, THE POLAR EXPRESS was given vibrant life by Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.  Like SHREK, the book was only 32 pages, but somehow had enough story content and a world big enough to sustain a feature-length movie.

THE POLAR EXPRESS is going to be shown around the holidays for years to come.  I grew up with the stop-motion television shows about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman and thought those movies would never be topped.  Of course, back then I had no clue that even Walt Disney's magical studios could pull off a cartoon movie (in this case, though, computer-generated) so well done.  Tom Hanks's portrayal of the Conductor is spot-on, and he does several other voices as well, including that of Santa Claus.

One of the best things about the movie is the beginning journey, when the Boy is exploring the train and meeting the people aboard it.  The hobo/snow ghost is amazing.  The out-of-control train sliding across the ice, then trying desperately to escape ahead of the breaking ice, is a real nail-biter.  The visual effects are stunning and beautiful to look at.

If you haven't seen THE POLAR EXPRESS, you're in for a treat.  This HD DVD edition puts all of the special features at your fingertips on one disc.",1161734400,4,1760,4.672077922077922

So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.  What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as ""Do you believe in Ghosts?""  The ""lighter"" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.

2342800,2,B0009XRZ9M,"Chris Van Alsberg's beloved Christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent, outrageously overblown animated film. The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his home
on the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.

Hopefully, with this wonderful film now available along with the original book, no other child will grow to adulthood without taking a ride on The Polar Express.  It's a wonderful story about the spirit of Christmas and the importance of giving.  The incredible animation of the film may always be the first thing people speak of, but in the end it really does come down to the story.  It is not what you see, it's what you feel - these are the memories that will linger.

The digital animation that brings this story to visual life is nothing short of astounding. This revolutionary ""performance capture"" technology makes these characters the most life-like animated characters I've ever seen.  I think they look more human than actual humans, truth be told - except for Santa.  It's a weird thing about this Santa Claus; he immediately reminded me of none other than Harry Potter's Professor Snape (even though Santa's voice was actually that of Tom Hanks).  I've heard that some kids found the whole visual look of the characters rather creepy, but I think the uncanny technology really makes the film come alive.  By incorporating the motions of live actors into the digital creative process, filmmakers were able to imbue their creations with the nuances of human expression, and one can hardly underestimate just how much that adds to the viewer's experience of the animated story.  It's really quite incredible.  Traditional animation would hardly have done this story justice, and it would have been incredibly challenging to film such a magical journey in the traditional manner.  This film has some of the most unique and exciting camera angles and perspectives I've ever seen.

It's hard to see how anyone, child or adult, could not enjoy this movie.  It's an incredible journey, filled with both excitement and comedy, to the North Pole, for Pete's sake.  There are also moments of great warmth and emotion - most of them supplied by the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye).  Tom Hanks may steal the show in his performance of five different roles, including the Hero Boy at the center of things, but the Hero Girl - who befriends a forlorn little boy (Peter Scolari) who shies away from everyone else - is the heart and soul of this film.

I chuckled when I read the editorial review because I also thought of Nuremberg when I saw the masses of elves rallying around Santa before his Christmas Eve departure.  Clearly, though, there is nothing but joy and kindness in this mass assembly of people - er, elves.  I loved this movie.  Unless you're a grinch or a Scrooge, just watching it will take you back to your own days of childhood and the magic that Christmas once brought.

The characters were awful: A goody-two-shoes girl, a boy who is determined not to have fun, and a dumb boy who doesn't believe in Santa even if he is surrounded by elves. The movie is boring. The only exciting bits are motion simulators, and the bits that try to be funny just aren't. With all the computer animation these days, you'd think that they'd make a GOOD story to go along with the visuals.
It's all just chit chat about nothing, and two songs that are just flat out weird. I do not recommend this to anyone who hasn't read the book, because you won't want to read it after this movie.
The time of the movie is entirely taken up by a really boring and depressing train ride. It seemse like the creators wanted the movie to be long enough, so the filled it in with junky parts.

The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.

It isn't just the great visuals and audio; the story is extremely entertaining all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling.

Mr. Randy Thom reminds us in this one that great sound design must be ""simple"" and yet absolutely emotional. The animation and acting were pretty good.

In some parts it felt just a bit ""rollercoasty"", but as I said, it's great. Kids'll love it and will also learn some beautiful teachings from the movie.",1142640000,,563,4.3619047619047615

2342847,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Santa Claus is a tough sell. You can't cause him too much peril, because, ... well, because he's Santa Claus. In ""The Polar Express"", the only conflict that exits is the threat of losing your belief, in Santa Claus. Adults may add their own metaphor. No evil plot to conquer The North Pole, no reindeer catastrophe, no elves picketing for better working conditions, no, this is serious Santa. What we all understand about the famous, ""Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus"", newspaper editorial, (it's always been my cynical belief that a brilliant editor made up the letter), is laid out here in bloated bubble-gum fashion. Somehow wallowed in the sentiments and styles of the first half of the 20th Century, the film is about a magical train to The North Pole, and if nothing else, they got the transport right, sometimes the train ride to Santa Land is as redundant as a train ride to Buffalo.

""The Polar Express"" is filmed with animated real actors, apparently playing opposite a 'blue screen', and then swallowed up by it, like that dreadful Aha! video from decades ago, and the effect is like a more mature, thoughtful Gumby, or a decrepit Davy and Goliath, (it was a clay-motion religious children's show in the early '60's, and those who have seen it will never be the same.) Great care is given to detail the facial psychological grimaces of the boy who hops aboard The Polar Express, to see for himself if Santa is real, but the 'extra' kids on the train, seem ridiculously unable to react or interplay with the few speaking characters with dialogue, like if they spoke, the producers would have to pay them imaginary scale, or the animators would have to move their mouths. When a magical train ticket, (nothing is left un-magic-ized), is lost out the window of the train to the wind, the film uses exquisite filming technique to record its journey up mountains, down rivers, free-falling and swirling in snow squalls, and it is a very nice, worthless to the story, bit of Fantasia. Likewise, the boxcar tramp who appears to the boy in times of peril, like a cowboy from heaven, is a nice touch, but the idea, like the tramp, disappears in a puff of smoke.

The final North Pole Christmas climax extravaganza, looked to me, given its 1940's heart, like a horrific German youth for Hitler rally, with thousands of elves dominating the city, (mean mothers, too), like a Karl Marx industrial nightmare, and what seemed an entire civilization vowing allegiance to dictator Santa.

Suffice to say, ""The Polar Express"" doesn't compare to the humblest Christmas pageants, say, TV's ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"", which seems to have the same earnest warm Christmas thoughts in mind, and accomplishes the sentiment that The Polar Express, all lights flashing, and whistles blowing, roars through.

It has become a Christmas tradition for my family to see this film at the IMAX theater in 3-D (Highly Recommended). My little boy, however, was taken to a newer level with this film when I purchased this special gift set and let Santa deliver it to him on Christmas morning! He absolutely loved getting the movie, but what was indeed the icing on the cake was having the snow globe and wood train added to the DVD. Even after Christmas season was over and the movie was put away until next year, the snow globe and train remain by his bedside and he always looks at it before he goes to bed.

This gift set is just what Santa should be getting for all little boys and girls who are not only facinated with this movie but have a love for trains in general. If there could have been an improvement done for next year, it would be to replace either the snow globe or train with an actual replica of the silver bell that was on Santa's sleigh.

The Polar Express is one of those feel good films that Disney use to do long ago and someone needed to do it. This  simple story about a special train taking a group of children to the North Pole to meet Santa before magical ride.

The roto-scope process of  animation gives this holiday video such a magical feel especially in the widescreen process. You can see why the film was on the IMAX screen.  This Half human/half cartoon-ish effect gives this film like a timeless classic. The effects are stunning, the cinematic ride is stunning and overwhelming in  visual department and amazing in its scope and range.

Tom Hanks dons many verbal character hats in this production, including  the all knowing conductor and SANTA.

There is simple message that flows in this film, that makes this film morer than a Christmas favorite. Disney use to have that, but not anymore-its that simple charm with no pretention nor preachiness.  It  should be shown with your favorite Christmas holiday classics  like White Christmas, Holiday Inn How the Grinch that Stole Christmas (cartoon not film),Frosty the Snowman, An American Christmas Carol (with Henry Winkler),  Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Die Hard (well everyone has a guilty holiday pleasure)

And I confess I was impressed -- mostly -- with how well the film carried out the art and action of the book. It's not a ""straight"" animation, in that it uses 3D motion-capture techniques to give the characters lifelike movements. Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job voicing the conductor and Santa and all the other adult males, even if he can't sing worth a damn.

2342890,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Christmas time is here.  It's a time of Joy and maybe even a little pain.  It's that special time every year I give the cynic in me a little time off.  It's also the time I let myself get pulled into the movies of the season.  I'm not talking about the fodder for Oscar that permeate this time, or the stupid little comedies created to play off these high class art.  I'm talking about those movies about Christmas, the really engage and audience.  Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, A CHRISTMAS STORY, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, or MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS.  Films that on the surface are a little schmaltzy and silly, but have so much heart I can't stand to be pulled in.

THE POLAR EXPRESS follows the adventure of a young boy whom has lost his faith in Santa.  He muses the question any growing boy would ask ""Does Santa exist?""  When a mysterious train appears on his front lawn on Christmas Eve it whisks him away on an adventure that could take him to meet the big man himself.  Was it a dream? Does Santa really exist?  All these question will be answered in 90 minutes

Christmas has a new movie: THE POLAR EXPRESS.  A film so sweet, and breathtaking it's hard as a critic to shower it with negatives.  Of course I could... I could tell you there are moments when the films momentum screeches to a halt, the ending goes on forever, and the tone of the movie is a little to sweet for its own good.  I also thought the needless cameo by Steven Tyler completely dragged me out of the film.

""Oh look it's the guy from Areosmith,"" I mused. It took me out of the film for a moment because I thought I was in a much cheaper film.  But I will not acknowledge those small trifles anymore.

This film is breathtaking.  It's one fueled entirely by imagination.  The new computer imaging effects do a great job of conveying a magical aura, without drawing us into reality.  I don't believe we'll ever get to the point where a computer generated person will look human, (and that's just fine with me.)  Had the creator's of the Polar Express tried to do that it would have destroyed the look of the film.  But the characters odd movements, and almost human emotions strike the right chords.

I loved the dancing chef's And waiter's sequence on THE POLAR EXPRESS.  It was silly and  so full of life.  I wondered if they had tried to shoot this film in live action (without green screens and body suits) what would this sequence look like.  My thought: Bad Broadway.  But the CGI characters could fly through the air, do difficult physical stunts and all without the scene feeling choppy.  This is the first big sequence and it sets you up for the even more amazing wonders to come.

The Polar Express also takes us on an adventure in speed over and icy lake, down the steepest hill imaginable, and introduces us to characters that are both vibrant and fun.  Tom Hanks fills at least 5 roles, and gives each one their own aura.  I especially loved the vagrant Hurdy Gurdy man whom appears and disappears to help out the young hero.  The scene on ski's... I really don't want to ruin it for you.

THE POLAR EXPRESS is high art aimed at a young audience.  If you have a heart of stone, I wouldn't recommend you waste your money here.  But if you like to be whisked away to far off lands, if you have a place in your heart for Christmas, give THE POLAR EXPRESS a try.  It's so much fun.",1138233600,3,3378,4.352564102564102

It's about a young child who is skeptical about Christmas (Santa Claus) as a whole and discovers faith, the true faith, that truly lyes within. He decides to get on a ""North-Bound"" train and also discovers other kids who are also riding with him, as they all become companions, and the adventure to the North Pole begins.

However a word of caution: I would not recommend this picture to young viewers unless you've had a chance to see it yourself. The first half of the movie is INTENSE, and full of big heart-stopping action. (I won't give it away).

Having said that, many of the things that are crammed into this movie are well done.  The music is great, especially the duet between the African-American girl and the boy from the other side of the tracks.  The roller coaster effects were great, I wish I could have seen this in the theater--it would be really cool on IMAX.

2342910,5,B0009XRZ9M,"As a child, it was family tradition in my home that my mother would read The Polar Express to my sister and I while we drank hot chocolate.  The sweetness of the timeless story and the fantastic pictures captivated us year after year.  So, clearly the short story by Chris Van Allsburg holds a very special place in my heart.  Naturally, I was very excited when I heard they were going to produce a fully computer-animated movie based on this classic.

We open the film with a young boy who is having trouble falling asleep on Christmas Eve.  As he gets out of his bed and rummages through various magazine ads with various depictions of Santa Claus, we quickly see that he is skeptical about the idea of Santa's existence.  Shortly after he goes back to bed and falls asleep, he awakens to a thundering sound and he sees a large train stopped in front of his home.  He is rightfully bewildered since there aren't any train tracks in front of his home.....

He goes outside and is met by a conductor who invites him to get on the train, which is headed for the North Pole.  After turning down the offer, he struggles with himself and finally decides to get on the train as it is moving away from the house.  The rest of the story is filled with lots of suspense and action (as most of the film is set on the train), friendship, hope, and faith.  Will the boy regain his faith in the spirit of Christmas?  I will allow you to discover this answer for yourself and I'm sure that you won't be dissappointed if you do.

In seeing the movie, I was truly amazed with the careful job they did in translating the story to the silver screen.  Being such a short story, they had to add so much to make it into a full length movie.  Much of what they added were suspenseful action scenes - which are very welcome and not too intense for younger viewers.  There is also a lot of added humor and relationship established between several of the children on the train.  The interaction between the children is truly where the heart of the movie is and it truly shines a light into the viewer's heart.

The visuals in this film are breathtaking!  The computer generated snow-capped mountains, icy lakes, birds, wolves, and caribou are truly a joy to look at.  Also, the author's inventive vision of the North Pole is beautifully realized and is truly amazing to witness.  The score is equally fantastic, subtly complimenting the visuals and adding greatly to each scene.  One theme in particular is present throughout that is particularly beautiful and effective.

Altogther, this adaptation is very well done.  Every picture from the book is used in the film (as there were only a dozen or so) and they gave me a sense of nostalgia.  Most importantly, the gentle, mysterious spirit of Christmas and the power of faith - both so evident the book - are captured perfectly here.  The result is a truly fine film for all ages that will surely become a Christmas classic for many generations to come.",1136937600,3,2980,4.513059701492537

2342913,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, it's something of a mystery why The Polar Express did not connect with audiences when it was released in theatres last year. Perhaps people weren't ready to accept that kind of animation yet - at least not until it looks a bit more realistic. Regardless, Robert Zemeckis' film certainly has all the right ingredients for a classic children's Christmas movie: a timeless message, dazzling visuals, exciting action sequences and universal characters that anyone can relate to.

The film contains some of the most impressive computer animation this side of Pixar except that it is not done in a caricature style but rendered as realistically as possible, much like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. However, despite the state-of-the-art CGI, the facial expressions of the characters aren't quite as fully or realistically animated as in hand-drawn animation. They aren't able to accurately render wrinkles on a person's face. They still look too smooth and waxy with the hair looking rather plastic-like. However, the rendering of shadows and light, like a shot of the train stopped by the side of the road, the warm light of its interiors casting shadows on the snow covered ground while flakes of snow fall gently from the sky, looks very impressive indeed. Each scene is elaborately rendered with so much detail that you could pause any frame and spend a good amount of time marveling at all the work that went into this movie.

The first disc features a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with ""You Look Familiar,"" a featurette on the many faces of Tom Hanks. He ended up playing five different characters and worked entirely on blue screen sets while wearing a motion capture suit and very little props or other actors to interact with.

""A Genuine Ticket to Ride"" explores, briefly, the source material and how the filmmakers were able to adapt it through digital technology known as performance capture. This featurette takes us through the technical aspects of the filmmaking process in easy to understand terms.

""The Inspirations: An Author's Adventure"" takes a look at author Chris Van Allsburg. He got his start as a sculptor but moved on to drawings when it became too expensive to buy supplies.

""Josh Groban at the Greek"" is a music video of the singer performing ""Believe"" at the famous venue interspersed with clips from the movie.

""Behind the Scenes of `Believe'"" takes a look at how the song came together and what it meant to those involved - clearly it was a labour of love.

""Polar Express Challenge"" is a game that has you steer the train across the frozen lake to safety and then you have to help Santa deliver presents to deserving children and coal to the bad ones.

""Meet the Snow Angels"" features key cast and crew members talking about their warmest memories of Christmas and the best gift they ever got.

Finally, there is an ""Additional Song"", a deleted scene between Smokey and Steamer that was actor Michael Jeter's last musical performance before he died.",1136246400,4,3059,4.899419729206963

2342929,1,B0009XRZ9M,"SPOILER WARNING!

This is one of the most depressing Christmas stories I've ever seen.  I am not a better man for having watched it.  Next year, I'll skip it.

I don't mean anything against the intention.  You can have a great secular kids Christmas story (Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, The Year Without a Santa Claus, Santa Claus is Coming to Town among many others) unless you start toying with the ""real"" meaning of Christmas.  Take a secular Christmas story and throw in ideas of what we should believe and you are bound to miss the mark.  But this movie is not without its high points.

The best thing about the movie is the song ""When Christmas Comes to Town.""  That just may be a classic.  Time will tell.

The artistry is spectacular but only in still shots.  The animation is robotic and mechanical.  Characters in ""A Bugs Life"" and ""Toy Story"" moved far more naturally.  You believed those characters were real.  In ""The Polar Express"" I could never get past the fact that the characters consisted of nothing but logic gates and software.  I had forgotten the picture came out only last year so I was surprised to find a 2004 copyright in the credits.  Given the inferior animation, I thought the movie was 5 or 6 years old.

But now we get to the meat of the matter--the story.  Robert Zemeckis seems to be trying to please as many people as possible by offending as few of them as possible (I never read the book but I hope it has more substance).  I could look past the bad acting via the C++ code if there was some substance to the story but ultimately it left me empty.  This is Christmas we're talking about!  Not ""Political Correctness for Dummies!""

Three main characters are kids right around that age when they stop believing in Santa.  It isn't clear up front but later on we learn that the main character is the only one who truly doubts Santa.  The Lonely Boy character believes but is alienated.  He is possibly the most tragic character in the movie.  Christmas ""just doesn't seem to work out"" for him.  He is sad and poor and maybe a little bitter.  It's clear Christmas doesn't work out for him because he doesn't get much--if anything--for Christmas.  He wants something specific and always asks Santa for it but never gets it (he is certainly NOT spoiled, just poor).  The main character and the girl convince him to not give up hope and in the end he gets the material possession he always wanted.  His salvation is not in love but in stuff.  In the end, the commercialization of Christmas is his savior.  This left me feeling terribly empty.  No talk of family, friends, forgiveness, perhaps even something bigger than Santa--things that have profound TRUE meaning around Christmas.  He got his trinket and his soul was filled.  How sad!

The Hero/girl made decisions and got the group out of a few tight jams.  Great.  She deserves praise.  But when I think of the age old question, ""What does Christmas mean to me?"" The answer, ""Leadership"" never comes to mind.

And now the main character.  He doubts Santa.  He doesn't really believe anymore.  He's not in first grade anymore.  He's at the cusp.  He is growing up and needs to decide.  To believe or not to believe.

Believe in what?  Magic?  Santa?  Something more?  Something spiritual?  Christmas Spirit (whatever that means in this vanilla-plain-offend-no-one movie)?  In the end, he believes. . .in Santa.  Okay.  Fine.  Development is arrested for the time being.  hoo-ray.  Empty.

This movie didn't make me want to be a kid again.  It reminded me of my own doubts at that age and brought no satisfactory resolution.

I really wanted to like Polar Express.  But one of the more dreadful scenes involved the conductor saying, ""What's important is to decide to get on the train, not where it's going."" (huh? What kind of message is that?)  And then there's the hobo riding on top of the train splatting as the train speeds into a tunnel (this is still a kids Christmas story, right?)

The most enjoyable part of the movie was during what Amazon.com calls ""The Nuremberg-like rally of frantic elves.""  This is when Santa makes his grand entrance.  A door opens.  His shadow is cast hundreds of feet in front of him across the sea of elves.  He is truly bigger than life.  You can't see him yet, only his gigantic shadow.  By that time, I was so disenchanted by the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said, ""Maybe that's Godzilla and he'll jump out and torch the whole place.""  We laughed our butts off.

That would have been an appropriate ending.",1135641600,16,4539,4.603513174404015
2342930,1,B0009XRZ9M,"Admittedly, the movie is pretty to look at.  The music is OK, even though it frequently becomes faux Lloyd Webber, and he is faux enough all by himself.  What I find objectionable is the theme:  constantly the movie hammers in a theme of ""believe"" as a good thing, when what the world needs now is more people who question.  Mere ""belief"" leads to suicide bombers and airplane hijackers and is responsible for most of what is wrong in our world today.  Toward the end of the film the conductor says ""What's important is to decide to get on the train, no matter where it's going.""

This is a movie that for adults and children who are in that awkward stage of wondering if they believe or not, can rekindle the spirit of Christmas. (NOTE: The children are not named except for the poorest child who is Billy.) There are some touching and wonderful moments such as when the very together black girl saves hot chocolate for the poor white child, Billy, who is sitting in the rear train car all alone; when the main character confesses that he stopped the train to allow Billy to get on when he fell; when the main character confesses to losing the black girl's ticket and tries to make it right; when Billy and the black girl join in a lovely, heart wrenching duet about Christmas coming to town; when the main child finally can 'hear' the sleigh bells on Santa's sleigh; when Billy realizes he has a gift and when he is returned to a home that now has a tree and a wreath on the door.

The basic moral of the story is that if you believe in something you're doing good. The difficulty I have with that is it's not necessarily true (terrorists believe in ""something""). There's alot of talk in the movie about belief, and implications of faith, but at the same time it takes particular precautions to stay on the politically correct side of the Christmas fence. Nothing about the birth of Jesus is mentioned, and even the selection of Christmas tunes avoid any connection to the birth of Christ (e.g. Santa Claus in Coming to Town, O'Christmas Tree, Chestnuts Roasting on a Open Fire, etc.). I will grant that part of the American Holiday called ""Christmas"" includes a mythical character called Santa Claus, but it's also about a real person called Jesus Christ, and many more Americans believe that, than a minority of Americans would like to believe. There is nothing magical about the idea of Santa Claus, as the movie suggests. The Santa Claus part of Christmas is connected to lights, and decorations, and Christmas trees, and shopping, and commercialism, and getting gifts, and ultimately promotes greed and stress. The Jesus Christ part of Christmas, and the whole story surrounding that, is the source of Christmas charity and giving, and ultimately promotes goodwill toward others, and faith in something that can really make a difference in a person's life.

The central theme of the movie, which is aimed towards children, is that if you have ""faith"" in something, you can hear and see things with which non-believers will not notice.  This is largely true:  notice the crying spells in our nation's (the United States') churches:  certainly non-believers could not relate or understand the crying spells.  The believers do -- and that is what differentiates the two.  The believers believe, and thus, see, things that others do not have.

I had read the book--if ""read"" is the right word for a book with no plot.  It was pretty and aimless, and I wondered how they could make a movie out of it.

They did it by stuffing it with miles of howling rollercoaster scenes, some not-very-magic magic characters, and more howling rollercoaster scenes.

Half the characters are voiced by Tom Hanks; the other half are voiced by Tom Hanks talking through a handkerchief.

A boatload of money was spent on this.  The computer animation is dazzling and whizbang--but never ceases to be dull.

The main reason for the dullness is the lack of charm of the characters.  They are often sentimental, but never truly warm.  And the computer-animation gives them a waxy, corpse-like look.

They all look like underdone refugees from a Tim Burton movie.

I wondered if children might like it, so I asked a friend who teaches 5-year-olds.  She had read them the book, which they liked, and asked those who had seen the movie if they like that too.  They didn't.  They said it was dull.

2342961,5,B0009XRZ9M,"""The Polar Express"" is an animated film based on Chris Van Allsburg's children's Christmas book. The book is only 29 pages long, and this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, so additional material has been extrapolated from Van Allsburg's story. It tells the tale of a young boy who is beginning to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, flying reindeers, and Christmas magic. He awakes in the middle of the night before Christmas to find that a train, the Polar Express bound for the North Pole, has stopped in front of his house. The conductor persuades the boy to climb aboard, and it's off to the North Pole to see Santa Claus give out the First Gift of Christmas and begin his whirlwind journey to deliver gifts to all the world's children. But not before the boy has some adventures on board the train with the other children passengers.

In making ""The Polar Express"", director Robert Zemeckis wanted to recreate the style of Chris Van Allburg's oil painting that illustrate the book. He needed a method of animating the film that could do that, yet convey subtlety and realism in performances from the actors. Zemeckis used a motion capture system designed by Ken Ralston at Sony Pictures Imageworks, which they called ""Performance Capture"". The actors are filmed wearing form-fitting ""mo-cap"" suits studded with reflective markers, which are also applied to their faces, so their body language and expressions can be used as a blueprint for the animation. The amazing thing about this is that the actors' performances are preserved even when their appearance is altered dramatically by the animators. Tom Hanks plays 5 roles in the film, including the little boy protagonist! The little boy looks nothing like Hanks, and yet Hanks was able to physically act the role. Adult actors Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen also play children. They were filmed against sets 160% normal size to get the scale right for their young characters. Michael Jeter plays both the train engineer and its fireman, one of whom is fat and one skinny.

The results of the animation are truly impressive. ""The Polar Express"" looks like an oil painting come to life. There are some really beautiful scenes. And the characters seem so much like live action characters that I was a little perplexed while I watched it. I thought this must be a live action film shot against a green screen and digitally animated, but I wondered how that was possible with a cast of child actors. Reading about the film afterwards solved the mystery. That must have been some shoot with everyone wearing leotards and Tom Hanks often playing 2 characters in the same scene! In any case, ""The Polar Express"" is one of the better Christmas movies I've seen, digital effects aside. Adults will enjoy some laugh-out-loud moments and entrancing scenery as well as children. It's bound to become a Christmas classic.",1134777600,6,2876,4.879345603271983

The digital animation makes the already empty, souless charactors look even more creepy. The same guy does voices for at least three different main charactors. The producers shouldn't have been so cheap and actually payed some actual human beings to do the extra voices or, even better, play the roles themselves.

2342981,4,B0009XRZ9M,"""The Polar Express"" was fairly popular last year, although not entirely liked by critics. Watching the film it was kind of obvious to me why critics weren't completely fond of it, but I do think that visually this movie was awesome and while they could have improved the plot a little bit, I felt the film worked. The movie is based on a thirty page story book, so the fact that they were able to expand it to a 100 minute movie is cool; But you don't really know any of the characters names, so forgive me for the un-detailed synopsis.

A young boy who doesn't believe in Santa wakes up one night to find a very large locomotive parked outside his house. A conductor (played by Tom Hanks) informs him that it's The Polar Express which will take him to the North Pole to meet Santa. The boy decides to get on the Polar Express and meets a number of colorful (and nameless) characters, one kid I found particularly annoying. He also meets a fairly creepy hobo (played by Tom Hanks) and eventually meets Santa (played by Tom Hanks) and there's a big elf-rock show at the end of the film (the frontman played by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler). As I said, it's a visual wonder...The characters look very real, except for the eyes which creeped me out. They're very glassy, almost dead looking. It's no Christmas classic, but it's a good movie.

2342982,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Okay, so it's ""too scary"" (as some have put it) for small children. Fine and dandy. Not every movie, or even every Christmas movie is meant for all ages. I myself have a five year old daughter and she wasn't crazy about the film, but of course there are lots of other Christmas programs that she and other kids her age enjoy. I watched The Polar Express alone and I wondered if I'd be wasting my time. I'm happy to say I didn't and I categorically endorse this instant classic.

I won't talk about the plot much, since this is a film that should be enjoyed visually, but it centers around a boy that has grown disillusioned with Christmas and the whole notion of a character named Santa Claus. As he lay in bed on Christmas eve, a mysterious train stops by with the conductor urging him to get aboard. He does and soon meets a young girl that he befriends, as well as a boy who seems more down-on-his-luck and lonely than anyone else on the train. From there, it's all one wild ride to the North Pole, through a toy factory, and finally to meet Santa Claus himself. There's also a mysterious hobo who lives on top of the train. Is he really there, or isn't he?

There are several moments of sheer excitement, including one extended sequence involving the journey of a lost ticket, a roller coaster ride (so to speak) on the train down a steep incline, and a scene inside the toy factory.  Moreover, this is a great looking film with intense situations, characters to care about, and a subject that is dear to many of us: Christmas.",1134000000,6,1531,4.402826855123675
2342983,3,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie would still be complete in my eyes if the inner third of it were taken out. The beginning of the movie and the last half hour of the movie completely capture the heart, spirit, beauty and story of the book. In between that, there are a lot of contrived moments of tension that take away from the story and make it less believable because they are way too dramatic, and also they showed kids several times in seeming danger of imminent death. There were several roller-coaster simulations that were obviously put in just to be titillating. And I had trouble believing that Santa would have so many inept people working for him as to let the train go out of control or almost get swallowed in a frozen lake, and also things that happen in Santa's town itself, like the star on the tree getting knocked off and almost killing an elf, and part of the train breaking away and careening through the town with 3 kids aboard. I mean, come on!! How many problems can there truly be on one train ride? The storywriters managed to cover all the possibilities, I think.

Maybe kids really get a kick out of these 'action' sequences, but they seem like they belong to a different movie. And I think they could very easily scare younger kids. It seems to me like they were added just to ensure that this would be a full-length movie that could generate more cash than a 40-minute TV special would. I agree too with another reviewer who noticed that the train conductor was pretty harsh - which wasn't really the fault of Hanks' acting but rather the script.

So, my recommendation is to watch just the first and last parts of this movie. Watch the first part through the wonderful hot chocolate serving scene, and then skip ahead until the kids are standing in the middle of the North Pole main square waiting for Santa to arrive, and watch it from that point on till the end. Those are the scenes that are mainly taken from the book, and those are the scenes that moved me and made me feel that it was a film worth watching.

I gave it an extra star for the visuals, which were stunning. The human/elf characters seemed Play-doh like, but I got used to that, and everything else was visually breathtaking.",1133913600,8,2203,4.475124378109452

""Polar Express"" is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  In order to give the film a true ""storybook"" look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds.  The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.

The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa.  One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter.  Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.

On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy.  Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement.  Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.

The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it.  However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters.  Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting.  Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back.  Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas.  On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it.  And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.

""Polar Express"" may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons.",1133654400,6,2452,5.059701492537314
2342999,4,B0009XRZ9M,"My husband rented this movie for our 3 yr. old daughter who is just starting to not be scared of Santa and loves trains.  She is a bit young to understand that ""hero boy"" is doubtful of Santa's existance, she loved the ""Hot Chocolate"" song, and seemed spellbound by the traveling ticket (ticket comes out of the train, follows wolves, gets eaten by a bird, and ends up back on the train).  Yes, this does have themes for older kids to understand but also has fun for little ones as well. She did not find this movie scary -  though portions of Pooh's Heffalump and Madagascar had her on edge. In fact, she has asked to watch this movie repeatedly so I  know we will be purchasing our own copy.

The reason for the 4, rather than 5 stars, has to do with the animation. Although overall the animation is excellent, the eyes of the characters seem a bit creepy to me - I am guessing this is a limitation of the technology rather than a flaw of the animators - regardless, they do seem somewhat souless. For that reason, I knock it down 1 star to 4 stars.

Other than that, I think the actors were very good - yes, you can tell Tom Hanks plays multiple characters but so what? I thought the story was compelling. And the music blended seemlessly with the storyline. This will be in our holiday movie rotation for years to come!",1133654400,8,1323,4.314516129032258
2343000,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Director Robert Zemeckis' films have always used the latest in technology to bring a new way of approaching special effects. The process of animating toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit without the grain from earlier attempts worked beautifully while Forrest Gump used old archival footage and matched it with recently shot footage and you literally can't tell the difference. Using the book of the same name for inspiration, he brings in a new technology(or let's say a revamped one) that while it does have the visuals, it lacks what should be in a Christmas film: heart.

Hero Boy(I'm literally not making this up, that's how he's credited) is starting to not believe in Christmas. So the titular train stops by picking up other kids who don't and takes them all the way to the North Pole. It's a weird concept personally: rather than let the kids just not believe, it's like ""alright kid get on and we'll prove to you Santa exists"". The entire trip takes up the bulk of the film as they go through mini-adventures before reaching the North Pole.

First thing I have to say before I start listing complaints is the visuals: holy crap these look awesome. This film is literally reference quality if you want to test your new TV. The train is quite detailed, the colors, the landscape all has topnotch quality written on it. I'm going to mention the actual characters next because that's where it falters.

One common complaint in reviews was the way the characters looked, especially the eyes. They look rather lifeless and without a soul, as if you were staring into a doll. When the Jolly Fat Man shows up, to me he literally looked like a mannequin. Also mouth movements looked incredibly strange to me. The idea of using ""performance capture"" it's the same as motion capture but also capturing the faces is a relatively new technology(the same technique was emplored to bring Gollum to life in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) but the execution is still off.

Another complaint I personally have is the padding of the length. It's literally a 45 minute film stretched out twice the size, you can notice scenes just seem to be put in to expand the length(such as a rather lame hot chocolate song). Also hearing Tom Hanks' recognizable voice coming out of no more than 5(!) characters takes you out of the film a bit. He does an excellent job with Santa though, the only time I couldn't tell it was him.

Now the ever important question: since it's designed to be a holiday film does it work. In a way. Kids will love it. It's got the magic and splendor that Christmas should have although they might find it a bit too suspenseful, especially when the train starts to speed up. Buy it for the kids but as an adult watching it, the flaws will be easily detectable.",1133568000,5,2762,4.628571428571429
2343001,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Me and the wife just finished ""The Polar Express"" and we both thought the same thing, that this was one of the most beautifully made movies the two of us have ever seen. I am a Christmas fanatic, and this ranks right up there with some of the all time classics. Why not 5 stars you may ask? Well, simple, as you know, I rarely give 5 stars to any movie or game, and the only Christmas movie I would ever give 5 stars to is 'It's a wonderfull life', answer your question? good, moving on......

Tom Hanks does the voices for 5 characters I believe, and he does them pretty well, but you can tell its him in all of them, so thats not so good, but besides that minimal flaw and very few others this CGI miracle is amazing. Now, I am not a huge fan of CG, in fact, I find it ruins alot of decent movies, but not in Polar Express. The CG is breath-taking, the snowstorm is astonishing and the train itself is a wonder to behold. The colors are bright when need be, and quiet and deep in the more emotinal scenes. The 3 main child characters are all delightfull, the only exception being a loud, obnoxious, nerdy kid along for the ride who didn't really fit and was not necessary. If they needed comic relief in the form of a sidekick why not have a dog or even a cat along for the ride, that is always a good fit, especially in a Christmas movie.

Another one of my slight flaws is that the expressions on most of the characters don't change much, but it's really not a big deal cuz' you are too busy ooing and awing over every brilliant scene or location. Not only is the train a spectacle but once they arrive at the North Pole, it gets even better. The imagination that went into this is one-of-a-kind. I don't think we are going to see another movie as visually stunning as this in quite a long time.

Is this the best CG movie I have ever seen? pretty close race, but I'd give the edge to Nemo, so it gets a strong 2nd place, It's better then both Toy Story's (both are amazing 4 star movies) and a little better then Ice Age or Monsters, Inc. I know there is more of them, but they are mostly 3 stars and below.

I do strongly recommend this for any child and there family, I can't wait to watch it again, but I'm going to hold off on buying it.....The special features are suprisingly lacking, no behind the scenes, deleted scenes, bloopers, or anything, so I thinking the re-release will be packed, until next time, take care all.

acting..........4 stars, Hanks is solid as usual

directing........4.5 stars, Zemecki's vision is amazing

special effects.....5 stars, CG at it's best, no equal.....yet

The movie includes all the scenes from the book and adds quite a few characters, events, and action sequences to the story.  Even with these additions to the story the theme is still the same as the original story in the book.  The story is somewhat darker than the traditional Christmas specials and movies marketed for children.  The story takes place late at night and because the children in the story are put in life threatening situations this movie may scare young children more than it entertains them.

Though the story itself is somewhat thin, the animation is brilliant.  Never has animation seemed so lifelike, with loving detail to character movements and gorgeous alpine scenics.  Tom Hanks lends his brilliant vocal characterizations and physical appearance to several roles, most notably the conductor and the mysterious hobo.  He is of course also the embodiment if not the voice of the hero boy.  The movie's message is clear:  if you believe, then everything is magically possible.  The trip to the North Pole is fraught with misadventures and once there, the magic of the landscape and the North Pole is breathtakingly captured.  Alan Silvestri contributes a fine score even if the BELIEVE song is a little maudlin, but deemed Oscar worthy as performed by Josh Groban.  Nona Gaye also does nice work as the hero girl and Eddie Deezen is a great know it all.  In time, I think this groundbreaking joy will be a Christmas classic.

2343021,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I do not believe that there are any books that are so sacred that they should not be made into a movie.  But I did have some reservations about bringing Chris Van Allsburg's delightful picture book ""The Polar Express"" to the big screen as a computer animated film for two reasons.  The first is that half the charm of the original are Van Allsburg's exquisite pencil drawings.  I knew there would be something lost in the transformation from black & white to color.  The second is that the other half of the story's charm comes from the simple story it tells and unlike the massive amount of cuts that had to be made to bring ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" to the screen"" writer-director Roger Zemeckis had to add a whole lot to the original story.  This risks losing the simple message in all the dancing waiters and train rides across the ice.  What I would have loved to have seen would be a half-hour television special, shown without commercial interruption, where CGI is used to preserve the look of the original (to wit, this generation's version of ""The Snowman"").

That being said, this version of ""The Polar Express"" is delightful in its own way even if you do not find it to be as magical as the book.  The story is of a young boy who has reached the age of doubt, where he is about to decided that Santa Claus is not real.  That is when the Polar Express arrives at his door and he discovers he has a ticket in his pocket (not the pocket with the hole in it but the other one), a magical train that will take him to the North Pole to find out the truth for himself (when the train appears out of a cloud of steam and snow is the point in the film that best captures the spirit of the book).  The train is filled with other children and there are minor adventures to be had, both on the journey and when they arrive at their wonderful destination.  Tom Hanks lends his voice and ethos to not only the Conductor, but also the Father, the Hero Boy, the Hobo, Scrooge and Santa, which essentially makes him as much the narrator of the tale as several of the characters.  That is important because there really is a sense here of a story being told that is a key part of the dynamic.  Like most Christmas messages, this is one that has to be passed along each year so that people remember it and keep it in their hearts.

I have no problem believing as a general rule of thumb that anybody who has not read the book would have no problems adding another star to their rating for this 2004 film.  The computer animation is pretty good and this will undoubtedly becoming a favorite for both the young and the young at heart.  Final note: I am coming to terms with the fact that you have to wait about a year for Christmas movies to come out on DVD.  Certainly this is the time of year to want to watch and buy such things, but it always seems strange to think that I was interested in seeing this movie a year ago.  Then again, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" was actually released on May 2, 1947, so go figure (but that is the official movie of Thanksgiving, even with Santa as a pivotal character).",1133308800,3,3105,4.287671232876712

2343034,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I became entranced with Chris Van Allsburg's book The Polar Express while working in a bookstore during college. For those who don't know, Allsburg is also the author of Jumanji and Zathura, both of which have been brought to the big screen.

My 7 year old son has been a train fanatic for years, so when we heard that The Polar Express being made into a movie, we were thrilled! My husband, son, and I went to the theater to see the movie and absolutely loved it.

The animation is unique (I've not seen anything quite like it and we own a LOT of CGI/animated DVD's!), the colors are vibrant, and the story is both whimsical and meaningful. I especially like the idea that each child had partial words punched into their tickets--indecipherable until they learned a particular lesson while on the journey to the North Pole.

The songs are beautiful as is the soundtrack. ""Hot Chocolate"" is a rousing song sung by waiters who transformed an ordinary traincar into a magical ""cafe"" for the delicious treat.

Unfortunately, there are NO extras on the single Disc DVD save the theatrical trailer. Scene Selection is available as is choosing English, Spanish, or French--either spoken or in the form of subtitles.

After watching the entire DVD twice (my husband just bought it 4 hours ago!), my son is now watching it for the third time--now in Spanish. What surprises me is that the Spanish actors sound very, very similar to the ones in the original. Even the whiny, nasally know-it-all keeps his chracteristic voice!

If you don't mind the lack of extras, the single Disc version will do just fine. It's available in wide screen and full screen. My only complaint--and this is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5--is that it had NO insert in the front cover. No pamphlet, no booklet, no coupons--nothing! I can't remember a time where I've gotten a family-oriented DVD and it not have a booklet on the inside!

Retaining the mystery and the magic, The Polar Express is an excellent film in the spirit of Van Allsburg's book. It will be well-loved by train enthusiasts, kids-at-heart, and those who believe.",1133222400,4,2109,4.730245231607629
2343035,5,B0009XRZ9M,"(This is an updated version of an earlier review.)

  ""The Polar Express"" is a beguiling holiday-season fantasy, something that ought to be part of Christmas for decades to come. Adapted and expanded from a children's book by the gifted writer/illustrator Chris Van Allsburg, it combines the work of one of our best-loved actors with some innovative animation techniques, all under the command of celebrated director Robert Zemeckis.

  When Tom Hanks first read ""The Polar Express"" to his own children, he bought the screen rights- two decades ago. Using some great voices and an unusual method called ""motion capture"", he's a half-dozen different characters: the stentorian train conductor, the ghostly hobo, a stern Santa, a cackling Scrooge puppet, a quiet dad and (with some help from ""Spy Kid"" Daryl Sabara) the modest ""Hero Boy"", whisked out of his snowbound, heartland home for a wondrous train ride.

  This very Jewish writer doesn't necessarily believe in Christmas or Santa Claus, but ""Polar Express"" is enough to convert anyone. The journey includes some stunning, painter-like tableaux: a dramatic caribou crossing; a chilling ride over the polar ice cap; a roller-coaster passage down glaciers. All this leads to one of the most arresting animated sets you'll ever see: this North Pole is no Alpine chalet but a solid red-brick city of gigantic toy factories, resembling a cross between St. Peter's and an antique New England mill town.

  The other kids on the train: a good-natured ""Hero Girl"";

a nerdy ""Know-It-All Kid"" and a withdrawn ""Lonely Boy"". Together, they not only bond on the ride north but in a runaway train car at the North Pole. They look like figures from a painting come to life. It all leads to the kind of classic holiday lesson that all can appreciate- inspiring without a hint of schmaltz. A humorous aside that I loved: the Grand Central-

style dispatch center, run by a crew of elf officers with wacky Brooklyn/Jersey Jewish accents right out of '50s-style New York TV sitcoms.

  The best extra shows how Hanks did his multi-role work; as ""Conductor Tom"", he wears a black unitard with what look like polka-dots on his face. These are tiny light sensors that transpose Tom's own movements and expressions into shadows for the animated character(s). We also meet Van Allsburg, a self-taught artist/sculptor with many other celebrated books- and movies (""Jumanji"", ""Zathura"")- to his credit. Pop-opera balladeer Josh Groban and composer Alan Silvestri also appear; the latter, Zemeckis' musical collaborator ever since ""Back To The Future"", did both the soft, subtle score and several songs- including the bizarre, big band-ish ""Hot Chocolate"" number, done by Hanks and a chorus line of dancing waiters with huge cocoa vats. Even an array of holiday standards you've heard ten million times- Como, Crosby, and- classy!- Sinatra to back Santa's grand entrance- sound both quaint and brand new as the kids make their way through the North Pole toy factories.

  ""Polar Express"" is to the Christmas season what ""The Wizard of Oz"" is to musical fantasies of old. If you have a chance to see the IMAX edition next December, don't miss it. Meanwhile, you can enjoy the proverbial ""Christmas in July""- or whenever- with this enchanting tale.",1133222400,,3275,5.085981308411215
2343036,2,B0009XRZ9M,I really didn't like this movie.  I wish I didn't buy it because I doubt if I will ever watch it again.  The movie seemed long and boring.  Almost an hour on the train seemed like forever.  There are better films out there.,1133136000,4,223,4.116279069767442
2343037,4,B0009XRZ9M,"I found this movie to be a wonderful delight.  Tom Hanks did a wonderful job in the several different characters he played in this animation story of a child who has stopped believing in Santa Claus.  Besides the wonderful animation, which is a must see, the story begins with a young boy who has stopped believing in Santa Claus, and in an attempt to restore the boys belief in Santa Claus, A Train arrives at the boys house, (The Polar Express), and takes the boy on a magical train ride where the fun and magic begins.
Eventually after a long journey through the wilderness, and across many glaciers the train arrives at the North Pole only to find out that not even one minute has passed, which also makes the film a little more magical and mysterious.
But I think what really pulled this film together for me, and made it a wonderful delight to see, was how Santa sought out the one boy who had lost all belief in him, and gave him a present (a sleigh bell) which could only be heard by those who believe in Santa, and restored the hope and belief of a young boy.
I rate this film four stars, because of the wonderful animation, and the storyline.  A must see Family Film, which is safe for children of all ages.",1133136000,3,1217,4.352422907488987

2343040,5,B0009XRZ9M,This is an enjoyable tale capturing the spirit of Christmas that can be enjoyed by all of the family.  It is appropriate even for small children to watch.  We have watched it with our grandchildren when they visit at Christmas time and they love it!,1133136000,3,249,4.511111111111111
2343041,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The delightful award-winning book ""The Polar Express"" has been turned into one of the most delightful films I've ever seen. I have since read many reviews that make me glad I watched the film before reading the reviews: some of the delight comes from being surprised by events in the film that wouldn't be a surprise if I had read them first.

This film looks like nothing I've ever seen.  The combination of ""motion-capture"" acting and animation results in a look that is much more ""real"" looking than traditional (or even Pixar) animation, but much more stylized than simple live-action filming.  For this story - it's a perfect marriage of ""story"" and ""look"".

To avoid spoiling the ""surprises"" I'll only encapsulate the first few moments.  A boy is at that age when the existence of Santa Claus is very much in question.  After all - Santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light with a bag of toys larger than an ocean liner to cover his appointed rounds.  He lies awake on Christmas Eve, waiting to hear a sound a friend has told him he will never hear - the sound of sleighbells on Santa's sleigh.

The movie begins weaving it's magic spell from the opening seconds.  Although it's a stylized animation, it gets the most minute details exactly ""right"".  This is a film that knows how new-fallen snow crunches under your feet.  It knows how a kid will check the milk and cookies left for Santa for evidence of whether or not the jolly old gent has come by.  It knows how a kid will fake being asleep when the parents come in to check on you when you're SUPPOSED to be asleep.  It's a movie that knows what it is to question, and what it means to have faith.  Another thing this movie understands is that at the North Pole - Santa is a really big thing.  It's one thing to meet Santa at your local mall, but if you were going to meet him at the North Pole, wouldn't that be just a little bit bigger?

As our hero boy lies awake in bed the whole house suddenly rumbles as if an earthquake were in progress.  He rushes outside to find a huge gleaming train.  The conductor (looking an awful lot like Tom Hanks - Mr. Hanks provides voice to six characters) calls out and asks the boy if he's going to get on board.  The boy asks where the train is going.

""Why, the North Pole, of course!  This is the Polar Express!""

The conductor sizes up the boy and astutely observes that the boy is at that time when he begins to not believe.  ""If I were you, I'd get on board"", he advises the boy.

This is a movie that understands the transition from believing to questioning, and it understands the importance of not giving up the faith.

If I were you - I'd watch this movie.  And be prepared for it to become one of your favorites.",1133136000,10,2736,4.347140039447732
2343042,3,B0009XRZ9M,I am a huge fan of christmas movies and found this one enjoyable. The film aims moor to the younger age but anyone can also enjoy the film. The film gets you right in the christmas mood and features some good chritmas songs. The best thing about the film is the animation it's great the only bad animation was santa I felt like he looked the least real of all the charactors. The story is slow at the begging and dosent get really good till the middle. But again it's a good christmas movie to get you in a festive mood.,1133049600,2,520,4.158415841584159
2343063,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I'm probably a little late coming in on this. I did not see Polar Express when it came out in theaters. I offered to take my children, and they weren't interested for some reason. We first saw it when we watched it at home after our Thanksgiving meal. What a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season. I was planning to turn it on for the kids and then leave the room, but I was hooked right away and we were all mesmerized throughout the movie. It is beautiful, exciting and touching all at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I fell in love with this movie. It really is in a league of it's own for Christmas movies. The music is also wonderful. I have purchased the soundtrack and it will become a Christmas classic along with the movie. I NEVER cry at a movie, but if you don't get misty-eyed during 'When Christmas Comes to Town' or 'Believe' then you have to be made of stone. No one will regret having this in their collection to pull out every year and re-live the magic. I think we will probably watch it every Thanksgiving night to kick off the season from now on. Usually when I purchase a DVD, I think long and hard about how often I will really watch it and if it will be worth the cost. I didn't think twice about this one. I am very proud to own this DVD and know it will bring many, many years of joy.",1133049600,,1341,4.14176245210728
2343064,4,B0009XRZ9M,"Believing in the spirit of Christmas becomes a challenge for a young boy in the charming movie ""The Polar Express"" based on Chris Van Allburg's children's book. On Christmas Eve the boy is invited to ride a train to the North Pole by the conductor (Tom Hanks) and a chance to discover the his power to believe in  Christmas once and for all.

Although audiences initially gave ""Express"" a chilly reception the film actually more than broke even at the box office due to repeat visits from fans of the film and a vaunted IMAX presentation. While there have been complaints that the motion capture technology used here (a familiar technique used less extensively in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""I, Robot"" and ""King Kong"") giving the characters a creepy look, I found the film to be perfectly charming and no less inviting than watching any other CGI movie. While it's clear that this technique is still in its infancy (or, perhaps, in the toddler phase at this point), director Zemeckis makes good use of the technique to render characters that are believable and amazing background for the film.  ""The Polar Express"" is guaranteed to be a perennial at Christmas time. Tom Hanks essays a number of roles in the film which is something that could have been done without CGI (think of Peter Sellers and all the characters he played in ""Dr. Strangelove"" or Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies) but the use of CGI makes the transformation into other characters a bit more believable visually.

""Express"" looks quite good on DVD. We don't see any analog artifacts (not a surprise given that it was shot digitally and rendered in a computer) nor do we see edge enhancement or other digital artifacts I've come to expect from movies shot either on film. Again, this isn't a surprise given the fact that this was transferred directly from the digital files to DVD. The colors on the train are warm and inviting while those set outside in the chilly, snow filled night has just the right frosty edge to them. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track sounds marvelous with crisp, clear dialogue and nice use of the surround format. The rear speakers get considerable workout with ambience and the rattle filled ride on the train enveloping us in the world of the film.

The release of single and double disc movies is becoming more of a trend. It's clear that studios recognize that there are those who watch only the movie and have begun tailoring their DVD releases more and more for different segments of the audience. The single disc edition has just the movie and a trailer (unless you purchased the single disc edition at Best Buy--it comes with a mini-DVD that features footage from ""You Look Familiar"" one of the extras on the two disc edition).

On the two disc edition you get a whole lot of extras some of which are interesting but hardly essential. ""You Look Familiar"" focuses on the performances of Tom Hanks and others in their multiple roles and the use of performance capture to enhance their acting for the film. We see footage of the live performance capture work show with the scene from the film which is a nice before and after comparison.

""Genuine Ticket to Ride"" features five featurettes after an introduction. ""Performance Capture"", ""Virtual Camera"", ""Hair and Wardrobe"", ""Creating the North Pole"" and ""Music"". At under 12 minutes it can't possible offer the depth that filmmakers might want. Nevertheless you'll learn a thing or two about the production and the obstacles, challenges and triumphs that faced the film crew.

""Josh Groban at the Greek"" features the popular singer performing the song ""Believe"" as well as a featurette on the creation of the song. ""Meet the Snow Angels"" Share the memories of cast and crew about their favorite Christmas. ""Polar Express Challenge"" provides an interactive game. It's not bad but kids will only want to play once or twice and forget about it once the novelty wears off. There's also a number of bonus clips throughout the second disc that are called ""Stocking Stuffers"" to be discovered for those who wisely use their remote control.

Surprisingly Warner chose not to provide much detail or in depth background on the production of the film and its CGI rendering techniques. That's too bad. While this kid friendly approach will certainly be appreciated by the film's core audience, adults like to be entertained and informed as well. Perhaps we'll see something more adult orientated in the ""Special Special Edition"" that will no doubt come out just in time for the Holidays next year.

""The Polar Express"" charms with its delightful performances, groundbreaking use of CGI and ""performance capture"". While the extras could have been more comprehensive and more filling, they aren't bad. I'd suggest sticking to the single disc edition since the movie is the real highlight and the second disc probably won't be watched more than once (if that). Zemeckis has done a terrific job translating this children's story to the screen although it does have the feeling that it is padded a bit. I'd recommend the single disc edition vs. the two disc as I didn't feel the additional extras were all they were cracked up to be. Everybody jump on board but make sure to bring some hot chocolate and a nice warm blanket as it's going to be a long but fun filled ride.",1133049600,7,5317,4.801092896174864
2343065,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Jameson Thottam checking out Polar Express

The Basics from Jameson Thottam

Polar Express goes 3/4 of the way in every department, the story, the script, the voice/acting. If you've ever ridden the subway and had to quit ten stops before your destination, you'll realize the degree of annoyance and letdown involved. Tom Hanks voices 6 characters in this movie version of the justly celebrated children's book of the same name. Four of them are worth keeping, providing for some adjustments. Santa himself is not one of them.

Review of the Child Characters: Jameson Thottam

Of the three child characters, I'd say about 1/3 of each characterization is dated and worn out--even vaguely token and perhaps insulting. I'll leave that for Jesse Helms and Jesse Jackson to fight it out. From starting gate to the 100 minute mark this train steams forward in full action/adventure mode. But even here, warning signs begin first to tink, then to sound, then to BLAIR LOUDLY.

Jameson Luke Thottam: Story Line

Our story begins with Hero Boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus, the veracity of the North Pole mythos, and well on the path toward discovering the elves' origins in Norse/Icelandic pagan god mythos. As he was on his way toward discovering new and intriguing things about the cultures of the planet on which he lived, he must be stopped immediately. And so on Christmas Eve, what arrives at the scheduled hour of dreamtime but the Polar Express to take him on the path to North Pole enlightenment.

Jameson L Thottam: Multiple Adventures

From there to the North Pole many adventures unveil, but a sense of repetition creeps in after, say, the fifth jittery roller coaster downhill slope on a runaway train. I loved the sequence involving the lost ticket which tips its hat in the most unlikely direction of Winged Migration in terms of ""how the hell did they get that shot?"" The first roller-coaster type action scene with Hero Boy trying to retrieve the ticket -- great, but very similar sequences just grind the adrenaline down.

Jameson Thottam: Summary

I disliked every single minute of the last twenty which are all bromides like ""keep the spirit of Christmas in your heart."" The entire last 2/3 of the North pole scenes almost destroyed the good will built up in the previous 95 minutes -- and it's really not as if the first third of that portion were really inventive or new like parts of the first portion of the film. The North Pole gift terminal scenes, while enjoyable, have a vague air of TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY familiarity to them. Visually and cinematically ranging from good to sporadically amazing in it's first two thirds, the last third settles for just plain lazy, and that is not a gift I'd want to give for Christmas.",1133049600,5,2777,4.80293501048218
2343066,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This movie brought me to tears and is perhaps the best Christmas movie since ""Miracle On 34th Street"" or ""A Christmas Story.""  What's not to like about this movie??? Based  on the classic book- a boy who has begun to doubt Santa exsist and is slowly losing the magic of Christmas hops onbroad the Polar Express and travels to the North Pole.

On the train meeting kids who truly believe or having Christmas doubts themselves.

Arriving at the North Pole in an unbelievable holiday scene he slowly realizes that believeing is seeing what you can't. Upon meeting Santa and making some friends on the Polar Express. This precious little boy realizes Santa exsists in the hearts of all who believe.

Tom Hanks as always in OUTSTANDING performing in mulitply roles in the movie. The animation is simply beautiful better than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Shrek"" for each scene and frame looks like your watching an moving oil painting.

The songs are beautiful and will get you into the holiday spirit.

In short this movie is PURE genius... but, to my surprise the kids in my family did not like the story that much-probably because they could not relate. As an adult- I totally understood the emphsasis placed in the movie- that as you get older the magic slowly dies and the spirit/excitement about Christmas does as well. So when I saw the final scene I couldn't help but cry for I knew that I will NEVER again be able to hear the sound of that precious bell-that rings for those who believe.

This movie is a rare Christmas movie- that is solely focused on the true nature/spirit of Christmas. If your an adult you simply MUST rent or buy this movie this season you'll find yourself-wishing you could still believe. 5-Stars All the Way!",1132963200,4,1725,4.66996699669967

The North Pole is an industrial wasteland. The elves are pretty creepy and Santa seems more mean than jolly.

The visuals are pretty but the animators ran into trouble with the eyes and mouths of the characters. The eyes looked dead and the mouths were stiff.

And did anybody else find the Jewish elf amusing? It seemed kind of out of place in a Christmas movie. But notably, this movie had nothing at all to do with Christ.",1132963200,5,736,4.169014084507042

Not exactly a lump of coal but a disappointment considering the talent involved(Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks).  Once the train  reached it's destination, the North Pole, is when the film for me began to gel.  It is at this juncture of the film where the characters, CGI though they may be, develope identities and you start to empathize with them.  The film's message of believing in the spirit of Christmas was palpable and not some cynical catchphrase.  What accounts for the film's split personality?  My guess is that in fleshing out a thin illustrated children's book to feature length the filmmakers didn't have enough material so they compensated with visual fluorishes.

The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.

Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book.  For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two.  We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money!

But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet.  Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer.

Tom Hanks is the nominal ""star"" who performs five different computer-generated characters, but it's the visuals that steal this show, as director Robert Zemeckis indulges his tireless pursuit of technological innovation.",1132704000,2,877,5.859375
2343089,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis, the same team who brought us such great movies as ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"", have teamed up again, and they deliver perhaps their best movie ever in this classic adaptation of the popular children's book.

On Christmas Eve, a massive steam train suddenly appears in front of a boy's home.  The conductor, one of Hanks' many roles in the film, jumps off and asks if the boy is getting on.  The boy asks where the train is going.  ""To the North Pole!"" is the conductor's reply.  After thinking it over, the boy gets on the train and he, along with several other children are soon on their way to the North Pole to see Santa.  We are introduced to some other children along the way; a young African-American girl, a Know-It-All boy, and a shy boy.  During the course of the film, all of them become very good friends.

As the train makes its way north, the viewer is treated to many breathtaking special effects.  The scenes where the train is going up and down the mountain passes and sliding over the frozen lake are true high points of the film.  I've never seen special effects this eye-popping before in an animated film.  They are simply superb.  Upon reaching the North Pole, the children are informed that one of them will receive the first gift of Christmas.  However, before this can happen, the children must overcome having their car come uncoupled from the rest of the train, and sliding down a long slide and ending up in Santa's bag.  Who will Santa choose to recieve the first Christmas gift?

Having three small children, I've seen my share of animated children's films in the last few years, but none of those even come close to this tremendous film.  The story is very touching, and the visual effects are out of this world.  I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I watch his movies every chance I get.  His roles in this movie are some of his very best, but his role as the wise and caring conductor is perhaps his best.  Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  As long as you can still hear the sleighbell jingle, then you'll always be a true believer.",1132704000,2,2120,4.485639686684073

In The Polar Express, many children enter the train but only two step outside themselves to see what's truly important, friendship.

This movie is in line with the classic X-mas movies of old (Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life) and also in line with those great Rankin-Bass X-mas specials of the 1960s & 1970s (Rudolph, Frosty, and so on.)  I'm a stickler when it comes to X-mas movies, and this movie is amazing.  Not only am I a X-mas nut, I'm a train nut as well.  Both sides of me enjoyed this movie enormously.

The look of this movie is spectacular, the digital anamation is the ONLY way this movie could have been done to capture the look and feel of the book.  Live action would not have been right, and regular cell animation would not be right either.  This was literally the movie jumping right out of the book.

The songs are great.  The train is great.  Tom Hanks is great.

You truly must be Scrooge (pre-ghost Scrooge that is) if you watch this movie and don't shed a tear of joy and end up with an incredible warm feeling afterwards.

Director Robert Zemeckis uses an all-digital technology that captures real-life motion, and all of the latest computer effects to create a visual feast.  The plot is about a doubting young boy who joins a trainful of skeptics for a Christmas Eve journey to the North Pole.  It is a benign, politcally-correct, and fun tale, suitable for children.

The effects will enthrall kids and adults.  The North Pole has a wonderful Northest-USA city of the 1920's look and the train almost steals the show.  Locomotive 1225 (get it?) is a digitalization with real sound recordings from real-life Pere Marquette engine 1225 which escaped the scrapper's torch in part because of that number.

But if there is a show-stealer, it is Tom Hanks, who lends his voice and visage to five characters, most notably the hobo and the conductor.

This isn't the best Christmas film ever made (my vote goes to ""the Bishop's Wife"" or the George C. Scott version of A Christmas Carol) but Polar Express IS a worthy addition to the pantheon!",1132531200,5,1235,4.765258215962441
2343108,5,B0009XRZ9M,"During the holiday season every year Hollywood unleashes a deluge of Christmas movies to capitalize on the season. As a result, a lot of garbage infests the movie screens each November and December. However, once in a while a good Christmas movie comes along. An even more rare occurance is a great Christmas movie finding its way to the screens. That's exactly what we have with Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. This is a film which is destined to become a classic. It will be a holiday favorite loved by generations to come. The story tells of a young boy who has lost his faith in the holiday season, who soon finds himself on a  journey to the North Pole supposedly to see Santa Claus in the flesh.

Robert Zemeckis, the visionary director and effects wizard behind Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, brings to vivid life the storybook by Chris Van Allsburg. The movie uses cutting-edge computer animation technology to bring the book's images to life with stunning realism. The amazing visuals alone are reason enough to see The Polar Express. It is an astonishing ride that you won't soon forget. However, there's more to it than just stunning visuals. There is heart, emotion and genuine Christmas warmth and spirit. The movie brings to life a magical feeling that no other recent Christmas movie has even come close to.

The cutting-edge ""motion capture"" technology used to bring the characters to life results in very realistic human characters the likes of which we aren't used to seeing in an animated film. Some people find it ""creepy"", but I could not relate. Perhaps being a lover of horror films and David Lynch and David Cronenberg has desensitized me to said ""creepiness"", but I felt only genuine warmth and magic in this film. It's a little bit dark at times, it's not always bright and cheery. It's a little mysterious at first, but I don't see any reason to be creeped out.

The Polar Express is an absolutely wonderful movie. A perfect holiday movie for young or old, it brilliantly captures the excitement and feeling of Christmas like few other movies. With stunning visuals and groundbreaking animation as well as a whole lot of heart and soul, The Polar Express is a ride that no one should miss.",1132444800,3,2237,4.74293059125964
2343138,2,B0009XRZ9M,"As a technological feat, it has its moments.  In spite of the weirdly passive storyline, the atmosphere of snow and night and travel has a kind of kinetic beauty.  But there's no getting around the story, which, in film and book, is the product of reactionary minds.  Why this boy?  Why now?  Why the nauseatingly patriarchal and self-congratulatory Santa?  Why the masses of worshipping elves?  It's all very ""Triumph of the Will"" -- ""Metropolis"" with a Christmas Tree.

Actually, the irrationality of giving the first present of Christmas to the boy is even more pronounced in the film, in spite of the filmmakers' effort to make him a worthy and active hero.  The little African American girl (the children aren't even dignified with names), the real greatheart of the story, is condescendingly dismissed by Santa, as if she were a faithful cook or a maid when, in fact, she's the one who should have been given the present.  Revolting.

The message of the film is, of course, dictatorial: Believe.  That's an imperative, folks, and the implication is that if you don't you'll go to hell.  We've heard that song before.  This is a movie for people who think the capital gains tax should be eliminated, that people are rich and successful because God loves them more than He loves others, and who blindly support the oligarchic horrors of the current administration in Washington.

2343140,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Addressing the review Soulles Christmas.

Since when does a move (book, painting, poem etc.) need to have a universal theme? Certainly there are many who don't have Christmas as a cultural tradition, but certainly find other reasons to enjoy the company of family and friends in the spirit of giving at least once a year (well apparently some don't). How exceptionally dull this world would be without cultural distinctiveness anyway. Of course there are some inclined to force their views upon those around them with a sense of indignation toward the recipient. Have we not learned the folly in this yet?

I don't see why some feel it is compulsory to view Christmas from the standpoint of capitalism (slaves and coca-cola, that descends to inventive level). Is it possible to realize that the central idea could be about giving (that should be universal)? Of course when someone finds it necessary to preface any gift giving they do with ""You know how hard I had to work to buy you these things,"" I prefer they keep the item and work a little less, they may realize that giving isn't really a sacrifice (you can actually feel good doing it - imagine that).

Polar Express is simply I fun movie wrapped up in a Christmas theme. If Santa gets under your skin, because he offends your grown-up, seriously minded, it's all about me, soulless view of the world, go back to your scheming ways and board rooms this movie will grate on your nerves. If you like trains and unique animation give it a go it's actually quite fun to watch.

PS Edward Scissorhands is a great movie also <g>.",1132185600,6,1580,4.672661870503597

2343142,2,B0009XRZ9M,"Well, in the first place this is scary.  Scary in a Leni Refenhstal level (ok, probably I mispelled her last name).  Christmas is not universal, and Santa Claus (called many names in many countries) is less so.  This movie says that if you don't believe in a fat old man in a Coca-Cola suit that has a big factory with many many workers slaved in the North Pole you're out.  This kind of novo-fascism is not new for Robert Zemeckis: all of you remember that ode to stupidity and conformity that was ""Ggggump... Forrest Gump"" (I couldn't resist it, sorry).
Since I was a child my parents told me that there is not such thing as Santa, and so I learned to judge my presents as a proof of the hard work (giving the proper economic conditions) that my parents did during the year (or at least that month).
So, the movie.
The animation is incredible (for 2004) but the faults in the characters' eyes and mouths make all the effort almost worthless.  Some rollercoaster moments must be great when seeying them in IMAX-3D (I suposse), but for most of us is a second-hand experience, when yout hink this would be great in such screen or another.  When the best sequence in all the film involves a train ticket blown by the wind (a motive by now in Zemeckis filmography) but none of the human characters is in it, you have a problem.  Still, a must for CGI fans.
Btw, the score by Alan Silverstri sounds like a half-baked version of the sublime score Danny Elfman composed for ""Edward Scissorhands"" (now that's a Christmas story!).",1131926400,9,1522,4.512727272727273
2343143,5,B0009XRZ9M,"When people go into a movie theatre they expect to be entertained. Audiences want to be scared, amused, curious, sad, and hopefull. Believe it or not, this film provides all of those elements and then some. I've read the comments by people who gave passed this film on as either ""too scary to children"" or ""just plain boring with no plot"" And I agree with several people who have responded to such comments.

This film isn't going to give you instant gratification halfway through. If you don't have two hours to spare then you aren't going to understand what this movie is about. Sure the plot was invisible at times, but I don't think the point of the movie was to have the audience follow a plot. The point was to reveal or in some cases remind people of the simplistic faith or child like view we once had in our lives.

Think of the characters themselves and what they represent. Hero Boy reminds us of people who are caught in between faith and doubt. Do we trust what we cannot see? Who is to say? Hero Girl shows the stronger side of faith and believing in what is not readily seen to the human eye. Childlke faith personified into a little girl. Lonely Boy represent those who doubt because they haven't truly experienced the joys of life or  have had tragedies happen to them from an early age so they learn to only trust themselves, but that ends up leaving them...lonely. Then are those who are the Know-It-All character who claim to take everything at face value (much like the critics and cynics of this film).  They want to know it all because what they don't know scares them.

I'm 21 years old and I haven't had nearly enough experiences in life, but I can say that I had been so busy growing up that I had forgotten that there was a part of me that was once simple, happy and appreciated the joys of just believing that things were true. That is until life makes you grow up and tries to distort your beliefs (much like HoboMan in this film).

When I first saw this movie my eyes widened with every new frame. It was the first time since my childhood that I can remember sitting in the audience with my mouth open and my eyes stretched out as far as they can be. I was stunned, by the artistry and complexity of the story. I was a kid again for two hours. It was like an old friend who I hadn't seen in a long time came back to visit. It was an amazing film.

It's a train ride, a leap of faith, a test of the human spirit. It's a ride and like the movie says: ""It's not about where the train takes you, what matters is that you get on."" THAT, my friend, is what this movie is about. Not being entertained by slapstick humor or satirical sarcasm, but remembering that part of you that resembles the kids in the movie. Believe.

Zemeckis and the company that released this version should be ashamed and made to give REFUNDS TO ALL that GOT SCAMMED and bought this GARBAGE 3-D version of this film.

2343161,5,B0009XRZ9M,"We gr. 5 teachers in our town took our students to see the movie at the local theater. I am the type of person that if I am not hooked into the movie in the first 20 minutes, I know it is going to be a long sit with a nap to boot! However, my students were riveted, I was riveted into the movie from the first minute onward.

The computer animation was very intense. The scenics, the details, the inter-relationships of all aspects of the movie were very much on target, highly synchronized, and surround-real. If there was anyone who could not follow the storyline, the rides themselves were mind bending. Rollercoastering up the and doen the mountain, skidding across the ice, looking down into the off tracks abyss of the train-central roundhouse! If that doesn't get your adrenaline going, shame on you!  Then there were the quiet moments in the film, just at the right spots, to keep you feeling safe and secure.

I can see why this movie was more successful using computer animation rather than real actors. The action would be entirely too dangerous for both adult actors and child actors. This is the type of movie that requires the mind to take flight in a fantasy in which the child in all of us takes in fanatasy that is real and into a reality that is fantasy.

I realize that I am a little cryptic on this topic, but I don't want to spoil the effects for those who have not yet seen this movie. It is a must see. It is also a large screen adventure in order to be the fly on the wall or the engaged spectator in the film.  Yes, this movie is so engrossing that you feel as if you are a silent part of the story, right in there with the characters. Can this movie be frightening? Yes, it can be. But then so is reality at times.

Age group viewing?  I wouldn't encourage this movie for children younger than 6.  Children need to be old enough to have experienced remembering a few Christmases past in order to enjoy the nuiances of the children's individual delimmas on the Polar Express train. The older viewers need to have a safe person with them to hold onto during those wild rides in, on top of the train, and throughout the different sceneries.

The music played throught was wonderful. I really liked the duet of the boy and girl over Josh Groban's contribution. But since he is the current spotlight songster soloist with a recognizable name, he got the top billing. Kudos to the children who performed the duets, and to the children whose voices were in the other works as the group singers. For the grampies in us and for ourselves, there were the remniscent works of Frank Sinatra and the Andrews sisters, along with Bing Crosby with their now national Christmas anthems of the old favorites. All a terrific meld of music, song, and adventure.

It is so amazing that in our pluralistic society we have more lost sight of the thrilling adventures of childhood at Christmastime, all in the guise of not wanting to offend religious sensitivies. At the same time we the public are very willing to entertain our disbelief in the dark sides of fantasy with flesh eating creeps, zombies, and other ghoulish entertainments of the mind's reality; stupid'em ups, blow'em ups and cheat'em ups, and slice off the heads in video games and other flying bod parts destruction action movies. The Polar Express movie was a refreshing relief from all of that.

It is about time that Polar Express pulled into town, again! And, just as another reviewer wrote, it would have been nice if the ribboned bell (and the expanded jr. novel of Polar Express) were available along with the dvd online as a package deal, or even as a separate package.

2343165,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I took my five-year-old daughter to this last January.  I was not very excited about doing so; Christmas was over, and I'm not a huge fan of children's fare or big Hollywood productions or any movie that has an acclaimed ""major star.""  I'm especially repulsed by special effects and so-called technological ""advances."" I'm one of those espresso-drinking independent and foreign film guys.  But, my little girl wanted to go this thing, so I had to oblige.

Folks, almost from the get-go this movie captivated me.  It truly is visually spectacular, dreamy, surreal even. The story itself I found very gripping; this train-ride the movie depicts is just wild, if not fully psychedelic.  There are all kinds of magical and mystical sub-plots going on.  The North Pole depiction is incredible.  There are various little points made throughout which have pleasant humanitarian principles. The movie emphasizes compassion for others in ways that should really affect children positively.  I left the theater enthralled; I spoke of and thought of the movie for much longer than my daughter, who also loved it.

In fact, here I am writing this review in September.  The movie has kind of lingered in my subconscious for the last nine months.  There is no doubt that this movie will obtain ""classic"" status; long after Nemo and Monsters, Inc. and all these other animated movies fade into obscurity (a prediction I make based on the sheer volume of these movies nowadays; I can hardly keep track of them all; it is cuteness and cleverness overload at our local theaters)this movie will surface as very special.  I'm buying this for MY collection; my daughters will be merely allowed to BORROW it, provided they don't touch the disc with their little fingers.  I want them to watch this a hundred times, but I want it in good shape for me to watch some more as well!

Bottom-line: Incredible.  Awesome work by all involved.",1126396800,11,1912,4.909657320872274
2343166,5,B0009XRZ9M,"It's truly a wonderful Christmas classic for the family. The movie teaches children to have faith-to believe, and it also reminds adults the true spirit of Christmas. I think it's a very clever to present the movie like an animated cartoon, because it gives a fantasy-like feeling. Tom Hanks and the children acted fine in this film. They expressed their character's feelings really well.

The theme song ""Believe"" by Josh Groban is a really powerful song that captures the Christmas spirit and sums up the central message of the movie. I love this song very much.

Go get it if you haven't already!

When it was over he asked if we could see it again.

This is a movie that has all the magic of Christmas. It is a pity that it was released the same time as The Incredibles, so got overlooked by many. This story has several who need to learn a lesson, like the one who is losing all faith in Christmas, and is becoming cynical about other things. He is taken on the way by the Conductor, the mysterious Hobo and his companions. With it, a kid who has been left out of the magic, a know-it-all and others like them are given exactly what they need.

I wish I had seen it on IMAX. The depth of the animation is incredible. The only weak part of the movie was that dance with the waiters, which I agree should have been left on the cutting room floor, as it distracted from the main theme.

Polar Express is definitely a Christmas classic.  The animation is amazing...especially the steam coming from the radiator and train.  Despite what some critics say, I thought that they did an excellent job in the animation of the characters.  Yes, they are at times a little less than perfect, but it did not detract from the experience.

2343186,2,B0009XRZ9M,"I took my daughter to see this movie just after Christmas.  I heard mostly good reviews about it and it seemed like a very good movie from what I saw from the trailers (the computer graphics looked amazing).  But I also heard from many parents I knew that their children were so frightened by this movie that they had to leave the theater early.  I sort of poo-poohed them, thinking that some kids were afraid of everything.  I wish I hadn't.

There were only two good things about this movie.  1.  The scenery is (mostly) beautiful beyond belief and looks real, and 2.  my daughter was not frightened, though I wouldn't have been surprised if she was.  If I was three years old and saw this movie, I would have probably screamed the whole way through.  It's not like any Christmas movie I've ever seen.  There's nothing cheerful or uplifting about it.  It's very dark, depressing, & scary.  It's much more reminscient of a Halloween movie than a Christmas one.  I wish I had never taken my daughter to see it.  The theme seemed to be, ""If you don't believe in Santa Claus, you're going to have to go on a train ride from hell and scare the pants off of you.""  That doesn't seem to be a very good thing to tell young children.

Not only does it not have a very good story, but the characters are very unoriginal and wooden too.  They all only have one quality--the main character is brave, maybe too brave (he climbs onto the top of a moving train in the middle of a snow storm to get a friend's train ticket for example), one is saintly, one is withdrawn and depressed, while another is annoying beyond belief.  None were even the slightest bit interesting.  Though the scenery was realistic, the human characters were stiff and lifeless, resembling the animatronic characters on Disney Rides.  Far away they look real enough, but when you get closer, it's more than obvious they're only manniquins.

I figured while watching the movie that when the traumatic train ride was over that the North Pole would be amazing and stunningly beautiful.  I was wrong about that too.  The town at the North Pole looked like something you'd see behind the Iron Curtain in the 1950's, boring, bland, and desolate, while all the elves (all male and all clones of each other) and even Santa, looked a little bit creepy.  Near the end, the elves enjoy a concert put on by than no other than Aerosmith, which seemed very odd and didn't fit with the overly serious & melancholy tone of the movie.

I would definitely not recommend this movie, especially for young children.  I only gave it two stars because of the incredible background scenery and the train (which is designed to perfection and looks like it could be real.)  Other than that, it's not very good at all.  Maybe model train enthusiasts would like it, or people who enjoy freaking out young children, but other than that, I can't think of anyone else who would possibly enjoy this movie.",1114041600,11,2934,4.567049808429119

2343197,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Until the buzz surrounding THE POLAR EXPRESS started about six months ago, I had never heard of the children's book the movie is based upon. Therefore, I had never read the book when I watched the movie. I just want to get that out in the open to begin with.

I enjoyed THE POLAR EXPRESS. It's an entertaining movie with a lot of profound themes that, though dressed up in the finest that humanism has to offer, are really deeply religious in nature. Nevertheless, even if one is unable to extrapolate those spiritual nuances, the movie offers enough visual eye candy and action to make it worth watching and, despite the film's criticism, it is destined to become a Christmas classic.

The movie revolves around the adventures that arrive at a young boy's house on Christmas Eve. The boy is never given a name and is listed in the credits as Hero Boy. The Hero Boy is at a critical time in his life: he is on the verge of adolescence and is having serious doubts about the existence of Santa Claus. He lies in his bed on Christmas Eve listening for the sound of reindeer bells. However, instead of bells his ears are greeted by a sound unexpected, that of a train whistle. As he looks out the window and opens the front door, he is greeted by a splendid engine pulling a train called The Polar Express. He's invited aboard by the Conductor. At first he hesitates, but then chooses to ride. And thus begins a somewhat harrowing journey that takes the boy from the top of the moving train, across a frozen lake, and all the way to the top of the world at the North Pole.

The animation in THE POLAR EXPRESS is at times amazingly realistic. There are times in the movie where one cannot tell at all that this is a cartoon. Non-living objects are the ones that are consistently most brilliant. There are times when it is clear that the characters are cartoons and not actors, but almost all of the inanimate objects from presents, to hot chocolate, to the engine of The Polar Express itself look completely real. When presented in the moments when the human characters appear least ""real"" it is as though we are watching some strange world akin to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.

There are several moments in the movie where the main characters partake in dangerous situations that should in no way ever be attempted in real life. Younger children might find these scenes frightening. However, in the tale the film tells, the adventures are needed. Every hero lives a life of adventure full of danger and the life lived to the fullest is one in which danger cannot be avoided.

I did finally read the book by Chris Van Allsburg a few days after seeing the film. The book is full of incredible illustrations but is also very short (32 pages). I felt that the filmmakers did a wonderful job of expanding upon the pages of Van Allsburg's writing and illustrations. I felt that the film also did a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book, presenting the message of the book in a way that gives it even more meaning, depth, and interpretaion.

The children's book is a simple tale about a boy's struggle to believe in Santa Claus and how he came to believe. It's a message the children love and brings back nostalgia and causes reflection in adults. The movie was created in such a way that this message is seriously expanded. The simple tale becomes a profound allegory of faith. There are messengers (the Conductor). There companions who believe (Hero Girl), disbelieve (Know-It-All), and are profoundly confused (Lonely Boy). There is the Jesus-figure (Santa) and his often unseen angels (elves). And there is also Satan (Hobo), who is allowed to ride along for the ride and tempt. Much more could be said about the religious implications of the film, but these illustrations make the point.

Overall, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an entertaining movie. It's a different kind of Christmas movie, but one with enough substance and charm that ensure it will become a Christmas classic. All you have to do is believe.",1104969600,,4007,4.611500701262272
2343198,4,B0009XRZ9M,"This is not a movie about Santa Claus but a metaphor for belief in God.  Santa was hardly the merry person seen in just about every other Christmas movie ever made.  He didn't even look like Santa.  He looked more like an old testament prophet in a red suit.

The North Pole was one of the weirdest places I've ever seen depicted.  It was a far cry from Rudolph's North Pole where the elves sang all the time.  Why all the disembodied recordings?  Was there no money left over for original Christmas music?  Didn't look like Heaven either.  It made me think more of the Catholic Limbo, somewhere between life and death.  If I were one of those kids, I'd want to get out of there quick.  Even 3-D didn't help.

Not that movie wasn't fun.  The kids were all good.  The boy and girl heroes were born leaders.  The obnoxious kid with the glasses really made me laugh.  Billy, the sad kid, was suitably mysterious.  Wonder what was in his package?  The scene where they served the hot chocolate was my favorite.

All in all, a good movie I'd like to see again.",1104883200,2,1055,4.345360824742268

It is the rare occasion when any film does a good book justice, but one as short as this...I could not imagine what they would do with it.  What they did was create an absolutely delightful film that our entire family enjoyed.

The storyline was compelling and the computer animation was beyond superb.  It was possible, at times, to forget that this was animated.  The people and scenes looked so real.

I highly recommend this film and, if you live in the city, do try to see it in 3-D.  We could have but we opted for the plain version.  I can imagine it is even a better experience.  I think we may go back and do that. :-)",1104710400,,726,4.202898550724638
2343200,4,B0009XRZ9M,"A lot of good reviews (positive and nagative) concerning this film.  the detractors find some good and the supporters find some flaw.  To me, that makes sense.  In a nut-shell this is a film full of ""WOW!!"" moments with enough flaws to make you go ""Hmmm?"".  I won't nitpick the story.  It's compelling enough.  Probably more danger than I'd like to see a nine-year-old face, but that's part of what makes it compelling.  What I do nit-pick is the overall ""feal"" of the film.  Sometimes it's spine chilling...  ... and sometimes just chilling.  Here's a list of the things that made me go ""WOW"" and ""Hmmm?""....

WOW!!!
-The overall texture of the film is mind-boggling.  I'd need to see it 20 time to appreciate every detail the artist have included.
-The train.  I love trains, and this depiction is just awesome.  Never watch this without, AT LEAST, a decent home theater.  the sound penetrates you.
-The flying ticket scene.  A great, uncut sequence.  I think I like it so much because no people are involved for most of it.
-The last perils before reaching the North Pole are riveting.  Unfortunately it is literally down hill from there.
-""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is a spine tingling moment.
-The overall scale of things is pretty impressive, but....

Hmmm?
-Things are sometimes so big they are forboding or even down-right scary.  The Northpole is a big and scary place.
-The elfs are creepy.  Most have bad skin and razor stubble.  They could also use Hermee to fix there teeth.
-You may have heard, Santa is a bit wierd looking. All of the character move in an unatural way and the insides of their mouths are spooky and mysterious.  And then there's those lifeless eyes....
-This is picky, but nicely rendered as everything is, why couldn't they make the facial hair NOT look like it was glued on?
That bugged me throughout the film.
-Steven Tyler makes the scariest elf of them all.  Really out of place.
-Overall, the film fealt populated by zombies.  The dancing waiters were the strangest of all.

Dispite these ""little"" comlaints, I'd have to advise seeing this film.  It had enough magic to make it compelling, and enough excitement to shake your nerves.  My 2 year old son (a train freek with an ear infection) made it about 3/4 through until they stopped showing the train.  Then he cried allot.  We took him out and he cried to get back in.  So, we stood on the side and held him through the last 20 minutes of the film.  The point is, scary as stuff was, he liked it and I enjoyed it too.  And forget the book.  The only thing you'll see from the book is the beginning and the end,  come to think of it, that is the book!",1104710400,6,2647,4.524312896405919
2343201,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Oh to be a child again.  The Polar Express was indeed the most enchanting movie I've seen in years.  Yes, if you grew believing in Santa Claus and Christmas this movie is definitely a treat.  It has all the fixings of a holiday movies that follows in the same vane as ""A Miracle on 34th Street"" as well as other Christmas tinged films, such as ""A Christmas Story"" that provide a sense of child-like nostalgia that might date back Christmas memories of the 1930s, 40s, or 50s.  Also, the film carries on the tradition of Clement Moore's ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"".

The animation is excellent and effective.  The computer graphics provide one romp of a ride on the Polar Express that simulates a disney-like quality like riding on the matterhorn.  And the film soundtrack isn't bad at all -- what would a Christmas film be without Kate Smith, Bing Crosby, Perry Como and host others singing those beloved tunes like ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" or ""Jingle Bells?""  And for those rockers out there, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith adds a little raunchy tune that'll keep the elves jumpin' and jivin'.

So grab a seat, savor some hot cocoa, or simply watch the film and become enchanted with one great movie that won't leave the child in you disappointed.",1104624000,,1257,4.677272727272728

Those roles are Hero Boy, Hero Boy's Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. He voices 5 of them and his motion capture is on all 6 of them. Robert Zemeckis' directing is excellent. The powerful emotion of the movie stays with you even until after the movie is over.",1104624000,,426,4.618421052631579
2343203,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I saw this movie in 3D at the IMAX theatre in downtown San Francisco.  The technical features are spectacular.  There are several breathtaking scenes, including snowflakes falling down from the sky, the train sliding right over you on the ice, the roller coaster ride in the North Pole, and three children walking on a very high bridge.

There is not much beyond technical brilliance.  The movie lacks emotional warmth and magic that usually exist in a Christmas movie, such as Elf or The Santa Clause.  The train conductor and the guy on top of the train are sometimes too creepy, maybe that is why some young kids do not like the movie.  This movie won't make you a believer of Santa Clause for sure.",1104537600,4,702,4.620967741935484

The movie also has the voices of Jimmy Bennett, Eddie Deezen, and the late Michael Jeter. The movie set up is this, on Christmas Eve a train stops in front of boys and girl's house that cause trouble, or start doubting the existance of Santa Claus (Tom Hanks) and takes them to the North Pole to meet Santa, and he picks one child to get the first present. So it is the night of Christmas Eve, a tain pulls up the hero Boy's (Tom Hanks again) house, the train's Conductor gets out to greet him, and every child's house they stop, the boy asks to where, and the Conductor says the North Pole, of course the boy doesn't want to get on, but changes his mind in time before he leaves his house. On the train is other children including Hero Girl (Nona Gaye, daughter of the late singer Marvin Gaye). The conductor takes the children's ticket, which somehow magical appears. But forgets about the hero girl, but when Hero Boy discovers the ticket, the boy loses the ticket, and the conductor takes the girl away.",1104451200,,1315,4.39344262295082
2343205,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The Polar Express is an adaptation of a beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The plot follows ""Hero Boy"", who lies awake on Christmas Eve contemplating the existence of Santa Claus. All of a sudden, the calm of the holy night is distrupted by the appearance of a train that is ready to take him to the North Pole. Once he makes the decision to board the train, the adventure begins.

Like any short story that is transferred to the big screen, the filmaker must expand upon the original story to have enough content to fill a full-length feature film time slot. In this case, some extra characters are added on the train, to give the film a little more depth. Some of these, particularly the hero girl, worked. Others, such as the hobo, seem like an ill-conceived addition. The confusing interplay of these different characters threatens to undermine the original premise of the movie.

So why does this film still rate as 5 stars? Quite simply, because of the sense of WONDER it creates. The exquisite animation and storybook feel to an action film leaves an indelible mark upon the senses. The wonder and beauty of the Christmas season is markedly visible on the screen.",1104451200,,1182,4.705314009661835
2343206,3,B0009XRZ9M,"What disappointed me about The Polar Express?  Looking forward to this movie--though I've never read the book--I took my 11-year-old nephew Brandon to see it yesterday evening in Times Square.  He liked the movie, and couldn't stop feeling sorry for the Lonely Boy who fell in the snow while rushing to catch the train.

My view: the movie is beautifully drawn, and has some touching moments, but I suspect that it'll never make me cry like other do-you-believe-in-Santa movies like Miracle on 34th Street or even The Santa Clause.  In Miracle, the issue wasn't just believing in Santa but in what he stood for: love, faith, generosity, perhaps even justice and mercy.  In Clause, it was family relations.  In contrast, Polar Express' issue seems limited to just believing in Santa Claus, and perhaps in Christmas magic.

Also, the characters are ill-motivated.  Yes, Hero Boy, the main character, is doubting the existance of Santa Claus, but why is that a tragedy in itself (as opposed to, say, losing faith in everything, like Doris Walker of Miracle)?  Lonely Boy says ""Christmas never worked for me?"" but we don't find out why, and I doubt a large candy-striped package would be enough to make it ""work"".  Hmm..maybe it's because Polar Express never challenges commercialism, or society's misuse of Christmas, like the other two movies do.

Also, the danger Hero Boy puts himself into just to retrieve Hero Girl's ticket seems uncalled for.  Yes, kids were in danger in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but there were characters around saying ""No! Don't!""  Maybe Polar Express doesn't have enough character conflict.

Or maybe it was too inflated from its storybook beginnings.  Like How the Grinch Stole Christmas, perhaps Polar Express would've worked better as a 30-minute short than as a full-length movie.  Or maybe all the diverse elements: the animated drawings, the expanded plot--just didn't gell well together.

Yes, Polar Express is worth watching once or twice, but I doubt I'll fall in love with it.",1104364800,22,2023,5.045180722891566

The power of this film resides in its visuals.  A process called ""performance capture"" was used to wed the performances of real actors to computer simulated characters and environments based on the artwork of children's author Chris Van Allsburg.  There are many magical and innovative sequences, such as the one in which we follow a lost ticket as it flutters through the air, going through a series of adventures of its own before ending up back on the train where it started.  Santa's village, which looks like a deserted Eastern European village, is quite creepy.  Christmas carols echo from loudspeakers, but they always seem to be somewhere off in the distance.

Concerning the story, there's not much going on.  The original book is quite slim, so the movie pumps up the story to feature length with lots of action-filled misadventures.  It ends up telling the story of a journey without really having much to say about it.  Furthermore, I'm not a religious person, but even I was struck by the irony of a secular Christmas story being about a crisis of faith.  In addition, this film is really not a musical, so it's quite jarring when the characters break into song at one point.  Having said all that, I feel that the visual style of the film elevates it and grants it a power and resonance that is not present in the script./",1104019200,2,1548,4.592727272727273
2343214,4,B0009XRZ9M,"""A grave and disappointing failure, as much of imagination as of technology."" - Manohla Dargis, New York Post

""There's only so much that digital information can convey about what makes a human being human."" - Ty Burr, Boston Globe

""There's a deeper, shivery tone, instead of the mindless jolliness of the usual Christmas movie."" - Rober Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times

""The first film in a long time to capture that ineffable whatever it is that people hope to find when they go to a Christmas movie."" - Mike LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle

These reviews are a small fraction of the professional and occupational critical reaction, but they hint at the wide variety of ways to react to a film of this kind at this time (of the year).

At the risk of trivializing my own write-up, I've come to believe there may be as many perspectives from which to view a complex movie as there are persons in the country, or perhaps the world. But that does not mean we cannot bring focus or clarity to certain elements within one.

At any rate, to build on Ebert's thought above - whatever else may be said - it seems clear that Robert Zemeckis' holiday film THE POLAR EXPRESS is the most unique Christmastime picture to come around in quite a while.

For the record, none of the main characters have real names: they are known, respectively, as Boy, Girl, Conductor, Know-It-All, and Loner.

The film opens to show us Boy going to bed on Christmas Eve, appropriately minimally narrated by his older and (we must assume) grown-up voice (Tom Hank's). Having 'looked up' the North Pole before finally retiring, his attention is drawn to a loud noise and a bright light outside his bedroom window. Boy goes outside ... to see a train appear behind all the steam. The Conductor welcomes him aboard for a northerly journey that is destined to become a magical night to cherish and remember.

As one might expect from its title, the film revolves (always in some way or other) around Santa, alas, without reference to a newborn Messiah. As Plugged-In's review has suggested, occasional danger might scare young tots; a PG rating seems more appropriate. That said, I did enjoy the train attendants' dancing routine, somewhat reminiscent of a Disney musical. I was amused to see Girl's ticket escape Boy's hand and the train, float through the air, get knocked around by various forces of nature, and land again, wherever that was. I liked that it contained peril, and Steamey and Smokey's desperate attempts to save the train from it (not to mention their other oddities). Also, that `Hobo' guy is never explained adds to the mystery the movie tries to convey. And the CGI animation looks good (though some critics have complained).

I must confess that I have not read the 1965 book on which the film is based, so I am unequipped to make comparisons to it.

As for the film, bits of the critical response themselves need critique. Burr, of the Globe, seems disappointed by the movie's `human' element. Sure, the animation technology used did not bring every facial detail to life, but for what was used, it is not that bad. I thought the overall portrayals (facial expressions notwithstanding) appeared to be firmly human. Also, Dargis, of the N.Y. Post, is surely wrong to say that Boy 'dreamed up' the train, as we see him pinch himself while en route, not to mention [SPOILER WARNING! rest of paragraph] a Santa-given souvenir that makes its way to the very end of the movie (literally) the morning after. The film closes us with Boy and his 'awe' or 'wonder' about Santa and the spirit of Christmas ... and the thought (despite presentable illogic) that childlike faith in Santa is in some sense real.

For what I had expected, THE POLAR EXPRESS did not disappoint. A fine product.",1103932800,2,3763,4.745788667687596

'|*REVIEW*|'

Is it with my obligation to watch at least one theatrical film on this holiday season, just to have a little entertainment on this merry month.  I had hoped that there is going to be a Christmas film this year that might brighten up my already-dull and apathetic holiday spirit.  ""The Polar Express"", with all its magic and innocence, didn't do it for me as a spirit-lifter.  However, I was mostly entertained with this movie.

Just to let you know, I didn't read the original picture book the movie was based on, so I'm just going to judge the movie based on the execution alone, not by its adaptation.  In a movie where almost nobody seems to have a first name, it's about the Hero Boy who does not have the spirit of Christmas and doesn't believe in Santa Claus, due to the harsh actualization of the season.  His frown would soon to be turned upside-down when a train stop at his house at night.  The Hero Boy got close to the train where he met a Conductor who told the boy about The Polar Express that goes to the north pole, and that the boy was the train's last stop to pick.  Going from uncertainty to curiosity at the last minute, the boy decides to hop on for the ride of his life.  With his new friends, the black Hero Girl and the Know-it-all who doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, he's on a train ride to a magical place that could teach him to believe and to understand the true meaning of Christmas.

Usually, I lengthen my reviews to give details on the pluses and minuses of movies and so forth, but since this Christmas, and people like to relax without a hint of stress in Christmas, I'm gonna keep this short.  ""The Polar Express"" looks amazing and so whimsical, but this new ""Performance Capture"" technique could've been perfect if the characters don't look so dead-in-the-eyes; maybe THAT'S why people find this movie's spooky.  Like every G-rated cartoon films of yesteryear, sing-alongs are necessary here; fortunately, there's little of them in this movie, and they weren't so over-the-top, even if Steven Tyler`s singing number got me in an awkward mood.  Tom Hanks, as always, did a fantastic job playing not only the Conductor, but the Hobo, Santa Claus, and surprisingly, the boy (thank goodness for audio effects).  Now if the movie was just as fantastic as his acting.  I like the movie, but this film could've be more astonishing than what it is.  First, the movie became reliant with perilous scene after perilous scene, and while they are fun to see, they become tedious.  Second, it's a little too predictable for its own good.  Finally, and the rotten eggnog of problems, I thought this movie would be more than just a Christmas movie; a movie that can stand alone to the masterpieces of cinema.  ""The Polar Express"" is a typical Santa-esque Christmas movie in its own restricted fault, and with its magical appeal, the kids would obvious love it, though I doubt parents would find anything significant in this movie, other than to relieve some childhood memory.

THE FINAL WORD: Joyride.  Watching ""The Polar Express"" is like riding a roller coaster: they're intense and fun to experience, and while it's something you want to experience it again, you pretty much know what you're gonna get.  The movie looks beautiful, but it can't stack the profound quality like ""It's A Wonderful Life.""  However, I'm still gonna recommend this movie, because it's great for what it is: a family-fun holiday flick.  Watch it not as a classic, but just watch it for yuletide enjoyment.",1103846400,,3737,4.701996927803379

The artists obviously spent a long time getting the eyes right and are not at all reticent about showing off their work. The city at the North Pole can only be described as an example of benevolent fascism. I also worried probably too much, as this is just an animated movie, about OSHA guidelines up there at the North Pole. Finally, the movie is a lovely thing to look at and tells a sweet story about childlike faith, but there's a rub as well. Should I continue to support the Santa falsehood with my children? Isn't this movie more Santa propaganda, that we as adults know is false? Isn't it morally wrong to lie to our children, and to be complicit in propagating this lie? In the end, this movie supports the concept of discarding fact (the boy has collected evidence for the lack of a Santa early in the film) in favor of ""belief"". Hmmm. Perhaps it was intended to be a parable of our times, where faith and belief are regarded as virtues in and of themselves and the questioning of such is discouraged.",1103760000,2,1181,4.422018348623853

2343218,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I had mixed emotions about the prospects of this movie.

I love the book. I never like seeing a book be made into a movie--even when the movies are well done.

Add into the mix my general liking of Forest Gump and CastAway, the two previous Hanks/Zemeckis films (I feel CastAway is the far superior film if anyone's interested).

Temper that general feeling of goodwill with the fact that Tom Hanks's last piece of GREAT acting (in my opinion) was in Joe vs the Volcano (Meg Ryan's as well)--and that CastAway was Zemeckis's last good film.

These ingredients, as well as knowing that this film was to be a guinea pig for a new kind of animation, left me feeling unsettled at best about going to see The Polar Express.

Yet...

This movie blew me away.

Say what you want about The Passion of the Christ or Fahrenheit 911 (both are great movies in the movie-making sense and should be nominated for all kinds of awards) but this is my movie of the year. It is also the best Christmas movie in quite a while.

The movie version of The Polar Express has a whole lot to see. This is serious eye-candy. That said, the movie stays incredibly faithful to the heart of the book.

The book and the movie are all about the wonder and joy of belief.

I could go on and on about the great job Tom Hanks does, about the awesome animation, but I won't. For as gilded and bedecked with ornaments as this movie is, it all gets stripped down to the ringing of a silver bell.

The sound of belief.

Faith is the evidence of things not yet seen.

This movie is a wonderful hymn to that evidence. An evidence readily found in all hearts brave enough to believe.

I give the Polar Express my highest recommendation.",1103500800,247,1695,4.373801916932908
2343219,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I'm beginning to learn not to trust in previews to give me an accurate sample of what a movie might have to offer, because I've had several movies fail to deliver on preview-induced expectations. I don't think my expectations were terribly high; a warm fuzzy Christmas movie that would be on DVD within a few months, and would become part of the essential holiday viewing, alongside Frosty and Rudolph. Unfortunately, the movie didn't come through. I felt like I'd been on two or three roller coasters, and had been left out of much of the Christmas magic.

PLOT: As you might have heard, two of the three main kids are never named. There is the primary boy (sometimes called Hero Boy,  but I'd call him Doubting Thomas) and the young girl he meets on the train (hereinafter referred to as the Believing Girl) and the somewhat disillusioned boy for whom ""Christmas just hasn't worked out."" All three are invited onboard the Polar Express by The Conductor (Tom Hanks) for a round-trip visit to the North Pole to have their Christmas beliefs confirmed. (Except, the Believing Girl never seems to have lost her faith, so I wonder why she was on board)

GOOD: There is a good deal of Christmas warmth and fuzzy -- but it's kind of scattered. Any movie whose landscape is dominated by lovely, fluffy white snow is somehow attractive, and there's plenty of it to be found. There is a strong message of belief and trust in unseen things, or as the Conductor puts it, ""sometimes the most real things in the world are the things you can't see."" The music is a definite plus, with the sweeping choir lending splendor to the North Pole. (And for Josh Groban fans, his ""Believe"" song is featured in the end credits)

BAD/OBJECTIONABLE: I can't necessarily say there is anything BAD per se about this movie, but in several ways, it failed to live up to expectations. There seemed to be a lot of needless foreboding in the film. Hero boy/Doubting Thomas encounters several different dangers, perils and oddments while traveling to the North Pole, including meeting a phantasmal hobo stowaway on the train's roof who is kind of creepy, which happens while he is trying to catch up with a girl who he's been told is going to be thrown off the train, being grabbed by what appears to be the same ghostly apparition for an adrenaline-pumping race on skis down the train as it plummets down a dip in the tracks, very nearly falling off the train, thinking he's about to crash into a mountainside, and being scared by creepy, retired toys in one train car when the wraithlike hobo takes up the strings of one marionette and begins scaring him. As well, he is also frightened when the train skids across a giant lake of ice which has encroached on the tracks. The train is nearly submerged before grasping the tracks. He becomes stuck on board a runaway train car, falls and starts sliding down an enormous chute, and precariously inches his way across a train trestle, perched over miles of empty space. He and his companions then wander through eerily vacant and abandoned areas of the North Pole while trying to rejoin their group. Even the elves (who behave more like they're at a political rally than sending Big Red on his way -- you'd think they get enough of the Big Guy during the year) seem sinister or creepy.

All of this might potentially frighten youngsters, but also detracts from the magical Christmas spirit that one would expect, leaving you feeling more like you have to catch your breath than snuggle tight those you love. The entire first twenty minutes or so of danger and intrigue while traveling to the North Pole seem absolutely pointless, not to mention wandering. There is some thematic material regarding belief/ non-belief in Santa which some choosy parents may wish to avoid. I think the emphasizing of belief is a good thing, but not when the whole ""belief"" part is contingent to children being taken to the North Pole before their beliefs can be confirmed.

THOUGHTS: There were mixed reviews when this film first came out, and now I understand why. I have mixed feelings about the film myself. At times, you're checking your watch and curious why you're sitting there. Then once some of the Christmas magic (perhaps at its strongest with Matthew Hall and Meagan Moore's ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" song) begins to set in, you're hooked. But then moments come along which snap you out of it, and then you're pulled right back in again; a very up-and-down cycle. Hero boy/Thomas seems left out of a lot of the feeling of magic at the North Pole until the very end, and since we're primarily from his perspective, we're left out as well. I would almost rather have seen it from Believing Girl's point of view, to capture more of the belief and spirit of Christmas.

As far as the animation goes, excellent job all the way around, with only a few moments where the character seemed stoic or unrealistic.

I think any movie should have you talking about it afterwards, but I'm afraid all my siblings and I could do was discuss the upcoming Narnia film.

Conclusion: Mixed feelings, but if you think you want to see it after what you've read, then you'd probably want to.",1103328000,3,5180,4.677277716794731

PM 1225 was built right after the PM 1224 and right before the PM 1226, both of which went to the scrapyard long ago, along with most of the other obsolete steam trains in America.

Decades ago, when all other steam trains were being sent to the scrapyard, the PM 1225 train (now living in Owosso, MI, in a small railyard) was saved. The man who was scrapping the engines was told that he could save ONE engine. He chose to save the 1225 because he liked the number. Go figure...

40 years later, the people who were making the Polar Express were looking around America for a steam train to use as a model for the animation in the film. There are VERY FEW of these magnficant machines left.

The men from Hollywood heard about a working steam train in Owosso, Michigan which had been saved from the scrapyard and renovated by a volunteer group, the Michigan State Trust for Railway Preservation...(MSTRP)

Hollywood animators and film scouts came and looked at it and asked to use it. MSTRP was thrilled to have their beloved vintage train starring in a movie with Tom Hanks and said yes.

It was only later that the animators found out that the rare vintage train, saved from the scrapyard and chosen to model the ""Polar Express"" was named ""1225.""

I had no idea what impact it had on me. This movie is one of the better Santa movies in recent years. I would recomend this movie to children of ALL ages!

Well, the book has been in my family since then.  I am 21 and do not have any children and plan to have both the book and the beautiful movie follow them as well.

The Story line:

A young boy follows his hopes that Santa and Christmas aren't just a fairy tale story passed on since before he was born.  He boards a magical train where he meets many a wonderful character.

He arrives at the North Pole with his new friends and finds himself truly believing in Santa Claus.  He is given the first gift of Christmas which is a bell from Santa's sleigh.  The only thing is, he must truly believe to hear it's sweet magical ring.

Does he find out?

Yeah, all of us don't believe in santa anymore. But after watching this flick, you guys are totally gonna expect santa to come down your chimney on Christmas eve. :) This movie is filled with touching scenes and little christmas miracles we never even believed possible. And the special effects were totally awesome! The scenes were so beautiful and the colors were all so vibrant and lively :)

This is a story about a boy who has doubts about believing in Santa Claus but then on Christmas Eve, the polar express suddenly stopped over his house and invited him to go on the journey to the Polar Express. As the journey continues, he makes new friends, witnesses little Christmas miracles, realizes important lessons and little by little, he starts to believe.

The main message of the movie is that the Christmas spirit really lies inside those who truly believe. Those who truly want Christmas to be beautiful no matter what. Like what the train director once said in the movie, ""Seeing may be believing. But sometimes, the most real things in this world are the things we cannot see."" It goes something like that. So as long as the true spirit of christmas lies in your heart, you'll always find a way to believe.

2343230,4,B0009XRZ9M,"As to its stunning visuals, we can see no disagreement among us.  'The Polar Express' has shown where the CGIs would be leading us in the future.  However, as to its story and, well, the virtual star Tom Hanks (who looks and moves in a very weird way), there is still room for improvement to be done.  All in all I liked the film simply because I love to see newer things on the big screen.  But if you are kind of audiences who would feel dizzy after watching the flood of CGIs, you may consider buying the original book (and that's beautiful) instead.

The original book by Chris Van Allsburg contains only 29 pages, and for the film (that runs 100 mins), Robert Zemeckis stretched the story.  Maybe he did it too much, but anyway the film follows one boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, the kid of 'The Spy Kids') who lost his faith in Santa.  But one Christmas Eve, an old-fashioned train led by a steam locomotive stops right in front of his window.  It's The Polar Express, and The Conductor invites him to board the train to join in the travel to the North Pole.

The rest of the story needs no summery; The Hero Boy meets new friends, sees the elves (including one cameo played by Steven Tyler), and, yes, the man in red clothes, with white beard.  The voice cast include Tom Hanks (playing five roles), Michael Jitter (playing two roles Smokey and Steamer), Norah Gaye as Hero Girl, and Peter Scolari as Lonely Boy.

But the merit of the film is mostly the visuals (not those of humans, which, quite annoyingly, often look embalmed bodies in motion).  The snow-covered railroad track, the icy field on which the train slips as if skating, and the well-crafted designs of the town in the North Pole are all fantastic.  If only Tom Hanks appeared exactly as he is, without tampered by the 'performance capture' system (whatever it is).

The sound effects are amazing, the songs are pretty good, but the fact remains that 'The Paolar Express' is based on a very thin book -- you know what I mean if you remember 'Jumanji' which was another film based on Chrs Van Allsburg's book.  Great images with very few things to say, that's my verdict.  And very bizarre Tom Hanks, more bizarre than him in 'The Ladykillers.'",1102377600,,2213,4.508771929824562
2343231,5,B0009XRZ9M,"The POLAR EXPRESS is the picture of the year in IMAX 3-D.  I can't imagine how it might look any other way.  The compositions would be the same, but the dimensionality of the movie really floors you, knocks you out, and I think perhaps the 3-effects help you enjoy Alan Silvestri's music more, even down to the magical sleighbells that our little hero cannot hear.

The songs are to be cherished.  I couldn't make out the lyrics of the choral number, ""The Spirit of the Season,"" but it is something I would like to have the choir in my church sing during their rehearsals for the Nutcracker Suite.  One of my favorite music numbers is the bizarre, minimal ""Hot Chocolate"" barked out by Tom Hanks and a chorus of singing waiters in a take off of an old Cotton Club/Cab Calloway style.  Hanks really doesn't have a good singing voice, does he, and he's straining himself trying to get through a number even where all he has to say is, ""Hot, hot,"" a dozen times.  In general when Hanks was off the screen I liked the movie better.  I couldn't help but think that he was hogging up all the action by trying to put his brand on every male character in the show, right down to the evil Scrooge puppet, and trying to play one character and the father to that character is stupid, if you ask me, but they say Warner Brothers paid him $25 million dollars to play in the show, so maybe they figured they would milk him for all he's worth.  Peter Sellers used to play many characters-and Alec Guinness-I didn't like it when they did it either, to tell you the truth.

Steven Tyler from Aerosmith has a few cute moments as an elf singing, ""Rocking On Top Of The World.""

The movie has you in tears from approximately 40:15 on.  When the little black girl and the poor boy who's afraid of Christmas disappointment, get together at the back of the club car and sing, ""When Christmas Comes To Town,"" it is the signal to unleash all the tears you've ever wanted to shed about the world's injustice and also the beauty of the world that the young girl seems to be arguing in favor of.

2343232,3,B0009XRZ9M,"Okay, so G-rated does not truly mean the movie is for everyone.  My three year old got through it okay, but, believe it or not, found Polar Express more frightening than the Scooby Doo 2 movie.

For adults, this is a typical feel-good story that grapples with the 7-10 year old crowd's struggle between no longer believing in fairy tales, but continuing to believe in the magic of life.  The protaganist does learn to BELIEVE--but believe what?  Viewers can make up their own answers, but, my sense is he's to have faith in life and love and the notion that good begets good.  Ultimately, Polar Express complies obediently to the Walt Disney doctrine:  All magic, no religion.

On the positive side:  The other children's characters are realistic, and it's good to see the bright but uncertain young girl learn to lead, and the know-it-all kid learn to follow.  The poor child who, at far too young an age, becomes cynical, finally finds goodness.  This is sweet stuff.

Bottom-line:  Polar express is the ultimate mediocre Christmas tale.  It has good but obvious lessons to teach, fun graphics, and a fair level of action.  It's a bit much for the under six crowd.  There's so much to choose from in the Christmas movie genre, that this one probably deserves a pass.

Tom Hanks was wonderful as the conductor, and as the hobo too.  He is a talented performer and keeps proving this time and again, especially in the Polar Express.

I got caught up in the characters and they became real to me.  The one little boy who experienced the Christmas spirit for the first time really tore at our heartstrings.  I thought it was beautifully done.  The story line to me was very deep.  Caprturing the very essence of Christmas - our hearts.  It was also very suspenseful during the action sequences.

Our children aged 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 did not like it as well.  I think they were too young.  Our son, now 4 1/2 has been able to sit through a full feature film since he was very young, but it was the first time we brought our daughter to the theatre as she is a very high energy child.  Both of our children sat peaceably throughout, but both were sad afterward.  The movie does carry a sad and eerie feel which proved to be unsettling for our two.  I didn't see any reviews regarding children's ages and opinions, but I think we would have brought them anyway.

This will definitely be a movie we will purchase when it is available, but it will not compare to seeing it on the big screen.

2343237,5,B0009XRZ9M,"A criticism leveled at a currently running holiday movie, CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS, is that Jesus is mentioned nowhere in the plot. THE POLAR EXPRESS, a much superior film, doesn't either. (Just so you know if you care about such things.) THE POLAR EXPRESS is all about childhood belief in Santa Claus and getting presents. If, like me, you don't particularly care much anymore (Bah humbug!) about Santa and presents, the film represents an extraordinary achievement in animation and motion-capture technology. And, it's great fun.

The plot is simple. On Christmas Eve, a young boy finds himself doubting the existence of Santa even as he gazes at the ornamented tree and the cookies and moo laid out for jolly St. Nick. He goes to sleep suspecting that Dad is the real benefactor. In any case, he's awakened in the middle of the night by the steam-belching locomotive of the Polar Express, which has pulled to a stop in the street. After some initial hesitation, our young hero climbs aboard for a wild ride to the North Pole where his belief in Santa may (or may not) be resurrected.

This film, insofar as it uses real actors to provide the voiceovers and the substrate for the motion-capture effects, is virtually a one man show for Tom Hanks, who ""plays"" the Boy Hero, his father, the train's conductor, a mysterious hobo, a Scrooge puppet, and Santa himself. (The Boy Hero's voice is provided by Daryl Sabra. Tom doesn't do soprano.) You'd think the Screen Actor's Guild would protest the reduction in actors required to meet casting requirements.

As an exercise in motion-capture, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an intriguing glimpse at what may be the future of the motion picture industry. As seen in this film, they haven't quite yet got the technique down perfect. The human movements are faintly unnatural - perhaps a greater concentration of motion sensors are needed on the real life actor's skin. And the eyes are sometimes downright creepy. (If my wife showed up with such orbs, I'd search the Yellow Pages for ""exorcist"".) The animation of the animals in the film is, however, superlative, as evidenced by a breathtaking sequence of a running pack of wolves that left me positively delighted.

I'm awarding five stars for the incredibly detailed visuals. It's a small thing, but I was entranced, for example, by the swirling vortices of ice flakes created by the train's passage through a snowstorm as framed by the rear door of the last passenger car. I find it amazing and commendable that the film's creators would think to include such an esoteric detail.

It's been predicted in some quarters that THE POLAR EXPRESS will become a Yuletide season classic. That it would ever replace IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is doubtful. Tom Hanks, as phenomenal as he is, is no Jimmy Stewart. And THE POLAR EXPRESS doesn't have even a fraction of the warm fuzziness. But the latter is at the top of its genre, as I'm sure the next Oscar awards will recognize.",1101859200,,2954,4.818540433925049

The Polar Express proves that the Teflon-coated, post-Bonfire of the Vanities career of Tom Hanks is starting to shred its protective lining. After the so-so Ladykillers and the sugary The Terminal, Hanks bonded again with gumpy buddy Robert Zemeckis to turn (or, ""Potterize"") a lovely Christmas story into an overblown commercial for books, toys video games and tree ornaments.

When you figure out the story of The Polar Express, you realize that it would have worked better as a shorter TV movie. The main character, a young boy called ""boy,"" is at the age when his belief in Santa Claus fades. On Christmas Eve a magical passenger train, the you-know-what express. appears outside his house, and he is whisked away to the North Pole to meet the one and only Jolly Fat Man.

Zemeckis, a semi-delusional special effects wonk (Death Becomes Her, oh, you forgot about that film already...) decided to use motion capture to create actors that could pass for, well, above average video game targets. Hanks is cast as five characters: the boy, his father, the conductor, Santa Claus and a magical train hobo who was neither in the book nor adds anything to the heart of the story.

The look of the film is spectacular, but then Zemeckis had the wonderful book illustrations to scan in and Photoshop scenes from. The motion capture work is amazing, and that may be this film's only saving grace. It's too much of a roller-coaster ride and too little of a heartfelt journey.",1101772800,10,1479,4.811023622047244

2343240,2,B0009XRZ9M,"A milestone in cinema computer animation production. However, with all the technology, the bottom line of any film is an interesting and original storyline.  THE POLAR EXPRESS is wrought with predictability and dullness.  The audience knows the train is headed for the north pole to end up at Santa's villiage and work shop. The audience knows the main character is going to hop on the train, meet up with a bunch of precocious children (Eddie Deezen's --1941, GREASE, I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND-- annoying voice is the most recognizable of the bunch)and other uninteresting characters (i.e. the train conductor, the hobo etc). The audience knows that somehow the main child character will end up meeting Santa Clause and change his disbelief. Lastly, the plot device of whether this is a dream or reality is a tired cliche done in movies from THE WIZARD OF OZ to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To get back to the technology and animation technique, it takes its look from a children's story book by Chris Van Allsburg. Then the actor's motion and facial expressions are transcribed into a computer program and given the cgi treatment etc. However, it looks haunting, dark, and creepy especially once the Polar Express reaches Santa's village and the townspeople and elves appear.  It looks like a bunch of people being sent off to concentration camps. Overall...Overrated!! Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have a pretty good track record of great films, but this is a vanity project that falls short of its promise.",1101686400,7,1502,4.9523809523809526
2343241,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This is one of the best movies of the year. Not only does it have a heartfelt story, but it is visually amazing. The other computer generated image movies that came out this year were ""Shrek 2"" and ""The Incredibles."" The difference between the three movies is that ""The Polar Express"" took of picture of Tom Hanks, who plays about five different parts, and then they animated the picture of it. The people characters all look realistic, and the movie could give the impression of a life action film. What I love about animation is that you can do anything, and this movie creates it's own world. It reminded me of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Instead of a girl, it was a boy, and he enters a magic land full of new adventures and new friends. ""The Polar Express"" is also based on a children's book of the same name. I never read the book, or heard of it before the movie came out, but I heard that the movie is as good as the book. It is hard to make a movie version of a 40 page book, and alot of people were disappointed with the movie version of ""The Cat in the Hat."" I'll have to look in the store for this book and flip through it there. Tom Hanks is having a very good year, with ""The Ladykillers"" and ""The Terminal"" all getting five stars from me. I just wanted to take in all of this animation, and enter this world, and I haven't been so impressed with animation since last years ""Finding Nemo."" I'm just looking forward for the next technological leap in animation.

The movie begins with the young Hero Boy sleeping in his bed, waiting for Santa. He is at that age where he is beginning to doubt if Santa is real or not. As he is lying in bed, a train pulls up in front of the house, and The Conductor asks if he is coming on board. Hesitating, the boy gets on and meets the Hero Girl, and the Know It All. Know It All is that kind of kid where everything that he says sounds like he thinks he is better than everybody else. He probably doesn't mean it, but he gives that impression. They are going to the North Pole, for it is Christmas Eve, and on the way, after picking up young Billy, they go through many adventures, including riding on ice, going down Glaciar Gulp, which is the steepest mountain in the North Pole, and finally making it to the North Pole. Along the way, the Hero Boy also meets the Hobo who lives on the top of the train, who is a ghost that whenever he disappears, one of his hands always lingers. When they make it to the North Pole, it's not all smooth sailing, and they meet the elves, who run a very tight organized layout, and get to see the Christmas Eve ceremony.

""The Polar Express"" is always entertaining, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. I have to compare it to ""The Incredibles"" because that is the other big animated movie of the season. ""The Polar Express"" is Rated G, as opposed to the PG that ""The Incredibles"" has, but this movie is much more darker. There is not a bright tropical island, with the little boy fighting other super villians, instead it is a much more sober tale about believing. The Hero Boy doesn't really believe, and I loved the way to believe. The Boy doesn't get all the perks that everybody else does. For example, he can't hear the sleigh bells, because he doesn't really believe that they are there. He believes he is in a dream for a short period of time. I found this movie to be more entertaining than ""The Incredibles"" and much more visually stunning, even though I gave both movies five stars. Tom Hanks played the voice over of the Hero Boy, The Hobo, The Conductor, The Boy's father, and even Santa Claus himself. This is the best Christmas movie of the year as well, and beats ""Surviving Christmas"" and ""Christmas with the Kranks"" combined. I wanted to thank every person in the credits personally. The slight thing I didn't like was when Hero Girl and Billy had to sing that sappy Christmas song. It did slow the movie down a little, kind of like ""If I Were the King of the Forest"" in ""The Wizard of Oz."" It broke the mood of the story, and if that was cut I wouldn't have minded.

I saw ""The Polar Express"" twice. I saw it on opening day on the regular screen, and then I decided to see it on IMAX, otherwise I would have reviewed this already. I recommend the IMAX version more. It is on a much bigger screen, and it is in 3D. It was like riding a roller coaster, and I was able to study the animation more clearly with the crystal clear screens. I don't wear my glasses often, but I can see that the 3D glasses were much more bigger to cover the glasses as well. It was great seeing some of my favorite scenes on the IMAX, including the journey of the train ticket over mountain, and in a birds nest, and especially the train riding on the ice, I won't say anymore. I loved the music of the movie, as well, and it provded such a sweet and sad undertone, which touches the heart of the movie. I wanted to cry during the very last line of the movie, both times I saw it. It's very happy, but subtitling sad, and it was then when I knew that ""The Polar Express"" would be close to the top of the Best of 2004.

ENJOY!

The 3d effects are the best I've seen so far, and this film makes very good use of IMAX technology.  I then saw it about a week later in an ordinary movie theater.  Good, but it wasn't even the same experience as in IMAX.  When the train comes, the IMAX theater shook.  See this movie, it's a christmas classic.  And if at all possible, see it in IMAX 3D, it's well worth the trip.  IMAX 3D brings out the best in this film.",1101513600,,506,3.9504950495049505

I actually felt tears streaming down my cheeks during some parts of the movies. When the two children are singing ""when christmas comes to town"" I actually felt chills on my neck and spine. It's just one of those movies that give you the good feeling. I would definatley see it 100 more times if i had to. It's just such a great movie I can't even put it all in words.

2343244,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I've never read the book but was intrigued enough by the promos to take my 5 yr old nephew, who just happens to love Santa and trains. His mother (my sister) and grandfather (my father) came along for the ride. Our venue was a stadium seating theatre with surround sound.

The story is unusual in that it is full of symbolism, often times feels like a dream with the wild (acrobat dancers) mixed with the thrilling (train ride) and a touch of the scary (marrionnette car), sadly sweet (little girl and poor boy duet), and mysterious (Hobo).

The sound and visual effects are amazing. In a crowded theatre, you could still hear the soft hiss of the radiator while the boy tries to sleep on Christmas Eve. And the sound of the train coming reminds one of the infamous Jurassic Park scene causing ripples on water. The visuals are just mindboggling.

Now some caveats: the sound and sights can be very intense for first time young viewers. My nephew did get scared in a few parts, especially during the Marrionnette car and some of the train racing. Yet he couldn't make himself leave the theatre chosing to hide in the entrance aisle and come back for more. Many kids in the audience cheered, with some even singing along to the story.

After buying the soundtrack cd (another great addition till the DVD comes out), I only have more appreciation for the film.

Polar Express is an adventure for all those kids who aren't quite sure about Santa anymore.

And those Grinch's who don't believe just don't get the meaning of the story. Ignore them and take your family, or go treat the child within you this season. It will bring back your love of toy trains, waiting up for Santa, and wishing dreams could really be trusted to come true.",1101340800,,1733,4.574193548387097

All of them have unique personalities.  That is part of the beauty of this movie.  The characters are not clones of each other.  They each have unique qualities about them.  You really get to know who they are throughout the movie.  I also like how the brilliant, yet impatient and selfish boy gets taught the lesson that he needs to learn.  Billy learns that he now has people he can count on in his life.  The little girl realizes that she is a leader (an honest leader, too).  The main boy learns how to believe, which is something we all need, not necessarily for believing in Santa Claus, but we all need to know how to do that and not get overly sceptical.

2343247,3,B0009XRZ9M,"""The Polar Express"" is the story of an unnamed boy who does not believe in Santa anymore.  On Christmas Eve night, while lying in bed, hears a train outside his window.  When goes outside to see what it is, he finds the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole.  So begins his adventure.  Along the way, he will meet other children, a mysterious hobo, and have some amazing adventures, before arriving at the North Pole in time to see Santa off on the busiest night of his year.

""The Polar Express"" is both impressive and disappointing at the same time.  The characters are animated using motion capture performance, mostly done by Tom Hanks.  The characters look somewhat real, but are just enough off to look creepy at times (specifically the little girl, the elves, and the waiters).  The movements seem a little odd at times, and that is difficult to explain because they are based on real movements.  Perhaps it is just the animation.  The overall animation is impressive though.  The Polar Express and North Pole are fully realized in all their glorious detail.

The songs are unmemorable, but the performances by Tom Hanks are good.  He gives life to numerous characters, some of them children, in such a way that you believe that they seem real and true to their age.  The story has been modified from the book in order to accomidate a longer running time, and it works to some extent.  The movie moves swiftly for the most part.

In the end, ""The Polar Express"" will probably become a childrens' holiday classic.  I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.",1101081600,2,1694,4.6120401337792645
2343248,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I took my 7 year old son to see this movie today, and there was a point in the movie where I had ""that feeling.""  This is a feeling I don't often get watching a movie.  It is hard to describe it, but I know that the next time, and every other time I see that spot in the film, this thrill will return.  The last time I got that thrill was when I saw ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and I got to the scene at the Bridge at Khazad Dum.  This feeling can only be evoked in me when image, music, story converge into memorable wonder.

For me, this was a true Christmas movie.  The spirit of the film was beyond the commercialism that holiday fare has, of late, become, which is ironic since it uses technology at the cutting edge.  Reviews I have read seem to call it a failure because of its creepiness of characters, vagueness, sublime underscore of terror.  I believe it was a success because of these things.  I remember reading an article by Maurice Sendak, author of the ""Wild Things"" books, where he criticized modern children's book writers for forgetting the terror that is part of childhood, the terror that folk stories still remember, but our modern, psychologist-approved TV and books deny or try to sugar over.

In this movie, the children are at the edge of danger constantly; critics rebuke the movie for this.  Indeed they are; as young children are.  These are beings who have not yet found that there can be a stability in life because there hasn't been enough of it for them to trust a stability.  They don't have enough experience to understand that you can depend on the tracks to be there.  It is a rollercoaster ride; a tightrope walk.  The lead character is taken back to that uncertain childhood; the skeptic who has begun questioning his beliefs is taken back to this wild terror, and through it finds belief.  Zemekis is smart in that he acknowledges that it is a dream, but he doesn't make a big deal about the line between dream and reality.  Is there really that big a wall between the two?  For a child, a believer, there is not.

One of the many amazing scenes in here is when the three leads walk along the rail line, above a bottomless plunge.  And Zemekis is smart enough to make this scene silent: no scary music, no pumped up fear shots.  The kids simply walk the rail, arms out for balance, knowing there is no safety net, yet they do it.  That is childhood too.  They deeply fear the terror of death, but they don't fully understand it either, as we adults do.

And yes, the kids have no names.  They are not meant to.  There is a deep allegorical element to this story.  The boy of the mid-20th century who has become a skeptic to magic in life?  The industrial/almost-facist nature of the North Pole factory?  The elf within the camp-like factory who subtly throws in a Yiddish word?  The black female child whose ticket is lost by the white boy and is sent out of the passenger car, whose challenge it is to lead?  I am sure you can find more allegorical examples of the roots of the later 20th century and our loss of wonder and belief.

If you go to this movie merely to measure the accuracy of the special effects, you may nitpick details like the lifeless eyes, the miffed body movements, etc., but you will be missing the point of this movie.  For children, the wolves are always howling just outside the window, following the careening train through the ride to adulthood.  Most adults successfully negotiate this ride, and abandon those fears as silly childhood nonsense.  Some of us realize the magic is tied in with that terror, and realize belief is both a spiritual wonder and a breathless terror.",1100908800,4,3641,4.4568835098335855

At points, you could have heard a pin drop, they were so involved with the movie.  They loved the ""rollercoaster effect"" and the adventure scenes on the train, some gasping out loud during the action.

The special animation of the film just adds to the magical dream-like since of disbelief (or belief!).  As the story is a children's classic, it is as if the book has come to life and thrust you into the story. As an adult, I was continuously  blown away with the detail of the artwork and little subtle nuances throughtout the film.

I believe this film is destined to become a beautiful Christmas classic.  It's the kind of film both an adult and a child can equally enjoy.  I envision yearly Christmas screenings of The Polar Express at IMAX theaters with families returning year after year for a family treat.

As of this writing, ""The Incredibles"" is getting all the attention and box office bucks, but if you want to experience a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, wondrous and magical experience, please, please do not hesitate to see this film in 3D on the biggest Imax screen you an find.

There's no doubt in my mind that this awesomely beautiful, painterly, digital creation was designed for 3D.  When you put on your polarizing 3D glasses (no red/blue lenses) and the movie starts with the 3D Castle Rock logo, you will be transported to another time and place. And not only that, the incredible feeling of transcendant magic that you always hope will happen in movies but seldom does will stay with you for the duration of this truly amazing film. And hours afterward...

Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks had a vision for something that we have never seen before and they delivered.  It's not just the idea but the extraordinary execution. If Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated but static story is simple, the seductive power of the expanded, detailed, moving images is huge.  And the theme about Doubt and the Gift of Believing in what seems too good to be true IS of course the heart of the Christmas story.

Other reviewers (jealous gremlins from Pixar?) have mentioned the animated kids look like ""zombies with dead eyes.""  I didn't see that at all.

The 3D digital version is very much like Van Allsburg's illustrations.  And the powerful steam locomotive has real mass and inertia as it drives the story on its dangerous route to the North Pole and the huge, fabled city where millions of elves serve a mighty but kindly Father Christmas.  This Santa is no department store joke. (But who or what is the hobo on the train? Could he be Santa in another guise?)

I can't wait to see it again and sit back as the huge, shimmering, crystal clear fully 3D images come to life in the space between my eyes and the screen, enveloping me in a world of wonder unlike anything I have experienced at the movies.  And the great, inventive sound mix and music score (except for one song) on the 15,000 Watt Imax true surround sound system are an aural delight that perfectly enhances the 3D visuals.

I'm sure the 2D version looks just fine. But the real magic only happens on the big Imax screen in 3D.

See this film and you will understand why the future of movies has arrived.  An absolute barrier has been broken where ancient art and new technology perfectly merge.  Now for certain, you can make real -- or should I say ""reel""? -- anything you can dream.

2343262,4,B0009XRZ9M,"A film by Robert Zemeckis

""The Polar Express"" is based on a 29 page award winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  Robert Zemeckis obviously had to expand Van Allsburg's book, but he still begins with the first line of the book and ends with the last line.  ""The Polar Express"" is animation like we have never seen before, using a movement capture technology which has advanced far beyond anything that has come before.

Hero Boy (Tom Hanks) has lost his faith in Christmas.  He has told his sister that there is no Santa Claus, and while he still wants to believe that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and delivers presents to all the good little boys and girls, he knows from his encyclopedia that the North Pole is barren with no life.  He goes to sleep on Christmas Eve but is woken in the middle of the night by the sound of a train outside his window.  He puts on his jacket and runs outside and sees a big train in the middle of the street with a Conductor (Tom Hanks) ""all aboard!""  The train, the Polar Express, is headed to the North Pole and Hero Boy is on the list of passengers.  After a moment's hesitation, Hero Boy decides to take the trip.

All of the other kids on the train believe that they are truly going to the North Pole to see Santa Claus, but Hero Boy is not so sure.  Despite the magic of a train pulling up to his house in the middle of the night taking him on a wonderous trip, he doesn't believe.  He does befriend Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), however, and after losing her ticket by mistake, Hero Boy has a small adventure on the train trying to find the ticket and then trying to find Hero Girl.

Much of ""The Polar Express"" takes place on the train until it reaches the North Pole, so the scope of the adventure is small.  But, this is a very visual movie and anytime the movie takes a peek outside the windows of the train it is absolutely stunning.  The animation looks more than real.  Everything is extra sharp and beautiful.  The only trouble is with the human characters.  While these are perhaps the best animated human characters (better than ""Final Fantasy""), they still look a little bit creepy in the face.  They move well, but their faces are not exceptionally expressive and look a bit dead at times.  While the partial creepiness lasts throughout the movie, it takes a backseat to the physical beauty of the animation and the enjoyment of the movie.

The voice talent in ""The Polar Express"" all does a very good job.  Tom Hanks, who performs as Hero Boy, The Conductor, The Hobo, Santa Claus, the Father, and Scrooge is excellent as always.  Nona Gaye is perfect in her role as Hero Girl and I would suggest that she is really the backbone of the movie.  We also get to see Peter Scolari (better known as the guy from ""Bosom Buddies"" who didn't become famous) as the Lonely Boy.

""The Polar Express"" has the potential to be a perennial holiday favorite for years to come.  There is a sweetness and a sadness in this story of a child that is sure to resonate with viewers.  This story gets lost at times in the long, though fun, train voyage to the North Pole.  This movie would, perhaps, be better suited to a shorter television special (though I can't imagine any television producer paying the money to make this movie for tv), but it works in the theatre.

By no means is this a perfect movie, and far too much attention will be paid to how much ""The Polar Express"" cost to make (though it will lead to further innovation and cheaper techniques for other movies to use), but this is a nice, sweet holiday movie.  It is about the spirit of Christmas and holding onto that ""magic"" that is the belief of a child.

So why is this expensive movie so hideously off-target?  Because it has no life, and its vision of Christmas and of the North Pole is of a scary looking place that is cold, distant and has no merriment -- a dreary, hellish, Third-Reich of the North.  And for all of the fuss of the CGI wonderment, only the train, with its rollercoaster thrills, comes to life -- the children and people in this movie look like zombies.  The music is either cheesy, over-the-top new stuff (Hot Chocolate, the strangely uninvolving musical number on the train) or classic Christmas songs that play like music in floating through an old radio on the deserted streets of the North Pole - a place as welcoming as a morgue.  It's a heartless vision that virtually drains the magic from the book, which is elegantly spare and has on its mind only one word: believe. This movie is misguided in nearly every way -- calling into question the artistic judgment of those who created it...what were they thinking?  How can you weave magic without caring about someone, or something?  These characters have no life in their eyes -- and it isn't merely the fault of the animation process (think of any of Disney's classics...the characters are more real than some people!)

I have a low tolerance for cheesy things, but this movie doesn't go there.  There is one moment that gets a little sticky-sweet, with a sappy ballad to go along with it - if you like ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" and ""My Heart Will Go On"", you'll like the song, if not, take a restroom break then. But other than that, the story kept my attention.  This was the first movie in a long time that I didn't notice time passing, and when it ended, I was surprised that an hour and a half had passed. I do HIGHLY reccommend that you see the 3D version, although it might be a little too scary for very young children.  If you wouldn't take your child on a big roller coaster, you might not want to take them to the 3D version.  But GO SEE IT, it's a holiday classic, one that they should show at the IMAX every year.  Oh, and I have been stuck living in the south for 13 years now, but this movie reminded me what it's like to actually have snow falling down on you, the 3D effects were that good.  Just GO SEE IT!",1100476800,8,1175,4.012875536480687
2343266,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I already went to see THE POLAR EXPRESS on 3D IMAX yesterday, and it was visually interesting and more than a little obnoxious. The 3D was fun, for it made it far more worthwhile than it would be otherwise. But I'm not the target audience for the film anyway, for I have little Christmas spirit and don't believe in Santa Claus. But, oh well.

In addition to including all of the major plot points (both of them) from the Chris Van Allsburg book, the film has some pretty spectacular, downright frightening action sequences featuring creepy-looking animated children in constant states of peril.

Those scenes, likely to scare the bejeezus out of smaller kids, are beautifully animated, and, on 3D, I found that it's really cool to watch a runaway train full of bright-eyed children almost collide with a mountain while skidding across a cracking lake of ice.

The main girl character has braids that don't move. She almost gets killed three or four times, dangling from heights and what-not, but always gets saved because the train is ""magic"" and the North Pole is ""magic.""

The main boy character has weird eyes, and he's never given a name. For some reason, he keeps having conversations with a ghost of a hobo on the train - even though no one else acknowledges the ghost and the ghost has little to do with the story, other than communicating to the hero that ""doubt is bad"" or something.

I think he's there just so Tom Hanks gets another character to voice, which seems greedy because he already provides the voice of dozens of characters - from the Conductor to Santa Claus.

The music in this movie, by the way, is completely annoying. My friend and I had that song ""Hot Chocolate"" stuck in our head for seven hours after watching this.",1100476800,7,1745,4.6677524429967425

The polar express is When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.

what makes this movie so great is (eerr) the CGI. The background and the special effects are dazzalling amd sometimes exciting. But the thing is, Though the movie is visually stunning overall, but the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough, and the story is quite...... odd.

There was no heart to this story... no soul to makes us feel warm in our bodies.... but It really exposed the coldness of the movie and litterally coldness of the north pole...

I found this movie quite scary. Santa is scary... the north pole is scary. Wouldn't they have frozen to death?

I don't know... theres something not right about this movie.. ignoring the fact santa clause is evil and BIG AND SCARY RED DEVIL!... BUT!!!!!!!!

Its not the right kind of movie that would score an A+, nor A nor B+ nor B nor C+ nor C nor D+ not D Nor E+ but a nice ""E"".

The reason for such a low score is because this movie does not live up to its trailer.. and it tries to hard to become a nice holiday movie...

heres a funny quote from a reviewer and I agree:

""Now it can be said, Santa Claus is a fascist dictator who likes to kidnap and endanger children so that they can learn the true value of Christmas.""

2343269,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I watched `The Polar Express' yesterday with some of my friends and we all agreed that it was the best Christmas movie we had seen in a long time! This is a movie that anyone from any age group can watch and enjoy.

The story revolves around a young boy who has nearly lost his faith in Santa Claus and the spirit of Christmas. On Christmas Eve, he wakes up at night to find a train, called `The Polar Express' outside his home. The Conductor welcomes him and invites him to go to the North Pole. Although he is still skeptic about the whole trip, he nevertheless enters The Polar Express, and as a result, goes on an unforgettable journey filled with magic and excitement.

I found this movie to be perfect in every way. The animation, to start with, is incredible! The characters seem so life-like, along with the breathtaking scenery that you feel that you are watching a real movie, not an animated one. An immediate scene that comes to my mind is when the train accelerates towards Glacier Gulch, and the conductor, along with the 2 kids, are taken into an unbelievable roller-coaster ride, which made me hold on to my seat as well.  Of course the talents of Tom Hanks add tremendously to the film. He provides the voices for the Boy, the Conductor, the Hobo and Santa Claus so skillfully that he brings the magic of the characters to the screen. Moreover, the background score adds perfectly to the movie throughout including songs such as `When Christmas comes to Town'.

This movie will make you laugh, gasp, feel excited and in the end, leave you with a nice warm feeling inside. If you watch this movie, this holiday season, you will believe!",1100390400,5,1652,4.552188552188552
2343270,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I don't normally write many reviews online but I had to come on and write a quick review about this movie.  Today, I took my 7 year old son to see the Polar Express.  We were both looking forward to it very much and I personally thought it was a well written movie, but....my son went in fully believing and came out with a lot of doubt and a lot of questions to my dismay.  I know that the movie is supposed to make kids with question suddenly believe, but, it did the oposite for us.  It opened his eyes to a lot of things that he hadn't really thought about until he saw it being questioned in the movie.  My advice to parents is that if you bring your kids to the movie, be prepared for the possibility of the doubt coming out of the film.",1100390400,8,743,4.0272108843537415
2343271,1,B0009XRZ9M,"I watched this movie with my family, and after about thirty minutes, I just couldn't figure out why I was still sitting there.  Neither could my three kids.  So we all got up and left and watched another showing of ""The Incredibles"" again.

What a contrast!  In ""The Incredibles"", Pixar deliberately kept to the standard cartoon look in order not to distract from their main focus, which was to create an extremely clever storyline and deeply effecting characters that would just grab hold of the audience.  My vote for the BEST Picture of the Year.

In ""Polar Express"", you have this expensive $165 million high tech movie that seems to be obsessed with pushing the state of the art in computer graphics, over and above any desire to make a movie that somebody would want to watch.  Tom Hanks once again lends his name to an avant-garde project reminiscent of the old Saturday Night Live skit ""Bad Theater"".  Hanks must be having some sort of a mid-life crisis as an actor - as one of the most marketable actors out there right now, he could have his pick of movie projects, and he seems to be stuck in this mode of picking projects simply because they are somehow ground-breaking and new and different.

I have read where people have criticized this movie for having creepy looking kids with ""Dead Eyes"".  This sort of criticism misses the real point.  Every movie with special effects has holes and slightly off mismatches that reveal the fact that special effects were used.  If the movie is engaging enough, you will not notice these mistakes or mismatches.  For example, it took me multiple viewings of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies before I started to pick up on some of the slightly off special effects.

If the movie totally bores you to death, and seems completely pointless to watch, then all of a sudden, these slightly off special effects become the focus of your attention.  This is indeed what happens with ""Polar Express"", quite easily.

When the singing and dancing waiters came out and started slinging hot chocolate to all the kids, all I could think of was that the feet of the waiters didn't seem to be realistically dancing on the floor of the train.  And that's when I realized, wow, I need to get up and leave, this is just getting really bad, I'm starting to focus on the mistakes in the special effects, I could be doing a zillion better things than that.

ARF!  ARF!  To call this movie a dog would be an insult to dogs everywhere.",1100390400,20,2459,4.5963302752293576
2343272,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I just went to see this movie last night and I have to say that this is one outstanding movie and creative production!  This is definitely a movie that you have to experience!  The animation in this movie is just outstanding and the characters look SO real.  I felt like I actually knew the girl in the story, she seemed so realistic, and all the children really.  The mannerisms and facial expressions of the children are so close to what children are really like.  Some of the scenes are just breathtaking.  It is nice that they tried to match the 3D animation with the illustrations in the book so closely.  I can't imagine the work that went into this production and I say kudos to the producers/illustrators of this wonderful family film.  I've heard that this movie is also being shown in 3D Imax theatres and wow that would be fantastic.

The storyline is also very well done and the sound of the bell is symbolic of the belief in Santa Claus.  It is a movie about the belief in the Spirit of Christmas as well.  One of the 4 main characters believes already, one doesn't believe, one has the wrong idea of what Christmas is about (i.e. getting), and the other is disillusioned.  It is neat to see how these characters are developed and how they achieve that belief in Christmas and Santa Claus by the end of the movie.  It is emphasized that the Spirit of Christmas is inside us.

Some of the scenes may be a little frightening for small children.  I found the scene when the train goes on the ice to be a bit scary but maybe this was because I was watching it on a 30 ft. screen!  I think the conductor says 'blazes' a couple of times, and some people may not like the ghost on the train idea or that the children are climbing out of the train (do not to this at home, yikes!).

I am definitely going to see this movie again.  I loved it so much I went out and bought the book and the soundtrack both of which are really outstanding.  The movie has retained the flavour of the book and isn't it great that it is motivating more people to read the book!?  This is not just a movie for children, and if you have a childlike heart you will absolutely love it.

I want to add that because I am a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing, I tried out the Rear Window Captioning as it was available in one theatre.  The person at the customer service desk gave me a reflector on a stick that fit into my cup holder.  The words were in red at the back of the theatre and I could view these in my transparent reflector.  It was difficult to get the right positioning sometimes, but I can see that it could be very helpful for some people.  That is what RWC beside the movie listings means and also sometimes headphones are also available in those theatres as well.",1100390400,3,2764,4.269230769230769
2343273,5,B0009XRZ9M,"This film grabs you from the beginning.  The thing that struck me from the beginning that the difference between this new technology and animation, even modern cgi, was that the people actually moved like people which allowed the suspension of disbelief right from the start.  What this caused was my total immersion in the world the film creates, without distraction by disbelief in the characters.  The beautiful story, which retains the spirit of the book, compares favorably with some of the great all ages fantasies of all time such as Willy Wonka and The Wizard of Oz.  Also like those films, Polar Express has a creepy scary quality that children who see this film will remember the rest of their lives.  Have any of us ever forgotten our childhood fear of the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz?

  Most of all what this film offers is movie magic.  At it's heart is a  one hour and forty minute train ride to a magical world of ghostly hobos, armies of elves, flying tickets, and creepy dead toys.

There were only a few minor points (what child would go with strangers - but then again, the movie was set in a different time, when kids played in the street into the dark hours and neighbors could be trusted).

In my opinion, Tom Hanks knew he had the resources to leave this world a Christmas legacy including a few new carols that will undoubtedly become part of our holiday folklore.  I think this project inspired him to leave us this beautiful and wondrous gift.",1100390400,3,683,4.528455284552845

Robert Zemckis took a real risk and it payed off because this film is excellent. The only problem I had with this movie was that Tom Hanks did too many voices. They could've branched out and could've had some other actors to do the other voices. \

The film is about a boy whose name is not said, is in bed on christmas eve and he rubs off off of us as a non-beliver of Santa. He, all the sudden, feels a rumbling and see lights, and he gets his robe on and goes out to look, it is The Polar Express, with Tom Hanks as The Conductor waiting to take him and a large amount of kids to the North Pole. He goes on the journey to the north pole and along the way He meets a ghost hobo, a boy afraid of christmas, a boy that is a smarty pants, and a girl that becomes his friend for the film and helps him make it through the movie. The movie is literally a roller coster ride, there are so many twist and turns on the way that you feel that you are riding along with them. This movie stays so true to the book, you won't belive it. Most movies base itself on the books! The ending made me tearful to know that Hero Boy now belived in Santa. That got me.

Robert has a great movie on his hands. Yet another great collaberation with Tom Hanks, that is full of Christmas cheer, imagination, and fun. Go see this movie a lot, and see it near Christmas time if it is still in movie theathers. I loved it, my mom loved it, and the rest of the family loved it.

2343282,5,B0009XRZ9M,"Adapted from a classic children's book written by Chris Van Allsburg to the screen using computerized technology about a train ride to the North Pole, an expensive process but well worth the visual effects.  This was a complete Tom Hanks film using software to match his voice and mannerisms to many varied roles.  I liked him best as the conductor who punched letters into the children's tickets, return punches would complete a word -- each different to match their personalities and needs.

There is a lovely snow scene in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve when the mysterious steam engine arrived in the boy's own front yard with effects (shaking and noise) similar to an earthquake.  A skeptic about the validity of Santa Claus, he'd already looked in the World Book encyclopedia to read about the North Pole never thinking he'd travel there in less than an hour.  The boy was a lot like Brett (age 9) as he watched the mechanical Santa in a store window as the train went past.

It is a magic train, all alight in several cars but the children, dressed in sleepware, sat in one car except for Billy.  A sad little boy who'd never received Christmas gifts, he sat by himself in the caboose.

There were tapdancing waiters who served refreshments.  The hot chocolate left a brown mustache (like the while 'milk' one) on each child.  A lost ticket, swirling in the wind, lands amid a wolf pack; with the help of a bald eagle, it magically found its way back inside the train.

That's only the beginning.  Boy discovers the hobo who calls himself the 'king of the train' on top of a coach car and they ski (cross-country style) to the engine where he jumps into the coal car.  He thought he was asleep and dreaming in the swirling snow.

The hobo imprints on his mind that 'seeing is believing.'  But after a harrowing escape from the breaking ice after the train jackknives and slithers to safety, he learns that 'sometimes the most real things in the world are those we cannot see.'

Inside the cab of the locomotive, he blows the whistle, and the train has to stop as deer are all over the tracks.  It seems that the engineer could talk Karibo when his long red hair is pulled.  Both engineers were comical characters as played by Michael Jeter.

The music was magnificent as they take a wild ride down the mountain like a roller coaster.  We witness optical illusions with the Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle.  The tramp turns out to be a puppeteer with a marionette of Scrooge (bah, humbug), both patterned after Tom Hanks.

At the North Pole, we see a lighted Christmas tree even taller than our National tree in Washington, D.C. or that at Rockefeller Center in New York City.  Three children are separated from the group and endure another wild ride on the curvy tracks around this city of lights in the runaway caboose.

There appears to Boy a ghost of the hobo offering a nice hot 'cup of Joe' before they are stranded on a train turntable.  After a perilous walk to the tunnel, they find Santa's workshop in a cul-de-sac (dead end).

The lost children had adventures galore in the inner workings of the labyrinth and see all the 'good of Christmas.'  If you see only one Christmas movie this year, let this be it.  A delight for the whole family, it can't be beat for having Christmas spirit -- plus appropriate music.

Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' is playing as the mountain of gifts is lifted from an open observatory like Kitt Peak in Arizona and floated over the lighted city in a hot air balloon.  The 'flying eleves' (""kids, do not try this at home,"" directed the conductor) sky-dived as the enormous bundle is loaded onto Santa's sleigh.  It takes some bungie-jumping to put the star on the tall tree.

As long trumpets herald the arrival of St. Nick, the prancing reindeer are a sight to behold.  It's as if we were in the Land of Oz with all the munchkins.  Santa's blue eyes were like those I remarked on recently when I talked with a 'Victorian Santa' at the East Tennessee History Center.

Santa explains his gifts: first, you must 'believe'; one child received a 'smidgin of humility'; another, ""no greater gift than friendship.""  He tells everyone that ""the true spirit of Christmas is in your heart.""  His fiber-optic reindeer whip made the tall tree magical.

The Polar Express returns and they leave the city of lights as they head for home amid thick snow flakes and sparkling icycles.  The children are told that ""it doesn't matter where a train is going; what matters is to decide to get on.""  Under the tree on Christmas morning is an old fashioned truck toy (which dates the story) and a harlequin doll like the one I have for Eric, age 4.  Santa had gift-wrapped and delivered his special present, The Christmas Bell.

Our local excursion train, the Rambler, is taking a Polar Express this Christmas on its regular route with readings of this book as special entertainment.  A giant step (I've been on these trips at different times of the Spring, Summer and Fall.), but this time it's 'reservation only.'

Completed in only 56 days as a result of the computer technology (rapid progress), I predict this will become a classic like Burl Ives' 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'  An uplifting story.",1100217600,14,5295,4.646236559139785
2343283,4,B0009XRZ9M,"First off, Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business.  He has always been way ahead in movie technology.  Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is.  And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.

This children's Christmas story is about boy named Billy, who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  So on Christmas Eve, a train named The Polar Express comes to pick him up and takes him on a journey to the North Pole. There he meets Santa Claus and believes in the Christmas spirit once again.  Thats basically the gist of the story.

As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie.  Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games.  Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing.  Also, Tom Hanks (oh yeah, he's in the movie) plays five different characters.  Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements.  The story itself is ok.  The major problem is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.

My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special.  The only thing special are the effects.  But this is still a good holiday movie for the family and I would reccommend that you take your family or loved one to see this movie.  Maybe the Christmas spirit in you will be rejuvenated, but probably not.",1100131200,7,1746,4.562700964630225

We have read the book many times, and I was pleased to see that the animation very closely resembled the illustrations by Chris Van Allsburg.  The visuals were stunning, and the familiar scenes from the book (the wolves in the forest, for example) were replicated as part of the animation.  The plot was also true to the book, embellished of course, but never in a way that detracted from Chris Van Allsburg's creation.  The ""Hot Chocolate"" scene left us sitting in amazement, probably with our mouths ajar.  Later, I actually found myself perched on the edge  of the seat more than once (and I am 52 years old) in eager anticipation of the next event.  Also, certain parts of the movie were quite touching.

2343286,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I went to see this movie tonight with a mentally handicapped friend - ""Michael"" -- (from a L'Arche home here in Winnipeg, Canada).  We were the first persons in the theatre for the very first evening showing in this city - and we were the last to leave.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - enchanted by the movie's subtleties and happily exhausted by its roller-coaster rides.

Time and again, Michael (who is sensitive, compassionate and with a good sense of humor) turned to me in the darkness, smiling in appreciation at the exact same moments I turned to see his reactions. Each time this happened, it was at a moment in the film when some little detail, perfectly captured through superb 'cinematography,' brought moisture to my normally cynical eye, and a warm smile to Michael's innocent face.

Some examples:  There is a lone, black child on this apparent 'dream train' to the North Pole - a girl of about ten or eleven years, and like a painting come to life, the miraculous technology at work in this film  captures the particular sensibilities of this  compassionate, black youngster ---  We see small mannerisms of someone comfortable with herself in a way the other (ten or so) white kids on the train are not.  And the effect is profound --- the movie audience, including some children of that same age group, went silent at such moments in the film.

My friend Michael - who has a 'savant' genius for perceiving my emotions, and expressing them for me out loud in public --- Michael turned to me with a delighted smile when the girl on the train reaches out to hold the hands of the poorest boy, sitting alone in the rear compartment; and later, she hugs two other boys, (one of them the central character) --- at their final parting. At that moment I held up a finger to my lips to try to hush Michael, but couldn't prevent him from saying aloud:  ""She's such a sweetheart.""  There were murmurs of appreciation in the darkness around us, responding to this innocent sentiment.

There is a sublime moment, on the back platform of the moving train -- the Northern Lights glimmering in the distance -- when the young girl joins in song with the poorest kid on the train (a younger boy from a dilapidated home on the ""far side of the tracks""). I admit to being overcome with emotion during this duet (a lovely, strong melody with poignant lyrics) - and I blurted out loud to Michael, after the first chorus: ""What a wonderful song!""  The refrain includes the words ""When Christmas comes to town.""  [It's a song so good that, with some future 'cover versions' by serious musicians who could do it justice ---  this ""Christmas Comes to Town"" song could, I believe, deservedly join the small list of true, Christmas 'classics.']

I'd have to agree with anyone who thinks this movie is a little short on plot.  And yet . . .  once you've suspended disbelief --  beginning with an earth-shattering, Christmas-eve arrival of a steam-puffing, passenger train on a small-town Michigan street, directly outside the home of the movie's central character -- once we've swallowed that premise, the movie disarmingly embraces the child in us, (including our fears) and our reservations vanish without our noticing.

Just as great `realistic' painters, (think Rembrandt or Vermeer) worked wonders of light & shadow that no mere photograph could ever capture, so too this computer-animated marvel takes your breath away through an accumulation of tiny but acute observations that could never be captured by conventional cinematography. Prime examples from the opening scenes:

A shaft of light illuminates the boy's bedroom, and he is reflected in a chrome, automobile hubcap leaning against a wall; at once we share his view -- through the keyhole of his bedroom door - we can see only the backs and the dressing gowns of mother and father, as they say goodnight to the boy's young sister, after determining the state of her belief in Santa's existence - a belief no longer shared by the older brother, whose eye is at the keyhole.

Later, on the train, there's an exquisite close up of the boy's face, a slight blemish above the pores on his upper right cheek; the `camera' pans in rotation, capturing perfectly, the texture of the boy's hair, and that of the young black girl sitting beside him  -- subtleties of such perfection one wonders if the unique, artistic accomplishment of ""Polar Express"" could ever be surpassed.

The film's last scene, consists entirely of a close-up view of a small, silver bell (of the type associated with sleigh rides) with its attached 'ribbon' of red leather.  The little bell helps make the final point about `Belief' --- in things unseen, (or forgotten, and thus inaccessible to some adults). So simple, so powerful, so enlightening an image. My friend Michael turned to me at that moment, with a radiant smile. And we just shook our heads in awe.

----

Yes, this movie must have SOME shortcomings - one or two moments that don't quite work as intended by the creators.  But right now, in the afterglow, I can't recall what they were. The film  was just too satisfying an experience!

I'm a 57-year-old grandfather who happens to believe that ""The Polar Express"" is the first, true Christmas classic in almost 60 years.  Not since the original Kris Kringle ""Miracle"" movie of 1947, has any film (to my jaded eye) so transcended our secular, commercial views of the Holiday Season, with such uplifting and fresh reminders of the timeless and true spirit of Christmas.

2343288,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I teach kindergarten and Polar Express has long been one of my favorite Christmas books.  When I first saw the trailer for the movie almost a year ago, it took my breath away. I have been so excited about the movie's release that I have been counting the days.  To Mr. Wharton I will say, if we make judgements based on such limited information (as say a movie trailer), I wouldn't put much stock in the opinion of someone who can't even spell correctly.  If high quality and perfection are the qualities you seek, start first with yourself.  Personally, I thought the trailer did exactly what was intended - it presented just enough to whet the appetite without giving away the entire movie.  I hope you will go see the movie with an open mind rather than a preconceived idea influenced by your limited expectations.  Keep in mind however that this is a story for children based on great children's literature. As a teacher, I am thrilled to finally see such quality in film for young children after so much junk (I am not referring to Pixar).",1099958400,21,1044,4.55614973262032
2343289,5,B0009XRZ9M,This is one of the best ground-breaking CGI animation film. It was so breath-taking. It had a very creative stroy to it. It was not a very predictible movie at all. Amazing how they made it. They really captured a unique style to the film. So it has a completely different style to it then Pixar films. When you take the director of Forest Gump and Castaway add Tom Hanks CGI animation a classic christmas picture book and you have a amazing film. A Must see this holiday season.,1099699200,14,479,4.393258426966292

Don't bother with the flat version, see it in 3-D. This is polarized 3-D using clear glasses, not the inferior red/blue anaglyph stuff used for SPY KIDS. Take your kids to a REAL 3-D movie!",1099008000,12,424,4.367088607594937
2343291,3,B0009XRZ9M,"I am a child therapist and recently viewed the trailer for ""Polar Express"" with my daughter (age 10).  We also saw cuts from the movie on Oprah.  My child said that the animated characters were ""almost real looking - but kinda creepy"" and due to that she doesn't want to see the movie.

A few other children have made similar comments.  Apparently there is a line that animators can cross when their characters are almost too real. This is interesting in that the children I know enjoyed Toy Story.",1098748800,10,498,4.561797752808989
2343292,5,B0009XRZ9M,"I have read the book to my kid and loved it.  When I saw the trailer for this movie I flipped.  The movie The Polar Express is about a kid that jumps on a midnight train in the middle of the night and is driven to the North Pole with a bunch of kids.  When he gets there, the North Pole is like a place that can't be like the north pole in the movie The Santa Clause with Tim Alan.  It has to be animated in order for the Director to expand on what he can make.  However, the animation looks real anyway so who cares.  Plus, we have got Tom Hanks, the king of voices, playing alot of the parts.  It will be a magical rollercoaster, especially when the boy gets picked by Santa Clause to receive the first gift of Christmas.  I suggest not only to see the movie but get the book.(It is a picture book for a kid but it is great!)",1092268800,12,827,3.910179640718563
