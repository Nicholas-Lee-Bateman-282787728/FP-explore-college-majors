2545949,5,B000EXZKR6,My kids love this Godzilla/Godzuki cartoon. A great alternative to those more violent Godzilla movies out there for the younger set.,1168300800,,132,5.333333333333333
2545950,5,B000EXZKR6,"this was my favorite when I was a kid, and still is...

as old as it is, it still captivates my own children ages 9 and 3, who are used to the fast-paced, confusing modern storylines of Pokemon and others...

the best thing is, is that there are recently produced Godzilla movies by Toho with better special effects (for adults and kids), and recently produced Godzilla toys available in toy stores all across the country, so that your child can also join in the adventures, or make their own!

my only qibble, is I wish they would release the rest of the cartoons seasons / episodes",1165363200,,583,4.481132075471698
2545951,1,B000EXZKR6,"I loved Godzilla when I was a small child, and when I heard that he was to be in a cartoon show, I expected a lot. My disappointment with this show started with the opening credits when Godzilla opened his mouth and emitted the wrong roar. Knowing now that Toho was responsible for this omission and not HB doesn't make it any more forgivable, especially when the animated series based on GINO (TriStar's ""Godzilla In Name Only"") does have better stories and the right roar (although not the right character!)

The horrors with HB's Godzilla continued as it became a ""monster of the week"" show. Suddenly, Earth was overrun with monsters for Godzilla to deal with each week. And of course the character was further bastardized by adding a cute junior version of the Big G and a group of lame supporting human characters that just compounded the mess.

This Godzilla, simply put, has nothing to do with the Godzilla that I love from the movie series. GINO was more loyal to the essence of the character, if not the appearance and backstory. I recall the word I used most when describing this tripe as a youth was ""stupid."" Growing up hasn't made this show any better.",1156896000,9,1165,4.6231884057971016
2545952,3,B000EXZKR6,"That's right, I am asking for a better DVD release for this classic cartoon. I haven't bought the cartoon on DVD, as yet. I want to. I really liked this cartoon growing up. I am glad that it is on DVD - at the very least, anyway. What I am bugged about is why each DVD release only has four episodes on it. What not release all the episodes in one release? That's what I am bummed about. I really don't have the cash, or don't want to shell out the money they are asking, for a tease of a release. If this is the only ever release of this cartoon, I will wait for the price to come down and then buy. Still, we are out about eighteen episodes. If it comes out altogether, I'd rather buy that. To sum up: good cartoon, bad marketing practice.",1153699200,2,741,4.0476190476190474
2545953,5,B000EXZKR6,"This is a very entertaining show. I have to agree that it is true to the classic Showa series. It takes place just after the end of that series.

 It is 1 of only three american project set in the Showa universe. The others are the Marvel comic and the Wonderland audio adventures. (All other american made Godzilla projects such as the Novels, Dark Horse comics and Tri-star cartoon don't follow the continuity of any of the movie series.)

The Hanna-Barbera Godzilla show follows the same basic format as the movies.

But the momentum is always forward (especially on DVD with no reruns to contend with) as Godzilla battles a new beast in every episode. No repeats like in the movies.

Ther constant re-use of the same classic monster again and again has bogged down the movies in recent years (I've gotten VERY tired of seeing Mothra, Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla constantly being reinvented.)

Ye, this show never used any of Toho's other monsters, but I think its okay: and the monsters HB came up with have a Japanese flavor. There is a giant turtle in one episode, alot like Gamera. Some episodes have walking statues or idols like Majin.

There is a giant robot like in Johnny Sokko or Ultraseven, and there are dinosaur types and aliens like in Ultraman. In fact the plot of this show is alot like Ultraman and other monster of the week shows. Think about it. {  A group of scientists travels around investigating strange phenomena and discover a monster which must be dealt with, and is destroyed by episodes end.

Since the ULTRAMAN vol. 1 box is really bad quallity. Buy this show or the KING KONG cartoon instead.",1153353600,,1624,4.670175438596491
2545954,5,B000EXZKR6,"Really worth owning. A great show that is true to the spirit of classic G.

Far better than the Tri star garbage. This is the real king in animated form.",1153180800,,153,4.1
2545955,5,B000EXZKR6,"This series is really one of Hanna-Barbera's best shows as the animation, writing and voice work is far superior to the other ""cookie-cutter"" produced shows the studio was churning out at the time. (Yogi's Space Race anyone?) It was originally presented under the title ""THE GODZILLA POWER HOUR"" (Not ""The Godzilla Show"") and was paired with a good adventure show called ""Jana of the Jungle"" (sadly not presented here) about  a Sheena type jungle-woman looking for her lost father. Ratings for this second half of the ""power hour"" were awful as kids tuned out after the Godzilla segment ended. So Jana was dropped after only three months and replaced with two older, already tested HB shows and the title was changed to ""GODZILLA SUPER 90"".

 Like many a movie series, once the box office has dried up, the next step is television. (That's right kiddies!! In ye olden days they used to turn successful movies into crappy TV shows. Not the other way around like it is now.)  Shaft, Planet of the Apes, Topper, The Thin Man.... The list goes on. Godzilla was no exception. The movie series had ended in Japan in 1975 but in America he was having a revival. Godzilla vs. Megalon had been widely ditributed to theatres in summer of 1976 by Cinema Shares, a low rent distribution company best known for handly Kung Fu movies, and been a smashing success. It was the first Godzilla film in the US since Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster in 1971. It was shown on NBC in a prime time slot the following year, hosted by John Belushi in a Godzilla suit and was a ratings grabber. 77-78 saw the release of  Godzilla on Monster Island, Godzilla vs the Cosmic Monster and Terror of Godzilla to weekend matinee's.  A Godzilla comic book from Marvel had started in 1977. Mattel, and some other companies also, released Godzilla toys such as the giant sized SHOGUN WARRIORS Godzilla and Rodan toys, ""Godzilla's Gang"" set of vinyl monster dolls, a UFO smashing ""Godzilla Game"" and a hugely popular bendie doll sold at Toys R Us  stores. Wonderland Records released an equally popular Godzilla record featuring two exciting, and new, audio adventures. Viewmaster reels ware available featuring a Marvel comics adventure in 3-D. Adding to Godzilla's career boon was the fact that  eleven Godzilla movies were in pretty heavy rotation on television. (Corporate free, infomercial free UHF, those were the days.)

With all this popularity, and no more Godzilla movies available for release in America, the time was obviously right for a Godzilla cartoon.

At this time, the US rites to the Godzilla character were owned by Henry Saperstein of United Productions of America company. The creators of Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoingboing.  Saperstein had released Godzilla vs. the Thing and Godzilla's Revenge in North America through American International Pictures, held the television rites to Godzilla's latest and final film , Terror of Mechagodzilla, and had even bankrolled Monster Zero with Toho In Japan.  Saperstein licensed the character to

Hanna-Barbera and the animated series was born.

Many Godzilla purists dislike the HB GODZILLA series, but I think it is pretty true to the character as he was being depicted by Toho at the time (Think Godzilla vs. Megalon), and was therefor a pretty logical progression. Some object to Godzillas physical appearance. It is obviously based on the famousAurora model kit, itself based on stills from King Kong vs. Godzilla. I happen to think that, given the limits of television produced animation at the time, its a farly faithful design.

Yes he doesn't have the movie Godzilla's voice. But I can understand

why the animators probably didn't use it. I'm guessing they just didn't think about it. They weren't intentionally trying to disregard the original

like the @$$-h0les at Centropolis. They just made an honest mistake while otherwise trying to do the right thing.

Others dislike his breathing fire instead of his usual blue beam-like weapon. I think that this is splitting hares, since the breath weapon is described as ""fire"" in several

of the early Japanese Godzilla films. I feel that the beam-like appearance was just a contrivance of the special effects available to Toho. Heck, in some scenes Godzilla would expell smoke, steam and fire extinguisher spray.

And still others don't like the laser beam eye rays Godzilla has.

I say,"" The more powers, the better""!!!!!! Whose to say that Godzilla cantshoot lasers out of his eyes. I can beleive it. He can breath fire and atomic particles. He can fly and turn himself into a magnet. He can breath at the bottom of the ocean and on an alien planet. Godzilla is my hero and he can do anything. Even shoot lasers from his eyes.

As for the show itself. I think the plots are ""Right On"", Man.

Some of the storys, most in fact, are simular to the Toho films. One episode in particular was very much like Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster.

There are many ""island adventure"" episodes like 'Sea Monster or Son of Godzilla. Some feature ""ancient evils"", such as giant monsters, returning after thousands of years of exile. Very much like some of Tohos monsters such as Megalon. There are alien invasion storys  Just as in Destroy All Monsters or Monster Zero. There is a giant robot episode even, and many of the monster designes look like they could have jumped right out of a Japanese film. The Forgotten Islands ""Cyclops"", Megavolt, Watchuka and Moonlode come to mind. Heck, there is even a giant turtle!!!

The show is basically a pretty fair continuation of where the films left

off. No its not Toho, But its not Tri-Star either. So, be thankfull Godzilla fans.

On thing to look for on the DVD. The standard opening credits sequence

has been replaced on all the episodes by an alternate one that originally aired only at the beginning of the episode ""The TIme Dragons""(believed to be the first episode produced) It is basically the same as the standard opening but at the end features a title card crediting Henry Saperstein and Toho pictures. This is entirely understandable really. No big deal",1149811200,14,6077,4.8785228377065115
2545956,5,B000EXZKR6,"This DVD is called ""Godzilla: The Original Animated Series Volume 1.""

I was born in 1971. So when Hanna Barbera's ""Godzilla"" cartoon came out in the late 1970s, I was the perfect age for its intended audience.

This show featured the Calico, a research ship that traveled all over the world. The Calico carried all sorts of scientific research equipment with it, as well as a minicopter, a minisub, a bathosphere, a hovercraft, and a lifeboat. The Calico's crew consisted of Captain Carl Majors, Dr. Quinn Darian (a research scientist), Brock (Dr. Darian's assistant), Pete (Dr. Darian's nephew), and Godzooky. Godzooky was apparently a younger relative of Godzilla. He was also Pete's pet.

Although no episode of the show ever mentioned how the crew of the Calico became friends with Godzooky and Godzilla, it was mentioned in a press release when the show first aired: Godzooky was trapped in a coral reef, and he was rescued by the Calico's crew.

As the crew of the Calico traveled all over the world, they would encounter various monsters, creatures, bad guys, villains, enemies, etc. When they got in trouble, they could summon Godzilla by pressing a button on a small handheld signaler, which would emit a sonic frequency. Godzilla would then appear and save the day. When the signaler was unavailable, or broken, or when the sonic frequency was blocked, they could also call Godzilla by having Godzooky scream. Since Godzilla was a good guy, he would always do whatever he could to help them.

This show had lots of action, adventure, and heroism. In the 26 episodes of this series, there were monsters, dragons, dinosaurs, giant insects, volcanoes, time travel, aliens, spaceships, meteors, asteroids, missiles, tanks, and numerous references to classic science fiction and ancient mythology. The show had everything that a boy my age could ever ask for in a TV show. It was my favorite show at the time.

I still love the show today. It's not my #1 favorite any more, but it is still in my top 10.

Classic Media has issued a statement regarding the contents of this DVD. The episodes will be in chronological order, starting with the first episode of the series.

This DVD contains 4 episodes. They are:

The Fire Bird - A giant flying creature that lives inside a volcano is wreaking havoc for the people who live nearby. Godzilla has to stop the creature before it lays eggs. This is a good introduction to the series.

The Eartheater - San Francisco is being terrorized by a giant creature that lives underground and eats dirt. Buildings are collapsing all over the place. The entire city and its inhabitants are threatened. This is a very good early episode. Of the 4 episodes on this DVD, this one is my favorite.

Attack Of The Stone Creatures - A pair of giant ancient stone creatures have come to life in Egypt. Their breath creates blizzards in the middle of the desert. This is a pretty good episode.

The Megavolt Monster - While doing scientific research in the bathosphere, Dr. Darian and Brock become trapped by several giant creatures that live in a giant air bubble at the bottom of the ocean. Godzilla carries Captain Majors and Pete down there to help rescue them inside his hand, which Captain Majors says is ""air tight and pressure proof."" This is another good episode.",1144800000,40,3302,4.8144876325088335

2545960,3,B000EXZKR6,"This old Hanna Barbera animated series starring a tamed Godzilla (who would come to the aid of the Calico crew, a small group of explorers and environmentalists, at the push of a button no matter if they were in the middle of the ocean or in the middle of the deserteven my young mind always wondered at how they managed that; he was like their giant guard dog) and what was commonly thought to be his son, the daffy bat-winged Godzooky who you either loved because of his adorable gumption and pluck or hated because he was always getting into trouble (like Gilligan from Gilligans Island) and had an annoying cow-like mewl, is likely only going to be of interest to those old-timers who grew up on this fare.  The animation is slight with scene after scene being repeated, a trick that HB and other cartoon companies overused, and Godzilla and other monsters sizes constantly shifting.  If you can get past that then there is something to like about the series and those are the monsters.  They vary from creative (like the pair of stone Egyptian lions who can breathe out frosty air!) to yawn average (like the Fire Bird).  Godzilla never dallies with any of the other Toho icons that served as his rogues gallery (frown).  A great opening theme propels a fun for the kids series of the time but this hasn't aged well.

2545997,3,B000EXZKR6,"I have been on a nostalgia kick lately, watching old cartoons from my youth ranging from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-Dragons/dp/B002DH20Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons & Dragons</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Chan-and-the-Chan-Clan/dp/B008BSM18M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan</a>. I've actually been surprised at how well these old cartoons hold up, at how they can still entertain. Next up on my list was the old 1978 Hanna-Barbera cartoon ""Godzilla!""

Like a lot of kids of the era, I was hooked on the late-`70s Godzilla revival when the ""Godzilla vs. "" flicks were being shown on broadcast TV. I had the ""Shogun Warriors"" toys to battle Godzilla, and I loved the Hanna-Barbera ""Godzilla Power Hour."" I saw nothing at all incongruous about a team of American researchers being able to summon Godzilla like an overgrown watchdog using nothing more than a signal watch. It was all cool.

And it still is. Sure, the stories are simple and cookie-cutter, but the animation is actually quite decent for the times, and the plots are no worse than your standard Godzilla flick. The crew of the Calico research vessel finds ancient, sleeping guardians or scientific monsters, and pretty soon all-out Giant Monster Battle ensues.

""Godzilla"" follows Hanna-Barbera illogic, with Godzilla rising up from the ocean depths and essentially walking on water until it is time for him to sink back down. He increases in size multiple times over a few frames, from big enough to lift a sailing ship in a single hand, to small enough to carry a single human. And then there is Godzooky, the wacky side-kick. Godzooky is the American equivalent of Minira, and acts more like a friendly dog than a junior monster.

The only real disappointment in the series is the lack of Godzilla's famous roar, which apparently Hanna-Barbera couldn't or didn't get the rights to (the monster and roar are sold separately, it appears). They apparently also only licensed Godzilla himself: None of the classic Godzilla monsters appear, but there are more than enough new monsters to go around.

The DVDs for ""Godzilla"" are disappointing as well. Season One is split into three DVDs with four episodes a piece. This could easily have been a single box, 2-disk set. Season Two of the series remains unreleased. It would be nice to see a Complete Series release on 2 or 3 disks like they have been doing with some other older Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

2546000,5,B000EXZKR6,"I purchased all 3 volumes which, by the way, comprise the original televised ""season one."" As of the date of this review, season 2 has not been released. I bought them for my nine year old son with the ulterior motive that I was also buying them for the nine year old in me! You see, I was one of the kids in the late seventies that LOVED this show. The strains of its theme, ""Up from the depths..., etc."" played itself endlessly in my head back then, and, watching it again, has proven as stubborn as ever to dislodge. As classic Hanna Barbera entertainment, it's an example of their standard form, following the pattern of some of their best stuff. The stories are solid and the formula is consistent. And, ultimately, the proof is in the pudding - my son finds them downright exciting. Score one for Dad.",1298419200,2,807,4.422818791946309
2546001,5,B000EXZKR6,Well worth the money I say.  I am really enjoying being able to buy the DVDs of cartoons I grew up with.  Godzilla is a really cool series especially with it being centered around water with the Calico and it's crew.  Godzooky adds a nice humorous touch to the mix.  Highly recommended.,1279238400,2,286,4.4423076923076925

2546003,5,B000EXZKR6,I was surprised how good the quality of the picture was considering it's an old show. Glad it's finally on dvd. They don't make cartoons like the 80's one anymore!,1229644800,,163,4.466666666666667

2546006,5,B000EXZKR6,"I am disapointed that this disk has only 4 episodes, for the price it should have been like 10 eps. or so. but what makes it worth it is seeing both the big G and Godzuki drawn so sexily.",1171584000,,187,3.8205128205128207

8115635,3,B000EXZKR6,"I have fond memories of this show so I decided to get at least the first DVD of the series. Classic HB style though it is a little slow. As much as I love me some giant monsters, I'd much rather be watching other Classic HB cartoons. Showed my son who loves his Godzilla toys ( too young for the movies) this show and he was uninterested as well. Perhaps the better episodes are on one of the other two volumes.",1483142400,,411,4.08641975308642
