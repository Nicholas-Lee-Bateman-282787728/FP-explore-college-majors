664168,1,6303455190,"I wish I could find something positive to say about this film, but it would be sinful not to warn others about it.  I watched this film with some friends and felt compelled to apologize to them afterword.  It's difficult to find the right words to describe how unbelievably bad it is.  The acting is atrocious, the photography is horrible, the script is non existent and the ending brings a movie that is already painful to sit through to an excruiatingly, tortuous finish, like a slow painful death.  It would be hell to be forced to watch this one again.",1082160000,12,556,4.53
664169,2,6303455190,"Chances are good that most of us in our 40s and 50s have unpleasant memories of Sunday School.  Of all my own distasteful memories, the very worst are the hokey illustrations in the kids Bible we used to read.  Remember them?  The kind of drawings that still appear in Jehovah's Witness literature that depict Jesus and Joseph and Mary as clean-cut suburban types dressed in bathrobes?  That stylized 1950s look, in which Jesus and his disciples look like cleancut college boys, turned me off of religion for years.  Even now, I cringe when I come across examples of it.
That's why I cringed when I watched ""The Judas Project.""  A good concept--a twentieth-century Christ--but an unspeakably bad presentation.  The music is horrible pop evangelism, banged out on a piano, with insipid lyrics.  The dialogue is wooden, with contemporary cool talk mashed together with quotations from the King James that make little sense.  The acting is one-dimensional and stereotypical; even veteran character actor Jeff Corey, who plays the twentieth-century version of Caiaphas, is atrocious, looking as if he's been drugged and then dragged to the set.  The camera work is amateurish; in one scene, where Judas and Jesse (the Christ figure) are in an animated conversation at a cafe table (with a rather stupid Peter wordlessly looking on), the camera lights are so close and so hot that the faces of the two speakers become beaded with sweat.  The Mount Tabor transfiguration scene is pure kitsch masquerading as piety.  In short, the movie started out bad, and just got worse and worse.  As a piece of art, it's embarrassing.  As an apologetic, it's off-putting--just like being in Sunday School again!
This isn't to say the film is a total failure.  It does have moments when it almost rises to the occasion.  The central dilemma introduced in the film--the way of love and powerlessness represented by the Christ figure, and the way of worldly domination and power represented by the Judas figure--is important and timely.  But it's barely scratched, and even then seems like a leftover from the Judas-Jesus conflict in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (an infinitely better movie, by the way).  The crucifixion scene, which takes place in an abandoned barn, has great cinemagraphic potential.  But the camera person blows it again, failing to take advantage of the possibilities.
St. Paul says that when we grow up, it's time to put away the things of childhood.  Too true.  So let me encourage readers of this review to skip this Sunday School caricature and go straight to some adult cinematic explorations of Christ.  Denys Arcand's ""Jesus of Montreal"" or even Mel Gibson's recent and controversial ""The Passion of the Christ"" would be good places to start.",1079654400,11,2745,5.013245033112582
664170,1,6303455190,"This film is an utter failure in every way.  I sets the gospel of Jesus in a modern setting and attempts to draw you into this ""what if"" scenario.  Well, it was a noble effort, but EVERYTHING ELSE about the film was horrendous.  From poor acting, horrible script, no direction,(just to name a few) and poor technical effects (few of which appeared to have anything to do with budget) to a complete disregard to the cultural implications of Jesus not having appeared some 2000 years ago.  One of the filmakers even brags about having composed the music before the film was written!  He BRAGS about it!  You don't brag about that, because it's an extremely DUMB thing to do!  Please do not use this film as a basis for your Christianity!  If it converts you, then God has made it so DESPITE the efforts of these filmakers!  It was a good idea that went horribly wrong. Only buy this film as an example of pitiful filmaking!",1052524800,2,921,4.5
664171,4,6303455190,"This film is truly an adventure in a difficult anachronism: how to present the gospel in the modern context while retaining the significant symbols, individuals, events, and texts. Overall, it does it very well, though there remains the difficult question of what must be given up to make it modern. The largest problem is the complete separation from an Old Testament (i.e. Jewish) background. This is a gospel that is not preceeded by a prophecy - Jesus just appears - no voice crying out in the wilderness, no sacrificial system to fulfill, no Law.
But despite these difficulties, the film manages to present one of the most thoughtful and divinely-human portrayals of Jesus on film. I prefer it to most that strive for pure historical accuracy. Additionally, the relationship between Jesus (Jesse), Judas, and Peter is explored in a new way that makes you truly understand the tragedy of Judas' decision.
I advise this film to people often, though not to everyone. It was made on a relatively small budget and that shows sometimes. But I tear up everytime I go through the crucifixion scene. I wish there was more emphasis in rejoicing in the resurrection, though... A powerful, albeit flawed, film.",1029801600,6,1203,4.96039603960396
664172,1,6303455190,"The movie is based on one question: ""What if the saga of Jesus happened today?"". The problem is, the question is never answered. What this film is, is simply a modern day re-telling of the saga of Jesus. It is too literal an interpretation. The 12 desciples are still all men. They are all named the same as the original 12. ""Jesse"" (why not Joshua???), as the savior is called, feeds the hungry with bread instead of something modern like pizza. Jesse is executed on the cross instead of by lethal injection or some other modern method.
Although most of the story was a bit judgmental and anti-semitic in some aspects, the special effects were good and the crusifixion scene was intense and very dramatic.
I'd stay away from this one.",1016496000,,735,4.6183206106870225

664223,3,6303455190,"This is an interesting movie to try and review.  I think your perception of it will differ greatly depending on how you went into this film.  If you are looking for a serious and dramatic re-telling of the story of Christ, you are in the wrong place.  If you have a couple of friend over and are willing to mock the movie relentlessly (MST3K style) then this is a must-own!
I can't believe that this film is already 20 years old.  I remember watching it back in the late 90s.  I was at a Christian summer camp that had this and me and a couple of friends thought it would be fun to check out.  It was!  I don't remember much, but I do remember the guy playing the Ciaphas had the biggest eyebrows I have ever seen.  I'm giving it a 3 because it is, by all counts, a terrible move.  The acting is stilted, the cinematography is terrible, and they crucify jesus to wall!  However, just for the great memories and fun times I had with my friends I still look back fondly on the weird piece of cinema.

664224,5,6303455190,I saw this movie during it's theatrical run TWICE. Not ashamed to say I cried both times. This movie should have had greater coverage and should get regular Christmas / Easter television play as it brings the crucifiction to modern times and would appeal to today's younger generations. I would have to speculate that won't happen because there are no hidden Pepsi ads or nudity or commercial money making in it.,1384300800,,412,4.816901408450704
664225,5,6303455190,"I really enjoyed this movie and it's timely message. Eternal salvation of our souls only through faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus, that God sent Him, and nothing else to die for our sins.

I saw it in College upon it's release and it was as good as I remember. Unfortunately, there are many out there, with extremely intolerant and bigoted views, that are full of fear and hat that oppose this message.  These small minded people make simplistic and distorted statements and yet they still cannot support their very hate filled views.  based on their narrow minded perspectives, I suspect these people have very limited educations.  I doubt they have actually seen this fine movie, but are just parroting what they have heard others say about it.

If you are looking to spend some time on fine entertainment with a wholesome message I suggest check out the Judas Project.",1380412800,3,883,4.782894736842105

664227,5,6303455190,"I love this movie.  I bought the movie in both VHS and DVD formats.  I've watched it over 20 times except the parts of the crucifixion.
It is the only movie I've ever watched more than twice.  I personally believe it brings the message that God is trying to convey to mankind that He is love and loves us.  You can see that love in this movie.  I love the words that Jesse speaks to the prositutes (kindness), Judas (understanding), the religious man (exposure to the religious spirit's destructive ways) and the power he exhibits through his love.  All I can say is WOW and that I wish everyone could see it.  There is much more behind this movie than what you know.",1317513600,,667,4.373983739837398
664228,5,6303455190,"What would have happened if Christ had come in this day and age as opposed to the backwards town and strange land that Judas sang about? His name would be jesse, and the events sdtill would have taken place regardless. That's what the Judas Project taught me. But unlike the Jesus movies of old, though classics in their own right, this movie takes you into the heart and soul of jesse and those who folow him. It even shows you the darkness that follows those who would seek to control him or to kill him. I saw this movie many years ago, when it was released in theaters, and was blown away by the complex simplicity of it. In my collection now, I would tell anyone that believes to own a copy and to those who don't, I still have a tendency not to, but this movie still had the capacity to make me think.",1316304000,,807,4.212903225806452
664229,5,6303455190,"I have meet James Barden and after hearing his story and what he went thru I have a great deal of respect for this man. He did something that none of the other reviewers have done and that is to create a Movie. God put it on his heart and James Barden created the Movie. I so happened to love the movie, some of you may not and that is fine. This is not another feel good christian movie made for christians but a Movie for non-christians for them to at least open their hearts up some to the Gospel.
I never watch Movies with so called ""Christians"" because they are too judgemental. They come with all their religious theories and judgemental attitudes and totally can ruin something that the Lord wants to do.
I have no question that Mr. Barden's Movie has served its puppose and will continue to do so in leading and helping others to Christ.
For those of you that find joy in judging Mr. Barden work I find you no better than the Pharisees that Jesus had to deal with.
The way I look at it is Mr Barden is doing it alot better than the way you are not!
Thanks Mr Barden and I hope you created more work like this in the future.",1294790400,,1131,4.1454545454545455
664230,3,6303455190,"This movie is not terrible as some people have suggested. First off, I'm sure some people found it to be very, very odd seeing Jesse the modern day Jesus on a beach preaching to odd looking people holding umbrellas. To me I simply thought the decision to go that way in the film was simply quirky and fresh. I liked the character of Jesse in this film. I thought he was Christ Like. Sure, there is so, so much that could not be included in this film to connect the film back 2000 years, but still most of us pretty much knew what was happening.

I thought the crucifixion in the film was pretty good. I thought the building where the act took place was quite rustic and beautiful. Even more beauty was found as the body of Jesse was driven through town on a wagon behind two horses. The grave yard scenes were also quite beautiful and picturesque. I thought that portion of the film was quite classy.

As for the names of the apostles, I didn't quite catch those, but I thought it was nice to use a handicapped person to play (Peter), or whatever the film called him. I also thought Jesse made for a good modern day Jesus.

The worst part of this movie is EASILY some of the very, very, very sappy and stupid songs. Now some of the songs are ok, but some of the songs and accompanying scenes are simply over the top BAD.

This film is worth watching. It isn't exacly good and it isn't exactly awful. The movie does indeed have a fairly solid plot with some weaknesses that make us at times wonder just what is going on and who some of the characters might be.

I gave the film three stars trying to take the middle ground. I was not offended by a modern story of Christ. I wasn't going to sink the movie in the ratings because of the nauseting music, but I'm sure some of you had to. The music really is quite awful in places and I myself had to fast forward a couple of times. And there are a LOT of songs in this movie.

In closing, I was impressed with the grave yard resurrections, the shaking and exploding tombs and graves, the ascending spirits, the clouds, the hokey lightening storm. At this point I felt like I was watching a B grade horror movie. It was entertaining and rather fun.",1267315200,,2193,4.259615384615385
664251,1,6303455190,"I was unlucky enough to see this in the theater in Austin, Texas in the early 1990s.

I walked out halfway through it because it is so incredibly bad.

Do NOT waste one second of your time.

If you want to know about Jesus, go to the ""Bibles"" section of amazon and buy a King James Bible and read that.",1203897600,4,302,4.0
664252,2,6303455190,"In ""The Judas Project"", Jesus never came 2000 years ago. Instead now, in the present, god sends his son, Jesse, to do what Jesus didn't do. And although society is very different from 2000 years ago, he gets pretty much the same reception. Loyal followers as well as detractors.

I'm sure that if this movie had been done right, it could have been useful for discussions in church youth groups. But the film has too many flaws to succeed. First of all, it's badly written. The story is very unfocused. There are long sequences where not much happens and then all of a sudden everything happens at once, and again, a long montage with schmaltzy music, where nothing happens. And most of the ""dramatic"" scenes are just cheesy, although the movie does have some pretty good special effects for a low budget movie of its time, and I really liked the graveyard scene towards the end.

Another problem is in the casting. SOme actors do good jobs, some less so, and the Jesus/Jesse character is very uncharismatic; it's hard to believe he would gain such a following.

In conclusion, ""The Judas Project"" is a pretty bad movie. It does have some entertainment value and is interesting as an example of unsuccessful religious filmmaking, but this doesn't make it worth buying at full price, especially since the DVD transfer is quite bad, with bad sound and picture quality. I found it for $3.99, which I found to be a reasonable price.",1191024000,,1427,4.7
664253,1,6303455190,"Well, there's got to be some good use for this DVD. You certainly don't want to watch it. I can't beleive I paid good money for this thing.

No sensible plot, dialogue, acting... It's bad through and through.

Ahhh! Yes, it's just occurred to me... I will use this to press out hamburgers. At least they are not quite so lacking in nutritive value.

For the love of God, stay away from this travesty.",1190419200,,400,4.378378378378378
664254,1,6303455190,"Okay...speaking as a Christian and one of the biggest supporters of fresh and innovative ways to relay the message to modern contemporary society, I cringed from the opening to the conclusion of this film. Not that the idea wasn't an awesome one(Jesus' 1st coming being today instead of 2,000 years ago), it was just so lacking and predictable in the acting and plotting departments. If you're interested in a more potent visualization of what things may've been like if Jesus' had never come until our time...I strongly recommend JOSHUA(Jesus ""returns"" to reconcile Catholics w/t Protestants in a small town and ultimately reinterates His true, salvific purpose in a meeting with the Pope) and HERO: THE ROCK OPERA (a musical, set in a near yet alternate future in which Jesus story is retold in contemporary context only in N.Y., the Roman Empire evolved into I.C.O.N., no churches save the Temple, etc).",1187740800,3,906,5.046666666666667
664255,2,6303455190,"I had high hopes for this movie, as I have often wondered that if I lived in a contemporary time with Jesus, would I have believed Him?  However, this movie was pretty terrible.  It quoted a lot of Scripture, which was pretty accurate, but it lacked direction and just seemed weird.  The cover of the DVD was misleading also, showing ""Jesus"" in blue jeans with helicopters hovering about in front of a city skyline.  The whole movie looks like it was filmed in the 1980s and takes place in a Cape-Cod type setting.  I ended up forwarding through most of it, watching the miracles and then the crucifixion.  The end was weird too, with no showing of the Resurrection, etc.  I'm just glad this was a bargain bin purchase...",1177891200,2,721,4.542635658914729
664256,2,6303455190,"""What was that?"" That was the question I couldn't help asking myself after watching this film. I liked the premise of trying to portray the events of Jesus' life in a modern setting because I thought that it might make Jesus' sacrifice for us more understandable and relevant to younger audiences (His sacrifice obviously has been, is, and will be relevant to all generations, but a majority of today's youth seem to have little understanding for anything that doesn't have to do with the 'here and now'). Unfortunately, this film failed in almost every respect.

If I hadn't read the movie description first, then I might only have had a vague notion that this was a retelling of Jesus' life until the time of Jesse's betrayal and execution. Part of me wants to watch the film again to see if I can pick up more of the contemporized events of Jesus' life, but a greater part of me says that I shouldn't waste my time by watching this again, because it certainly won't be the effective evangelistic tool that I (and probably the filmmakers) thought it could be.

It's a low-budget film and the acting is poor, as previous reviewers have already stated. These would be acceptable shortcomings if the story weren't so muddled. The unacceptable shortcomings are that there is little here that truly tells people what Jesus did and that what is contained in the movie is almost incomprehensible (and uninterestingly presented).

It's unfortunate that most Christian filmmakers have to cope with low budgets (which means no A-list actors most of the time), but a story can still be interestingly and effectively presented (""Flywheel"" is an excellent example of a low-budget Christian movie with less-than-stellar acting but a great, evangelistic story). If you want a ""What might have happened if Jesus had come to earth in our time?"" movie, then watch ""Joshua."" It's hardly a perfect film either, but it is a far better film than this one and, at the very least, it's comprehensible.",1160179200,5,1979,4.8664688427299705
664257,2,6303455190,"The acting in this film was stiff, as other reviewers have noted.  Peter seldom spoke, and seemed befuddled, rather than like the hothead Scriptures describe him as.  John the beloved had a rather silly smile, and said even less.  Judas was the most interesting character, and perhaps offered the best acting of the cast.  Another clumsy aspect was the mixture of modern setting and verbage with some cagey, King-Jamish sounding lines.  Jesse's modernized gospel occasionally took on a psychobabble character, such as when he said that it's not just life, but the quality of life that matters

The tempo was somewhat disjointed.  It would meander, then rush, then plod.  Thus, what should have been an interesting story, sometimes became laborious to watch.

Finally, the plot-line was decent, though uneven.  It roughly followed the New Testament accounts, but of necessity, only hit some highlights.

Bottom-line:  The Judas Project was a great idea that was rather poorly executed.  I note that both Amazon and another site I frequent for rentals, only gave this movie an overall two-stars.  This time, the crowd was quite accurate.  Two stars for a movie that did not waste my time, but did not entertain or deeply engage me, either.",1139443200,5,1237,5.054455445544554
664258,1,6303455190,"There are a few Christian films out there that try to promote their view point of Biblical stories in a way that both understands and successfully illustrates the love of God.  Unfortunately, there are also films that use heavy handed scare tactics in attempts to force people into believing it or else.  Interestingly enough, the contrived ""The Judas Project"" falls somewhere in between.

This oddball approach to the story of Jesus, as NOT presented in the four Gospels, transfers the most basic form of the story to America and sets it down in contemporary 1990.  In the film, ""Jesse"" (John O'Banion) shows up on the scene with no explanation or reference to the virgin birth.  He and his disciples, Pete (Ray Holtman) being among them, live together in a barn like structure located on the ocean front. Jude, an unbelieving type, is taken in and shown the truth by this savior.

At one point early in the film, Jesse takes Pete and two other disciples up on top of a mountain and reveals himself in spectacular 1980`s style effects.  Yes, big water color clouds, animated lightning, and Jesse transforming into a white robed and bearded Jesus Christ. Swirling lights become Moses and Elijah for a moment. One of the disciples feint in an attempt at comedy relief, though this is not needed as the film provides unintentional laughs throughout.

Jesse is shown performing very meager miracles as the film goes on, such as feeding fifteen people on the beach with cheese and bread, or telling a hooker that this isn't the life for her.  Jesse also foretells his death to his disciples, setting up things to come while the evil evangelical corporation (led by Richard Herd as Jerry Falwell look-alike Cunningham, standing in for Pontius Pilate) are out to indoctrinate him into their plans for world domination or else destroy him. Ponerous (Jeff Corey) is the true villain here though, snarling and fearing Jesse better than any Pharisee ever could. He was the best, hamming it up at every turn!

Things progress as assassination attempts are foiled at the hands of Jesse's super powers and such, until the point where Jude is paid thirty pieces of silver in a 1990's style briefcase, leading to gray jacket evangelical goons with Uzi weaponry capturing the would be messiah and his followers.  Trying desperately to retain something akin to the Bible, Pete denies Jesse three times.  Jesse has his shirt torn and is beaten. Jerry Falwell washes his hands of the situation, and evil snarling Ponerous decides to nail him up in the barn where he stayed, but not before evilly placing a crown of thorns on his head.

Now, the good part...a huge ""paint poured into large water tank"" storm approaches, casting an ominous shadow over the situation. Big animated lightning bolts start to fly from the God cloud ala Indiana Jones. God zaps the Uzi guys and also uses lightning to free the other disciples from their bonds.  Ponerous gets scared and makes a run for it, with God zapping his footsteps every minute. God chases Ponerous in all of his fury into an old cemetery, and then into a roofless but really big matte painting of a mausoleum. God exclaims that He never knew Ponerous, then all the crypts lids blow off. Spirits fly up into the lit up center of the God storm like something from a Spielberg oldie, including an up close special effect of a confederate general. Then fire shoots down and consumes evil Ponderous, leading to a really awesome shot of the matte painting of the mausoleum with a column of fire pouring into it!  If you didn't know that end times scripture comes along with Jesus...well, you do know!

Jesse dies, and his ghost leaves his body in a swirling gray pattern. Jude arrives after having flung his brief case of silver coins back over the fence of the huge evil evangelical empire's headquarters. He embraces Jesse and has flashbacks of how good he really was. Poor Jude, he has learned the truth and emerges as a tragic hero.

The film descends into a string of music videos to really bad Christian music and singing that tries its darndest to make you cry! We are then treated to a bumbling Pete trying to run up to the horse and buggy funeral procession with Jerry Falwell watching from the balcony of the evangelical headquarters. An officer of the law clubs poor Pete for daring to touch Jesse's coffin, but what is truly disturbing is the officer's giant sweat stain underneath his arm that the director chooses to zoom in on using slow motion!!! The awful series of horrendous songs continue.

Many flashbacks abound about how good Jesse was. Finally, in what seems an eternity of emotionally insipid singing, we are left with Pete standing over Jesse's grave at the beach. He asks forgiveness. Jesse appears to him and they embrace as credits roll.

I truly am flabbergasted by this film and the distorted version of the story of Jesus it presented, not to mention the death dealing version of God NOT taught by Christianity.  The acting is hideously bad, though I still recommend this film simply because I love those old ILM style effects and it was just so fun watching a guy get chased down and zapped ala Zeus!  Richard Edlund of Industrial Light & Magic fame was responsible for these special effects, so it is no wonder that images evoke fond memories of what we saw years ago in such blockbusters as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and POLTERGEIST.

If you are serious about your religion to such a degree that you cannot appreciate a comedy like this, then I would avoid it altogether.  I do, however, encourage all others to seek out a copy of this for immediate viewing, for it is guaranteed entertainment if you are feeling down!

It ignores the Last Supper, the Virgin Birth, and insults Christian's intelligence with its pandering psychobabble.  The acting is atrocious, the special effects mundane and the musical score is banal and uninspiring.  Their decision to make God vengeful and unforgiving at the Crucifixion is unforgivable.

7848712,2,6303455190,"The movie was awful, incompetent, boring, poorly acted and terrible directed with awful music.  So, why two stars instead of one?  Well, if you watch the movie with friends as a comedy, it borders on greatness.  There is so much about this film that will make you fall down laughing such as the cop's armpit, the weird scene where Jesse and Jude are having an 'intense' discussion and a lumberjack just appears in the middle of them out of the blue, the fact that just about every single person (if not every person) is obviously WASP..., the extra white part of a confederate officer being raised to Heaven, and many many more.  So, watch the movie, know that it is terrible, but with some good friends and the right attitude, you will enjoy it.",1417737600,,746,4.544776119402985
