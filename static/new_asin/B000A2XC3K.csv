2355167,2,B000A2XC3K,I don't care what MPI says about these being unedited episodes.  They have clearly been edited.  Why else would every single episode run exactly 24 minutes?  That's not just a coincidence.  Back in the early 1970s situation comedies were always slightly over 25 minutes in length.  A full minute has been cut from the Doris Day show.  Very disappointing.,1147824000,3,354,4.915254237288136
2355168,4,B000A2XC3K,Being a Doris Day and McLean stevenson fan both I just had to get this DVD. I love it. They are the best boss-employee duo. They are so bright and fun to watch (Stevenson is perhaps the slightly funnier of the two hey he was a comedian before going into acting but Day is nearly his comic equal and she's a better looker than him). The mixture of country-city comedy lends a certain credibility to the plots of the show rather than Doris living in the city she works in (as she later will). No I'm not related to their co-star Rose Marie.,1147305600,6,538,4.233009708737864
2355169,5,B000A2XC3K,The Doris Day Show - Season 2 is more great family entertainment. A great show for working Mothers - it shows how family is the most important and the kids come first no matter what. I truly enjoy this series.,1142467200,2,209,4.25
2355170,4,B000A2XC3K,"After a bucolic, kids-&-grandpa-on-the-farm first season, Doris Day and her producer-son Terry Melcher wisely moved much of the action on Day's hit TV sitcom away from the farm and had plucky widow Doris Martin conquering San Francisco. Grandpa and the two boys still play large roles, but the main focus has been shifted to Doris' workaday life at Today's World magazine, with boss McLean Stevenson and office co-hort Rose Marie. The shows still feel a bit under-nourished (and occasionally under-populated), and the set designs are cumbersome, but Doris is cute and had great fashion sense (she looks kicky in her midis and boots). The 4-disc set includes some priceless bloopers, behind-the-scenes shooting and outtakes, promos, the trailer for Day's ""The Tunnel of Love"", and a preview of Season Three (where Doris Martin actually moved to San Fran instead of being a commuter). Lots of fun!",1135814400,12,895,5.179310344827586
2355171,4,B000A2XC3K,"When I saw the first season (I bought it here), I didn't remember how good this show looked and how well it was produced.  I shouldn't have been surprised, Doris Day had been Hollywood's #1 female box office attraction in films for such a long time, CBS certainly wouldn't hold back the bucks on a star of her magnitude.

The network was so pleased to get Doris, they dealt her a ""Ft. Knox hand"" as Variety headlined.  CBS was weary of Lucille Ball threatening to leave if she didn't get more money at the conclusion of each contract, they felt that top movie queen, Doris Day, could quell the cantankerous Miss Ball.  Everybody expected fireworks between the two icons (Lucy of TV; Day of films). It didn't happen.  Both ladies had the utmost respect for the other's talent and legend, even posing for the press with one another.

The Doris Day Show was of much better quality than the overblown Here's Lucy or The Lucy Show or whatever Ms. Ball was doing at the time.  But, in the late 60s, during the beginning of the sexual revolution, Day was dissed because she was perceived as no longer being in the ""mainstream.""  She did not smoke pot or commit adultery in her films, her personal life was not in scandal (save for her name being briefly mentioned in the Charles Manson mess), so a certain portion of the public didn't feel that she was ""cool.""  They tried to make a joke out of Miss Day's clean living.  They failed.

The feelings about her lingered throughout the '70s and '80s (probably the reason this series was ignored for syndication).  In hindsight, perhaps that was a GOOD thing!  Now, the series is being greatly appreciated by Day's core fans and the legions of new ones (world-wide) who are just discovering this talented lady.

I look forward to the second season.",1123804800,47,1786,4.593059936908517
2355172,5,B000A2XC3K,"I have waited for years for this show to come out on DVD, I love the first season which I have been watching over and over again since I got it and I can't wait for season 2 which I have already preordered. Each season just gets better and better with this show. From the second season on, Doris is working in San Francisco and in season 3, moves to a fabo apartment in the city. Each season becomes more contemporary.  She was the first single working mom on tv and this was a full year before Mary Tyler Moore.  What most people don't realize is that ""The Doris Day show"" has more episodes and ran longer than the Brady Bunch. But since the show has not been seen since its original run people don't remember it. My friends who never saw it have LOVED it. The high production values and sets of the first season really impressed them.  This is a MUST have for any Doris fan. The opening credits of the seasons get better each year as well, topping off with the fabo sprial staircase entrance in the later seasons. A must have for any Doris fan.",1123545600,25,1046,4.2462311557788945
2355173,5,B000A2XC3K,"The recent release of the first season of ""The Doris Day Show"" has been one of the happiest surprises, for many, of the summer. The production values for the CBS series are exquisite and the quality of the DVD and bonuses elevate it to the top of the heap.

On the heels of that success, the second season of the hit series is due to be released in October of 2005 and as good as the first season is, the second was a knockout. It quickly became one of the top ten rated series on the air and it is easy to see why.

The second season combines the best of all worlds. Doris Martin, played by Miss Day, still resides on the family farm with her dad, played by Denver Pyle and her two sons, who are among the most likeable and believable child stars of the era, never resorting to cute. The change in the new season is that Doris Martin gets a job in San Francisco, working for a big magazine, thereby allowing the series to be more expansive. It also allows the introduction of additional characters at the magazine. They include Doris Martin's boss, played by McLean Stevenson, pre-""Mash"", RoseMarie who had recently stolen ""The Dick VanDyke Show"" from the stars of that series, and Paul Smith as Ron Harvey. Miss Day also had the opportunity to expand her wardrobe and reinforce the reasons for her being dubbed a fashion icon.

The storylines alternate between Doris Martin's new career and family matters back on the farm and sometimes the two world's meld most amusingly.

What can one say about Miss Day that hasn't been said for years. She is funny, warm, real, winning, a natural. She makes it seem so easy and her interactions with all the cast members never seems forced.  You almost feel as though you might be eavesdropping on real life.

The second season continued to boast a great line-up of guest stars and cast.  They included Larry Storch, making a couple of appearances as a boxer who is befriended by Miss Day, Billy DeWolfe, veteran of a couple of Day films from the early 50's as Mr. Jarvis, Edward Andrews, who had appeared in 3 films with Miss Day and became a semi-regular on the series as the magazine's publisher, Colonel Fairburn and Kaye Ballard and Bernie Kopell who in the series' third season would become regulars.

An interesting side-note for those who keep track of such things - Miss Day while growing up in Cincinatti, Ohio was a huge fan of the legendary Ginger Rogers.  During the series' second season, two of Miss Rogers' ex-husbands make guest apearances - Lew Ayres and Jacques Bergerac.

Lots of great extras and bonus materials are promised including new interviews with Storch and RoseMarie, a blooper reel, outtakes, a movie trailer, promos, etc. If they are half as good as the bonus materials provided on the first season, that alone makes this DVD worth the price. However, in addition, you get more than two dozen very funny episodes of a delightful series starring a lady who can bring a sunshine smile to the gloomiest of days. Anyone who suffers from Seasonal Affective Disorder should prepare for winter early and buy this show.  It is guaranteed to keep away the blues.",1121040000,61,3125,4.612612612612613
2355195,3,B000A2XC3K,"Loved Doris day in season one, but in season 2, her tv dad (Denver Pyle) and her kids take a back seat only to be phazed out completely in season 3 and onwards, as the stories became more and more predictable and sort of ""more of the same"" , hated RoseMarie, she looks like it's a pain to be in that show. Too bad because it would have been fun to see Doris raise her kids and have her dad around, but the producers went for the easy ""single"" working 'mom' storyline. I guess it was a good idea in the 60's but it doesn't age well. Doris Day was at her best in her movie career.",1426636800,2,578,3.948717948717949

2355202,5,B000A2XC3K,"I posted this on Turner Classic Movie's website also.

Doris gets a job as a secretary at Today's World magazine in San Francisco for the second season of the Doris Day Show.  She remains living on the farm with her father, Buck, and two sons.  However, Juanita, the maid from season one, is no longer on the show with no explanation.  I guess you assume she's no longer needed.  Leroy, the handyman, is also missing until episode ""The Gas Station"".  Leroy's character is now moved out and married.

Doris' new boss is played by McLean Stevenson.  He's the type of boss we'd all love to have.  He's very understanding with some of her mishaps like bringing a frog into work or helping Doris with the electric company arguing she didn't pay her bill.  Her boss even spends the Christmas holiday with her family on the farm.

Doris' new co-worker Myrna becomes her best friend.  The two of them have some adventures together, and at times they remind me of Lucy and Ethel from ""I Love Lucy"".  Doris and Myrna volunteer to run Leroy's Gas Station so he can visit his wife who's having a baby in the hospital and they rescue/steal poodles locked in a stranger's car, among other scenarios.

The storylines between the farm and Doris' office blend well together.

The special features, as with season one, are excellent.

One of Doris' favorite actors, Edward Andrews, guest stars as Colonel Fairburn in some episodes, who seems to be the head of Today's World.

As with season one, this is very good and very appropriate for all ages to enjoy.",1404345600,,1539,4.640740740740741

2355229,5,B000A2XC3K,"Season two of ""The Doris Day Show"" finds widow Doris Martin heading across the Golden Gate Bridge into a new world - ""Today's World,"" the aptly named magazine where Doris finds a job.  In 1969/70, she steps into new adventures of working and dating in San Francisco giving the show a modern, urban feel, all the while experiencing the sweetness of living on the farm with her father and two boys.  It was the best of both worlds.

Denver Pyle, Philip Brown and Tod Starke continue as Doris' father, Buck, and her young boys Billy and Toby, respectively.  They bring a sunny appeal and some realism as Doris tries to balance work and dating with motherhood.  This dynamic is seen in a few episodes:  ""Doris Strikes Out"" has Doris umpiring Billy's overtime baseball game while trying to make it to a premier with a French actor; ""The Chocolate Bar War"" has Doris battling with a woman over Scout candy, not knowing that she is the wife of an important client for ""Today's World.""

New to the series & a welcome addition was McLean Stevenson as Doris' boss; Rose Marie as Myrna, the self-deprecating co-worker/friend and Paul Smith, Myrna's loopy, skirt-chasing boss.  The show worked when mixing the farm and city worlds:  Doris bringing the boys to Myrna's pool to help her get out of a bad lease, Myrna and the bosses working at the farm due to a measles' outbreak.  One of my favorite episodes is ""A Two-Family Christmas,"" which shows this cross-over with an office Christmas party and one at home.

Another favorite episode is ""Doris the Model,"" where Doris has to fill in for a model at a fashion show.  The premise is goofy, but who cares...the whole point is to see the beautiful Ms. Day wear pretty clothes.  There are hats aplenty, including some very fuzzy ones, and she breaks out a long wig straight out of the Malibu Barbie collection.  She looks radiant no matter what, but a couple of outfits are hilarious - a bright yellow coat, for one, with feathers down the front, reminiscent of Big Bird.  An unintentionally funny moment is when she dons a grey, palazzo-pant jumpsuit and poses a la Captain Morgan with her leg in the air.  Doris fans will recognize music from her movie ""Pillow Talk"" as she models the gold dress.  The fashion show became a tradition, with Doris in some predicament each season that forces her into modeling.

There are 25 episodes, the quality and color are great.  Extras include: network promos, outtakes and interviews from Rose Marie and Larry Storch, who was a guest on a few episodes.

Whether she's on the farm or at work, Doris will bring laughter and sunshine into your world.",1334448000,,2624,4.675381263616558

2355231,5,B000A2XC3K,"I must admit I was looking forward to seeing The Doris Day Show after only having read about it in TV history and reference books for the last 15 years or so. The most intriguing aspect of the series seemed to be its constantly changing premise. I pre-ordered Season One and I confess it took me nearly two years to work my way through it. It began as a charming, low-key sitcom typical of its era, but quickly became boring with many plots seemingly lifted from The Andy Griffith Show. Doris and her co-stars were much better than the material. The farm in Mill Valley was just not the right setting for her. Although she looked great in all her scenes, she was frequently seen in jeans and shirts, which did absolutely nothing to highlight her fabulous fashion sense or incredibly youthful figure.

Only more than halfway into the first season, in the ""Fly Boy"" episode (one of the better entries this season) do we get to see Doris decked out in a breathtaking black fishtail gown and realize how stifling the farm setting is to her as a character and an actress. The producers may have realized it too, because it seems from this point forward, the later episodes of the first season tend to have perkier plots and execution.

The character of Leroy B. Simpson becomes very tiresome in Season One. Although James Hampton is a fine actor, the character is too much of a Gilligan-type bumbler to stomach in large doses. There was only room on CBS for one comedic farmhand, and sorry Leroy, but that award went to Green Acres' Eb Dawson.

And so, after a dreary first season with an overdose of bucolic flavor, The Doris Day Show amazingly takes an instant upward turn as soon as our leading lady walks through the doors of Today's World magazine. She accepts a position as secretary to the managing editor, played by McLean Stevenson. Add to this a feisty co-worker played by none other than former Dick Van Dyke Show star Rose Marie, well-written, fast-paced stories and you've got a season that more than makes up for the lackluster episodes we endured throughout Season One.

Doris exudes great chemistry with her new co-stars. Rose Marie adds the much-needed contrast to Doris and comic edge that was missing the first season with Naomi Stevens as the sweet-tempered Juanita. Their teaming provides some of the best installments this season, as seen in ""The Gas Station"". This episode also brings back James Hampton as Leroy, who is much more appealing in his guest shots than he was a series regular, as the writers seem to have given him slightly more intellect.

The balance between Doris' home life on the farm and professional life at Today's World is executed perfectly, with just enough time devoted to the characters of Buck, Billy and Toby as to keep them involved in the storylines without becoming too boring.

The character of Doris Martin also sports an amazingly hip look this season, most notably in the use of a long blonde fall which instantly dates the show but makes its leading lady look at least 10 years younger. Beginning with the fashion show episode ""Doris the Model"", the show takes every advantage to show off Miss Day's wholesome beauty in the best possible light.
Had I known the series was going to improve so drastically this second year, I may have decided to skip the first season altogether and go straight to this. (Being a completist, however, that was out of the question). On its best days, The Doris Day Show was as good as, or perhaps better than That Girl.

If you tested the waters with Season One and found it too slow-moving for your taste, take my word for it--you won't be disappointed with this set because the series does a complete about-face.",1185580800,17,3698,4.68

Both seasons included guest spots, a variety of entertainers from variety and vaudville. Season 2 has more comedic and vaudville type style and interstates new storyline of Doris working in San Francisco. Personally, I enjoyed the shows that focused on the children, as in season 1, which was more dramatic with a sprinkle of humor, and always a lesson.
Season 2, still has her father and kids, but their storylines are fewer. First 2 disks show kids more, now on disk 3, stories gravitate her work, and her father is in a few still. I enjoy the guest stars but I'm already feeling disappointed in lack of storylines around the kids, as in season 1
was so quant and refreshing to see positive parenting, by a single mom, and the children learning a variety of lessons.
As I said before this is a personal preference per viewer of these shows, and really depends on what your looking for in a classic television show.
I enjoyed the Christmas episode the best,
integrating the office people with Doris's family. Some segments she wears her hair long! Still better then today's tv, but this season shifted focus from season 1.
