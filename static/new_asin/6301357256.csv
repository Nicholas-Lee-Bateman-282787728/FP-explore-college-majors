333336,1,6301357256,The DVD took a long time to arrive.  I know I purchased a Used DVD but it will not work.  I tried it in 3 different DVD players.  I guess it is just a chance we take.,1293408000,,166,3.4324324324324325
333337,3,6301357256,"Here's a different story: funny and appealing for awhile. I say ""awhile"" because on the third viewing of this, I must have gotten ""righteous"" because I did not appreciate adultery, pre-marital sex and sex with minors as something to be glamorized. It was in this film, sad to say.

Still,  it is a fun movie to watch if you've never seen it before. The bright colors in here, the 1940s mood and atmosphere, a great '40s soundtrack and some genuinely funny moment and scenes all are pluses. The only question is: where's the DVD?

Apparently based on a true-life story of a kid called Ellsworth """"Sonny"" Wisecarver, Patrick Dempsey plays the 15-year-old kid who married two adult women in the 1940s, causing scandals. In this movie, Wisecarveer is made out to be a lovable, naive, romantic and sympathetic figure despite the fact he is an immoral idiot!

The first woman he's involved with, ""Judy Cusimano,"" is played by a pretty actress with whom I am not familiar: Talia Balsam. She reminded me of Lea Thompson. According to her filmography, she's done mostly TV work since this movie. Anyway, ""Judy"" and ""Sonny"" certainly make a strange pair. There are some funny lines between them, but she's as morally bankrupt as him.

After those two are quickly discovered and the marriage dissolved, Sonny is now the attraction of older women everywhere. It doesn't take long for Beverly D'Angelo enters the picture as ""Francine Glatt"" being second important adult woman in Sonny''s odd life.  I'll leave it there!",1235606400,3,1506,4.886274509803922

333339,4,6301357256,"It is impossible for me to objectivley look at any other 80's teeny-bopper movies without thinking of how terribly they faulter in comparison to this movie.  Jack Dempsey is just such a lovable guy that it's easy to see why all the older women go for him.  Sure, I'll admit, it's definatley a ""chick flick"" but I really just can't help in saying this movie is all around great.  I was in such a good mood after seeing it.  So if you are ever in the video store and you happen to stumble upon this awesome movie (with an even better soundtrack than I thought humanly possible) you might want to try picking this one up for a little variety.  It will make you want to fall in love... *sigh*",986169600,9,688,4.2615384615384615
333340,4,6301357256,"This is a cute movie that exemplifies the trials and tribulations of teenhood.  Adding to the fact that it is based on a true story, is the light mood and comedic take-off of stressful situations.  It will tug at your heartstrings if you are seeking the love of your life.  The main character tries to fight his optomistic side, and loses.  ""Everything will be great!"" is his motto.  Yes, it is kind of a 'chick-flick' but it also is a good example to men as to exactly what women are looking for.",973728000,7,497,4.358695652173913

7812457,5,6301357256,"Good fun movie. Patrick Dempsey is totally irresistible.  He is so charming that the ladies can't stay away from him. On a side note, I was disappointed to learn that this DVD doesn't have the closed captioning option.  I was able to get through the movie without it.  I missed a few minor scenes, but could understand everyone through most of the film.",1452729600,,353,4.571428571428571

7812459,5,6301357256,This is a great movie and an unbelievable one at that.  True story about a guy named Sonny and it takes place in the 40's.  Patrick Dempsey is a great actor and he played the part of Sonny very well.  Very entertaining movie and out it on your Bucket List as a must see.,1410220800,,270,3.962962962962963
7812460,5,6301357256,I was searching for this movie for quite a while.  I really love this movie which was funny and had its serious moments too.,1408492800,,124,4.166666666666667
7812461,3,6301357256,"I remembered seeing this movie years ago and wondering what the big deal about this tale was.  This is certainly a ""chick flick"" as it's a romantic comedy about something that we look at today and think ""what's the big deal?""  Because in 1944, Elsworth ""Sonny"" Wisecarver, aka the ""Woo Woo Kid,"" a 15-year-old who had his 15 minutes of fame for running off with two much older women during World War II.  In his day, that was something unheard of.

This movie is odd on many levels in that so many things have come full circle.  In 1987 when this movie was made, it was unheard of that a younger man would have an affair with an older woman (married or not).  Now, it's every young man's fantasy to have an experienced, sophisticated older woman rather than a girl their own age.  Patrick Dempsey had a second wind with his career on Grey's Anatomy but this was part of his decade genre of his being a happy, bumbling fool being chased after by older women.  The girls who used to shun him suddenly are all over him like a teen idol because he's famous.  And perhaps the greatest irony, some argue that Sonny started the sexual revolution.  True?  Well, if we came across a story like this today we would hardly bat an eye at it.

Sonny was just an average 15 year old kid living in California when he ran off with a neighbor's wife in her thirties.  While doing his DH time, he worked at a bunny farm (that is so cute to see all the bunnies he sets free when he runs away) then ran away to have an affair with another older, married woman.  What can I say but times were different then and we have since let go of those old Victorian values and now have an ""anything goes"" attitude.  Are we better because of this?  Not exactly, we're just different rather than truly free.  Have we become better people since adopting this attitude?  Not really, we're different.

This was a snapshot of what the world was.  Have fun with it.",1370736000,,1927,4.34453781512605
7812462,4,6301357256,"This movie is very funny. It's hard to catch on TV, so I decided to buy it. The video to DVD transfer is very good in quality. Patrick Dempsey was very good for this type of movies when he was young (Can't Buy Me Love is another).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-The-Mood/dp/B003IQ5S32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In The Mood</a>",1351382400,2,368,6.096153846153846
7812463,5,6301357256,"The true story of Elsworth ""Sonny"" Wisecarver, aka the ""Woo Woo Kid,"" a 15-year-old who had his 15 minutes of fame for running off with two much older women during World War II, and became a national obsession.

One of my all-time favorite movies, an example of how awesome movies are when everything clicks -- writing, directing, casting, acting, and score (including a nearly all-Glenn Miller soundtrack in addition to the theme song of the title).

Patrick Dempsey gives one of his best and most charming performances in the lead role and Talia Balsam is perfectly cast as his first older woman.  But Beverly D'Angelo steals the show in her brief turn as Sonny's second love interest, from the moment she ""appears"" (offscreen, voice only).  She also sings two of the songs in the soundtrack and does a great job.

The whole cast is absolutely perfect, with lots of familiar faces.

I couldn't believe WB didn't release this on DVD years ago, and apparently now they're making them up out of their archive as ordered.

The good news is they digitized an apparently fresh print with very few flaws and great color registration for the DVD (only, no bluray) format disc.  Bad news is, no special features at all, not even the 10-minute mini-doc featuring an interview with the real-life Woo Woo Kid that graces the VHS version.

This film is still a treasure and very much worth owning.  I guess I should make a habit of becoming obsessed with more mainstream fare  lol",1294963200,6,1469,4.744094488188976
