8566681,5,B006M5AML4,"Very much a great midwestern independent film, with an honest heart that really strikes a chord across any person's lifetime. The emotions are familiar, the situations feel very home-like, and the friendships are deep and true. Truly a touching performance, one I won't soon forget! I would recommend this to any film lover, drama lover, or indie lover!",1337558400,,353,5.103448275862069
