8612532,1,B00F61B25U,"A likely made originally for TV movie 2012's Deadly Obsession is one to get only if you're really into watching movies that are so bad they're enjoyable because they are so badly written.  Basically this is a school shooting movie, at a really small town university where classes take place in the library. A patient of a psychiatrist who also teaches a tutorial class on the subject decides to pay his doctor a visit at her second job, he brings a gun with him.  It's never really explained why, but he starts shooting students in the library as he's making his way to where he expects her class to be.  Unfortunately for him (fortunately for her class) she has been moved to a different room, and when the shots sounded, got the students to push a table up against the door.  Oddly none of these students do the common sense thing of getting out of the line of fire by getting behind stuff and crouching as low to the ground as possible.  So a kid who has a crush on the teacher gets a few bullets go through him.  The psychiatrist gets the students to go down into the basement to hide, but the shot kid is obviously in bad shape.  A red head, and seriously contender for biggest bimbo in a horror/thriller film of all time, likes to talk really loudly constantly whenever they are supposed to be hiding.  So do some other students.

Spoilers - Meanwhile the overweight small town police chief who keeps hassling our bimbo redhead in the coffee shop she works in (on the day of the shooting before she went to class he actually gives the coffee he supposedly wants to a kid on another table to hold, then after telling off the victim of a hit and run outside the shop upon seeing the bimbo walk off with the injured kid forgets all about his coffee and walks off), just stands with his patrol car door open outside of the school, with a couple of other officers doing the same thing.  Until that is the boyfriend of the psychiatrist walks right up to him, demands to know the situation and tells him he's going in because he's been in the military, and they'll be dead in the 45 minutes the police chief told him would take a S.W.A.T. team to arrive.  The chief lets him after checking he's brought his own gun to a school full or petrified students trying to avoid a guy in street clothes carrying a gun. Another officer suggests it might be a good idea to set up a temporary crime scene headquarters so they go into the library with the army guy and set up an office in a room there, sit at desks, start making photocopies and stuff, but don't actually go into the rest of the library to get any wounded kids out or stop the gunman.  They don't even have any officers in the hallways outside the office, just in case the gunman decides to come that way.  At times other people will run into the temporary headquarters room with everyone in the room turning round and suddenly noticing them.

Throughout the film we have a number of flashback session and elsewhere scenes between the psychiatrist and the school shooter.  We also have a number of flashback scenes for other characters, it seems everyone in this town always goes to the one coffee shop.  The gunman early on tells the cop that no one can leave because he's barricaded all the doors. We only ever see a bike chain on one door, and when he finds the university lecturer, the lecturer asks him to let these girls go, he does, so how do they get out?  In fact all the corpses of the students seem to disappear when the gunman walks back through a room, or when he hears bimbo airredhead shouting in a phone.  The biggest question of all though, why would you throw what the psychiatrist does onto the floor?",1492992000,,3673,4.4002954209748895

So glad I have finally had the opportunity to buy the film.",1398643200,,267,4.018867924528302
