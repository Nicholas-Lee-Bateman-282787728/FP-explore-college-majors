2238077,5,B0007R8FOE,I bought this based on the 3 positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this dvd. Great music and very interesting character studies. Five stars with no reservation IMHO.,1174262400,4,191,5.0

2238079,5,B0007R8FOE,"This is the real deal...back-porch players in their own delta environment who don't give a tinker's damn about anything but playing their music, drinkin', and enjoying what's left of thier time on earth. Their sensibility is miles away from the music business as we know it, and thank God for it because most people are completely oblivious to southern blues musician mindset and would probably never have a chance to ""get it"" otherwise because most of these players are truly a dying breed.

This film captures the heart and spirit of real African-American bluesmen who are still poor after being semi-famous for years...and they really couldn't care less. R. L. Burnside in particular has been releasing albums and playing around for years, been reviewed and celebrated in all the best rock and indie-alternative press, and still lives like any poor, black rural working man. These guys don't care about fancy boutique amps and expensive ""guitar show"" instruments. They make all the sound they need from a typical hodge-podge of beat up pawn shop instruments, playing in some cases with simple buttern knives when their hands no longer work.

If you understand the connection that the ancient African music traditions have to roots American music, look no further than this movie as an example of how it was preserved and passed on in the new world to this present day. This film may be one of the last testaments to a culture that will surely disappear soon in this 21st century.",1123372800,49,1482,4.924
2238080,5,B0007R8FOE,"if you enjoy music, you will enjoy this dvd. this is the real deal. these guys don't care about careers, success etc. this is pure art, pure emotion. if you watch this (and it resonates, i.e. you ""get it"") most other music will become irrelavant.",1115683200,24,246,4.488888888888889

2238084,5,B0007R8FOE,"""You See Me Laughin"" is flat out awesome and documents the bluesmen as real people-deeply flawed and yet able to create transcendent music out of their lives of privation, criminality, abuse and desperation-everything the blues should be! The footage of Cedell Davis alone is worth the price.",1312243200,,292,5.23404255319149
2238085,5,B0007R8FOE,"If you are looking for a true Mississippi Delta Blues experience, try this one out. The DVD portrays a look into the daily lives and life experiences of some the great bluesmen of that era.",1293667200,2,189,4.428571428571429
2238086,3,B0007R8FOE,"Very disappointed after buying this because of all the good reviews. I don't have a problem with ""raw and primitive or noisy"". However what i see here is the sad very last reserve of old men making blues based noise on terribly out of tune guitars. OK this was not nice and a bit exaggerated. But not more than claiming that a guy who due to several illnesses and handicaps can hardly raise his hands not to speak of moving his fingers is the last survivor who can play like the old blues heroes of the 1930s. And while that Fat Possum stuff might have been finally successful and found its audience - i don't see any connection to the sound of the great 1930s blues recordings as they claim at some point. Still worth a look as for what it is. Sorry for my bad english.
Imagine I (the typical mid aged balding white guy) would join a local blues jam and play like that...",1293235200,2,872,4.259036144578313
2238087,5,B0007R8FOE,"I grew to know RL Burnside from his work with the Blues Explosion - as an aging punk, I love punk blues.
Simple, repetitive and rhythmic.
If anyone I know is having a bad day, I say ""watch this and meet Cedel, how bad is your life?""!!
For me, it was much more enjoyable for its rawness than ""Deep Blues"".",1290470400,4,304,4.083333333333333

2238089,5,B0007R8FOE,"An incredibly moving and inspiring peek into the lives and music of several hard-core Bluesmen who lived almost until the end of the 20th century. The quality of sound and video varies and some of it is not very high but that doesn't really matter given the depth and beauty of the content. If you're into the true deep Blues and want to see the real descendants of Son House, Robert Johnson, Freed McDowell and Bukka White they're right here.",1267315200,9,443,4.55
2238090,4,B0007R8FOE,"You see me laughin' is an extraordinary documentary film that takes you into the backwoods where the Black blues players reside.  You see them amongst their surroundings, their kinfolk, the room where they play, the porch where they hangout and get their inspiration. Unless you've been there into the backwoods, you wouldn't have guessed that within this sparse surrounding, the world exists in simplicity and purity which allows the blues musician to find his stories.  Of course, everyone has the blues, but this style is the rural adaptation, not the citified urban blues that we're used to hearing. And when you hear the blues being talked about from the musician's own mouth, there is a greater impact, than simply reading text in a book.  I liked this video and would recommend it to all of you who are curious about how the country blues got started, who played it, and how important these musicians were to the development of blues as it reached the big cities ... Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, New York, etc.",1256601600,10,1017,4.833333333333333

2238092,4,B0007R8FOE,This is a very good doc. that ties these delta blues musicians in with the idea of punk music in many ways. It's always refreshing to see real people doing real things just because they want to. You can't fake or replace that. I could do without the Bono (or however you spell that goon from U2's name) interview. Where did that come from? he doesn't fit into any of the rest of this video at all. The first time i saw this video on TV it was after his interview and i must say that he almost ruins the whole thing. You're better off starting the video after his interview so he doesn't have a chance to take away from the realness of the rest of everyone else in it. Worth the watch!,1238889600,4,684,4.111940298507463
2238093,5,B0007R8FOE,you will more than appreciate this movie. It gives a great look into the lives of some of the best musicians Fat Possum... nay... the world has to offer. What they say will astonish you... from hearing about murder and hard times growing up... and what they play and how they play it will make you realize either that you have been missing out on good music or that you have always known you listened to such good music for a reason.,1233360000,2,433,4.2926829268292686
2238094,5,B0007R8FOE,"A moving documentary of the struggles of not only the musicians but of two men trying to record, promote, and preserve a form of the blues that is truly original, timeless, and captivating. Both the musicians and producers are clearly not in it for the money because there is none. No this is clearly done for the love of the music. I do not wish to prejudice anyones opinion of the film prior to viewing so I'll just leave it for you to enjoy.",1221782400,,444,4.2976190476190474
2238095,5,B0007R8FOE,"If any music DVD is a prime example of the old adage ""when you find a good chord, stick to it"" this one is it.  It is a fascinating look at the lives of some great rural blues musicians and a lesson that blues music does not need to be complex to be powerful.  These guys play the simplest of riffs yet still make the hairs on your neck stand on end.  Great stuff and a lesson to all the Eric Clapton wanabees.",1206835200,25,410,3.9156626506024095
2238096,5,B0007R8FOE,"""You See Me Laughin""!  If you like your blues with grit, then get this video.  The interviews with T-Model, Rule Burnside, and especially Cedell's story are worth the price of admission with the added bonus of footage from Junior Kimbrough's JukeJoint.

I've bought a few good ones lately but this video is probably the best in the collection.

2238098,5,B0007R8FOE,"This documentary is nothing short of amazing. The constant undertow of great blues music and the musical cadence of the storytelling bluesmen make the experience of watching hypnoticly compelling. I can watch this again and again. I love sharing it with others too.

This is not just for music snobs and know-it-alls. Whether you are already a fan of the genre, or someone who knows nothing about the blues, but just like the sound, you will be drawn in. Not at all dry or overproduced, never boring, this low-budget doc is close to perfect. I've bought the music of all the performers as a result. I'm sure they've already blown their share of the money on something. :)",1198108800,,671,4.686440677966102
2238099,5,B0007R8FOE,"A snapshot of the last of the true Mississippi bluesmen, the movie takes a fantastic look at what real blues are all about.  We get a peek at the troubled lives of some of the most unfamous and superstitious guitar pickers in the most backward area of the deep south.  Think you have troubles?  Get ready for true stories of killing, gambling, womanizing, affliction, and the music that surrounded it all.  Amazing.",1197590400,,415,4.722222222222222
2238100,5,B0007R8FOE,"Rock and Roll is the prototypal American music.  Maybe Jazz was at one time, but it's Rock now, and has been for the last 50 years.  Where did rock come from?  A smattering of Jazz may have been involved, but Rock mainly arose from the atomic explosion that was black Mississippi delta blues traveling North, and running smack dab into white Appalachian hillbilly music travelling West.  The mushroom cloud rose over Memphis, and on top of it sat the teenaged Elvis Presley.  But what was Elvis listening to?  Where did he get his raw material?

One of the two sources is on this DVD.  Like an archeaological expedition, the filmmakers unearth an untouched civilization:  Mississippi hill country blues in an amazing, extant form:  THIS is the music, the sounds that travelled North, that reverberated 50 years ago out of the Delta to catch the imaginations of young people all over the world - everyone from the aforementioned Mr. Presley to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones on the other side of the pond.  They recycled it, and sent it back to us.  This is ground zero for Rock.  Just as an embryo mutates, develops, and finally morphs into something quite unrecognizable from its original form, so has Rock moved many varied distances from its roots.  But roots there are, and this is about as close as you're going to get without reading about it in some ""History of Rock"" book.  This IS the history.  Enjoy.",1174953600,8,1414,4.710204081632653
8050952,4,B0007R8FOE,"To be sure, this is not a concert video. This is the root of Fat Possum Records, with interviews and footage of some of Fat Possum's original artists. You want to know where the blues comes from ?  Here you are.
Very real, very raw.
While this might not be a video you watch over and over again, I love the footage, especially R.L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough.

8050955,5,B0007R8FOE,"I admit, I'm a Blues purist. When people debate who is the best Bluesman, or the best modern day day bluesman, and people respond Bonamassa, or Mayer, or someone similar. I laugh, and say it is some unknown man about 60 years old playing on his front porch in Mississippi. To me that is the real blues and nothing is better. Not even a man who plays out of tune, and sings off key.

I applaud the boys from Fat Possum records who want to preserve the music. I just hope there are more RL Burnsides and Junior Kimbroughs out there.",1490572800,4,530,4.247524752475248
