8153957,5,B000K2ALT8,"I recommend to buy all the 3 dvds to make your trick training set complete since there are so many tricks one can teach a horse!
Carole Fletcher explains these tricks very well: how trick training is built on the pillars of 3 P's (perseverance, patience, praise), what equipment to use, the cues, and especially how one trick builds progressively on another.
It would have been fun to show progressive stages of training and 'what to do if my horse doesn't respond' though, but I guess that is fun of doing it yourself and thinking of the 3 P's you can't go wrong!",1383350400,,564,4.485436893203883
