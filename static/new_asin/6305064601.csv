961178,2,6305064601,"Though it gives a behind the scenes view of the Cannes Film Festival and the movie business, it is so not funny and sickenly cynical.  The movie was so bad I felt myself losing intelligence just watching it! Unbelievable.
The only good scene is with Johnny Depp meditating and smoking with the director of Dead Man. The scene is funny, making fun at himself and the whole celebrity scene making it seem so bizarre.
Note:  This film would be good for anyone involved in the film business, but I would NOT recommend it for us moviegoers.",1007251200,,535,4.5625
7882304,5,6305064601,"I had never heard of this movie and just found it while browsing on Amazon.
So funny and thoroughly enjoyable.  I especially love the scene where Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch are 'in another world'.",1429747200,,198,4.6571428571428575
7882305,5,6305064601,Must see for anyone who wants to visit Cannes!!!,1424390400,,48,4.444444444444445
7882306,5,6305064601,I am collecting all of Johnny Depp's movies and this is one more added to my collection which is one more closer to having a complete collection of movies.,1378857600,,155,4.379310344827586
7882307,3,6305064601,"It is different even for Johnny.  Not the best movie that he has been in, but Johnny was in it and I collect and added this.",1353110400,,124,3.769230769230769
7882308,1,6305064601,"Really boring film.  It is nothing but Hollywood insider humor (and most of that is nothing but petty bitchery) and cameos.  If you like to see ""stars"" sitting around talking (blah, blah, blah) and think that is funny, by all means - this is the film for you.",1191024000,,259,4.375
7882309,1,6305064601,"the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie.",1110412800,,276,4.653061224489796
7882310,1,6305064601,"This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him.",1110412800,10,521,4.580645161290323
7882311,5,6305064601,"Cannes Man was funny.  I don't know why this movie was in the drama section of Blockbuster, but it made me laugh out loud. Just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland, and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who don't know their **s from a hole in the ground.",1013299200,,278,4.148148148148148
7882312,5,6305064601,"I've been to Cannes and this film captures it to a T.  If you're looking for a Johnny Depp film, this isn't it - he does a ten minute cameo in it with Jim Jarmusch.  But it's the funniest ten minutes I've ever seen Johnny Depp be.  If you are interested in film festivals, or wanted to know what the real Cannes festival is like, this video is hilarious.",1013299200,12,354,4.101449275362318
