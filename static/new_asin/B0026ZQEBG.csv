8353801,1,B0026ZQEBG,"I'm a pretty easy going guy, look at movies not for their reality content but for entertainment and enjoyment. I routinely disregard bad reviews by ""the pros"" and will make up my own mind-more often than not completely disagreeing with their assessment. With this movie, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU!

This was without a doubt the poorest, most juvenile, poorly acted POS I have ever seen. It makes ""Ishtar"" & ""Showgirls"" look like Academy Award quality movies. I was saying to friends that it looked like a art class project, but that was slanderous to student film makers.",1256169600,5,572,4.777777777777778
