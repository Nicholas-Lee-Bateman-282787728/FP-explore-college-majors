8568028,1,B00BG6JRNI,"I was shocked to see this is actually a renamed good copyright ""Unknown Island"" which is available elsewhere on Amazon from the copyright owner. Cinecolor wasn't great to start with, but this transfer, apparently from used release print, is really second-rate.",1381536000,,260,5.365853658536586
8568029,3,B00BG6JRNI,"I may be off-base here, but I can't find ""Jurassic Terror of Unknown Island"" on IMDB. I assume the movie in question is ""Unknown Island"" starring Barton Maclane and Phillip Reed (not Phil Maclane) and Virgina Grey and Richard Denning (not Virginia Denning). The director was Jack Bernhard, similar enough to Jock Burnside?

If the film is ""Unknown Island"", it is a decent picture. The slow-moving dinosaurs are a bit laughable, but it is nice to see a film from the period not relying on stock-footage from ""1 Million B.C."" If it is not ""Unknown Island"", then I suspect the film is a tribute or take-off on the basis of the similarity of the assumed names of the cast, the souped up title, and the plot description. The best tributes are of the science fiction films of the 1950s (e.g., ""Alien Trespass"", ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""), not 1948, but such would be welcome.

The stars in my review are for ""Unknown Island"", which I have seen and which is already available on DVD.",1363564800,4,977,4.641618497109826
