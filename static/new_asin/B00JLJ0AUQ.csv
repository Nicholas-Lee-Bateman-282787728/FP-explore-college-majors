6380965,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Great atmospheric horror/thriller! This is more creepy atmosphere, sense of foreboding, and story line than blood or gore. It has a similar feel to ""The Orphanage"" rather than Freddy or Jason. Very good; some plot points and direction don't make a lot of sense at first, but the movie brings it all together by the end. Lots of creepy things happening and a fantastic story. Don't miss it!",1407456000,16,389,4.735294117647059
6380966,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,5 star MYSTERY!  I would categorize this movie as a mystery rather than a horror (not that it isn't creepy).  Truly enjoyed this one!!!,1407196800,,135,4.583333333333333
6380967,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"I love it when a horror film can capture the dark, eerie tones of the old Hammer films.  Hammer was renowned for its ability to conjure foreboding atmospheres in the most common of places, therefore when a modern-day director can do that, its a true testament to his or her talents.  Such is the case with NEVERLAKE.  Director Riccardo Paoletti draws on age-old mysticism and folklore to help set the tone of his filmand the result is an effective horror flick that entertains on several levels.

I honestly didn't expect much from this film going into it.  Not that I thought it was going to be bad or anything, but the premise didn't engage me as much as others have.  But thankfully, I was WAY off base.  NEVERLAKE is a fun and haunting film that every horror fan should check out soon.

NEVERLAKE is shot well and looks very good onscreen.  I particularly like the sweeping landscape shots interspersed throughout; they are a huge help in setting the tone for the film, and they also highlight the beautiful Italian countryside in which the film is shot and set.

The acting is solid with several enjoyable performances.  Daisy Keeping, who plays the lead character, is entertaining and a name to look for in the future.  I hope to see more of her work soon.  The rest of the cast does a good job as well, including Martin Kashirokov as Peter and David Brandon as Dr. Brook.

But although NEVERLAKE is entertaining and visually excellent, it does have a couple of flaws.  First and foremost, the plot takes a while to get moving.  The movie clocks in at only 86 minutes, however the opening scenes are slow, which slows the tension from building.  Secondly, some of the storyline later on gets a tad confusing, especially when the horrifying medical discovery is madein connection with the three thousand year old spirits.  This concept actually took me a few minutes to digest.

However, NEVERLAKE is a creepy film with lots of surrealistic and beautiful imagery.  Despite its minor negatives, it is definitely one to see.  The film has a varied release schedule, so be sure to catch it at one of the locations above.",1405900800,18,2122,4.681081081081081
6380968,3,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Strange twists abound in this story of a lake in Tuscany, Etruscan idols with magical powers, a girl whose father and housekeeper are using her for nefarious ends, and several kids in a nearby facility.  Odd and unpredictable.",1405123200,9,226,4.947368421052632

6380970,3,B00JLJ0AUQ,"This is not an ordinary horror film. It is more mystery than horror. Jenny (Daisy Keeping) has been away living with grandma Rose and then a boarding school. She takes off from boarding school to visit her estranged British father (David Brandon) near Lake Arezzo, Tuscany. It was here the ancient Etruscans would toss idols in the lake for healing purposes.

Dad is a doctor and is very stealthy. He ignores his daughter to her dismay and she is at odds with Olga (Joy Tanner ) the house keeper. Jenny meets a strange group of children who live in a weird nearby hospital. She visits and reads to them.

Jenny loves literature. She narrates about life and the lake usually quoting the poems of Shelly.

The film moved slow but was engaging. Some scenes gave me flashbacks to  ""Lady in the Water"" which the film has nothing in common. I liked the idea of using the Lake of Idols and Etruscans as a background. I kept hoping they weren't going to make the Etrucans aliens. When the mystery was solved, I felt it was a let down. It was like adding a limerick to a Shelly poem.  A ""B"" ending to what was developing to be an ""A"" mystery.

Better than most Redbox ""B"" horror rentals.

I stuck with it and did enjoy it.  It is not a slasher, scary,  bumps in the night ghost story.  So if you looking for fast paced, this is not it.",1513382400,,295,3.7540983606557377
6380977,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,The cover art and blurb do not do this movie justice.  It is rich in Italian history as well as psychological horror and drama.  I have now watched it three times and see something new each time I watch.  I highly recommend this for a rainy evening in or anytime you are wanting a good movie to watch.  Much better than low star reviews portray!,1510790400,,345,4.2615384615384615

6380979,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,This is actually a pretty good story. The acting isn't stellar but the story line is very good and it does have a creepy plot to it. Surprising ending as well. It's worth watching and I'm glad I decided to give it a try.,1506643200,,220,4.0227272727272725
6380980,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"This wasn't what I expected. Well acted, well scripted, beautifully filmed, nice music score, etc.. The scariest thing about this movie was it contained real monsters, human monsters. Selfish people wrapped up in their own little world so that no one else matters. The depths of depravity of the human soul is boundless. Yes there are some incongruous parts but over all a well made film. Anyone watching this film may be haunted by their own past, their own parents, or if you are a parent your own motives for having children. Since this took place overseas (Italy) and if you have never lived abroad you do not know how this could be a very real terror in other countries. I was both entertained and disturbed by this film. Enjoyable and thought provoking.",1504828800,2,759,4.714285714285714

6380983,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"I watched this movie on the off chance it wasn't full f fake reviews and I was pleasantly surprised! The cover art gives you the impression is a junk movie, but really how many junk movies have cover art that dupes you? The storyline is great, the whole time I knew something was off but couldn't figure out what. I don't want to go much into the storyline so here is my opinion of everything about the movie:
acting: for no heavy hitters, great acting job.
plot: well done and not OVER done.
effects: low budget but definitely not campy like the cover would have you believe.",1502668800,2,576,4.392523364485982

6380986,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Neverlake started off like it wouldn't appeal to me at all.  There's also poetry being spoken by the main character who goes by the name Jenny that made me think Neverlake was going to be some kind of pretentious and unsatisfying horror.  At least, the movie initially made me think it wouldn't be of any interest to me while firmly respecting the acting and story.  You know, one of those kind of movies.  However I was wrong.  The storyline kicks in and the movie improves in a big way.  To be honest the final 30 minutes are leaps and bounds better than the first 50 or so minutes.

When a young woman named Jenny travels to Italy to visit her father (who's a doctor and an archaeologist, but please remember he's a doctor for storyline reasons!) at first he welcomes her somewhat happily, but also in a way that feels like he demanded her to be here.  Hmmm, how odd!  She meets his housekeeper or should I say ""housekeeper"" named Olga.  Immediately Jenny and Olga hate each other.  Olga comes across rather strict and demanding like Jenny must do whatever she says and things will be just fine.  Of course Jenny being a young adult immediately dislikes anyone telling her what to do.  Olga and the father are clearly working together on something though, hence the reason she wouldn't let Jenny have the key to her father's room where he's busy with his ""archaeologist work"".

The movie doesn't have much in the way of atmosphere for the first half, even when Jenny visits an ominous looking dark lake.  She soon visits an orphanage after being approached by a blind girl at the lake (who for a moment I thought was Jenny herself in a ghostly form since the girl resembled Jenny a bit).  At this orphanage the kids are somewhat spooky.  It's weird there's no parents around and that it's dark here.  She meets an older teen around her age.  He soon reveals the magic of the lake by making ghostly figures appear on the water.  Shocked, Jenny wonders how he was able to do this.

We also learn through conversations Jenny has with her father that there was once a religious group called the Etruscans who excelled at therapeutic prophecies and that the water in the lake could cure illnesses by way of conducting rituals that involved throwing body parts of sick people into the water to see if they could be healed.  This is quite weird, and well, the Etruscans were a real Italian civilization so this story might have some truth behind it.  This would also explain the message we see at the end of the film.

For a while the father and Olga insist that Jenny take medication and they encourage her to eat.  There's also a scene where Jenny wakes up on an operating table before her father tells her to go back to sleep.  There's a reason for this scene and why her father and Olga demand so much that Jenny eat and take her medication.

SPOILERS.  From here on out I mention storyline SPOILERS for the rest of my review (except the last paragraph which has my final thoughts).

It's because the father secretly had another daughter, and Jenny finds this older girl living in another room of the mansion lying in bed and watching cartoons.  When the father walks in he explains he had to take Jenny's kidney during the operation to help her sister live.  I think he even says Jenny should be happy about this.  Yes Jenny be happy that your father took your kidney without your consent and against your will, lied to you about the surgery, lied to you about the reason he invited you over and that surprise surprise, you have a sister you didn't know about and that she's now going to live because she has your kidney.  Yes, be happy Jenny!

Anyway, sarcasm aside, Jenny's furious about this.  She tries to escape.  Turns out she needs to retrieve 6 statues that were thrown in the lake and throw them on land, which will destroy the body of Jenny's sister a little bit at a time.  The storyline goes bonkers in the next scene.  For one thing Jenny's able to escape the mansion despite her father and Olga performing another operation.  They didn't see Jenny walk by, hear her try to use the phone and exit the house?  I think Olga sees Jenny escape which is why she turns and looks at the doorway.  The father runs after Jenny.  It seems like it takes forever for Jenny to run to the lake, and it's odd despite being weak from the kidney removal she's able to gain enough speed to push ahead of her father by such a wide margin.  And when she jumps in the water, suddenly she's an amazing swimmer!  So strange.

Anyway the orphanage kids are actually the deceased children of Jenny's father.  Perhaps Olga was the mother, or at least Jenny's mother was the mother of the kids.  Not really sure how to interpret the scene at the end when Jenny finds her mother in bed and the kids stand by the bed for a moment, then disappear.  Perhaps these kids were actually kidnapped.

Anyway Neverlake is a pretty awesome movie.  It has atmosphere but it takes a while for it to arrive.  I guess some would say the movie was spooky all along but I wasn't feeling it until the end.  The storyline feels weak and confusing at first thanks to the poetry Jenny speaks of. As soon as Jenny finds her sister the story gets REALLY good.  The father is a tremendous actor too.  The segments with the father and Jenny after she finds her sister are really exciting.  Perhaps the movie should have focused more on the lake instead of the home where Jenny spends most of her time.  It would have made the movie scarier for sure.  And perhaps the orphanage kids and the older boy around Jenny's age should've had a bigger role.  Then again this would've just over complicated what is already a fine story.  Either way the movie's really good thanks to the second half.",1499472000,,5749,4.477382098171319

6380988,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"This a dark, haunting and deeply poignant storyline, beautifully acted, filmed and edited, a real classic. I was getting so tired of giving 1 star reviews to amateur drivel that didn't even deserve that. Nothing about this movie required anything but the most modest of budgets, but it had talent at every level and a wonderful script. There's no ""in your face"" horror here but what is happening is more horrific than any plastic monster could evoke, the monsters are people... as they always have been and continue to be.

If you stay with it to the end, it all comes together perfectly.  The necessary gory scenes sprinkled throughout are intimated, not endlessly & graphically shown, which I appreciate in a movie - it allows your imagination to take you there with great effect.

The poetry was an unnecessary but nice touch. Shelley was perfect for this film. Kudos to the writer.

Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't need constant bloodshed.",1456012800,,413,4.885714285714286

But I will say that the set up is solid, the premise pays off, and the conceptual continuity is exceptional. I knocked it down a star for some uneven acting and some unanswered questions (I'll put them in a comment but keep them as vague as I can to avoid unnecessary spoiling.)

The set direction and cinematography are gorgeous, and the script touches on numerous horror classics. Definitely worth your time on Prime. Also worth renting and, if you really like the classics, owning.",1451174400,,648,4.785714285714286

6381069,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"I would actually give it a 4 1/2, but that is not possible.

Most horror films fail because of horrible acting.  They become cornball after half an hour.  I find, in many cases, I skip over wide portions of such films because the plot is always the same, just with minor character building, which is so poorly done with bad actors it is more likely to bore one to tears.

The actors in this film are all excellent and all believable.  The movie would be likely rather mediocre with lesser ones.  The character building is spot on, providing you the fear, confusion, and other emotions that surround such a film.

I think the ending is a bit less than hoped, but I think most will enjoy the film overall and overlook the couple of minor grievances I had with it.

I don't want to say anything at all about the film itself so you will enjoy it from its start.  If you get a chance, it is an excellent film to watch, and as horror films go, it is not anywhere near as unnececarily gory as the worst of them, so it isn't likely to be beyond most people's tolerance level.

The other daughter also sees flashes of children who have handicaps from missing appendages or organs.... wonder where they went. eventually shes strapped down to the bed for the big surgery scene when she escapes and finds her mother who she thought was long dead. the artifact scenes I didn't mention because I felt it was too much more for an already busy movie.

6381135,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Inspired by a 4 part poem by Shelley (the 4 sections representing the seasons of the year) the film takes place in Tuscany where, after the death of her mother, a young English girl, Jenny, goes to live with her scientist/doctor/antiquarian father and his very own Mrs. Danvers (oops she is not quite that mean but a rather possessive housekeeper) called Olga. Her father is very interested in the local ancient Etruscan legends of healing that the lake near his home possesses, and has collected a fair amount of what HP Lovecraft would call eldritch art, books, statues and folklore.

Jenny hasn't been there a day before meeting some other children who seem to be occupying a neglected looking hospital nearby. Each child is injured in some way and Jenny earns their trust and love by reading to them and even getting the older and taciturn Peter ( a sort of Edward Cullen type) to respond to ""tragic love stories where people die in the end"" like Romeo and Juliet. The children one evening take her down to the lake and show her something they don't themselves understand, and ask for her help.

This reminded me a little of some of the backstories in American Horror Story, and maybe because it was set in the Italian countryside, Creepers, although I can't imagine how Dario Argento would have directed this (a lot more gore and loud music probably). It's a slow creeper, with the horror at the end. The seasons do change, with the poem, and the forest and the lake bottom are reverse images. Not giving away the ending. Not sure if the movie's title is a reference to ""Neverland."" It certainly could be.

The film is well-acted by British actors who always make everything sound so convincing, no matter how far out it is. Jenny's father is particularly creepy. The poem by Shelley is both sensual and creepy at the same time. It's well worthwhile reading the whole thing. Shelley had a dark side.",1419724800,,1904,4.677611940298507

6381139,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"This is more of a suspense film than a horror movie.

Motherless Jenny, whose English father lives in Tuscany, is called home from her boarding school in New York during the middle of term to visit her father. Once settled, she meets his pretty assistance who it appears is also his housekeeper andattempts to take on the role of surrogate mother. Though Jenny barely remembers her mother, she rebels against this in no uncertain terms.  Her father makes promises to take her on a tour of the estate, but continually breaks hisword, so Jenny explores on her own. She discovers the lake where her father had found statuettes, ostensibly thrown in by the ancient Etruscans who believed a diseased body part could be cured if the gods received an image of that part followed by a prayer. She also meets a group of  children who live in a nearby orphanage...a blind girl, an amputee, a pair of twins, and a boy her own age who is so shy he rarely enters the room when she's there but hovers near the door. The boy has a strange power over the lake and the children have power over Jenny who returns to see them again and again, reading them stories and poems from her favorite poet, Shelley...while her relationship with her father begins to crumble...

This is a rather slow-moving film but it certainly builds up the atmosphere of eerie solitude, desolate beauty, and powers from the past seeping into the present. There are fantastically haunting scenes of the lake, especially the opening shot of a single dead tree reflected into the water, and otherworldly images. Though films in Tuscany, there's very little actual countryside shown, except for the villa where Jenny lives and the so-called orphanage, and a very limited view of the village.

The films takes so long to get to the actual core of the storm though this can't be an actual complaint as it builds on more and more creepiness, mere hintings that things aren't what they seem. Then when the actual secret/danger/threat is revealed, the viewer learns he's been led the wrong way that what's going to happen isn't what he expected at all...that the usual movie cliches don't apply.

What follows is an indictment of selfish medical irresponsibility, coupled with supernatural retribution...or perhaps it's simply coincidence.

My only question when the movie ended and I believe I can say this without it being a spoiler: Why, out of all those involved, was Jenny sent away and allowed to live as long as she had before returning? The end is touching, and a surprisingly happy one, something also unusual in today's so-called horror movies.",1419724800,,2603,4.809843400447427

There's a fantasy children's book feel with genuine creepiness. It's low on gore, there's only a little blood but it's still creepy. This is more of an intriguing ""give you goose bumps"" then a ""jump out of your seat"" movie.

The lead actress, though, did well and the emotional responses rung true.  What's not believable is her blindness to what an awful father she had.  The actor did no play it with any redeeming qualities and even a daughter desperate for his attention/love would have backed off much sooner.
The movie's plot and story line was well done without the over the top gore of today's latest films of this type.  It is a solid ghost-thriller movie, and the scenes and music lent itself well to create tension and fear for the movie watcher, and an overall feeling of creepiness.

6381178,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Another great indie effort, Neverlake is more of a thriller and less of a horror movie. There are terrifying moments here, but they are more conceptual than 'jump-out-and-yell-boo' moments.
The story involves a girl who moves home to be with her father after years of being apart. But with her father always working, and nothing to do during the day, she delves into the history of the nearby lake and goes exploring the area. She discovers an old hospital still run by a skeleton crew and a few child patients. She befriends the children and soon suspects they are covering up a terrible secret about the hospital and the lake. The story builds to a climax where chilling truths are revealed that honestly made us gasp.

While the story and acting are great, there was very little need for the history and legend of the lake. The entire ""lake"" concept seemed to be tacked on last minute to give the film a bit more reason to add special effects. But the story would have been just as terrifying without it.

A great supernatural thriller that is not too mature for teens/preteens.",1416787200,,1081,4.654450261780105

One of the stars that I didn't give it, though, was for the couple of places that I felt like a scene served no purpose but to fill time or to produce ""atmosphere."" Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the setting and atmosphere both, but there were times in Neverlake that those scenes actually worked to the detriment of the story. The other star that I held on to was for some missed scenes, or even missed moments. This might well have been an editing issue or something. There were a couple of points where our heroine seems to believe things or make decisions that simply wouldn't make an sense to her unless she was knew she was in a supernatural mystery movie.

6381223,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"At first I could not decide whether I liked this.  As I watched more of it, I was drawn in.  I think this may have been intended for a teen audience, but there was a fairly good plot twist at the end.  It was fun.",1412467200,,213,3.688888888888889

6381228,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,This is a truly enjoyable horror movie.  The gore is limited....the plot twists are great.  This one is actually worth adding to your personal collection.  I will.,1412121600,,163,4.962962962962963

6381232,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"I have it four stars since it was a really good movie.  The photography was good as well as the poetic script.  To be honest it came across like a children's fairy tale, but one from the Grimm Brothers rather than Mother Goose. It had an extremely dark story line so I would not recommend it for viewing by children at all.  Adults may not really take to it either. The first half an hour before the plot started unwinding, I thought it was like a BBC children's special, but the storyline just kept getting darker so I dismissed that thought in a hurry.  It is a different kind of movie, just be prepared for the poetic fairy tale style bordering on the romantic side of Gothic horror or you'll probably hate it.",1411862400,,713,4.338345864661654
6381233,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"While I entered this with a high degree of skepticism, expecting the same old, haunted house in the country type of tale, and was expecting a predictable plot, this one was a great surprise. For one thing, the acting is quite well, the director does not rely on cheap scare scenes and chooses to focus on the plot. This film also manages to catch one by surprise with an ending that I certainly was not expecting to take place. Add to a type of washed out cinematography that goes real well with the scenes and a very good music score and you have got a really good film. Fans of haunted houses and haunted places who are looking for a real good addition to the genre without a boring and predictable end will absolutely love this. Highly recommended.",1411776000,2,751,4.449275362318841
6381234,4,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Really nice ending.  I can usually figure out the ending about halfway through, this one was a surprise.",1411689600,,104,4.777777777777778

6381238,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Very mysterious.  Suspenseful.  Full of very creepy moments.  Grabs you nearly from the beginning and doesn't let go.  As another reviewer said, the ending is actually rather oddly touching, something you generally don't get from a horror flick, especially with this one so high up on the creepiness scale.  Give it a watch, you won't be sorry you did.",1411344000,11,352,4.898305084745763

6381243,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"Well worth watching.  As others have said, this is more a mystery than a horror story, though it is also the latter, with an interesting ending.  If you like psychological thrillers with a supernatural twist and a bit of mythology thrown in, and a deft management of your expectations, then this movie is for you.",1410998400,9,313,4.672727272727273

6381247,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,"The twisted tale here unravels slowly, and for most of the movie, you'll feel like you're missing something. And you probably are, because as you start to make informed guesses, you'll realize that you're still not quite right about what's going on. This is beautifully done, keeping you guessing and really digging into emotions deeper than just fear. And when you get the whole truth, you'll be in turmoil. The acting at first seems stilted and not quite adequate, but after a few minutes, you'll realize that's just who these characters are and just the type of relationships they have. And no matter how much you figure out along the way, you'll still find a surprise in the end.",1409961600,26,683,4.7478991596638656
6381248,5,B00JLJ0AUQ,I'm a fan of supernatural/horror. I am definitely adding this ghost story to my collection. It was very well done and the atmosphere really added to the story. I admit I was surprised by a lot of what happened. I've gotten pretty good at seeing what's coming or figuring out the possible outcomes in movies. Really enjoyed it.

The build up was wonderfully sketched out by the director, but then the ending was so fast and slightly predictable.  Glad I watched it...it was not a waste of time like so many other low budget movies.  Ignore the cheesy looking cover art work...it does not do the movie justice.  Enjoy!",1520640000,,438,4.576923076923077
