Its best if alternated with an aeorobic workout. Our first copy  finally gave out after ten years, so I'm purchasing it again.",943401600,8,280,4.346153846153846
698896,5,6303675441,This is an excellent tape.  It is quick and effecient and getsresults.  I used to work out with weights at the gym but had not for afew years.  I am 41 and just had a baby and this tape is perfect for getting back into the routine. No matter what your fitness level she can recommend weights to fit your needs and it is over before you know it!  It is as good a workout as I got with my personal trainer at the gym for a lot less money!,941932800,12,436,3.811111111111111

7852407,3,6303675441,"Okay tape for those with limited time but want to squeeze a workout in, they are only 20 minute workouts",1395014400,,104,4.25
7852408,4,6303675441,"Jane Fonda leads you one on one through 2 - 20 minute strength workouts, each one focusing on different muscle groups. You can do one one day and the other the next day, or you can combine both into a solid 45 minute workout which is what I do sometimes.  All you need is a chair, assorted dumbells (Jane uses 3, 5 & 8 lbs) and a set of ankle weights.  Before starting the workouts, Jane takes a few minutes to explain the benefits of weight training and how to use each class.

Workout one starts out with a 2 minute warmup, I personally thought that the warmup should be longer but one could start their warmup earlier by marching in place while Jane is explaining things which is what I might do in the future.  Then you proceed into the exercises, you will do 3 sets of 3 or 4 exercises, then repeat each series once so you will have 2 sets of everything. Each exercise contains 12 reps, although some exercises have less. The first set includes squats, shoulder shrugs and static lunges, set two has upright rows, bent over rows, tricep kickbacks and rear deltoid raises.  The final set includes bicep curls w/rotation, front deltoid raises, and seated quadricep extensions.  Then you move on to a short ab session before Jane stretches you out.

Workout 2 is the same setup, brief warmup followed by 4 sets of exercises each set repeated once.  The first set contains standing rear leg extensions, calf raise/hamstring curl combo, and another set of rear leg extensions, this time with pulses added.  Set two focuses on shoulders, with side lateral raises and overhead presses,  The rest of the workout is done on the floor, set three focusing on legs with rear leg lifts, and inner and outer thigh lifts.  Then you will do some chest work, with pec flies, bench presses, then some brief ab work before finishing with pushups and back extensions.  Then it's time to stretch.

I like this workout, I tend to use this routine during my light or recovery weeks, it is not very difficult but it hits all the major muscle groups which is all I care about.  I would say that this workout best suits beginners and intermediates, but advanced exercisers can use it too, though some might not find it very challenging or boring.

Jane does a nice job instructing, she even jokes a little bit about how she doesn't get up in the mornings and say ""Oh boy I get to do lunges and squats!""  She also will let you know here and there what weights she is using, which can be very helpful for people just starting out.

All in all I would say this is a very good weight workout, I take off one star only for the short warmups.  Recommended.",1161475200,2,2629,4.464435146443515
7852409,5,6303675441,"I can't tell you how much doing these exercises has done for me. I have been using the video for 3 years now, and I am in fine athletic shape, not to mention looking better than I ever have in my life. This is a wonderful set of exercises and I would recommend them to anyone. I began doing them to get rid of a sore back problem. Well, I sure did get rid of that problem and several others, including my high cholesterol problem. I just can't recommend this tape highly enough.",1095292800,4,478,4.150537634408602
7852410,5,6303675441,"I bought Jane Fonda's Total Body Sculpting about a month ago. I had been going to the gym for over a year and didn't really see any results as far as getting more muscular. I thought I would give this workout at try.
I LOVE Total Body Sculpting!!! Since I am a guy, the only thing I do to make this video more difficult is use higher weights. After the first time I used this video, I was VERY sore the next couple days -- which let me konw that I was really working my muscles! Obviously during my year in the gym, I wasn't working the muscles as effectively as I do with Total Body Sculpting.
This video has two 25-minute workouts, which Jane suggests that you do on alternate days. I do both of them the same day. Both workouts start with a two-minute warmup, which I find just enough. Then Jane takes you through a series of exercises using dumbbells. The first workout starts with lunges and squats, and believe me, you WILL feel them! (If you're a guy, just use heavier weights.) She works your biceps, triceps, back, legs, [rear], pecs, and abs. Ankle weights are also used for some of the exercises, and these exercises are my favorite part of the workout. Using the ankle weights, Jane takes you through leg lifts, which are really fun. She also does seated quad extensions, which you really feel!
One surprise in this workout is the pushups! Of course, Jane does ""girl"" pushups, so, being a guy, I just do regular ""guy"" pushups.
Jane is a GREAT teacher! She's very encouraging without being the least bit annoying or phony. The ONLY thing that could have been improved upon is that during some of the exercises Jane doesn't count out loud for you.
In conclusion, I LOVE this workout. I love working out with Jane and I feel that I am getting real results -- toned, firm body and a fun workout with Jane! I'm telling everyone I know about Total Body Sculpting!",1041292800,13,1869,4.436046511627907
7852411,5,6303675441,"I love Jane Fonda & have many of her workouts.  She is the original workout queen. She is so amazing to be in the shape she is at my mother's age!!
This is a great video for beginners & good for seasoned fitness freaks who want to take it easy.  This is the first toning video I ever did while being seated in a chair.  It's broken up into two workouts.  You can do on alternate days or do both for an excellent toning workout.
As usual Jane gives wonderful advice on form & ways to change the workout to suit you.",1021766400,3,514,4.009803921568627

7852413,5,6303675441,"I absolutely loved this video. I do Billy Blanks' Advanced Tae Bo workout on Mondays and Thursdays (60 mins). On Tues., Wed., Fri. and Saturday, I do his Basic workout (30 mins) and this video (30 mins). After only six weeks there was definition to my biceps, triceps, thighs, hips, waist, calves, bust and abs. Believe me, I kept track (weekly weighins and measurements). And most importantly I lost almost 20 lbs!! I am now down to 124 lbs and extremely happy (I am 5' 3""). The best part about this video is that if it gets too easy, you don't have to change your workout, you just have to use heavier weights.",971913600,12,612,4.424778761061947
7852414,5,6303675441,"I first tried Jane Fonda's Abs, Buns, and Thighs video in 1996, then bought the entire Total Body Sculpting Series, and have been using it since.  Total Body Sculpting is my favorite, and a good place to  start-especially when you have kids that interupt you, since you can pause  it anytime.  Although you need to have a set of hand and ankle weights you  don't need a lot of equipment for this tape.  The weight workout gives a  good whole body toning--you really feel like you worked your muscles  afterward.  It also has some of the best stretching I've seen with a  workout video.  The key advantage of Jane Fonda videos is that she is very  good at instructing on proper form.  She also gives suggested weight sizes  to use, as well as what she uses.  The cues for the exercises are good  enough that I follow along with only the audio.  The only major drawback is  that the two-minute warm-up is too short.",955411200,18,913,4.463414634146342
