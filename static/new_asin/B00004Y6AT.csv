1370746,3,B00004Y6AT,"Your reaction to Allan Moyle's sloppy but earnest 1980 debut film will depend on how sentimental you are about skinny ties and Flock Of Seagulls haircuts. I file Moyle under a director's category I like to call ""Tolerable Teen Flick Hack"" (see: John Hughes, Savage Steve Holland, Gregg Araki). ""Times Square"" ain't no ""Mean Streets"", but it's just compelling enough to watch all the way through. The film squeezes in somewhere in proximity to ""Foxes"", ""The Fabulous Stains"", ""Breaking Glass"" ""Light Of Day"" and ""Smithereens"", all released within a few years of each other and all featuring angsty young female leads who usually dream of being rock stars. Robin Johnson and Trini Alvarado play two runaways who ""meet cute"" in the psychiatric ward where they are both under observation for thier rebellious behavior. Johnson is a self-proclaimed songwriter from the streets, Alvarado an upper middle class kid,  whose dad happens to be a local politician vowing to ""clean up"" Times Square, and...well you can guess the rest (and glean the basic blueprint to Moyle's later and most popular film to date, ""Empire Records"". The film's strongest suits are its well-selected era soundtrack, gritty NYC locales and an interesting, if uneven, performance from Johnson, who one suspects is essentially playing herself. Tim Curry is a hoot as a pretentious late nite FM DJ who milks publicity by adopting the pair as a media cause celebre. I strongly suspect that Curry's character served as the model for Christian Slater's pirate DJ in Moyle's subsequent ""Pump Up The Volume"". Anchor Bay's transfer is decent, and commentary from Moyle and star Johnson is entertaining and even manages to patch up some gaping plot holes (if you care).",1122508800,2,1726,5.098939929328622
1370747,2,B00004Y6AT,"Way back in 1980, the pre-release hype for ""Times Square"" told us that this flick should do for punk and new wave music what ""Saturday Night Fever"" had done for disco.

Didn't quite work out.

For while ""Times Square"" may have been the first mainstream flick to boast tunes by the likes of The Ramones, Talking Heads, The Pretenders, XTC and others, the movie never matches the edge or the energy of its own soundtrack. Not only does this film too often fall flat, it also falls prey to the the most overused teen movie cliches. Parents are ALWAYS oppressive, stodgy old fools who NEVER understand their kids. Kids are ALWAYS wise beyond their years and ALWAYS know what's best for them. Or, in short: Kids good, Grownups bad.

Of course, even sticking to such hackneyed conventions might not have been a complete deal-wrecker if the film's two female teen protagonists didn't spend most of their time onscreen engaging in such horrifying, life-threatening shenanigans. In the logic of writer/director Alan Moyle, it's okay to steal an ambulance, go on a wild joyride and nearly kill dozens of other drivers. It's no big deal to commit armed robbery - as long as you do it with your psychotic but soulful new friend. It's just fine to get a job dancing at a sleazy strip joint, even if you are only 13 years old. Most importantly, it shows great depth of character to accept the pimps and drug dealers of Times Square as your new family...while you reject your stuffed-shirt, recently widowed dad. In ""Times Square,"" such felonies and lapses of judgment are supposed to be accepted as nothing more than lively teenage rebellion.

But as harebrained as is Moyle's take on youthful rebellion, it's pure genius compared to his apparent view of teen mental illness. In this movie, after all, if you're a young woman and show signs of serious emotional problems, the WORST thing an adult can do is take you to see a doctor. Instead, your parents and teachers should just stand back while you run wild in the local porn district and hole up in an abandoned warehouse. In ""Times Square,"" psychosis and depression are merely smokescreens created by adults to squelch the artful creativity of free-spirited young women.

In an odd way, this film - which wants to be so subversive - is every bit as sanitized as the current version of the locale for which it's named. The various cutthroats and miscreants of Moyle's cinematic Times Square, after all, are perfectly harmless. They're simply the 'real people' of NYC, and we're somehow supposed to believe that a couple of 13-year-old girls would be perfectly safe wandering among them.

But even though this isn't a good movie, the DVD is by no means a complete bust. It does give a glimpse into a very different time in New York City. Just catching some of the sights and sounds of Times Square in all its sleazy glory adds interest for fans of the low-budget movies that used to play in the ratty theaters there. Likewise, the commentary track by director Moyle and star Robin Johnson provides lots of trivia and insight. And it's here, in the commentary tracks of substandard movies, that we sometimes best see into the minds and egos of filmmakers. Moyle knows this isn't a good movie, but he tries his darndest to convince us - or himself - that it has lots of good moments. And, more significantly, he seems to blame everyone but himself for the fact that the movie just didn't turn out as it was supposed to. Surely this wouldn't be the first time that a film was ruined by producers and studio honchos. But, considering some of Moyle's other work (the Christian Slater stinkeroo ""Pump Up the Volume"" comes to mind) it's hard to imagine that ""Times Square"" would have been much better even if he had held complete control over every last frame.",1114732800,4,3791,4.701807228915663
1370748,5,B00004Y6AT,"I first saw this movie when it was released theatrically back in 1980 and I loved it then.  Of course, I was just a teenage kid myself then, and just getting into the punk scene.  I went back to the theatre and saw it two more times before it disappeared.  I haven't seen the movie at all in the past 24 years, but it left such an impression on me that I have been looking for it to come out on DVD.  Now that it's available, I plan to buy it and hope it lives up to my memory of it.  Even if it doesn't, the music in the movie is worth the cost of the DVD if the complete soundtrack is available on the disc.
At the very least, the movie is a historical document of what a filmmaker in 1980 thought the late 70s punk scene was about even if he did have to tame down the sexual content that would have made the movie more authentic.",1085443200,6,832,3.899408284023669

In real life the thirteen year old could have gotten the job but would've done more than strip (see Traci Lords). The two runaways live a really depressing life.

Sadly the studio ruined this film after they fired the director and filmed more ""filler"" scene in order to fit more songs in which to sell the soundtrack. They also reedited the movie to ""tone it down"" and shorten the length. Despite its flaws, the original vision of this film still shine through. I can't help but wonder what this film would have been like if the director had free reign. I suspect a classic.

Two unbelievable social constructs become fast friends and escape from a local mental hospital. Why? The script says so. One is a depressed, misunderstood rich girl, the other a butch nut job. The rich girl gets a job in a strip joint but won't go toppless and insists on wearing dresses. She gets the job because the owner says she's ""classy"". The mental girl is really ""poetic"". You know, one of them artistic types. (...) They live in a stunning squat which apparently furnishes itself moments after they arrive.
Tim Curry ain't no great actor (as evidenced in this film), but he must have lost a bet to appear in this. What's his motivation in this film? Why does he care so damn much about these kids? Why is he so damn light in the loafers? Why all the convoluted movements?
It was an unintentional laugh riot when it first came out. Now it's just boring and dated. At it's core, Time Square is every bit as conservative as any mainstream teen film of the 50's.",1008028800,4,1149,4.58252427184466

1370755,5,B00004Y6AT,"Anchor Bay's new DVD release offers what fans of this cult classic have been long waiting for; an explanation as to how an original script, spirited scenes, and a fantastic soundtrack can add up to a disjointed and poorly assembled film.
Director Alan Moyle and star Robin Johnson offer a frank and sometimes comic commentary, filling in the gaps where story line and continuity were discarded in favor of soundtrack filler. In some instances, DVD commentaries reveal insights and secrets that can spoil the mystery of the overall movie experience. Here, the comments from Johnson and Moyle only enhance the audience's understanding of both the underlying story, and the behind-the-scenes tug of war that plagued the completion of the project.
One of the first movies ever to feature punk and New Wave music, ""Times Square"" captures the essence of post-70s New York decay, immortalizing the famous porn district that has since been transformed into a characterless mega-mall -- and for those assets alone, despite its flaws, it is worth checking out.

1370806,5,B00004Y6AT,"I saw this as a teen when it came out.  It was actually the film that cemented a romantic friendship I had with another girl, though we were not so polar opposite as the two characters.  We loved the film and I've always loved every song on the soundtrack.  Later my friend came out as a lesbian, and I've kept loving guys.  While I'm not surprised that this may have been originally a script about teenagers who have a lesbian affair, I'm probably one of the few who are glad that that part of it was elided.  In some ways the easiest thing to do is depict an affair.  It was far, far more relatable to have everything there but a sexual romance -- everything else got a chance to get highlighted. More girls have romantic friendships than actual lesbian affairs.  And yeah, I can see where the gritty docu-drama feel got waylaid into a more pop-clich plot, but again, it was more relatable for me as a kid.  Ironically, then, the producer was right, though that doesn't mean his aesthetic choices were best.  I'd love to get hold of the DVD but can't afford it.  Enjoy it for me!",1415577600,,1081,4.36

1370809,3,B00004Y6AT,"With one of the coolest opening sequences going, the film, and the soundtrack, get off to a flying start.

For me, it's the grungy, sleazy, exciting New York of the early 80s that is the main attraction; some great shots over the river, the skyline, and quite a few street scenes.

Others will get more from the central relationship between Nicky (Johnson) and Pamela (Alvarado) - I'm a bit long in the tooth for teenage angst, but the acting is always spirited, and all concerned look like they're having fun, if nothing else. Interesting to see Tim Curry in a less flamboyant role than those with which he is usually associated, although somehow he doesn't do much to create a sympathetic character. DJ characters in films often come across as too smart for their own good, so it's perhaps the fault of the script.

If you're in the right mood, this is a diverting and wholehearted film with some good use of evocative locations and now-bygone New York atmosphere.",1375142400,,966,4.704142011834319

1370811,4,B00004Y6AT,"In the early 80's, I worked at an ""ARTSY FILM"" theatre in a then, slowly dying Main Artery of the City of Annapolis. 2 weeks before the theatre was to close, I put up a giant coming attraction poster of TIMES SQAURE.(I still have the poster!) It was to be the last movie shown at that theatre. I was never so grateful that I hung through a half dozen soft-core porn flicks and over 480 showings of The Exocist because TIMES SQAURE changed my life. I saw it with friends on my days off and we were more often than not, the only people in the thetre. Weknew the dialoge by heart. The soundtrack moved us in our seats. We cheered out loud for Pammy. We shed tears for Nikki and felt her anger. And Tim Curry gave us Anticipation Shivers. We wore trash bags to the clubs for a year. We were Damn Dogs. I spent $74.99 on the VHS tape from Blockbuster - I didn't care. I still have it AND the 2 LP vinyl Soundtrack that needs to be re-released. This movie rocked my world and created a part of me that was missing back in the early 80's. A voice and some balls. It remains to this day one of my TOP 5 FILMS. I cant wait to get a copy of this NEW DVD VERSION with Audio Commentary. I get chills just thinking about it and suddenly it's not the SAME OLD SCENE in the DVD World.

The film itself is good, and I disagree w many critics that give it a bomb rating b/c it deserves much more than that. The film is extremely entertaining and the soundtrack is fantastic(wish they released the CD). This coming of age story revolves round the friendship of Alvarado and Johnson and how they runaway together and their story is spread through the streets of NY by radio DJ Curry. Many moments in this, such as them dropping TVs from roofs, as well as many of the lines in the script make a statement about society. Even though it is quite old it has a neverending and everlasting appeal to it. I'm upset that this is so expensive, even the VHS is, b/c I would like more people to see it!

1370824,5,B00004Y6AT,"just saw Times Square, on DVD recently. What a blast! It's a film centered around teen rebellion, in NYC during the end of the 70s. In that era, New York's Time Square, where the film took place, was seedy and run-down. And yet it also swirled with a crackling, decadent energy.

Two young teens are the main protagonists in the movie. There's Pammy Pearl, who's an insecure, affluent adolescent. Her dad, is a smarmy politician. He promises to 'sanitize' Times Square, to help further his own political ambitions. Pammy's father is oblivious, to his daughter's typical teenage emotional tribulations. So, he has her placed in a local hospital, for neurological tests.

Once there, Pammy meets Nikki (brilliantly played by Robin Johnson). Nikki is a wild, orphaned teen, who has had run-ins with the law. She's considered incorrigibly rebellious, by her social worker. And she's also placed in the hospital for a neurological evaluation, by her misguided social worker. Pammy and Nikki, end-up sharing the same room at the hospital.

At first, Pammy seems alarmed by Nikki, and her wacky habits (she casually eats flower petals, while Pammy looks on in bewilderment). But Pammy is secretly fascinated by Nikki, even writing poetry about Nikki in her diary. Nikki peeks at Pammy's diary one day, when Pammy's asleep. Nikki's impressed that Pammy expresses admiration for her, in her poetry.

One day Nikki decides to run away from the hospital. She urges Pammy to join her. The two flee in an ambulance that they stole from the hospital parking lot, with Nikki driving recklessly through the streets of NY. Taking up residence in an abandoned warehouse, Nikki and Pammy learn to survive on their own. And they develop a friendship so intense, that it has romantic overtones.

Meanwhile, Pammy's father is engaged in a frantic search for his daughter. He thinks that Pammy's been kidnapped by Nikki. Pammy keeps in contact with her father through cryptic poems, that she supplies to an all-night radio DJ in Times Square. Pammy has listened to this DJ on the radio regularly. Pammy considers his show to be a sort of catharsis, for her teenage angst.

The DJ (played by the eclectic Tim Curry) thinks that Pammy is a deeply talented poet. He encourages Pammy to continue communicating with him through her poetry. He's also supportive of Pammy and Nikki's quest to be free, and live life to the fullest.

Pammy and Nikki soon realize that they have to have a steady income, in order to live on their own. So, Nikki suggests that Pammy audition at a sleazy nightclub as a topless dancer, because she thinks that Pammy is 'the pretty one', in their dynamic duo. Though she's basically a shy gal, Pammy decides to go for it, and gets offered the job.

All the while, Nikki is developing her skills as a rock guitarist and singer. Nikki starts to get regular gigs, playing with local punk bands. For a while, Pammy and Nikki keep a step ahead of Pammy's father, and the law, in their pursuit of a free existence.

Nikki and Pammy's friendship also evolves, as Nikki reveals how vulnerable she really is, under her tough exterior. Pammy realizes that Nikki really needs her. And she remains loyal to Nikki throughout the film. Even when they have a serious rift in their relationship, due to the meddling all-night DJ.

Above all, Times Square is a film about the importance of peer friendship, during adolescence. It's a stage of life fraught with ups-and downs, on the road to maturity. This film shows that teen rebellion is all a part of growing-up, no matter how misunderstood it is by parents.

The performances of the two main characters, are what drive the film. Especially Robin Johnson's portrayal of Nikki. Robin infuses the character of Nikki, with a roguish, delinquent charm. And Trini Alvarez as Pammy, projects her own understated charisma.

The soundtrack is also superb. It features many prominent punk bands of that era, including Patti Smith, Roxy Music, The Talking Heads, etc. The music really keeps the film juiced with an electric, anarchic energy.

Times Square is truly a classic cult film. I'd consider it a must-see. Especially for those who are fond of the urban Punk music, and fashions, of the late-70s era.",1262044800,6,4231,4.876044568245125

Let your imagination run wild and don't expect the movie or Times Square to be like it is in the movie, or that anything like that could even partially happen.

The soundtrack is good and I own this movie and enjoy it whenever I see it.  I don't have a movie in my collection that I wouldn't watch over again.

1370829,4,B00004Y6AT,"I must confess up front to a favorable bias toward ""Times Square"". Just before its release I recall seeing the trailer and being won over by the scene in the hospital where Nikki begins eating the flowers. Since this was only about 10 seconds into the trailer it is fair to say that I immediately connected with the film. The same trailer is included with the DVD and I was happy to see that my memory of the event was accurate. After seeing the actual feature I went out and bought the double album, which I still own.

I know more about films now than I did 25 years ago and thanks to the DVD commentary (by Director Allen Moyle and Robin Johnson-who played Nikki) I now know a lot about what went into the making of ""Times Square"". Unfortunately Robin's co-star Trini Alvarado (Pammy) was not available for the commentary. Although most viewers consider Nikki the central character, Nikki really needs Pammy to play off (much like Charlize Theron needs Christina Ricci's reaction shots in ""Monster""), yet Pammy's scenes without Nikki are some of the best in the film so you can't really say one character is more important than the other.

""Times Square"" suffered the same fate that Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" did 40 years earlier. The producers took control of the final cut, re-shot some scenes, deleted others, and released a version that did not reflect the director's vision. Apparently no one has ever been able to find the deleted footage for either film. Although ""Times Square"" was butchered even more than ""Ambersons"", it seems to have been less damaged. In part that is because the originally intended version would never have approached the perfection of the original ""Amberson's"". Perhaps more importantly, ""Times Square"" has a Haskel Wexler gritty documentary style that simply transcends the narrative elements of the story. So changes to the storyline could not take away from its basic ambiance nor from its preservation of the look of 1979 Times Square-something that was even then a ghost world.

Moyle now wishes he had not left the production after a dispute over including additional songs (so they could have a double album) because his continued presence would have had some damage control value. Producer Robert Stigwood (""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Saying Alive"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" ) was determined to release yet another of his musical exploitation films designed to make a lot of money on the soundtrack. This accounts for the inclusion of the completely inappropriate ""Help Me"" (The Bee Gees), the movie actually goes out on that song although they switch to something more appropriate midway through the credits.

The commercialization of the film also included dropping all obvious hints of a lesbian relationship between the two girls. This was probably a commercial mistake because a public controversy might have actually increased attendance. Ironically, if the lesbian angle had remained Moyle would have been accused of exploitation because it is really unnecessary for the storyline. Likewise the script changes needed when Alvarado refused to dance topless saved Moyle from looking like an exploiter.

While what survives has major continuity and character development issues, the core of the story may actually work better. Two emotionally damaged girls-polar opposites- bond and help each other. It ends with Altman's cool ""Kansas City"" twist where the seemingly weaker girl becomes protective of the tough girl.

I like the way that Pamela's father finally gets it and backs away, letting her continue to help Nikki until she feels that Nikki can continue without her. You first realize how strong and together Nikki has made Pammy by the end of my favorite montage sequence. After ordering her out, Nikki trashes their room, tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide, and completely breaks down at the radio station. Inter-cut with this is a shot of Pammy standing outside her father's home. At the station Nikki is screaming ""Pammy"" over and over as they agreed to do earlier in the film in moments of total despair. The audio of these screams is extended into the morning after establishing shot of their dock building. Johnny comes into the seemingly empty room and lifts the blanket revealing a peacefully sleeping Pammy sucking her thumb-she has returned to help Nikki.

Another highlight is the scene I already mentioned of Nikki eating the flowers in their hospital room. What makes this work is its point-of-view dynamic. Moyle artfully connects us to Pammy for the first time by allowing us to see Nikki from her POV. Later he places us back into Pammy's POV as Nikki non-verbally convinces Pammy to leave the hospital with her. The hospital exit scene only works credibility-wise because the first scene set us up for it.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1124064000,33,4880,5.030940594059406
1370830,2,B00004Y6AT,"I remember getting the soundtrack to TIMES SQUARE when it came out in 1980, but I never could see the movie cause I was too young - oh well, now on DVD, I can finally watch it after all these years and...what a huge disappointment.  While the soundtrack and NYC locations are worth noting, the film itself is an amateur, flat, maudlin mess.  All the performances (save for the dependable Tim Curry) are way over the top and shrill.  And the ""songs"" that Robin Johnson ""sings"" the less said the better - ""DAMN DOG""?  ""TIME BOMB""?  And what's with that catchy chorus that goes ""N**ger, F*ggot"" etc?!  HELLO?!!  Really awful stuff.  Ironically, the COMMMENTARY for the film is actually more entertaining than the movie itself - so watch this DVD with director MOYLE and actress JOHNSON chatting the whole time, fillig in the blanks and explaining just WHY and HOW good intentions didn't add up to a great flick, but rather tedious, tired dreck.  I think this was more the fault of soundtrack-hungry producer ROBERT STIGWOOD than anyone else?",1123804800,5,1038,4.754189944134078
1370831,5,B00004Y6AT,"The negative reviews in this forum are way too serious.

This is the best teen movie I have ever seen. I saw it 15 years ago and have searched for it in vain in video stores since. Once the internet was born, searches came up with it being deleted. Now there is the DVD.

The performances of the leads are inspired. Nicky must have been the inspiration for Courtney Love!! The music (played at full volume and used as a centerpiece not as background noise) is amazing. The shots of NYC before its disneyfication are haunting.

Suspend your disbelief, and forget what Ebert and others say. This movie is a classic! See it for yourself and decide.",1123113600,33,645,4.495726495726496
