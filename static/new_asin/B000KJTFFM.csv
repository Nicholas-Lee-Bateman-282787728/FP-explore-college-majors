2691980,5,B000KJTFFM,"For fans of From Dusk Till Dawn, Zombie Strippers, Buffy, and Evil Dead. Good old-fashioned make-up effects.  No goofy CGI gore.  No stalling around. Movie starts quick and keeps going.  Can I get you something to drink?",1248480000,2,220,4.891891891891892
2691981,5,B000KJTFFM,It certainly won't ever rank as the most important or influential horror film ever made but it is a great deal fun with an excellent cast an exceptional look.  The surreal and very beautiful lighting adds a lot to the rich atmosphere.  Some scenes tend to drag a little bit but this is easy to overlook when the film itself looks as good as this does.  I was quite surprised by it.,1208908800,,381,4.263888888888889
2691982,1,B000KJTFFM,I never received this item in the mail. I ordered it in December and it still has not come and it is Feb.  yet they still debited my money. I wouldn't recommend this seller.,1202428800,,173,4.088235294117647
2691983,5,B000KJTFFM,i liked it very mutch it reminded me of from dusk to dawne,1178928000,2,58,3.5384615384615383
2691984,2,B000KJTFFM,The story begins with two College guys who just came back from Mexico with Spanish Fly which they plan to sale to their college friends. They want to see if it works so they stumble along a Strip Joint and decide to test it out their. Little do they know they just stumble into a den of Ghouls who feed on human flesh. Ken Foree and Kelly Hu character are both under cover there to find the queen of these beasts and stop them. Well soon after they arrive the Ghouls unveil themselves and the feast begins. The whole story focuses around this strip joint and goes no futher. It has ok acting and pretty good effects. It more of a humorous type horror with  a thin plot. I was expecting  a little more from this film so I gave it only two stars. It might get three if they develop the story better but it really lacks in a lot of departments. I suggest you rent this one before laying down your cash. I was kind of disapointed .,1174521600,11,927,4.144444444444445
2691985,3,B000KJTFFM,"This movie's tongue is so far in its cheek it just might come out one of its ears!  Eschewing the typical zombie/vampire flick, DEVIL'S DEN gives us some nasty ghouls who moonlight as strippers in the Devil's Den.  Don't worry that the script throws us several HUHS?, just enjoy the movie's sardonic humor, its gross effects and its campy sense of humor.  Devon Sawa, Kelly Hu and Ken Foree ham it up effectively and it's all just mindless entertaining fun.",1173398400,7,457,4.6875
2691986,4,B000KJTFFM,"...although it is somewhat of a rip off of ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" this is still a fun flick to watch. It is about a group of ghouls hiding in a strip club, and a group trying to survive them. It has Ken Foree (they guy from Dawn of the Dead, TCM:3, and Devil's Rejects), as well as the dude from Idle Hands. You just have to watch this movie, it is fun. I love the dialogue, it is the funniest I've seen in a while. This is a fun movie, the characters are not to be taken seriously, and that is what makes this movie cool. Way better than I expected, actually I expected it to be crapp, and it turned out to be pretty funny. Definetely recommend it.",1171411200,7,647,3.9846153846153847

8157328,2,B000KJTFFM,"A very poor man's ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" which I loved. Give me 100 bucks and I could do better. I guess I have to quantify this review. The dialog is an affront to my ears. The so-called perfect bodies......not happening. Performances are all very forced they seem to yell the bad dialog thinking that will make it better. They all seem to try to convey terror? didn't happen. This thing did not succeed on any level, well, the waitress was okay. A puffy Devon Sawa (so good in Idle Hands and Final Destination) seems lost here, shame, Kelly Hu whom I love is wasted here.",1431993600,,571,4.39622641509434
8157329,4,B000KJTFFM,"Despite the mockbuster premise, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The C-list cast really sells it while working with a pretty good script.",1428883200,,145,5.083333333333333
8157330,4,B000KJTFFM,"Hilariously bad rip off of From Dusk til Dawn. I can't believe that Kelly Hu owed a favor big enough that payback required being in this movie. If you're a fan of bad horror-comedy, this belongs in your collection!",1421366400,,214,4.512820512820513
8157331,5,B000KJTFFM,This movie is delightful and entertaining.  The cast worked together and rebelled over the zombie vampires and continued the crusade from that point on.,1361923200,,152,5.333333333333333
8157332,3,B000KJTFFM,"Devil's Den is pretty much just another cheesy action-horror flick, but what makes it different is the comical aspect, and of course Devon Sawa. Sawa is great in everything he's in and this is no exception. His 90's teen idol status, makes his very underrated as an actor, but honestly it's his performance makes this worth watching.",1361664000,,333,4.859649122807017
8157333,5,B000KJTFFM,This movie is your awesome B movie! I purchased it because one of my friends played a vampire/dancer in the film! This movie is awesome for a 'From Dusk til Dawn' rip and funny. If you like B movies I would definitely recommend this movie not just because my friend was in it but because it was funny.,1348963200,,301,4.206896551724138
8157334,1,B000KJTFFM,"I'll be quick and blunt the girls don't play their demon counter parts after transformation. So i decided as soon as i seen a female character become a man in drag (on top of the low bugetness of the picture) i was done. i didn't finsih it. and bite me i know low bugetness is probably improper english but ifu like movies like this why do you care? ramble ramble ...terrible movie especially if you thought well at least there will be tits...no...none that i seen, i had to take the rating on this flick down its far from a three or more star flick.",1309478400,,550,4.247619047619048
8157335,1,B000KJTFFM,"With the exception of the one-Line : ""You should have stuck to Mast**8ating "" ,and one big breasted bimbo, other than that,even the hideous (they were ugly before they became monsters) strippers with no bodies and flat butts/chest would not save the movie, Just a dusk til dawn type movie but WORST.",1289001600,2,299,4.769230769230769
8157336,4,B000KJTFFM,"I didn't have a lot of expectations going into this film so I didn't know what I was in for.  I actually watched it on cable so this is not a DVD review.

The story is about 2 college guys traveling from Mexico with Spanish Fly.  They see a sign for a strip club and decide that they should ""try out"" their ""real"" Spanish Fly tablets on some strippers.  The place is called the Devils Den and they expect to see a lot of overweight strippers but what they find surprises them, very much like in From Dusk to Dawn.

The story develops with Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, Devil's Rejects - amongst others) as an almost blind patron with bifocal glasses and a woman that is rather course (Kelly Hu)watching the ""show.""  One of the guys slips some Spanish Fly in a strippers beer and then sends it to the bar where she is sitting which she starts drinking.

She gets up on stage and gives the guy a lap dance and then asks if he'd like a more private show.  She takes him outside and they start to make out and suddenly she starts biting his neck.  Uh oh, vampires, but not quite, she's actually a ghoul and then all hell starts to break loose.

The rest of the movie has a group of 4 people fighting the ghouls and trying to find the queen of the ghouls so that they can stop the spread of the disease.  There are many numerous humorous episodes in between and the film is not meant to be taken seriously.

This has some good makeup effects and thankfully doesn't sink into too much CGI.  This is a well made horror comedy, not as well timed as From Dusk to Dawn but still fun in it's own right.  The pacing is a little strange but this film was directed by Joel Shumacher (Lost Boys) so you know it's going to be a quality film.

While this is not the greatest horror/comedy movie in the world, it is a very entertaining flick and if you like horror/comedy movies with not an overabundance of gore, this would be the flick for you.",1264723200,2,1927,4.198369565217392
