8657312,2,B00KBERZ9E,"I found this on the Art of Strength website on sale, looking for a new Kettlebell DVD.  I've used the Art of Strength DVDs for several years.  They're excellent, well done  The instructor did the exercises well (instruction and execution) however it's not 100% kettlebell exercises but improving your fitness.  If you're looking for a great beginning Kettlebell DVD, look for Art of Strength's Clinic DVD set and the others by this company (Providence, Newport, Firepower)",1437782400,2,472,5.171052631578948
8657313,2,B00KBERZ9E,"I have enjoyed Anthony Diluglio Art Of Strength Kettlebell DVDs and have a lot of respect for Anthony Diluglio.  Anthonys Art Of Strength Kettlebell DVDs are a great resource for proper KB training and how you can use KBs to improve your level of fitness.  With Valerie Pawlowskis background, she is a great go to resource for improving your performance for Kettlebell Sport as well as your overall fitness.  However, I feel the title of this DVD is misleading and would lead one to believe that this DVD was geared toward Kettlebell Sport training for fitness but this is not the case!  This DVD is on the lines of Anthony Diluglios other KB DVDs.  If you are looking for a Kettlebell Sport DVD that will improve your overall fitness and athleticism, I would recommend Steve Cotters Extreme Strength  12 Week Kettlebell Program.",1403222400,7,829,4.802816901408451
