7811489,1,6301348982,"""Peanuts"" is a wonderful cartoon series. Too bad it's off the air! This is one of the weakest Peanuts videos. In my opinion only ""Happy New Year, Charlie Brown"" is worse. It has no important message whatsoever. The boys lose in every way and those stupid girls always snap at them, and say insults. And the Wrist Wrestling Championship with Snoopy and Lucy. I won't tell who won. The boys fail in every way and it's so bad. There's nothing more to complain about.",1006300800,4,463,4.523809523809524
