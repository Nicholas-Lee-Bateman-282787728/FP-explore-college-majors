4518889,1,B0050Z3L06,"Terrible quality on the version I have.  It was obviously recorded off the TV. In some scenes, the Fox movie channel logo appears.

Maybe, Fox will release a proper version at a later date.",1349395200,10,189,4.529411764705882
4518890,4,B0050Z3L06,"This is one of my favorate old movies. Poor Lon. Everytime he turned around something was going wrong. Great cast. Nat, Walter etc. The mules, but at least the bad guy & is mother loose in the end. I just wish it came in a DVD or even a VHS. It saids in this ad that it comes on request but then it saids not for sale at this time.",1319932800,6,331,3.742857142857143
4518891,3,B0050Z3L06,"This is a fun movie about the days when Animal Power was what made things run. Interesting stuff about mules, as well. My Great Uncle Cole had a pair of matched mules that were the envy of his Ohio farm neighbors.  My dad said when they hit a rough patch while plowing They'd get down on their bellies and scrabble forward like cats. But in unison. >g<",1308009600,7,352,4.253731343283582

4518893,3,B0050Z3L06,"You'll get a fleeting glimpse of Marilyn Monroe when she was still the natural Norma Jean, before the nose job, before the haircut and peroxide. She was undiscovered and uncredited in this flick. The flick was a flop at the box office, but it gives you the one classic glimpse of Norma Jean on film.",1434758400,,299,4.454545454545454

4518897,5,B0050Z3L06,"My family watched this on TV in the 50's.  From then on my Dad would look at me with a twinkle in his eye and say, ""why aren't you in school""?  And I would answer, ""It's Saturday"".  And we would both laugh!!!  He died last year and I think he looked at me and said the same thing a few months before his death.  And of course I answered him.  Wonderful memories.",1409788800,,362,3.9583333333333335

4518899,4,B0050Z3L06,"This movie is a snapshot into life  during tough times in this country.  While not unique to that time, it is how the characters dealt with their hurdles and overcame them honestly and with honour.  The setting is different and the actors make the characters come alive.  This would be a good movie to own.",1386979200,,306,4.509090909090909
4518900,5,B0050Z3L06,I was looking for this movie for my Dad. It was the first movie he saw in a theater and he mentioned he'd like to see it again. He was very excited when I showed up with it it and has watched it several times now. I watched it also and have to say they don't make movies like that anymore.,1374710400,4,289,3.7540983606557377
4518901,1,B0050Z3L06,"For all practical purposes, this looked like a home made copy !
When you put it in the DVD player a blank menu came up with no instructions.
I finally decided to just press play at which time the video quality was so ridiculously
pour it nearly made me dizzy to try and watch it.",1374624000,5,279,4.090909090909091

8452106,5,B0050Z3L06,"Wonderful movie for family viewing. The yesteryear life on a farm with animals, farming, and hard times. The mules are beautiful and the pride one has for his family, his parents, even in the small town farming communities is so true to some lifes on a farm back in the old days.",1504224000,,279,4.384615384615385
8452107,5,B0050Z3L06,"Amazing quality!! I had the VHS which was very bad quality. This DVD has wonderful quality!! Great little movie, Natalie Wood totally steals every scene she's in, absolutely adorable!!",1504051200,,184,5.379310344827586
8452108,5,B0050Z3L06,"You would not think a story about a young man buying a pair of mules would be interesting; until you place yourself in his circumstances. The young man is in poverty; living in the countryside with hard work, 12-hours a day; 6-days a week, as a farm-hand at subsistence-wages for a harsh taskmaster being his only option in life. Not enough money to ever support a wife, and the local girls know it. He does not have a fraction of the money required to buy a team of mules. However, when an opportunity arises regarding a pair of stubborn mules, who will not obey; he is smarter than us to make things happen.

The odd title is what mule-drivers of the era would say to the mules; apparently to either get the mules to go faster or maybe to turn right or left. Filmed in Technicolor on location of a farm near a pond. The two mules are as big as horses and a pretty light brown. There is a bad guy in the film, who is very bad, and out to thwart our hero. There is beautiful girl, who is not interested in the poor young man.

Natalie Wood is a little girl in this film and has several funny lines. She is always spying on her older sister and her sister's boyfriend, who is not our hero.

Walter Brennan is good in this film too.",1496448000,,1230,4.181434599156118
