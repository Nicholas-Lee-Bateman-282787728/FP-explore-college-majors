8090520,5,B000BP8UFG,"In DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN (aka: ASSIGNMENT TERROR) the mad Doctor Odo Warnoff (Michael Rennie- THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) and  his assistant, Maleva Kerstein (Karin Dor) set out to revive the great monsters of the world. They hope to use them to conquer the planet! You see, Warnoff and Maleva are resurrected corpses, inhabited by aliens! So, after finding Drac's skeleton in a carnival sideshow, they pull out the stake in its rib-cage, and... Presto! The Count's bones acquire flesh! Next, the Wolfman (horror god Paul Naschy in his well-worn role as Waldemar Daninsky!) is located and resuscitated. This goes on, accompanied by devilish experiments, until Warnoff and company have rounded up all the biggies, including the Mummy and Frankenstein's monster (looking like a square-headed man in a bad wig)! Meanwhile, the police are investigating deaths linked to the Doctor's lugubrious plot. Can Warnoff be stopped before he enslaves us all? While this movie is certainly absurd, it's also somewhat of a blast to watch! However, don't expect some all-out creature classic. The whole ""world-domination-through-monster-attack"" scenario never really gets off the ground! Most of the ""action"" takes place in Warnoff's secret lair, w/ only the occasional death to break up boredom's reign. The idea of having so many monsters vying for screen-time, while intriguing, Is probably best left to our imaginations. The result, at least in this case, is only endurable to those w/ a lifetime of heavy exposure to such mega-schlock. Casual movie-watchers will find only pain, agony, and slow petrifaction of their brains...",1422316800,,1621,5.33203125
8090521,3,B000BP8UFG,"Pretty lousy late 60s-early 70s Euro horror/sci-fi flick, but I always liked it.  Some alien scientists occupying human bodies try to take over the Earth by resurrecting classic Universal monsters.  The monster makeup is pretty bad.  Unfortunately the Gemstone Entertainment DVD release is not great quality.  The color is almost non-existent, the picture is rather dark, and the length is only 77 minutes.  The Sinister Cinema DVD-R release is almost 10 minutes longer.  I would love to see a re-mastered DVD or DVD-R released very soon.",1378512000,,538,5.1976744186046515
8090522,3,B000BP8UFG,"When I bought this DVD, I was expecting the cheezy 70s film by director Al Adamson.  Instead I got this cheezy film from Mexico.  It's an okay film.  i didn't watch the whole thing.  I'll try to watch it again.",1265241600,,210,4.175
8090523,3,B000BP8UFG,"this is really the internationally titled version of the film called Assignment: Terror .  It is also known under the title The Man From Umo, a play on The Man From Uncle.  Please don't confuse this film with Dracula vs. Frankenstein directed by Al Adamson and starring Lon Chaney, Forrest J Ackerman and horror superstar Zandor Vorrkov.
This movie is either fantastic or gawdawful depending on how you look at it. It mixes science fiction (space aliens) with gothic horror (vampires, werewolves etc.)
This is always a hard combination to believe. (think of Plan 9) It just doesnt work. What make s matters worse is the presentation of the film here. Its a washed out, pan n scanned, squeezed in some scenes, 16 mm print.
and is also riddled with cuts and scratches as though someone took a tommy gun to the film cans.
In its original spanish theatrical form this widescreen film must have been a delight. But it has never been shown that way here in t he US .  It does have a great monster lineup, superior to Universals. But these are not the original monstres. They are immitation creations who go by phoney psudonyms. Dracula is called El Nosferatu,
the wolfman is Valdemar Daninsky from the previous years film Frankrnstein's Bloody Terror. The Mummy is not Universals Kharis, but a new kid on block called Amahn Ho Tepand Frankenstein is called the Von Faranksalan monster after his mad scientist creator who apparently modeled him on the golem of Prague.
Thats right folks these are supposed to be the ""Real Life"" versions of the fictional counterparts.
This is the movie Sam Sherman passed on and decided to distribute Frankenstein's Bloody Terror instead.
Its a shame too. Because Ol' Sammy probably would have reedited this into a better monster movie. Just cut out the references to space invasion (the aliens look like regular humans anyway and have names like ""Vornoff"") get right to the monster scenes. He could ave even added a Bob Lebarr animated sequence at the beginning explaining how the Frankenstein family is now called Faranksalan. Just like they did for ""Wolfstein""
in ""Bloody Terror"".
Ignoring th alien invaders its the usual stuff, curses, silver bullets, burgomeisters and castles. So why throw in the E.T.s? They already added the mummy, and thats one monster more than the Universal pics. Their mummy always went solo.
Basically this is (....) , but if forewarned, you will likely have a good time.",1170720000,13,2427,4.871670702179177
8090524,4,B000BP8UFG,"Well as far as Draculs vs Frankenstien's monster is does not happen , there is a good fight between The Wolf Man & The Mummy

basicly you have a pretty freaked out film with alot of cut's and missing dialog?, I seen it first on ""Creature Feature"" it's title then ""Assingment Terror"" in the early 70's and i've been trying to get it since then, I dig this flic because it has all the groovy monsters in one place at on time, and like some ppl who have talked about this movie on different site's I don't hate the Frankenstein Monster's make up but it's still cheesy

THANX

The Epic One",1138147200,2,585,4.252252252252252
