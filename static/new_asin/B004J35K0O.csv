4390098,4,B004J35K0O,The actors are on top of their game so the movie moves along smooth with a good mix of suspense and action.  I liked the central crisis of how the government can crush a single human being at will even when the person is innocent.  So what can a single individual who has always been law abiding do about it? Watch the movie and see a possible outcome.  It is worth the watch.,1299801600,2,376,4.123287671232877
4390099,5,B004J35K0O,I love this movie. It has lots of suspense. It is sad that the boy loses his mom. It's so heartbreaking to see the boy become so angry with his mom.,1299542400,2,148,3.806451612903226
4390100,4,B004J35K0O,"I was on the edge of my seat for the last half hour of this movie. This is one of those movies I had heard nothing about. Normally I won't rent with that situation because of all the junk movies.  What an entertaining surprise this was.  Without spoiling it, there are some fun twists in the movie.",1516406400,,298,4.2105263157894735

4390104,2,B004J35K0O,"Very slow moving, and not at all believable. The best acting was done by Liam Neeson, and his part was very small. There are so many ridiculous points in this film - where do I begin. Purchasing drugs on the street to find a person that makes fake ID's, robbing a drug dealer, and coming out alive? There are a million more, but if you decide to watch this stinker - see for yourself.

Acting - C
Plot - C (it could have been a good movie with better set-ups for the plot)
Overall - D (just because it was so bad)",1506211200,,513,4.029411764705882

Also, I watched it with my ex back then, and he joked/said he'd definitely not do this for me after watching the movie.

All of her appeals have failed, but John refuses to give up on his dream of a future, however irrational, which includes his young son as well as his wife. Is she really guilty and would living lives as fugitives be worth it as long as they're all together? The answer to the second part of that question for John is yes. The professor turns into a brilliant tactician and forms intricate escapes plans to free his wife. He's ready to do whatever it takes to succeed, even committing to a life of crime, and as the plot unfolds there are some nicely done unexpected little twists with just enough suspense and originality to qualify this movie for 4 stars.

There would be so many choices, all bad, and this is what this guy does.  Wow.  I loved this movie.  So many feelings, both actors held nothing back.  And I loved the ending!

This movie was so awesome from the start...great action and a wonderful performance by all with some suspense throughout the film and a great ending to tie it all up.  I highly recommend this movie if you want a good story and some edge of your seat performances, a nice cameo by Lian Neeson who first tested his tough guy persona here before he went on to film the Taken series.

Its estimated that in real life there could be hundreds and hundreds of innocent prisoners in jails across the country....some on death row.  This one follows Russel Crowe's character as he tries desperately to save his wife from one such predicament.  The lengths you will go to for love.

The movie was overall interesting. I am glad that Russell Crowe's character took a risk of his freedom and life to free his falsely-accused-of-murder wife from prison. He could had accepted that his wife would spend the rest of her life in prison for someone's homicidal crime. But, he did not and therefore he pretty much started a new life elsewhere with his wife and son.

I was surprised to see Liam Neeson and Olivia Wilde (who both played as a couple in the movie ""Third Person"" with James Franco and Mila Kunis) as well as rapper RZA in this film.",1420934400,3,716,4.5

4390294,4,B004J35K0O,"You will really have no idea what is going to happen next in this movie so beware the spoiler! Overall this is a great movie for the suspense and lead acting.

The loss of a star was for some of the terrible direction when it came to the drug dealers, cops, and other ne'er-do-wells. As usual the film director (like most other directors) had no idea how to portray these types of people. For example, drug dealers and gang members have not worn leather jackets since 1955, and ""bad guys"" haven't ridden motorcycles since 1975. To be realistic you have to rely on stereotypes and take some pointers from Christian Bale on how to play a loser-type (he is always perfect!). As far as the cops in movies they care a lot more, move a lot faster, and are a lot smarter than any cop in real life. It would make for better film making to be realistic and let the great story do the work of pulling the plot along in a convincing way.

Despite these issues, this movie will keep you mostly breathless.",1402531200,11,993,4.3621621621621625

The movie starts off slow, it takes about a half hour for Russell Crowe to decide that he will bust his wife out of prison. I personally really liked the pace to the movie, imagine taxi or cop land or more recently drive. It depicts a very realistic approach to how a man with no criminal background would go about trying to break someone out of prison. How imperfect his approach is is really what makes this movie a thriller. He makes so many mistakes along the way, that the break seem un-doable. And that's why this movie is so great. You're not sure if his wife is in fact innocent, and you don't know if the character has the guts to do what he has to, and you don't know is he has the ability to do what he has to.

a school teacher who shows extraordinary cunning, ingenuity and presence of mind
in each  phase of the tale. He makes one stupid mistake trying a ""bump"" key in the
prison before practicing in safer surroundings. Bagging the garbage with  the wall
maps and plans with misleading clues was brilliant, as was giving the two seniors
a lift to beguile the police at the toll gate. I was left  a little puzzled by the ease with
which they took possession of the white getaway car, as though it was left there , open
with the key in the ignition. My parting thought that I think many will share after seeing
this movie is .., was this a happy ending ?",1393632000,,737,4.326086956521739

I was hoping for more in the way of legal drama here, but there is almost nothing on how/why wife Lara is convicted of murder. Most of the earlier portions focus on husband John plotting ways to get her out via alternate methods. This gets interesting in places, and if you enjoy chase scenes, there are plenty of those in this film. THE NEXT THREE DAYS has its share of surprises and uses subtle details very well; however, it also has its share of missing pieces and near-misses (cars speeding through red lights and congested traffic, just barely managing to avoid numerous collisions, etc).

THE NEXT THREE DAYS is a remake of the French film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pour-Elle/dp/B002HFWBEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pour Elle</a>, and the fact that it's a remake might explain its more uneven qualities. TNTD would be oh-so-much better if we were allowed to know Lara and her motivations just a little bit better--a few quick flashbacks to her relationship with her murdered boss, her family, and the trial would have helped tremendously. I kept thinking, ""This is a generally good thriller film, but it might work better in short novel format."" I almost never listen to directors' commentaries, but the way the directors explained the ending here was very helpful and illuminating.",1368057600,,1353,5.347417840375587

*************************************************************************************************

There are very few movies where you can't guess whether things will end well. (The only movie which ever gave me a true suprise ending...""Open Water""...turned out to be factual retelling of actual, bizzare events.) You can almost always bet, before you hit play, that the ""bad guys"" will screw up, or that the main character will ""save the day"" with some extraordinary gun shooting, stunts, or physical superiority.

This is NOT one of those movies!

""The Next Three Days"" is a rare gem of excellent writing, and the icing on the cake is Russell Crowe's superb acting...never over-acted, a ""guy next door"" who could be someone you know. I am not a fan of action flicks...Hollywood prefers looks over talent, brawn over a good script. I loved this movie!

*INTRO*

The night after a dinner where Lara (Elizabeth Banks) tells her sister-in-law she hates her boss, police arrest her for the woman's murder. Her husband, John (Russell Crowe), a professor of English Literature at a community college, is left to raise their son as he spends years exhausting every appeal with the help of a lawyer friend, to no avail. After his wife attempts suicide, in the middle of an analyis of ""Don Quixote"" by his students, he realizes he has no choice...he must break her out of prison.

*MAIN REVIEW*

John tracks down a multiple prison escapee who warns him, ""Before you start, ask yourself...could you never talk to your family again? Shoot a guard? Leave your kid at a gas station? If you don't think you can do all that, don't start...you'll just get yourself or someone you love killed."" Chilling words indeed! ""You have to know how they plan to catch you."" (He points out that since 9/11, all cities have a plan to seal off the downtown in 15 minutes, to have road blocks at all toll booths and on all major and secondary roads in 30.) Anyone who has researched privacy issues or has experience with witness protection knows the truth of these words. (Have you read ""How to Dissappear"" by J. J. Luna?) You cannot tell ANYONE where you are going.

Most movies are reaffirming, a RARE FEW are cautionary tales. I could not tell, from moment to moment, how this one would end! For every step John took, I couldn't tell what he was up to. On the rare occasion I had an ""aha"" moment, I was wrong...he was doing something else.

Will John's getaway plan be good enough? What if something goes wrong? (Something always does.) What will he do? That comment about leaving your kid at a gas station prompted a sense of dread. Will this be a cautionary tale about the folly of thinking you can get away with murder? (And did she do it?) Will he lose his wife? Will his kid grow up without both of his parents now? I thought of that warning about leaving your kid at a gas station when John leaves their kid at a party...I thought I knew what he was doing, but I was wrong. I can't tell you won't guess the ending...you have a 50/50 chance of being right...but you won't KNOW anything!

This is NOT your typical ""action"" film...forget the guy who's going to shoot up the city and lead the cops on a spectacular car chase with explosions and crashes imobilizing everyone but himself. Nor is it a strictly intellectual enterprise, some ""melodrama"" that bores you to tears. Nope!

This movie is TRUE SUSPENSE, beginning, low-key, from the moment his wife is arrested, building slowly as he bumbles his attempts to raise money and takes bigger risks, reaching a fever pitch when (*** MINOR SPOILER ***) his wife will be moved in 24 hours, and he is not ready to roll. (*** End spoiler ***) Every time he looks at those numbers on his arm, and at his watch, you know the minutes are dwindling when the door will be shut on their escape. When I thought the movie was at its climax, I looked to see how much time was left. I was shocked to discover well over a half-hour was left. This is WAY better than an ""action"" film!

Just as the leads are not your typical hero and heroine, the cops are neither accidental geniuses nor bumbling idiots. With the resources of law enforcement today, you know (*** MINOR SPOILER ***) when John screws up...losing a peice of his car's bumper when his robbery almost fails (*** End spoiler ***) that they will narrow down the owners of that car in minutes, and put the peices together quickly. And, just when you think they've made it, the lead detective, flipping the coin found at John's house, watches it come up heads -- the Canadian side!

*TERRIFIC ACTING*

Russell Crowe is not your typical ""action"" star, though he's had a couple of those movies. This must be one of his best films! What I LOVED most was the relationship between John and Lara. At the start of the movie, it's quickly revealed their relationship has its problems. His wife is insecure. He doesn't take his sister-in-law hitting on him seriously. He jokes (to his son!) about the day his wife files for custody. With a few minor exceptions, Elizabeth Banks' acting is almost as good as Russell Crowe's.

It isn't clear whether their problems are serious. But during his jail visits, you learn how much she relies on him. The loving way he looks at her...how well they understand each other...how she knows he would lie to make her feel better...how he refuses to believe she murdered her boss.

When he shocks her with the prison breakout, she reacts as you would expect. In the car, when she is questioning what he's doing, you're silently urging her, ""Just TRUST him."" If she doesn't, it's all over. And then something goes majorly wrong...now what? Those who attempt suicide are weak. I won't even hint...but you need to catch your breath as badly as they.

Thus follows one of the best moments in the movie. Their communication is amazing, without words. Like John's plans, I thought I understood what wasn't said...and I was wrong!

Will they get out in time? Will he find a way to get their son after they make their own escape? Will her moments of weakness spell disaster? Will someone remember seeing the rental car careening along the highway? Will John's parents crack? Will his parents end up in prison, too?

I didn't know how things would turn out until the movie actually ended! The only thing you know is, this is a rare movie however it ends! This is the best near-three hours I've spent in a long time. (Excepting the phenomenal operetta ""Les Miserables,"" of course -- another film for your ""Must See"" list.)

Don't let anyone ruin this movie for you...avoid spoiler reviews!",1367193600,,6659,4.689802913453299

4390380,5,B004J35K0O,"Had a slow development from the beginning, which was actually ok, because it made me watch Russell Crowe's character's every thought, every move as well as keep curious enough to wonder just how he was going to pull off such an impossible feat. Crowe was amazing and very believable as John Brennan, husband, father and teacher.

Elizabeth Banks also did an outstanding job, as his wife, struggling to keep her sanity behind prison walls,with hope of ever being release growing dimmer with each day, desperately trying to keep her distant relationship with her husband and son while losing touch with herself at the same time.

 Aisha Hinds, as the detective in charge, who caught on to Crowe's character's intent, was also outstanding in his role as the one who was always one step behind, but ever so close to catching our main character. His sometimes crass and direct, no nonsense character definitely helped drive the intensity of the plot, as the movie progressed.

As the plot developed, so did my interest and curiosity to what was going to happen next. As the movie reached its climatic points, I was glued to the screen watching each frame to wondering how it was going to end. Great movie!

Kudos to the director, Paul Haggis as Writer and Director and Fred Cavaye (Writer) for the creating this amazing movie.  Smartly written and well done with a great cast.

Recommended viewing indeed!",1365206400,3,1400,4.857142857142857

A movie with a lot of internal struggle for the lead actor and they couldn't have picked a better actor to play that roll IMO.  The biggest upset in the movie is when Russel Crowe uses a tennis ball to open a car door.  Major fail on that, but the rest of the movie is entertaining and a worthy watch.",1364515200,,426,4.096385542168675

4390391,5,B004J35K0O,"And I really liked it. Director/Writer Haggis is at his best keeping the suspense taut yet believable. Character is key and Crowe and Elizabeth Banks both work their scenes to maximum effect. This is not Taken or even worse Taken 2, where  the plot line is both contrived and a flimsy excuse for the protagonist to strut his prowess. Though Liam Neeson does show up in a brief cameo to set the stage and plant a red herring or two. We saw it with another couple and while the four of us span a fairly broad range of expectations (one of whom, my wife, even enjoyed the hyberbolic Taken) it kept us all engaged.

Major problems with this movie:
-The argument in the restaurant between the wife & the sister-in-law.  Completely unrealistic.  Is that how the director actually sees women?
-Laim Neeson's 15/35 minute rule for locking down a city.  RIGHT.  And just a little note for screen-writers/directors/etc, DHS does not have any authority to direct states or municipalities to do anything.
-The wife's ""confession"" was stupid.  Was she trying to push him away to be free or punish him because she was angry at him for being ""so perfect?""  I can't remember ever getting mad at someone because they were totally supportive.  Just dumb either way.
-Who the hell would ask drug dealers where to get forged passports?  What was the point of the deaf guy's motorcycle buddy?
-Every cop is portrayed as a complete moron & jerk.
-The cops are calling the FBI in the end?  For what?  The FBI doesn't hunt down fugitives, the US Marshals do.

I like Russell Crowe. His performance in The Next Three Days was good. The supporting cast was good, too.

I didn't know until recently that The Next Three Days was a remake of the French film Pour Elle (Anything for Her). American remakes are usually not very good nor better than the original foreign movies. I have not seen the French film Pour Elle (Anything for Her).

The Next Three Days, is not a flawless film nor is its plot plausible. The strength of the film comes from the actors. The direction seems competent yet it's a generic ""by the book"" type of movie. It just doesn't stand out from other movies in the action/drama genre.",1364083200,,905,4.4397590361445785

My wife, on the other hand, got bored with it and stopped watching it. I think that there was not enough action for her. It was really more about the mental state of the people involved. Some of the actors were stilted which detracted from the movie, but I thought that was a directing flaw because these are generally good actors.

The planning that he utilized was excellent without resorting to shooting their way out. He even included his son in the planning that normally would have complicated his plan beyond believability/possibility.
A story in which the judicial system utterly failed the convicted wife ( I did not reference it as the justice system). Not only was the story sufficiently different to not be either a sequel, or one in which much of the story was copied, cut and pasted from other sources into a screen story.
The cinematography and audio met the high standards that we expect from US movies without giving it a second thought.

4390488,3,B004J35K0O,"Suspenseful, but ridiculously implausible. We're supposed to believe that a mild-mannered English teacher would suddenly become a master criminal...breaking out a prisoner (his wife) from a high security urban prison with help from 2 minutes of advice from an ex-con (I watched this film largely for Liam Neeson and he had barely more than a cameo appearance), a couple of You Tube videos and some suddenly acquired inner-street verve that enabled him to kill two snarly drug dealers and elude half of the Pittsburg police force.

I'm all for rooting for the underdog (though it makes it a lot tougher when that underdog kills two human beings whose particular crimes had nothing to do with him) but in this case, the plot was so beyond belief that it was hard to be on on the hero's cheering squad. Added to that,  you simply could not believe that his wife (who we never really get to know--hence care about) was suffering all that much in prison as they depicted no scenes of her enduring the harshness and humiliation of daily prison life. We needed to see the stark contrast of what it would be like for a young mother and working professional to go from a safe and comfortable life to suddenly facing the shock of being thrown in a decidedly non-white collar prison...and know that she would be there for the rest of her natural born days. The emotionally charged scene they did show was rather abrupt--especially because we didn't see what led up to that radical change. The wife went from patient tolerance at being unfairly incarcerated to a tough, suicidal inmate seemingly overnight...hence your prison bravado simply wasn't believable.

Including those kinds of scenes would have at least made you feel more sympathetic to the prospect of this innocent wife and mother being broken out of prison--even if the cost was higher than it should be in doing so.

Also implausible was the grandfather's (played by Brian Dennehy who did not look well in this film) complicity in the crime after discovering his son's passports. No father or grandfather would willingly let his son try the impossible feat of breaking his wife out of a maximum security prison, thereby ensuring that his son also would also go to prison or be killed during the escape attempt--leaving his grandson without either a mother or a father. (With the grandparents being clearly too old to raise him themselves.)

Continuity issues also plagued this film, not the least of which was the sudden transition of Elizabeth Bank's greasy straight prison hair to a fresh expensive looking salon wash n' wear style while they were running from the Pittsburg police force. Splashing water on one's hair from a bathroom sink would NOT have produced that look.

One final note: Jason Beghe is in this film--you gotta love him in anything. He's a Mr. Gravely-voiced, gutsy Scientology defecting one-man show. :)",1356998400,,2878,4.887295081967213

No. I will call it an effective suspense movie that doesn't go overboard with high-flying ninja kicks and cartoonish action scenes. The acting is decent for the most part but I found Elizabeth Banks a bit stiff and an overall unsympathetic character. That was possibly intentional but when you examine the opening scene, her character remarkably embodies the classic supermom persona - she's all things to everyone with some virtue, spunk and naivete thrown in for good measure. The film does well to explore some of the moral grey areas that envelop this scenario but it's topical and barely skims the surface. Russell Crowe's performance is solid but I would have loved to see more of Brian Dennehy in this film...he is a powerhouse performer but his role is very peripheral here. This film could have easily gone with a less predictable ending but we are inevitably left rooting for the main characters, in spite of the stone-faced Banks and often deadpan Crowe.

Dude should buy a lottery ticket he's so lucky.

The rest of the weak points can be smoothed over by a suspension of disbelief but to go from a jagged piece of plastic to IDing it as a piece of plastic from a Prius that is registered to Crowe's wife as the FIRST GUESS just ruins the whole thing. From that point on every step the detective takes is directly in line with Crowe's plan. He even runs around crowded downtown Pittsburgh and just happens to see Crowe and his wife in the split second they are visible in a subway tunnel.

Do not read further if you want the joy of discovering how bad this movie is on your own.

Where do I even start?  I thought this movie was going to be about conspiracy, but it's not.  Essentially, Elizabeth Bank's character is found guilty of murdering her boss.  We see a few flashbacks of the crime, but not enough to really know what happened.  Russell Crowe, the husband of Bank's character, exhausts the repeal process.  He then concludes his only option is to break his wife out of jail.  Completely reasonable and based in reality.  The movie then delves into Crowe's attempts to plan the big escape.  We see him try to  buy fake passports and shave keys.  He ditches his job and his son a lot to work on his escape plan.  We're introduced to a slew of characters who don't matter: the cops who arrested his wife, Olivia Wilde's character, and the deaf motorcyclist.

Furthermore, I never could figure out the motivation for Crowe's character.  He's willing to leave his son with a woman he barely knows so he can break his wife out of jail.  Apparently leaving his son at a birthday party is part of his great escape plan, even though he forgot to read the details on the birthday invitation.  What bothered me most was his decision to rob some  drug dealers.  Bad idea to begin with, but he ends of killing one of them.  No remorse whatsoever.  No pause to rethink his whole plan.  He just continues on his path.

I also found it implausible at the end of the movie that his wife's innocence was dependent on finding a button in a storm drain.....from three years ago.  I just highlighted some of the problems in this movie because there are soooo many.  I just felt an obligation to warn people away from this awful movie.",1347148800,8,1753,4.509554140127388

4390518,3,B004J35K0O,"There is a parameter in filmmaking that is not often talked about: to what degree is the director toying with our emotions through editing and story construction? It happens all the time, of course, but do we really want to be conscious of it? No. A story should draw us in carefully, then spring it's trap when the time is ripe.

In Paul Haggis' ""family thriller"", The Next Three Days, a remake of a 2008 French film ""Pour Elle"", Russell Crowe plays a devoted husband, loving father, and (of all things) a teacher trying to spring his wife, a convicted murderer, from prison. As with so many other action/suspense films, the driving force that sustains one's interest is ""male goaling"" -- a man overcoming unbelievable obstacles, and, in this case, totally on his own for most of the struggle.

What could be more contradictory? An ethical man, a teacher of children, a loving husband, motivated to a ""life of crime"" not for money, but out of love and an overpowering instinct to do what is right. It's certainly a premise with rich possibilities.

In the early going, however, I was irritated by some of the film's deficits. In the beginning, there is a shortage of character and location development, followed by a massive continuity jump (with the father and the son), with no explanation. Just going to black and then fading in again on a close up is not a satisfying or credible way to suggest an enormous passage of time, and it is a bit confusing. There was no trial sequence or examination of the evidence as I felt there should have been. The murder in question was not shown in any way, further shrouding the story of ""Three Days"" in mystery.

I'll grant Mr. Haggis, that trials with prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys and judges and juries eat up a lot of time and a lot of movie budget, but of course he would say ""that is NOT where this film is going."" And he's right. Nevertheless, one still has a nagging feeling that skipping over so much crucial material which could help the audience to understand, deprives the audience of a lot of linear continuity. Films do that all the time, but not so clumsily as in this case.

In short, Mr. Haggis style of scriptwriting and/or editing is too manipulative. I felt the same way about Mr. Haggis' 2004 best picture, ""Crash"". He is toying with our emotions in ways too obvious, too overt. So I have an argument to make with Mr. Haggis as to why he so selectively chooses to show some sequences and skip over others. This leaves the audience starving for some objectivity -- a difficult thing to quantify, but something you feel in your gut.

There is a general shortage of wide open spaces and time pauses to break up the action, too, which might have helped ease us into the story's rhythm.

I also think that some details of Three Days -- which, for the sake of not spoiling it for you, I won't go over in detail -- are rather improbable. Other critics have noted this. But life is improbable.

Alright, now that I've got that off my chest...if you can be patient enough to get through the first half of ""Three Days"", I promise a marvelous payoff in the second half. This is a terrific movie, despite it's editorial manipulativeness. Though I initially had my doubts, in the end this film redeems itself and leaves a powerful impact.

What can I say about Russell Crowe? The guy has an intensity, a capacity for bottled-up anger that Brando once had. Elizabeth Banks delivers a very good performance as the wife in prison, and the scenes of imprisonment are poignant and satisfyingly difficult.

The Next Three Days -- weak start, very strong finish. Highly recommended for the Crowe crowd. Enjoy it in all it's subjectivity.",1317168000,13,3690,4.628440366972477
4390519,4,B004J35K0O,"The movie starts with Elizabeth Banks' character (Russell Crowe's wife) getting arrested and charged with murdering her supervisor.  It is not clear up until the end of the movie whether she is guilty or not, but the husband has a complete and absolute trust that she is innocent.  He then makes an unlikely to succeed plan to rescue her from the prison.

Of course part of the problem is that his problems get confounded when she resists to go along with the plan.  Then there is also their child, and money problems to solve.

Another angle to this movie is the question of justice in the courtroom.  Some people have an idealistic view that the justice will be served on a gold platter in the courtroom.  This is not always the case: sometimes people get away with murder, at other times the innocent lives are destroyed.

All in all, this was a great movie with unpredictable, edge-of-the seat action.  Definitely a good movie to watch.",1311292800,,940,4.648484848484848

Condensing three years of trial and appeal into a few minutes, you still felt the anguish and frustration and hopelessness of not being able to prove the wife's innocence.  After the husband's decision was made to try a jailbreak, the desperate tactics begin.  The movie had me rooting for the success of their flight to freedom. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.",1303430400,,444,5.211267605633803
4390527,5,B004J35K0O,"Just how unconditional is unconditional love? This film tries to answer this question.

Russell Crowe delivers a sterling performance as John Brennan, and Elizabeth Banks most convincingly portrays his wife, Lara. Soon after the film begins Lara is charged with the murder of her boss, with whom she had recently quarreled. There is overwhelming, apparently unassailable, evidence of Lara's guilt. She is convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

John is deeply in love with Lara and remains convinced of her innocence after a three years' appeal process goes nowhere. So, he takes the giant (incredible) step of plotting to break Lara out of jail. He is a straight-arrow community college instructor, not the hardened felon type associated with jail breaks.

I don't want to say anything more about the plot, but the tale took some intriguing twists that certainly held my attention. As the final credits rolled, following a stirring conclusion, I remember thinking that this was an outstanding film. Then I started to reflect. Some things just did not add up. I realized that I had to deny ""common sense"" to buy into the story.

But, hey, I'll still give it five stars.",1302739200,,1173,5.0

After seeing it, the only lasting impression I had was that it was a fairly clean film that showed a rare depiction of a happy family and a healthy marital relationship.  For that alone, I would recommend it.",1302220800,,406,4.166666666666667
4390530,5,B004J35K0O,"It's a simple premise really: ""A happy family > separate happy family > (makes everyone unhappy) > try and reunite family to be happy again.""

It worked.  I very much wanted to see the family back together again.

I watched this film hoping for a good, suspenseful, well thought-out drama/thriller and was not disappointed.  I think Crowe picks projects that are top notch with good story-telling elements.

I wasn't bored (I read a review who said they were.. and I thought perhaps they might have been asleep, but not bored..) and in my opinion Crowe makes his character really come to life.  I'm not sure what it was, but his performance reminded me at moments of how he was in 'A Beautiful Mind'.  Maybe it was the mania that eventually overcame the protagonist in dire moments of decision and his ability to keep the level of intrigue heightened, I don't know.  But it was worked for me.

'The Next Three Days' wasn't totally predictable which was a relief.  He played a masculine yet sensitive even sentimental community college professor ultimately willing to do whatever it took to keep family intact.  He loves his wife and child. That always works, it worked on me.  I found his emotive range to be unexpected and rich and that made me root for him, even in questionable situations.  I don't recall the actress in the film (so sorry!) but I've seen her before and thought she also did a very good job and was well suited with Crowe.  It was a satisfying film, but then again, I am old-fashioned, I like a good story, well-told, and if there are some explosions or guns fired with other action involved, that's OK with me...

My thumbs are up on this one.  I watch plenty of films and this one has stayed more toward the top of the heap as of late.  And I'm not a professional film reviewer, just somebody who loves a good movie with story and character driven sensibilities.",1301961600,,1884,4.576119402985075
4390531,3,B004J35K0O,"I came into the movie thinking that it was going to be about one thing but it turned out to be slightly different. The previews seem to indicate that this was a movie about a man (Russel Crowe) who breaks his wife out of jail after she committed a horrible crime.  Without giving away the details of the movie to all of you potential viewers that is not exactly how it goes down. Yes Crowe helps his wife escape but it is not exactly a jail-break scenario.  I thought the movie was ok but not great. There was definitely a fair bit of action that kept me entranced and made the flight go much faster but overall the plot was dull, it was fairly predictable, and in the end you really were not sure if she did or did not do it.",1301270400,2,726,4.105633802816901
4390532,4,B004J35K0O,"This is a well done story that has our hero realistically come up with several ideas to free his wife from jail or make money to finance their escape that don't work, but is so determined that he keeps at it until he hits on ideas that do.  This makes his successes more sweet, and you can feel how close he is to missing his chance, messing up or running out of time, or getting caught by the police who get several lucky breaks and are close on his tail.  The process he goes through is interesting and builds the story, but is very much not for the younger among us who demand hot action every three minutes or else!  Liam N. and Brian D. are both excellent in small roles.  This movie is powerful if you can put yourself in the situation, and I found it smart and inspiring.",1300924800,,778,4.166666666666667
