8089387,4,B000BNI92M,"If you enjoyed 'Sideways' or got a thrill out of the intimate details shared between friends on 'Sex in the City' then you will totally enjoy this quirky amusing movie that shows it all from the guys point of view.  Guys and gals alike will share plenty of laughs throughout this flick - some of the one liners are definitely keepers (""was he a lefty?"").  The movie deftly illustrates the vulnerability we all subject ourselves to in intimate relationships, even if it's not always apparent to the outside world.  I found it somewhat of a relief and wildy funny that men can be nearly as neurotic as women when it comes to the opposite sex. It's a definite must-see if you appreciate small independent films. The award list is pretty amazing.

If the movie doesn't do it for you, the soundtrack definitely should.  It is completely incredible; Hot Club of Cowtown and Whit Smith's Hot Jazz Caravan are comprised of excellent, highly skilled musicians, performing nearly-forgotten styles and formats, the likes of which we don't see much of anymore.  Both are reminiscent of the early days of swing.  If you want a sense of it, think of Django Reinhardt and Bob Wills. Or better yet, just go buy the CD.",1138147200,3,1202,4.695238095238095
8089388,5,B000BNI92M,"If you haven't heard about this film, you are missing out. I am a guy that lives on Horror/scifi movies and british comedy. I am not the type to normally sit through a chick flick but this movie is a definite exception. I give it a 9 out of 10 rating. It has the casual humor of a comedy but the serious tone underneath that most women expect in a romantic comedy. The big difference that makes it an enjoyable movie for guys  like me is that it is told from a guys point of view. I could honestly relate to all the trials that the characters went through in their relationships and that is what made it so funnny. The movie centers on 4 improv comedy troupe members, all with different relationship styles and obvious problems. Guys, If your girl is always wanting you to watch this type of movie but you can't stand it, go rent or buy this for her, watch it with her, and I bet that you both will enjoy this movie",1137196800,,915,4.169491525423729
8089389,4,B000BNI92M,"Well written, well shot and well acted... quite an accomplishment considering it is the freshman outing for the production team.  These guys managed to pull it all together despite a low budget.  The characters are likable, funny and dysfunctional. The dialogue is witty and inventive, and it certainly rings true.  Yes, ladies, guys really DO talk that way when you're not around.  Overall, the movie is an intelligent and provactive look at relationships from mens point of view.

One quibble I have with the DVD concerns the cover design.  It looks like someone slapped it together on their home PC in about five minutes and printed it on regular white inkjet paper. The key to marketing a low-budget film is not make the dvd LOOK like it's a low budget film.  A little more pizzaz would have done wonders. But, don't let the cover art steer you away from buying or renting this movie... you will miss out on some good laughs if you do!",1133222400,,939,4.654545454545454
8089390,3,B000BNI92M,"I give this only 3 stars because it's budget showed a little (like ""Clerks""), which is a big thing with me.  But never mind.  Where this one really shines is in its understanding of men, how they talk about sex and how their hearts too can be broken.  Something a lot of ""romantic comedies"" forget -- though I wouldn't entirely call this a romantic comedy, as its hardly romantic.

If you're in the mood for a good laugh, as well as great dialogue and acting from people you've never heard of (but will), and, oh, yes, a nice soundtrack, give this one a try.",1130112000,4,558,4.336538461538462
8089391,4,B000BNI92M,"For a movie called ""Four Dead Batteries"" could you really expect so much laughter and lively emotion to come from it? Well you better. First of all, this is a film that is begging to be watched. Are you tired of the hollywood crop of romantic comedies? I am. Are you tired of most indie romantic comedies? Even more so.

How do you make one that doesn't step over every possible clich of both sides of the genre? You make one that actually makes sense of nonsense. This movie, beyond being hilarious, gives the great look at every possible angle of a failing or thriving relationship from the point of views of 4 different men, and the women that torture them... in a loving way of course. Even though this film is written and directed by a man, don't think that this is a film that blatantly bashes women and gives every favor to just the male side. This has all bases covered, and does it in a very original and hilarious way. Hilarious wordy conversation? Yes, but not like Kevin Smith. There is no Star Wars reference in this movie. Uncomfortable situations that you just want the characters to be able to leave unscathed? Yes, but don't look for Ben Stiller to set a house on fire or kill a dog by mistake. This looks at the line of familiar territory expected of it and just jumps right over it.

The characters are fleshed out, the acting is solid, and the film is treated with respect and candor that is unexpected of something filmed with the usage of DV cameras. Oh yeah, and it is hilarious, albeit in many witty and perverse ways. Yeah, it has a sick sense of humor to it, just like the creators apparently.

This movie is a testament to everything that homegrown film making should be, and rarely can ever attest to. Congrads, Hiram Martinez. You and your crew have crafted one hell of a winning film here, and my stomach hurts from laughing. You will get my doctor's bill.

Is there a flaw with this film? Yes, there is just one. It made me feel worse about relationships by showing the truth... gee thanks for the dark outlook! =)",1130025600,4,2045,4.430851063829787
8089392,4,B000BNI92M,"I saw this last year at the Woods Hole Film Festival and thought it was great.  It's nice to see small movies like this get a shot at distribution.  I haven't seen the DVD (not out when I wrote this), but the movie, if it hasn't been messed with, is very memorable.",1129593600,2,265,4.076923076923077
8089393,4,B000BNI92M,I enjoyed it!  Martinez did a nice job telling the story in all aspects.  I would like to see what his next film may be and where he will take it.,1128988800,,146,3.6774193548387095
8089394,4,B000BNI92M,"Definitely worth watching. The movie was a handful of stories all in one. A person can gather perspectives of both sides of a relationship within so many scenarios along the way. As an independent film, it was of good quality and the storyline had a solid direction. The ending was as it should have been for each story or character. Although, they could have been more of a turn at specific points [without giving them away]. There are so many lessons to learn from the film personally and within the production market. Knowing production and seeing their final product can be a great experience-to simply see and understand the making of an independent film.",1128988800,,660,4.798245614035087
8089395,4,B000BNI92M,"FOUR DEAD BATTERIES won't blow your mind with cinematic delights, but it packs a mean comic punch.  The guys in this movie talk like guys really talk (about sex, women, etc.)  Take the ""R"" rating seriously here.  Plus the DVD is really well-rounded for a microbudget movie like this.  The ""Advice Track"" is very informative and wannabe filmmakers really shouldn't miss it.

But the movie's the thing, and it's funny and clever, with good, fresh writing and a good cast (for a super indie).",1128556800,2,489,4.773809523809524
