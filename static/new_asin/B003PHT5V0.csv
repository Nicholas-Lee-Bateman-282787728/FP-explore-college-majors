8401987,1,B003PHT5V0,"This is NOT a ""3D Blu-ray"".
It is a ""Blu-ray that's in 3D"" meaning the old red/blue cardboard glasses.
(same as the DVD release of this title)

Don't understand why this isn't in the real ""3D Blu-ray"" format.
The French release is a real ""3D Blu-ray"" but, unfortunately the audio is FRENCH ONLY.
I guess us Americans are only good enough for the ""old-fashioned"" cardboard 3D glasses version.
How stupid. Needless to say, I won't be buying this.",1437523200,,444,4.6923076923076925
