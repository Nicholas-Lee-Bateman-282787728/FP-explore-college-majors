The script was writen by a five year old. The acting is horrible. The editing of the film is discusting. They keep looping footage over and again. The cinematography was pale and down right bad. If u want a good laugh rent One Down Two to Go tonight!! (LOL, this movie ...!)  HAHAHAHAHA I can't stop laughing..",998179200,3,488,4.191489361702128
540181,5,6303049184,"I can't even begin to describe the quality of the movie. If you could have only one Jim Kelly movie in your movie collection, this movie is definitely one to have. The catch phrases alone are worth the price of this movie. If you're a master of action-fu then this movie is an expert at movie-fu. The lighting, action sequences, and special effects blows ""Titanic"" out of the water! Can't wait for the DVD!",996192000,,406,4.5
540182,1,6303049184,I did not like this film it was boring and not original.  Who ever filmed it also filmed it to dark so it is hard to watch.  But you may want to watch it for your self.,955497600,2,168,3.5135135135135136

7835379,5,6303049184,This film was really great just loved to see my favorite stars all together recommend to all that like action films.,1390867200,,116,4.571428571428571
7835380,2,6303049184,"Jim Kelly's character gets beat up in the first quarter of the movie and never throws a punch or hit thereafter.  Martial arts flavor is gone since Williamson resorts to guns as does Brown.  Sad follow up to 'Three The Hard Way' which featured fair martial arts thrown in here and there, a good plot and nice eye candy.  These heavy duty brothas should have been provided a much better plot and the film sorely needed more martial arts action via Kelly. Such a waste of talent and potential!",1365552000,,491,4.49438202247191
7835381,5,6303049184,"I Love this movie. Think about it Jim Brown,Jim Kelly,Richard Roundtree and Fred the hammer Williamson four black action stars taking on the man and winning at the end. I give this movie a 5 star.",1315267200,,196,4.472222222222222
7835382,4,6303049184,"I thought this movie was a hoot from the start. The opening martial arts scenes look real and professional, but then it goes straight into classic blaxploitation and revenge movie mode: the script is corny and terrible, camera work is strange, the actors sometimes look like they are having trouble keeping a straight face, the violence is cartoonish (except for Kelly's & his opponent's work--he can't help being a pro martial artist), some of looks like it was shot in somebody's back yard and more than I want to write right now. It's not ""Coffy"", my favorite of this genre, but if you like this kind of movie, it's definitely worth watching.",1249171200,,645,4.767857142857143
7835383,1,6303049184,"You might think a movie starring four big genre stars (Fred Williamson, Jim Kelly, Richard Roundtree and Jim Brown) and written and directed by Williamson would be an entertaining one, but it's not. It's a boring snoozefest not worth wasting money on.",1218672000,,251,5.0
7835384,1,6303049184,"huuugh geeeh, this movie is really damn bad. a waist of time, a waist of everything.",1194134400,3,84,4.3125
7835385,5,6303049184,One down two to go is a great movie and to those of you that haven't saw it yet please go on amazon.com and order it. It is a great movie.,1127952000,3,138,3.4838709677419355
7835386,5,6303049184,"They don't make 'em like this no more but they should. C'mon Williamson, Kelly, Brown, and Roundtree! Make another one of these! You're not too old guys! DO IT!",1102896000,5,160,4.551724137931035
7835387,2,6303049184,"I bought this(yes) because I wanted to see what Jim Kelly and other looked like goin into the 80's.  I see...

The picture quality is very clear and clean.  The sound is what it is.  The dialuoge is hardly there.  The plot...?  The story setup was not there.  You wonder what it's all about and then once you know, you still have a hard time knowing what it is.  The worst part has to be the directing.  This was direced by Fred Williamson.  If you ever thought that there was no such thing as bad directing, look at most decent to great films, then get this.

They tried to relive some of Richard roundtree's Shaft persona, but this movie sucks.  Not as bad as other say, but bad.  I have seen worse.  I was wondering where that trailer aired.

All of thew stars must have been out of work at that time in order to think that this would work.  I wonder how much they got paid.

To the guy who said that he was an actor in the film, what part did you play?  I am curious.  What was Jim Kelly's last film?",1098748800,5,1004,4.082474226804123
