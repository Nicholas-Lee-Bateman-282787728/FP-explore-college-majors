It had me very interested - and was produced/directed well especially compared to some of the things you see on Hulu and Netflix! The actors were well versed, and true passion was placed into this creation. If you are looking for something that will interest and thrill you, look no further than here!",1486944000,,386,4.6911764705882355
8627559,5,B00GU1OWC0,It is ine if the most screwed up stories you will ever watch but just cant stop watching,1458345600,,88,3.9444444444444446
8627560,1,B00GU1OWC0,"What a wast of time! wasn't this supposed to be a thriller? Not thrilling! Boooooo!!!! I actually got board and turned it off after a while waiting for something interesting to happen, eventually I made it to the end and was so disappointed! Terrible acting! awful dialog, poorly written!",1401408000,,288,4.8979591836734695
8627561,5,B00GU1OWC0,What a wild ride of style and characters.  A classic reluctant anti-hero tale of good versus evil spun in over stylized (at times Grindhouse) imagery.  Top notch acting with characters all around.  This is what indie films should look like.,1391126400,2,240,4.95
8627562,5,B00GU1OWC0,Such an amazing movie! I watch it over and over! Can't wait for this producer to make a second movie :),1391126400,,103,3.9523809523809526
8627563,5,B00GU1OWC0,Wow..very entertaining and yet disturbing at times..I need to see it again. This indie film didn't leave me disappointed. Crazy!,1391126400,2,128,5.45
8627564,5,B00GU1OWC0,"Unbelievable!!! So many ""I can't believe they did that"" moments. Twisted, dark, and hilarious all in one. Not only is it entertaining, it's thought provoking, something that's missing from storytelling these days. Break out the saltines and bacon and watch this movie!!!",1391040000,,270,5.4523809523809526
8627565,5,B00GU1OWC0,This has the makings of a cult film. Proves to me that things are not always what they seem. Kept me guessing.,1391040000,2,110,4.045454545454546
8627566,5,B00GU1OWC0,"So first off let me say that this is one of the most original and unusual movies I have ever seen. It's dark, it's funny, it's profound, it's disturbing...so many adjectives...if John Waters had made a movie about religion in a small Texas town it would be ""An Acrid Yarn."" It goes where no movie has ever gone before in terms of some of the outrageous stuff you will see in this. The acting is entertaining, the visuals good and the whole thing is perfect for popcorn and mind altering substances with the lights out. Just nuts, I loved it because it doesn't play it safe and kudos to the writers and directors for having the stones to make it.",1391040000,3,645,4.383333333333334
