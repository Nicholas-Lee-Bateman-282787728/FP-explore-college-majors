8699109,3,B00SS2T4N6,"I've been a huge fan of Rock N Learn products when I had my eldest child 6yrs ago. I was convinced that the DVD's we purchased then were paramount in his learning growth over the years. I decided to start my younger children on the same learning path with an early introduction to these 10 subjects. Immediately, I noticed my kids were not engaged in the songs, and showed little interest in the animation of these DVD's. After going through all 10, I realized they all had the same tune/beat. It was boring to watch, even for myself. I'm sure RNL have other DVD's with better quality; sadly, this series does not quite hit the mark.",1523664000,3,633,4.4655172413793105

8699113,5,B00SS2T4N6,"Amazing DVDs. Instead of giving my daughter movies like my little pony, she watched these while in the car when doing errands. She loves them all and excited. It feels good she can learn something, have fun and develop curiosity for science and math. Great investment.",1444521600,5,268,4.8478260869565215
