2217467,1,B0007L6NWQ,"Maybe back in the day this was viewed as good by the 18-24 age range.  But, it definitely doesn't hold up over time.  It tried too hard to be groovy and hip.  Not bad for a good laugh.",1404172800,2,184,3.789473684210526
2217468,5,B0007L6NWQ,"Too bad it is the only one that starred Chris and is still not available on DVD. I bought the VHS copy on Amazon and will transfer it to DVD to complete my Jones collection. I would like TVs THE LEGEND OF JESSE JAMES he starred in. I heard it had been out and it is no longer on the market for sale. It is like THE REBEL TV series with Nick Adams. With so many TV titles for sale, they are over looking these two programs. Well, that's Hollywood!

""3 In the Attic"" is a threeway Chris has with girlfriends. I think American International produced it along with ""WILD IN THE STREETS."" Maybe someone will put it on DVD? I doubt it.",1402358400,2,629,4.1138211382113825

2217471,2,B0007L6NWQ,I wanted to watch Yvette Mimeux and she played a vulnerable college girl. So I got what I wanted but the plot was very shallow.,1391990400,2,127,4.12
2217472,5,B0007L6NWQ,"The film was not a reward wining production, but great for the time period. The subject matter was the winner.  It had a lot of room for thought. The film was made during the sexual revolution and its every man's dream. (Now days, every woman's dream.) You see this happening everyday in real life and sometimes wish it was you. We just had a group of ladies in the news a few months ago that would make for another movie with another way of getting back at their man that has eyes for one too many. You could turn it around and put a woman in the spot of the man. It happens both ways. But this movie and story just ended up with a good ending. Not every case like this does. It normally ends up in death or deep hate for the other side. It shows that in some cases something wrong can open your eyes and put you on the right path. Be careful what you wish for, you just might get more than you ask for. Great movie over all. Great cast, they did a good job with what they had to work with. A remake could be even better with the new improvements in movie making. I would have to rate ""Three in the Attic"" a classic a one of a kind. It needs to be re mastered on DVD.",1255478400,14,1168,3.970212765957447
2217473,3,B0007L6NWQ,"This movie could have been a potentially good coming of age

movie with a very capable cast. However, the VHS copy deleted a lot of the scenes which took place in the attic.(I suspect it was a copywright issue.)I felt the removal of these scenes

detracted from the essence of the movie.

Point of Information: If I could find an ""uncut"" VHS version of ""3 In the Attic"" I would purchase that copy in a heartbeat.

2217479,2,B0007L6NWQ,"This 1968 movie is a credit (or maybe a discredit) to 1968 culture and film style.  Lots of now dated slang, acting techniques and some unrealistic plot. The story is set in a college where women's rights, opportunities and freedoms are developing. A young man cheats on his beautiful girlfriend with two other equally beautiful girls during simmer vacation. The three girls band together to punish him by locking him in an attic and forcing (?) him to have non stop sex around the clock. At first he likes the situation but it isn't long until he is exhausted and dreads the arrivals. Ultimately he reconciles with his girlfriend.

If you are looking for lots of flesh this isn't the movie.",1465516800,4,691,4.702479338842975

2217482,4,B0007L6NWQ,"From my perspective, ""Three in the Attic"" is most interesting because part of it was filmed on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I spent a number of years in the 1980s. Many campus buildings remain recognizable. (I have a friend who claims to have been an extra in the film, but his part was cut out.) Otherwise, the film is an interesting exploration of changing sexual mores among college students in the late-1960s. Undoubtedly racy in 1968, it is a late-adolescent male, and possibly female, sexual fantasy that yields an unsurprisingly conservative conclusion: Monogamy really is better. Oddly enough, the presentation of college administration and administrators is probably pretty accurate with the possible exception of the late Nan Martin's Dean Nazarin--probably the film's most interesting character. (Dean Nazarin is just too competent to be a real dean.) The sexual revolution may have been in full swing in 1968, but colleges did not get the message until the middle-1970s, if then. The film's slightly disjointed narrative flow and cinematographic tricks fit the times better than they fit the movie. But it is a treat to see the actors at the start of their careers: the young John Beck (a much better actor than his years on ""Dallas"" revealed), the beautiful Yvette Mimieux, the extremely talented Judy Pace, and the unfortunately late Christopher Jones, who was on track to be a major star before unfortunate experiences soured him on film acting. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.",1462838400,2,1542,5.074803149606299

2217491,3,B0007L6NWQ,"You have to hand to American International Pictures, from the Edgar Allen Poe series to the Wild Angels period, to the free love exploitation pictures, AIP really knew how to make a cheap but interesting, fast moving film on a shoe string budget. 3 in the Attic has a special place in my heart because it was one of the drive-in films my parents went to see with the kids stuffed in the backseat because a baby sitter wasn't always available. My father kept telling me to go to sleep after the cartoons played. The adult situations went way over my 8 year old head. I saw people saying weird things to each other, taking their clothes off and hugging each other. The nude model scene in the beginning with Chris Jones being ogled by Eulice made my mother gasp in shock. Looked at as an adult, 3 in the Attic is a crude, misogynistic exploration of female revenge against being exploited by a man. The idea is ludicrous. The dialogue is trite and the direction uses jump cuts, blaring music, and tinted images to keep the pace moving. The acting by the three leads though, is mesmerizing. These young performers obviously were aware they were in drive-in movie, but a wounded Yvette Mimieux, sassy Judy Pace, deadpan Maggie Thrett and sensual, funny Chris Jones make the foolishness watchable. I hope it gets a decent DVD transfer soon.",1428537600,,1335,4.61344537815126

And Reva Rose, true to form as another one of her brilliant caricatures -- this time, a rather homely, self-righteous snoop in a house of beautiful co-eds, contributes much to the comedy.  While some of the developments in the plot of the film are somewhat implausible for the expectation of a willing suspension of disbelief on the part of an audience today (i.e. it comes across as dated and complexities too simply resolved or dismissed), the film is overall a treat to watch.",1415059200,,548,4.639175257731959

I had also seen Christopher Jones, who, during that time, was being touted as the new James Dean, in ""Wild In The Streets"" with Shelley Winters as his tripped-out Mom.  In fact, I believe it was also Richard Pryor's film debut before he gained prominence as an actor with Diana Ross in ""Lady Sings The Blues.""
