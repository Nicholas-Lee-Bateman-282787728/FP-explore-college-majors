8527349,5,B008FP980A,As a professional trumpeter I have grown up idolizing the Chicago Symphony brass section.  The performances on this DVD are no exception to the rule that the CSO brass will astonish you with their sound.  Pictures At An Exhibition is the stand-out performance in this set and is one of my favorite recordings of the piece.  Great sound quality; average picture quality.  You will not be disappointed with this set.,1390521600,6,414,4.871428571428571
8527350,5,B008FP980A,"This set is really a must-have for CSO fans.  The picture and sound quality are terrific considering they are standard definition.  A bonus to this set is that Adolph ""Bud"" Herseth, principal trumpet, is featured on several pieces.  Bud played principal trumpet in that great CSO brass section for well over 50 years and there are some great shots of him playing.  One of his trade marks of turning beet red while playing is well documented here.  Mr. Herseth passed away earlier this year (2013) making this set of DVDs really special.  His playing will be missed but his legacy as a player lives on through recorded media like this DVD set.",1369526400,8,642,4.6875
8527351,5,B008FP980A,"Solti is at his most dynamic in this set of performances from Japan.  For ""Pictures At an Exhibition"" there is a most
charming extra with Sir Georg rehearsing the players.  These performances were produced toward the end of his
life and it is wonderful to see some of the long-time players still with him, some now with gray hair, etc.  That BRASS
section?  A miracle of sonic beauty.  Unfortunately, Sony did not see fit to include ANY liner notes or other ""extras"".
Also, there are no sound format choices, something I find very helpful.
As a rabid fan of Solti, I could watch this man eat a bowl of soup and be thrilled.  Granted, some people object to his
flamboyant way of conducting, but I prefer his methods to the dry and boring fuddy-duddies out there.",1359504000,17,761,4.5588235294117645
8527352,5,B008FP980A,This collection captures the magic of the Solti/Chicago partnership in its prime. The purchase of this set will not disapoint. As a bonus on the Mussorgsky disc you have Solti discussing the work as well as his personal insights and musical decisions in conducting this work.,1358035200,9,275,5.0
8527353,5,B008FP980A,"While familiar with the Mussorgsky, Mozart, and Mahler, which I've loved, I was delighted by the new Beethoven selections included here. They are excellent.",1355011200,9,156,5.541666666666667
