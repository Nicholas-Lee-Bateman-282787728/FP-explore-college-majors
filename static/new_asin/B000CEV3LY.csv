2462649,5,B000CEV3LY,"Man in the Moon  is the story of the first love of a young teenage girl that begins that begins comic, but turns tragic when when the boy suddenly dies.  It is a growing up story set in the south, circa late 1950's. There is tension between the two sisters when it becomes evident that the boy prefers the older teenage sister.  Thid movie is a work of art starring a young Reese Witherspoon who gives a fantastic performance as the young teenage girl, taking the viewer through the many emotions she experiences as the movie progressess.  It is a movie the viewer will want to watch more than once.",1257120000,3,599,4.418181818181818
2462650,5,B000CEV3LY,"Here I got a 2 for one deal. My favorite!! I liked man in the moon, it is a good drama. You need a box of kleenex though. i found it to be a tear jerker at some point. Now Benny and Joon. I don't know how anyone can not fall in love with Johnny Depp. Yes, he was great in Pirate's of the Caribbean. He plays a slightly different character in this film, he is a bit autistic one might say? He plays his character to the fullest. He is charming, witty, just so adorable. It's a classic but it will never be too old for any genre. This movie is like a breath of fresh air! Don't take my word for it, do a search for Benny and Joon movie trailer, watch the preview and then you just might see where I'm coming from. (my fav. part is him doing hat tricks)",1227916800,6,750,3.8766233766233764
2462651,5,B000CEV3LY,"Though I am generally not a fan of these pre-packaged double features because you often end up with one film you want and one you are just ho-hum about, this one has two really enjoyable films which, while quite different, are very appealing.

Benny and Joon has sort of taken on cult status as a quirky romantic comedy since its original release. Johnny Depp gives a charismatic performance as the very off-beat Sam, who watches Benny's (AIdan Quinn) sister, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) while he works. The focus is on the romance that develops between Sam and Joon, but Aidan Quinn is excellent also as a brother so worried about his mentally challenged sister's future he almost harpoons his own chance at happiness with a young and lovely Julianne Moore.

The grill cheese scene, the hat in the park, and the poignant bus scene offer both romance and just enough depth to make this film live whereas others in the genre simply fall flat. Masterson is just as memorable as Depp in her own way and the secondary romance offers something of interest as well. A great date movie.

As good as ""Benny and Joon"" is, however, the real prize here might just be ""Man in the Moon.""  A poignant coming of age story set in rural Louisiana during the 1950's, it is beautifully photographed and filled with love and tenderness. The focal point of director Robert Mulligan's fine film is a very young Reese Witherspoon and she truly sparkles.

Sam Waterson is the kind and gentle husband and father whose two daughters are growing up faster than he can blink while one more is on the way. Tess Harper has another fine turn as his loving wife Abigail. There is a very human and peaceful feel to this film that works its way into your heart slowly and remains there long after the closing credits.

Dani (Reese Witherspoon) is the spunky but tender-hearted 14 year old younger sister who is beginning to cross the waters from child to young womanhood. Her adolescent crush on Elvis Presley changes to something real when 17 year old Court Foster (Jason London) enters the picture. They both like to swim in the lake and become something more than friends but something less than a couple. Their relationship is handled in a sweet and thoughtful manner by Mulligan, who also helmed ""Summer of '42.""

But as much as Court cares about her when chance brings he and her older sister Maureen (Emily Wakefield) together nature takes its course and someone's heart is bound to break. Dani secretly worships Maureen and wants to be like her and Maureen loves Dani just as much but can't pass up the love of her life no matter how hard she might try.

Court is also portrayed as a very decent kid with the weight of the world on his shoulders who is trying to do the right thing and still be happy. Everthing about this feels real, as there are no good guys and bad guys, just a truthful portrait of young love and growing up. Witherspoon is amazing and you can truly feel her heart breaking as she begins to disappear, only her memories of the lake and her first kiss to comfort her.

It will take even more than a tragedy to bring Dani and Maureen back together and it is the wise and gentle father who takes Dani fishing and talks to her in a way every father hopes he will talk to his daughter under similar circumstances. A quiet and wonderful film handled with great sensitivity, it is quite memorable. Put together with ""Benny and Joon"" it is hard to pass up, and hopefully will be more widely seen. A real bargain.",1210291200,11,3500,4.560509554140127

2462702,5,B000CEV3LY,"""Benny and Joon"", though still a good film, is not as good as I remembered it.  I think when I saw it on it's initial release I was wowed by Johnny Depp but on second viewing it's not all that impressive.  Depp is good when he channels the old-time movie comedians but as a full-bodied character his Sam is sadly underdeveloped.  What also hurts the film is you don't feel much chemistry between he and the mentally-disabled Joon assayed by Mary Stuart Masterson, normally a good actress but seems a little affected here.  The film's saving grace is the performances of Aidan Quinn as the self-sacrificing Benny and Julianne Moore as Ruthie, the kindly waitress.  Whereas the relationship between Sam and Joon seems a little precious you feel a little kineticism between Benny and Rosie.  ""Benny and Joon"" is an interesting film that falls short of it's noble intentions.  ""The Man in the Moon"", on the other hand, succeeds on every level.  This heartwarming account of growing up and falling in love in late Fifties Louisiana is both touching and poignant.  Though it is a film about growing up it makes very wise observations about pain and heartbreak.  This film feels very real, true, and honest.  Anchored by a star-making performance by a debuting Reese Witherspoon, whose work here anticipates her great performances to come, this film also contains equally fine performances her young co-stars, Emily Warfield and Jason London.  Not to be overlooked are the contributions of the adults played By Sam Waterson, Tess Harper, and Gail Strickland.  Though the focus is on the kids these oldsters are no carbon copy authority figures.  Though flawed as we all are they offer the children comfort and sage advise by word and example.  What impressed me most is that despite some elements that some could call melodramatic director Robert Mulligan tempers such moments and grounds them in reality.  As a stand alone ""Benny and Joon"" would merit four stars but pared with the superlative ""The Man in the Moon"" I give this set the full five star treatment.",1304035200,2,2055,4.878962536023055

8098705,5,B000CEV3LY,"A young Johnny Depp in ""Benny and Joon"" and an even younger Reese Witherspoon both show the promise of future stardom.  I hadn't heard of either film before I saw them, both involve gentle romantic scenes, both have dark sides to highlight the bright sides.  I'd be willing to buy either one individually now that I've seen them.  And more willing to buy more titles involving either of these actors.",1448064000,,400,4.685714285714286
