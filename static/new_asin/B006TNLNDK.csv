5016358,1,B006TNLNDK,You've got to be kidding. A star?This deserves black hole status. Not even the production lighting could escape from this abysmal offering. Next time have your family reunion off set.,1396742400,,183,5.133333333333334
5016359,1,B006TNLNDK,"'Cause apparently, that's what they're doing.  Which is cool and all, but some warning would be nice.

Main character, the assassin, looks like a tween.  This does not for an action movie realism make.  It does make it hilarious, but unintentionally.

It's not bad enough to be awesome.  It's just bad enough to be really, really bad.

This is my second attempt at trying to watch this movie.  The first time I watched about 3/4 of it.  Couldn't even make it this far this time.

Amazon should have paid me to watch the parts I did.",1396483200,7,532,4.447916666666667
5016360,1,B006TNLNDK,"I was just minding my own business, surfing Amazon for some free instant videos to stream. Found this one, hooked by its cover and was utterly disappointed by the first minute of this film. I'm surprised I even watched on after the first 30 seconds of cheap footage with film grain which I almost took for a noire-style flashback sequence. Immediately, after the amateurish camera shake kicked in, I knew I was in for the unbearable.

The fighting sequences are just abhorrent. The backgrounds are completely mismatched and the clips are just not smoothly pieced together. This should've been a Youtube project at best. That said, it would've fared better there, anyhow for free.",1388361600,3,679,4.956140350877193
5016361,1,B006TNLNDK,"It doesn't get much cheaper than this!  Even FREE was too much to pay for this low-level traif. I am so glad I didn't spend any money on this. I watched the opening bit, about 10 seconds worth, and could see it was shot on poor equipment with poor lighting, annoying 60 cycle screen flip, and high-school drop-out type script. Real Pukesville!  Sorry!",1385856000,4,351,4.555555555555555
5016362,2,B006TNLNDK,"Movie was slow, story was ok. The main character was interesting, but his decisions weren't believable. Needed other characters to make the whole thing work.",1381449600,,157,5.32
5016363,2,B006TNLNDK,"Running out of things to watch.. this is b- good story line , less than good acting. Hey free is a good price and not a total waste.",1360108800,,132,3.75
5016364,1,B006TNLNDK,"I noticed that I really have to be careful with foreign films, this one I would say is a ""D"", at least I was able to trade it in and get something back for it.",1339804800,,159,3.5714285714285716
5016365,1,B006TNLNDK,"It isn't really a movie. Rather, it appears to be friends/family/schoolmates that got together to do a film while learning how to use the equipment. I sort of expected something like that - but really, it is even worse than you expect. Don't rent this and encourage more people to put similar kinds of junk up.",1337990400,,310,4.553571428571429
5016366,1,B006TNLNDK,"Unintelligible script, horrible acting, no plot, bad stunts, amateurish camera work. I was given a case of these, and after viewing the disc, I couldn't list them in good conscience, so I tossed them in the dumpster..... the dumpster threw up. Deserving of a zero star rating.",1449964800,,276,4.8936170212765955
5016367,3,B006TNLNDK,Didn't really watch it.  I fell asleep before the movie started.,1446768000,,64,4.818181818181818
5016368,1,B006TNLNDK,The photography was bad. The acting was bad. The direction was awful. There was no story. The editing could have been worse but I am not sure how. The movie does have a good title.,1441756800,,180,4.171428571428572
5016369,1,B006TNLNDK,Bad,1439856000,,3,3.0
5016370,1,B006TNLNDK,"Come on people... you pretty much knew what you were in for when you saw that it was directed by AND starred the same unknown loser... I mean who da fuq is Kemal Yildrim? Maybe the next Tom Cruise or Clint Eastwood? nah...it was just some high school kid with an old school camcorder he found in his grandpa's locker.... and the camera wasn't even working correctly obviously... he probably should have taken it down to the local video repair shop first. Wait... do they still have those things around? lmao... anyway, it was nice seeing this kid's geek squad production for his drama class...in high school. Maybe he should try stepping up to Youtube next? The world is your oyster Kemal...the whole damn world ;-)",1439337600,,715,4.682539682539683

5016373,2,B006TNLNDK,The ending makes no sense unless the lead actor died or was fired and they raped up the film with what ever they could come up with just to finish the film. The movie is entertaining but not very good.,1428624000,,201,4.05
5016374,2,B006TNLNDK,Could never get into this movie. Watched some but cut it off after a while. Can not recommend.,1404864000,,94,4.277777777777778
