1058368,4,6305669430,"This is a thorough look at Gaudi's work in Barcelona, with hauntingly beautiful music as it's backdrop (very little dialogue). It has some interesting extras but does not include an early film of Gaudi's work (by Ira Latour) which would have made it a definitive compilation of Gaudi films.",1206662400,6,290,4.938775510204081
1058369,5,6305669430,"This 1984 documentary about the architect essentially lets Gaudi's work speak for itself, and it couldn't be more eloquent. The cinematography by Junichi Segawa, Yoshikazu Yanagida, and Ryu Segawa provides perspectives you couldn't get on-site in Barcelona, guiding you at a perfect pace through intimate interiors or whisking you to aerial vantage points, alternating between minute details and comprehensive views. The often gently moving camera and the lyrical editing unobtrusively yet decisively shape what you see. The acutely perceptive sound track doesn't have to compete with continual voice-over--much of the historical information is provided in on-screen titles that barely disrupt the enveloping beauty of the images.

Unfortunately, this amazing film is out of print. I haven't been able to find any copies of the DVD edition anywhere on the web or by calling distributors - I believe the 2 or 3 copies of the VHS edition for sale here on Amazon are the only copies of this movie for sale on the web. Get them while you still can - according to Image Entertainment, there are no plans to reissue this film.",1163721600,,1120,5.153846153846154
1058370,4,6305669430,"For those used to the more linear approach to documentaries seen in American and European docs, this 1984 film will come as either a revelation or a bore (see one of the below reviews). But the director, Hiroshi Teshigahara--who had previously made several films with the composer Toru Takemitsu (all based on the writing of Kobo Abe)--here takes an unusual approach to the documentary, almost completely eschewing voiceover or any linear narrative perspective to instead immerse the viewer in the brilliance that was Antonio Gaudi.

Some people know Gaudi was the architect who designed and built highly original cathedrals (principally the Sagrada Familia) and other buildings in Barcelona. But what they may not know is that he was also a ceramics artist and a sculptor. Teshigahara lovingly and meticulously guides and glides us through the surreal archiect's work, comprising not only the aforementioned structures, but also buttresses, apartment building exteriors and interiors both, gates, ceilings, and all manner of unusual and strikingly organic shapes--a group of stone columns uncannily resembles a clump of trees--that amaze the viewer.

All the while, Takemitsu's music provides a unique complement to these startling visual images, often juxtaposing stark experimental sequences with their opposite--rigidly formal church music. The contrast of the two is an intriguing mix and a perfect match to what we are seeing. Gaudi was strongly religious, yat at the same time boldly innovative in his designs. Nowhere else on earth will anyone ever see buildings and structures like they will in Barcelona.

Near the end of the film, a Japanese narrator translates Spanish into Japanese--the Spanish is that of a student of Gaudi's; meanwhile, English subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen. The student speaks of his teacher, and that is the only ""text"" we are privy to in learning something about him. But it is very short, and soon after, the film ends. Teshigahara means, of course, for Gaudi's work to speak for itself, but he is also, I think, saying that there is something more to these breathtaking forms than just the sensuous pleasure of seeing them. There is, we could likely say, a mystical sense of what Gaudi was trying to do...

Highly recommended. Nothing else like this documentary anywhere. Unfortunately as of this writing, February 2006, the DVD is out of print.",1140912000,11,2397,5.218181818181818
1058371,4,6305669430,"When I first saw this film, I did not know what to expect. One thing is there is no dialogue, just footage of the glorious city of Barcelona and the effect Gaudi's work had on the place. It's beautiful, surreal and an extremely awe inspiring experience to view it all on film. There is a depth to this film which words cannot convey, only seeing this film can one appreciate Gaudi and the city of Barcelona. A city imbued with enormous beauty and creative genius. One can feel great pride for the Catalan people by just his (Gaudi's) example alone. Well worth your time to see!",1036972800,19,577,4.452830188679245

Having visited Barcelona/Sagrada Familia, Park Guell in May 2001, I was extremely interested in seeing (again) the magnificent works of Gaudi, and hearing the intoxicating Catalan language.  Thankfully this DVD provided striking images of the magnificent buildings, but what I missed was any sort of background on the man, his inspirations, schooling, etc.  While I may be regulated to perusing books and other assorted publications to find out more about Gaudi, this video will provide stunning visuals.

1058462,4,6305669430,"Going into this film, I really had no idea who was Antonio Gaudi nor was I deeply familiar with his works.  I knew the film was about architecture and had very little dialogue.  I wanted to approach the film without knowing much about the artist.  In this approach, I felt it would release my expectations.  This gave me quite a journey!  I am sure other films of similar structure have been made, but probably not about such an interesting individual.

This film looks at the famous architectural works of Antonio Gaudi, a Spaniard who lived in the early 20th century.  His architectural works are incredibly striking, and it may be safe to say that no other architect is quite like him!  That being said, the film examines his works as though someone is wondering patiently through the streets of Barcelona.  Because of the paucity of the dialogue, the film deploys odd ambiance and electronic music to somehow express Gaudi's works.  The result is a very unique and fascinating experience.

The viewer will fall into a state of awed hypnosis as the camera eye moves in a snail's pace looking at Gaudi's works.  Since Gaudi's works are so different from anything else, it has the feeling of something other worldly.  Once in a while, the music stops, and we are shown pictures of everyday, mundane life in Spain.  But then, the music reappears again as we walk through Gaudi's architecture, as though we are being transported into another world the exists right alongside the modern-day life of Barcelona.

At the end of the film, we are told more about Gaudi's life.  I still don't know much about him, but now seeing this film, I am eager to learn more.  Try to approach this film like I did; with innocent eyes, even if you know a lot of Gaudi.  Without the use of very little words, and with the use of grotesque music, the movie is a great introduction into the mind of someone who might have been a genius.  4 1/2 stars out of 5.",1412121600,,1937,4.578488372093023
1058463,3,6305669430,"The photography of Gaudi' s creativity set to music is intriguing, but erratic. If you are unfamiliar with Barcelona's  architectural landmarks, you may not know exactly which sites you are viewing in such detail. Very few words are spoken and those that are provide little or no enlightenment. If you a Gaudi fan or knowledgeable about Barcelona's architecture, you will derive more pleasure from this video.",1391385600,,409,5.196969696969697
1058464,4,6305669430,"Antonio Gaud&iacute; (Hiroshi Teshigahara, 1985)

I only know who Antonio Gaud&iacute; is thanks to a mix-up at my local library. I can no longer remember what I was supposed to be picking up, but it was not a book about modern architecture. That said, when the library hands me something, even as a mistake, I usually read it, and so I ended up finding out some things about the architect. Put him together with the guy who directed Face of Another and I'm game. Of course, this being Teshigahara, Antonio Gaud&iacute; is in no way your typical documentary, and that is much to the film's credit. In fact (spoiler alert!), by the time I was done watching it, it had become my favorite Teshigahara film.

There is a minimum of the stuff one expects to find in a documentary. Instead, Teshigahara focuses on Gaud&iacute;'s designs, giving us beautiful shots of buildings, sweeping panoramas followed by minuscule close-ups, focusing not only on the big, flashy buildings, but taking us to a park, a garden, a crypt, you name it. There's a real sense of breadth here, and Teshigahara captures it beautifully.

I'm not entirely sure what else to say about the movie, as is evidenced (not like you could know this, but still) by the fact that I have scheduled this review to be posted on January 7, 2014, and I am still sitting here looking for a closing paragraph on the night of January 5. Everything I come up with to stick here is just a retread of what I said in the first two paragraphs, mostly about how ridiculously beautiful the thing is and how well it was shot. So I will just give up trying and tell you that if you don't have a Hulu Plus subscription to be able to access the Criterion Collection on demand, this movie alone would be worth the subscription fee. Having access to so much of the rest of the collection is just icing on the cake. ****",1389052800,,1857,4.520833333333333

Too be honest I wasn't impressed.  Then suddenly, the camera fixes on what seems like both the largest and strangest cathedral ever built.  It's clear the man who designed this understood every variety of European architecture, yet managed to take it in an entirely new direction.

1058469,3,6305669430,"Sometimes, when watching DVDs to review, the odd occurrence of extra features surpassing the featured film occurs. Such is the case with The Criterion Collection's DVD of Japanese filmmaker Hiroshi Teshigahara's titular 1984 documentary on the buildings of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926)- the film's title is a spelling error. The film runs a mere 72 minutes, yet it seems much longer, and this is because, despite the film's title, there is a surprisingly small focus on the actual works of the architect. Much of the film skirts over things related to the buildings, and adds in odd musical accompaniment, by Toru Takemitsu, Kurodo Mori, and Shinji Hori.

  Aside from a few spoken words, caught seemingly on the fly, there is no narration in this `documentary,' which may make it superficially seem to be even more documentary than most documentaries. Yet, it lacks the power of similar films made by Werner Herzog, or the -Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio because the images and the music rarely cohere. And, even when the film is showing a Gaudi work it never lingers on it in full for long, as the cinematography, by Junichi Segawa, Yoshikazu Yanagida, and Ryu Segawa, merely skims, and often shows people in the buildings, or around then, thus detracting from the `purity' of the work. There's little doubt that Gaudi was an excellent practitioner of his craft, which often seems to prefigure the drawings of H.R. Giger in their sensual animalism. They also recall the sets used in the original 1968 The Planet Of The Apes. But one will not be able to delve into the extent of that talent via this main film, for there is no absorption into the imagery of the art. And this is quite surprising, since Teshigahara's earlier films, like Pitfall, Woman In The Dunes, and The Face Of Another, were so in synch with their subject matter. One can only guess that the gap between drama and documentary filmmaking is a divide the man, for whatever reasons, simply could not bridge. For some, the film may be a great experience, but it is not great art.",1339027200,,2061,4.81638418079096

1058512,5,6305669430,This is an amazingly beautiful and comprehensive book for a very reasonable price! It contains photographs and descriptions of all of Gaudi's works.,1328054400,,148,5.478260869565218
1058513,5,6305669430,"Two different perspectives; a same goal: two filmmakers from different latitudes. From France, George Clouzot  (Mystery Picasso) -1956- and from Japan, Hiroshi Teshigara in 1959; both of them felt the imperious necessity to pay tribute around two great Spanish artists (Picasso and Gaudi) and both were sumptuous masterworks by themselves.

Hiroshi Teshigahara (Woman in Dunes) constructed a real Patrician portrait of Catalan Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926) one of the major driving forces of the Architecture around the world. Through a vibrant and enthralling cinematic experience, this marvellous visual poem invites us to dive ourselves inside  his astonishing buildings, parks and interiors. Depicting the curves of his structures from the singles works, his home, Gueil Park, the house gaudi designed on Wagner's memory (You can see it too in Antonioni's film The Passenger) until his monumental still-unfinished masterpiece the Sagrada Familia.

1058516,4,6305669430,"If you are a fan of art, or architecture, or both, this film deserves a look. Yes, as many other reviewers have noted it is made with a sensibility that 21st century US viewers may find trying, but on the other hand the minimalism works to emphasize Gaudi's forms as there aren't quick cuts, busy music, or distracting narration. The viewer instead gets to visually explore the spaces at leisure, much like looking at a painting in a gallery.

And what explorations! The genius of Gaudi is quickly revealed-a perfect balance of form and function, structures and spaces that are both architecture and art. And further than that, Gaudi's work is shown to be fractal, an amazing amount of detail at different levels of magnification. La Sagrada Familia is the most obvious example with the elaborate statuary embedded into the Nativity facade, but the viewer sees many more examples of this genius prior to the footage of the Sagrada Familia, which comes last in the visual catalog of his works.

My only complaint centers around the rather shoddy dolly shots in the film. Most of the shots in the film are static, but when the camera dollies into or through a space, quite often there are very obvious camera bobbles that from a technical standpoint should never have been edited into the final product. Entering the Nativity facade of La Sagrada Familia, which should be the high point of the film, the penultimate shot is marred by bumpy camera work that the director or DP should have seen and done another take of. This, in my opinion, costs a star, if not a star and a half. But don't let that scare you away, this really is a treat for the eyes and is definitely worth a viewing!",1268265600,,1683,4.644295302013423
1058517,5,6305669430,"Hiroshi Teshigahara, known for films such as the 1964 ""Suna no Onna"" (Woman in the Dunes), ""Otoshiana"", ""Ako"", ""Tanin no kao"" was a painter and a sculptor (Hiroshi Teshigahara graduated from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music).  Raised by Sofu Teshigahara, the founder of the Sogetsu School if Ikebana flower arranging, Sofu was also an artist and knew many well-known artists while growing up and introducing art to Hiroshi when he was younger.

As Hiroshi was pushing for an avante-garde style of art, he was also a blossoming filmmaker and one of his first early footage he shot was back in 1959 when he and his father going to Spain for the first time and even meeting Salvador Dali.  It was at that time when he and his father were both enamored with the works of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi (note: The name ""Antonio"" is also used, esp. for the title of the film) (1852-1926) who designed beautiful buildings, interiors and parks that would influence Japanese artists in the late 1950's and again in the 1980's.

Teshigahara revisited Barcelona in 1984 and was able to create a film on the works of Antoni Gaudi.  Showcasing Gaudi's unique architecture all including his unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona.

""Antonio Gaudi"" can be seen as a documentary or art film as it doesn't feature much dialogue but celebrates Gaudi's work as we see the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, Barcelona, Spanish art, the Palace of Catalan Music, Casa Amatller, Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, the Catalonian countryside, Casa Vicens, Bellesguart, Santa Teresa School, Guell Pavilions, Guell Palace, Guell Cellar, the Sagrada Familia school, La Boqueria Market, Colonia Guell Crypt, Park Guell, Montserrat and the Sagrada Familia cathedral.

This is a celebration for Antoni Gaudi's work and The Criterion Collection known for releasing important classic and contemporary films features a 2-disc DVD set in which Hiroshi Teshigahara immortalizes Gaudi on film and featurettes that also celebrates Antoni Gaudi's work.  It's important to note that the film features his work and is not about Gaudi's life.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Antonio Gaudi"" is presented in its original aspect ratio if 1:33:1.  For a film that is 26-years-old, the film looks absolutely vibrant and colorful.  According to Criterion, the high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm low-contrast print struck from the original negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.

I believed that when Hiroshi Teshigahara went to Spain for the first time with his father, he knew the enormity of what kind of cameras and lenses would be needed to capture his work on film.  Teshigahara and his cinematographers did a wonderful job in capturing the beauty of the architectural work but also capturing the detail.  You see the curves, you see many of Gaudi's work upclose and giving the viewer a first hand look of areas that Teshigahara was captivated by.  Absolutely beautiful camerawork!

As for the audio, there is music which was mastered at 24-bit from the original soundtrack print.  Criterion used audio restoration tools to reduce the clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  There is a short scene with Isidre Puig Boada a Catalan architect connected to Antoni Gaudi who is being interviewed with Japanese dub over by Seiji Miyaguchi.  But audio is Dolby Digital 1.0.  For those with a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1 , 7.2 or higher setup may want to set the audio settings for stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Optional English subtitles are provided as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Antonio Gaudi"" comes with the following special features on disc 2:

  * Gaudi, Catalunya, 1959 - (19:26) In 1959, Hiroshi Teshigahara accompanied his father, Sofu to Spain bringing with him a 16mm camera to film Barcelona, the Catalonian countryside and visiting the home of Salvador Dali in Port Lligat.  The featurette has no sound but definitely a time capsule of footage from that era and also a rare look at Salvador Dali as host for the Teshigahara's.
  * Arata Isozaki Interview - (13:06) A featurette from 2006 with Arata Isozaki (known for designing the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art building) reminiscing of working with Hiroshi Teshigahara, making ""Antonio Gaudi"" and his life.
  * ""God's Architect: Antoni Gaudi"" (59:28) An installment from a three-part BBC architecture series ""Visions of Space"" featuring art critic Robert Hughes exploring the power of religion in the works of Gaudi.
  * Monitor - (15:55) A B&W installment of ""Monitor"" hosted by Ken Russell who focuses on Gaudi's architecture with early photos of Gaudi, his funeral and his work.  Russell directed 21 one short documentaries for BBC's arts television series ""Monitor"".
  * Sculptures by Sofu-Vita - (17:18) A short film by Hiroshi Teshigahara made in 1963.  The installation features his father Sofu Teshigahara's work at a sculpture exhibition at the Sogetsu Institute.  We see the making of the exhibition and close ups of Sofu Teshigahara's sculptures.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Also, included with this two-DVD set is a 38-page booklet featuring an essay by Dore Ashton titled ""Border Crossings"" about Teshigahara's work and influence leading up to the making of ""Antoni Gaudi"".  ""My First Trip to the West"" by Hiroshi Teshigahara used in his producer Noriko Nomura's 2007 book of production notes ""Eiga Koto Hajime"". Also, included is ""A Photographic View of Travels in the West"" featuring a roundtable discussion sponsored by the Sogetsu Camera Club with Sofu and Hiroshi Teshigahara as they returned from their travels in the US and Europe.  Other participants in the roundtable include photographers Ken Domon and Taro Hiramatsu.

I want to see these works of Antoni Gaudi up close!  This is how I felt after I watched Hiroshi Teshigahara's ""Antoni Gaudi"".

What a beautiful film showcasing Antoni Gaudi's work.  Aside from what I have seen from pictures online and postcards, I have never seen the detail of the work of Gaudi until I have seen this film.  Teshigahara and his cameramen did a wonderful job in capturing the mood, the environment, the scenery, the sculptures, you name it...Teshigahara did a great job in having them focus on key areas in order to capture the beauty of the various works of Gaudi.  Just to see his footage of the the Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona was just breathtaking.  To see the detail of the cathedral and his other works was very impressive and after watching this film, I now want to go to Barcelona and see his works up close.

I have to admit that this is one release from The Criterion Collection that is a film that is not going to be for everyone though.  It's more or less for those who have an appreciation for art and architecture and in this case, Gaudi's work.  Think of it more of a visual walkthrough Spain ala 1984 and Teshigahara being your tour guide through various works of Gaudi.  No dialogue, just the visual with accompanying music.

I personally loved this release because it focused on Gaudi's work but also a rare glimpse of Hiroshi Tesihigahara and his father Sofu.  It was a project that began back in 1959 when he accompanied his father to their first trip to Spain and then followed up years after his father's death and capturing the details of the work on film 25-years-later.  So, I would imagine that this film was a personal film for Hiroshi Teshigahara and an important film for him to make as he and his father shared that same passion together.

The amount of extra special features is definitely a major plus and what makes this release so irresistible.  For one, you get the 1959 home video by Hiroshi when he went with his father to Spain but that rare glimpse of Salvador Dali is just priceless.  You also get Hiroshi creating a short film of his father's sculptures back in 1963 for an exhibition and a video interview with a close friend Arata Isozaki who comments on the Teshigahara's and growing up with Hiroshi Teshigahara.  And then you get two solid documentaries on Antoni Gaudi from ""Visions of Space"" and ""Monitor"" which were informative and just delightful to watch.  And also an enjoyable 38-page book which I enjoyed reading.

This is a very unique release for The Criterion Collection and may not be a film for everyone since its more or less a visual documentary on the work of Antoni Gaudi.  But if you are interested in Gaudi's work, especially the artistic side of Hiroshi Teshigahara and his father Sofu, then ""Antonio Gaudi"" is definitely worth having in your collection!",1262822400,3,8675,4.984016678248784

It follows Gaudi's career through the evolution of this architecture. It's a brilliant approach. The Criterion addition also includes a BBC bio, but the host can't see beyond his personal religious upbringing, that is definitely gets in the way of a bio of Gaudi. I have a long time fan of Gaudi, he was one of a kind, his work has never been replicated and he did it on a scale that couldn't happen again. Fascinating.",1258156800,,556,4.46078431372549

The original film (1984) by Teshighara should be watched by a viewer not prone to dozing off. It is mostly silent with some music and subtitles. Visually, it documents the great care, craftsmanship and sensuality in Gaudi's many building surfaces, surreal furniture, fixtures,ironwork, tile, stone, wood, plaster, glass, etc. It helps to be somewhat familiar with his work and life, otherwise the relevance of this series of images laid on end over an hour tends to be lost.
Some of the more refreshing aspects of this compilation include added  features on the second disc, such as interviews, Robert Hugh's fine BBC program exploring Gaudi's life and work, as well as the booklet shedding light on Hiroshi Teshighara's own efforts and passions. Overall, the access to the artistic parallels of both men's lives and works is valuable and interesting but don't expect ""pure Gaudi"".",1209081600,5,1119,5.18232044198895

7892823,4,6305669430,"While some are disappointed by a lack of biographical information and insightful narrative, others will view Teshigahara's film as a visual portrait that inspires awe and wonder. As the camera pans around and through Gaudi's fantastical, sculpturesque structures, it reveals a definite aura of otherworldliness. His truly unique creations are incredibly majestic and beautiful to behold. Gaudi's architecture may not be to everyone's liking, but his work is certain to give rise to the imagination. On occasion, the camera breaks away from the inanimate to focus in on the regional activity, perhaps to give the viewer a change of pace, and/or perhaps to show how people relate to the work of this visionary artist. I'd like to think that with the absence of continuous commentary Teshigahara believed that Gaudi's art would speak for itself. He undeniably brings Antonio Gaudi's legend and vision alive.",1426896000,,904,5.328671328671328
