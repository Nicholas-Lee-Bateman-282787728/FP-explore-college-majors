8311201,4,B000EWIQP0,"I am currently in my second trimester and have been using this video workout for two months.  There are two different workouts and a yoga session.  The first work out is about 25 minutes long and I have not yet tried the second as the first is challenging enough to keep me doing it.  You will need two sets of dumbbells.  Lindsay has three on the video but only uses two, 3 lb. and 8 lb.  I have been using 3 lb. and 5 lb.  There are plenty of exercises for back and arms as well a variety of squats and movements for the legs.  The workout has kept me in shape and, I believe, prepared my back to support the extra weight I have been gaining.  The yoga is a nice cool down or good stretch and tension reliever, but as a novice to yoga I find some of the breathing only parts a tad boring.  I recommend the yoga mat.  One is used in the video and with out it my feet tend to slide on a couple of the poses.

There are a couple of negatives about this video.  Lindsay is not pregnant and watching her smiling and bouncing while you sweat can be annoying.  Occasionally a picture in picture box appears with a woman early in her second trimester doing the workout, but the box is small and pixels out on a large HD TV.  The instruction is usually clear and concise.  However, at one point Lindsay intructs us to throw in a pelvic tilt without any explanation.  I have yet to figure out what she is doing, if anything, as it is not visible on the video. She also intructs us to do a Kegel now and then, but I knew what those were.  The music is awful.  Once I learned the rountine I simply killed the sound and played my own music which helped immensely with my energy level in getting through the whole workout.

Over all I would choose this video again.  I feel like I get a good workout with out feeling like I am overly straining.",1199664000,,1832,4.107042253521127
8311202,4,B000EWIQP0,"I really enjoy doing this workout.  The separate 20 minute yoga section makes a great cooldown.  I also do the yoga on the days when my muscles are recovering from a more intense workout.  This video is fun and while it is not too strenuous, I feel like I have gotten a good workout.",1168300800,4,283,4.203703703703703
