8580014,5,B00CBQPNAI,"Not only do I have a copy of this for myself, but I also got one for my friend who tries to refute her love for Jay Park and loses at every turn. I do wish it were longer and the songs are all chopped together which is relatively annoying--I hate when a song I love comes on and oh hey sorry, it's over. If he had other concert DVDs out I probably would've chosen one of those over this due to that, but as it is, he doesn't. It's worth the purchase if you're a Jay Park fan.",1390262400,2,475,3.808080808080808
