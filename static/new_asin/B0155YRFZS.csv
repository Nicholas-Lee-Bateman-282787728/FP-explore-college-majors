7429094,2,B0155YRFZS,"I really liked the first movie. It had a lot of heart and a lot of chemistry between characters. The idea of a magical kiss in an elevator with a stranger is a difficult concept to pull off well. It was well-done in the first movie but comes off clunky here. The problem with this movie is that the characters aren't as likable as the first one and the romance doesn't seem as natural or obvious. The main character in this one is a lazy womanizer who never seems to have a believable conversion to Mr. nice guy even though he ends up doing some nice things in the end. The mean boss from the first movie shows up in this one again, apparently as someone who has learned her lesson from the last movie and is in better shape now. Unfortunately, she only appears in random scenes in which she always manages to say something about elevators. It seems forced. I bought this movie because I liked the first one. This one doesn't measure up. If you like romantic Christmas movies, you might want to check this out, but don't go into it thinking it's going to be as good as the first one.",1452988800,15,1083,4.287804878048781

This Christmas movie had many PRETTY FACES. The woman that plays
the main character is one, but her biggest asset is that she has a beautiful
heart. She is SO0o sweet she turns a playboy/woman-user, loser, into a
Prince Charming!",1451347200,5,395,4.895522388059701

8732767,3,B0155YRFZS,"I love the hallmark/ion Christmas movies and absolutely adored the first ""Christmas kiss"" movie. So when the second was announced, was excited... should have remembered sequels are rarely as good as originals.

The mean girl from the first movie has redemption in the second, so that was nice, but otherwise it was almost the exact opposite storyline. The first had the interior design assistant Wendy and mean boss' boyfriend Adam falling in love; this one has a clothes designer's assistant Jenna avoiding her boss' smitten brother. The two design firms are in the same building, so there are interactions and references to Adam and Wendy.

All in all it was a cute movie, not nearly as good as the first but worth snuggling up to watch",1519603200,,738,4.849206349206349
