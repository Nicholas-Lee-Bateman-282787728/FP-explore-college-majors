8622099,5,B00GC2MHCY,"This is the BBC show Sounding Out from 1971.  It's a pretty nice presentation.  The DVD is easy to navigate.  The show is complete.  There is a nice booklet (with Jonathan Swift - from that tour - added to the booklet, but not in the DVD).  Nowhere that I could find in the packaging or DVD label or within the DVD menu does it mention that this is the Sounding Out episode, though once the show begins, you realize it's the short documentary - and maybe the best you'll find short of the movie, YesSongs.",1440028800,,505,4.273684210526316
8622100,5,B00GC2MHCY,"The value of this way too short dvd is the fact that it is the ONLY thing out there about Yes that features the best lineup the band ever had, the five musicians who gave us Fragile and Close To The Edge: Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and the incomparable original Yes drummer Bill Bruford. We are dying for anything in the Yes archives from this lineup!
There is plenty of stuff out there from what has later been dubbed the ""classic"" lineup, but that is after Alan White became the drummer. And as everyone knows, Bill Bruford's drumming is essential to the foundational music of Yes. When he left and Alan came in their sound changed completely. And not for the better ( in my humble but firm opinion ).
So we savor these 23 minutes for the time being, in hopes that there is more - far more - still locked away in the archives somewhere. So, to whomever is in charge of these things, PLEASE BRING US MORE OF YES FROM THE BILL BRUFORD YEARS!",1438992000,,967,4.348066298342541
8622101,4,B00GC2MHCY,"One can only imagine what this film could have been with todays technology better much better most likely. With that said it is a look back at what was and still is a group of fantastic musicians. Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Bill Buford & Rick Wakeman. I agree with other who have reviewed this film it is a bummer that the music was interrupted with interviews. That said it dose not bother me and if you are a true Yes fan it should not bother you. You are seeing the first classic line up here minus Alan White who would replace Bill Buford on Tales from Topographic Oceans album. This film is better than the Yessongs film and perhaps they should have mixed both these films. I gave it 4 - stars and recommended it highly for the Yes or progressive rock fan. On a latter thought now that Yes is releasing Progeny: Seven Shows from Seventy-Two perhaps there will be some live shows released on film from those tour back in 1972 I'm keeping my finger crossed...",1433894400,2,975,4.4222222222222225
8622102,5,B00GC2MHCY,"Here I go again, writing another pro-Yes review on the only know live footage of the greates Yes line-up: Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe and Squire; What we now have is 1st official release of the 1972 ""sounding out"" documentary that was produced and broadcast by the BBC to promote the-then new album ""Fragile."" Complainers who lament the fact that these are live excerpts, with interviews interspersed must have reading comprehension problems, since at no time has this been advertised as full-length show. Back in 1971, that did not happen, as it was made for TV! Home video was a fantasy back then, and tv, along with radio was the most effective way of building the legend.",1431475200,4,680,4.870689655172414

8622104,3,B00GC2MHCY,"Taken from the BBC show ""Sounding Out"", Yes-Live at Hemel Hempstead Pavilion October, 3rd 1971 is an exercise in contrasts. First of all this should be a budget priced item. At only 23 minutes long and no extras, the distributor is banking on the fact that this is rare material to get people to shell out the money for it. Established, long time fans who have most everything that the band has put out will probably pay the price. Those who are newer to the band, and coming to the video side of thing for the first time will undoubtedly look elsewhere to find a better bargain.

This DVD package is just about as well thought out and made as it can be for what it is. Inside the case is a semi replica tour program that talks about each of the band members, and even has a page dedicated to the opening act. It's a pretty nice 12 page booklet with plenty of pictures. The DVD case is clear, and when you open it up, there are even more pictures of the group in concert, and interview. Stills obviously taken from the television show. The program is in full frame, and it would have been nice if it would mention somewhere on the outside of the case that this was from a BBC half-hour special with partial performances and interviews. I would feel like I was getting ripped off, expecting a concert. The only thing that hints to something unusual is the 23 minute run time on the back of the package. Fans know that some of the bands songs are longer than this whole program and would probably wonder what was up. Here is the setlist for the (Partial) performances;

1. Introduction
2. Long Distance Runaround Pt. 1
3. I've Seen All Good People
4. Perpetual Change
5. The Fish/Stage Setup
6. Long Distance Runaround Pt. 2
7. Heart Of The Sunrise
8. Long Distance Runaround Pt. 3
9. Mood For A Day
10. Yours Is No Disgrace

Still, we're talking about 43 year old footage here, and it's not in bad shape either. Its fun to see the simple setup of a rock band in the early 70's. Kids today would have a heart attack trying to watch this without the million dollar laser show, dozens of barely dressed dancers, and auto tune on all the vocals. That's what makes this a little piece of history, a little time capsule that shows that true musicianship was the way to make a living. That talent counted more than an expensive light show for entertainment. This is also the simple reason why the band are still around to this day, almost 50 years on they're still making music that's worth hearing.",1411171200,9,2491,4.387445887445887
8622105,1,B00GC2MHCY,"Horrible concept, such a shame for what could have been.  The audio and sound quality of the live footage are pretty decent for 1971, and in fact better than the dreadfully produced Yessongs film, but it's truly assinine to have made this video this way with excerpts of concert footage intermixed with band interviews.  There isn't a single complete live performance of a song uninterrupted from start to finish.  This is more like Yesyears or Yesstories that are documentaries with a touch of live footage here and there.  The company that is advertising this as a live concert is a disgrace.

I loved all the material, but I want to see the whole concert and then watch the band member interviews separately.  It shouldn't have been hard to make the DVD with the live performance vs. interviews separate and in their entirety - especially since this is the only video of the band in the early days with both Bruford and Wakeman playing together.  Yet another Yes DVD that inexplicably goes wrong due to filmmakers having no clue....",1405900800,11,1035,4.780898876404494
8622106,3,B00GC2MHCY,"This item would have been better if it had been clearly advertised that only excerpts of live footage from this concert are contained
in this dvd as none of the tracks the rear of the cover are played in their entirety due to the cuts to interviews with band members (which was not mentioned in the advertising or on the dvd cover). In terms of the live footage that is there to see, it's a good glimpse of the band performing at that stage of their development and with the lineup of band members at that time.",1404691200,,511,4.278350515463917
8622107,3,B00GC2MHCY,"Some great older footage of Yes (and featuring Bill Bruford on drums which is a plus). Unfortunately this suffers from one of my most hated things - let's start a song and play a minute or two of it and just as you really get grooving we'll cut to an interview. This is always so annoying. Obviously the footage exists of the full show and Yes from this era is not something you can find much of so why does it have to be cut into pieces? And in some cases, they don't even bother to come back and complete the song, just move on to the next one. For me, this one won't be pulled out very often to watch but if you can stand the interruptions, then I recommend it especially to see Bruford playing in the early days",1389052800,44,715,4.078014184397163
