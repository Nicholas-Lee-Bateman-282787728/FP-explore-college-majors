8568952,4,B00BI8SEGA,Fascinating to see these ballets as they were performed 50 years ago. Elsa Marianne Von Rosen was one of my teachers so I was excited to see her perform and remember her coaching me.,1461196800,,182,4.382352941176471
8568953,1,B00BI8SEGA,"One has to be truly desperate for some Bournonville to waste money on this DVD. Fortunately, La Sylphide and other Bournonville masterworks are available, as performed by 'the source' - The Royal Danish Ballet.  Go for the late-1980s Sylphide DVD performed by Jeppesen and Hubbe, to see The Real Thing.",1381190400,,302,5.04
8568954,2,B00BI8SEGA,"Lucette Aldous was even worse.  I've seen numerous versions of La Sylphide by numerous dancers, some more true to Bournonville and some better than others.  The best variant is Peter Schaufus's version with Eva Evdokimova for the ENB.  To watch this performance was painful to me as a veteran balletomane and to my friend, a principal dancer who had performed James.  When Flindt displayed 1 1/2 facial expressions, I opined he might be able to get away with it on stage, but not on television.  At no point in this sad spectacle was there any magic of the ballet or in the ballet.  One really has to work very hard to make Bournonville's La Sylphide boring.  So the cast gets an E for Effort.",1376179200,2,693,4.540322580645161
8568955,5,B00BI8SEGA,I remember seeing both of these pieces performed by this cast in the great old days.  I wish more classic performances would be released on disc.,1370390400,,145,4.576923076923077
