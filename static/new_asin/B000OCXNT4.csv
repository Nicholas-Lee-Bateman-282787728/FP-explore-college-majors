2793633,1,B000OCXNT4,"Ok...First of all, this is not a workout by any means!
She teaches you some moves at a very low pace, very uninspiring, terrible quality of the video, it's
worse than homemade.  I suggest Dolphina's burlesque dvd, it's a lot more motivating to do.",1208390400,2,247,4.613636363636363
2793634,2,B000OCXNT4,"It didn`t impress me, perhaps because I didn`t know what burlesque dance was, and was expecting something diferent.",1204934400,,115,5.444444444444445
2793635,2,B000OCXNT4,"This was a total waste of money if one is looking for a fun ""workout"".  The woman was scary, the filming was amateur, the whole thing was tacky.  I mean, I was expecting a little tacky because it is burlesque but this was way beyond over the top.  I was expecting a breakdown of burlesque moves and then a routine using those moves to give me a workout.  Instead there were tips on how to do bumps and grinds, how to stand etc but never did I see an actual routine. HORRIBLE
The ONLY reason that this got a second star is because of the woman with the tassle twirling.  I found it informative, fun and I am ready to run out and find some tassles to give this a try.
The other bonuses were a waste of my time and worse than tacky.  DO NOT GET THIS DVD.  That would be my best advice.",1203033600,7,782,4.006451612903226
2793636,5,B000OCXNT4,This was so much fun. I even plan to make my own costume. The teachers are sort of goofy acting and make it jsut fun to try.,1202428800,4,124,3.6296296296296298
2793637,1,B000OCXNT4,"I found this dvd to be a bit scary, like the woman instructor was really a man in drag. The production value was homemade and it was not a workout, it seems as if the word ""workout"" was added to the packaging afterwards as well as repackaging the cover....the instructor is over-the-top and I found a bit tacky. Back the workout, there are too many interuptions to consider it a workout, but I tried even doing the moves by themselves and repeating them and still found them to be instructional, but not a workout that would have any exercise benefits: cardio, core, flexibility or otherwise. She certainly does not discuss the muscles you are using or should be focusing on. Burlesque seems to be a rare topic,and this was the only one I could find, but I am sure there will be more dvds soon, I just ordered Carmen Electra's new Bedroom & Cardio Burlesque by Dolfina and I will let you know how those are when I receive them!",1198195200,6,927,4.458823529411765
2793638,5,B000OCXNT4,"All Hail the Princess! I love this dvd - what a fun, novel workout! Princess Farhana is a wonderful, old school style burlesque dancer and her performance alone is worth the price of the video. She also gives great advice on costuming. If you are interested in feeling sexy and feminine this dvd is the perfect choice.",1189728000,8,318,4.5964912280701755
2793639,4,B000OCXNT4,"This is a great instructional video but it really can't be classified as a ""burlesque workout"". The movements demonstrated are informative for developing a routine but if you are looking for a workout, this probably won't be it, primarily due to the order of presentation. There is good information on costumes, stage personas, even picking a name - but the poor production quality lowered my rating to a 4. Get this if you want to develop a burlesque dance routine but look elsewhere for calorie burning.",1185840000,19,505,4.883720930232558
2793640,5,B000OCXNT4,"I would highly recommend this d.v.d.
It is well done and very informative.",1185753600,5,74,4.769230769230769
2793641,5,B000OCXNT4,"If you're looking for a dvd that will guide you to that inner diva, then this is the one to buy!  I was really very surprised by the information/tips given in this dvd on make-up, clothing removal, costumes, pasties, poses, etc... (don't want to give everything away)

Very clear instruction is given on how to do basic striptease moves and the final routine will have you looking and feeling like a very special diva! Hint: You'll need a big boa and sequined lingerie to look the part, girlfriend!

I only wish the combinations had been separated from the tips on other things in this dvd.  I tended to get a bit caught up in the tips, then I'd forget the striptease move that was taught.  This dvd could have used some better organization!

The bonus material which gives a brief history of burlesque, tassel twirling instruction, Velvet Hammer Preview and Farhana's live performance of the routine presented are all excellent!  The routine that is taught is actually repeated 3 different times and the music is so very sexy!!

So find some heels, boa and glittery lingerie and shake what yo' mama gave you so you can enjoy this dvd!",1185494400,19,1135,4.668341708542713
8184396,1,B000OCXNT4,"Disappointing to say the least. Jo Weldon has a much better instructional video. I'm not sure why Hot Moves is titled ""workout"" because there isn't anything about it that is a workout (though that was indicated in other reviews). I didn't buy it for the ""workout"" but hoping for a more instructional slant. That's where Weldon's video was much more appropriate.",1510358400,,361,4.934426229508197
8184397,4,B000OCXNT4,"So fun and fabulous, but I was looking for more of a work out video than a burlesque how-to video",1399939200,,97,3.9
8184398,4,B000OCXNT4,"Not as much dancing as I expected, more time on costuming which was fine, but the bonus made the dvd absolutely great!  I have played just Ms. Indigo section for dozens of people.",1387843200,,179,4.424242424242424
8184399,1,B000OCXNT4,I looked through this dvd and it was awful.  My daughter wants this dvd for Christmas so after she receives it gives her opinion I may say something positive.,1381017600,,158,4.448275862068965
8184400,5,B000OCXNT4,"I'm taking a burlesque 101 class and this DVD is like a 101 tutorial. It's an overview of different types of movements and stripping techniques. This is a must-have DVD if you love burlesque and want to build confidence in your movements and transitions. For me it feels like a 6 week burlesque class that has been condensed into a (just under) 2 hour material review. I love having a DVD that can help me practice different aspects of burlesque like entrances, exits, and poses. The choreography is cute and is played 3 times in a row, so you can do it from start to finish repeatedly with brief pauses to get dressed again. There's a costume section which ends with a thorough discussion of how to find, stick on, and remove pasties. It feels like Princess Farhana is your big sister guiding you through the basics of the art.  Its perfect for someone who is new to and wants to practice the art of burlesque performance.  If you've ever fantasized about becoming a sassy, bold, and beautiful burlesque performer, this is an excellent DVD to help you begin on your journey.",1352332800,,1075,4.59375
8184401,5,B000OCXNT4,"What a fun DVD. Not a ""workout"" but more like a guide for the beginner to Burlesque dancing. It covers a bit of everything.

It has great tutorials on the Burlesque moves and covers alot of other material ranging from how to apply pasties- to  the art of ""tease,"" and how to get that sexy, effortless look as you ""take it off."" I have a few exotic dancing/Burlesque DVDs, and this one covered the most detailed information, I have seen about that.

And so many great-great tips from not only the Princess, but also other top Burlesque artists. Like-""If the dancer does not believe she is sexy, neither will your audience.""

It is sectioned like this:
-Personal Note from Princess Farhana (nice)
-Costuming
-Short Warm-up
-Posture & Arms
-Entrance Walks
-Boa Technique
-Bumps & Grinds
-Art of the Tease
-Taking It Off
-End Poses
-Exit Walks
-Putting It All Together (picking a name, ideas & concepts for your dance, showmanship, trouble shooting tips, etc.)
-Review (short follow along choreography with
  on-screen cues so you know what's coming next.)
-Performance (live costumed performance)
BONUS-
Clips from the Velvet Hammer Burlesque Show
Burlesque History
""How to"" on Tassel Twirling with Miss Indigo Blue

This DVD pleasantly surprised me. There is really alot of great material here on Burlesque. And I was just expecting a dance workout. The production (sound, lighting, sets) value is good, but if you are expecting slick, MTV looking sets & visuals you might want to look elsewhere.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning Burlesque dancing. It's great because what is taught can be applied either way-for those who want to do it for fun at home (like me) or for those who really want to perform.",1334620800,5,1729,4.897260273972603
8184402,4,B000OCXNT4,"As many reviewers have already noted this is NOT a workout video.  And why they had to confuse the customers by labeling it as one I don't know.  Happily, I was already warned of this by other buyers so I bought this without any false expections to disappoint.  And I was NOT disappointed!  Yes, the quality of the film is amateurish, which is part of the charm.  I kept on imagining the camera being held by one of Princess's ""Girls"" and ignored the jittery camerawork and sometimes jarring flow of action.  I found the instructions easy to follow and was able to put together a complete dance routine in less than two weeks time, just in time to perform my routine as a special Anniversary present for my Sweetie.  My partner was VERY happy with the results and I will Definately be using this video again in future.  Best part of the video:  I FINALLY learned how to twirl tassels!!! Thank you Miss Indigo Blue!

8184403,3,B000OCXNT4,"I purchased this and have used it maybe once. Its not what I expected and dosn't really do that many moves or go thoroughlly through the moves. More for the already advanced dancer I think.
Thanks!!!",1298592000,,199,4.555555555555555
8184404,1,B000OCXNT4,"I bought this because I was looking for a way to trick myself into thinking I wasn't working out. The video looks like it was shot in an apartment. The whole thing from start to finish was horrible. I think she spent twenty minutes alone on different types of feather boas. We get it honey, it's feathers on a string.
Only buy this if you want a good laugh.",1286755200,,357,4.188405797101449
8184405,4,B000OCXNT4,"I will agree with some of the reviewers - this is not a workout video. But I'm glad. I have no interest in workout videos. If I want to work out I'll go the gym.

I purchased this DVD on a recommendation and I wasn't disappointed! Admittedly, the production quality isn't great but really, since I doubt mainstream Hollywood is going to step up, I have to give the Princess kudos. This is a great introduction to the world of burlesque and Princess Farhana is a delightful teacher. I only wish I lived in LA so I could check out some of her performances and classes there.

As for the reviewers who called the Princess ""scary,"" ""unprofessional,"" and a ""man in drag""... I'm baffled. Princess Farhana is a beautiful woman who comes across with a wonderful personality. She is also a internationally reknowned bellydancer who has taught dance for years and written extensively on the subjects of bellydance and burlesque.

If you're interested in learning about burlesque there are lots of great resources due to the popularity of neo-burlesque and the burlesque revival. This video is definitely one of the must-haves!",1217548800,24,1116,4.832460732984293
