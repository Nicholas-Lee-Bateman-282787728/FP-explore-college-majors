3724381,1,B001NY6YTI,"BOOOO! Don't buy this movie. This new version sucks so bad. It's not the original story line I remember from the book or the 1985 video adaption narrated by Meryl Streep, with music by George Winston.

Buy the old version, it's better. Seriously.",1238976000,8,253,4.7272727272727275
3724382,5,B001NY6YTI,We watched the DVD last night.  The kids enjoyed it.  Very heart warming. One of my kids found her plush animals she hadn't played with in a long time and has been hugging it ever since watching this DVD.  It brought back found memories of the joy of using your imagination when playing with your toys.,1237766400,6,302,4.357142857142857
3724383,5,B001NY6YTI,"While there have been many versions of this tale told before, this movie would have to be the definitive version, in my opinion. Based upon Margery Williams's 1922 novel, ""The Velveteen Rabbit""; it is a story that children and adults alike agree that truly moves the soul.

While his father is off to conduct business, Toby is left in the care of his grandmother. It's clear from the get-go that she is very intolerable of children. Forced to entertain himself there, he comes across Rabbit. Rabbit is a stuffed toy who comes alive in Toby's imagination. Toby also meets Swan and Horse who also comes alive in his imagination. All three toys hope to be made into real animals by the power of love. Soon, Toby's grandmother comes around and realizes how she has been with Toby. Yet, Toby comes down with scarlet fever. This threatens the safety of the toys so they urge him to reach out to his father before it is too late. It is a reimagining that tells of the power of affection.

I tell you, I've never been so moved by a children's movie as I have with this one. I was moved to tears by movie's end, I have to admit. Michael Landon Jr. truly outdoes himself directing this feature, which features a mix of live-action, CGI, and 2-D. Alternating between reality and Toby's mind. While I've seen other movies directed by Landon Jr., this-by far- has to be his best work. I'd love to see him direct other children's stories like this.

The Velveteen Rabbit features the voices of Golden Globe winner Jane Seymour, Emmy Award winner Tom Skerritt, and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn. Chandler Wakefield provides the voice of Rabbit.

I highly recommend this movie to all. It is a very heartbreaking but uplifting story.",1237507200,4,1721,4.651315789473684
3724384,5,B001NY6YTI,"One of the best children movies I have seen in a long time. It makes you wish you could be a child again and that it's not to late ever to still believe like a child. I don't know why two negatives were given,perhaps the two individuals have forgotten what it's like to believe in make-believe.",1237420800,4,294,4.267857142857143
3724385,5,B001NY6YTI,"This movie is absolutely wonderful, just like the book. It is a powerful story which is timeless and very true to life. The first time I read this story as an adult, I was moved to tears; the same is true with this movie. (I guess it was put out on the shelf early, judging from the release date, because I found this movie at Target the other day for $9.99.) The movie is well done in every way, from the acting to the music to the scenery. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is worth the price. Buy it; watch it; share it!

3724435,5,B001NY6YTI,"As stated before, ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" is pretty much my most favorite of fairytales.  Something about it touched significantly when I was a child, and still does to this day.  With that said, I had some misgivings about seeing this film.  On the one hand, I was curious as to how they would pull this off (especially being a combination of animation and live-action), but on the other hand, I did not want to see them butcher MY fairytale.

Anyone who read the book will immediately find by the opening scene that this is not the tale ""your Mom read you"".  And as you go on, so many things were changed.  I was slightly disconcerted.  Normally, variations don't bother me, but when it comes to something that has such nostalgic power and connection to you, it can be difficult sometimes.  But I stuck with it and found that this version is a wonderfully imagined and matured tale.  It ingeniously implements the main plot points and keeps the spirit of the original, but brings fresh light to the key point of the tale, "" 'Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.' ""

CONTENT ISSUES:
This film was intended to be a family film and it stays true to that purpose.  There is absolutely nothing that I could find to be particularly offensive on any level.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
One thing that is nice about this film is that it has a clear direction and nothing is too ambiguous.  Children can easily follow this movie.  But, there is a lot of meat and content for older viewers as well.  All audiences of any age will understand the main tale of love...but more mature viewers will be able to muse over more subtle themes of faith, cynicism, naivete, regret, and redemption.  It's a tale that really tries to appeal to everyone...in a good way.  The pacing was actually quite good.  What I really digged though was that though this is a VERY liberal execution of the source material, they still followed the key plot points and implemented very imaginative ways of executing them.  The ways they crafted it allowed the plot points to better fit their direction, while still maintaining the nostalgia that most who have read the original will appreciate.  The only thing is, I would have slightly changed the ending to give a stronger resolution for some of the other toys...but if I told you how, that would border on spoiling things.  I was moved to tears at points...similar to when I read the original.

CHARACTERS:
I found the characters, in general, to be likable and effective.  Nana and Dad were my favorites to watch as they evolved...and their struggles were things that many deal with to this day.  The only character I found that irked me just a little was the rabbit himself.  Now, in a way it actually worked out best that way because it gave the rabbit room to grow as you did see him mature as the movie went on...but initially, he was a little ""too much"" for me at points.  Still, any faults the rabbit may have had were totally eclipsed by the tale as a whole.

EXTRAS:
Honestly, the special features are negligible.  There are cast interviews, cast bios, and deleted scenes.  Of all of these, I love documentary type things so Cast Bios and Cast interviews naturally are my first draw.  However, the cast bios are basically a paragraph or two that you read...I would have previewed that they present themselves or something.  And as to the cast interviews...it was short with not much information.  Just some opinions and feelings...but really I felt they could have done something so much more meaningful with this.  It just seemed like it was there to just be able to say it was there.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a beautiful and stirring rendition of a tale as old as time.  The characters were well represented, the tale itself was wonderfully and imaginatively executed...and the spirit of the original tale still rings true.  It's hard not to be moved by this one.  By the end, just like the original book, it challenged me and the way I see things.",1415577600,3,4134,4.575510204081633

3724483,1,B001NY6YTI,"Movies like this steaming pile of rabbit droppings make me sad that money gets wasted on their production (and viewing) instead of just given away to the indigent. The story is wretched. The characters morph without apparent justification from one bad stereotype to another. Their actions are equally senseless. For example, the boy--who seems afflicted with dissociative identity disorder--fritters his time interacting with animals he only just met instead of dreaming up scenes with his missing mother and father.

While I hadn't read the book before, I did so afterwards (incredulous that this movie represented what the famous book was about), and I found that a charming story about love, faith, and the nature of reality had been perverted into something so treacly and cloying that they bore almost no resemblance to each other.

There are SO many better ways to spend one's time and money.",1382313600,2,898,5.1438356164383565

First off, I LOVE the costumes that the live actors are wearing...it's very somber and provides a nice contrast to the lively cartoon world that the boy transports himself to. The characters are wonderful, the animation is nice, there are points where I was kind of rolling my eyes a little bit as the animators' timing seemed to be a little off, such as the rabbit being stuck in mid-air, right before he was going to fall to the floor, the hesitation-factor seemed hokey but that said, it was good clean cartoon viewing for my tot.",1318550400,2,658,4.446280991735537

3724589,4,B001NY6YTI,"This movie has the same basic message as the book: Love makes you real. But it is not meant to be a perfectly faithful adaptation; rather, the book is a springboard for the fanciful journey the movie takes. The movie's credits state that it is ""inspired by"" Margery Williams' story.

Michael Landon did a great job of retaining the heart of the book while telling a very enjoyable story that stands on its own right. It is wonderful to see how love opens up the characters over the course of the movie and changes them for the better. Definitely a tearjerker (for adults anyway). The story borrows themes from several classic children's tales, such as The Secret Garden and Pollyanna, and weaves them together with the moral of the Velveteen Rabbit to create an inspiring, heartwarming tale.

I still would love to see a faithful live action or animated adaptation of the Velveteen Rabbit. I found the Meryl Streep narrated version to be slow and boring -- why sit there and watch that when I could just go read the book? But this movie does bring the same feelings and thoughts to me as reading the book does, even with the changes made to the story.",1297900800,8,1151,4.58252427184466

It is an adorable movie that was just released this year and it is a wonderful family movie for any time of the year.

The Velveteen Rabbit is a story where a young boy is sent to visit with his grandmother during the holidays.  As any child, he is curious and soon discovers the houses `magic attic' where three forgotten toys, including the velveteen rabbit, unlock a world of imagination.  The movie combines both animated sequences and live action, which I thought would turn my cartoon-loving sons off, but they fell in love with the characters.  They were confused with the story but don't seem to mind and I know they soon appreciate the story.

Overall, this movie appealed to all of us, from my 17 month old son to myself and it is hard to find movies we all like.

3724668,5,B001NY6YTI,"""The Velveteen Rabbit"", Margery William's 1922 story, is a classic in the annals of children's literature. I loved it as a child, and continue to adore it as a grown woman, and have since shared it with my own preschooler. Thus, when I saw this new release, I could not wait to watch it with my daughter.

Young Toby [Matthew Harbour] is sent to stay with his strict grandmother Ellen [Una Kay] when his serious father, John goes off on business to New York. Feeling abandoned and lonely, Toby explores the house and comes across the ""Magic Room"", which is filled with his father's old toys, including a rabbit stuffed toy. As Toby's imagination is given free rein, Rabbit comes 'alive' in a lively world of animation, and Toby together with rabbit and the other toys in the magic room run free and play in a lively dream world. The animals, i.e. Horse [Tom Skerritt], Swan [Ellen Burstyn], and Rabbit [Chandler Wakefiled] all dream of becoming real animals, and as we all know from ""The Velveteen Rabbit"", that can only be achieved by true love. Grandma Ellen and Toby soon bond, but his father John is still distant, and it takes a near tragedy to set things right.

A mixture of animated sequences and live-action, this movie appealed to my family. Though the original story has been adapted here, I felt that the adaptation doesn't stray too far from the original message of love overcoming all obstacles. Purists may not appreciate this adaptation, but those seeking family-friendly entertainment will love it.",1251763200,18,1515,4.800766283524904

He conjures up an entire world to play in, complete with a huge tree and a pond. In this magical world he can even fly and his mother appears. The toys in the attic also become animated and together they have lots of adventures. But it is the toy stuffed rabbit that Toby loves the most. But can he love the rabbit enough to make it real? You will love the fantastical world Toby is able to create and fear for him when he has scarlet fever. This story has a happy ending and I think it is appropriate for children of all ages.

the plot

The time is somewhere around the early 1920s in America, and after the death of his mother, Toby must stay with his grandmother, Ellen while his father John is at work in New York. Toby is too small to stay at home alone while his father works. Ellen's home is big and spacious, and up in the attic there is a big playroom that Ellen had made for Toby's father John when he was a young boy to keep him out of her way. Up in the attic, Toby had found some real old toys, a rocking horse and a swan along with a present sitting on a shelf that looked kind of new.

Toby was surprised to find that the present was actually for him, it had his name on it and it read love Mom' on it. A present from his mother, whom he missed very much. He opened up the box and found a stuffed brown and white rabbit. He hugged the rabbit, and thought of his mom and a tear slid down his check and onto the rabbit. When the rabbit was struck with the tear, he became alive. The rabbit told Toby that if he really tried hard he could imagine a whole lot more, and he did. He imagined a whole new animated world, where he found himself to be animated as well. He also brought Swan and Horse to life to play with in this magic attic.

Toby played in the attic all the time, only to come down once in a while, when his stuffy old grandmother called him. It was around Christmas time, and they went to pick out a tree. This was the first time that his grandmother Ellen had put up a tree in her home in many years. This seemed to ease her disposition, and when Toby called her Nana, (a secret that Swan had told Toby of what Ellen had called her grandmother when she was young), the two became friends as well as relatives. But when Toby came down with a severe case of scarlet fever, his father is called back to the house and the family waits for the real magic to happen.

the breakdown

Like most people I have heard of the story of the Velveteen Rabbit all my life, yet admittedly I had never heard the story before this 2009 film. I am guessing that this version is also different from the original book written by Margery Williams, since there are two screen writers assigned to this film. It so happens that I had this DVD lying around my house unopened and on a whim I decided to take a look at it. I watched about a half hour of the film, and stopped it so that I can include my family as well. What a fantastic surprise that we now have a new favorite Christmas film to watch every year.  really didn't know what to expect from this film, yet I am aware of how much of a favorite this story is to so many. It could have been a toss up as far as I know. Where the Wild Things Are was one of my favorite childhood books, and I thought that the movie blew.

The lonely story of Toby is a common one, but it's sad as well. His mother died, his father is too busy, it's like Cats in the Cradle times two. Yet the magic that most lonely children wish for comes true for Toby, his toys come to life because he wishes hard enough for it. The animated paradise which was created in the attic reminded me a little of Winnie the Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood, except here nothing was impossible as long as you had imagination. I love that there was a history with the two other toys, as Horse was his father's toy, and Swan was his Nana's toy. Both Horse and Swan had stories to tell from long ago and how much fun they had with John and Ellen.

Matthew Harbour who plays Toby was the perfect actor for this part. Not only did his live action performance pull at the heartstrings but he has a great voice for animation as well. Ellen Burstyn's voice seemed to fit the personality of Swan very well, yet Tom Skerritt's voice over needed some actual acting. His mood swings needed to ape those of John, Toby's father and so his voice kind of changes with his moods. Una Kay plays Ellen, Toby's grandmother and she effectively pulls off this hoity-toity attitude. Jane Seymour seems to have a wonderful soothing voice as Toby's mother. Speaking of the music, I caught myself wincing at each and every build-up of one of the songs sung by the cast, yet it was all for nothing as the soundtrack turned out to be okay.

I understand that it's a bit far-fetched to name this as one of my new favorite Christmas movies, as it really doesn't center too much on the holiday, except for a Christmas tree, but I feel that Michael Landon, Jr. effectively captures the spirit of the season, what so many other bad movies try to capture and yet fail every year on the Hallmark channel and the like. This one is a sure winner, and has instantly become an annual tradition in my home.
