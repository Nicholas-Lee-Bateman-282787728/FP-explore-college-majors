8171125,3,B000MR9EU8,"SEX MACHINE is an ultra-low-budget hoot!  Extremely rough around the edges - particularly in terms of acting - one can't help but fall in love with the sheer zeal and energy of this movie.  It's the kind of film teenagers make with aspirations of one day working in Hollywood, only done with a skill and vitality far exceeding what one would expect.

Reportedly made guerilla style for 7 grand, SEX MACHINE centers on a man who awakens with amnesia and finds his body has been pieced together from several others.  What follows is part action film, part comedy, part conspiracy thriller, and all exploitation flick.

Full of flaws and confident in itself enough to fly past them, SEX MACHINE is the rare kind of B-movie: as trashy as it is fun.  Let's hope someone gives director Christopher Sharpe a real budget, because it's pretty staggering what he already do without one.",1183939200,2,876,4.768211920529802
