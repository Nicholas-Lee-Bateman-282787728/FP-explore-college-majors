1107081,3,6305869316,"The DVD I saw had a very grainy image which proved distracting at times (such as the scene of a downpour -- was that laboratory-inserted rain or graininess?). The poor imagery kept me from becoming totally involved.

Another distraction was the use of a first-person narration voiced, oddly enuf, by James Mason (I guess there were no Iranian actors available back in 1976). He supposedly narrated the actual thoughts of the tribe's leader -- but that wasn't stated anywhere. Either way, that seems counter to the principle stated at the beginning of the film that nothing in this film was faked or re-enacted.

Because the film concentrates on the annual trek from the low to high pastures, much cultural detail is sacrificed. In fact, many curious events are left unexplained. Often, I felt like a young child -- seeing but not understanding.

At least, the individuals themselves are interesting. The arrogant leader. His cynical comments on the people around him and of people he meets along the way. The costumes. The incredible, upright posture of these nomads. The protesting pack animals.

But overpowering it all is the breathtaking trek over land and river, up the steep Zagros Mountains and over it's snowy summit to the welcoming summer pastures. There's a brief scene that seems to distill that effort in which a young girl piggy-backs a child seemingly half her size while working her way up the precipitous mountainside.

(According to Wikipedia, as of 2006 a small percentage of Bakhtiari still made the journey -- but with transport for the herds and they didn't go barefoot in the snow.)",1188777600,5,1891,5.481099656357388
1107082,5,6305869316,It's one of the best documentary film I've seen. It's sequel to Grass which was released 1925. I highly recommend both movies.,1172534400,,126,4.7727272727272725
1107083,4,6305869316,"From 1976, one of the great anthropological adventure documentaries, PEOPLE OF THE WIND (Image), is a stunning account of the Bakhtiari tribe's annual 200 mile, eight-week migration up the massive Zagros Mountains for higher pastures.

500,000 strong, on foot and with their million head herds, the tribe fords the freezing Cholbar river and scales icy Alp-like peaks of the Zardeh Kuh mountains to reach their fertile secondary homes.  Extraordinary cinematography, coupled with poetic narration by James Mason makes this first person account vivid and memorable.

If you think you have it hard driving to work in bumper-to-bumper traffic, see this amazing widescreen, color film of human endurance and appreciate the cushy life you have.",1158451200,4,739,5.464912280701754
1107084,5,6305869316,"This documentary is most interesting film I have seen in recent years about this forgotten people.  This film is about Bakhtiary tribe annual journey from their winter pasture into their summer highlands.  The movie takes you on a wonderful trip into the most rugged, yet beautiful scenery of inner Iran.  The music only amplifies your joyous odyssey from numerous river crossings and mountainous trails.  A must have collection for anyone with a kin eye for beauty.",1013040000,10,466,5.092105263157895
1107085,5,6305869316,"This is an engrossing documentary of the Bakhtiari migration in which about 500,000 men, women, and children, along with approximately one million animals, spend eight weeks of hardship in their struggle to cross the Zagros mountains in order to reach summer pastures for their livestock.

Their two hundred miles odyssey is told in the words of the leader of the Babahdi tribe. His words are voiced over by actor James Mason. His story is as compelling, as it is amazing. It is difficult to believe that a people would so endure a journey of such hardship year after year.

There is no road through the mountain, only trails or passages worn over time. It is, indeed, rough and rugged terrain over which to cross. The people climb, unroped, these 15,000 foot peaks, herding along their livestock, in clothing and footwear that does not inure them to the ravages of frostbite and illness. You see young children herding animals on precipices that would give most people pause.

It is a primitive, yet communal way of life. The film provides the viewer with a fascinating glimpse into a lifestyle which would be foreign to most. It is compelling, documentary film- making at its best. It is a film that would appeal to all those interested in other cultures, as well as in the human condition.",978134400,21,1292,4.7847533632287

7899214,3,6305869316,"Oh dear! I first watched this docu about 30 years ago and it was one of my favourites. I was very happy to find the dvd on amazon, but was rather frustrated to learn that ""my"" version, which contained texts and songs by the British-Iranian singer and writer Shusha Guppy has little in common with this longer documentary, where all references to Shusha Guppy have been eliminated, while her Persian music has been displaced by some rather irrelevant jingles. Ok, the second version is much longer, so you get more minutes for the buck. But what has James Mason got to do with Iranian culture?!",1459814400,,593,4.6571428571428575

What I gather most from films like these is how hard other people have it, and how spoiled we are.

7899220,4,6305869316,"I have a weakness for older documentaries, and I noted this one while searching for something else on Amazon.

This film is entitled  ""People of the Wind""  (1976)  and is directed by  Anthony Howarth.  It is described as 110 minutes in length, with a release date of 6/6/2000. Narration by James Mason (who died in 1984).

I already have another documentary about the Bakhtiari migrations, entitled, not surprisingly, ""Bakhtiari Migration""  also directed by  Howarth, with a running time  of just  52 minutes. Its also for sale on Amazon.

I wonder if the first may be a different release, with additional footage  shot at the same time as ""Bakhtiari Migration."".  If anyone knows,  I'd appreciate  their input.

Finally, there is the 1925 documentary (silent)  ""Grass: A Nation's Battle For Survival""  by the great early documentarians Marian C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack  (who by the way did the 1933 ""King Kong"").

The two films I already own are thoroughly engrossing and are examples of the best in early documentary film-making.

I hope someone can comment on my question.  And I also wish Amazon would be more precise in their product descriptions when it comes to pertinent dates. Date of production, date of release, and edition date all all important, and often separate and distinct.  Example: ""Battleship Potemkin"" which has several great editions by Kino (including a new blu-ray edition) which  put to shame all the others of inferior quality.",1272499200,2,1460,5.059071729957806

The film depicts elegance among challenging conditions. And the music! G.T. Moore's rock guitar accompanying Shusha's rich voice echoing off of canyons. While I haven't heard the recording in years, I can still hear the music in my head. Yes, the reproduced film is grainy, but try to get beyond that and you will immerse yourself into an exquisite journey.",1221350400,2,503,4.662921348314606
