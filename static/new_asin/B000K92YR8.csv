8155162,2,B000K92YR8,"This mock drama about how easy it is to get nuclear weapons inside America SHOULD have been frightening. It lacked the horror factor it should have had to get it's point across. The acting was poor and the Ho-Hum attitude made the piece loose it's real meaning. Wish a better job had been done, because this issue is a real problem that needs greater attention.",1246924800,,361,4.569230769230769

8155164,4,B000K92YR8,"This film is a release by NTI (Nuclear threat Initiative), the MacArthur Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. I believe Warren Buffett donates heavily to NTI. Anyways, the film is a mock drama of how terrorists can get ahold of nuclear weapons and how they can diffuse them within our modern society.

This movie goes through several routes of how a nuclear weapon can be acquired, and it goes to through great lengths to show just how they may get it into the United States. The movie is interesting, and remarkably goes into pretty good detail while keeping the viewer interested in the subject.

 I'd recommend watching the movie, however Lastbestchance.org has an area where you can have a copy sent to you for free. However, if you don't want to give them your address and name, this may be a better option.",1189296000,3,816,4.732394366197183
