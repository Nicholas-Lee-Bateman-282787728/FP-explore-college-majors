7070909,4,B00USBLXC0,"I was excited when I heard the season was for sale on Amazon now, but this price is ridiculous.  I may end up having to delete the episodes from my DVR without having them on DVD, which will make me sad - but not sad enough to pay more than twice what I paid for the last couple of seasons.",1428624000,16,290,3.8333333333333335

7070918,5,B00USBLXC0,"So many emotions in each season.  The comedy was my favorite aspect of the shows.  Was always anticipating for the week to hurry
so I could see what would happen next.  Loved most of the characters and disliked some but eventually changed my mind for the better.
I would definitely recommend DROP  DEAD  DIVA.  It was very entertaining.  Wish it was still playing.",1443830400,2,364,4.682539682539683

8708096,5,B00USBLXC0,I thoroughly enjoyed all of the episodes and was very happy with the fact that Deb and Grayson ended up together.  I got ready to order Season 5 and was surprised that there even was a Season 6 because I thought that the series had been canceled after Season 5.  I think Brooke Elliott is a terrific talent and will look forward to seeing her in other shows in the future.,1489017600,,372,4.225352112676056
8708097,3,B00USBLXC0,"I'm an older man and for some reason I can tolerate LifeTime style shows better than in the past. So I picked up the first few seasons of this show for about $10 each. I liked the show enough to be interested in getting the entire series -- but not at the ridiculous price for the last season which has not come down over time. I finally just watched it on Netflix. The show is not so good that I would have bought any on DVD if all seasons were available on Netflix when I discovered it, but I now have 5 of 6 seasons on DVD. Maybe the last season will drop to $10 some day and I can complete my DVD collection. Maybe not. I'm guessing not many people will pay more than $10 for the last season on DVD when they can just watch it on Netflix. People who are pricing DVDs need to get a clue. I give the show 4 stars, and nick a star for the attempt to gouge. Amazon should have multiple ways to rate shows, because I often nick stars off very good shows because of the marketing greed. This DVD season was released April 2015. It is way past time to drop the price if anyone who has stocked these wants to unload them.",1482883200,2,1117,4.013452914798206
8708098,5,B00USBLXC0,"Haven't watched it yet, but sure I will love it.  Put 5 stars because didn't want to put only one star.",1476489600,,103,3.9047619047619047
8708099,5,B00USBLXC0,"This series was a sleeper hit for me. Didn't watch it when it was originally broadcast because the title didn't appeal to me. But on the recommendation of a friend, I ordered it on Netflix. Was able to get all but seasons 5&6 through Netflix. Couldn't wait for Netflix to acquire the remaining 2 seasons - who knows how long that would be. So I bought the remaining discs from Amazon. Totally worth it! This TV show was fun, engaging, and the people relationships didn't feel phony. Liked all the characters. Turned out to be one of my top favs after all.",1474156800,,555,4.450980392156863
