I would have written it differently - my subtitle for this would have been ""Leverage your Life - what you think, who you know, who knows you and what you do with your tools & time for Bigger Life Results!""

I really enjoyed this DVD - so much that I could easily watch it more than once just to dig the nuggets of wisdom from Raj's presentation.

A couple of the nuggets that captured my attention:

In business, think ""long term"" but not slow - Speed is of the essence.

Company rule ""no news discussed during working hours"". Discussion of news of the recession does not produce any motivation or results, it only drains energy & productivity.

How to get ""yes"" answers more often when making a request - one tip is make requests of people who will view your request as an invitation to move forward for their own goals.

What is Creative Generosity? Consider freely sharing your information on your blog and in your social networking. The people that will hang around just to get something for free will always be around - but those that are you ideal client will pre-qualify themselves and because of you freely share of your creativity they will seek to connect with you - hire you for more specific needs.

In building your own personal brand, Raj talks about being ""uncommon & valuable"" in your marketplace.

In networking - online & offline - he talks about adding value to your network by moving them beyond their goal or towards their goal faster, because they know you. I like the graphs & charts he uses to give an image to this function in networking - identifying & quantifying value is a big missing factor for most people and organizations that network.

Raj's process of thinking and approaching many very common business situations challenged and inspired me to dig deeper into a new mindset of bringing value & connecting with my own marketplace.",1248220800,,1955,4.659883720930233
