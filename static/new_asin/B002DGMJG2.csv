8365093,5,B002DGMJG2,BEAR RUN was thought provoking and moving.  I really connected with many of the characters.  I originally watched it on Logo.  It was much better watching it without all of the commercial breaks.  This documentary is a beautiful tribute to the Bear Community!,1245196800,2,259,4.953488372093023
