8670590,3,B00M7E7GJK,"I rate this product 3 for the invaluable footage it contains of Cuba before, during and after 1959. As a documentary ""The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution"" is not good: it is more a flat montage of images that Errol Flynn's Russian partner Victor Pahlen photographed and then edited with Flynn's introduction and closing lines, marches and chachachas. For someone who does not care about the history of Latin America, this work may have not value, but for those interested in history in general, it is an amazing journey to Cuba, watching images of dictator Fulgencio Batista, his chief of police, the army, the revolution leader Fidel Castro, his brother Ral Castro, Ernesto ""Che""Guevara, the rebels and the people, seeing footage of the massacres of soldiers and civilians, American tourists being hosted by Batista, cabarets, casinos, the rebellion, the entrance of the bearded victors to La Habana, the trials, an execution by firing squad, and many more images of what that island was then. Unfortunately it lacks direct sound so we are subjected to narration and (silly) sound effects. Still it is a moving portrait of the sincere ingenuity of all concerned: the people, the makers, the viewers. The conclusion is highly ironic when we watch the then ""people"" of Venezuela receiving Castro during a visit to their country... The copy available has its soundtrack damaged and some parts are almost inaudible. Of highly historical and archival value, but those who are not interested, avoid it.",1448841600,4,1501,5.105691056910569
