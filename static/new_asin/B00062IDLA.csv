2160815,4,B00062IDLA,"Season 6 seemed to be the dnoument to this series.  It was consistently good overall.  My favorite episode had to ""Dragon's Teeth"" where Janeway and crew discover these old transwarp conduits that could get them home faster only to discover that there are hostile forces claiming these conduits and if Voyager does not leave and forget these, they would destroy the ship.  Instead, Janeway tests their mettle and her ship winds up taking some damage and the crew winds up taking refuge on a planet whose people built these conduits and used them to control this part of the galaxy with an iron fist until the peoples they conquered rose up and destroyed them.  Down underneath the planet's surface, Janeway and crew find some of the survivors of that race only to find that these guys are worse than the pirates they were hiding from.  Once again, Janeway's gotta make a choice, either deal with the baddies from below or the pirates from above.  Eventually, the baddies and the pirates wind up fighting each other instead of pursuing Voyager.

For added humor, there ""Tinker, Tenor, Soldier, Spy"" where the doctor enables a dream program and a plucky bureaucrat from an alien ship tries to use these dreams to control the doctor--only to find out that what he was seeing was the doctor's dreams.  It's almost as funny as the episode where the doctor becomes a musical sensation or when he hides out in 7 of 9's cortical implants and winds up taking over her body and personality.  Sometimes he provided the necessary levity where everything else seemed grim for Voyager.

""Muse"" is also another good episode as well, as Torres and Kim are stranded on a planet when their shuttle crashes.  Torres is befriended by a playwright who basically uses her stories--the stories about Voyager--to write new plays where we see these people re-enact the journey from the time that the Caretaker removed both Voyager and the Macquis ship from the Badlands to the Delta Quadrant.

The season begain with ""Equinox"" where Voyager encounters another starfleet ship brought into the Delta Quadrant.  Once again, the crew is tempted to use what that ship is using for power to get home with, but once it is discovered that the captain of that ship is killing off a race of creatures and using their bodies for the power, this leaves Janeway and crew distressed, especially when these creatures attack Voyager with the intent to destroy it for what Equinox is doing.

Then there is ""Child's Play"" where we discover the back story behind Ichib, one of the Borg Children rescued from a failing cube.  Turns out his family genetically engineered him to infect the Collective and destroy the Borg ships from the inside.  After Janeway returns him to his family, his father sends him off again to infect another Borg ship and Janeway must rescue him again and make him a member of the Voyager crew.

Of course one must also discuss ""Pathfinder"" and the mission that both Barclay and Admiral Paris undertake to establish communications with Janeway and crew in the Delta Quadrant.  Especially now that the admiral wants to contact his son.

Overall, this season was a typical Voyager season--beginning with a cliffhanger where Voyager was facing destruction in the Delta Quadrant at the hands of someone else, only to end in another cliffhanger where Janeway and crew need to improvise again to figure out a way to survive the Delta Quadrant.",1097366400,18,3418,4.841924398625429
2160816,3,B00062IDLA,"Season six started out with so much promise as it was the sole Trek series in production(Deep Space Nine signed off last season),talented writer Ronald D. Moore joined the production crew,and the cliffhanger Equinox pt. 1 was the best since Scorpion.
 Unfortunately Moore's tenure would only last a few episodes, and after Equinox,the show would be bogged down by less than spectacular stories ( Alice, Riddles, Fair Haven, Live Fast and Prosper and the wreched Haunting of Deck Twelve), as well as stunt casting for ratings (The Rock's cameo in Tsunkatse).
 Nonetheless, season six did score some good episodes (Barge of the Dead, Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy, One Small Step, The Voyager Conspiracy,Blink of an Eye,Memorial).The season also introduced the Barclay Arc (Pathfinder, Life Line) and an appearence from Kes (Fury).
 The penultimate season may have suffered from less than inspired writing, but the fact that they were only a year closer to home makes it all worthwhile.",1095811200,5,981,5.19620253164557
2160855,5,B00062IDLA,"Just finished viewing Season 6 and ready for the next one. I enjoy the cast and some of the episodes have more than their share of comedy mixed with the drama.

2160858,4,B00062IDLA,"When Voyager originally started on television in 1995, I had been watching Deep Space Nine for 2 years.  DSN had a different story line from previous Star Trek incarnations.  I was very much into DSN and Voyager was almost unwatchable as the stories seemed so simple and not challenging at that time.  I still don't like the ""Seska and Kazon"" storyline and skip it.  Recently, Voyager was being shown on television again, and I decided to watch.  I have to say that with time, I have enjoyed Voyager and it's almost all new because I had not seen many of the episodes and tuned out the last couple of remaining seasons.  Had it not been shown again on television, I doubt I would have watched Voyager again.  I just think Paramount had too much Star Trek out there, and how can you go to the same pool of writers and get fresh ideas?  The best thing that should have happened, was wrest control from Rick Berman and Brannon Braga because they pretty much mashed Star Trek into the ground.",1495497600,,988,4.4804469273743015

2160886,4,B00062IDLA,"Another excellent season that builds solidly on themes introduced in Seasons 4 and 5 without slipping into serialization. There is still a new and unique idea/adventure in each episode, but individual characters develop more depth through excellent storytelling. In Season 6, the focus seems to be on Seven of Nine, B'Elanna, the Doctor and Captain Janeway.

My Season 6 favorites include:

Episode 3  Barge of the Dead  The eighth of my Voyager Top Ten. An exceptionally creative presentation of the Klingon afterlife and Klingon lore. This story pairs with Season 1s Faces episode as an inquiry into self-acceptance as told through BElanna Torres. This story very tenderly touches on what its like being the child of divorced parents.

Episode 8  One Small Step  An homage to early space exploration. A good episode for space geeks, not only for a good story, but also for sneaking some real space science terms into the dialog. The episode concludes with a stirring speech from Captain Janeway about how space literally means nothing, but opens the door to everything.

Episode 12  Blink of an Eye  This episode proves that its possible to tell an interesting and credible story with a time anomaly without resorting to gimmickry. A great study of a civilizations growth from Stone Age to Post-Modern Age with a little general relativity tossed in. Star Treks trademark optimism about the future is highlighted.

Episode 22  Muse  The ninth of my Voyager Top Ten. Can art influence politics? Can messages conveyed through drama and poetry make a difference in peoples lives? Well, you're a Star Trek fan  Star Trek inspires cooperation and acceptance of differences  Star Trek is a series of dramatic episodes with a message -- see where this is going?  Bonus points for the use of ancient Greek theater as a model.

The Worst of Season 6:

Episode 9  The Voyager Conspiracy - Wherein Seven of Nine joins the Alex Jones fringe. I appreciate the point that most conspiracy theories can be connected to a handful of supporting facts. However, the devolution of the story into a Keystone Cops chase scene diminishes what otherwise would have been a decent message.

Episodes 11 and 17  Fair Haven & Spirit Folk -  These episodes lose touch with science fiction and suffer for it. It is ironic that a holodeck program created to relieve crew boredom is itself, remarkably boring to the viewer. Spirit Folk also suffers badly in comparison to the similar Next Generation episode that creates a self-aware Moriarty from Datas Sherlock Holmes holodeck program.

Episode 20 - Good Shepherd - Oh please! Rudolph, Herbie and the Island of Misfit Toys do not translate to Voyager story ideas. Barf!

Episode 23  Fury - Another inexplicable application of time concepts. If the temporal mechanics in this plot were accurate, the plot itself would never exist because it would have been fixed in some earlier timeline. [SPOILER ALERT] I am also really tired of crew being killed and brought back to life through time paradoxes.",1488412800,,3017,4.974051896207585
2160887,5,B00062IDLA,I think this is the kind of programming that all TV shows and movies should be modeled by. It does not have profanity it promotes good moral values and it promotes honesty fair play and shows how there are always consequences to your actions. I sincerely hope they make many  more Seasons of Voyager because In my opinion this is the best kind of programing ever made.,1487635200,,368,4.492537313432836

2160891,5,B00062IDLA,"I was a loyal fan when Voyager was on originally; but lost touch in last two seasons due to college. Now, for the first time I am watching all the later episodes I missed by binge watching on Prime. Voyager is a great show which could have gone on and on. The ratings across seven seasons was actually quite stable around 7.7/10; which means a great many felt about the show the way I still do.

2160942,5,B00062IDLA,"I like season 6 of the Voyager the most.  It has more variety and better storylines  than the other seasons.  I think of Voyager series as a High Tech ""Lost in Space"" from the 60's.  I liked seeing Seven getting more storylines, I believe she is one of the prettiest females on any media.  Seeing her humanity evolve made the season 6 the most interesting.

My favorite episodes are #10 Pathfinder and #20 The Good Shepherd.

Pathfinder brings back Lt. Barkley, the holodeck loving engineer from the Next Generation.  This episode Barkley is in charge of a communications array.  He has a theory that if a space anomaly comes by Pathfinder, that they could send some energy beam and bounce it off this anomaly.  This would create a miniature wormhole and that they could send a  message to Voyager.  But his boss thought Barkley was too involved with the Voyager holograph crew.  Great episode.

The Good Shepherd has the Captain dealing with 3 crewmen that had fallen thru the cracks.  So she assigns them to an away mission that she will be in command of.  A genius, a professional sick person and and an ensign who has lack of confidence.  Janeway surprises me on her command expertise.  Another great episode.

Season 6 in my opinion is the best of the series.",1486166400,2,1264,4.638009049773756

2160945,5,B00062IDLA,"A fan of the series since Kirk, Spock & McCoy, I missed these in the '90s when I was without television.  Each  episode of  Voyager has been a new pearl to discover ithroughout our northern winter .  So true to the prime directive ; inspired plots even more relevant today ; opulent costumes/shapely uniforms and the power and grace of Capt. K. Janeway's dedication to negotiation and to fellowship.  These 20 yr. old episodes reflect so much of the technology we see in fact today.  Some say space travel has been with us since the middle of the last century.  Gene Roddenberry seems to have been broadly prescient so let's all take a page from this series.  Earth is a precious jewel with a diversity that is found on one in five thousand planets - located in a galactic high traffic zone.  Solidarity is the order of the day for humans from now on lest our beautiful gaia be sold 'down the river' by mercantile interests of both on and off-worlders.",1485561600,,952,4.52046783625731

The somewhat prickly character she plays is a fun counterpoint to the sometimes sappy sweet interpersonal relationships that normally abound on Voyager.  For that matter, a 70 year voyage (get it?) would require it to be a generational ship (which they have alluded to but done nothing to make it happen).  Generational life,  aging, marriages, births, divorces and all that goes with it, would require extensive preplanning that could have been of greatly entertaining.

2161276,5,B00062IDLA,Great show. I think it could be the best Star Trek series of all due to its storyline's uniqueness compared to other Star Treks. Having them stranded in the Delta Quadrant was genius and made for great storytelling. Also loved that it did a pretty good job of continuity with Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.,1477094400,,312,4.589285714285714

While I like all of the series, my overall mood, and what kind of stimulus I'm looking for at a particular time strongly influences my decision on what I'll watch, and enjoy (and ponder) at a given time. For me, Voyager was the most romantic series, whether a ""dark"" or ""comedic"" episode. Relationships were explored in depth, Tom Paris and Harry Kim had 2 delightful holodeck episodes...Fair Haven and Spirit Folk; Paris and Torres moved their marriage along to the culmination in season 7. Picardo delivered a virtuoso singing and drama performance in Tinker, Tenor...; and Torres and supporting cast in ""Muse"" made me feel like I was back in Greek history or drama class watching Aristophanes. And being a typical male, I always enjoyed watching Seven Of Nine in whatever she was involved with. I turn to this series when I want humor, relief from sadness, romance, and as in all the ST series, the theme and episode music are great. I took off a half star because there were a small number of episodes that didn't quite reach the level set by the majority.",1466208000,,1115,4.6938775510204085

2161674,4,B00062IDLA,"This season is like a diesel engine. It needed a little warming up to get going right.

After the wrap up to the two parter, it took until Episode 7 to get it right. From then on, it's golden.
One Small Step, Pathfinder, in the Blink of an Eye are some of my favorites. One Small Step I love the log of the astronaut in the capsule. When he looks out and sees the alien ships in the anomaly and makes his speech to the computer, it stirs something in me.

I like Collective as it forces Seven to take up a wider roll. Good Shepard was a better version of that first season finale. The Haunting of Deck 12 was a good episode. I watched that at Halloween and it was a good fit.",1461024000,,675,3.9925925925925925

2161730,4,B00062IDLA,"I'm a Trekkie. As a child, I watched TOS (the original series) when it first aired in the sixties. I only became a fan of Voyager a few years ago when it became available on Amazon Prime. I always thought (logically) Spock was the most interesting character television had ever developed. Voyager expands that character development to almost every member of this new crew. My only complaint is the ""Aliens take over the ship"" scenario which it has in common with TOS. That said, I have a list of episodes of Voyager that I want to revisit just like I always will with TOS, my most favorite of all television shows.
P.S., Hate to say it, but the acting and writing of Voyager is way better than TOS.",1457222400,,698,4.4609375

The Fairhaven episodes refreshing with Kathryn Janeway falling in love. The good shepherd episode is a lesson in classic leadership and redemption. Fury was an unexpected return of Kess. Of course the finale unamatrix zero was great!

I originally thought the premise to the show was depressing and bleak, but Revisiting it has changed my opinion.  The Borg episodes are particularly well written and acted--some of the best Trek episodes done to date.  I could do without the excessive number of holodeck episodes (I don't care for those in any Trek series really), but this season is full of great episodes and memorable moments.

2162035,4,B00062IDLA,"Good for the Star Trek or syfy enthusiast.
Something to be said for watching any series from the beginning to the end in sequence.  I always recommend you start with the pilot of any series.  If it grabs you, watch the next episode.  Continue watching until you lose interest.

That said, if you make it to season six, you won't need a recommendation.

I am currently in season 7 (the last season) with only a few episodes to go.

I watched this when it was on TV and enjoyed it.  Watching from the start and in sequence makes it much more enjoyable.  I often binge watch three or four episodes at a time.",1443225600,,605,4.292035398230088

The writers changed somewhere is Season 7. They didn't seem to know what they were doing. But Kate M was and continues to be always great.

Voyager is classic sci-fi. It's not the best installment of the Trek universe, but it's amazingly good science fiction.

The show has 1 obvious story arc from start to finish, about the Voyager trying to travel the full length of the galaxy to get back to Earth. But along the way they have plenty of mini adventures where the crew has to pull together despite their differences because they only have each other to rely on. That's the magic of Voyager. The main story arc is ever present but each episode is it's own story.

They face old foes like the Borg (who are everywhere) and friends like Q (because what's a Trek series without Q) and lots of new ones that they meet along the way. The individual episodes remind me of 1950's and 60's sci fi stories, only with much high production value.

Season 6 is heavy on Borg plots. The Borg Queen from Star Trek First Contact reprises her role. But one episode is one of the best sci-fi stories of all time. Voyager is in orbit around a random planet, where time moves MUCH faster on the surface than in orbit. Voyager is in orbit for just a day or two but an entire civilization develops on the ground in that time and watches Voyager in the sky. The ship becomes something of a religion on the planet, all in the blink of an eye to Voyager's crew. It's a great episode, one of the best single episodes of the entire Trek franchise.

Voyager is a fun departure from the Trek series that proceeded it. It's still ""Spacehip flying around meeting aliens"" but it's not constantly arguing with the Klingons and Romulans.

It's well worth watching for the fun ride it is.",1431561600,2,1620,4.445945945945946

""The Inner Light"" from TNG seems to tell the same story with a different angle.  But the nuances and differences are what make this stand out.  The TNG Hugo-award-winning story was about observing the demise of a planet.  ""Memorial"" is about observing a massacre of innocents from the perspective of the perpetrator.  This experience traumatizes the crew, but also teaches them an invaluable lesson.  This is why we tell stories about fictionalized pasts and imagined futures: to prepare ourselves for being the best that we can be.  Voyager is a great series because it tells us stories about how to deal with difference and otherness.  This episode stands out in this regard.  Love love love!",1424390400,,793,4.850746268656716

2162290,4,B00062IDLA,"Voyager is a well written show. Just listening to the banter between The Doctor and crew demonstrates the art of good writing. Have always been drawn to the Star Trek series, Captain Kirk, Generations, Deep Space Nine to some degree. However, Voyager is my all time favorite. Being swept 70,000 light years into the ""Delta Quadrant"" in their Intrepid Class Starship is vintage Star Trek.  In the year 2375; being threatened with assimilation by the Borg and conflicts with other species is fascinating. This all in attempts to return home to earth longing for help from Star Fleet during the 7 year voyage. Of course the Seven of Nine character added a complete new dimension. I was even more intrigued to learn recently, relationships on the studio set were not always good. Based upon a media interview Jeri Ryan did (Seven of Nine) Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway) was not thrilled to have the ""stimulating"" character Seven of Nine introduced to the show in season 4. Apparently there was attitude on set. Glad to review this show. Actually watching the full 7 year series. I'm at Season 6 Episode 8. I'm watching Voyager on Amazon Prime.

2162291,5,B00062IDLA,Every member of the cast does their job properly.  A very good show.,1424390400,,68,4.230769230769231
2162292,5,B00062IDLA,"Star Trek Voyager was the fifth incarnation of the Star Trek franchise for Television behind Star Trek, Star Trek The Next Generation, and Star Trek Deep Space Nine. It featured the first female captain in the shows and is broadly about a starship vessel (in the 24th century) being marooned on the other side of the galaxy, 75,000 light years away from home....something that they say is a 75 year trip back home (they get boosts along the way over the seasons).  The show ran for seven seasons and had 172 shows. There were no movies ever made based on this franchise.

By season 6, the second to last season, the show had found its stride. All the characters knew each other and Seven, a Borg Drone played by Jeri Ryan, was by season 6 completely  assimilated into the Voyager crew. In my opinion, season 6 broadly featured episodes that focused on giving depth to each of the characters.  Some episodes are better than others in my opinion but that's just because I preferred certain characters.

THINGS I DID NOT LIKE:
- I personally find some of the drama on the show ""manufactured"", in that it doesn't ring true or even necessary, Disagreements between the Captain and Chakotay are sometimes painful to watch.
- They don't seem to value their own rules very much. Things like the Temporal Prime Directive, Prime Directive, etc. are at first blush held in high reverence only to be entirely disregarded in the next scene. Captain Janeway would say, ""That would be a violation of the INSERT WHATEVER STARFLEET RULE HERE."" Then in a later scene, they've decided to completely ignore the rule and there are no apparent reprecussions.
- Sometimes the characters are just whiny
- They seem to pull rank quite a bit and disagree over obvious courses of action. They're supposed to be in a more enlightened society but they behave like a military organization that, at times, disregards valuable ideas while, at other times, they can't seem to agree on the blatantly obvious course of action standing in front of them.
- Seven, Jeri Ryan, was still too wooden.  You'd think that by now she could be regaining a bit more of her humanity. It really also wasn't necessary in my mind to still pour that poor woman into that girdle and wire laden leotard.  Sure she was stunningly beautiful in the garb but its a bit gratuitous and while it was likely flattering to the actress it was also probably somewhat uncomfortable to be continuously poured into that outfit. Beyond her attire, Jeri Ryan is a wonderful and talented actress with a wide dynamic range and it was sad to me that her full talents were not used more (in Unimatrix Zero, the last episode of the season we start to see a bit more of her talents but we only get glimpses. I felt that was a missed opportunity.
- To be fair, poor Roxanne Dawson had to wear the Klingon crest every week so she wasn't without suffering either (this is not a dislike of the show, I just didn't want it to come across that only Jeri Ryan had to be molded into an alien....I guess Neelix had it the worst if we want to be totally fair).
- I thought the season focused too much on each character vs a broader plotline which I tend to favor but that's just me. It was ok and entertaining.
- When unknown aliens who refuse to talk to you are shooting at you, it's not logical to try to talk them down. I never understood this in the Star Trek the Next Generation shows.
- I had a lot of issues with tiny ships without any significantly advanced technology being able to almost bring Voyager's defenses to its knees (Shields down to 27 percent captain....really?  Well, hey anything to advance the plot.)

THINGS I LIKE
- I like the fact that they crew is familiar and almost like family towards one another. I felt comfortable watching the episodes.
- It's an interesting concept....marooned on the other side of the galaxy (at least by now they had gotten rid of the feather headed people....that was painful to watch the first time around)
- By this season Janeway had stopped walking with her hands behind her back....thank goodness for small things.  It just looked odd for a petite lady like Janeway to strut around with her hands behind her back like some stoic 350lb sea captain.  I couldn't help but laugh when they made her walk that way.
- The Doctor was shining as a leading persona of the show by some of these later seasons, perhaps too much. Robert Picardo had a very strong on screen presence and he stole every scene were he was present which was good in some ways but not so good in others.  Also, his flirting with Seven was painful to watch but enjoyable in a fingernails on the chalkboard kind of way.
- I loved that Dwight Shultz was being injected into the show. He's another wonderfully talented actor who stole all the scenes he appeared in.

By this time in the series, I had the feeling that the show was about as good as it was going to get.  Mind you, a lot of people hated Voyager so that might not be saying much.  I personally found the production values sound and the theme was consistent with the Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine Universe.  I must say that it does have a much more innocent feel than shows that came later like the unrelated Battlestar Galactica remake.  It was a different style of filming and telling a story.  I tend to enjoy it but it is a love it or hate it affair for many.

We have to be fair, though, this show is fifteen years old now.  It wasn't even show was still in 4/3 aspect ratio so no widescreen support. Overall, it's a fun romp for me but it is a very dated show from a more innocent era of Star Trek. It did win 7 Emmys and a bunch of other awards, mostly for visual effects, music, etc.  Although, I don't think Season 6 won any big awards.

It would be nice if they came up with a more updated series for Star Trek but I hope they don't go too dark like Battlestar Galactica did.  Star Trek needs to be ideological in some respects (to me at least).

Reruns of Voyager are admittedly a guilty pleasure for me but shhh don't tell anyone.",1424390400,,6060,4.4485559566787005

2162310,5,B00062IDLA,"Season 6 continues the saga of the Voyager crew.  This season they liberate a group of child Borg, which allows 7 of 9 more screen time, all good for 7 fans (which I am).  Some really great episodes in this season.  The Holographic Doctor as a spy is one of the most humorous episodes in the franchise, along with the episode 21, which features the crew being impersonated by aliens (think comic convention impersonations), two of my favorite episodes for humor.  The Haunting of Deck 12 gives a different dimension to the franchise and is unique from the other Star Treks.  Season 6 has some of my favorite episodes.  ST-V is my favorite next to ST-TOS.  Female captain check, strong female characters check, well written storylines check.  The only negative is the same I have with the entire ST franchise.  There really needs to be more alien variation.  I hope that ST comes back again in this new world of easier to do CGI and really blasts us with fantastical aliens.",1418515200,,973,4.637426900584796
2162311,5,B00062IDLA,"This season is tied with Five as the best of ""Voyager."" Great stories, great character development, great aliens, great guest stars. Just like with Season 5, 6 seems to not only have a very good budget, but the writers seem to have been more daring here--more willing to put forth aliens, characters, and episodes that were, well, *weird.*

Yes, Season 6 gets a tad surreal at times, with Seven of Nine kick-boxing the Rock (seriously), B'Elanna's soul venturing into Klingon Hell, a sentient starship stalking Tom Paris, and super-intelligent space-munchkins obsessing over the Doctor's singing (okay, this season wasn't *perfect*).

Does the story continue? Oh yes. In season 6, Reg Barclay invents the ""Pathfinder,"" allowing Voyager to get in regular contact with Starfleet, and allowing Reg to join the show's recurring cast; Seven adopts four Borg brats, one of whom is actually lovable (but sadly, one of the boring ones winds up staying for the rest of the series); B'Elanna finally accepts her Klingon heritage, the Doctor meets his creator in person; and we finally get some hints to what Kes has been up to (though not in the most satisfactory way).

Also like Season 5, there are tons of memorable guest characters. The corrupt Equinox crew (""Equinox""); resurrected redshirt Lindsay Ballard (""Ashes to Ashes""); three drones from Seven's old unit (""Survival Instinct""); misfit lower-decks crewman Tal Celes and Billy Telfer (""Good Shephard""); a lovesick Irish hologram (""Fair Haven""), and a sinister shuttle craft taking the form of Tom's college crush (""Alice"").

The regular cast is well-treated in this season. B'Elanna has a Klingon awakening in ""Barge of the Dead"" that stays with, all the way to ""Unimatrix Zero,"" when she turns a dead phaser rifle into a makeshift bat'leth. Chakotay is at his best, neither shoved to the sidelines like in some seasons, nor acting like a stoned Indian stereotype like in Season 2.  Seven, now fairly comfortable in her life aboard Voyager, must face her past, as she adopts the Borgletts and reunites with old acquaintances.  And of course there's the Doctor, stealing the show as usual, never more than in ""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy.""

Down sides?

The episode ""Fury,"" while very entertaining, was a missed opportunity for a fantastic two-parter (in my opinion). Kes fans hate this episode for ""ruining her character,"" but if you got as sick of her beauty, kindness, powers, and overall speshulness as I did, you may enjoy seen an old, bitter Kes hell-bent on revenge. The only problem is that we never got a backstory for that bitter old Kes. We didn't need anything epic; one or two flashbacks, a short monologue, or even some subtle hints and what happened to her, would have done the trick.

Aside from that, the Borg kids can get tedious at times; there's one horrible rubber-forehead-aliens episode (""Muse""); and the episode with the space-munchkins (""Virtuoso"") felt more like a ""Hay Arnold!"" episode than something that belonged on ""Star Trek.""

Overall though, a damn, damn good season.",1418169600,,3048,5.078

 Pathfinder - Mr. Broccoli .. oops, Barkley is a little more neurotic than I remember, and Troy is getting old. Mix that with the Dr. and his dad, and you get annoying characters but good episodes. Almost lost the Dr. again, no such luck.

 Dragons Teeth  Janeway goes from benevolent to the exterminator.
 Ashes to Ashes  disappointed Ensign Lyndsey Ballard doesnt get to remain as crew, Harry realy needs a girlfriend.
 Fury - Super Kes episode is memorable, shes not the tiny little girl anymore (diet).

I think this could be the greatest series of all time.

2162457,5,B00062IDLA,"I have long been a Trekkie. I have watched all the Star Trek series multiple times. As far as the newer shows go (Everything TNG & after) I find this one to be the best. No longer bound by off the wall missions assigned by some mysterious Starfleet admiral, Captain Janeway has one goal, Get her people home. Of course a straight course would be boring and they do have to take on supplies now and then. Therefore, our crew interacts with this uncharted area. I like the whole Borg storyline. Here it is humans that are the invaders (and often the aggressors). We get to see more in depth background of the Borg. We also get to be introduced to new aliens and new cultures not previously seen in the other series.
In the other series it always seem like help was just a phone call away, not with the USS Voyager. This crew is on its own. Its a survival situation which adds a layer of complication to every choice.
The roles are well  played by all of the actors / actresses. Like any series the first season is a little rough. The people behind the roles had to grow together which soon translated to a well defined and entertaining show. Season 6 and 7 are my favorites though I still go back and watch the others from time to time. Its hard to believe its been 20 years since this show was on. I rarely saw it when it was still on TV, but have more than made up for it since. If you like Star Trek, you'll love Voyager.",1401235200,,1422,4.208791208791209

2162496,5,B00062IDLA,"Season 6 has a foundation of years and years of Voyager episodes and Star Trek itself like TOS. This season is interesting because of interesting connections between storylines. Voyager has several stars, and each episode highlights a character or two or even the crew. The season begins with the second part of Equinox, and eventually plays two of my favorites, ""Blink of an Eye and Virtuoso."" The interesting thing is that some of the overlooked episodes become interesting after time. For example, ""Muse"" is a favorite of mine. Yet, I could now appreciate again casting and the number three a little more with ""Live fast and Prosper"" and ""Good Shepherd."" A really good review would include my thoughts for each episode and the interesting connections I spoke of, but then some people have not seen season 6 for the first time. So, I will end it here as a Trekkie from the old school. 3.14159 . . . versine . . . you must see the duet!",1396656000,,937,4.616766467065868

Pro's
-Gets back to the, ""Boldly go"" mantra of older star treck (being halfway across the galaxy helps)
-The Borg! One of the best space enemies of all times, calculating yet very creepy.
-Excellent character development through out the series.

Con's
-Not many, every once in a while a line or two feels forces, mainly from Harry Kim
-Some of the stories are ""fillers"" that do not push the main arch along, these do develop a part of one of the characters

Worth your time, since this was one of the later Star Treks the special effects are more developed.",1393113600,,680,4.424

I can imagine being a member of the intrepid Voyager crew, battling aliens, ion storms, and sheer boredom just trying to get home.

With lots of action, lots of aliens, and lots of the best discovery of all, self discovery, this series has something for everyone. Will Seven of Nine finally embrace her humanity?

2162645,4,B00062IDLA,"Of all the Star Trek series, Voyager is my favorite. I watched voyager when it originally aired in the 90s. What I saw then and that I appreciate even more now was that voyager had strong female characters.  They had their flaws, but they were not afraid to stand in their own strength. Captain Janeway a leader of men and women, who was not afraid of letting others find their strength. She was able to,at time, be vulnerable, without doubting that she wais the leader of this crew.  Lt. Torres, grappling  with the issue of being multi-racial ( multi-species), and she was a brilliant engineer. Seven of Nine, a social outsider, who used her intellence, and knowledge to become an essential member of the crew. Three strong women in their own right, who were able to have personal struggles and still performed in their professions flawlessly.  I would recommend that you watch the whole series to appreciate the subtle ways that these character developed individually and collectively.  Season 6 does not disappoint.",1376092800,,1019,4.901162790697675

2162652,2,B00062IDLA,"Voyager is my favorite of the various Trek series.  So why is this season so much lower than the others, in a series I really like?  Well, first of all, there's Barclay, who becomes instrumental in trying to get Voyager home sooner - and yes, it's the same old stuttering, neurotic Barclay.  They could NOT have picked a worse character to bring back and give some continuity with the earlier series.  Even Wesley Crusher - the ever-hated Wesley - would have been a better choice than the simpering, completely annoying Barclay.  But there's more bad:  two episodes are devoted to the holographic town of Fair Haven, and both episodes are incredibly boring.  Then there are the ""arts"" episodes - the Doctor becomes a singing star on one planet, while B'Elanna is a playwright's muse on another (the episode is filled with the most awful pseudo-Greek tragedy I've ever encountered: it's completely painful); the former may work for a single viewing, but it's not one you'll want to watch again.  And speaking of B'Elanna, this season also has the improbable ""Barge of the Dead"", in which our chief engineer finds herself on her way to the Klingon afterlife.  Finally, there's the ""Arena"" clone, ""Tsunkatse"", in which Seven becomes the Kirk-figure; at least it has the redeeming factors of The Rock and Jeffrey Combs, but they're both fairly wasted (especially The Rock, who does little but grunt and fight).  That's just too many bad episodes.  And the 'return of Kes' episode, ""Fury"", is only a tiny bit better, and completely illogical.  True there are some good episodes too:  notably ""The Voyager Conspiracy"", ""Live Fast and Prosper"", the horrifying ""Child's Play"", the suspenseful ""Haunting of Deck Twelve"", and the season-ending ""Unimatrix Zero"" (although the Borg are becoming a bit tedious, and there's a touch too much of the superb ""Best of Both Worlds"" in it).

Others seem to like this season, so I may be in a minority here, but every other season of Voyager is more consistent, and has fewer clunkers, than this one.",1375056000,,2029,4.894736842105263

2162690,5,B00062IDLA,"Voyager was better then ever this season. This season started with a bang as the 2nd of a two part storyline regarding a federation crew who murdered aliens in order to speed their way home concluded. Captain Janeway's determination to end their deprivations bordered on obsession. Te rest of the season built well upon that strong first episode. The Doctor's character was further developed with several strong plot-lines for him. Seven of Nine was challenged a great deal this season as there are several Borg-centric episodes including new Borg characters [Borg children!] and a Borg season finale. As both the doctor and Seven are among my favorite Star Trek characters, I  enjoyed this season a great deal.",1366934400,,711,5.076923076923077

I have always enjoyed Star Trek's TV shows, some of the movies I could have done without but...As with all Star Trek shows you can't be too critical of the implausibility of the story line because to imagine being in a time when people can live their lives in these giant Star Ships it totally implausible and absurd, that is a part of the beauty of these shows.",1366243200,,597,4.387387387387387

Kes returns and Starfleet finds a way to communicate with Voyager are some of the highlights that help Season 6 not be a total disappointment.  My favorite episodes are as follows, Pathfinder, Riddles, Blink of an Eye and Fury.  Fury is the episode where Kes returns with revenge as her motive.  I think the writers could have come up with a better reason for Kes to return.  it didn't suit her character to want revenge, since there was no reason for her to be angry with the crew of Voyager in the first place.  I look forward to purchasing the only season left to complete my collection, which is Season one.

2162795,2,B00062IDLA,"It has been said by multiple `Star Trek' fans that `Voyager' was a prime culprit of shredding the Borg of any kind of threat. When they first burst onto the `Star Trek' universe (in the `TNG' episode `Q Who?') they were otherworldly, malevolent, and near unstoppable. Kill or be killed was the order of business whenever they showed up and it's made for some heart-pounding heroism by many Federation crews.

Like any popular hit song though, the more you hear it, the less resonance it has. `Unimatrix Zero' is the proverbial chisel that strips the Borg of whatever evil might they once had.

The crux of this two-part season final is that there is a chance for Janeway and crew to spark a resistance from inside the Collective. She then sets in motion a plan that involves Tuvok, Torres, and herself getting assimilated, so as to introduce a virus that will allow everyone in Unimatrix Zero to retain their individuality after regenerating.

So...assimilation. A horrifying violation of an individual's mind, body and soul by the Borg. A process that we have been told over and over again is almost a fate worse then death is fundamentally muted. Sure, they retain their individuality through a random potion thought up by the Doc (which is another negation of what was once thought inexorable), but what about the ghastly body mutilations? I guess having a half a toaster shoved into your eyeball ain't no thang to the Voyager crew.

The assimilation of Janeway is supposed to be a final, chilling cliffhanger for the show, but instead comes off as confusing with no weight to it. Assimilation is something you want to avoid at all costs, so much so that death is a better course. But hey! We can simply reverse that now and get those irritating Borg implants right out of you at no extra cost!

Positive Points:

- Janeway always seem to be at her heroic best when fighting the Borg. Maybe it's how the Borg Queen almost curses her name whenever she finds out Janeway is messing about with the Collective.

- Some aspects of Seven of Nine having a history in Unimatrix Zero are cool. Annika has apparently been kicking it as a human adult for sometime.

- Harry Kim asking when he'll get promoted and everyone pretty much ignoring him.

Negative Points:

- The Borg Queen and severed Borg heads. A desperate attempt to make her twice as evil, but it just makes her (and the Collective) look incompetent.

- The cobbled together feel of the episode. Unimatrix Zero (the place, not the episode) doesn't make much sense.

- The crew not bothered enough by Janeway's plan to get assimilated. Chakotay used to put up a better fight then this to Janeway's hair brain schemes.",1349740800,,2673,4.71244635193133
2162796,4,B00062IDLA,"So, okay. Among other episodes this season, this one is a little weak. The plot is kind of shallow, and it feels a bit like it's just filling the slot. But I didn't think it was that bad, either. This features B'Elanna, of course, but she actually takes a back seat here for once. I think it's kind of refreshing to see her play the mature ""look I know what I'm doing but throw me a bone and I will help you"" sort of persona, rather than ""arrrghh I am all aggro and I will bite your face off"" like we saw in earlier seasons. Besides, it really isn't about B'Elanna this time, it's about the host society and how they deal with their problems. I thought the idea was okay, too -- in a Greco-Roman type of civilization, a playwright in need of material to appease his patron discovers Voyager's logs and uses them to write a play. They didn't really go far enough -- only so much you can do in an hour -- but, if you use your imagination, it's kind of intriguing. I wouldn't be scared off by this episode.

2162813,4,B00062IDLA,"The Seven of Nine and Doctor episodes during Season 6 are some of the finest of the series. However, Voyager continued with its trend of abandoning the rest of the crew to boring episodes and haphazard characterization. One exception was an exceptional B'elanna episode ""The Muse"".

Unfortunately, this season was also marred by a few duds, including the introduction of the Fair Haven holodeck program, featuring a small town of sentient holograms. Even worse, Captain Janeway falls in love with one - completely out of character. There's also some silliness with the crew adopting a bunch of Borg children.

Where I really get frustrated is when the writers develop a really interesting moral quandary, but then find a quick and easy solution. There were definitely a few times this season when I thought Janeway took the moral high ground a bit too quickly. Too often, the writers seem reluctant to show the crew struggling with the moral implications of their decisions, ending episodes with a battle or action scene rather than a deep insight.

Overall, there are quite a few missteps, but some gems worth watching.",1347062400,,1120,5.010752688172043

She had been out of the business for over 2 years and she wasn't comfortable with the character anymore, too. This, along with a poorly written script, made for high hopes being dashed upon the rocks. Even with all of that, the story could have been saved with a nice ending, say Janeway and Neelix hugging Kes in the transporter room. They didn't even say goodbye! Huh? Sure, Neelix was sad to see her in such tough shape but that had to be all Ethan Phillips and not the script.

I think the sole reason this episode got a 4 instead of a 3 from me is directly attributed to the above par cinematography (lots of fresh angles, and the opening sequence one-take from outside to inside the ship) It symbolized the chain of command from TOP to the very BOTTOM, a nice touch.

My only problem with this episode is how predictable it was...After I knew each crewman's ""obvious flaw"" and that Janeway was forcing them on an away mission WE ALL KNOW how it's going to end. They'd have a really close call with some space anomaly, they'd all learn to get past their fears, they'd all survive the ordeal, and Janeway would accomplish her goal.

Another thing I wanted to note was the fight choreography and execution was impressive, especially for Star Trek standards. I don't know if Jeri Ryan had some martial arts training before (she has played Sonya from Mortal Kombat), but I'm pretty sure that was her in most scenes and she looked skilled.

Take notes kids THAT is acting.

Aside from moments like that and the one's with Tom and Harry, this was one of the more moving and thoughtful episodes. It's a shame the side plots with the station traffic on Voyager were so uninteresting and shallow compared to the superb main story with Seven and the rest of the nine. If you were to edit out those dumb moment this would easily be a 5/5 and a classic.",1342656000,,452,4.244186046511628
2162853,4,B00062IDLA,"You know the writing is good when you want to personally curbstomp the antagonists, then take their faces to a grinder and let all those good people they've endangered take a crowbar to their kneecaps. The other reviewer is correct in that this is quite a common literary story archetype the ""Good turned Evil""; but they do it so well here, it makes you feel. These humans are worse than the Borg, worse than the Kazon, even worse than the Founders, because they were once cut from the same moral cloth. They have fallen so far, but they feel righteous in how they act now. And Janeway's deviation makes sense, most people who watch this will empathize with her actions and some may even feel she was too lenient.

  I really enjoyed this 2-parter and the conclusion was great. Although in my sick a twisted idea of closure and penance I'd prefer to treat their crew in the same fashion I begun this review. Or maybe turn on a Holodeck and have it simulate ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" on all of them *safeties off*",1342656000,,1013,4.464864864864865

Forward's Dragon's Egg, which was an excellent treatment of this subject: High gravity planet with extremely fast rotational period which means the surface population is living at a rate of 1-1.5 days per second on the Voyager.  The Voyager was a brightly visible object in their sky day and night that spurred the locals rate of technological advancement.

Biggest flaw is that instead of it ""being a while"" until the locals could ""join"" the rest of the galaxy at their time rate, it actually would have been a relatively short period since the planet was experiencing 6-10 years for every hour in the galaxy's ""real time"" which would mean 150 to 200 or so years per day.  In a month the inhabitants would have had a civilization older than the Federation's.  In a year, there is no telling how far they would have advanced.

Even if they aren't interested in the children, the idea that the Borg would simply abandon the cube seems absurd.  They would at the very least cause it to self destruct to eradicate the virus and prevent ""inferior"" species from accessing their technology.  Also, what happened to the cube at the end?  Would Captain Janeway really just leave it there when they could probably salvage all sorts of technology from it?  Hint:  transwarp coil.

2162884,5,B00062IDLA,"After some weak character moments in season five, season six brings excellence and heart back to Voyager.  Ron Moore's contributions at the beginning of the season usher in episodes that are Star Trek at its best.  The scene is being set for Voyager's return, and this season exemplified the wonders of the imagination that Leonardo spoke of to Janeway at the end of season three.  There is a nice variety, and the inclusion of the Borg children doesn't take away the validity of the storyline as another reviewer suggests--that the plotline makes the season a Lost in Space folly--it isn't.  The characters arcs are strong and the writing wonderful.  One Small Step, an investigation of the human need to explore, has Seven of Nine as the skeptic to the human factor of exploration and Janeway her mentor as she makes emotional contact with Earth's past and as a result enhances her own humanity.  Pathfinder brings back Barclay with the added pleasure of Troi as his friend and sounding board in an exploration of how the imagination at its most doubted and unconventional can be a magical, problem-solving tool.  This season rocks.  I love all of the seasons, but after some stinkers and lazy writing in season five season six brings us Star Trek at its best.",1321315200,,1262,4.810185185185185

Voyager finally starts to have fairly regular contact with StarFleet, namely starting in the episode ""Pathfinder"" as we see that getting home to Earth is more and more a reality all the time.  Kes returns for an episode ""Fury"" which actually is awesome, despite my not caring for Kes.  There aren't many standout episodes in Season 6, most of them are just passable.  The finale half Unimatrix Zero is brilliantly done, and a couple of gems in Season 6 include ""Blink of an Eye,"" ""Riddles,"" and ""Dragon's Teeth.""

2162909,5,B00062IDLA,"Star Trek: Voyager is a sort of whipping boy among Star Trek fans. (At least it was until the much beleagered and underappreciated Star Trek: Enterprise came along). Granted, even the creators of the series admitted the plot flaw of the entire series--""Why didn't the crew of Voyager simply set a course for the Alpha Quadrant and put themselves in suspended animation until they got back?""

Given this, the series has been uneven up to this point. But the series sixth season may very well be the one where the series fires on all thrusters.

It begins with a satisfying conclusion to the fifth season cliff hanger and continues by showing the relationships between the characters (a hallmark of the original Star Trek series) growing deeper and more nuanced as the series progresses. It continues to humanize Captain Kathryn Janeway helping her take her rightful place among the Captains of the other Star Trek series. Janeway is no Kirk or Picard, and she doesn't have to be. In the past she seemed rather cold and aloof, but by the time  the sixth season came along I grew to appreciate her and even like her.

Humor, which has always been a part of Star Trek, is used to great effect in this season especially in the character of the Doctor. He may be just an Emergency Medical Hologram, but he's the best thing to happen to a starship sickbay since Dr. McCoy.

In the past I only tolerated Voyager (I even liked Enterprise better than Voyager--I can't understand why so many fans rejected what is, in my opinion, the show that best captures the spirit of the original series, but that's another story). But with the sixth season I became a fan of Voyager.",1264809600,2,1661,4.6552901023890785

In any event, I'm seeing these shows now, and the ones that make up season six are particularly good.  The season is ripe with solid, character-based adventures, ambitious effects, and even a generous look at the larger Star Trek universe beyond the isolated Delta Quadrant.  Without diluting the integrity of the show's premise, we get to see fan favorite characters like The Next Generation's Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Dwight Schultz (Reginald Barclay).  It's clever how the program pulls off these guest appearances while solidly keeping Voyager stranded light years away across the galaxy, but you'll have to watch the actual shows to see how it's done.  As always, generous extra features provide a nice cap to this entertaining batch of episodes.

2162917,4,B00062IDLA,"Though my favorite Trek will always be Deep Space Nine, followed by The Next Generation, I give Voyager a lot of credit for growing as a series. When it first started, I found it to be dreadful. It was only after the addition of Seven of Nine that the show became more focused, and the cast really started to gel. By the end of the series' run, I found it a very respectable show and an important part of the Star Trek universe.

Still, while the general quality of the episodes ranged from average to good, Voyager turned in two of the very best Star Trek episodes ever produced. The first is ""Latent Image"" in season 5, in which the very nature of the Doctor's sentience is debated. It's one of the finest hours of television I've ever seen, and in itself justifies the existence of Voyager. The other is the episode ""Pathfinder,"" found here in season 6. Dwight Schultz reprises his TNG role as Reginald Barclay, he of awkward social skills, many phobias, and holosuite addiction. The episode focuses on Barclay's determination to establish communication with Voyager, a ship that, like himself, is far removed from comfort and ""home."" Whereas Barclay was an interesting character on TNG, here he is even more vital and emotionally moving as he struggles to aid the lost Voyager, and in so doing find a place for himself and a connection to other people. Even the minor characters shine in this episode - I could go on and on, but really you've just got to see it and experience it for yourself. (And stick around for the half-dozen or so episodes that follow it, as they do keep the ball rolling rather well, with some very well-crafted plots and intriguing premises.)

Voyager's final three seasons really were terrific, and ""Pathfinder"" represents the show at its best. I'd expect any Star Trek fan would be very happy to have this episode, and this stand-out season, as part of his or her collection.",1219363200,,1906,4.652818991097923

2162919,3,B00062IDLA,"All in all I found Season Six to be a disappointment following the previous two excellent seasons.  On the upside they continued to infuse the show with serial elements.  On the downside there were simply too many flat or uninteresting episodes.  In general, the problem with the season is that the writing lost some of its edge.

For fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this season is interesting for the very, very brief involvement in the show by Ron Moore, who is created with having written the first two stories of the season.  Moore was, of course, a wunderkind who had joined ST:TNG at an absurdly young age and quickly became one of the most important writers on ST:TNG and ST:DS9.  He also wrote the script for two of the ST movies (GENERATIONS and FIRST CONTACT), so his joining VOYAGER as one of the show's primary muses made sense.  But Moore's vision conflicted with those already entrenched.  For instance, he was bothered by the endless number of shuttles and felt that in a long journey across space Voyager should show more wear and tear and shortages of materiel, including shuttles.  So after only two episodes he dropped out of the show.  His next significant gig would be on ROSWELL (which had some major tie ins with the STAR TREK franchise, with Jonathan Frakes as one of the executive producers) and after that CARNIVALE.  In his next project after CARNIVALE he would get his wish to depict a starship struggling with ongoing deprivation in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which in many ways could be construed as the anti-VOYAGER.  Almost everything in BSG is the opposite of VOYAGER.  It features projectile weapons instead of beam weapons.  There are no ""shields"" and therefore you'll never hear Gaeta or Tigh or Helo say something along the lines of ""Shields down to 64%.""  It has no aliens nor even different versions of humanoid species (leaving aside the Cylons).  The political decisions are not idealistic (though arguably a far more politically liberal show than Voyager) but more akin to real politik, with expediency often trumping ideals or prime directives.  Leaders are vastly more fallible on BSG than on VOYAGER.  And BSG never, ever engages in the technobable that dominates every episode of VOYAGER.  On almost every point, the two shows are opposites.  You can tell this simply by looking at the ships, Voyager always pretty and pristine and Galactica looking worse for wear in every episode.

While increasingly unhappy with aspects of VOYAGER, there was still much in Season Six that I still found to enjoy.  The Doctor became a more and more important character on the show.  He, along with Seven of Nine, was my favorite character on the series.  Although I often complain about many aspects of the ST franchise, the one area they often excelled at was developing characters that did extraordinary jobs of helping astute viewers explores issues surrounding what can count for personhood.  The series clearly aligns itself with writers like Ray Kurzweil who believe in the almost limitless capacity for computers to gain something akin to geniune intelligence.  At this point in the run of the series I generally found that two-thirds of the episodes that I enjoyed focused either on the Doctor or on Seven.

Again, not as good a season as the previous two, but still much better than the first three seasons of the show, which simply were not very interesting and generally failed to approach any potential the show had.  Not great, but definitely worth watching for fans of previous seasons.",1202860800,4,3525,4.918781725888325

See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a fair market price of $25-35. So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range. So, $60 is your sweet spot.

Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...

Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...

The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 6) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Equinox"" in which the crew of the Voyager is charged with devising a solution to rescue Capt. Janeway and Seven Of Nine before it's too late... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""The Voyager Conspiracy"" in which a malfunctioning Seven Of Nine starts spouting rumors of mutiny when the Voyager encounters an alien race in possession of warp technology capable of bringing the Voyager back home, and ""Good Shepard"" in which Capt. Janeway takes three of her crew members on a special training mission that goes awry when a collision with a comet threatens their very lives...

2162925,1,B00062IDLA,"I own and cherish every other season of Voyager, except for this season. I literally found myself bored and nauseated by the writing, the characters, the clichs, and the pointless introduction of the ""Borg Children"" which made no sense dramatically and when the much improved Season 7 rolled around, they quickly jettisoned them. There were 2 great episodes (one being Voyager Conspiracy and Unimatrix Zero) but out of 24, not great odds. Adding to this the horrible return of the beloved Kes, this season they had a different producer at the helm and lack of writer Brannon Braga, and MY GOD does it show.",1113264000,3,606,4.836538461538462
2162926,3,B00062IDLA,"I think think may this may be the weakest season of this series. It does have it's moments. It starts with the conclusion to Equinox...another star fleet ship lost in the delta quadrant. It has violated many starfleet rules along the way especially killing beings that they were introduced to for their anti-matter. Equinox is really good. I never even did watch the the two series which spirit folk in the on the hollow deck because I just couldn't get interested in it. Still watch season six but it's not my favorite season, however.",1112054400,2,536,4.712765957446808

2162929,5,B00062IDLA,"Boy, Season 5 of Star Trek: Voyager was good.  Season 6 does not disappoint either.  More great stories and great writing and great acting.  This season dives even deeper into the personalies of the characters and lets us know their beliefs and limits.  This season has a direct link to The Next Generation with Reginald Barlay (again portrayed by Dwight Schultz) in the episode ""Pathfinder"".  Tom Paris has a love affair with a ship...no...not the Delta Flyer.  We get an inside look at a possible timeline of Earth's future in ""One Small Step"" and ""The Rock"" guest stars in ""Tsunkatse"".  Also, is the creation of Fair Haven...a holodeck recreation program.  Janeway finds some lost crew members (Zoe MacLellan guest stars).  Neelix tells a ghost story, and Seven relives a relationship she found while in the Collective in ""Unimatrix Zero"".  Kes returns.  Oh heck...there's too much to write in a review.  Just go get the season!  Another great season.  A must own for any Star Trek fan.

2162930,5,B00062IDLA,"Voyager remains the best series ever produeced as a star trek title. Perhaps it is a personal taste, but I can't help but be drawn the the tales of the lost crew. Each of the crew seem to possess a unique passion, and by god the passions are very noble ones. The captain's obsessiveness of the caring of her crew, chakotay's unwieldly humor, tom paris's passion for flight and science fiction, the dotor's fine appreciation for music. Many parts of the episodes seem to echo a similiar passion in my own heart, and I can't help but smile profounddly as I watch the series.

Season six, like five , have some of the best episodes, intertwined with some less interesting, but nevertheless worthwhile ones.  The doctor has a few debuts as an opera star in 2 episodes and you can listen to him sing like a pro, ""the blink of an eye"" tells of a planet where an entire civilization evovles from stone age to primitive space ships right in front of your eyes, (especially good if you're an Civilizations fan). Tom paris's ""Alice"" is a space ship that talks and falls in love with you, and you with her, it makes you want to grab hold of a joystick and play one of your favorite fight simulation games right after you've seen the sexy space shuttle.

2162932,3,B00062IDLA,"In the fall of 1999, for the first time in seven years, there was only going to be one Trek on. With Deep Space Nine sent off to syndicated rerun heaven, Voyager now had a chance to improve itself for its sixth season. Ronald D. Moore, who made the Klingons one of the most popular characters, was brought on board to help. However, his tenure was short-lived. He departed only a few weeks before production started on the sixth season though he did write Survival Instinct and helped pen Barge of the Dead (a Klingon story that showed why he was so good at using them). Again, the first half of the season was a mix bag of bad and semi good, with Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy, Dragon's Teeth, Blink of an Eye, and Memorial coming in on the semi good side. Pathfinder, featuring the return of both Barclay and Deanna Troi continued Voyagers foreshadowing that it the crew would eventually return home. But then there was Alice (the Stephen King inspired story), Riddles, and One Small Step (which appeared to be setting some grounds for Enterprise, for at this time there was speculation that the new series would be set before TOS). The second half featured some of the silliest and lamest episodes yet, including two trips into Tom's latest holodeck creation Fair Haven (what does Trek have against Irish people? This is not the first series to make them look like superstitious buffoons). Two whole hours wasted. These two stories alone proved that Voyager was sinking like a rock. Speaking of rocks, in another attempt getting ratings gold, wrestling superstar The Rock was brought onboard in Tsunkatse, an episode inspired by the controversial motion picture Fight Club (many other TV series did story lines like the Brad Pitt movie). It also featured two semi-regulars from DS9, the always-oily Jeffrey Combs and J.G. Hertzler. It was just too silly -and not even in the most escapist sort of way. There is an old saying Hollywood, everyone has heard it. Don't act with kids or animals. In some odd attempt at creating a story arc, plus get those ratings up, the Borg returned again in Collective. This time, a cube has been so damaged; the Collective has abandoned it, leaving a handful of children in charge. Bad acting children in charge, I might add. They would be the focus of at least three episodes, all of which were sub-par. The rest of the season was a wash, including the boring Muse (Shakespeare in Love?), Good Shepherd, (VOY's version of much better TNG episode Lower Decks) Live Fast and Prosper (a group of conmen who have stolen Voyager's identity. Was it supposed to be funny or serious? Either way, it didn't work) and Life Line (the Doctor is transmitted to the Alpha Quadrant again to help his creator, who is dying).  However, one of the most confusing shows, outside of some its time travel episodes, was Fury. It featured the return of Kes, who appeared to have had bad experiences since she changed forms nearly 4 years earlier. The show itself made no sense, and it even confused the cast (especially Robert Beltran, who went off like a rocket). Most were unsure why Jennifer Lien would return in such an unappealing way, and in such a horribly written episode to boot. One fan at TrekWeb, in an interview with producer/writer Bryan Fuller said the (episode had) ""weak plot and silly contradictions like Kes's shuttle, where did she get it?"" Fuller responded by saying: ""We figured that if Kes had advanced telepathic abilities she would have no trouble stealing a shuttle from a hapless passer-by."" Fuller continued, ""I agree with you on that one being a disappointment. We originally conceived of the show as a contemporary piece with real dramas with the crew seeing their old friend come back and having to deal with her bitterness, but somewhere along the line it became a time-travel episode. I think that was a mistake. It would have been more satisfying to see her interactions raising real issues as opposed to her skulking around the ship looking devious."" The season ends with the return of the Borg, who are no longer the menace they once were, as Braga has used them like tissue paper. Again, like the previous season's final episode, Unimatrix One cliffhanger was anticlimactic. Fairly large white arrows pointed to a conclusion that even a child could figure out. So, there was no anticipation for the conclusion, because they (the production team) already gave you one (and there might be a point at which one could say TNG's Best of Both Worlds was any series best cliffhanger). On the good side, though, he was leaving the day to day work to others, for he and Rick Berman were off to develop the new Trek series now scheduled to bow in the fall of 2001.",1100908800,12,4702,4.727161997563947
2162933,4,B00062IDLA,"Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.

Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.

The primary cast members of the sixth season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Ensign Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's sixth season begins with the episode ""Equinox, Part 2"".  In this continuation of the fifth-season cliff-hanger final episode, Capt. Janeway finds a way to protect Voyager from the attacks of nucleogenic life forms that are fighting back at Captain Ransom (John Savage) who has been slaughtering them for use in improving his equally marooned Starfleet ship, the Equinox.  Of course, once Janeway understands what Ransom and his crew have been doing, she does all that she can to stop them.

During the sixth season of ""Voyager"", Seven of Nine faces her past in episode ""Survival Instinct"", B'Elanna's ongoing struggle with her Klingon half is brought to the forefront in episode ""Barge of the Dead"", Tuvok suffers from neurological damage in episode ""Riddles"", Janeway & Voyager discover awakens an ancient race in episode ""Dragon's Teeth"", Chakotay gets excited over the discovery of a long-lost Martian probe in episode ""One Small Step"", Voyager is contacted by Starfleet thanks to Lt. Barclay in episode ""Pathfinder"", Borg children are discovered in episode ""Collective"", former Voyager crewmember Kes (Jennifer Lien) unexpectedly visits in episode ""Fury"" and Capt. Janeway with Seven of Nine again battle the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) in first of the two-part episode ""Unimatrix Zero"". The best sixth-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Survival Instinct"", ""Barge of the Dead"", ""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"", ""Riddles"", ""Dragon's Teeth"", ""One Small Step"" (possibly the best sixth-season episode), ""Pathfinder"", ""Fair Haven"", ""Blink of an Eye"" (the planet in accelerated time, a very good episode), ""Virtuoso"" (reality-check for the Doctor), ""Memorial"", ""Collective"",  ""Spirit Folk"", ""Child's Play"", ""Muse"", ""Fury"", ""Life Line"" and the season finale ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 1"".  The least memorable sixth-season episodes include ""Equinox, Part 2"", ""Alice"", ""Tsunkatse"", ""Good Shepherd"", ""Live Fast and Prosper"" and ""The Haunting of Deck Twelve"".

Overall, I rate the sixth season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was somewhat weaker than the fifth season, but did have several shining moments.",1100563200,9,4378,5.417033773861967

The season opener, while interesting to see the resolution of meeting another starship in the delta quadrant, didn't really make a lot of sense in that members of this crew were brought onboard and then promptly forgotten about. Seems like there would have been more story potential.

Several of these episodes were just painful to get through, simply at how bad they were. ""Alice"" (the jealous girlfriend shuttlecraft?) and ""Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy""/""Virtuoso"" mark some of the worst, with ""Tsunkatse"" (Seven fighting the Rock) being completely brainless.

Like most Star Trek series, the first season is it's weakest. This series, a little less so, but people like Neelix and the mixture of Federation/Maquis crew don't come into their own until the end of season 1/start of season 2. Some characters you don't meet until far later. Hang in there if it feels like a dry story. The first season is still important due to story though, so don't skip it.
