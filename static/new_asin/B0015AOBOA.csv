I would reccomend these Blondie DVD's to anyone who enjoys the old black and white movies.  They are so cute and most importantly clean viewing for the entire family.

Thanks to the folks out there who make films like this available to the public.  Thank you Amazon!!

Happy Viewers,

BLONDIEANA--

Penny Singleton co-starred with Arthur Lake in 28 BLONDIE comedies that were based on Chic Young's popular comic strip. Simultaneous to the movie series, they both had a decade-long ""Blondie"" CBS radio show. After the movie series ended in 1950 and with the demise of the Blondie television sitcom, this catalogue found renewed life on TV and ran for many years, most often as an hour-long Saturday afternoon show.

Miss Singleton began in vaudeville, where she was part of a children's act with Milton Berle and Gene Raymond. Outside of Blondie, she is best remembered as the voice of Jane Jetson.

Originally a child acrobat in the circus and then a dancer, Arthur Lake (along with Barbara Britton) helped resurrect 'Blondie' as a short-lived 1957 TV sitcom. It was his last Show Biz job. Lake's older sister Florence was the motor mouthed wife of long-suffering Edgar Kennedy in dozens of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RKO-Average-Man-shorts/dp/B0000AC8ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RKO ""Average Man"" shorts</a>.

Larry Simms played toddler Baby Dumpling in the early Blondie films and stayed with the series to the end. In '43 his character name was changed to Alexander. Simms appeared in a handful of films outside of Blondie, receiving screen credit as ""Baby Dumpling"" for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MR-SMITH-GOES-TO-WASHINGTON/dp/B001GLX6UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MR.

Under his own name he also played the youthful Pete Bailey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IT-S-A-WONDERFUL-LIFE/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE</a>&nbsp;(1946). Larry's career essentially ended with Blondie.

The 1943-50 screen r&eacute;sum&eacute; of Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead) consists solely of 16 Blondie films.",1259020800,8,2101,6.677655677655678

However, the DVD seems to consist of DVD from video with curious occasional timing adjustments.  It was claimed the sound was enhanced, but I believe the timing adjustments may have been made to synch the video and sound.

While the effect was strange, if you are the kind of person who wants the Blondie movies you will be the kind of person who will put up with the timing adjustments just to enjoy the opportunity to have them.",1233014400,29,513,4.543478260869565

3143628,5,B0015AOBOA,"This box set was my second purchase of a Blondie set. This set includes what I believe are all the films made between 1938 and 1950. The last of the set has a new Mr. Dithers (not Jonathan Hale) who suddenly reappears as Dagwood's boss. In the previous film, Mr. Radcliffe was the boss, as he had been since the business was sold to him by J.C. Dithers. It made me wonder if there was a missing film.

Neverthenonetheless, this is a wonderful box set. The Bumsteads go from the parents of one child, Baby Dumpling, and one Dog, Daisy, to the parents of Alexander, the grownup name of their son, who's insisted on it since he started school, Daisy, and her little family of five pups, and Cookie, their daughter who was accidentally named by a policeman who stopped them for traveling too slowly on their way home from the hospital with their new addition. He called her a cute little cookie and Dagwood and Alexander picked it up, protested by mother of course, but it gradually became her name.

In my earlier review I've extolled the virtues of the talented performers in this series. Arthur Lake, the perennial klutz who still manages to hold on to his job as the assistant designer of a construction firm through creative ideas and the help of a very clever wife. Penny Singleton, a talented young actress with a great singing voice and a brilliant sense of comedic timing carries her little family through the Depression and the War with humor and humanity, and Larry Simms, who grows from a cute little toddler, identified in the credits for Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington as ""Baby Dumpling"" into a young man. Daisy, the ""pin-up pooch"" who seems to turn up in films all over the screen in this period of time (in Capra's Meet John Doe, she's the dog who creeps out of the way when she hears Gary Cooper apologize for dripping his wet raincoat on the floor, like she thought she'd be blamed for the puddle)manages everything from fetching the paper to helping coax a little girl out of her wheelchair and learning to walk.

The supplier of the DVD set was very helpful. Her service was prompt and courteous. While it took only a short time to receive the set after I ordered it, I found I was savoring the viewing over a course of weeks.

3143650,4,B0015AOBOA,"Blondie - Collectors Edition

Blondie and Dagwood were taken from the popular comic strip from the 1930s. Twenty-eight movies were produced from 1938 to 1950 until a scandal with one actor put an end to the series. This is the complete set of `B' pictures that ran for about seventy minutes each. They starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. Hollywood produced films from characters in newspaper comic strips. The ""Blondie"" comic strip began in the early 1930s and is still published after nearly eight decades. Many other comic strips from that time are long gone. The comic situations which reflect ordinary realities continue. The public accepted Hollywood's portrayal of ordinary family life and its stereotypes. The two or three films produced each year were all good. Some of the details told about the times like other films of that era. Have they aged well? Look at the family comedies of today for comparison. Dorothy McNulty made her debut in ""After the Thin Man"".

I don't know the reason why Dagwood is portrayed as a bungler and Blondie as all-knowing, but it was acceptable to the audiences. Dagwood is shown as having a private office and the principal assistant to J. C. Dithers, the owner of a construction company. The shaky employment prospects of Dagwood as a white-collar worker must have resonated with the primarily blue-collar audiences. The Bumsteads live in their own home, they are not renters in an apartment or tenement. Note how few people own a car, people lived near work and shopping. These films provide a look at life from seventy years ago. What did you notice? Note how conflicts over money cause most of the problems. Blondie handles the money and budget in these movies. In real life Dagwood the professional would likely have done this. Here are the movies in historical order.

Blondie (1938); Blondie Meets the Boss (1939)
Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939); Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939)
Blondie on a Budget (1940); Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940)
Blondie Plays Cupid (1940); Blondie Goes Latin (1941)
Blondie In Society (1941); Blondie Goes to College (1942)
Blondie's Blessed Event (1942); Blondie For Victory (1942)
It's a Great Life (1943); Foot Light Glamour (1943)

Leave it to Blondie (1945); Life With Blondie (1945)
Blondie's Lucky Day (1946); Blondie Knows Best (1946)
Blondie's Big Moment (1947); Blondie's Holiday (1947)
Blondie's in the Dough (1947); Blondie's Anniversary (1947)
Blondie's Reward (1948); Blondie's Secret (1948)

Oh, also, fun trivia, Penny Singleton (Blondie herself) was also the voice of the iconic Jane Jetson. (Y'all remember that, right?)

Though, I have to say, watching it now as opposed to 12 years ago, I have a slightly different look at it, for two reasons:

1.)Blondie ran that household, but was clever enough to do it in a way that made her husband still feel like the man, rather than purposely emasculate him, as many women on today's movies and shows do. Both parties would be happier if that weren't the case, jmho.

2.)I'm watching ""Baby Dumpling"", and all I think the whole time is That's my 3 year old. It's funny, he reminds me so much of him...

There was this one scene where he was gonna punch this little bratty neighbor kid, and the other kid's like, ""I'll tell your Mother!"", so he goes and puts himself in time-out!

I taped most of the series on VHS when shown on various networks about twenty five years ago. When one of the tapes recently came unwound I decided to purchase this set.  I had read various reviews of this stating that the sequencing was off somewhat and that these DVDs were recorded from VHS versions. They are not the movies released by Columbia, they are recorded from the versions released by television. It was also stated that many people found this problem with the pacing irritating, (by the pacing it means that the film may slow somewhat - it's not playing at normal speed). Also the soundtrack was a little creaky as well. I played the first Blondie episode from this set and found the pacing problem very irritating. I have much better quality in my VHS tapes. The second and third episodes that I played from this set weren't as bad as the first, but, there were some pacing problems as well. However, I can live with it as I really love this series. Wish that Columbia would release a REAL version DVD set from their master copies. THAT would probably be superb.

I originally discovered these movies when they were broadcast on cable TV in the 1990's. Both Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake were well cast as Blondie and Dagwood and they received good support from Jonathan Hale and others. Shemp Howard even guested in one movie (very well).
As in many B movie series of those days, the first films were very well made in order to establish the series. The first 4 years of movies were all excellent here. As the series became more established, the quality of the Blondie movies in later years was not as consistent. Even the least of the movies still is enjoyable to Blondie fans though. Overall, I would rate this 4.5 stars with many 5 star movies, especially in the early years of the series.",1267228800,,852,4.538961038961039

BLONDIEANA--

Penny Singleton co-starred with Arthur Lake in 28 BLONDIE comedies that were based on Chic Young's popular comic strip. Simultaneous to the movie series, they both had a decade-long ""Blondie"" CBS radio show. After the movie series ended in 1950 and with the demise of the Blondie television sitcom, this catalogue found renewed life on TV and ran for many years, most often as an hour-long Saturday afternoon show.

Miss Singleton began in vaudeville, where she was part of a children's act with Milton Berle and Gene Raymond. Outside of Blondie, she is best remembered as the voice of Jane Jetson.

Originally a child acrobat in the circus and then a dancer, Arthur Lake (along with Barbara Britton) helped resurrect 'Blondie' as a short-lived 1957 TV sitcom. It was his last Show Biz job. Lake's older sister Florence was the motor mouthed wife of long-suffering Edgar Kennedy in dozens of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RKO-Average-Man-shorts/dp/B0000AC8ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RKO ""Average Man"" shorts</a>.

Larry Simms played toddler Baby Dumpling in the early Blondie films and stayed with the series to the end. In '43 his character name was changed to Alexander. Simms appeared in a handful of films outside of Blondie, receiving screen credit as ""Baby Dumpling"" for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MR-SMITH-GOES-TO-WASHINGTON/dp/B001GLX6UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MR.

Larry's career essentially ended with Blondie.

The 1943-50 screen r&eacute;sum&eacute; of Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead) consists solely of 16 Blondie films.",1259020800,8,2101,6.677655677655678

However, the DVD seems to consist of DVD from video with curious occasional timing adjustments.

3378125,5,B0015AOBOA,"This box set was my second purchase of a Blondie set. This set includes what I believe are all the films made between 1938 and 1950. The last of the set has a new Mr. Dithers (not Jonathan Hale) who suddenly reappears as Dagwood's boss. In the previous film, Mr. Radcliffe was the boss, as he had been since the business was sold to him by J.C. Dithers. It made me wonder if there was a missing film.

Neverthenonetheless, this is a wonderful box set. The Bumsteads go from the parents of one child, Baby Dumpling, and one Dog, Daisy, to the parents of Alexander, the grownup name of their son, who's insisted on it since he started school, Daisy, and her little family of five pups, and Cookie, their daughter who was accidentally named by a policeman who stopped them for traveling too slowly on their way home from the hospital with their new addition. He called her a cute little cookie and Dagwood and Alexander picked it up, protested by mother of course, but it gradually became her name.

In my earlier review I've extolled the virtues of the talented performers in this series. Arthur Lake, the perennial klutz who still manages to hold on to his job as the assistant designer of a construction firm through creative ideas and the help of a very clever wife. Penny Singleton, a talented young actress with a great singing voice and a brilliant sense of comedic timing carries her little family through the Depression and the War with humor and humanity, and Larry Simms, who grows from a cute little toddler, identified in the credits for Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington as ""Baby Dumpling"" into a young man. Daisy, the ""pin-up pooch"" who seems to turn up in films all over the screen in this period of time (in Capra's Meet John Doe, she's the dog who creeps out of the way when she hears Gary Cooper apologize for dripping his wet raincoat on the floor, like she thought she'd be blamed for the puddle)manages everything from fetching the paper to helping coax a little girl out of her wheelchair and learning to walk.

The supplier of the DVD set was very helpful. Her service was prompt and courteous. While it took only a short time to receive the set after I ordered it, I found I was savoring the viewing over a course of weeks.

3378147,4,B0015AOBOA,"Blondie - Collectors Edition

Blondie and Dagwood were taken from the popular comic strip from the 1930s. Twenty-eight movies were produced from 1938 to 1950 until a scandal with one actor put an end to the series. This is the complete set of `B' pictures that ran for about seventy minutes each. They starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. Hollywood produced films from characters in newspaper comic strips. The ""Blondie"" comic strip began in the early 1930s and is still published after nearly eight decades. Many other comic strips from that time are long gone. The comic situations which reflect ordinary realities continue. The public accepted Hollywood's portrayal of ordinary family life and its stereotypes. The two or three films produced each year were all good. Some of the details told about the times like other films of that era. Have they aged well? Look at the family comedies of today for comparison. Dorothy McNulty made her debut in ""After the Thin Man"".

I don't know the reason why Dagwood is portrayed as a bungler and Blondie as all-knowing, but it was acceptable to the audiences. Dagwood is shown as having a private office and the principal assistant to J. C. Dithers, the owner of a construction company. The shaky employment prospects of Dagwood as a white-collar worker must have resonated with the primarily blue-collar audiences. The Bumsteads live in their own home, they are not renters in an apartment or tenement. Note how few people own a car, people lived near work and shopping. These films provide a look at life from seventy years ago. What did you notice? Note how conflicts over money cause most of the problems. Blondie handles the money and budget in these movies. In real life Dagwood the professional would likely have done this. Here are the movies in historical order.

Blondie (1938); Blondie Meets the Boss (1939)
Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939); Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939)
Blondie on a Budget (1940); Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940)

Some Discs have a same sound problem in only a few spots; nothing to stress over.,1289001600,2,390,4.283783783783784
3378161,5,B0015AOBOA,"I cannot begin to express how happy I am with my purchase of the original Blondie (1937-1950) movie series DVDs. I had searched the internet over and over for the complete set and could only find the volumes 1 and 2 discs that only showed 10 of the 28 movies that were made. This purchase has made me very happy, as I just adore the Blondie movie classics. Whoo-hoo to this seller!",1288310400,,381,4.305555555555555
3378162,5,B0015AOBOA,"I am (almost) certain everyone here remembers the old comic strip of ""Blondie"", but, does anyone remember the movie serials? There were 28 of them, and they ran from 1938-1950. I watched with my granddad on Sunday mornings early the reruns, and I got the entire collection for my birthday, and rewatching one with my husband last night, I had almost forgotten how adorably cute and still hilarious they are!

Oh, also, fun trivia, Penny Singleton (Blondie herself) was also the voice of the iconic Jane Jetson. (Y'all remember that, right?)

Though, I have to say, watching it now as opposed to 12 years ago, I have a slightly different look at it, for two reasons:

1.)Blondie ran that household, but was clever enough to do it in a way that made her husband still feel like the man, rather than purposely emasculate him, as many women on today's movies and shows do. Both parties would be happier if that weren't the case, jmho.

2.)I'm watching ""Baby Dumpling"", and all I think the whole time is That's my 3 year old. It's funny, he reminds me so much of him...

There was this one scene where he was gonna punch this little bratty neighbor kid, and the other kid's like, ""I'll tell your Mother!"", so he goes and puts himself in time-out!

Blondie: Baby Dumpling! What did you do?
Baby Dumpling: ... nothing... yet...",1288137600,2,1320,4.619658119658119
3378163,2,B0015AOBOA,"I read up on this product before purchasing on Amazon, as I am an ardent Blondie-phile. I taped most of the series on VHS when shown on various networks about twenty five years ago. When one of the tapes recently came unwound I decided to purchase this set.  I had read various reviews of this stating that the sequencing was off somewhat and that these DVDs were recorded from VHS versions. They are not the movies released by Columbia, they are recorded from the versions released by television. It was also stated that many people found this problem with the pacing irritating, (by the pacing it means that the film may slow somewhat - it's not playing at normal speed). Also the soundtrack was a little creaky as well. I played the first Blondie episode from this set and found the pacing problem very irritating. I have much better quality in my VHS tapes. The second and third episodes that I played from this set weren't as bad as the first, but, there were some pacing problems as well. However, I can live with it as I really love this series. Wish that Columbia would release a REAL version DVD set from their master copies. THAT would probably be superb.

Anytime I tried to record them onto VHS some years ago when AMC had a marathon, the stupid cable would go out and I only got parts of the movies.  We have been watching them in order on our movie nights at home. They certainly have captured the attention of my husband and daughter.  I hope they re-stock these, because I would by some more of them as gifts for family members.

3378173,5,B0015AOBOA,"The Blondie series was a B movie series made by Columbia from 1938 to 1950 based on the popular and beloved comic strip. I originally discovered these movies when they were broadcast on cable TV in the 1990's. Both Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake were well cast as Blondie and Dagwood and they received good support from Jonathan Hale and others. Shemp Howard even guested in one movie (very well).
As in many B movie series of those days, the first films were very well made in order to establish the series. The first 4 years of movies were all excellent here. As the series became more established, the quality of the Blondie movies in later years was not as consistent. Even the least of the movies still is enjoyable to Blondie fans though. Overall, I would rate this 4.5 stars with many 5 star movies, especially in the early years of the series.",1267228800,,852,4.538961038961039

8257995,5,B0015AOBOA,"Based upon Chic Young's Blondie and Dagwood comic strip (1930-73). I discovered the ""Blondie"" movies series (1938-50) on late-night television in the 1980's. They were so delightfully funny and entertaining. Eventually, they became available on VHS, but it wasn't until 2004 only the first ten movies became available in a DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blondie-Volumes-1-and-2/dp/B0001JXP2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blondie, Volumes 1 and 2</a>.
 With all hope lost of ever seeing the ""Blondie"" movies on television again and VHS players a thing of the past, a wonderful thing happened in 2008. Like the clouds of heaven had opened up, Amazon.com and the ATI Corporation offered a complete DVD set of all 28 ""Blondie"" movies in one sturdy container.
 Every Blondie and Dagwood movie from Columbia Pictures is here in this limited, very special 9-disc set. The first disc contains the first 4 movies on the front side and the following discs with the 3 movies each.  Each disc is in a protective sleeve.
  I do not believe the movies are restored, but the container states they are ""Digitally remastered - sound enhanced"". The back of the container states, ""Due to age, these vintage classics may show slight imperfections. They have been mastered from the best sources for the highest quality possible"".
  The slight imperfection is due to re-recording, the movie print may slow for a quick second and speed up to the next frame a few times during the movie, but it does not effect the sound at all nor the continuation. You will get use to this and it really isn't that bad a flaw. It's just like watching the movie on television.

 Here is a list of the ""Blondie"" films release order:
1. Blondie (1938).
2. Blondie Meet the Boss (1939).
3. Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939).
4. Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939).
5. Blondie on a Budget (1940).
6. Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940).
7. Blondie Plays Cupid (1940).
8. Blondie Goes Latin (1941).
9. Blondie in Society (1941).
10. Blondie Goes to College (1942).
11. Blondie's Blessed Event (1942).
12. Blondie For Victory (1942).
13. It's a Great Life (1943).
14. Footlight Glamour (1943).
15. Leave It to Blondie (1945).
16. Life With Blondie (1946).
17. Blondie's Lucky Day (1946).
18. Blondie's Knows Best (1946).

26. Blondie Hits the Jackpot (1949).
27. Blondie's Hero (1950).
