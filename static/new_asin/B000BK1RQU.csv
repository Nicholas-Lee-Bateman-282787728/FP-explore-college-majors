Olesen is the writer and director of this film produced in 2003 and also contributes to the extras featured on the disc including a Q&A and a brief chat with each of the main stars.
Borgen viewers will probably recognise two of the stars of Borgen Benedikte Hansen and Petrine Agger who appear in In Your Hands as inmates of the women's prison in which the story is set. Trine Dyrholm is fantastic playing the role of Kate Kristoffersen a transferee into the prison after getting into problems at another location. She soon alienates herself from the other women and seeks solace in the arms of one of the male prison guard, her contact officer played by Nicolaj Kopernikus.
Perfect performances by all the cast but none more so than the scenes involving Ann Eleonora Jrgensen who plays a priest, Anna. Anna applies for the temporary position filling in for an older male priest in the prison and shows a good empathy with the prisoners, if not a good understanding of the prison rules. Anna believes she may be pregnant after the suggestiuon is made to her by one of he inmates. Together with her partner we see how the pregnancy is dealt with and the moral dilemmas posed to Anna and her night-shift working partner. Anna decides to look into what crimes Kate has committed to land her into custody and then reacts in a way that an expectant mother may in her situation.
The film is certainly worth a re-watch, something I'll probably be doing later in the year.

Interestingly the Danish title of The Killing is FORBRYDELSEN (meaning The Crime) and the Danish title of this film is FORBRYDELSER (meaning Crimes).

8087537,4,B000BK1RQU,"As a jail chaplain, I found this story powerful and compelling.  The protaganist is a new female priest, who serves as an interim chaplain at a Scandanavian prison for women.  She begins as a breath of fresh air for the inmates, humble, yet hopeful, holy, yet willing to offer that cup of cold water to sinners.  However, the chaplain is also middle-aged, and childless.  A new inmate comes into the prison--one who is said to have a gift of healing.  Yet, she is cautious, and somewhat distant.  When she first encounters the priest with her ""Anytime you want to talk, let me know"" greeting, the healer's answer is shocking:  take care of yourself and your child!  Sure enough she turns up pregnant.  As the story progresses, there is a staff-inmate romance, the healer's past crime puts the now-pregnant chaplain into a crisis of her own, and the story winds up to a powerful, troubling, truly dramatic finish.

The acting here is subtle, yet compelling.  The setting is somewhat realistic,  However, for Americans like myself, used to very crowded facilities, the one portrayed here almost looked like a country club.  Also, some of the actions committed by the correctional staff seemed quite laxadasical.  Nevertheless, the overall impression was true to life, and true to heart!

Bottom-line:  This is a powerful film, done is the form of classic tragedy.  When you finish, you'll be left meditating on Jesus' words to ""Judge not, lest you be judged.""",1129766400,2,1457,4.905737704918033
