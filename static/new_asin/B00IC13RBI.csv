6256721,3,B00IC13RBI,"Being a huge Rush fan, I'll watch anything about the band that comes down the pike.  And I knew I was in trouble when the opening salvo of low resolution, vintage stills were accompanied by non-Rush music.  When a documentary on a band has little or no music from that band featured in the documentary, that's your first clue the documentary in question is not sanctioned by the band.

What we have here is essentially a collection of previously recorded interviews and music videos ripped from youtube intertwined with B and C level Rush engineers/critics/biographers; the credibility of which should immediately be called into question when the bulk of them don't know how to pronounce Neil Peart's last name.  Heads up: its ""Peeert,"" like ""ear.""

Sadly, the documentary ultimately fails because the viewer doesn't learn anything new about the band or its music.",1399939200,104,864,5.013986013986014
6256722,5,B00IC13RBI,My husband loves everything Rush and goes to concerts every tour for over 30 yrs so when this came out it was a perfect gift for any rush fan,1399852800,3,141,3.896551724137931
6256723,4,B00IC13RBI,"Insights from a few people close to the band worth hearing, interwoven with previously published interviews with Geddy, Alex and Neil.  The editing /production is pretty good given the source materials used.  The candid comments from roadie/engineer were interesting wrt early club scene success, ouster of John Rutsey, and opinions of albums.
  If you have the full catalogue of albums, videos, shirts, hats, sox and books (and now even comic books), this is a good addition to the stockpile and worth the two hours watching time (my 9 year old comments ""over already?  That's like half a Rush concert's duration""...  He's been to 8 shows so far).",1399852800,3,648,5.009345794392523
6256724,1,B00IC13RBI,"Not the band, but the documentary maker.... really cheap production with not one band interview I've not yet seen. Most of the pics I've seen as well. The menu is very basic, graphics bad, and the background music highly annoying. The only item of interest is Paul Northfield's commentary.

What SHOULD have been done was the following..
Interview family or friends.
Interview road crew. One member is interviewed only and briefly.
Interview manufacturers and endorsement companies.
Interview agents, promoters, management.
Interview band or bands whom worked with Rush.
But the above was not done.

There's nothing new here and I'd compare this to a bad movie sequel.. I'm not trying to showboat here....this is really a poorly done documentary.",1399766400,15,746,5.260504201680672
6256725,2,B00IC13RBI,"The video and audio on my disc kept going in and out of sync. Most of the video is available already on Youtube, although the interviews can be nice at times. There is not so much actual Rush music available and there are lots of zoom ins and zoom outs on still photos that long time fans have long ago seen. If the disc worked it would be worth perhaps half the set retail price. Nice that it is long, if only the disc played properly.",1399420800,25,436,4.0813953488372094
6256726,5,B00IC13RBI,I haven't seen this film (yet) but I love Rush so I'm just going to assume that any piece that casts them in a favourable light is good. Merely having the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame acknowledge them is not good enough. I want a religion built around my favourite Canadian trio and I won't be satisfied until being a Rush fan carries a tax free status.,1399334400,14,349,4.147058823529412
6256727,5,B00IC13RBI,My all time favorite band since the mid 80s,1484438400,,43,3.888888888888889
6256728,3,B00IC13RBI,"I watched this documentary on demand, I own Beyond the Lights, every Rush Album, saw them in 1981 and 2004. They are without a doubt gifted musicians and song writers. I read some reviews on this doc so I went in thinking it would be one of this really cheap generic documentaries that have no input from the band and no actual music from the band. I do think many negative reviews must have come from people who didn't make it past the first 15 minutes as the generic sounding Rush music clips are extremely off putting and bring the whole production down to informercial level.

With that said, I was surprised when bits of early live footage began showing up with the original audio intact? This is baffling to me, it you can only afford to pay for some of the music and not all, just use the same music over again as needed. NO ONE wants to hear generic music while watching a documentary about a band. The documentary is actually pretty good and it does give us a little more insight on certain albums than BTLS. It only covers the first album through Moving Pictures..with a small mention of Signals, if they ever make a part two i would surely be interested in it.

If you have BTLS and you could find this for $5.00 I think it would be a good compliment to the other far superior documentary. The generic music clips are very sparse after the first 15-20 minutes and they do use a fair amount of actual Rush music through out the 2 plus hour documentary. I found that they allowed more time for each album on this one especially some of the less commercially accepted albums. Some have said some contributors pronounced Neil's last name wrong, but I didn't notice, but really its a minor quibble unless the entire doc had people mispronouncing it and making a bunch of ridiculous false statements.

I have seen similar documentaries like this for other bands, but this one is definitely above average, the band members are present, their is some old footage of some live performances, yes low grade and in small clips, but it does add to give this doc some credibility.

As far as people complaining there is no Blu Ray, Blu Ray would not help this documentary out at all, the low resolution of the concert footage would look horrible in HD and no amount of remastering is going to make it look better. We are watching a documentary for the information, it isn't a concert, sure it would be great if everything looked like a 4K remaster, but I think we are just getting too spoiled, it's not enough that the footage exists anymore, it has to look pristine with next generation audio.

I can not comment on the actual DVD, but the documentary clocked in at a little over 2 hours, I was never bored. Did I learn anything new? Actually yes, most of this is retread, but Rush fans should give this a look if you see in On Demand of find the DVD in a bargain bin.",1470268800,,2866,4.420454545454546

No, the background music does not feature Rush's music. And no, not all of the interviewees pronounce Neil Peart's name correctly. Newsflash, guys: none of those things are absolutely necessary in the aim of making a solid, informative documentary.

getting past the minor inconvenience of the voice sadly not tracking with the picture well, the disc features minor bits of interviews from the band themselves, but mostly from people in the business, like critics, as well as radio and studio personnel, most of which the uneducated have never heard of, but people who are indeed 'liner note' readers, and especially 'british music paper' lovers, will know most of them by heart..they are the cream of the crop when it comes to music worldwide, and make this a must for anyone who wants to, not only listen to the music, but also wants to know what they are listening to....",1434931200,2,879,4.782894736842105

I found the interviews with critics and (unlike stated in an earlier review) a long time member of the crew from the early days and a recording engineer who has worked with Rush extensively to be quite informative. Who cares if Rush's music isn't used for background purposes, the in-depth reviews of recordings from their beginnings up to Signals was something I had never seen before.

6256762,5,B00IC13RBI,"Having read a lot of reviews already here about this DVD, I thought it worthwhile to go to the trouble of writing my own just to help clear some fog some folks may be having about this DVD, as there seems to be mixed views about it...

1st. Should you already own "" Beyond the Lighted Stage"", this DVD will augment the over-all experience of the history of RUSH, especially if you thought that the discussions held on each album passed too quickly on the ""Lighted Stage"" DVD. This one offers more time time to realize & appraise each album, even if the reviews themselves are similar in outcome. For example, the album "" A Farewell to Kings"" is hardly mentioned at all on the Lighted Stage DVD, so I very much welcomed the appraisal found here for what is one of RUSH's best records ever ! So missing pieces to the RUSH puzzle are collected & presented on this baby folks.

2nd. The fact that interview footage ""of the time"" is used rather than ""in the present"" eliminates ""hind-sight"", so a more accurate appraisal by the band is provided at the time of a particular records release, (or with interviews back in the 1990's), so it's interesting to hear their thoughts / opinions about matters earlier in time.

3rd. Being an independent production also means that perhaps a more evenly balanced point-of-view results, as the editing process remains independent from the band & managers etc. You get warts & all, so the ""truth"" or accuracy of events is more easy to identify.

I believe that the only fault with this release is that it it stops at the bands early rise to grand-fame in he early 1980's ( Signals album ), so this only proves that even more time is needed to completely cover the bands career through the 1980's & 90's, & then through the 2000's...I hope that the same people get to make another ""Part II"" DVD of this band !

This one is titled ""The Rise of Kings"", so the next one has to be called ""The Reign of Kings"" ! I'm very much looking forward to it's release one-day !

6256764,2,B00IC13RBI,"First of all lets get one thing straight.

I put Rush right behind The Beatles in terms of the Greatest Bands that ever existed so my gripe with this documentary (?) is not with Rush.

Ten minutes into it I basically turned it off from boredom because it was three boring guys talking about Rush and using ""Archival"" footage of the Greatest Trio in Rock

This documentary is just a bunch of no-name talking heads, freely available trailers & publicity shots, using some ridiculous mockery of Rush's music - not their own music since the producers did not want to expend any money to actually purchase any rights to use Rush's own music.

This is another bandwagon jumper, trying to cash in on Rush's recent popularity. It's crap, and nothing but crap. About the only good thing I can say about it, is at least it's not attacking Rush, like most of the industry did for decades, until all of a sudden they're now popular and everyone wants a piece of them.
