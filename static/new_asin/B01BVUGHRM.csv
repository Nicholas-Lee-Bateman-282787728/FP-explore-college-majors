8751660,1,B01BVUGHRM,Not helpful. One would have to already know the essentials of the art to use this CD.,1512432000,,85,4.0588235294117645
8751661,4,B01BVUGHRM,"This DVD is helpful to establish a morning and evening routine with Tai Chi.  The best part of this set is you don't have to listen to a master describing each move and going over it several times..  That can get very very boring.  If you have taken classes, the instruction in here can be a little 'slow' but it is very helpful.",1481932800,,329,4.190476190476191

8751663,3,B01BVUGHRM,"The dvds seem like an excellent resource I'd give more star(s) to, but was disappointed to be unable to load them onto my iPad STRICTLY FOR MY OWN USE, so my gripe is with Amazon, not Mr Rones or his dvds. My ""Big Mac"" is in on the desk in my cluttered home office without much free floor space and not a particularly inspiring place in which to learn a new tai chi form, so I don't often play the dvds, which I would do if I could play them on my iPad in my pleasant loung room or lovely, leafy back garden. Wish they could have been made more accessible. Sigh. Maybe some day... otherwise, they seem very worthwhile and at a fair price out here in Australia.",1477699200,,660,4.124031007751938
