1215050,5,B00000FYWR,"I saw the movie ""The Deep End"" yesterday and it was just stunning- probably one of the most beautiful, perfect films I have seen. It was intense, tragic, and provocative. The whole film takes place around water, and the colors of the film seems bathed in blue. I just can't describe how much I loved everything about it- the characters, the scenery, the pacing...
Tilda Swinton, who played the main character in this movie, was breathtaking. I haven't been as inspired by a performance since I saw Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"", and those of you who have known me for a while understand just how blown away I was by Swinton. Why isn't she in a million films?!
 I'm reading a lot of personal reviews on the internet and it seems like most people don't agree with my glowing review of ""The Deep End"", which is a shame. Even thought the critics tended to really like it, more films like it won't be made unless the audience responds well. I guess it requires some patience to watch, although to me the film just flew by. You are required to believe in the character's desperation and love for her child, which is what drives the movie. I can't believe people this film isn't resonating more with people who have children. I don't, but I could actually feel the fierce nature of a mother's - and the fact she would do *anything* to protect her child from harm.
If you have a chance, go see it. Even with all that is going on in my life, I was enveloped in this movie. I just lost track of everything else and just got absorbed in it- the colors, the sounds, the emotions, the intensity.",998784000,26,1582,4.436426116838488
1215051,5,B00000FYWR,"If someone had asked me who I thought should play the mother-in-peril role of Margaret Hall in ""The Deep End"" I would not have listed Tilda Swinton who heretofore has made a career of playing far-out characters as in ""Orlando"" in which she played both a man and a woman whose lives evolve over the course of several hundred years.  Be thankful I wasn't asked, for Tilda Swinton gives the performance of her lifetime in this film directed by the duo of David Seigel and Scott McGehee.  Set in the Lake Tahoe/Reno area, the plot of ""Deep End"" is straight out of film noir and as such usually doesn't allow for much in the way of delving into a characters personality or psychology.  All the chracters in a film noir are archetypes:  cool blond Grace Kelly in ""Dial M for Murder"" or Robert Mitchum as the tough, hard-drinking detective in ""D.O.A.""  Seigel/McGehee use the film noir tradition as a jumping off point and layer on the shadings and angles that can make a movie character ""pop"" as personified in the Alek Spera role played with an uncanny combination of danger, empathy and sympathy by Goran Visnjic (T.V.'s ""ER"").  Visnjic is a revelation is this role.  Notice how with just a slight eye or face movement he can transmit a multitude of emotions.  Great film actors use their faces to tell their stories.  Spera approaches Hall the first time to blackmail her for $50,000 over a sex tape that his boss, Carlie Nagel has in his possession. Smudging the bad guy/blackmailer image to the hilt, Spera quickly becomes attached to Hall and her family with surprising results that I will not reveal here.  What does transpire is that Visnjic and Swinton are such multi-faceted and complex characters involved in a many layered situation that you can't help but be fascinated by the whole enterprise.  If I had to make one small gripe it would be about the character of Darby Reese, a bar owner played by Josh Lucas.  This guy is strictly out of the Simon Legree mold of villian what with his pencil mustache and toothy sneer.  It's as if he belongs in another movie altogether.  But this is a minor mis-step in what is a terrific movie.  Bravo to all involved.",998006400,18,2162,4.62303664921466
1215052,2,B00000FYWR,"Hyped as a noir-ish look at a mother's struggle to protect her gay son, The Deep End ushers viewers back to a repressive era of cinema where same-sex love was sleazy and destructive, the ideal stuff for the ""thrilling"" blackmail that drives the plot. Nominally a remake of Max Ophul's ""The Reckless Moment,"" ""The Deep End"" also owes a heavy debt, in tenor at least, to that masterpiece of gay shame, ""The Victim."" Suffice to say this is the kind of film that presupposes whenever two men have sex, a third, ipso facto, must be there with a video camera. There is a certain fascination in watching Tilda Swinton do whatever it takes to make sure she and her family don't have to talk about the love that dare not speak its name while maintaining the order of her oppressive, regimented, uptight world -- a world that no doubt sent sonny boy off looking for an alcoholic, abusive chicken hawk/extortionist to cuddle up to in the first place. And yet for all of her Herculean efforts to dispose of bodies, cars and lowlife thugs, she can't manage to get past her son's hurt and confusion to talk about ""it."" If this is the parenting model for the new millennium, who needs it! The movie's centerpiece -- Tilda Swinton's performance -- proves yet again that she has raised the staring-blankly-into-the-camera school of acting into a semi-art. At least all the water looked refreshing.",997920000,8,1380,4.706611570247934
1215053,5,B00000FYWR,"Finally, for the year 2001, we have an intelligent thriller that doesn't involve futuristic apes, a too-cute humanoid, or waves of pesky bombers attacking a love triangle. And it was almost certainly produced on an infinitely smaller budget.
THE DEEP END stars Tilda Swinton as Margaret Hall, the mother heading a family of five (herself, two sons, daughter, father-in-law) while hubby is off doing Guy Stuff - commanding an aircraft carrier at sea. As mothers sometimes do, she discovers that her oldest son Beau (played by Jonathan Tucker) has become pals with an older man who's exerting a really bad influence. The plot quickly thickens as Beau's new bud shows up in the middle of the night at the Hall's shorefront home on Lake Tahoe and, without anybody knowing, gets himself killed on the property in an accident so silly it/s almost funny. Margaret discovers the corpse the next morning. Not wishing to have her son involved in a potentially scandalous police investigation that will hurt his chances of getting admitted to a hoity-toity college, she hides the body in the lake. Of course, the body is soon found, but the cops don't have a clue. Then the sleazy blackmailer Alek (played by Goran Visnjic) shows up with a videotape of ... well, you'll see.
Even though I don't live in a vacuum, I've never heard of the principal actors in this splendid suspense drama. Swinton is positively riveting as the harassed Mom trying to keep control of downward spiraling events before the Good Life goes to Hades in a handbasket. Tucker is infuriatingly good as the son who just doesn't 'get it'. Best of all, the character of Alek is the biggest surprise of the storyline. And, the film is photographed in one of the true garden spots of California/Nevada. It shows what the Good Life can be if one is allowed to enjoy it. In this excellent summer drama, poor Margaret doesn't have the chance.
I exceptionally enjoyed an advance screening of this film. Though it'll likely be released to only a few theaters, see it if you have the chance.",996969600,10,2041,4.784702549575071

1215084,4,B00000FYWR,I really enjoyed this movie. I have to say I've seen Tilda Swinton in a few things and she impresses me every time. She's a great actress though quite underrated if you ask me. This movie was on point on so many levels. It was an intelligent suspense tale along the lines of Hitchcock. If you like movies that will keep you guessing and entertained at the same time you should check it out. The acting and writing is fantastic.,1456272000,,427,4.35
1215085,1,B00000FYWR,"I hate it... Not the movie. I didn't get to watch the movie. But I did find out that Amazon video services and customer service are incompetent at supporting Kindle breakdowns. I was easily able to order the video and Amazon immediately billed me for my purchase but then I could neither stream nor download the video. Repeated contact with customer service resulted in my being asked to repeat the same fruitless error resolution steps. After each failed resolution I was promised that an expert from video services would contact me 'within the next two days'. What? I should wait by the phone for two days? Well, I didn't wait by the phone so it doesn't matter, no expert from video services has contacted me in three days or at least none left a message.

1215144,4,B00000FYWR,"Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) lives in a house on the shores of beautiful Lake Tahoe with her three children and an aging father-in-law. Her husband is in the U.S. Navy and is away at sea. Her son, Beau Hall (Jonathan Tucker) is enticed into a homosexual relationship with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), sleazy owner of the nightclub The Deep End. Although Beau thinks the affair is secret, his mother Margaret already knows so she goes to see Reese to try to buy him off and leave her son alone. That same evening, Reese comes to call at the Hall household, gets into a fight with Beau, and ends up dead in the water. Unfortunately, there are others who also know about Beau's relationship with Reese. Another apparent associate of Reese's, Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic), shows up at the Hall home with a video tape of Reese and Beau together. He demands $50,000 from Margaret or threatens to send the tape to the police. But Alek is not working alone and he too has someone threatening him. This is a first-rate thriller, though I didn't find Swinton's performance totally convincing.",1376352000,,1078,4.708994708994709
1215145,5,B00000FYWR,If you're thinking this movie has a predictable ending you'd be wrong and considering there was no GPS during these events it's surprisingly well documented.,1364083200,,157,5.32
1215146,3,B00000FYWR,"A while back I was listening to a ""high brow"" talking- head discussion about the sea-change that has been occurring in the way American parenting has evolved over the past thirty years or so (the speakers however covered themselves with the caveat that this trend excludes certain ethnic, racial, cultural and class exceptions, in short, this was about how middle, now middle, and upper class parents raise their progeny). The gist of the argument is that the new ""coddle"" generation (say those under thirty, okay) have never learned to fail, parents have never allowed them to experience failure, and therefore they have never learned how to fly out of the nest unaided and therefore are ill-equipped to face the wicked old world and its snares. And that seems pretty close to some personal anecdotal evidence I have accumulated over the years.

Subsequently I watched this film, The Deep End, which seems to be nothing but a homage to the trend those speakers spoke of- ""coddle"" nation. Here dear old mom (well not so old, at least not so old looking, played by Tilda Swinton) has to play mom and dad (dad off flying planes somewhere) and is forced to ""pick up"" after her teenage sonny boy. Seems he had a torrid love affair with an older man, the older man, a sleaze, tried to put the dough bite on mom to keep things quiet, sonny boy didn't like that when he found out and confronted that older man about it. Older man fell off the family pier where the confrontation took pace and the chase was on, for mom that is. Sonny boy just kind of went about his teen alienated way.

First mom, no problem, disposed of the incriminating older man's body, including a dip in the lake to help let it sink. Then all hell breaks loose. It seems that the older man took some very compromising video of the pair having sex and that video would up in exactly the wrong hands, some sleaze associate and his enforcer.  So blackmail, big time blackmail entered the scene. Of course mom had no serious ready cash on hand when the enforcer man came calling and so things deteriorated  from there, although ever resourceful mom tried every avenue, including hocking her jewels, to come up with the dough. The squeeze was on though from the sleaze associate, although the enforcer, kind of smitten with mom and her pluckiness, started going to bat for her, and lost his own life over it in the end. That messy battle over with life went back to normal. With sonny boy head in the clouds, not a care in the world. Now that I think of it though I wouldn't have minded a mom like that although with my own hard-faced mom I learned to face this wicked old world, and survive.",1360454400,,2653,4.543933054393306
1215147,5,B00000FYWR,"Tilda is amazing in this.  Sure, there are some weird holes in the plot, but definitely worth a watch.  Suprizing that the gay and lesbian communities were not up in arms over at least parts of this - portraying the gay character (club owner) as sleaze, molestor, preditor-type normally annoys certain people.  That aside, it is indeed suspensful and held my attention throughout.  The filming and scenery were great, but best was Tilda's acting.  For more like this (moms in severe crisis mode) be sure not to miss ""We need to talk about Kevin"".....also amazing!",1355097600,,563,4.88421052631579
1215148,4,B00000FYWR,"The Deep End is a pretty good movie.  The movie title has two meanings (one obvious, one subtle) and you'll see why when you begin to watch how the events unfold.

A mother has a son that has a preference for men, and after a scuffle she hears in the middle of the night, the next morning she takes a walk and discovers the dead body of her sons boyfriend laying on the ground.  Now THIS presents an interesting situation.  If she were to report it to the police, they'd find out the dead guy was the boyfriend of the mothers son and would obviously accuse him of murder due to a fight that had taken place the night before between the two of them.  A caring loving mother in the Jodie Foster look-alike Tilda Swinton wouldn't want that, would she?  By the way she's a FANTASTIC actress and totally nails her role as a protective mother.  No, she wouldn't want that- she'd want to protect her sons potential involvement and keep a low profile, so she finds a sneaky and convincing way to ditch the body.

Here's where I'm caught in a tough situation.  If I explain anything more, I'd ruin all the crucial events that take place throughout the movie.  So let's just say, a mysterious guy shows up one day and knows about the guys death and demands a large sum of money or the video evidence that he's somehow obtained would *easily* target the mothers son and have him locked in prison for murder.  From here, several ""I can't believe Tilda's luck- easily the worst day of her life!"" moments take place involving not only Tilda's character, but her father, her son, the mysterious money-demanding man, and another less-than-friendly character that plays a big role near the end.

The ending is very satisfying I thought.  Everything was wrapped up accordingly.  The pace overall is relatively slow but it always leads to a memorable scene so there's no problem there.  I recommend it.",1341792000,,1883,4.5625
1215149,1,B00000FYWR,This is a rare occasion where I disagree with Roger Ebert. I just don't see what's so great about this movie. It's very simple. The performances are good and some of the elements were interesting. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I read the book. By the end I was thankful it was over.,1313971200,4,288,4.254545454545455
1215150,4,B00000FYWR,"I just love character-driven dramas like this film...at least when they are done well. And this small indie film was very well made. It's actually a bit of a ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" as well. But at its core its about the characters.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars and can't encourage you enough to see this movie. I caught in on HBO recently and it reminded me I needed to add it to my DVD collection.  Surprisingly, the film has two directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, which is rare. And its even rarer that the 2 are not brothers, which seems to be the typical co-director types.

This was the first film where I was introduced to Tilda Swinton, and it was one of actor Goran Visnjic's first major movie roles, after he joined the ER cast on tv. Both actors are perfectly cast in their roles, and the chemistry between them is wonderful. The way their relationship develops from ""enemies"" to ""friends"" is well written and well acted. I don't want to give too much about the plot away since that is where the enjoyment of this movie lies. Swinton plays Margaret, the mother of a family of three kids, with her husband Tom out at sea in the Navy. She has her husband's elderly father at the house with the kids, but she's the captain of this family ship while her husband is away. The eldest son, Beau, played with perfect teen angst by Jonathan Tucker, is discovering his sexuality by fooling around with a gay nightclub owner named Darby, played surprisingly well by Josh Lucas. Unfortunately, Darby accidentally dies while visiting Beau one night at his house...only to be found the next morning on the beach by Margaret. As a mother, Margaret wants to protect her son at all costs, and she assumes Beau is responsible for Darby's death in some way, so she wants to cover it up to protect him. Darby had debts with some ""bookies"" who know about Darby's affair with Beau and come to collect from Margaret, assuming she will pay to protect her son and her family from a scandal, or Beau going to jail. Goran Visnjic plays Alek, one of the two bookies, who blackmails Margaret. With her husband at sea and in the dark about Beau being gay, Margaret is left to solve this mess on her own.

The film was shot on location in Lake Tahoe and Reno, and the incredible deep blue lake is a character of its own within this drama. The photography by Giles Nuttgens is beautiful, with a natural feel that puts you right there in the movie. The soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film and helps build tension and emotion quietly. This movie grows on you as you get to know the characters and their emotions. I've enjoyed the subtlety of viewing this movie 3 or 4 times now and it is in my Top100 movie list. It's not a ""flashy"" Hollywood film, but that's what I like about it. It's in the vein of another favorite character-driven thriller movie of mine: Dead Calm (1989). It's not nearly as creepy and twisty as Dead Calm, but it has the same elements in a subtler way.

The trailer is not as representative of the brilliance of this movie as I think it could be. But that water droplet shot is awesome!",1286236800,,3101,4.433333333333334
1215151,3,B00000FYWR,"The dead bodies just continue to pile up here, but the cops never seem to catch on. No fingerpints? You'll have to suspend your disbelief to get through this silly genre exercise that revives a short story from the 1940s. It's an updated film noirish tale about a mom's desperate efforts to cover up what she mistakenly thinks is her gay 17-year-old son's involvement in a murder. Some suspense, but it's mostly kind of a laugh. Tilda Swinton is interesting, as usual.",1229731200,2,468,4.719512195121951
1215171,5,B00000FYWR,"Tilda Swinton has been overlooked for many years; here she's given another opportunity to show her acting chops, and many awards and nominations came her way. I rented this little indie film because of buzz I recalled about her performance, and I'm very happy I did. Without blabbing away too much, she's a mother who finds herself in a situation that she doesn't fully understand, and makes a lot of bad decisions. Things only get worse, and escalate,  and...well, Htchcock would've loved a script like this. Hitchcock aside, the writers and directors took a 1947 book, updated it a bit, and the result is a thoroughly satisfying suspense film that surpasses anything Hollywood has done in 30 years. Setting the film in Tahoe is a stroke of genius. Tilda Swinton avoids so many obvious acting cliches, providing a most mesmerizing portrayal of a woman in crisis. So much talk about the lack of great roles for women; Tilda blew 'em all away. There's able support from Goran Visjnik, playing a difficult role, bad guy who's questioning his destiny. The entire cast and crew of ""The Deep End"" deserves major praise. I can't believe I'm the first person to review this film. Good DVD extras, giving fine insight. Highly recommended.",1228953600,2,1230,4.885167464114833
1215172,4,B00000FYWR,"A mother raising her family mostly on her own while her husband is at sea for long spells, in an upper-middle class cottage on the shores of Lake Taho. Her self-absorbed son has been exploring his sexuality with a smarmy older man, and Mom intervenes in desperation. The smarm has a few too many and comes looking for his young paramour at the family home, with disastrous consequences that plunge Mom into even more desperate waters. Then things take a turn for the worse. This film isn't going to be on your ""top 100 of all time"" list, but it is a savvy effort with exceptional performances from the leads, great direction and craftful filming, top-notch editing, and decent script-writing. It has the feel of early Hitchcock with better film, and you'll find yourself returning to it every once in a while to refresh your memory of the fine performances by Vilnik and Swinton at their best. The score is haunting, and the scenery is too, despite the natural beauty of it all. The movie has a polish that belies its low-budget making, and despite the occasionally contrived events as Mom faces her dilemna, the movie is most satisfying. If you enjoy watching ""The 39 Steps"" every once in a while, you'll not be going off the deep end when you buy this - it's not an action-packed comicbook extravaganza, but a darned good flick for a quiet evening.",1208736000,,1350,4.652719665271967

Visnjic excels as the conflicted middle-man, but Barry is most memorable as an impatient, cold-blooded gangster. Even with momentary graphic sex and some violence, the film's dramatic tension derives from Swinton's character, and our appreciation of one mother's lonely, desperate predicament. Taut and suspenseful, ""The Deep End"" is not to be missed.",1185321600,,601,5.543478260869565

1215175,3,B00000FYWR,"This movie tends to be like the musical score that opens it and weaves through it - simultaneously haunting and irritating.

Deep End is essentially a two-character play, an intimate dance between a protective mother and her blackmailer. The haunting element is the unexpected, rare fondness that develops unspoken between these two. Their relationship is reminiscent of the saving tenderness and respect that grows between the characters played by Audrey Hepburn and Richard Crenna in Wait Until Dark.

We feel this blackmailer's inclination to be better than his deeds early on, when he is left briefly alone in his victim's house. We can see him being touched by the order and goodness of the home Margaret has made for her absentee husband and her son. It makes me ache to realize how seldom such quiet appreciation happens in real life. I can hardly imagine a door-to-door salesman being diverted from his strictly commercial manipulations by anything he sees in a house. How much less likely it is that a blackmailer would pause to be charmed by his victim. But then, that's the poetic license we go to movies to find.

The irritating part of the movie could be the result of a bad editing job. Parts of the movie seem to be missing. For the first quarter of the film, I was distracted by wondering who the older man living in the household was. I may have missed the explanation that he was a grandfather. However, I don't think the puzzling gaps in the relationship between the blackmailer and Margaret were due to my having missed anything. At one point, Margaret refers to the blackmailer's gambling debts. How did she know he even had a penchant for gambling? In the only meetings they presumably have, they are not shown exchanging much personal information at all. The viewer gets the feeling that some crucial scenes definitely got left on the cutting room floor.

This is too bad, because the main value of this movie lies in its delicate quality of blossoming in the shade. We would like to understand more of what lay at the root of the blackmailer's absorption with the person who started out to be only a job to him. Tilda Swinton, the actress who plays the role of mother, seems too spare and monochromatic to inspire such a reversal, without our seeing more of an interaction between the two.

However, the haunting, touching aspects of the film very much outweigh its lapses.

I hope we will get to see Goran Visnjic in more big-screen roles. He makes an indelible impression as a man whose shining impulses can't find expression in such a dull, opaque world.",1155686400,4,2581,4.75
1215176,3,B00000FYWR,"This movie cannot decide what it wants to be. I will say that it holds your focus though.

The overall effect is that of an overwrought, almost teenage in its sensibility, quasi-love story. Tilda Swinton is a REAL actress, but she's trying to turn a pile of **** into something honest and true.

Can't be done.

This movie is all too like the worst poetry of the romantics: over-worked, elevates too quickly, can't decide what genre it is. Nice watching the beautiful people though.",1136419200,2,482,4.714285714285714

The interior drama, the triple crossroads feelings in this mother, and the outer intrigue of the pressure exerted by the blackmail, plus a superb photography and good cast conform to my mind a film above the average.

The picture is far from being another explosions and special effect picture. It's a challenege to the viewer and maintains its force till the unexpecetd end.

1215178,5,B00000FYWR,"Jerzy Skolimowski wrote this after Polanski's 'Knife in the Water.' His first English language film is an excursion into the mind of a romantic, sexually repressed 15 year old boy (John Moulder-Brown) who is obsessed with a young woman (Jane Asher) who is an habituee of the Newford Bathhouse, where most of the film is shot. In this seedy, watery world, filled with the alienated and maladjusted who live only for sex and sport, the girl of his dreams does 'favors' for those willing to pay. Rebufing the boy's awkward advances, she encourages him to do as she does. Disgusted and fascinated by her apparent contradictions, he longs to take her away from what he conceives as a hellish place of degradation. Skolimowski exhibits real insight into aspects of British character and the film brilliantly shows the dark side of the 'swinging London' of the late 60s, full of foreboding, the imminence of moral collapse, and disenchantment with illusory hedonistic ideals. The young hero, despairing of success in his 'white knight' endeavor, finds pathetic and fleeting satisfaction for his longing with a cardboard cutout of his beloved, foreshadowing and symbolizing the ultimate end of innocence and the substitution of voyeurism and onanism to maintain the faded ideal of romantic love. With Polanski's 'Repulsion' a powerful antidote to adolescent notions of idealized love.",1118620800,2,1376,5.202702702702703

The story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children.  Intense, often suspensful and sometimes creepy, this is a keeper.

Swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve.  SHe is amazing to watch.  The rest of the cast is fine their roles, whether shady, clueless or sympathetic.

1215180,5,B00000FYWR,"The Deep End is one of my top ten favourite films of 2001. This moody, suspenseful and very intelligent suspense drama about a mother who finds herself in a terrifying situation with a couple of blackmailers is told with great subtletly and superb style.

Criticised by some as being logic free, I don't disagree that some plot turns are flawed (eg anyone disposing of a body would not do so in such shallow water. Why did the blackmailers presume that the main character could come up with $50,000.00 in less than 24 hours? etc)but the taut, effortless direction, inspired casting, elegant cinematography and surprising emotional depth make The Deep End a superior and absorbing tale with characters who are truly complex and interesting to watch.

The terrific performances only enhance the enjoyment as Tilda Swinton gives a masterly, fresh portrayal as Margaret Hall,  a good, dedicated mother who will do anything for her children and Goran Visnijic who adds a real humanity to his role of Alex Spera, a initially cold hearted blackmailer whose conscious starts to kick in when he fully realises what he is doing to Margaret and her family. Supporting actors are also solid and Raymond Barry is convincingly menacing in his two scenes as Spera's more vicious crime partner.

Oh, and Lake Tahoe looks absolutely stunning, a unique and extremely effective backdrop for this film' story. Excellent.",1104364800,2,1400,5.0476190476190474
1215208,4,B00000FYWR,"Ultimately THE DEEP END is about a mother's love...what she will do to protect her son, her family and their lives.  Tilda Swinton is excellent as Margaret Hall, a normal everyday housewife who juggles the usual maternal duties effectively, while her naval officer husband is out to sea.  Jonathan Tucker plays her son, Beau, who she discovers has been hanging out with an older guy at a gay club, and she asks the man to stop seeing her son.  Once the son finds out, though, he resents his mom's interference, and meets with his lover secretly in their boat house.  However, circumstances result in an altercation, and Beau runs off leaving a staggering boyfriend behind, who...well, I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie.

Tucker is effective as the closeted son, and Peter Donat does a nice turn as the children's grandfather.  Raymond J. Barry again turns in a creepy performance (see BEST MEN for more) as a blackmailer who plans to expose Beau's secret unless Tilda comes up with fifty thousand bucks.  His partner is played by Goren Visjnic (ER, Spartacus, Practical Magic), who finds himself sympathetic to his victim's plight.  Visjnic is certainly a handsome gentleman, but his performance is weak in a pivotal role; his accent doesn't help, either.  But due to Swinton's perfectly controlled performance, the movie doesn't cave in because of Visjnic.

There's some beautiful scenery and neat directorial touches, such as the drop of water through which we see Swinton enter the house and the neat fade from the real mountains of Lake Tahoe to the fake ones at a performance of Swan Lake.

A very good movie, with an outstanding performance.",1102723200,4,1668,4.900355871886121

But the strongest and most interesting one to me centres on the journey the handsome character played by Goran Visjnic makes from criminal to something of a rdeeming figure when he cannot effectively carry through the task assigned to him by his partner in the blackmailing strategy they have devised.  With an excellent music score, strong design characteristics, fine acting by all concerned, this is a very fine film indeed worthy reviewing from time to time.",1095984000,7,735,4.92741935483871

1215211,5,B00000FYWR,"I just recently watched The Deep End and I will say that It was time well spent as well as a piece of fine art.  I saw Tilda Swinton in Love Is The Devil and The War Zone and I thoght her acting was great in those movies, however I will say that she does even better in this movie.  I have seen Goran Visnjic in the TV series, ER playing a role of one of the doctors and I was surprised to see him in The Deep End meaning that I was completely unaware that he has done a movie project.  It was a nice surprise to see him in this movie.  I think both of them acted well together in thier roles.
This story is set in Nevada and the scenery is very beautiful.  I will also say that the theme, settings, plot and dialogue are excellent in this movie.  This movie holds the viewer's attention and the emotions run very high in this movie.  One can call this a drama as well as a thriller.  There are twists and turns in this movie.  I will say this is a definite edge-of-the-seat movie.
Tilda Swinton plays an ordinary, innocent and devoted housewife, Margaret, who is also a very loving Mom will do anything to protect her children no matter what.  She lives in a nice comfortable house with her children and father-in-law.  Margaret's husband spends a lot of time out of town because of his job.  Her house is located next to a lake.  Margaret's world is ideal except for one fact, someone in her family has a skeleton in their closet that cannot be revealed at any cost.  If this secret is exposed to the certain party, lives can be ruined permanently.  Margaret does everything to cover up the skeletons in the closet and the plan works perfectly and the cover up is perfect.  She now thinks she can breathe until a shady blackmailer, Alek (Goran Visnjic) from Las Vegas shows up at her house showing concrete proof that he knows her deep dark family secret.  He demands an exorbitant sum of cash to keep him from showing his evidence to anyone who this matter would be of concern to.  Alek is aware that she will not be able to come up with this amount of cash in such a short time, however he will not relent inspite of her begging and pleading.  Margaret tries every legal method to get the money as well as liquidating some of her accounts, however she is on a very strict time limit and she has no luck coming close to the sum of money that has been demanded.  Meantime, Alek is harassing the poor lady for the money and stating that he will go to the source that the secret will be useful to.  He calls her at all hours and keeps showing up at her house.  Nobody is aware of the predicament that Maragaret is in.  Alek still won't budge to her pleas.  He loves to play the casinoes in Las Vegas and hangs around a crowd of hard core criminals who mean business.  The surprises keep coming in the story and the plot keeps thickening.  I will not reveal anymore about the actual story in the movie, because I think one needs to watch it to see what happens.
I want to say that both of the main stars in the movie do an excellent job in this movie.  Tilda Swinton and Goran Visnjic both mold into their roles very well.  Both of them are very convincing in the roles that they play.  They actually become their characters in this movie.  In Tilsa Swinton's role, the viewer likes Margaret very much and feels sorry for her as well.  Goran Visnjic will scare you to a million pieces with his role as a ruthless blackmailer with the mastermind.  It is a surprise to see Mr. Visnjic make a transition from a role as a hard working doctor who makes charitable trips to Africa to a role of a potentially dangerous Las Vegas hoodlum.  I feel Tilda Swinton and Goran Visnjic shoud have won Oscars for The Deep End.  I am glad the movie industry discovered both of these talented stars as I have not seen such fine film acting for several years.  I wish I could personally reward both Tida Swinton and Goran Visnjic.  I hope to see them in more movies, even if they are not starring together.  I just don't know when they are in the movies.
I highly recommend this movie and I will say it is good entertainment as well as a movie that should become a classic as time goes on.",1076716800,2,4169,4.2515883100381195

There are however, several flaws in the plot, including why the mother didn't just call the cops in the first place.  We assume that it is because she wants to protect her son from murder charges, but with the broken railing and cause and time of death, the investigation should obviously yield the truth of what had happened.  If she thought her son had actually murdered the victim, *why* didn't she even mention it to him?

1215230,4,B00000FYWR,"The Deep End is a worthwhile drama/semi-thriller set in a welcoming Lake Tahoe suburb. There is an irrefutable water theme expressed with the insightful cinematography, which adds to the overall aesthetic quality of the scenery. The film is reminiscent of a British ""cozy mystery"" where a beautiful and often comforting town atmosphere acts as a buffer for an ugly or severe crime which threatens to disrupt the sanguinity of an otherwise peaceful town. The center of the setting of The Deep End is within Margaret's (the main character played by Tilda Swinton) house. She lives in a very traditional world with a military husband away on duty, and several bright, talented kids, whom she takes care of emphatically. The story begins with the revelation of Margaret's oldest son's hidden homosexual relationship. What follows is a suspicious, but accidental death of a shady character from Reno that is suspected to have had a special relationship with the son. The rest of the movie revolves around Margaret coming to terms with difficult situations and leading a secret life from her family and community. Though, The Deep End is not, in the strictest sense, a mystery. The genre is difficult to pin down, but it is perhaps in a similar category with Atom Egoyan's Exotica.
Margaret's character is the strongest aspect of the film. She is portrayed as a very traditional wife and mother who has apparently not had to make too many big decisions independently in her life. Though, as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that she is a very strong and very intense woman who seems to have an almost unhealthy self-sacrificing drive to keep secrets from her family in order to protect them. Her son is also a strong character in the film. He is frustratingly innocent at times, but emotionally perceptive and with the same drive to protect his family (mainly Margaret) throughout the film. The third main character is a thug-with-a-heart-of-gold type. He is played by Goran Visnjic, who does a good job expressing his character's conflicting emotions and agendas. All three characters, by the end of the movie, are likeable, and not without their flaws.
Overall, The Deep End is worth a viewing for those who are willing to sit through two hours of introverted suspense without laughing or crying: it is not funny or sad, but introspective, perhaps. The acting is spectacular. None of the leading actors are big stars and they do not seem to be afraid to act, rather than portray a designated personality like a lot of the familiar Hollywood faces.  The Deep End is an undeniably unique film, at the very least.",1043539200,2,2613,4.925170068027211

Unfortunately her performance is marred by the shortcomings of the film itself.  There are too many unexplained details such as how her blackmailer obtains incriminating evidence about her son and why he needs an accomplice to collect the money from her.  There are also some improbable situations such as the mother dumping the body into shallow water and the blackmailer turning  friendly, so overall the film doesn't make much sense.  To me part of the suspense of the film revolves around waiting for the writers to tie up the loose ends, but unfortunately this never happens.",1041552000,3,690,4.913793103448276
1215232,5,B00000FYWR,"Let's concede the main criticism of The Deep End right up front -- some plot elements are wildly arbitrary and improbable.  The crotchety old father-in-law exists only to trigger a pivotal moment in the movie.  And, yes, it is totally illogical for Tilda Swinton to dump the body where it will be found, but hey, without that decision, there's no movie!
Suspend your disbelief, however, and what you have here is a  wonderfully acted and thoroughly engrossing film.  Two scenes between Mom (Tilda Swinton) and the blackmailer (Goran Visnjic)--the first when he comes upon the emergency involving Mr. Crotchety and the second at the house's shoreline after she has missed a meeting with him -- turn both their relationship and the movie upside down.  In the hands of lesser actors, it wouldn't work; but with Swinton and, equally (because he must make the greater character change from coldly calculating to human), Visnjic, a viewer believes the transformation.
The beneficiary of Mom's cleanup, the gay son, remains clueless from start to finish.  Having early on lied to his mother, ""he's just a friend,"" when talking about his older lover, he cannot believe that is the truth when she says the same thing about the blackmailer.  Another fine moment comes when he tells the lover that Mom doesn't know about their relationship and the older man snorts, ""She knows...she's a mom, not a moron.""
Spectacular views of Lake Tahoe abound and, fitting to the title, water is a constant motif.  A bonus of the DVD is Anatomy of a Scene, in which the filmakers describe the complexities and numerous takes of the shoreline scene, making subsequent viewings all the more rewarding.
Know what you are getting into -- The Deep End is a melodrama from start to finish.  It is not filled with big ideas or entirely believeable.  It is an entertainment, a superbly constructed, filmed, and acted one.  Accepted on those terms, it merits a full five stars.",1040688000,6,1942,4.908256880733945

If the movie is slow, its intentional. What kind of life does a soccer Mom have anyway-a scheduled and rigid drudge. The fact that this woman can multitask on that level, keep her head on straight and think far into the future is the amazing facet of this film. Sure, she should be responsible and call the cops but that would ""out"" her talented son, perhaps ruin his relationship with his military father and have their family the talk of Tahoe.
Its a film about people on a higher level who occasionally come down and get ""dirty"" with marginal elements of society.
Its also about how the equilibrium of morality. A soccer Mom hides evidence and calmly disposes of a dead body. A musically talented, IVy league bound teenager has a gross realtionship with a predatory bar owner. A ""low-life"" collector rises up when confronted with the woman's dilemma and the power of the family. They go down, he rises up. They all meet on the morality plane somewhere near each other in the end.

1215234,3,B00000FYWR,"Despite the glowing accolades The Deep End garners as the darling of the Sundance Festival 2001, the unembellished movie cannot acquit itself from its incoherent and illogical slips at times. Yet what has mesmerized critics including Roger & Ebert is probably the dynamic performance of Tilda Swinton who clinches the psychological thriller part with her moral dilemmas and parental obligations conflicting with her anxiety for her closeted gay son. Even my cine-illiterate mother agrees that the movie is more of an exploration of mother-son relationship which is at times touching and poignant. The movie requires patience - which many of the commerical thriller fanatics have little of - and the impact of the vicarious fear comes only after the movie when you relive the horror of making one wrong turn leading to another. ER Veteran Goran Visjinic gives a memorable performance as an sympathetic money-extorting thug along with Josh Lucas as the murdered lover. It isn't every one's cup of tea but it is an interesting essay on the mother-son complex; how the son ends up comforting the mother with a protective streak. Swinton deserves every accolade she is getting with her subtle performance that provides the emotional gravitas that resonate deeper than the artful contrivance in the story.",1037923200,,1299,5.220095693779904

She plays an upper-middle class devoted mother who will do anything for her children's happiness, in this case her eldest son's. Her acting is so rich, subtle and restrained, showing the audience a ""real"" human being, with all the weaknesses, doubts and frailties, inherent to everyone of us.
This is a picture that deserves serious viewing, that is simply told, devoid of all the artificiality which usually surround this type of stories made-in-Hollywood.

(As area residents, we must add that we had trouble orienting ourselves and some of the directions seemed reversed in the film.)  This story of a mother's tender,protective love for her son and for all of her family, when faced with evil from without, is a tale with which every mother can identify.  Yet Tilda Swanson's character, Margaret, seems to make a series of wrong choices without thinking through the repercussions.  The moral ambiguity in ""The Deep End"" is troubling, and for this reason, I was left with a  bad taste in my mouth.  The film resembles ""In the Bedroom"" in the that sense.",1031443200,,692,4.773109243697479
1215268,5,B00000FYWR,"Usually, when you hear constant positive buzz about a film, it tends to let you down.  I felt that way about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""The English Patient"".  So when I kept reading glowing reviews of ""The Deep End"", I was hesitant to fall for them.  I expected it to be another disappointment.
I was wrong.
Ably directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, ""The Deep End"" is a lovely, atmospheric, domestic drama about the lengths to which a mother will go to protect her son.  When Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton, in a fine performance) finds the body of her teenage son's lover on the beach by her home, she reacts by dumping the body in the lake, and not telling anyone about it.  Soon, a dark, brooding man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic) appears, demanding money in exchange for a tape showing Margaret's son and the dead man.
From there, ""The Deep End"" takes many twists and turns (some believable, some a bit contrived).  Yet, it is essentially a simple tale, about the love between a mother and a son.  Tilda Swinton deserved an Oscar nomination for her haunting portrayal of a desperate mother.  Everything about ""The Deep End"" is wonderful, from the cinematography (Lake Tahoe has never looked so beautiful), to the music and performances.  This is one of those films that are little-known, but worth digging up.  It is rewarding to experience.",1029110400,2,1364,4.741525423728813

1215270,3,B00000FYWR,"Tilda Swinton received much-deserved critical accolades for her quietly desperate performance of a woman trying to protect her gay son. It isn't nearly as thrilling as some critics seem to suggest; in fact, it drags at times. Still, it is an unusual and intelligent movie.
The film itself actually relies much less on its action sequences than on the performances of its actors, most of which are good, but all of which pail in comparison to Swinton's work as Margaret. Though she makes absurd and dangerous decisions, her love for her son makes those decisions believable, even when she tries to protect him from murder charges by involving herself with criminals. Some gay viewers will flinch at the depiction of shady characters in a gay bar, but we all know that you can find shady characters anywhere.

1215271,5,B00000FYWR,"There is always room for legitimate difference of opinion, but many of the negative reviews of this film border on science fiction.  Many seem to be based either on fallacies or misunderstandings.  Let me mention this first.
Number one, some have claimed that this is a thriller without thrills.  Why would anyone think this is a thriller and that its purpose is to evoke thrills?  It is a suspense film, and while there are few thrills (nor were there meant to be), there is considerable suspense.  Negative reviews along this line try to define the film as being this or that, when in fact it is something, and then criticizing it because it doesn't conform to the fallacious definition.  So, no, this is not a thriller.
Two, the acting is superb, not bad.  Several reviews mention bad acting, but as a former actor and hard core movie buff, I can spot bad acting when it occurs, and it is not apparent in this film.  The film turns completely on Tilda Swinton's performance, and she is just stunning.  And for the few critics who criticize her because she is so serious and glum, this is blaming her for the fault, if indeed it is a fault, of playing the character as it is written.  Happy things do not happen to her in this movie, and to express anything other than abject desperation would be inappropriate.  When the movie came out, many felt that she would not merely be nominated for the Oscar, but would win it.  I agree that her performance should have garnered her an Oscar nomination.  She wasn't nominated, but it should be noted that she not only was nominated by a number of other awards organizations for her performance but also won several Best Actress awards.
Third, although this was not really the basis for criticism, several reviewers referred to it as a film noir.  It is not.  Not all suspense films are film noir, and this one lacked virtually every element that is constitutive of film noir.  The only element that it shares with film noir is the sense of moral ambiguity, but even that is lost when one realizes that the mother's actions are motivated almost entirely by a desire to care for her child.
Fourth, there is criticism of the way in which a gay character falls in love with Tilda Swinton's character.  First (and I verified this by rewatching the film), nowhere is it intimated that Alek is gay.  That is an presumption that some are reading into the film.  Nor is it exactly clear that he ""falls in love"" with her.  Nagle, Alek's business associate, when perplexed by his attempts to help her, asks him if he was having sex with her (he was not), we know that he is being utterly wrongheaded.  I would suggest that reviewers who see him as unambiguously falling in love with her as also wrongheaded.  Instead, I believe that Alek is placed in a position where he ceases to see her as a ""business opportunity,"" because of his need to help her revive her father-in-law when he suffers a heart attack, and begins to see her as a human being.  After she drives off in an ambulance, Alek looks around the house and sees photos that reveal an entirely different world, a kind of world that is completely closed off for him.  His actions, I believe, are not based on a love for her in a romantic sense, but a deep and profound affection for the quality of life that she has, and that he does not have.  There is, in the end, some emotional tension, but even if the movie had ended differently, I do not think that Alek would have attempted any kind of romantic entanglement.
Finally, whatever else one can say about this film, labeling it ""stupid"" or ""dumb"" is about as far off the mark as it is possible.  Instead, this movie is brimming with intelligence, and one of the marks of this is the fact that the more you think about it, there more thought it provokes.  It isn't like a truly dumb film that the more you think about it, you realize that it doesn't hold water, and conceptually disintegrates, putting an end to all thought.",1026000000,30,3968,4.513286713286713

1215273,4,B00000FYWR,"I can understand why some viewers might be disappointed with this movie - it's NOT a typical murder thriller (the ads might have portrayed it as such).  Ultimately, though, it's much better than the typical suspense film because of it's complex psychological undertones.
Tilda Swinton plays a mother of three whose husband is in the Marines and frequently away.  Her family is pretty idyllic, but she begins having problems with her oldest son, Beau.  He's a talented student and musician and seems to be questioning his sexuality.  His mother suspects that he is having an affair with a 30-year-old male nightclub owner.  She tries to end the affair by talking to the older boyfriend.  The next morning, she finds the boyfriend dead on the beach behind her house and suspects that he son had something to do with it.  Events spiral out of control from there, and admitedly, some of the situations are not entirely believable and a bit melodramatic.
Anchoring the movie is a superb, subtle performance by Tilda Swinton (she's best known from the movie ""Orlando"").  She's from the U.K., but portrays an American housewife more convincingly than most American actresses.  Her performance alone makes this movie worth seeing.  Other pluses include the breath-taking Lake Tahoe locations and sturdy direction.  Highly recommended to audiences looking for something a little deeper than the typical thriller.",1025222400,3,1403,5.163716814159292
1215274,3,B00000FYWR,"I was really cranked up to see this one.  This is one of those movies that gets acclaimed, but slips in and out of theatres and cable so fast you sometimes miss it.  Besides, Goran Visnjic is my wife's latest mental Boy Toy, so that helped get it prioritized for a viewing in our limited movie-viewing time.
On the good side, Tilda Swinton does deserve every bit of acclaim she got for the role.  She could have easily replace another Nicole Kidman ice-cold-man-manipulator role as an Oscar nominee, IMHO.  It can't be an easy task for a mother to walk into a male gay nightclub, ask for the owner, and tell him to stay away from her son.  She shows the fear as well as the determination well in doing this task.  When she also portrays to Visnjic, from the viewpoint of a soccer mom, exactly why it's tough for her to scrape all the money he wants to steal from her in such a short time, I would think it would be convincing to many a hardened criminal.
Goran Visnjic is also pretty good, as he has to portray a criminal with a potential change of heart.  This role could have easily been reduced to ""Ruthless People"", where the demands for the money keep getting reduced, but he strikes a good balance between uncertainty and his obligation to his superior.
Where it goes wrong, and unfortunately this is fairly big for me, is the ending.  Where we see this woman putting together a heroic effort to protect a son that probably doesn't deserve it, I was hoping that there would be some kind of triumphant ending brought about by her wits.  While not exactly a happy ending, my problem is that she gets aided plot devices we've seen too many times.

1215308,4,B00000FYWR,"The myriad effects of the natural instincts of a mother are at the heart of this film, which explores the positive aspects, as well as the inherent flaws of those same instincts.  The ways in which an ordinary person will react under extraordinary circumstances often produces results that are most inexplicable; and when it's a mother responding to a situation in which her son is involved, the results may, in fact, be absolutely incomprehensible.  And in such cases, decisions made quickly in the shadows of the subjective are often revealed as unconscionable in the cold light of objectivity, a scenario examined by writers/directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel, in their tension laced drama, ""The Deep End,"" starring Tilda Swinton.
 Margaret Hall (Swinton) lives with her family in a picturesque lakeside home in Tahoe City, Nevada; but her life is about to become less than that offered by her distinctive surroundings.  Her husband is away at sea on an extended tour of duty, and the care and responsibility of raising their three children has fallen to her.  And all is not well.  Her seventeen-year-old son, Beau (Jonathan Tucker), an aspiring musician who hopes to garner a scholarship to study music at college, has become involved with a man, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas) who owns a bar, The Deep End; and once she is aware of it, it's a situation of no little concern for a mother.
 For her son's welfare, Margaret knows that this relationship-- whatever the context-- must end, and she goes to Reese, insisting that he leave her son alone.  There is some question as to whether or not he agrees, but regardless, late that night he shows up at Margaret's home, where he entices Beau to come outside with him.  Things go badly, and by the next morning, Margaret is embroiled in a situation beyond her wildest nightmares.  Blinded by fear and concern for Beau, she does something out of character for any rational person, yet within the parameters established by the unconditional love of a mother for her son.  It's an act that brings more bad news to her doorstep, in the form of a man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic).  And it's the beginning of a series of events that will take her into places darker than any she has ever known.
 McGehee and Siegel adapted their screenplay from the novel ""The Blank Wall,"" by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, and it's a taut thriller, to be sure; but it is so singular of purpose that it decidedly becomes more of a character study that focuses on Margaret, and the effects of that natural bond between mother and son that provides the catalyst for her motivation and the impetus of her actions.  It's a story that clearly illustrates how even the most discerning individual (and most especially a mother) will abandon reason in the heat of the moment, giving way to the most primitive and basic instincts for survival that are inherently a part of the human condition.  And though MeGehee and Siegel maintain the tension of the situation throughout the film, it does wear a bit thin along the way, and at least one pivotal element of the plot is questionable, and strains the credibility of the overall story.  The real interest of the film, however, is the study of what the mother/son relationship is really all about, and how affecting it can be, especially under extreme circumstances.
 What really makes the film work, though, and what maintains interest, is the performance by Tilda Swinton as Margaret.  And it's quite a feat, given the fact that the emotional boundaries she is given to explore are somewhat limited, as the conflict begins even as the film begins, and Margaret is driven on and presented in an emotional state that gives her very little latitude in which to operate.  To her credit, however, Swinton finds all of the variables one could expect in what is basically a lone emotion, which encompasses concern and apprehension, and she conveys them admirably; it is, in fact, what keeps the film afloat.  Her portrayal of Margaret is subtle, concise and introspective, and most importantly, comes across quite naturally; all of which makes her character and her actions-- which on the surface and in the cold light of day may seem questionable-- convincing.
 As Alek, Goran Visnjic gives a solid performance, though it somewhat lacks the kind of emotional depth that could have made this character more than what it is.  Whether it is the way the character was written, or the way it was acted, there is an ambivalence to Alek that makes him less than believable.  He looks good on the surface, and Visnjic does have some nice touches, but he doesn't tap into the absolute credibility that he needs.  And it makes one aspect of the film seem a little too pat, as if the character is there merely as a means to an end, to help the story along and tidy up the resolution.  It's a minor weakness, not worthy of blame; suffice to say that something apparently was missed in the translation of the material from page to screen.  In retrospect, Visnjic does a good job with what he is given to work with.
 In a smaller, but pivotal role, Josh Lucas gives a good performance as Reese, creating a character that is repugnantly smarmy, a guy whose influence over one's son would be any mother's nightmare.  Lucas does exceptionally well in this regard, and with comparatively little screen time; he uses his time well, however, as it is the nature of his character more than anything else that gives credence to Margaret's actions.
 The supporting cast includes Peter Donat (Jack), Raymond J. Barry (Carlie), Tamara Hope (Paige) and Jordan Dorrance (Dylan).  As a thriller, this one has merit; but viewed as a character study/drama, ""The Deep End"" is even more engrossing.

Blackmail enters the picture when a man confronts the mother with an incriminating videotape of her son and the deceased, which he threatens to reveal if certain monetary demands aren't met.

(I mean, Tilda Swinton could have at least found a handy kelp bed or something that might have disguised the submerged body a little better.)
The character of the handsome extortionist was rather thinly drawn, as well, but I don't agree with the reviewers who think the teenage son should have been more open about the whole affair with his mother to start with. Wake Up Call: talking about sexual matters with your parents at that age is very awkward, probably especially so when you're gay and they're straight.

She is neither man nor woman in ""Orlando"" for example, and here, in this new release she proves why critics around the world consider her one of the finest actresses in film today.  Denied Oscar nominations for this and Orlando, the actress shines in an almost thankless role as a mother protecting her eldest son from a potentially disastrous situation that threatens his future.  When she discovers his boyfriend's body on a beach near her home, she goes to work, burying the evidence and taking great personal risks to protect her child from harm's way.

The theatres are full of horror films and frenzied, noisy thrillers, but few have the impact that THE DEEP END holds.  The undercurrents become more treasurable with repeated viewings.  Tilda Swinton, always reliably fine and in a performance that deserved all kudos for 2001, captures the blind fear of a mother who would do anything for her beloved son, even shield him from what she feels to be a case of murder.  A blackmailer (played with panache by Goran Visnjic) goes about his dirty work only to become involved in the plight of the victim.  The interplay of these two characters is extraordinarily subtle acting which makes their developing relationship all the more credible.  That such a series of nightmarish incidents could all emerge out of homophobia  - both from the son in question and from the world in general - brings us to the breaking point of simultaneous fear and rage and some of the most sensitive parental caring that has appeared on film.

Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel understand the power of melodrama and use it to full effect here. This is excellent adult entertainment.
Margaret [Swinton] discovers that her 17-year old son is having an affair with a much older man and tries to put a stop to it. She doesn't succeed. When she finds the man dead near the boathouse of the family's Lake Tahoe home, she assumes the worst and takes measures to assure that her son's promising future is not ruined. Everything she does, though, only causes her to go deeper and  deeper into a world of homicide and blackmail. The audience is draw into the story because it knows things Margaret and other characters don't.
Of special note are the coldly beautiful cinematography by Giles Nuttgens and the haunting musical score by Peter Nashel. The script is a fine one. Sure, there are too many coincidences and improbable happenings, but these things occur in virtually all movie thrillers.

It's not so memorable like his movies, but really keeps hitchcoks tradition of showing a regular person, with a boring life getting involved with a crime scene and challenges she/he would never face. The affair between Margaret and the blackmailer makes the film more powerful, beacuse it's something that stays under the lines, though it moves the film and takes control of the characters action.",1019174400,2,1058,4.693548387096774
1215349,2,B00000FYWR,"THE DEEP END

(USA - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Despite its intricate plot developments and sophisticated surface gloss, THE DEEP END - co-written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel as a belated follow-up to their well-received debut feature SUTURE (1993) - is more of a mood-piece than an outright thriller. Based on the novel 'The Blank Wall' by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding (filmed once before by Max Ophuls as THE RECKLESS MOMENT [1949]), THE DEEP END updates an old-fashioned story for modern sensibilities: Tilda Swinton (longtime favorite of the late Derek Jarman) plays the devoted mother of 'sensitive' teen Jonathan Tucker (SLEEPERS, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) who's just broken up with abusive boyfriend Josh Lucas (ALIVE, THE HULK) following a violent quarrel. After discovering Lucas' corpse in front of their beautiful lakeside house - he had stumbled drunkenly and was fatally impaled after parting company with Tucker - Swinton assumes that he was murdered, and she moves the body to another location, hoping to conceal her son's involvement in the 'crime'. When the body is later recovered by police, she's confronted and blackmailed by a handsome stranger (Goran Visjnic, ""ER"") who has evidence apparently linking Tucker to the victim...

In a Sundance Channel featurette which accompanied the original US DVD release, McGehee and Siegel compare their work to the films of Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, most notably MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION (1954) and TEA AND SYMPATHY (1956), but while THE DEEP END employs all the trappings of melodrama (multilayered story, clearly defined characters, corkscrew plot developments, etc.), it swaps the commercial artifice of those vintage potboilers for an altogether more subdued narrative style, allied to a range of intense, carefully modulated performances.

Swinton anchors the film as a dedicated parent who pays a heavy price for loving her son too much, while Visnjic smoulders beautifully as a would-be villain forced to re-evaluate his moral position when confronted by Swinton's desperate reaction to his demands. Production-wise, the movie is near-flawless: Giles Nuttgens' widescreen photography makes a virtue of the glorious Lake Tahoe settings, and Peter Nashel's haunting theme music loans the film an appropriately solemn tone from the outset. Too slow for mass appeal, too clever to be dismissed, THE DEEP END is very much an acquired taste.",1019174400,2,2470,5.47244094488189
1215350,5,B00000FYWR,"This is a fantastic film. Never once does it smack you over the head and inundate you with twists. Instead it slowly lures you in and holds on until it's over. If you're reading this review, chances are you already know what the film is about, since you have to pass the synopsis to get to this point. So the best thing for me to do is to give you an honest opinion and that is to see this movie. If you have the ability to use your brain, this film is for you. If not, scroll back to the top of the page and type in 'I Know What You Did Last Summer.'  Tilda Swinton is absolutely amazing, and Goran Visnjic is completely compelling. There is one close-up towards the end that will absolutely break your heart. And what is so great about it is that the movie doesn't pander to you, and that is why so many people don't like it. Sure the son is a jerk. But what teenager isn't? One reviewer has complained that the boy doesn't deserve what his mother does for him. And that reviewer is right. But Parental love is to never give up on your child and love them no matter what they do, or how they act. Swinton's character reacts to that instinct. Sure, what she does is inplausible and no one here would probably act the same way, but that's why it's a movie. Hitchcock wasn't plausible, but it is that inplausibility that draws you in and makes for a good movie. I implore you to see 'The Deep End', and come up with your own opinion. If you don't like it, 'Scooby-Doo' comes out this summer. If you do, consider yourself rewarded.",1019001600,6,1529,4.2184300341296925
1215351,1,B00000FYWR,"This plot didn't seem at all believeable and wasn't very interesting. Both the mother and son are idiots and -- if you actually watch the entire film (an unwelcome chore) -- you become infuriated at their inane and completely unsympathetic behavior as a family that specializes in NONcommunication. Swinton's character should be brought up on charges, not because she hid a body, but because any child who lived in a household with such an illogical and fragmented woman would either limp through life or cast off the family altogether.
When I think ""film noir,"" I usually think ""interesting characters"" or ""interesting plot,"" not ""mind-numbingly stupid characters who should be shot."" This movie attempts to cast the ""stupid"" definition on the entire genre, much like a sequel can occasionally be so bad that it taints your experience of the great movie that preceded it.",1018396800,12,872,5.104895104895105
1215352,2,B00000FYWR,"the two stars that i give to this film go entirely to Tilda Swinton (in a 5 star performance), who is simply phenomenal as Margaret Hall, a woman whose desperate actions in the face of extreme circumstances help altogether redefine our notions of a mother's love for her child. Swinton deserves all the more praise for the fact that she could even pull such a believable and, ultimately, heartbreaking performance from what is essentially a b-movie script with uninspired direction and altogether unimpressive supporting performances.
first off, it was impossible for me to sympathize with the plight of Margaret's son, Beau, because of the fact that Jonathan Tucker provides such a sniveling, pathetic portrayal that i actually had a difficult time believing he was worth all of his mother's effort. all he does in the film is whine and mope and blush like a pre-raphaelite maiden and stupidly cast off his mother's attempts at establishing some sort of meaningful rapport with him (and she makes some honest, real, and sensitive attempts). it is only at the end, after Margaret has been through absolute hell for him and back, that it suddenly begins to dawn on his brilliant little mind that she had been on his side all along. sure, sure, blame it on pig-headed adolescent teen angst if you will; perhaps i could have done the same if it wasn't for the fact that Tucker gives such a one-dimensional performance that obnoxiously screams, ""hey, look at me, the troubled and sensitive teen!"" without providing any of the depth to allow the character to resonate with us. this kid should really take some acting tips from Nick Stahl, who adds layers and layers of complexity to the similar ""sensitive young man"" he plays in ""In the Bedroom.""
and then there is the stunningly ludicrous plot development of Goran Visnjic's character -- you know, the one who threatens to expose Margaret's secret if she doesn't cough up a huge wad of dough -- actually falling in love with Margaret and, even more ridiculous, her actually returning his affections. i mean, sure, i realize that walking into a movie, i'm going to need to suspend disbelief to some extent, but come on, this is WAY too much for the filmmakers to ask. for Margaret to fall in love with the man who represents the greatest threat to her family's stability, the very threat that allows her to pull together the strength needed to act in the remarkable, if disturbing, ways she does, is to completely undermine the integrity of that strength.",1012780800,7,2500,4.843457943925234
1215353,4,B00000FYWR,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ENDING. IT SEEMED A LITTLE TOO DRAMATIC FOR MY TASTE. ""TILDA SWINTON"" DOES A VERY CONVINCING PERFORMANCE, SO DOES ""GORAN VISNIC"" THE MAN WHO PLAY'S THE BLACK-MAIL COLLECTOR. BUT I FELT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH TO BACK UP THE PLOT. THE HIGHLIGHT IN THE FILM FOR ME WAS WHEN ""TILDA, EXPLAINS HOW IT'S LIKE TO BE A MOTHER WITH RESPONSIBILITIES, HOW HARD IT IS TO COLLECT $50.000.

1215354,4,B00000FYWR,"The Deeep End is like A Simple Plan - a simple criminal scheme unravels, leading to ever more complicated coverups.
The movie examines the paradox of the tribal loyalty of a family whose members are so isolated from each other that they don't understand the others' deepest needs and desires.  Indeed, the parents' ignorance of their son's homosexuality sets the film in motion.  (The father is the most isolated character of all -- always out at sea in the navy.)  One comical example of this is when the mother tells her father-in-law that she needs some money and he gives her $80, thousands of dollars less than she needs, but she can't bring herself to tell him the truth.  Yet despite their ignorance of the real concerns of other family members, there is a deep and abiding love in the family that can lead them to make extreme sacrifices, as we witness in the mother's actions throughout the film.  Even as we shake our heads at the mother's reckless actions (hiding a potential homicide) and irresponsible parenting (not pushing to find out whether her son killed his gay lover), we empathize with her love and maternal protective instincts.
The camera loves Tilda Swinton, which is good, because you'll see a lot of closeups of her in this film. She gives an excellent performance of a quiet but tough-as-nails mother. Acting kudos must go to the son too.
The blackmailer-with-a-heart-of-gold angle stretches credulity. Here's a tough guy knee-deep in crime, and he suddenly turns soft? Perhaps we're to think that he has fallen in love with the mother, but this would be a disappointingly hackneyed plot device, and the film doesn't confirm the suspicion.  But if he's not in love with her, his motives are obscure.",1010188800,3,1726,4.8338983050847455
1215355,5,B00000FYWR,"This movie is for anyone looking for excellent acting and a compelling story about an ordinary, yet extraordinary, mother.  This is not for those who need car chases and explosions to enjoy a movie.  That is not to say that this movie is without violence.  It depicts violence and physical tension, but inflicted upon a normal family rather than upon members of a gang or the mob or any other group that violence usually follows.  The movie compells the viewer ask, ""What would I do if this happened to me?""
One thing to watch out for is the character development of the supporting actors.  The movie mainly involves a mother, her son and a blackmailer.  But, the writer and/or director take full advantage of the limited periods of the film depicting the other characters to give a full, believable picture of the family involved.
All in all, an enjoyable and quality movie.",1001289600,5,875,4.723684210526316
1215356,5,B00000FYWR,"Tilda Swinton never strikes a false note as her character spirals through ever-escalating crises.

1215378,3,B00000FYWR,"The beautiful scenery and sparkling waters of the Lake Tahoe/Reno area make a suitably ironic backdrop for the dark happenings in this film. Tilda Swinton plays a woman, a Navy wife busy taking care of her three children and father-in-law, whose life is shattered when her son's older, drunken lover is mysteriously killed on their property. She desperately attempts to cover up the crime and protect her son, while playing cat-and-mouse with a blackmailer (Goran Visnjic) who appears at her door with an incriminating videotape.
Swinton's terrific performance holds this film together--she projects despair, grief and gritty determination with equal skill. The ironic juxtaposition of everyday life with the nightmarish intrusions of murder and blackmail is telling as well: Swinton calling banks and credit-card companies to raise cash, shifting her car-pooling schedule so she can meet her extortionist. It's not quite enough to cover various holes in the plot that might have been less obvious in a 1940s film noir (of which this has the strong feel of a remake), but that are all too obvious here. There are also shifts in character and motivation midstream that are difficult to believe--scenes seem to have been cut that might better have been left in. Finally, another and less attractive remnant of an earlier era is the homophobia which underlies and drives much of the story--the viewer will have to make up his or her mind, but I for one was left wondering why on earth this film received so much laudatory gay press.",1000166400,4,1529,5.071428571428571
1215379,1,B00000FYWR,"I had never heard of this film. Unfortunately that changed when it was touted by my mother-in-law. She literally said that it was ""the best film ever made."" While I am used to her hyperbole, I figured there must be something there. There isn't. The reviews I read were mostly very favorable, giving the impression of a real tight gem of a thriller. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM! The acting in this film is atrocious - people will say its good because its quiet and sincere - but all we get is a generalized feeling from the actors of ""loneliness."" The script is terrible. What appears to be a consciously quiet and sparse film is exposed by an old man who mutters one inane comment after the next adding nothing to the plot or character development. THIS MOVIE IS NOT SUSPENSEFUL! NOR IS IT FUNNY OR CLEVER OR ANYTHING! It portrays gays as sex crazed child molesters, and women as ultimately totally dependent on men. There is no redeeming quality of this film except that it is less than two hours and takes place on Lake Tahoe.",1000080000,7,1020,4.489247311827957
1215380,2,B00000FYWR,"I thought Tilda Swanton's performance was decent while most of the other acting was flat. The son doesn't change expression from the beginning to the end of the film. We are just supposed to accept that he is a typical teenager, angry for no reason. This isn't a characer - it's a cardboard cut out. Same with Alec. His tone of voice is the same whether he is saying ""Give me the money"" or when he is supposed to be tender and apologizing. The movie was just fraught with inconsistency. If the extortionists knew about Darcy going to visit Beau, wouldn't it follow that other people at the club knew as well?
Aside from that though, the movie annoyed me for the most part because the entire plot hinged on the fact that the mother never had the conviction to stand up to her wimpy son and ask just what the hell happened. I felt no sympathy for the character of Beau. He just seemed like a spoiled brat to me. The mother should have demanded a certain amount of respect from him.
This movie wasn't a mystery...it wasn't ""eerie"" or ""creepy."" It was suspensful, at parts, but overall I thought it was vastly overrated.",1000080000,5,1116,4.4487804878048784
1215381,2,B00000FYWR,"Why this movie has been lauded to the skies by our elite critics is beyond my comprehension. Granted it's an exercise in neo-noir and hence not overly burdened with ideas or introspection. Unfortunately, it has inexcusable holes in basic character and action big enough for Lake Tahoe to flow through. One of them is the gay business, and this not for reasons of tolerance or homophobia. The boy in the film is only 17. He's been drinking (at the Deep End bar?) and having sex with a person the law might deem a pedophile, not a gay man. Is it probable that a post-modern suburban MOM would go to the bar with the wimpy request that the older man ""stay away from my son?"" Now it's true that she's a boomer and a yuppie. After all, her son plays water polo, and her daughter takes ballet. These are dead giveaways. But how much ""tolerance"" should we expect from her ?More probably, she'd try to get the bar closed down for serving minors and the older man arrested for statutory rape. Similarly, if she sought to reach her husband on a ship at sea, in these circumstances she certainly would say, ""Yes. It IS an emergency.""
Her reticence here is just another plot convenience, and a transparent one at that. Furthermore, the pacing for this draggy film, an alleged thriller, should be much faster, so one doesn't notice the absurdities. All in all, this film is just another variant, and an inferior one, of ""Fatal Attraction."" Once again, a suburban American MOM defends her dysfunctional home from outside predators.

David Siegel and Scott McGehee's film gives us fascinating characters, taut suspense and a story that is blessedly unpredictable. Tilda Swinton gives a performance of great subtlety and power as a Lake Tahoe housewife who takes bold action when she suspects her teenage son may have murdered his lowlife gay lover. She is matched by Jonathan Tucker, as the son, and by Goran Vishnijc as a blackmailer with a conscience. There have been many movies that have depicted evil infiltrating an ordinary family; the most famous is probably ""Shadow of a Doubt."" ""The Deep End"" isn't quite a masterpiece on that level, but it is still quite splendid. There are few films that exercise your goosebumps and your tear ducts equally, but ""The Deep End"" is one of them.",999129600,2,852,4.724832214765101
1215384,4,B00000FYWR,"Being willing to sacrifice oneself is a luxury that only the least connected among us can afford. In the THE DEEP END, a modern retelling of Max Ophuls' 1946 thriller THE RECKLESS MOMENT, Margaret Hall is a mother of three willing to to do whatever it takes to keep her family safe from the irrational forces that follow her teenage son home one night from a nightclub of ill repute. But mom, played with stoic intensity by Tilda Swinton, quickly learns that heroism doesn't fit on a calendar already packed with soccer practices, trumpet lessons, dance recitals and visits to the grocery store.
Superficially the story concerns bad luck. Noirish events are set in motion when Margaret tries to cover up the accidental death of her son's unsavory friend (Josh Lucas as a spookily playful predator). The next day a man with a dice tattoo on his neck knocks on her door and demands $50,000 to supress a videotape linking her son to the death, which police have ruled a homicide. The dramatic heart of the film concerns Mrs. Hall's dealings with the blackmailer, cagely played by Goran Visnjic, ER's Slavic heartthrob in a less soapy but perversely related role.
Taken at this level THE DEEP END is an eerie joy ride that may strike some as leaning a little heavily on coincidence. But the presence of Tilda Swinton indicates that more is going on here than melodrama. Ms. Swinton is a brilliant post-feminist actress whose work sheds light on paradoxes of femininity and female power.  Her earlier films include ORLANDO, in which she explored androgyny and immortality, and FEMALE PERVERSIONS, a Freudian critique of the feminist myth of ""having it all."" In THE DEEP END, Ms. Swinton's nuanced performance comments on motherhood as a source of both power and vulnerability. A woman may be willing to do anything for her son, as Margaret Hall clearly is, yet still be constrained by a ""glass ceiling"" of caregiving attachments that prevent her from achieving man-style success. In cinema, the latter typically means blowing the villains' brains out, something Margaret Hall might consider doing if she weren't so busy taking care of her kids and aging father-in-law.
THE DEEP END begins with Margaret confronting her son's homosexual lover and ends with a phone call from her husband, a Navy officer who throughout the film remains unreachable on an aircraft carrier ""somewhere in the mid-Atlantic."" Mr. Hall's conspicuous absence and his infirm father's burdensome presence amplify Margaret's predicament, showing how hollow the conventions of marriage and machismo can be. Near the end, Margaret seems as anxious about how her husband will take the news of their son's sexual identity as she is about blackmail and murder. In this mother's hour of need, men prove at best useless, at worst far more dangerous than bad luck, the consistent enemies of hearth and home.",999043200,7,2865,4.981210855949896

The movie depicts the torture one goes through once one starts weaving a web of deception. Story expert, Robert McKee describes how stories are about choices and the unexpected outcomes they produce. This is a great example of how choices change everything. Tilda Swanton did a great job portraying the angst and agony a parent going through tough choices. There are some nice twists and character arcs in this murder story and an ending that while not providing resolution, is, nonetheless, satisfying. It does include the most graphic depiction of male homosexual lovemaking I've ever seen in a mainstream movie, so it may not be something you want to take your teenager to see. On the other hand, it does give a clear message and lesson on the effects a teen experimenting then getting in trouble can have on a whole family (whether it is a minor having sex with an adult, using drugs, etc.) The film shows how profoundly a whole family can be affected by one teen's impulsive poor judgment.

Tilda Swinton's ""subtle"" performance is so stoic and wooden, that it is difficult to feel compassion for her character - a trait which is necessary for you to empathize with her plight throughout the film. Instead she comes across as a woman hopelessly disconnected with her family, unable to communicate with them even in times of emergency, and remarkably stupid. This is not a woman you feel sorry for as she creates as many problems for her family than resolves them.
