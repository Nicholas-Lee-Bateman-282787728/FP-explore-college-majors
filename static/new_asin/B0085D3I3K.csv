These are repackaged movies each in their blue plastic cases. The 5 movies along with a bonus photo book and a pack of photo cards are bundled in a nice hard cardboard box with the descriptive picture on one side. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not included in this set, but I already had that on blu ray, so this set fit my needs perfectly.

5132789,5,B0085D3I3K,"Literally, this is amazing because Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest film directors today, and all of his movies are in ONE BOX.

5132791,5,B0085D3I3K,"The important thing here to me is the movies. They all have their own separate case, but come in a cardboard holder grouping together. Personally I pitched it. Takes up space and is unnecessary. That and I'm weird and have my movie collection alphabetized.

The set also comes with a little booklet with stills from the movies. They are about postcard size and honestly, it's nothing special.

All five films are worth owning and all look excellent on bluray.

Even better is that they all have decent extras with them. I don't know whether some individual special additions have some extras that these are missing (I know Memento does at least), but these are not stripped down versions.

I was fortunate to grab this when it was on sale and was only like $20. Even at the price now, for these five films it is definitely a great set.",1380067200,,835,4.583892617449664
5132792,4,B0085D3I3K,"Comes with 5 films on 7 discs: Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, Dark Knight (2-Discs) and Inception (2-Discs). The advantage of this set is owning all of these great films in one place at an affordable price because the content is the same from the stand-alone Blu-Rays. There is no exclusive content in this package but it still comes with over 5 hours of extras (mostly Dark Knight and Inception). Nolan has only done an audio commentary for Memento as he doesn't seem to believe in them. There isn't a 2-4 hour long documentary on any of the films so a comprehensive making of the movies doc could make this collection even better. Deleted scenes and featurettes are good but not great. The real advantage is owning these great films in one place. Unlike most 5-pack sets you will want to watch each film multiple times.

Dark Knight Special Features:
Focus Points (HD, 65 minutes) - Behind the scenes footage.
Documentary: ""Batman Tech"" (HD, 45 minutes)
Documentary: ""Batman Unmasked"" (HD, 45 minutes) - Comic book historians, psychologists and criminologists discuss Batman.
Shorts: ""Gotham Tonight"" (HD, 46 minutes) - Six faux-Gotham newscasts.

Inception Special Features:
Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious (44 Min; HD): Joseph Gordon-Levitt and leading scientists take you to the cutting edge of dream research.
Inception: The Cobol Job (15 Min; HD): Comic prologue in full animation and motion: see the events that led to the beginning of the movie.
Jump Right Into the Action (44 Min; HD).

5132797,5,B0085D3I3K,"The movies themselves are fantastic. If you're familiar with Nolan's work, you know it. If you aren't, you'll be impressed.
When I bought the item, it was sold by Amazon and I paid $24.99 for it, a complete bargain.
In the back of ""The Dark Knight"" blu-ray disc cover, where the movie info is displayed, there's a great artwork: some words look as if they were scratched by the Joker, changing the meaning with the phrases, so it looks like Batman is the villain. It's a tiny detail, but so fun to notice and have it.
The stock photos are good. I'd choose different movie frames to  print, but these ones are OK.
There's two tiny things I didn't like: the disc covers are thinner, about 80% of the size of a regular DVD/Blu-ray disc cover. Of course, this is so you can have 5 discs + stock photos + booklet inside one box and save space, but, personally, I didn't like it. And the booklet with photos actually come inside the box, making it much smaller than I thought it was. These two things, I think, are so personal I couldn't lower the rate objectively. It is a 5-star product. The good stuff absolutely outweight these tiny details.
I ordered it from Brazil, and it arrived in less than 2 weeks.
For portuguese-speakers: all the movies have portuguese subtitles, except for Memento. None of them are dubbed in portuguese (thank God).",1359331200,,1340,4.537190082644628

5132810,4,B0085D3I3K,"Well, I have to say that I'm happy with this collection. I mean, isn't a COMPLETE collection but that was set very clear in the product description, so no complains about that. The discs for every movie is apparently the same edition if you buy it separately and they're pretty good with the features and quality, especially those with big special effects and action sequences. It really takes the advantage of blu-ray. And cost less than buy it one per one, so I think is a pretty good bargain.

Also, the special content of the collection is acceptable. I was expecting a little more, we're talking about Nolan, right? So, I expected a photo book with more information and insights like little secrets about the filming of this movies, but all you got is little phrases, and the pictures isn't very interesting either. I was expecting more a behind the scenes vibe, but you obtain regular photos found easily in google and the quality of the print is poor, also with the photo cards. I expected shiny, brilliant photos but this are far from shiny and full of noise, so about this part I'm very disappointed.

In short, is a really good bargain for all this incredible movies and the blu-ray editions are pretty good but definitely isn't a collective type of collection.",1354320000,,1271,4.695067264573991

5132831,5,B0085D3I3K,"Christopher Nolan is, by far, the greatest director of all time in my opinion. I love all of his movies but because my brother is moving out and taking all of these with him I was looking for a chance to buy them for myself. This box set is a great start to get back all my treasured Nolan films. But let's give a quick rundown.

Memento- My favorite movie of all time. Most unique directing ever. 10/10
Inception- 2nd favorite movie of all time. One of the best concepts of all time. 9.5/10
Batman Begins- Great movie. Love Cillian Murphy as scarecrow. Very well done. 8/10
The Dark Knight- Best Batman flick ever. Joker is fantastic and so is the rest of the movie. 9/10
Insomnia- Not written by Nolan, just directed, and it shows. But who doesn't love Robin Williams as a killer? 7.5/10

All this for $25? I'm in. The only gripe about this box set is no Prestige! I would have much rather of had that then Insomnia. Also need to get Following and Dark Knight Rises. But, like I said, this is a great start.

UPDATE: Just got in in and thought I would review the packaging. It is a hardcover box and the front flips open to the left which reveals screenshots from the inside. All the movies are individually packed with their own bluray cases on the right inside (Dark Knight and Inception come with an extra disc of bonus features). They slide out along with a art book with summary's of the movies a a few quotes from the cast and lines from the movies as well as a collection of screenshot cards from the movies (some really cool ones in there such as a closeup of scarecrow). I would say it has some pretty awesome packaging.",1350259200,12,1631,4.340983606557377

When I place an order and got my stuff I didn't find that coupon to be anywhere in box, or on plastic cover  sticker like it supposed to be. So I contacted Amazon.com stuff to get more detail on it, and see why I did't get what some people claim to get from exactly same buy. The answer I got was that Amazon does not have nor ever had any promotional bonuses such as $8.00 coupon vouchers for Dark Knight Rises. Buyers who looking to buy this product with $8.00 coupon don't buy it from Amazon, find some other retailer and do some research to make sure that package includes cash value ticket.",1344816000,,954,4.359550561797753

- Memento
- Insomnia
- Batman Begins
- The Dark Knight
- Inception

Each blu-ray is identical to the previous individual release in terms of video/audio quality and bonus features.
In total, this is a 7-Disc set (both ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" have two discs).

This set includes these exclusive bonus items:
- 10 collectible Art Cards
- Booklet containing info/photos from Nolan's films
- Outer box (measures approx. 7 x 5.5 x 3.5 inches - will fit on standard blu-ray/DVD shelf)

** As a director, Nolan has made three other films to date: ""Following"", ""The Prestige"", and ""The Dark Knight Rises"", but these are not included in this box set.",1344384000,16,1075,7.007462686567164
5132841,5,B0085D3I3K,This is a good collection of 5 Christopher Nolan blu ray movies.  It comes with a picture booklet describing and showing stills from the various films.  It also comes with postcards with some memorable scenes.  Greatprice for the entire collection.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Nolan's films.  Enjoy!,1343088000,,311,5.14
5132842,5,B0085D3I3K,"Included all 5 blue-Ray movies as advertised. This is such a great deal.
I didn't have any of these and wanted to see the Batman ones before I saw the 3rd movie.
Ordered via the free 5-10 day shipping and got it in 6 days including the 4th of July weekend so not slow at all.",1343001600,,275,3.9285714285714284
5132843,5,B0085D3I3K,"Firstly, when it comes to the ""quality"" of the films themselves, these 5 movies are amazing, even Insomnia. Unfortunately, this does not include The Prestige because Touchstone Pictures released it and WB can't touch it.

Anyway, you get 5 movies, all BluRay, and a hardcover booklet with some info and pics about all the movies, and a envelope with high quality card stocks with the same pictures found in the booklet.

In terms of packaging, it does its job. The extra booklet and cards are nice but nothing but extras. (Note: this does feature 8 dollars towards movie tickets for The Dark Knight Rises. Only works at participating theaters but all Santikos and Regal theatres should work.)

Overall, an amazing value for some really good movies.
Only downsides is that The Prestige wouldve been better instead of Insomnia, and Batman fans will unfortunately have to buy the inevitable Dark Knight Trilogy set.",1342656000,,912,4.9868421052631575
5132844,5,B0085D3I3K,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director. Now we get all of his best movies(except Prestige) in Blu-Ray along with a 36 page art book, 10 photo cards, and $8 off the Dark Knight Rises. The price is also very good($35 from Walmart).

Movies- All the movies are amazing! I haven't seen Insomnia or Memento, but Batman Begins, Dark Knight, and Inception are my favorite movies. Really excited for Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel(which he's producing)

Photos- The photo cards are nice, as well. There's not much i can say but there like post cards with pictures from each movie.

Art book-Very nice. Each page has quotes, behind the scenes pics, and summaries of each movie. There's 36 pages total.

Overall- A very good-priced, high quality collection for any fan of Christopher Nolan's movie. You also get $8 bucks off the Dark Knight Rises, as I said before.",1342310400,,862,4.76510067114094
5132845,5,B0085D3I3K,"Released a month before his latest film, ""The Dark Knight Rises"",  the Christopher Nolan Director's collection is a great way to witness the visual style of one of the foremost modern visionaries of film.  The collection includes the single disc Blu Ray versions of Momento, Insomnia, and Batman Begins, the two disc versions of The Dark Knight and Inception, a set of 10 photo print cards containing the director's favorite shots of his films, and a book summarizing each film with pictures of the best moments in action and directing.  Overall, the choices show the talent of Nolan in captiavating films.  If you don't already have 2 or more of these films on Blu Ray, it's an easy choice to pick up this set.  Getting an $8 coupon towards The Dark Knight Rises to see in theaters was a nice bonus.  Sure, it's capitalizing off of the hype of Nolan's most anticipated film yet, but what you get and the price you pay for it is well worth it.",1342051200,3,943,4.550295857988166
5132846,5,B0085D3I3K,"The 5 movies alone should be well worth the price of admission (That's like only paying 6 bucks per disc if you get this at the $30 price point!). The bonus booklet, photo cards, and collectors box are all very nice additions to the set as well, especially given the already incredible price point.

Beyond all of that, the real reason to adopt this box set early is the $8 movie cash that you get towards seeing The Dark Knight Rises.  It has to be used prior to Aug 5th, 2012, but if you were planning on seeing the movie anyway, you might as well grab this box set sooner rather than later!  That essentially makes it only about $22 - $25 bucks for the box set itself!

Again, all features of this collection are well worth the price of admission.",1341964800,,750,4.297872340425532
5132847,5,B0085D3I3K,"What a great box set to include into my collection of blu-rays!  The packaging is good, and the extras are really cool.  I thought I was only going to get the movies but they had a book and film still prints inside as well.  A welcome surprise.  Also the movies are great.",1341705600,,272,4.173076923076923
5132848,5,B0085D3I3K,It's been all said already before me. But I just can't help writing about this great collector's edition. Christopher Nolan it not only one of the best Hollywood directors these days but for some people he is actually a Messiah of Hollywood. I've just received my package and can honestly say that it's not only worth $30 but makes it a symbolic price. You get these 5 incredible movies almost for free! Apparently the best deal ever on Amazon. Buy it before they run out!,1341273600,,472,4.564705882352941
5132849,5,B0085D3I3K,"For $29.99, this blu-ray box set was an irresistible deal. Previously I had only seen two of the films listed in this set (Insomnia and Inception) and they were both quite excellent. I know the other three films are highly acclaimed so I'll be looking forward to watching those for the first time in the near future. If you didn't already own any of these films (like myself) then this is definitely a no brainer purchase. I could have personally done without the booklet and picture cards, though I understand these trinkets probably appeal to the hardcore film buffs/collectors. I am a film buff too, but I just don't see the purpose of cutting down more trees to add these little novelties that people will look at one time and probably never look at again. Also not having these items in box sets will help reduce costs. Lastly, I'd rather the book had been a brief history of Nolan's life as a director instead of just a short picture book, but whatever. The $8 ticket voucher for the Dark Knight Rises was another nice surprise in this set. Minus the $8 voucher, this set equals out to just $22! Or less than $5 per film. You won't find very many deals like this nowadays. 5 stars!",1340755200,,1187,4.5
5132850,5,B0085D3I3K,"Really good price for this set! I always have
enjoyed Christopher Nolan's films... too bad ""The Prestige""

Looking forward to watch the movies when I get this in mail!

Enjoy the set, y'all, that bought it for this awesome price! =)",1340668800,,279,4.791666666666667

I was actually impressed and liked it. The dvd's actually come in bluray cases, not some stupid sleeves or anything. A book with pictures and info about the movies is also included. MAYBE some more little things could've been added to sweeten the deal but it's a collection of 5 awesome DVD's packaged nicely and neatly with an extra photo book, so it's worth the money in my book if you like all of these movies.",1469491200,,555,4.450980392156863
8525508,5,B0085D3I3K,"Many film directors want to be the next Stanley Kubrick, but Nolan may be well on his way to creating his own legacy. Innovative, visionary, a storyteller with a keen sense of the medium Nolan has established himself as a sharp intellectual risk taker, be that small budget (Memento) or big (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception). This is a fine collection of most of his films, and a terrific gift for any one who doesn't own these movies already. It also comes with 36 page photo book and 10 collectible photo cards.",1467417600,,516,4.619565217391305
