8049150,5,B0007N1PJ0,"A ripoux is a crooked policeman.  The premise of the three Ripoux films is built around the relationship between the seasoned (and crooked) policeman Rene (Philippe Noiret) and the young and straight partner Francois (Thierry Lhermitte) with whom Rene is saddled.  The first film centerd around the attempted corruption of Francois by Rene.  This is the second entry in the series and Francois is not the arrow-straight policemen he was at the beginning.  The two men find trouble in the form of cops even more crooked than they are.  Honesty may not pay, as Rene often says, but there are limits.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DVD HAS NO ENGLISH FEATURES.  IT IS IN FRENCH WITH NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES OR DUBBING.
