7827367,5,6302538335,"I absolutely love this video!  It is very well done and wonderfully blends the music with the film.  If you love trolleys, you will love this.  I missed out on riding these great vehicles, but watching ""Trolley"" sure makes me want to take a time machine back into this fascinating era!  Well worth purchasing.",1242345600,,309,4.666666666666667
7827368,5,6302538335,"This is a fine, concise look at America a century ago, with rare footage and fascinating information. For Baby Boomers who want a glimpse of the lives of their great-grandparents, or for younger folks their great-great-grandparents, this is a good choice. Also worth a look is the PBS documentary ""1900"" which complements, rather than duplicates, ""Age of Hope"".",1181260800,,361,5.241379310344827
