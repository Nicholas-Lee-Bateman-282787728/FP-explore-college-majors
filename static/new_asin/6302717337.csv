500033,5,6302717337,"Based on the popular novel of the early Great Depression this is a rather unique tale of a cheap, corrupt political crook who becomes President of the United States- only to become possessed by the spirit of the archangel Gabriel. It is hinted at, that this is the same spirit that moved Abraham Lincoln.
The country in this tale is in deep crisis. Economic collapse has left millions unemployed- millions on the point of starvation. The political bosses cynically ignore the crisis. The military make plans to cut down the million unemployed men who start a great march on Washington. Crime bosses play on the corruption and misery to become still richer.
And then a spirit enters a President that has otherwise been the most inadequate of men, the most unworthy of stewards. In short order, the poor are fed, the unemployed are put back to work, the bosses are forced to resign, the military is forced to help, the crime bosses are lined up and shot, even the war-mongering nations of the world are forced into signing a Pax Americana at the threat of overwhelming American strength of arms.
Yes, this film does uncannily presage many actions of the Roosevelt administration from the Civilian Conservation Corps to the fireside chats. The death of the president at the moment of his greatest triumph over the Europeans is also here. Maybe, this was deliberate propaganda- or maybe not. In any case, I like it. May the spirit of Gabriel return to the White House soon....",1079222400,6,1472,4.799212598425197
500034,4,6302717337,"A crook becomes President and mysteriously reforms...Definitely a curiousity from the thirties: this is a bizarre but wholly fascinting film. Because of the honest performance of the great Walter Huston, this was a big springtime hit in 1933.  Much of the story first indicts the Republican administrations which had occupied the White House, notably that of Warren G. Harding's. Later on, it takes on the newly appointed personality of the Roosevelt adiministration: this wasn't a fluke: William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper czar, urged producer Wanger to put this on film. When Wanger - worried about what his boss, M-G-M mogul Mayer would say - Production chief Irving Thalberg replied ""Don't worry about him"".  At the time, Louis B. Mayer despised Roosevelt (although he later supported him) and wanted the film to be canned. But Mayer really didn't have the power to shelve the film.  Almost eerily, Huston is seen addressing the US via radio broadcasts: a preview of FDR's famed Fireside Chats! Enjoy!",1043712000,18,1009,5.177914110429448

500068,4,6302717337,"This film is probably the most insightful and direct depiction of the problems faced by America during the Great Depression.  What many people do not realize was during this time the average American was looking for a different option of government - the government we had was not working anymore.  Things were not getting better.  This is something that McCarthy and the HUAC committee did not understand, or more likely, simply ignored.  Communism could have been an answer.  Socialism.  Fascism.  Something.  Anything.  This film delves into all of that.  Here we have a President who is simultaneously savior/dictator/gangster.  This is not a work of realism, no, but it is a fascinating 'what if' nightmare/fairy tale (depending on your political slant).  There is a religious undercurrent, but it is not heavy-handed.  Walter Huston is strong and Franchot Tone is always fun to watch.  A strange film, but fascinating and highly recommended.",1434067200,,947,5.226666666666667

500073,1,6302717337,"I recently watched this film  a film I hadnt even been aware of until now  and I found it fascinating in a horrifying sort of way.  The film was financed by William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul, and depicts a president who falls into a coma after a car accident, and is visited by the Archangel Gabriel while in his sickbed.  He is thereby transformed from a passive office holder, based clearly on Warren Harding, into a hard-charging leader, imbued with such determination and fire that he will let nothing stand in his way in transforming the nation for the good of the people.  President Hammond, played by Walter Huston, suspends the Constitution, ruthlessly wipes out corruption and revives the economy through a national socialist agenda (yes, national socialist, i.e. fascist, which is what the Nazis were, and which is precisely the economic program the movie suggests as necessary). When Congress tries to impeach him, he dissolves Congress.

What fascinates me almost as much as the movie itself is the fact that the only ones Ive seen criticizing it for the ominous totalitarianism it promotes do so by attempting to link it to conservatives today.  On IMDB there is a post saying Bush must have loved this movie.  On Amazon, a user review labels it a Conservative/Religious Right/Fascist Wet Dream.  Ive got news for these people: this was a movie and a message of the LEFT.  Hearst was a big supporter of FDR and the New Deal.  He actually sent the script to FDR and FDR suggested certain changes, which were incorporated into the finished movie.  Apart from the plot mechanism of having the Archangel Gabriel transform the protagonist, theres nothing of the religious, right or otherwise, in this movie at all, and conservatives or libertarians, who want to preserve constitutional, limited government would be last ones to support a program like this.

On the other hand, there was a lot of support from the left for this kind of idea back when the movie was made.  Its no surprise; fascism, national socialism, was a movement of the left, advocating government regulation and control of privately owned business.  And back when this movie was made, before the Second World War and the Holocaust, revealed the evils of fascism in stark relief, for all the world to see, a lot of the left-leaning intelligentsia in the democratic countries had much good to say about Mussolini, and even Hitler.  H. G. Wells, the famous author, was also a devout socialist, who said in 1932 that progressives must become liberal fascists and enlightened Nazis. Regarding totalitarianism, he stated: I have never been able to escape altogether from its relentless logic.  The poet Wallace Stevens pronounced himself pro-Mussolini personally.  Muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens said that Italian fascism made Western democracy, by comparison, look like a system run by petty persons with petty purposes.  NAACP co-founder W. E. B. DuBois saw National Socialism as a worthy model for economic organization. The establishment of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany, he wrote, had been absolutely necessary to get the state in order.  FDR adviser Rexford Guy Tugwell said of Italian fascism: It's the cleanest, neatest, most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen. It makes me envious.  New Republic editor George Soule, who avidly supported FDR, noted approvingly that the Roosevelt administration was trying out the economics of fascism.  George Bernard Shaw hailed Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini as the worlds great progressive leaders because they did things, unlike the leaders of those putrefying corpses called democracies.  After having visited Italy and interviewed Mussolini in 1926, the American humorist Will Rogers, said Im pretty high on that bird, speaking of Mussolini. Dictator form of government is the greatest form of government, Rogers wrote, that is, if you have the right dictator.  And thats just it.  All these people who imagine dictatorship would be just dandy because you can just cut through all the red tape and get things done, always, ALWAYS imagine that they will, somehow, have the right dictator.

History suggests otherwise.  Sure, from time to time, you will get a Marcus Aurelius, an ideal, wise, benevolent, philosopher-king.  But more often, the evidence indicates, you will get a Caligula, a Nero, a Commodus.  Thats why our founding fathers tried so hard to avoid precisely what these progressives want: power concentrated in the hands of a strong man who will get things done.  They realized that that kind of power would inevitably be abused.  The leader in charge now might possibly use his power wisely and virtuously, but what about all his successors?

And even those leaders who appeared to so many to be wise and virtuous at the outset, often enough revealed their true natures before long.  Just a few short years after all those intellectuals sang the praises of Mussolini and Hitler, World War Two revealed those leaders to be monsters, who plunged the world into the most destructive war in human history, and caused the deaths of millions, precisely because virtually all restraint on their power had been removed, and there was nothing stopping them.

It shouldnt have taken such a stark example to warn these intellectuals about such dangers.  A reading of history should have been all that was needed.  History is choc a bloc with examples of leaders who abused their power, even when they had noble ideals.  The French Revolution provided one of the best examples of precisely their program as well: put the right people in charge, empower them to act for the good of the people, and remove all the legal impediments to enacting their program and voila you get the Reign of Terror, not a better society.  But the example of the Reign of Terror didn't educate the progressives then, they had to see World War Two played out, bloodily, before their eyes to get the message that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And todays intellectuals are no better.  Obamas job council chairman Jeffrey Immelt said The one thing that actually works, state run communism a bit may not be your cup of tea, but their government works.  UN climate chief Christiana Figueres praised communist China (the worlds top emitter of greenhouse gases) as doing it right as opposed to democracies, because its able to implement policies because its political system avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the U.S.

People like these scare me, because they prove the truth of what Santayana said: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  No matter how many bloody examples there are in our history of tyrants abusing power and destroying millions of human lives, there are those among us who, in order to achieve their short term political goals, stand ever ready to throw away the freedoms our ancestors bled for, because they are too arrogant and short sighted to see that once a dictator has the kind of power they dream of, he will inevitably use it, not just to get things done that they approve of, but for his own ends.

Edit: the saddest commentary on this review that I can think of, and one that may well be the epitaph of our constitutional order, is that this review has garnered more dislikes than likes, indicating that a majority of people would welcome a tyrant who can ""get things done"" as long as things are things they approve of.  Of course, it won't stop there, as history shows.  And once constitutional safeguards -- inconvenient as they often are -- are cast aside, tyrants will begin to ""get things done"" that these same people DON'T approve of.  But it will be too late by then.  As George Santayana said: ""Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""",1390953600,7,8056,4.990276738967839
500074,5,6302717337,fine production with much thought provoking stuff. Could only have been made during the US depression. And prior to their then harsh censorship laws . Strange how the problems facing the films characters are so similar to those facing us today. The answers that work in the film could well work in real life too. If fact I believe the thirties 'new deal'. Contained some of them. And they worked then. Of course the fear of Communism/Socialism then. Helped force the masters of repression to give ground. With this fear removed. At least for the time being. They now grind us ever further down. Refusing to stop until we stop them. Until this happy day.

500089,4,6302717337,"This is a true curiosity, a pre-code movie of a bizarre political fantasy.  I recommend it to anyone who loves films from the 1930s.

The angelic conversion plot is trivial; what makes this movie fascinating and horrifying are its simplistic, bare-knuckle, constitution-be-damned solutions to the country's problems.  I truly believe the image of a crusading President curing the nation's ills through overwhelming force and iron will was inspired by Hitler's recent elevation to the leadership of Germany.  The movie plays like a totalitarian dream before the nation awoke to the dangers of fascism and national socialism.

The only similar movie I can think of is THINGS TO COME (1936), with its idealistic image of benevolent scientists bring world peace through world domination.

Besides, any movie that includes the Mob executing a drive-by tommy gun attack on the White House is a must-see!!",1349136000,,898,5.288732394366197
500090,3,6302717337,"This film is really crazy, but never dull. A bland American president has a near-death experience which transforms him into the single-minded ""savior"" of America. While some will see it as simply fascist, its not quite that simple. Abraham Lincoln hangs over the film both symbolically and often visually. Rather than conventional fascism, the film pushes the idea of the simple man cutting through corruption to save the country in a crisis. In many ways, its a blueprint for an authentic American style fascism with historical and intellectual roots in America rather than simply being a copy of Italy or Germany in the 1930s. The fact that Walter Huston came to this role shortly after doing a film of Lincoln is also probably not coincidence.

The film deals with the various crisis points of 1931-1932. There is gang crime. There is the ""bonus army"". There is the problem of european debt repayment. There is unemployment.

He solves unemployment by dismissing congress and becoming a dictator which allows him to create a program of government public works jobs for all unemployed. He solves crime by repealing prohibition, forming something like the FBI and then declaring martial law which allows him to use military tribunals to bring justice to the terrorists.

In one of the stranger moments in a strange film, the gangsters appear to do a drive-by shooting on the white house.

After settling things in America, he goes to settle scores with the rest of the world. He basically summons all the leaders in the world to America and forces all the other nations in the world to disarm at gunpoint. The savings from disarmament will then be used by these nations to pay off their American debts from world war one.

And with utopia accomplished, President Hammond dies a Lincoln-esque (or Moses-esque or Caesar-esque) death whereupon we can assume that with all the problems solved, democracy will be restored.

The roots of the film are themselves rather strange. Its based somewhat on a book by an author who was a political minion of the British Prime Minister Lloyd George. That book (and its mindset) brought a British sense of flexible institutions in a crisis that doesn't really fit in the American system. The constitutional constraints of the American system didn't really apply in the British system.

The idea of the ""great simple man of the people"" who can push needed reform through his own will is very much in the spirit of Lloyd-George. The Lincoln aspects of the work, however, were added in the course of turning the book into a film and have obvious American sources.

The book had a different ending. After solving the international problem, Hammond moved on to begin to rewrite the constitution to ensure that his changes would become a permenant part of the system. He then is struck in the head during an assassination attempt after which he changes back to the man he was at the beginning of his term as president. Horrified at everything he has done, he prepares a plan to turn the clock back. But dies before he can take action.

As a film, its badly paced. The script is poorly written. The acting is about average for the era. Its not all that watchable but I gave it three stars for pure weirdness.

Its a very strange film. But its a very interesting film with lots of non-obvious political and historical subtext to it.",1347926400,2,3359,4.815972222222222
500091,4,6302717337,"When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, the Depression was so severe that there was among some Americans a longing for dictatorship, in the style of Mussolini. But Roosevelt put aside such fantasies and saved both Democracy and Capitalism. This film gives a strange picture of the hope for dictatorship on the eve of the Roosevelt administration. Once Hitler came to power and the real meaning of dictatorship became clearer, the film was withdrawn from circulation. Curious snapshot of a fantasy in a crisis.

500093,4,6302717337,"I really liked this movie because of the patriotic theme it had, that is, a president who was doing what's right for America instead of party or personal agenda. It is clear that makers of this film were in favor of a new deal with a benevolent dictator in the White House. I would be in favor of it if indeed God was calling the shots. However, we know that FDR did not have a hotline to heaven and created a vast overreach of government power. We also know that we now have men in office who would and have sold this country and native born Americans out for personal gain and power.

500094,5,6302717337,"When America was being buffeted by the one two three punch of organized crime, a depressed economy, and debts owed to America from the Great War, it seemed that the only way to maintain America as a functioning entity was to trash the constitution and give dictatorial powers to the right man who could use executive discretion as to when to surrender those powers when the reason for their being had vanished.  Now if this sounds like the vortex that spawned Julius Caesar and Adolf Hitler, then GABRIEL OVER THE RIGHT HOUSE reverberates with a warning that was probably not worried about too much back in 1933.  Director Gregory La Cava and media mogul William Randolph Hearst collaborated on the then current belief that that previous occupants of the White House, Coolidge and Hoover, were simply not up to the job, but FDR--that was a different story.  William Huston plays President Hammond as a man who starts out as corrupt but through a near divine intervention when he recovers from a car crash soon morphs in the first coming of Franklin Roosevelt. Hammond uses the constitution to subvert it.  He takes into his hands the entire apparatus of the government, first by using his considerable powers of rhetoric, then by bullying everyone else into accepting his fiats.  Huston begins as your typical Chicago style corrupt politician, then turns into a smooth talking socialist who sees that all must share equally from the same pot, finally turning into a fascist who is quite content to execute by firing squads all those who land in his military tribunals.  Americans then probably needed the assurance that help was right around the corner.  The irony is that in Germany at the same time another smooth talking politician tries much the same tactics.  The results of this latter politician's deeds now fill this movie with a more subtle, more insidious context.  GABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE is exactly the kind of gem that ought to be seen by anyone who fears that the promises of a fluid teleprompter reader hold the key to his nation's survival.",1270512000,5,2061,4.849002849002849
500095,4,6302717337,"The Great Depression may have been a devestating time in America otherwise a film like this could never have been produced.  I'm not going to mince any words-this is one of the strangest films I've ever seen!  The basic premise is a cynical president survives a near death experience by calling martial law and declaring himself the autonomous head of state so that he can cure all the ills of the nation  without  interference from the other branches.  Regardless of the benevolence of such a totalitarian government this kind of smacks of ""Triumph of the Will"".  The movie is based on a book  by Anonymous and methinks that Anonymous was off his or her meds when this was written.  I was looking for a tongue-and-cheek quality but there's a dead earnestness to the whole enterprise.  Oddly enough this was produced by MGM, biting the hand that feeds them I suppose.  Star Walter Huston, one of the great actors of the early talking era, delivers his lines with eery seriousness which adds to the bizarre nature of the affair.  I give the film four stars instead of three because it has a jaw-dropping quality to it not unlike the ""Springtime for Hitler"" segment of ""The Producers"".

500098,4,6302717337,"GABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE (1933)
directed by Gregory LaCava
approximately 1 hour 27 minutes

When Judson Hammond (played by Walter Huston) is sworn in as President of the United States, he is a mostly easy-going guy who cites his party's platform and leaves the most pressing problems to be solved locally.  After an auto accident, President Hammond awakes as a zealous new man who wants to work on behalf of the American people.  He has many ideas about the best ways to help the unemployed, but there's only one problem: the congress and his cabinet both think he's overstepped his authority as President.

This is no matter for Commander in Chief Hammond, who fires his cabinet and declares a state of national emergency in order to implement jobs programs.  With the constitution suspended, Hammond has free reign over the United States and can implement any program that he thinks will work.  His rationale is that he is accountable only to the American people who elected him and not old fashioned politicians. This movie is a strange historical curiosity as the authoritarian Hammond is cast in a heroic light.

I'm afraid that the people who want to make the main character into Bush or Obama have missed the most important lesson of the movie.  The issue is not with the specific policies or whether the person occupying the oval office is truly working on behalf of the people.  All of Hammond's aims are noble. Lowering unemployment, reducing organized crime and achieving world peace are all good things. The problem is that the executive branch has been given not just autonomy but supremacy over the other branches of government.  The president in this movie militarizes law enforcement, creates new departments at whim and intervenes in the affairs of other nations.  None of these things are part of his job description (read Article 2, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution for more details) yet they are all commonplace in modern America and have been for many years.

While he was less ambitious, I got the impression that the Jud Hammond understood the Constitution more before the accident!",1251676800,2,2111,4.915492957746479

Daisy died in 1995 and her diaries--unread until her death--were made into a book called ""Closest Companion,"" which is a treasure trove of FDR info.  Among the details: FDR told Daisy--in vague terms--about the Manhattan Project!

I reference ""Closest Companion"" because in it, Daisy tells about watching ""Gabriel Over the White House"" with FDR prior to his being inaugerated.  She says in her diary that she would like to see a President do the things that the President does in this film.

Nevermind that he may have overstepped Constitutional boundaries...the President in this movie does something about the problems being faced by America in 1932/33.

500100,5,6302717337,"I call this a precode in an unusual sense of the term. ""Precode"" usually drums up visions of movies like ""Baby Face"" and ""The Divorcee"" - films filled with sexually controversial situations and language for that period of time (1928-1934). However, precode was more than this. It also involved political ideas that were over the top and the existential doubts that made the fine horror films of Universal Studios in the early 30's. This film is definitely a political precode. The censors would have never allowed such a film to be released just 18 months later. At this point I quote Wikipedia, which gives some context for the film:

""Filmed during the 1932 presidential election on the orders of media magnate William Randolph Hearst, the film was intended to be an instructional guide for Franklin D. Roosevelt during his presidency. Hammond as he exists prior to his accident is an amalgamation of caricatures of Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover, Roosevelt's immediate predecessors. After his accident, he is Hearst's idealized image of the perfect president, the president he wanted Roosevelt to be.""

Hearst always had great sway at MGM, with him also directing the career of his mistress, Marion Davies, at that same studio. President Judd Hammond in his ""idealized"" form is much more of a fascist than a socialist, though, declaring martial law and putting people in charge of trials because they have a grudge against the defendant. It is also interesting that Pres. Hammond after his transformation not only has a new interest in the welfare of the citizens, but he is rendered sexually neutral, addressing his former mistress as Miss rather than by her first name. It is more like the old Judd Hammond is actually dead and that some supernatural being has possessed his body more than it seems that Hammond has had some kind of transformation of his world view.

This is a very interesting film that would make a great addition to Warner Home Video's ""Forbidden Hollywood"" series. I hope to see it on DVD soon along with an interesting commentary on the film in the context of the Great Depression and Hearst's political beliefs. Definitely recommended.

500102,4,6302717337,"...then by all means, check out this delightfully bizarre and obscure film.
Firstly, I want to stress my disappointment with the outrageously negative reviews that proceeded my post. It seems certain people can not separate a politically charged fantasy film from their current and modern perspectives concerning politics. They blast this harmless little film because of its content, never once commenting on the entertainment value as a movie. They write harshly against the film as a whole  because it goes against their personal political beliefs, yet, these same type of people will profusely praise films that deal with serial killers, drug addicts and thieves. Their negative words would be the equivalent of me saying ""Psycho"" (1960) is a horrible film because it's about a very disturbed killer, so do not watch Psycho. This attitude is really absurd, isn't it ?
Anyway, I highly suggest watching the great ""Psycho,"" and I would also suggest watching ""Gabriel Over the White House."" This happens to be a well acted and directed film that is so unique and refreshing, especially considering the fact that it was released in 1933. Of course, any intelligent viewer will detect shades of fascism and even a revenge mentality, but duh, this is only a movie and I never once felt like the film was promoting anything, but rather, simply trying to entertain. And it does just that, on several levels. The great Walter Huston is a treat, as usual, and Franchot Tone actually matches him, scene for scene. The supporting cast provides satisfying support, and the dialog in this film is intelligent and thought provoking.
Again, I can't stress enough how unique and offbeat this film is, so, if you are a classic hound thats always looking for an obscure delight, then do seek out this wonderful film.",1221523200,15,1800,5.0
500103,4,6302717337,"In the same way that Orson Wells' 1981 film ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow"" predicted 9/11 and H. G. Wells' 1936 ""The Shape of things to Come"" predicted the London blitz and World War 2, this political drama from 1933 eerily predicted the use of air power during WW2, a United Nations type conference, Bank Holidays, the repeal of prohibition, The New Deal, and the Fireside chats.

A lot of reality found its way in this film (whose plot has been ably described by the other posters). This film came out on the eve of Franklin Roosevelt's administration and shortly after the infamous Bonus March on Washington. Here, Walter Huston as superprez endorses the marchers (unlike what really happened) but much of the aftermath of the film accurately described the things to come under FDR.

History teachers will do well to show this to your classes and have a discussion. However, be warned that aside from the bit about the gangsters and their presidentailly endorsed execution, it is very slow moving and short on action, which means it won't have much appeal to non historians.

By the way, this really needs to be on DVD.",1175817600,2,1118,4.723076923076923
500104,1,6302717337,"This movie, despite its often hilarious moments (that are usually unintentional), serves well as a serious fantasy about what the consequences would be of having a President who was fundamentalist, born-again, and power hungry, and who would not stop at his attempts to seize total authority until he was running the country the way he wanted to. Wait, no, sorry, this isn't about the current president, this movie is from 1933.

But, how prophetic! One of the many ironies in the film is that the horn motif that shows up during the moments of ""divine intervention"" was lifted from the last movement of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 1 in C Minor. Brahms himself lifted it from a Swiss alphorn player. It's from a piece called ""High on the Mountain"" and is an alphorn melody that Brahms heard while hiking in the Rigi area of Switzerland. The irony here is that Brahms was a noted agnostic.

In sum a mixed bag, fun to watch, but also a little scary.

500105,5,6302717337,"I had a field day watching this great, socio-political themed movie, which was released at the peak of the Depression (1933) and which depicts the ""glorious"" events that took place in the story, when the just elected U.S. President's being is ""possessed"" by an ""angel"" of justice & peace.

It's an allegorical, unique photoplay, expertly directed by the great Gregory La Cava, with another mesmerizing performance by one of the greatest American actors of all-time, Mr. Walter Huston, as the President.

Franchot Tone and Karen Morley, two very fine actors that were under contract to MGM during this period, show their skill and wide acting range, giving Huston flawless support as the President's aides.

The sequences that take place at the U.S. Congress and during an International Confference aboard a big ship, are especially noteworthy.

Once again, since I watched it on TCM, thanks TCM for being one of the most cherished treasure-vaults of the Media and please Time Warner, release it on DVD!",1107302400,12,1002,5.091463414634147
500106,4,6302717337,"A somewhat bizarre Depression-era political drama, which transforms the Capra-style populist comedy into a grim, protofascist litany. And I don't use the term ""fascist"" lightly -- it's meant quite literally. Walter Huston stars as Judson Hammond, a newly elected Republican President, appropriately cynical and snugly placed in the pockets of big business, who faces the same challenges as Roosevelt did in '32, namely, the continuing misery of the Great Depression and the disaffection and anger of millions of working class poor. Hammond has no intention of meeting any of his lofty campaign promises, and sees the Presidency itself as a bit of a lark. An ardent isolationist, he even jeers at the congratulatory telegrams sent to him by other world leaders (""Siam? Where's that?"" he asks, in an early scene, prompting an easy comparison to our own geographically-challenged G.W. Bush, back in the days of the 2000 campaign...)
Everything changes, however, when Hammond has an automobile-related brush with death, and comes back from the brink with a newfound commitment to saving his fellow man. Initially his impulses are markedly Rooseveltian -- he asks Congress to authorize a gigantic public works program to get the working poor back on their feet, and fires any of his old cronies who object. Faced with a backlash from his own party, and legislative opposition in Congress, he counters the accusation that he seeks to become a tyrant by embracing the idea, claiming that a benevolent dictatorship is more moral than neglecting the interests of ""the People."" Later, as he confronts an ongoing wave of gangster-related violence, Hammond takes a can-do attitude, and annihilates a Mob boss who won't buckle under... The scene in which the criminal kingpin is sentenced to die is spectacularly fascistic: Hammond's aide-de-camp (played by an under-used Franchot Tone), dressed in a gleaming military outfit, sits behind a huge Greco-Roman, art deco tribunal bench, and ardently praises Hammond's ability to ""cut through the red tape of legal procedures and get back to the first principles -- an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life."" Finally, Hammond uses a gigantic display of American military power to blackmail and intimidate the other nations into disarming, summoning an apocalyptic (and sadly, somewhat prophetic) vision of the horrors that await the world if the arms race should continue.
The film is quite remarkable in its outright emulation of fascistic, authoritarian politics, and is unlike practically any other American political film of the era (which were much more prone to upholding the nation's fundamental democratic ideals). Still, it does capture the zeitgeist of the times -- the anxiety and desperation, the urge to find stability and salvation, and the fear of a renewed global war -- it just comes down on a side which didn't get much credence on this side of the Atlantic. Admittedly, this film is a dramatic failure -- for one thing, Huston was a horrid actor; and secondly the script is a bit brusque, talky and shrill -- but historically speaking, it's a fascinating document and deserves consideration in that regard. Those who see it as a parable for the New Deal are sadly mistaken, however -- I think the film's creators may have been far more enamored of Mussolini than they were of good old FDR, who actually did pull us back from the brink.",1083628800,12,3404,5.06951871657754

  A dispicable man is elected president, a puppet to his powerfull rich friends & the politicians of his party thet helped him get elected(Republican?). How this happens isn't made clear. MGM hated wasting time on exposition in it's movies. This president is totally corrupt cares nothing for the people except to exploit their misery & enrich his cronies.
  He suffers a life threatening injury & is visited by the arch-angel, Gabriel. This is a life changing experience & he becomes a changed man, taking on dictatorial powers. He feeds the starving masses, solves unemployment, wipes out organized crime & with the help of the military, forces peace on the rest of the world.
  There is a scene on the waterfront. He has gangland criminals lined up to be shot, without due process. The Statue of Liberty is framed in the background. Quite effective.",1079481600,3,1038,4.836158192090395

7829942,4,6302717337,"What are we to make of GABRIEL OVER THE WHITE HOUSE today? Walter Huston stars as a corrupt, self-serving politician who becomes President of the United States. It's business as usual until he's critically injured in a car accident. Given up for dead, he suddenly revives (with help from above we're led to believe hence the film's title) and proceeds to right America's (and ultimately the World's) wrongs by any means possible. He dissolves Congress because they won't take action on any of his initiatives, has criminals tried and executed by military courts, and finally uses America's military superiority to enforce World Peace. All of this 6 years before the outbreak of WW II.

This film was made in 1933 when the Great Depression was at its height and the New Deal was just getting underway. FDR had just been elected as had Adolph Hitler in Germany. The film was privately financed by William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for how FDR should run the country. FDR didn't take the hint but it would appear that Hitler did although he didn't have divine intervention and ultimately took the film's methods and its message to its extreme and horrifying conclusion. Although billed as a fantasy, much of what GABRIEL had to say came to pass in the 1930s and seems strangely relevant to how American politics are playing out today.

The director, Gregory La Cava, began his career as a cartoonist in the silent era before turning to live action films. He is best remembered today for MY MAN GODFREY (1936) and STAGE DOOR (1937). He was also a good friend and drinking companion of W.C. Fields. Walter Huston had played Abraham Lincoln for D.W. Griffith a few years earlier and his character is an amalgam of Lincoln and FDR. FDR reportedly loved the film and watched it several times. Although made by New Deal liberals, the movie is amazingly pro-Fascist which seems to be OK as long as you do the right things. A one-of-a-kind film that still has the power to polarize audiences.",1469750400,8,1986,4.770348837209302
