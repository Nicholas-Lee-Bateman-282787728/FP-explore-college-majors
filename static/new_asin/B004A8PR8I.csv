8419685,5,B004A8PR8I,"Saw this when it came out, I liked the movie and didn't think about it until the other day. A friend was asking about  a movie and could I remember the name, after telling me about the movie I told her it was called Paycheck. And after a few minutes I wanted to see it again, so I looked for it on Amazon. And sure enough found it in widescreen and full screen, bought the full screen version. After all why watch it in widescreen when you have a big screen TV. lol",1472947200,,465,4.0
8419686,4,B004A8PR8I,"Based on a Philip K. Dck short story, director John Woo's PAYCHECK is a breathlessly-paced paranoia sci-fier.

The central character is a high-tech engineer named Jennings (Affleck), He agrees to have his memory erased after a three-year project in which he creates (for a $92 million fee) a machine that can see the future of whomever is operating it.

No sooner does Jennings get paid but the millions disappear out of his bank account and now a team of assassins are out to kill him. Long-time pal Shorty (Giamatti), plus Rachel (Thurman), a lover he can no longer remember, and a mysterious manilla envelope that contains 20 seemingly innocent items (like a newspaper crossword puzzle, a pair of sunglasses, a paper clip, etc.) are the only weapons Jennings has to fight back with.

This exciting actioner has the requisite grand finale plus a happy post-trauma plot twist. Definitely worth seeing.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
