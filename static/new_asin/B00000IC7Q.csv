1221660,3,B00000IC7Q,"The Fighting Kentuckian, 1949 film

This story is based on an historical fact. Frenchmen who supported Napoleon were exiled from France, Congress gave them land in Alabama as homes. The militia march through town (perhaps for the Creek War). They are dressed in buckskins, not military uniforms (more serviceable and cheaper). [The militia elected their officers.] John Breen is arrested for a bar fight (he supported Henry Clay). The militia arrived just in time, they march off singing. They present arms to a general of Napoleon. There is a wrestling contest for a gallon of Jamaican rum, and a free-for-all. A bugle ends the fighting. There is a song for entertainment. That night John Breen is advised to march away by a woman who is promised to another. Willy stays to watch John. [Note that old-fashioned bath tub!]

John rides to a mansion to see Mademoiselle, but she isn't home to him. He visits a tavern and learns how things are. Can he learn surveying quickly? [It is important to measure land accurately.] The singer tells her story and warns John about Hayden, the local powerful man. We learn about his scheme to grab developed land! Someone shoots at Breen as a threat and wounds him. Willy gives advice to John. They arrive at a party to play the fiddle. Is there a sour note? John gets a warning from Randolph and an offer to go away. The French General speaks to John Breen about his plans and the need for Blake Randolphs help. The French Colonel asks for their land to be surveyed to check the boundaries. John overhears a conversation and learns about the land fraud. But the arrival of bad guys ends the conversation. John tells the General about the fraud. Breen isn't a surveyor. Willy rides for help.

The arrival of the Colonel saves Breen. The man who talked too much learns of the danger. Breen meets Florette, she refuses him. Thats the way it is. The French gather at the Generals house. There is a shooting and a chase [for action]. [Note the modern tire tracks on a dirt road.] Blake Randolph is also jailed. Will he be shot while trying to escape? John races after Hayden. The river men plan to attack the French settlers, horsemen against riflemen. Kentuckians ride to the battle in wagons. The river men ride off in retreat. And so there is a happy ending. [But what happened next?]

This is a rare film because of the amount of comedy in what is a Western movie even if set east of the Mississippi. It is different from the usual movies that featured John Wayne, but not too different. The political climate was different too (the French settlers). [I didn't know that.] There is a lot of US history that is censored from the schoolbooks, you have to search for it. The traditional Western dealt with the conflicts between big ranchers and small ranchers or homesteaders. Sometimes sheepmen too. There was always a love story added to round out its appeal, and often young children as well",1396396800,,2927,4.666666666666667

1221694,2,B00000IC7Q,"Don't expect any of ""The Duke""'s later and greater films on this 2 disc set! The 16 films here are all public domain and consist almost entirely of the Lone Star series of low budget B westerns Wayne made in the period 1933-1935, before John Ford gave him his big break in1939 with ""Stagecoach"". You also get Republic's ""Winds of the Wasteland"" from 1936 and the Favorite Films reissue of ""Born to the West"", re-titled ""Hell Town"" from 1937. These films are short, most running just under an hour and if you like B westerns or want to see what John Wayne did before he became a big star, you may find them fairly entertaining. Prints are anything but pristine but I'm not sure these things even exist in first class elements. Most are contrasty, detail lacking 16mm dupes but are in fact no better or no worse than other DVD releases of these films (and there are lots of them out there!)  that I've seen.

All 16 of these films are encoded by Mill Creek onto 2 single sided discs although the discs appear to be double sided. That's a lot of material to cram onto 2 discs (about 8 hours per disc) but I've seen worse replications with much less material on other discs. I picked up my copy from the Dollar Store which seems like a bargain but I wouldn't pay more than 2 or 3 times that for this package and definitely wouldn't get my hopes up high for stellar John Wayne material.

Some of these in this collection must be from the 30's, and sometimes it's hysterical to see horses galloping past without sound of hoofs clopping along.

But -- Hollywood was still learning it's ABC's when some of these were made -- so you get the bonus of not only seeing some of the earliest westerns, but also the simplicity of the storylines -- it forces you to focus closely on what is not always told upfront -- well worth the entertainment factor!

But don't trust my word as my grandfather and the Duke are old aquaintances from Yuma AZ. so my opinion is biased. You will have to buy them yourself and see.

1221775,2,B00000IC7Q,"The quality of this DVD is wildly bad NOT because as one reviewer put, the film prints are some 70 years old.

Those film prints are still fine. It's just terrible compression. The image is dark and blurry, you see the pixels. It's a bit like someone made DVD copies of VHS tapes. In other words, super cheap.

But, hey, I suppose if you get 20 films for $5, you can't complain. And it's not like you can't make out the story. Still, it would be nice if Amazon could at least acknowledge the low quality here.",1217289600,3,509,4.237113402061856
1221776,4,B00000IC7Q,"Unfortunately, I haven't watched any of these movies yet. Many of these movies were made prior to John Wayne becoming a star. Most of these were

1221777,1,B00000IC7Q,"I only saw two of these movies in the set.  The first is Angel and the Bad Man.  That was pretty cute basically, except the toss-away-your-weapons pacifist message - the Duke gives up guns for the Quaker girl - isn't one I agree with.  The second movie was McClintock.  The basic message seemed to be that women are irrational, verbally abusive nutcakes.  But no problem!
Just humilitate them in public, give them a hard spanking with some kind of metal instrument, (couldn't tell which kind) and they will transform into little obedient lambs. McClintock passses on his ""paddle"" to be used by his daughter's fiance.

On the other hand, the frequently drunk, carousing husband doesnt' show any remorse or signs of changing himself.

I am not going to watch the rest of the movies in this series.  But if McClintock is an example of what any of the others are like, I think this dvd set should be placed in the genre of ""Scary Stuff.""",1211068800,5,933,4.612121212121212
1221778,1,B00000IC7Q,"Many of these movies were not the best quality to begin with.

1221779,4,B00000IC7Q,"No, this is not Duke's 20 ""Best of"" collection.  But it is an insight to many of his early movies.  Although most are forgettable, they are enjoyable to watch.

Disc 1 starts well with ""Blue Steel"" and ""The Dawn Rider"", allowing you to see early movie making.  The remaining movies, and those bearing the Lone Star logo get a bit repetitive, and it might require most to use the fast forward in many scenes.

Disc 2 is also primarily Lone Star, but the first (""Hell Town"") and last (""Winds of the Wasteland"") are not, and are easily the best of the one-hour variety.  Don't skip these two.

Disc 3 starts out with two more Lone Star, but they might be the best two from that bunch.  Then we get some real treats.

""Angel and the Badman"" is a very good B&W feature that highlights the evolution from simple action of the earlier movies to real storytelling.  Following is ""McLintock"", which is a real hoot, the only color movie included.  It contains many familiar faces, many very young.  It's definately not politically correct, but great slapstick comedy.  These two movies alone are worth the price of the set.

The final ""movie"" isn't a movie, it a documentary about the westerns of John Ford.  Anyway, it's still enjoyable to watch.

An added bonus is over an hour of movie trailers of Wayne's.

Transfer quality is not great, but actually a better than I expected from the age of many of the movies, and low, low price.

Several reviewers have already pointed out that the movies here are abridged. Indeed, this can be annoying. For instance, those familiar with the original version of MCLINTOCK will recognize that a funny part had been edited out.

""The American West Of John Ford"" was a made for TV documentary about the legendary filmmaker, with alternating host duties carried out by Wayne, Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. Filmed on-site at Monument Valley, it's easy to see the long-established camaraderie among these actors as they reminisced with their former director about his production company and days gone by. Ford was clearly looking frail and on the decline, which undoubtedly prompted this retrospective tribute.

The balance of the box set are films made prior to the Duke's breakthrough picture, 1939's ""Stagecoach,"" his first collaboration with John Ford. These quickly-made three-reelers, once standard Saturday matinee fare, were often shown in pairs along with a serial chapter, a Three Stooges short and a few cartoons. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear...

All of the transfers are good and the packaging is really nice.  4 discs in a beautiful case.  Released by Platinum Disc.  I own this set and if you are looking to own some of The Duke's earlier work than this is the box set for you.  For less than a dollar a movie, the price is right, plus you can save alot of money from shopping the used selections.  I mostly buy from Amazons used sellers and trust it 100%.",1172448000,11,937,4.4226190476190474
1221855,5,B00000IC7Q,This is the type of classic that you can see why John Wayne became a household word. Lots of action and romance,1172102400,,111,4.090909090909091
1221856,4,B00000IC7Q,"I gave this set to my husband for Valentines day, he's a huge John Wayne fan. He was very happy with the set. He's looking forward to watching some of the movies he's not seen before.",1171843200,3,183,4.111111111111111
1221857,4,B00000IC7Q,"It was very interesting see all the old movies. Worth the cost just for

the Maureen O'Hara and Wayne movie!",1169942400,3,108,4.4
1221875,4,B00000IC7Q,Well If your looking for John Waynes 20 best you wouldn't find it here. you usually get what you pay for. But if you like John Wayne and you like old old westerns all are in the early 1930s this collection is not to bad. It does have McLintock and Angel and the Badman which are two good John Wayne movies. All in all a lot of John Wayne westerns,1168819200,7,346,3.9571428571428573
1221876,1,B00000IC7Q,Didnt like the color print of this DVD. It was black and white and the sound and color quality left alot to be desired. The Packaging was good though.,1168473600,,150,4.206896551724138
1221877,5,B00000IC7Q,The first thing that strikes you is how much John Wyane's stage presence stands out above the others. He is believable where everyone around him is wooden in performance. The second thing is that all these films were shot in two years. The backdrops and props all start to look familure after the first two videos. Worth watching if you like westerns.,1167782400,3,351,4.67741935483871
1221878,3,B00000IC7Q,"I'm a big fan of John Wayne and have now seen roughly 115 of his roughly 152 movies thanks to the additional four that I saw in this collection.  It's no secret that John Wayne became a greater actor beginning with his role in ""Stagecoach"".  His second time around with John Ford turned him from a Saturday afternoon B movie star to an actor worthy of the feature film.  Wayne wasn't bad in the sort of roles that this collection featured.  Indeed, he was the able rival of the likes of Hopalong Cassidy and Gene Autry (without the singing).  He might have retired into a status of a hero to pre-teen boys of a former generation.

Watching these movies is a reminder of that screen persona he had before stardom.  It's actually a pretty good collection with a couple of Westerns, a non-Westrern romance, and the complete serial of ""Shadow of the Eagle"".  It was ""Shadow of the Eagle"" that impressed me the most although not necessarily in a positive light.  I had previously seen the first 4 of 14 chapters of Wayne's ""The Three Musketeers"".  In the DVD I watched, each episode was introduced the way the audience would have seen it at the time; the introduction with the cast and characters, a recap of the story to date, and completing the episode with a cliffhanging situation.  In the presentation of ""Shadow of the Eagle"" everything was run together as though it were an uninterrupted movie.  Too bad, because, although I could generally tell where each segment might have ended, I was able to see the resolution to the crisis immediately appear on the screen.  It made for one LONG movie.  In the abbreviated version of ""The Three Musketeers"" I grew tired of the repeated intros.  In ""Shadow of the Eagle"" I became confused by everything happening so fast.  I couldn't tell who were the good guys and the bad guys (partly because that's what the writer wanted, partly because they all looked and acted alike).  I wondered how many times our hero could have been knocked cold and still get out of bed and chase the bad guys.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to understand this and, hopefully, come to appreciate that these hastily-made productions were meant to be seen one at a time and only on a weekly basis.  All in all, though, I'd still probably rate it as better than ""Rio Lobo"".",1166918400,,2290,4.582309582309582
1221879,5,B00000IC7Q,"People before you start crabbing about how cheesy the stunts are, the dialog forced blah blah blah---they are old freaking movies.  You cannot expect the picture to be perfect or to be along todays standard.  DUH, they are over 50 freaking years old!  Go get some other movies by other actors during the same time frame and you will see the exact same things that are ""wrong"" with these.  They are awesome movies and a recommend for any John Wayne fan!",1163030400,14,452,4.54320987654321
1221880,2,B00000IC7Q,"I found this and jumped on it. As already stated the Lone Star movies are old and they have not been restored. [Package says Digitally remastered] The worst thing is that they have been edited. Most [not all] of the run times are from 2 to 7 minutes short.  On a movie that last only 55 to 59 minutes that can change the movie. I bought this for RAINBOW VALLEY. This movie's original runtime was 52 minutes. On this DVD it runs 47 minutes.

If you are trying to collect the full movie pass this by. If you don't care and want to watch some classic Duke it's a good price.

Too bad they spent more on packaging it than they did on production.",1152921600,107,641,4.153225806451613
1221881,2,B00000IC7Q,"Black and white OLD, OLD, OLD movies.  ""The Duke"" looks like a kid!  These are like the first ""talkie"" movies, or something.  Quite odd, really.  There are limited sound effects, and no music to set the ""mood"". (It's amazing how much difference that subtle ""mood"" music makes!)  The stunts are cheesy, the dialog predictable and forced.  And the movies are SHORT - 55 minutes on some of 'em!

All that said, it *IS* John Wayne and if you know what you're getting into, for the price, these disks are a bargain.",1150675200,7,510,4.538461538461538
1221882,1,B00000IC7Q,these collection of the duke's early movies are not the best transfers out there. they are blury and the pops and lines in the picture and sound are really bad. check out other collections and you'll find better copies.,1145923200,23,219,4.641025641025641
1221883,4,B00000IC7Q,"For diehard John Wayne fans, this is a true treat.  20 movies for about .55 apiece.  Granted 18 of them are 'B' westerns from Lone Star that are at times cheesy.  But 2 are a couple of gems.  Angel and the Badman is the first John Wayne movie I ever saw and what made me want to watch more.  The other is McLintock, which is so politically incorrect regarding the roles of men and women for this day and age, but still is a hoot to watch.  The only caution I have is regarding the quality of the pictures.  I've watched a few of the earlier films in the package and in places the picture is bad, blurry, and jumpy.  But you have to realize that the films are over 70 years old now.  The fact that they are still available at all is fantastic.  If you're a casual fan, I would say this is not for you.  You'll get tired if you watch these films one after another of the same sets or the oddity of only one woman ever in town, who of course John always gets.  If you're a avid fan, you'll treasure them, blurry pictures and all.",1142812800,123,1026,4.0497512437810945
1221884,1,B00000IC7Q,i have over 150 of john wayne's movies and i will not buy a dvd that does not tell me what titles are on it! i do not care to duplicate my collection and will not even look at one that tells me nothing about it.,1127088000,,211,3.608695652173913
