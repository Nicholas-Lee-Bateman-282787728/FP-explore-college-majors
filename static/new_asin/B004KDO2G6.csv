The stereo sound is clean, but not audiophile quality: Typical to most  modern digital recordings: Almost no sound stage, and the little that there is is squeezed into the center. The violins get screechy and dry, and compared to a good analogue recording it sounds sterile. It is not that digital these days is all that bad. The technology has been getting better ever since the days of ""Perfect sound"" from the Sony Philips advertisements 25 years ago. Now we can download or buy HD music of better quality.
But the problem also resides in the way the recordings are made: If you look at the video you can see microphones hidden all around the various sections of the orchestra which will capture a close up sound of each instrument or group of instruments. The problem is that these microphones will hardly capture the ambient sound of the theater, and worse still, will not capture the differences in time delay and reflections from the walls and ceiling of the theater, which are vital to giving the human ear and brain the information necessary so as to locate where the sound is coming from. What is the use of playing in a beautifully acoustic theater, if the microphones do not capture the hall ambience? what do they do? Just add a little artificial reverberation since it sounds dry with no ambience.  I have an analogue recording of the Brahms violin concert recorded in 1955, just one year after stereo came out in 1954, and what a difference in sound stage. You can feel the size and acoustics of this hall. What is the main difference? This was recorded with only two microphones, carefully placed so as to capture all the low level details.
To make matters worse, in the copyright world, they have not allowed us audiophiles to extract more than 16 bits of information to send to our DACs for conversion. Instead it is down sampled by a cheap chip which doesn't improve things.
If you believe that mp3s and HD downloads of good old analogue recordings sound the same, enjoy your music. You are lucky. No need to spend money on better recordings or equipment.",1479600000,2,2229,4.654822335025381
8432722,5,B004KDO2G6,Abbado was one of our greatest conductors. This performance was moving and captured for all time.,1475452800,,97,5.125
8432723,5,B004KDO2G6,"This is a MUST HAVE blu-ray!!!!
This is the best version of the New World Symphony I have ever heard!!!!!!
Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic are GREAT!!!!!
PQ is wonderful, SQ is fantastic DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround, great and heaps of dynamic range.  Get it, you will love it.
My only negative, this is recorded in Palermo, Italy in an old opera house, lovely, great acoustics, and all.  BUT there are lots of shots of
its REALLY old ceiling all during the performance of the New World, which just doesn't go together AT ALL!!!!!!
Small complaint, this is an AWESOME performance and disc.
God Bless,

8432724,5,B004KDO2G6,Good to see the Maestro Abbado with this Dvorak ninth symphony. Superb.,1438473600,,71,5.0
8432725,5,B004KDO2G6,"From the elegant opera house Teatro Massimo of Palermo, Sicily, 2002 concert features the world-renowned Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, violinist Gil Shaham excellent and, in my opinion, one of the best dirctores of the world: Claudio Abbado in a performance of Johannes Brahms' Violin Concerto in D, Op. 77.

Also on the concert one of the most beloved works in the symphonic repertoire, Antonin Dvorak Symphony No. 9, ""From the New World"" and the dramatic overture to Giuseppe Verdi, Sicilian Vespers.

The image, cameras, sound and theater environment make this Blu-ray shed tears of emotion.
Proof of this is that at the end of the concert, a huge amount of flowers, applause and ""bravos"" make it look like you were there.

Surely one of the most amazing concert ever filmed.

I recommend Amazon customers that cant be deprived of your record library this magnificent production.
It is a tribute to Claudio, who died at 80 years old.
And remember: ""He defined this music as a matter of love.",1434585600,,995,4.940119760479042

8432727,5,B004KDO2G6,"We all get used to fine music making from this team - but this is one of the best. This was the final concert that Abbado gave with this orchestra as the chief conductor and the affection that the orchestra and Abbado shared with each other is quite evident throughout and the orchestra clearly rise to this very special occasion. The venue for this concert was Palermo in Italy so to some extent Abbado is playing to the home crowd and they love it with copious flowers raining down from the boxes and balconies at the end.

The Brahms violin concerto with Gil Shaham has come to be regarded as outstanding in a crowded market and is well able to be compared favourably with the best. A good forward momentum is maintained without any feeling of undue hurry. The playing of Shaham and the orchestra is fully sensitive to every nuance but this is done without undue expressive heaviness.

The Dvorak has the tremendous drive and spontaneity that you can get at some live concerts. As with the Brahms, there is a good forward momentum maintained but combined with sensitive playing from the orchestra and the soloists within the orchestra. This is a very exciting `live' experience.

The Verdi Overture encore maintains this excitement and this becomes to be a thrilling end to a particularly memorable event.

The whole concert is in good sound and with sympathetic camera work. The recording was made in 2002 and with genuine HD recording equipment. The producer, Paul Smaczny, had started using HD recording equipment since about 2000 and this results in crisp imaging and wide ranging sound presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. (Another example of genuine HD recording and dating from 2000 is the Wagner Ring as conceived and conducted by Maazel).

This recording has achieved considerable recognition as a special event over the intervening years. The DVD was a notable success but the Blu-ray edition adds significantly to that. Both options provide a deeply satisfying musical experience which should give purchasers equivalent pleasure. It seems totally reasonable to recommend this disc as being worth a full 5 stars therefore in either format.",1344902400,7,2148,4.9390581717451525
8432728,5,B004KDO2G6,"The Berlin Phil is conducted by Italian Abbado in his last performance with them,at the opera house, Teatro Massimo in Palermo. The Egmont overture opens the concert,with speedy tempi. Gil Shaham plays the Brahms violin concerto with passion and at one with Abbado. However, Itzhak Perlman plays with feeling in the same concerto, conducted by Barenboim in a DVD. Being friends they have a great understanding with each other. There is nothing to choose between Perlman and Shaham. Except the sound is better in this blu ray. The symphony no 9, New world by Dvorak, will not disappoint. As an encore Abbado plays the Verdi overture Les Vepres Siciliennes. The orchestra plays with feeling in this bluray.",1316736000,10,704,5.0256410256410255
8432729,4,B004KDO2G6,"I purchased this Blue Ray partly on the existing review that gave it 5 stars.  Artistically he is right.  It is and amazing performence.  The problem is that the source video is not done to todays standards.  This concert was recorded in 2002.  The blue ray seems to be a conversion from a lower definintion recording.  Also the audio is not up to speed when compared to more recent recordings.  It just isn't up to the quality of the following Blue Ray Concerts.

1.  Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, Achucarro, London Symphony
2.  Beethoven Piano Concertos, Barenboim, Staatskapelle Berlin
3.  Herbert von Karajan Memorial Concert, Ozawa, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Berliner Philharmoniker

I would definately recommend this recording.  It is an amazing performance.

However, I will only give it 4 stars due to the less than superior video and audio quality.",1306972800,36,850,5.0215827338129495
8432730,5,B004KDO2G6,"This is the best classical music video I have ever seen. It was one of those rare occasions where everything went right. These are the finest performances of these great and very familiar works that I've ever heard. Gil Shaham as absolutely amazing in the violin concerto, and Abbado and the orchestra are on top form throughout. The video direction is perfect, the picture is crystal-clear, and, most importantly, the sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a video recording. (Note: the brief travelogue about Palermo, included on the earlier 2005 DVD, is not included here.) This Blu-ray disc is a superb example of what the classical concert experience is all about. Bravo!",1306195200,13,682,4.939130434782609
