7005010,5,B00TEC7J22,Love this season. Loved the character development.,1429920000,,50,6.285714285714286
7005011,5,B00TEC7J22,I loved this season but I watched the whole thing this past weekend. I think if I saw it weekly it would have been slow moving and slightly boring but when watched almost like a movie it's actually very good. I liked it much better than season 3 and I'm looking forward to the 5th season.,1429660800,7,288,4.160714285714286
7005012,2,B00TEC7J22,"I might sound a bit harsh by stating this but this has got to be one of the worse seasons of Girls ever if not the absolute worse out of them all.

Season One and to a lesser degree season three were all very promising, however this season took all the hope out of this series. I have enjoyed the previous seasons of Girls, I never thought it was the greatest show on Earth regarding this subject but as a mini series it wasn't that bad. While some found the characters annoying and irritating, their selfishness and imperfections were exactly what drew me to them and ultimately to ever liking this show. It seemed realistic compared to other dramas on TV right now, no one is living in a mansion, no one is filthy rich, unemployed rather and living in shady apartments I loved that portrayal more than anything however it could only keep me intrigued for a short period of time, especially when the plot is off the charts ridiculous.

I hated this season's turn overs. Spoiler alert; First of all, the writers should really do something regarding Hannah's character. It seems like the older she gets, the harder it seems for her to make a right decision. Wither it's regarding her personal life or her professional one. It seems like she just doesn't want to settle down or lay a firm foundation for herself. The season starts by her going to Iowa, of course to develop her writing skills and while the first episode was great in that regard, seeing her take a new found path in her life that might possibly get here to accomplish her writing dreams the fantasy is short lived, because Hannah screws it up for herself yet again. Somehow she's unable to adjust in the middle west, to her new big house who's much fancier than any apartment she ever lived in, to her classmates, to the lifestyle everything! And so she decides to go to New York to see Adam who hasn't been texting her or contacting her and when she enters their apartment she's surprised to see him with a new girl. Turns out he broke up with her in his head the moment she left, and then moved on so quickly without even telling her.

Okay, that plot twist ruined the series for me, I understand Adam and Hannah's interactions at the end of last season might've hinted at a coming break up between them but I have no idea why the producers could've just handled their break up in a mature way instead of making it so childish and rude. The least Adam could've owed someone he cared about like Hannah was honesty, instead of leading her on like that. Keeping her hanging! So instead of just going back to Iowa she decides to quit her dream and instead go back to New York, with no job and her x douchebag and idiotic friends hanging around.

The other characters are growing annoying too, even more so. Everyone seems to back stab Hannah in one or another, everyone of the Girls seem to childish and stupid. The only character who's ever had an improvement was Ray. The rest were all incredibly annoying and deluded regarding everything in their lives. Even the new lover of Adam and her ex boyfriend as well as the new characters are all one dimensional and irritating to watch!

And don't even get me started on the bath pregnant scene what was that for? It seems this show has no intelligent plot to offer for its viewer so the writers are trying to keep us interested by watching scene after  scene of drama, irresponsible teacher - student behavior, cat fights, contrived break ups and yelling between its characters.

Sad but I think it's time this show gets new writers other than Lena Dunham and introduce a real plot for a change or maybe even make its characters improve instead of just using the shock factor on us.",1429488000,4,3693,4.49478390461997
7005013,5,B00TEC7J22,"...or maybe it's just that I'm now invested in the characters after watching their lives unfold in 3 compressed years.

If you are set to watch season 4, then you already know from the previous 3 seasons that:
 Girls is endowed with quality writing, actors, and production values.
 ""Relative to most comedies, it plays like anthropology."" (from Willa Paskin's Salon article)
 Girls can be both [1] intraindividually appreciated on more than one level and [2] appreciated by very different people for very different reasons.
 What started (for me, at least) in season 1 as ""let's laugh at the stupid things these young women do"" has by now turned into a genuine curiosity about their trajectories.

So why is season 4 the best yet? Here's a pretty much spoiler-free appraisal:
 While the show has previously taken some detours to outside of NYC, s4 throws Hannah into Iowa... think fish out of water. This was a brilliant idea from the screenwriters of Girls; speaking of writers, Hannah has some cringe-worthy interactions with some in Iowa.
 Without giving anything away, I can tell you that *finally* the fantastic four experience some personal growth in a meaningful sense. This becomes most clear in ep. 10 of the season.
 Desi continues as a recurring character. I love him because I would hate him if he were a real person in my life. ""Hate is such a strong word,"" you say. IRL, I've met one too many hippielike flakes resembling Desi. Would you rather hang out with Ray, or Desi? Time to pick a side.
 Shoshanna really shines in s4. She is actually becoming someone I wouldn't mind meeting if her character were a person... and who I wouldn't mind dating if like she could like stop saying ""like"" so frequently... and if I were 10 yrs younger...
 We meet the character ""Mimi-Rose"" in s4, who gives Hannah a new arch-frenemy. Great writing!
 As a science fiction geek, I was thrilled to see Zachary Quinto join Girls as a semi-recurring character. He is too funny. Unfortunately I can't stop seeing him as Sylar, which breaks me out of the spell that Girls normally puts me into.
 And the Most Annoying Character Of The Season award goes to... Marnie! Allison Williams is great, and I sincerely hope that she is not like her character (other than being able to sing, despite my personal loathing of that type of music)... I love Marnie in almost the same way that I ""love"" Desi...

Trivia fact 1: Did you know that the actor who portrays Ray is as smart in real life as he is in the show? Alex Karpovsky was working on a PhD at Oxford before his entertainment career.
Trivia fact 2: Adam Driver (Adam Sackler in the show) has a major role in the 7th Star Wars movie (The Force  Awakens) that is set for release at the end of this year.",1429488000,5,2741,4.622680412371134

And I LOVE the fact that with her body - not that of a super model --- is seen naked or in unflattering outfits a great deal of the time.

7005205,5,B00TEC7J22,"The only similarity between Sex and the City and GIRLS is the main cast has 4 females.  That's it.  Girls is so much better & fresher.  The writing is amazing and what a unique voice Lena Dunham has.  Sex and the City was formulaic and ended each episode using the same boring formula.  But back then, that's all we had so I watched and grinned where I was supposed to.  GIRLS is different in a oh-so-clever way.

I knew I had to pay attention when in a previous season's episode, Marnie threw her drink at Hanna and that was the end of the episode!  I was shocked because I was so used to ""the"" formula and what I just watched was not how most episodes are supposed to end.  Once I got over that shock, I could digest what happened and then I literally laughed out loud!

Therefore, if you like your comedy/drama to stick to a standard beginning, middle and an ending that ties everything up nice & tidy, then hang onto your hat because your whole world will turn upside down.  My suggestion is to enjoy the ride, raise your arms and fly to uncharted territory inside the creative mind of Lena Dunham.  Lucky for us,l she's a great writer!",1459987200,,1140,4.3254716981132075

7005317,5,B00TEC7J22,"Adam Driver is my fave part of this show. But, it is an interesting series...it's funny, has some really effecting moments and doesn't sugar-coat how real people interact...sometimes insensitively & then turn around and help their friends during crisis. Life is messy and hard and this series shows specifically what it can be like for this set of young Adults, trying to figure it all out. (Although, I do think Lena Dunham must have some sort of sexual fixation..because there are (for me anyway) an unnecessary over abundance of really graphic sex scenes, throughout all the seasons.  I think it could have been toned down & with nothing lost from the story, tbh!  I mean it is part of the character's ""stories"" but honestly, I think it's kinda over done.  Most girls, and definitely ones I know, do not behave in that manner nor have such a raunchy sex life. I'm all for girl power but, c'mon. But, I get that this is Dunham's take on the experience of these specific characters. Fave seasons were 1,3,4",1453420800,,1007,4.7102272727272725

7005358,2,B00TEC7J22,"Two stars is probably too low, because some of the scenes are very funny and perceptive. It's just that  this show seems too thrown together: ie. out of the blue Hanna's boyfriend gets a big time Broadway role and Hanna gets into Iowa workshop. I'm also not sure if these characters are deliberately  over the top unsympathetic and self defeating or if we are supposed to root for them.  Watching this show reminds me of the frustrstions of watching the constant mishaps of the Honeymooners. GIRLS just  doesn't come close to mean and sharp humor of shallow self absorbed characters  in something like Seinfeld...I just don't get what this sitcom wants to be.

Interesting and unique characters depict the young 20 something life (although some male characters seem to be older). Lena Dunham plays a precocious and unselfconscious young woman, determined to make a name for herself as a writer. The show, especially segments pertaining to Lena, lends a somewhat gritty reality to topics such as sex, writer's block, and self loathing. I forget Lena's character name now.. One can only imagine their are some parallels between the show and the writer's personal experience. Also co-written/produced with Judd Apatow.

7005454,4,B00TEC7J22,I'm not always sure why I can watch and rewatch this show. Some of the characters are annoying. But I really felt like there was more depth and complexity to this season. It could easily have been the last season as there are some closures with several plot lines but the renewed for Season 5 and I am glad. I love Jemima Kirke.,1435708800,,328,4.222222222222222
7005455,1,B00TEC7J22,Lena Dunham gives us a s***ty angsty mid to late 20's sex and the city rolled in dog s*** and topped with whiney bitch sprinkles. Judd Apatow must have owed her a favor or something. I would love nothing more than to vomit on this show.,1435622400,,236,4.1521739130434785

7005502,5,B00TEC7J22,"I hated this show when I watched the very first episode. I thought it was super depressing. Despite that first impression, I decided to give it a second chance and i""m glad that I did. Regardless of what you might think of the writer behind the show (Lena Dunham), I found the show hilarious, brutal and all around interesting to watch. Almost all of the characters are complete wrecks and none are very likable, but it's like watching a car crash - you just can't look away.",1432684800,,475,4.471264367816092

7005524,4,B00TEC7J22,"I have a ""love and hate"" relationship with this TV show, but I keep on watching after all. Sometimes things seem too unrealistic and I wonder if 20 something really go through all that kind of stuff. Even in those cases, it is a good reflection about our society these days, the high expectancy we have and how we put effort in things that are meant to fail. I like how they try to show as many different people as possible, but it seems like everybody is hipster and coll in the end of day. I take is a lesson about what not do to (yet again) and had fun watching almost all the time.",1431993600,,585,4.095652173913043

7005532,3,B00TEC7J22,"Girls is a guilty pleasure for sure. Subtract all the graphic sex and I might like this show a little more. The stories and characters are interesting, but this season was rather bland. *spoiler* Also, this season touched on the topic of abortion. I appreciated that they showed the male perspective and how emotionally hard it can be for men (especially when they aren't included in the decision) You could see the great loss he felt and all the dreams and love he had for the child he didn't even know. Ugh It made me cry.",1431043200,2,524,4.46875

Theoretically I should hate the show, but I watched every episode. That's because IT'S GOOD. It's not as good as Mad Men or Breaking Bad, but it's watchable. That sounds like faint praise, but it's not. There are very few shows that are watchable. Even the ones that are supposed to be good rarely live up to the hype. The writing on this show is very good, and the acting is decent. There are some good performances. It's entertaining. People who have never seen it think it's a political show, but it's not. It has no agenda. It's a show about young people trying to find their way in the world, and if you were ever young, you will recognize people you knew who could be selfish, flawed, conflicted, ambitious, ridiculous, petty, and greedy, while at times occasionally doing the right thing after they've exhausted every other possibility.",1518998400,,969,4.6725146198830405
