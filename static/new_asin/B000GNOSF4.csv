2615349,5,B000GNOSF4,"I was somewhat a skeptic of this movie- boy, was I wrong!  A compelling story line, rivetting scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Based on a true story, this movie will capture you.  A great cast who fit the characters very well.  A great addition to your movie collection.",1158883200,2,290,4.314814814814815
2615350,1,B000GNOSF4,"Okay.

4 star reviews are a bit much for a made for cable look alike, don't you think people.

What on earth is so terrifying about this film. The ghost in the woods.

If it weren't the CGI earth mother..yeah.

The crazy fella next door..if he weren't acting like he really didn't need to be in this movie..probably. See him in Dead Birds( helk of a more convincing performance.)

Okay..well heres the plot.

A couple complete with two daughters take up residence in a spooky town haunted by a past murder.

The shocking revelation comes toward the end when we realize that we paid $3.50 to rent this garbage.

I mean this movie was like watching the Young and the Restless Halloween Special.

The plot has been played out people. Past Life interfering with modern day woes. Give us something a little more original next time.

The actress who played Lucy Keyes mother was quite good and seemed as if she really wanted to make something of her role.

Unfortunately, the plot downgraded this and left me wanting her to star in a better movie.

Be warned. If you buy this flick looking for some good ghost scares..the ghost is hardly featured and the supernatural doings take a back seat to the odd town characters that we could not give two sticks about.

At the end of this 2 hour soap the viewer(us) is left with a cautionary tale of moving into small towns with a past. We just wish the past was a little more interesting.",1158710400,3,1424,4.494163424124514
2615351,1,B000GNOSF4,"The Legend of Lucy Keyes, when I checked it out at the video store, looks promising. It even has a ""Winner Audience Award Independent Film Festival of Boston"".

I though the entire movie sucked.

(1) The kids were not acting, but whiney the whole time. It grated on my nerves like fingernails against a chalkboard. Constantly whiney whiney whiney.

(2) The parents' acting was very bad, I thought. They too were whiney and got on my last nerve.

(3) There was not much of a story in it. Other than irritating the daylights out of me, it was incredibly boring. Where was the suspese? AT WHAT POINT WAS IT SCAREY????  If this movie scares you, so would the cartoon Casper. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING IF THIS IS SCAREY. It's BAD.

I thought it a kind of cheap water downed imitation of the movie Poltergeist, which was an awesome movie.

I'm just giving you my honest opinion. It was boring, grating on my nerves, and not once ounce of scarey in it. B O R I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!

BAD!!!!!!!!!!",1158710400,4,981,4.441340782122905
2615352,5,B000GNOSF4,"First, I must confess that my opinion is biased by the fact that I appear as an extra in the two town meeting scenes in the film.  I was aware of the general plot but had no idea how the story would actually be dveloped.  Needless to say, I could not wait to see the film and I was not disappointed.  The story on which the film was based was quite faithfully portrayed by the cast and the picturesque surrounding of the Wachusett Mountain area of Massachusetts was done justice by the excellent cinematography.  In all, it's a great ghost story.",1157673600,4,546,4.376237623762377
2615353,5,B000GNOSF4,"Being a big fan of Urban & Rural Legend, when I read about The Legend of Lucy Keyes- I knew I had to see this movie. The movie is about a family who moves from the big city to the confines of a small New England town. Little do they know that their new home once belonged to the Keyes family, a family who experienced the great loss of their daughter some 250 years ago. Based on the true story of Lucy Keyes, this 'independent' psychological thriller delivers the goods in some ways better than those films made in Hollywood. I loved it. John Stimpson directs, with an all-star cast with the likes of Brooke Adams, Justin Theroux, Julie Delpy, and Mark Boone Junior.

If you're looking for a good movie to watch during Halloween- this is, definitely, one to watch.

2615364,5,B000GNOSF4,"Truly good ghost story. I like the way it builds up from a normal (though grieving) family moving to a new place, slowly with more & more tension until it gets into the real ghost part.
All the actors are excellent. Brooke Adams shines as the pushy business woman out to get her way. Julie Delpy is great as the mother of Lucy & Molly. The father (Justin Therox) is quite serious & fine. Mark Boone Junior is absolutely terrifying as the mean, haunted neighbor. But it is Cassidy Hinkle as Lucy who is so endearing & real. What a great child actor.

2615368,5,B000GNOSF4,"Most excellent!  This is a riveting story, the acting is awesome and the story is really well told.  A refreshing change from the usual drivel that makes up the library of ""free"" movies.  A young couple with two kids buy a farm to start a new job and a new life.  A terrible tragedy lies in their past and, although the story doesn't center around it, it does reference it a few times. The characters are colorful, well-acted, the plot twists aren't really twists but more of a revelation of another part of a mystery, and the ending is very climactic and most satisfying.",1508457600,2,572,4.471153846153846

2615391,4,B000GNOSF4,"This is a movie I have seen a number of times and ordered it because I know I will watch it again.  I like horror movies but dislike the gore of the typical R-rated movie.  This is suspenseful, has some historical background and takes place in New England, which is the next best thing to taking place in Britain, in my opinion.  I would have rated it higher, but it is not Shakespeare.  However, if horror movies are your thing and you don't want one which will burn images on your brain that you wish would wash out, this may be good for you.  The youngest child was cute, the adults acted well and, even though I have watched it many times, it still holds my interest.",1354060800,2,671,4.251968503937008
2615392,3,B000GNOSF4,"Overall a pretty good movie, though it had some slow areas in the story and not much money for Visual Effects.
The movie follows a city family, husband and wife and their two young daughters, who recently moves to the country because the husband has a deal to build wind turbines on a piece of land there. Well, out come some skeletons, and alterior motives to why some people want the town to approve the deal for the wind turbines, unknow to the husband. Added to all this, is the story of a little girl who went missing over two hundred years ago. Odd things start to happen, and the wife starts doing some research on the history of the property they're living at, and on the missing little girl, which leads to a pretty dramatic ending.
Not a bad story, though it needed a little more development and stronger drama, good acting, cheap looking ghosts and not a lot of money spent on VFX, some nice set design, and interesting shots from the director.
I may not buy this for my collection, but I might watch it again.",1331942400,,1021,4.407407407407407
2615393,4,B000GNOSF4,"Based on a true story, ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" stars the talented Julie Delpy as Jeanne Cooley who moves with her husband Guy [Justin Theroux], and daughters Molly [Kathleen Regan] and Lucy [Cassidy Hinkle] to rural New England, specifically the town of Princeton, MA where Guy is working on a windmill project under the supervision of local councilwoman Samantha Porter [Brooke Adams]. Before long, the Cooleys discover that quite a few of the townspeople are not in favor of the project and make their objections known, specifically Gretchen Caswell [Jamie Donnelly] who is the unofficial keeper of the town's heritage, and hostile/creepy next-door neighbor Jonas Dodd.

Jeanne who is also grieving the tragic death of her youngest daughter, keeps hearing a woman's voice from the woods, a voice that seems to be calling out for something she has lost, and as Jeanne digs into the history of the old farmhouse they occupy, she discovers the mysterious disappearance of 6-year-old Lucy Keyes back in the 1700s, and how the tragedy caused her mother to go almost insane. The rest of the movie revolves around Jeanne trying to solve the mystery of the disembodied voice and figuring out her own daughter's [Lucy] role in the mystery.

The movie is actually quite engaging and well-made, despite being more of a made-for-TV type of show. The production qualities are impressive, with beautiful cinematography of the lush New England landscape. The acting is also quite credible, especially Julie Delpy's grieving/conflicted mother, who shares a strong affinity with her younger daughter, reminiscent of Lucy Keyes' own deep bond with her mother. Justin Theroux does not really impress in his role as the husband/father, remaining a secondary character for most of the movie. The other stand-out performance was by the little girl who plays Lucy Cooley. She is not only adorable but is also credible in her role without being annoying. The guy who plays the creepy neighbor also does a good job.

The special effects are nothing to shout about, and this is not a scary movie. It is more of a supernatural thriller with more suspense elements than real horror, which makes it a decent family drama. Recommended for fans of supernatural-themed dramas.",1312329600,,2249,5.0894308943089435
2615394,1,B000GNOSF4,"From the trite story to the phoned-in acting, The Legend of Lucy Keyes is simply bad.  You've seen it all before, and it's been better.  Predictable and truly a waste of your time.  Some of the worst acting comes from the biggest name here, Brooke Adams.  What was she thinking?  Oh, wait, clearly she wasn't.  Hope she was paid well.  City couple who've lost a child in an accident move to the country with their surviving children when the husband gets an offer for a potential job (not the actual job, mind you, but a potential job) contingent on the town voting on a windmill project.  From the get-go, it's obvious who the real villain is here and who the true looney is.  Indeed, the best acting in the entire film comes from Mark Boone, Jr., as the resident loon.  Alas, Boone cannot carry the film.  The two leads are uninspired and uninspiring.  The male lead in particular is hard to like (he actually urinates at his property boundary to mark it).  One might feel something for the female lead, but her character is never developed.  No character is.  Everything here from plot to direction to acting was punched from a die-cut piece of cardboard.",1304985600,2,1158,4.580487804878048

The events that are suppose to be paranormal/creepy include such things as doors opening and winds picking up.  I didn't care for the flashbacks in time that are suppose to join the two characters together.  The effects were lack luster.  I guess the only positive thing I can say is at least there was a ghost in it as opposed to the ghost being a figment of the imagination.,1301702400,,483,4.206521739130435

2615398,5,B000GNOSF4,This movie was really really good. Great for a teen age Halloween party. I am from Worcester mass and it was filmed nearby in Princeton. I am looking forward to seeing more from this young writer director John Stimpson.,1225843200,2,219,4.641025641025641
2615399,4,B000GNOSF4,"Although this movie is listed as a suspense or thriller movie, it really is more of a mystery movie.  I don't know who gave this movie an 'R' rating because, as most, it is more like a 'PG' movies.  My ten-year-old granddaughter watched it with me, and she liked it so much she begged to keep it to show to her girlfriends coming over for a Halloween sleep-over.

As we were watching it, I thought that if this is based on a true story, it is genuinely amazing.  It turns out, however, that there was a real Lucy Keyes who disappeared some 250 years ago without a trace, but this story is one person's idea of what could have happened to her.  I have to say that it is an imaginative story about Lucy that arrives at a relatively exciting conclusion (especially for little girls!).  We could have done without the 'evil land developer' angle, which is so common in movies that it could hardly be considered imaginative or new.

There are a couple of scenes that might be uncomfortable for traditional values families, so you might watch for them and fast forward or talk about it with your kids.  Other than that, this is a movie the whole family could watch and to try to figure out before the end what really happened to little Lucy.  I think most school-age kids could handle the movie if watched with their parents.",1225152000,6,1319,4.439834024896266
2615400,3,B000GNOSF4,"The story is good - as most local legend stories go. There is a subplot which makes it interesting.  You can tell the actors who are not familiar with the area - the ones who call WestMINster Road ""Westmin-is-ter"" Road.  I would have thought someone in proofing or the writers might have noticed this.  We New Englanders are used to unusual sounding names for our roads, mountains, and towns.",1194220800,4,392,4.6521739130434785
2615401,2,B000GNOSF4,The movie is well made but how many times can they make a movie about city folks moving into a farm and stir up local ghosts?  I'd give the movie a higher mark if not for dozens of movies I have already seen with the same old premise.

The movie is good, the ending a little dragged out.  It lost me at the end, because it was so fictional.  However, the parts where the true story was unfolded was interesting and well done.  I live in Princeton myself and the person before who stated that this should be pulled of the shelf needs to calm down.  I've only lived here a short time and I've noticed two sides to Princeton. One side- ""high-class"" (as they stated), snobby, rich. Other Side- Friendly, earthy, farm owners, very in tough with nature.  I guess it just depends on what part of Princeton you're living in.  As for the movie, well done.  Making a movie must be tough & it's no one's right to make such rude comments about someone's passion and their projects.

2615403,2,B000GNOSF4,"They say the film is based on the real events about a missing 4-year-old girl Lucy, who lived in rural New England about 250 years ago. In ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" writer and director John Stimpson creates a fictional story about the Cooley family (Julie Delpy, Justin Thetoux, Cassidy Hincke and Kathleen Regan), who just arrived in the rural town for their father's work of the windmill project, and the director connects the contemporary fiction about the urban family to the facts about Lucy Keyes and the mystery surrounding her.

The concept looks brilliant on paper, but as the film goes on, we notice it doesn't work as it looked at first. The biggest problem is the story of the Cooleys, which is saddled with many familiar items seen in the films about haunted house or horror films in general. An old lady warns against the new project, and says the place where the windmills are to be built is haunted. A strange neighbor does something weird and annoying - heap of clam bellies - and again warns the Cooleys that they don't know anything about the woods. When Delpy's mother wants to research the local history, she is seen turning pages in the library. Why doesn't she just leave the town with her daughters is more mysterious than the entire plot of the film.

Things get worse, however, as what you know will happen will not happen very fast. The story is repetitious, the stock characters as I mentioned above appear one too many times and the film's overall pace is too slow. Once we know the drift of the story, it does not surprise us any more. The truths about the missing Lucy are revealed as another Lucy's story unfolds, but frankly I didn't find the latter interesting very much, and the neat conclusion requires enormous leap of faith even by the standard of occult thriller.

To me the greatest attraction of ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" was the film's star Julie Delpy, whose previous works include such as fantastic ""Before Sunrise"" and equally wonderful ""Before Sunset,"" and embarrassingly bad ""An American Werewolf in Paris."" I just don't understand why Paris-born Julie Delpy should be cast as mother of two daughters living in New England while Jeanne's role doesn't need to be French. Also, I admire her beauty and am ready to admit acting talent, but I don't think screaming or being terrified is not her forte. And Justin Theroux is not required to do much.

""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" is mildly entertaining with its authentic locations. But perhaps the real legend of New England would be more interesting than the film itself.",1175817600,6,2565,4.731543624161074

She watched it with her dad and kept telling me about it.  It's suspenseful or ""spooky"" to use her words, which she loved.  We watched it again and I saw it and it is nice to find a film that we could watch together.  I covered her eyes in the particularly scary parts, but other than that, it is a family film.  My husband and I went to college in rural New Hampshire, so it was lovely seeing New England again.  It was shot in Hi-def digital and I was impressed with the quality of the shots.  Delpy is wonderful and as a mother of young children, I could identify with her in the film.  My daughter loved the two Lucys and the intense love of the mothers for their daughters (an important theme to a very little girl).  I liked how realistic the interaction between the children and the family seemed to me.  So many times children in films come across as treacly ala ""Hallmark"".  Not so in this film.  I found the change in the Brooke Adams character a little, well, unbelievable.  The one part that rang untrue.  I mean when she was operating the heavy machinery and dumping the body, I don't know it became a different movie (although, Adams was great up to that point).  Also, in the 18th century scenes when both the mom and the older sister both have plucked eyebrows probably should have been corrected in post.

2615413,4,B000GNOSF4,"I liked this movie. I think the fact that I live in Hubbardston (which is the next town over from Princeton) has a lot to do with it. It's a local legend/ghost story for me, and aside from the fact that the Cooley's youngest daughter actually died from crib death (not being hit by a car), I think John Stimpson did a pretty good job of staying true to the facts as they are purported to have happened.

It was really neat seeing the church and library on tv (which we recognized because we drive by them so often), especially since the Princeton town library is both one of the most beautiful and spooky looking buildings in the area.

My husband and I drove all around Princeton on Colombus Day (2 days ago) and although we found the road where the Keyes family home is supposedly located, it wasn't there. We think they purposely mislead us in the movie to protect the privacy of the family that lives there now. We certainly wouldn't have trespassed onto their property and disturbed them, but still - even seeing people standing on the edge of your property, taking pictures of your home, would most likely be disconcerting for them. So although I'm disappointed, I understand.

I plan to try to find the cemetery where they are buried. There are SO many small, old cemetries scattered all over the place out here that it will probably take awhile to find the right one.

This movie really amped up my desire to delve more deeply into the history of the area out here. Very well done, well acted, and the fact that Lucy Cooley is the spitting image of my cousin's daughter doesn't hurt either. :)

It's not at all a ""scary"" movie by my estimation, but it is definitely creepy (watch it with the lights off!) and like I said, the local flavor adds an extra dimension to it for me. I think it's definitely worth seeing at least once if you are a fan of creepy movies.",1160524800,,1870,4.424418604651163
8133519,2,B000GNOSF4,"It's really not bad - just boring unless you're in love with the lead actress.  If you're not, then it's just sort of kind of watchable, because of the great production values.  It's not scary, it's not original, the plot falls apart.  It could be three or even four stars if they edited it differently.  Half the plot is about getting the farmer next door to stop feeding his pigs clam bellies, because they stink up the main characters' farm.  Clam bellies, clam bellies, on and on for half an hour.",1523232000,,501,4.461538461538462
