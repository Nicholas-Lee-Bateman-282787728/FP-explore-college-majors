2458446,1,B000CCZRB8,"If you are already a fan of One Piece, skip this.  This is the extremely butchered American version.  You know, the version with the entire original musical soundtrack deleted, two full story arcs missing (and about 32 of 85 or so episodes simply deleted from the series altogether, so far...and they haven't even gotten to Arabasta and Skypiea yet), every episode deleted to about 4 minutes shorter than its original Japanese run, references to death, smoking, blood, guns, and drinking removed, ridiculous accents added to every character for no apparent reason, and an entire script written in bad puns.

Everything that makes One Piece one of the greatest adventure anime series of all time just simply isn't here.  The characters are shells of their true selves, the drama has been diluted by either being edited to a bare sanitized minimum at best or being drowned out by bad generic Casio keyboard ""background music.""  And, of course, you'll have to sit through that absurd ""rap"" opening.

To add salt to the wound, there is no uncut version or even a Japanese audio track included on this release, nor is there an uncut release of the series planned for the US at all at this time.  All in all, this version is an insult to the characters and story Oda Eiichiro created and an embarassment to those of us who actually care for this series.

And if, you actually do enjoy this version of the show, by all means go out there and find the original uncut version of the show.  You'll love it a hundred times more, I guarantee.",1136160000,5,1530,4.67910447761194
2458447,5,B000CCZRB8,"This animation is based on Oda Eiichiro's hit Japanese manga (comic book). I've read all the available volumnes of the manga (38 volumes), and it is one of the best mangas I've ever read (along with Berserk, Gantz, Claimor, etc.). As a big fan of the manga, I've purchased all the DVDs (Japanese release) and haven't missed a single episode on TV (American version).

A great manga does not always turn into a great anmination. In fact, I am yet to watch any animation that is better than the original manga -- probably that is an impossible task anyway (like any screen adoption of an original novel). However, I must say that One Piece is one of better animations based on a manga. The pace is not too slow (some animations based on manga are so slowly-paced that it is painful to watch), and character development is properly done. Do not expect Sprit-away quality animation (after all, this is low budget TV-series animation), but the animation is adequately-done, and faithful to the original book.

Now the comparision between the American verson and the Japanese version. An earlier reviewer (Anime Gobbler) heavily criticized the American version. I respect his/her opinion, and he/she is entitled to have his/her opinion, so my view does not imply any disrepect to his/her comments. Having said this, I disagree with his/her comments that the American version is much worse than the Japanese version. In fact, I cannot quite understand how one could give a high-rating to the Japanese version, but give only 1-rating to the American version. Although translaction is important, translation alone cannot make a 5-star work to 1-star work (assuming that the job was done by sane people). I agree that some translaction is somewhat corny (typical American kid pop-culture stuff), but it is not all that bad. In fact, I found the translaction to be better than most (compare this to Naruto who says ""believe it"" every 10 seconds; that IS annoying). The voice actors are fine (if not superb) in my opinion. Anime Gobbler criticized this by comparing ""Nami, you are my Nakama (Japanese)"" to ""Hey Nami, you are my friend."" He/she said this translation made it so much worse. If you translate Nakama into English, it means ""companion"" (of course, it is impossible to find an exact match between two words in two different languages, but companion is probably the best match). Companion is obviously not a word to be used in the situation, so friend is really the best choice if you have to translate the sentence in English. Further, One Piece is really about friendship, so it is consistent with the context. In sum, the translation does not destroy the entertainment value of the original Japanese animation.

There is quite a lot of violance in this animation, so this is not really for small kids (although my 5-year daughter enjoys this tremedously -- I show her only selected episodes). In my humble opinion, this is one of the best Japanese animation that has been aired in my recent memory (since Galaxy Train 999 and Battleship Yamato).",1135641600,,3046,4.887814313346229
2458448,1,B000CCZRB8,"One Piece... hmmm. Okay first, let met say that this series, in its original Japanese form, of course, is wonderful. This series, produced by 4kidz is HORRIBLE. It does not portray the main core of One Piece- friendship. How could they get it right? Could we, die-hard One Piece fans really expect that 4kidz would have gotten it right when Luffy shouts at Nami, ""NAMI!!! YOU ARE MY NAKAMA!!""? No, instead we had that ridiculous voice actor say ""Hey nami, your my friend!""

Or what about when Luffy is fighting Crocodile in Arabasta? Can 4kidz produce a perfect ""I DON'T WANT VIVI TO DIE! SHE IS MY NAKAMA!!""? No, i really don't expect them to. Nor would they even come close. In the original Japanese series, I cannot count the amount of times i have cried joyfully while watching the series. Yet, i have watched a lot of the same joyful episodes in the 4kidz' versions and i have felt absolutely NO emotion.

I am a hurt One Piece fan. PLEASE RELEASE THE UNEDITED! Not that i would buy them... you can just get them off of fansubs. But for little kids who pick up One Piece... please think of them. I don't want them to think that the main value of One Piece is the stereotypical pirate that America has created over the years.

Ugh. Nakamaaaa!! Sorry. There is no violence, no core values that are poured into One Piece, and especially no humor. If there were any Japanese or wait ANY humor, it was changed to some stereotypical pirate humor. And when you think about it, the humor that they put in doesn't really even make sense to me.

DON'T BE FOOLED. BAN 4KIDZ ONE PIECE. ONE PIECE IS NOT 4KIZ!!!",1135123200,2,1603,4.460750853242321
2458459,1,B000CCZRB8,"4kids is universally known throughout anime fandom for butchering all animes that they license.

As in my review of the 1st edited dvd of One Piece where I explained the incredibly lame 4kids edits, you will find the same inexplicable and stupid edits to the show as on the 1st DVD, such as edited out blood (from Zoro's fights) and edited out guns.

--------------------

Examples:

1) In the 4kids version, a gun that fires a piece of cork was pointed at Shanks' head.

In the original japanese version, it was a REAL gun with REAL bullets pointed at Shanks' head.  The person with the gun had EVERY intention of KILLING Shanks.

2) Zoro's major fight in this arc has all of the blood removed  from it, again, by 4kids.

In the original, he bleeds a lot after being stabbed IN THE BACK by the main bad guy of this arc.

------------------

Cuts like these should make you question if what 4kids is showing you on Cartoon Network is the real story.  Certain characters on this DVD are ALOT more ruthless in the original version, i.e. Buggy.  You won't see that in this version.  They are also quite willing to KILL if necessary in the original series.  Again, you won't see that on the edited DVD.

In other words, One Piece is not a show for 7 year olds.  This version is deliberately hiding the real story from you, and this should not be tolerated by anime fans.

And it's only going to get worse...

In future 4kids DVDs of One Piece, entire story arcs will be significantly SHORTENED or SKIPPED altogether.  In fact, as of right now, the One Piece dub is at episode 64, which is approximately episode NINETY-FIVE of the original series.  (As of Friday, April 21, 2006, Japan is currently at episode 262.)  This alone should tell you that something is seriously wrong.

I am only giving fair warning to ALL Cartoon Network and 4kids TV watchers of One Piece.  You are being seriously ripped off by 4kids Entertainment.

To make a long story short, this is not One Piece.  If you know anyone who has the original One Piece anime in their possession, go to that person and watch it immediately.  You won't be disappointed.

In other words, do not buy this severely edited DVD under any circumstances!

Otherwise, 4kids Entertainment will continue to assume that you are stupid and will continue to create such abominations that are excuses for dubs, such as this One Piece dub.

If you want to see the real story, pester 4kids to release uncut DVDs of One Piece.  When you see the original story, you will wonder why you ever even thought of considering purchasing this or other edited 4kids One Piece DVDs...",1145577600,10,2612,4.5766738660907125
2458460,1,B000CCZRB8,"I always find it funny that the 12 year old fans of the homeland versions (US or what have you) always enjoy the funtastic little things thrown in by 4Kids or other similar companies.  Probably because they are the suckers that are being targeted?

If you really have an open mind towards anime in general, this show is very action packed and also much more comedic in its original format.  Although not many people die in this show, there is a hefty amount of blood and violence to go around.  Proving that One Piece was made for (at the very least) early and mid teens.  Not 8-12 year olds.  Oh well, this is life.  America has been butchering good foreign shows for ages.  I used to like a lot of this kind of stuff too when I was younger...then I grew up.  Too bad for me I never grew out of the teenager phase (almost 25 now).

Who knows, maybe one day someone will make laws against this kind of sadness from even starting.  Or by (hopefully) castrating the ones who thought of it in the first place!!

2458461,4,B000CCZRB8,"I'll probably end up getting this anyway.  I've got most of the Japanese episodes from the Internet, but I still love the horrible editting of this version. I think it makes it so much funnier.  Plus, I can pop this version into my TV and go about household chores while listening to it.

I just really wish they'd make a feature to choose which version you watch.  Or make a special edition with 2 discs (one edited and One unedited).  I think tons of people would buy it, even you 4Kids haters out there.

In the end, this is a good buy if you enjoy the show and don't absolutly HATE the 4Kids version.  I know its not the Japanese One Piece that you all ""LOVE"", but its still a dang good show that you can't help but love.",1138060800,6,725,4.172661870503597
2458462,1,B000CCZRB8,"Bilgerats! Aargh!

I think what ""AnimeGobbler"" really refers to how not only certain words are lost in translation, but she means how the EMOTION is lost in translation.

Also there is a BIG differenece between the original ""Pirate King"" and the crappy 4Kids ""King of the Pirates"" phrase. The pirate king basically means that the person with that title is the best and/or strongest of pirate around, NOT an actualy king OF pirates.

And there are many people who say: ""Dont judge a book by its cover"". well, the 4kids version IS THE COVER. The original japanese version is the true book! (talking about the anime, not the actual book)

2458463,3,B000CCZRB8,"I have read everyone's review of One Piece and I have something to say.  I am eagerly anticipating the release of this series.  One of the things I am looking most forward to is seeing if Viz Video is going to keep 4Kids's edits (which I doubt) and/or voice actors.  Everyone's review has been of the version that has been shown on Cartoon Network..... even the stuff on Adult Swim gets edited a little (due to time).  And I have to agree with what someone said about the difference between manga & anime - they are two different mediums & it's a little unfair to compare the two.

Having said all of that, I have a request for all of the reviewers. If you do not know FOR SURE that Viz is keeping all of the 4Kids formating/editing, please retract your comments until after the release of this DVD.  If you DO know for sure that Viz IS keeping the 4Kids stuff, please let the rest of us know where you got your information.  I hope no one finds this ""review"" offensive, but I just really felt that there is a potential injustice being done here.",1137110400,2,1046,4.3061224489795915
2458464,1,B000CCZRB8,"American One Piece is a mess. If 4Kids was expecting this series to catch fire as the next Pokemon, they seriously shot themselves in the foot when they opted to leave out the original music, hire bland voice actors, and generally butcher and water down the scripts to death. Some edits are understandable for saturday morning standards (though One Piece arguably isn't a saturday morning show), others just feel like 4Kids pointlessly wasting money.

I will give credit where it's due though. Unless 4Kids went back and pulled a ""George Lucas,"" one of the edits on this disc is the infamous ""hammer gun"", a bizzare looking contraption that replaces a flintlock pistol a character holds to a child's head. The hammer gun is *very* badly edited in, but whoever came up with and executed the idea deserves points for thinking outside the box in a hopeless situation. It's in the running for best laughably bad edit of modern anime standards, and you owe yourself a rental if you haven't seen it.

I can't, in good conscience, recommend you watch the original Japanese version of One Piece, because there is currently no legal way to obtain it in North America. I will then highly recommend you read the Viz manga instead, which is fairly accurate to the original material. Rent this disc for the hammer gun, and hope and pray 4Kids never gets a chance to butcher anything this badly again.",1136851200,3,1387,4.775

If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to.

8097839,5,B000CCZRB8,"Your hate is unnecessary here. It is an undisputed fact that the original Japanese dub is unmatched. Everything else pales when compared. The horrors of the 4kids dub are also well documented. But let me remind you, that there were those of us not yet able to reach the anime treasures in all their greatness and this was the best we could have at our time. The times changed, and with them changed our opportunities. Eventually a more improved, if somewhat imperfect, replacement came along that brought with it the original greatness. Now we give our thanks that we were, at the very least, made aware of this great treasure. We also give thanks that the CP9 Saga is within reach, for everything that comes after is nothing less than a celebration of continued greatness. We are in a time where perfection is closer than it has ever been, even if it came from such humble beginnings.

8097840,5,B000CCZRB8,"What can I say about this version of One Piece. Well as much hate 4Kids gets, they just poorly reasearched this anime and I'm pretty sure they would have given up the license at the drop of a pin. But they were stuck with it from 2004 to 2007, so they made the best that they could. I got hooked onto the franchise starting with this dub and when the license was dropped and then picked up by FUNimation, I still watched it.

8097843,1,B000CCZRB8,"I am only writing a review of this because I am realizing how many people are aware that 4Kids has screwed with this series but are not apparently aware of where to find the unedited Japanese versions to compare them.

For starters, you can watch many fansubbed episodes of the original Japanese version over at youtube.com but just be aware that sometimes not all episodes are available and many have to be split into several parts in order to be uploaded. But they are free to watch and if you have the bandwith and the hard drive space they can be downloaded as free fansubs as well. The collected Japanese versions are available from ebay (the official releases from Japan not bootleg fansubs) if you can afford the stiff shipping costs from Japan and you don't mind reading subtitles (they have english subtitles and are region free).

Again, I don't own the DVD but I have been watching the dub episodes on Cartoon Network and yes they, in a word, suck.

Not only for the bad voice acting and direction and script and puns. But also for the arbitrary changes in character names!

Okay I can see the Zolo/Zoro deal but what's up with Portgas D. Ace becoming Portgas D. TRACE? Oh yeah those kids will never understand someone named Ace, we have to change that. And in the Japanese he's known as ""Fire Fist Ace"" but apparently the ban on the ""F"" word is still in effect on US tv  (thank you Beavis) so he's called ""Heat Fist"" instead.

What you are watchin on US tv is not One Piece at all but someone elses series. This is quite simply not the story which has been written by it's creator, Eiichiro Oda sama.

A loving creation of epic proportions chopped up and cut down to be turned into happy meal fodder.

p.s. Although I do like the opening rap song. But I wonder why they mention Sanji and Chopper long before they show up in the series.",1150070400,4,1847,4.443786982248521
8097844,4,B000CCZRB8,"Though I gave this DVD 4 Stars I'm a little disappointed with the lack of extras and lack of episodes on a disc.

For an Anime series that has more then 300 episodes, you'd think they'd put more then just 3 episodes a disc (look at Rurouni Kenshin, 40+ DVDs because it has so many episodes and there's only 3 episodes a disc). Not only but $19.99 for just 3 episodes and almost no extras is just a rip off. The extras include trailers for other Anime and production art. That's about it for DVDs 1 and 2.

I first viewed One Piece about a year ago when it first came out as the English Dub version and I have to agree with other angry fans about how it's been butchered. Now that I've found out about the 40+ episodes been removed or cut because the company who licensed it want it for `kids' even though in Japan it's not aimed at kids.

I'd love both the original version and the edited version for sale on the same disc (then it'd be worth what they expect you to pay) and it'd make so many fans of the ORIGINAL series happy.

I'd like to see what's so different between the edited and original version (I already know about the swearing and violence).

Don't get me wrong though, I love the edited version, it's really funny and Luffy is the coolest! This group of episodes (4-6) introduces us to Luffy's past with Shanks, Buggy the Clown and Nami joining the crew. And that's about it for such a small group of episodes.",1147564800,2,1425,4.262962962962963
