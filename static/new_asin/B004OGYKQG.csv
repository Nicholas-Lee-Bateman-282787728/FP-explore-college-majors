8437207,5,B004OGYKQG,"I received the DVD on August 9th and I have watched it 6 different times since then and it gets better every viewing. Bootsy and his rubber band are tight. His is at his silliness and playing his heart out on every song. Video is good for 1976. The crowd is hyped. Peanut and Mudbone (his singers) are great singers. I went to this concert when they came to my town in 1976 and this just brings back all kinds of emotions and feelings. This was when music was good and funky. I have purchased about 75 concert DVD's and this one is in the top 3 for sure. If you can find it, buy it and have a funky good time.",1325116800,,609,4.0
