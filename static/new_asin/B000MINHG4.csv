8169389,4,B000MINHG4,"This is a very hard to find series of Disney tales from the 1980's each tape has 2 tales on it all tales coming from different countries so the stories on each tape are shown with no sound an the a narrator voice the story over it.
I'm thinking this is due to it being filmed in different countries so they just used american voiceovers for the tales.
Honestly don't get this for your kid yes it does have meaningful lessons to learn but this will bore many of adults let alone kids they would just hate
most are not exciting an the voiceovers kind of ruin it.
This series of films ran volumes 1-19 and to find them all is extremely hard so I'd say these are mainly for the die hard Disney fans.",1484438400,,695,4.155555555555556
