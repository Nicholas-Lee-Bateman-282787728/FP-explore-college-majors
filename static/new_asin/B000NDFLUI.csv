2765987,5,B000NDFLUI,This will probably be Kirk Douglas last movie ever and it is an amazing story.  He plays a lonely dieing man who is brought into the son he never knew (based on his own greed and selfishness) by seeing glimpses of his sons life.  This movie keeps you wondering and once you sit down you will become totally engrossed in the story and will not be able to get away from the TV as you will need to know what happens next.,1182297600,,418,4.085365853658536
2765988,3,B000NDFLUI,"This is just a ""heads up"" kind of review for those who have heard
the incredibly overhyped praise for this very strange but no better than decent
movie. I read over and over that it is an incredibly ""spiritual"" movie with Kirk
Douglas giving the performance of a lifetime,  etc. In fact it's quite a
mediocre movie, and the spirituality is there, but I've seen mainstream
movies that are much more spiritual, and far better written.

  Yes, Douglas gives a great performance, in fact most of the acting and the
editing are quite good and professional. But don't be deceived, the movie is mostly
not about Douglas's dying character, it's about the rather misfit ""hero,"" who is
somehow presented (sometimes in a self-indulgent way) as a bad guy but good guy,
who is a ""victim"" of his father's abandonment and imaginary voices he hears where
his father (Douglas, of course) constantly condemns him.

  Elaborating on the poor writing, over and over it relies on what is way beyond
""suspension of belief"" to move the plot along. The hero loses and re-finds his love
through several plot lines that are beyond any ""synchronicity"" that
is reasonable to accept. And while some of the scenes are very well
done, others, especially the ones that have violence in them, are
worthy only of quickly fast forwarding through (while still playing
so you can see what is going on). The scene in the graveyard where
one of the minor characters is murdered is preposterous.

  There are some redeeming aspects of the movie, but I'd have to give it away, so
all I can say is, watch it if you feel inclined to, and you have my warnings about a
very questionable script.",1181520000,7,1649,4.694444444444445
2765989,5,B000NDFLUI,"This is an incredible movie. Totally engrossing, well-acted, meaningful, spiritual, with action, romance, and a father-son relationship (or lack thereof)....fabulous! Kirk Douglas plays a movie director near the end of his life. He is taken into an other-worldly cinema, where he watches scenes from the life of the son he never had any contact with, and deeply regrets his lack of involvement in his son's life. The story captured my emotions tremendously. It's both heart-wrenching and uplifting. See this movie!",1180224000,17,514,5.4375

What I am talking about is simply this, the movie made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me think all about the things that I did in life up until now. It made me think about those I left behind and or whom left me behind. It made me feel things that I did not want to feel, that I thought I had l gotten over.

2766074,5,B000NDFLUI,This movie was recommended to me by a friend.  I had never heard of it.  I have to admit at first I wasn't impressed but I stuck with it.  I'm glad I did because it was a really sweet story.  Warning: this was filmed after Kirk Douglas had his real life stroke.  Since he is sick and dying in the film it works.

This has an important message because there are a lot of people in Hollywood who seek out fame and fortune and ignore the important things in life such as your family, your morality, and your integrity. Often celebrities have short marriages and illegitimate children. Some let alcohol or drugs destroy their lives. They occasionally support charitable causes only to improve their public image.

2766078,5,B000NDFLUI,"This is a must see movie for any fan of spiritual films and any fan of great film making period.  Thank the Gods for Independent Films!

Michael Goorjian starring as Christopher Baines is the writer, actor and director of this deeply touching and inspiring film about aging filmmaker Donald Baines (Kirk Douglas)and his abandoned illegitimate son Christopher.

Baines never accepted responsibility for his son, the result of a one-night stand, and turned his back on him as a young boy.  Now, near death, he has regrets about this, but keeps them locked up.  Stan, his long-dead film editor, appears at his side one evening and convinces Douglas to join him for a movie.

He transports Douglas into an old-time movie theatre, the viewing hall for the Akashic Records (a universal and mystical filing system of all knowledge and people).  There he watches as three separate periods of Christopher's life unfolds on film.  It's a film within a film, within a film, within a film.  It sounds complicated, but it's not.  It's simply a well done film.

Beautifully crafted and very touching, the film was first released into distribution in March of 2006 and from there, made it into the Spiritual Circle Cinema's gallery of films.

Michael Goorjian is a talented actor, writer AND director who clearly puts his heart and spirit into his work. Michael has also directed Louise Hay's You Can Heal Your Life, and Wayne Dyer's Ambition to Meaning (now called The Shift)

Add this movie to your collection - it's a keeper.  Full of life itself, Goorjian coaxes the performances of a lifetime from everyone, including Douglas.

And keep an eye peeled for more from this incredibly gifted actor, writer AND director, because you WILL BE seeing more of him.",1242950400,,1745,4.907849829351536
2766079,5,B000NDFLUI,"ILLUSION

Have you ever sat around and wondered to yourself if your life was a movie, something that was being recorded from all angles and edited together once you go. For anyone who has ever thought about that this film is for you because it is all about that concept. I honestly bought this movie based on the fact that Ted Raimi is in it, and even though I was sure it was possibly only a cameo I still had to have it. Thankfully not only is he in the film for a good portion of it he is also a part of a huge moment, and to my surprise the film is also really good. The film while it does touch on many things is really all about the bond between a father and son regardless of whether or not they were together, and about love between two people who were destined to be no matter what got in the way and how long it took.

The story is about a famous movie director that has made a very good living and is nearing his curtain call, the thing is he has no one to leave his empire to because he abandoned his son and the child's mother many years ago. As his time grows closer second by second a friend of his shows up that just so happens to be a dead friend of his, this man it turns out runs the movie theater in heaven. He is in charge of putting people's lives on movie reels and editing them down into the most important parts of their life. It is here that the dying filmmaker is given the opportunity to watch three reels taken from his long lost son's life. These reels take us on three different journeys through the young man's life, each dealing with him and his true love and the difficulties that they face.

The first story is his son in his teenage years as a geeky kinda kid who is the outsider, the cool kids just ignore or pick on him ala every teen movie ever. The difference is this feels real and since it is life as a film it is kind of a play on that very concept. The young lad is in love a girl who guess what is one of the cool kids and even though he does every thing he can think of for her she turns him down, at first. The story unfolds and plays out in a very different way then you would think, I thought it was going to go a whole different route. The second reel follows the young man who is now in his thirties, lost and has no clue who he really is, in fact he is planning a trip to Egypt to find him self. It is her that a crazy actor wannabe is his boss and sends him on a trip to find some girl for him, he wants her at his extravagant play. It is here that a long lost love is found but it is also here that emotion, betrayal, sex, and murder create one of the most entertaining sections of the film. Then the final reel is shown as a man now in his thirties is no longer lost as far as him self but he is lost with out that one person who he feels for like no other. This is possibly the best of the three reels we are allowed to see, as he searches for the one that not really gets away all the time as she really gets taken away. This is the reel that also matters the most as it is the reel that helps a father see the error of his ways and is given one last chance to make things right. I know that sounds sappy but when you watch it plays out so well.

Director/co-writer/and star Michael Goorjian deserves all the props any one could ever get, he did an outstanding job. This guy after writing it with his friends shot the first reel with his money and used it to get money for the second reel, then he used that to finance the final reel. Of course when that was all done he used that to get Kirk Douglas and shoot the rest of the film. Now aside from that he also starred as Kirk's son in the film and does a marvelous job, he brings something new to the character with each reel while at the same time keeping him the same lost lonely guy. At the same time Kirk Douglas was outstanding as the father who longed to know his son but did not know how to, Douglas in what I believe was his last role brought a some what sad feel to the film that another actor may not have been able to.  Karen Tucker did a great job as Goorjian's lost love and makes the film stand out with a performance that borders on brilliance. Bryan Cranston appears as well in the final reel and does a great job as the one guy who ever reached out to Kirk's son, but it may be Ron Marasco who steals the show as far as the supporting cast goes. He plays Stan the guy who comes to show Kirk the reels and he gives a wonderful performance that to me could have warranted a best supporting actor nod. Of course I would not have this film at all if it were not for Ted Raimi who as expected does an excellent job in the second reel, thankfully he was in the film for a good amount of time. He plays a role in the film that ends up being very significant and throws Michael's character directly into reel three.

Michael A. Goorjian, Tressa DiFiglia, Chris Horvath, and Ron Marasco did a great job with the script as they have crafted one of the best independent films I have had the pleasure of seeing [full of emotion, redemtion, and even action]. Michael did a great job directing this feature as it moves smoothly and  never feels forced at all. This is a wonderful film that I really feel everybody would enjoy with out a doubt, it is Douglas's last performance that should warrant at least a rental. Go into this knowing you are about to be taken on a marvelous journey through the human spirit.",1232323200,9,5422,4.024118738404453
2766090,4,B000NDFLUI,"This small-budget movie was amazing! The storyline has a little something for everyone. The heart-breaking effort of a father trying to do one last thing to help his son, a son he denied all his life. Pay close attention to the dialogue! I particularly enjoyed the small part of ""Vladimir,"" played by Yevgen Veronin. Worth seeing!",1222905600,,330,4.910714285714286
2766091,4,B000NDFLUI,"People and the relationships we have with them are not always as they seem. A wise person once told me, ""There are two sides to every story. And then there's the truth.""

A dying man is given the opportunity to watch selected clips from his estranged son's life, and in doing so realizes that all the ideas in his son's head weren't at all accurate.  After all, how often in your life have parent and child misunderstood one another?

After watching this movie, you'll feel inspired to reconnect with people you care about, if for nothing else, just to clear away the illusions and love each other in truth.

2766092,5,B000NDFLUI,"This movie is an example of independent cinema at it's finest.

2766096,5,B000NDFLUI,"This movie was made on a shoe string budget by a novice director (who also acts the co-starring role). It is a haunting love story and a tale of dying with regret and opportunity for redemption. Kirk Douglas apparently was persuaded to act the role of the dying film director as a favor for the director, Michael A. Goorjian, who had struggled to raise the funds. However, the incredible acting of Kirk Douglas makes this a Holywood Hit (mispelling intended)! He is eloquent, humorous, and tragic, all-in-one. Oscar material. What an amazing performance, despite his physical challenges! I also loved the supporting cast...it was a roller coaster of tragedy, yearning, grief....and yes, a classical happy ending (unusual nowadays).",1190073600,3,731,5.203389830508475

It's really a love story about father who gets to know his son a little too late.. almost. Kirk Douglas is a dynamic actor even in his 80's and a joy to watch. Iam not sure why Bryan Cranston's name is listed under the title as he has a small part. I really enjoyed this movie and it gets better the more you see it.,1183593600,4,426,4.023529411764706

I'm sure you can read the other reviews, for me it was the depth and heart of this film, and the twist at the end to redeem it all, that gave it my 5 stars. But I was riveted through the entire movie, and loved the spiritual end-of-life overview aspect of it.
My respect for Kirk Douglas, playing a role right up to his late, late years like this, is not the highlight of the movie but lingers afterwards like fine wine. Michael Goorjian, wow, just loved him. Went to look up other films he has done and there aren't enough; even the ones they list, he's barely in the lineups but has had acclaim in a 1994 movie playing an austic child and parts in films like Chaplin, Disney's Newsies and for tv watchers, some tv shows. He directed this, stars in it, and has also written a novel, so he has my respect as well. Hope to see more of him in quality movies like this one.",1514851200,,896,4.215116279069767
