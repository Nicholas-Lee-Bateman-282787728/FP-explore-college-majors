A little movie you won't forget.",1139097600,,265,4.717391304347826

Great Independent film. shows importance of family, SACRIFICE, friendships and culture!!!!!! Besides the West Indian community any immigrant family adapting to the American way faces many of the issues mentioned in this movie. Teenagers trying to fit in, Parents trying to work hard to make a good living for their children,lots of peer pressure, a broken heart, deception, racial tension etc.  Nice story line",1133395200,,416,5.384615384615385
