1990643,4,B0001DHSCE,"I am a big fan of Leslie, so it is no surprise that I liked this DVD.  I was looking for something to help with my flexibility, balance and relaxation.  Since I knew absolutely nothing about Yoga, I purchased this workout first.

This workout gives you just enough instruction to get started, and that's exactly what I needed.  After about 2 weeks, I was more flexible, more balanced and I could stretch farther than I ever expected!

This workout is for extreme beginners.  After about 2-3 weeks you will definitely be ready to move onto ""real"" Yoga.",1143417600,17,551,4.628865979381444
1990644,4,B0001DHSCE,"This DVD starts with about 17 minutes of instruction on the yoga poses to be used (which can be skipped) and is followed by about 25 minutes of a very easy to follow, basic yoga workout.  This workout is easy and short enough to do at any time of the day and is great for beginners who want a very general intro to basic yoga poses.  If you don't have 25 minutes on a regular basis, you are also encouraged to take a few favorite poses and work on them on your own.  So you can be creative and do your own short workout if you so desire.

If you're naturally flexible and want to be challenged, however, you may out-grow this DVD quickly, although I think it's still worth looking into and keeping as reference.  Also, one thing that would improve the instruction is a little more explanation on what muscles the different poses target and work out, although she does provide some at the right moments.  Also, there is just the right balance of talking and illustration at a relaxed but consistent pace.  She's obviously a very seasoned instructor and is easy to learn from.",1126224000,42,1074,4.4213197969543145
1990645,5,B0001DHSCE,"I am on Weight Watchers and I am trying to add a variety of exercise into my life.  I have heard people talk about YOGA for years but never thought it was for me...until I bought this DVD.

Whether you are 120 lbs. or 280 lbs.-- you will be able to do this exercise routine.  Whether you are in the best shape of your life or just starting an exercise routine for the first time in your life.

Leslie covers the basics like no one else can.  She is easy to follow and easy to understand.  I fell in love with YOGA this first time I did this DVD.

I LOVE it!!!!!",1115596800,53,561,3.955357142857143
1990646,5,B0001DHSCE,"Hi everyone,

I am someone who does not like to exercise.  Through walking with Leslie Sansone I have begun to finally realize that, even though I don't want to exercise, once I walk a little, I feel infinetely better, healthier.  I have tried to do yoga before.  I bought a nice, easy video from someone and I could not do it.  I hurt my back, couldn't do any exercise for months, it was so depressing. About a year passed and I decided to give yoga another try, since I have back problems and thought yoga might help. I bought a yoga video and it was more of the same, I couldn't do the poses, the instructors were super skinny and wanted you to be a human rubberband and I am not.

 Recently, I saw that Leslie Sansone had a yoga video and I thought, never mind, I'm not going to waste my money again.  As I read some of the reviews I thought I would give it a try, but this would be the last time. Once I received this DVD, I was finally able to do yoga instantly!  I couldn't believe yoga could be so easy and feel so good. I actually look forward to doing yoga now and to exercising.  I've been doing yoga every day since I got the tape and I want to highly recommend this DVD to anyone out there who has never tried yoga and who may think they can't do it because they are not skinny or flexible.  I am not skinny. If I can do it, anyone can do it and the benefits are amazing!  You will feel great once you do this workout and you will feel empowered enough to order a more thorough one, like the one I just ordered - Yoga for Inflexible People.

If you love Leslie Sansone's Walk away the pounds videos, you will love Leslie Sansone's You Can Do Yoga video. Try it!  You will not regret it.",1107648000,268,1699,4.078313253012048
1990647,5,B0001DHSCE,"When I got this DVD, I sat down with every intention of just watching the whole thing through once before actually trying it, but by the time Leslie was done with the introduction, I felt that I could do all of the positions in the actual session.  Leslie shows you beginner moves so that you don't hurt yourself on your first try, and accelerated moves to work up to.  I am a larger woman and was able to do all of the moves and felt great afterwards!!",1106092800,34,453,4.195402298850575
1990648,5,B0001DHSCE,"I've never done yoga before and I was able to do this DVD just fine the very first time.  Some may find it too easy, others will find it just right.

It's very relaxing.  Great to do at the end of a long day.  The actual workout is approximately 30 minutes.  Leslie takes 15 minutes to introduce you to all the poses first (all together, it's appoximately 45 minutes long).  Once you learn those, you can just skip to the workout after that.

I like to do this DVD after doing one of Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds videos because it really stretches the muscles after the aerobic workout.  I recommend to anyone just starting out with yoga or anyone who would like to relax after a long day or an intense workout.

1990723,5,B0001DHSCE,"This DVD is fantastic. I've been walking with Leslie for a while now (her walking videos are all wonderful too) so this feels like doing yoga with a friend. The moves are easy enough for beginners like me, nothing intimidating at all. Might be good for more experienced folks too, I'm not sure. I was feeling sore in my lower back and shoulders this morning but after doing this session, I feel SO much better. I'm glad I made this purchase.",1424995200,3,441,4.45679012345679

1990757,3,B0001DHSCE,"This is a good tape.  I have been doing yoga for a while but I a getting older and therefore I need a yoga class that is easier on the body.  I thought this would be it and yes I do like the routine.  It is a good workout and stretches your muscles.  The only problem I have is with Leslie Sansone.  She is a terrible teacher, really awful.  She blabs on about things totally unrelated to what you are supposed to be doing at the moment.  And when you follow the routine and also do the breathing and looking at your arm etc. you have no idea when she is changing positions or etc, because she does not call it out.  She blabs on about things that have nothing to do with what one is doing.  I have several of her dvds and I actually like the workouts themselves, but listening to her is insane.  She randomly says things and at times totally out of context with what is going on.  I have many dvds of other people also - people that are very professional and make you feel professional when you take their classes.  Leslie Sansone needs to take lessons on how to be a professional instructor.  That is one thing she certainly is not.",1421712000,,1134,4.170506912442396
1990758,5,B0001DHSCE,"I have done advanced yoga, but having serious low back problems recently, I wanted just the basics to get back to moving around properly. Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds series are the only exercise videos I've gone back to repeatedly over the last 10 years, so I decided to give this a try. I skipped the first part that introduces the yoga moves, but I imagine that would be very useful to someone who has never tried yoga before. The workout itself is very basic, but pretty well designed and perfect for the level of intensity I was looking for. She uses yoga blocks for the triangle pose, but shows you how to do it without them, so they are not absolutely necessary. No other equipment (other than an optional chair to help with balance) is used in the workout (but you may want a mat if you're on a hard floor).

If you are familiar with some of her other workouts, there are usually a lot of other people exercising along with her, but she is the only person shown in this video. She's not as chatty and upbeat as she usually is, either, which I think is more appropriate for a yoga video. For her other videos I play my own music instead of listening to her talk, but I don't need to for this one. Also, I would have preferred to purchase this as an Instant Video so I could watch it from my Amazon account instead of having a physical dvd (some of her videos are available as Instant Videos).

I would recommend this for someone who is new to yoga or looking for a basic workout that is about 20 minutes long. If you are looking for something longer or more challenging, I'd look elsewhere.",1421193600,7,1598,4.323333333333333
1990759,5,B0001DHSCE,"I've done yoga off and on at various points in my life, but now, in my late 60's, I've had difficulty finding a program that feels right.

1990859,3,B0001DHSCE,I've been exercising with Leslie Sansone back when she sold her exercises on VHS.  I've done yoga in the past and I've tryed beginners tapes and DVDs.  My only concern about this one is that she doesn't instruct you to transition from one pose to another smoothly.  The transition from one position to another is a little abrupt.  It's great for beginners however the poses are slightly altered in comparision to how yoga is really done.  It's definitely a good stretch exercise.,1367366400,2,479,4.7926829268292686
1990860,5,B0001DHSCE,"As per her usual, Leslie delivers. The video has an option allowing you to view each of the moves before doing the entire yoga workout. I am over 30 and need to lose 100 pounds, this yoga workout was something I could do. It's definitely challenging, physically, but Leslie makes it easy to follow. And there's no ""hocus-pocus-mumbo-jumbo"" as far as if you're a Christian and questioning whether your faith would allow you to purchase this workout (as I read in a previous review/comment pertaining to this workout).

1990862,5,B0001DHSCE,"I love this DVD!!  I have tried other ""beginner"" yoga DVD's and found them difficult and confusing.  Leslie explains the positions very well and gives you time to get into position before moving on.  This is a great place to start if you want to try Yoga!

1990875,1,B0001DHSCE,"If you are a a true Christian, then like me, you will stay away from this form of 'exercise'. I do not encourage anyone to get involved in any type of yoga no matter what is purported as innocent exercise.
I firmly believe that many Christians should look at the roots of this 'exercise' and strongly suggest you research its foundations, open your eyes to the truth; [...]

I have many of Ms Sansone's walk away the pounds and regularly do do physical exercise with them, However, my spiritual 'exercise' does not come from doing such things as this. Anyone who is a true Christian will know what I am stating in love, be wise and understand what yoga is really about.

HOWEVER BUYER BEWARE I have no clue what makes people think they can sell this DVD for $60. I paid $14.95 when it was a new release, now you can buy it on walmart.com for $11 NEW.",1325203200,10,398,3.975
1990877,5,B0001DHSCE,This was given as a Christmas gift and the person I gave it to has not tried it yet.  The package was very sturdy and it arrived on time.  I trust that Leslie Sansone has conquered Yoga like she has conquered other types of workouts.,1293580800,2,233,4.155555555555556

Anyways, when her mother received it, the dvd was broken; cracked right down the middle. There was no apparent damage to the shipping container either, which led us to believe that the dvd may have been destroyed prior to shipping.
It would not have mattered so much if this dvd weren't a present for my mother-in-law's birthday, but it was, therefor we were quite upset and disappointed.
As far as a review of the dvd, we can't give one at this time as we don't have a working one.
I would expect at this point for the seller to replace the dvd and ship us a new one for free to make amends for this situation.",1275696000,,882,4.351515151515152

Leslie's routine is very, very basic which made me feel like I could actually do it and it feels great! The actual workout portion is only 15 or 20 minutes which means its quick enough to use this as a stretch after your usual workout. For anyone who already has a decent grasp on yoga you may want to pick up a more advanced and/or longer workout.",1238976000,6,519,4.252525252525253
1990883,2,B0001DHSCE,"Leslie should really stick to her walking DVDs.
As an avid lover of yoga and one who has done it for many years, this really is far too basic.
Even if you consider yourself a beginner, this DVD would only be cost-effective at the very beginning stages. Once you've passed that level, this DVD is no longer a challenge. It's sooo easy and basic that it's ridiculous. And I'm all for starting slow and steady. But this beyond starting slow and steady. I'd call this a Mickey Mouse yoga DVD. Even my 9-year-old would roll her eyes and laugh at this one, and she's just begun a weekly yoga class.
Many of the poses that she shows are not even shown very correctly. The way she does the Cobra, for example, is wrong. The Downward Dog is not even shown in the best way.
This DVD is so slow and boring. Quite a waste of $. There are far better yoga DVDs out there that cater to all levels taught by people that are truly in the know.
With all due respect (and I love her walking DVDs - I have most of them), I don't think Leslie knows much about yoga. You can really tell that this is NOT her area.",1237420800,8,1091,4.150943396226415

My flexibility has already begun improving after only two weeks, and I don't feel nearly as tight just after a walk.  I'm also much more relaxed since I incorporated the yoga DVD in my exercise routine.  Give the You Can Do Yoga DVD a try.",1221177600,8,400,4.1688311688311686
1990885,3,B0001DHSCE,"I am a big Leslie fan and feel that she can always make the exercises simple enough for everyone to participate.  The DVD is divided into an introduction, showing the poses, some of them for an advanced beginner.  There is no explanation of props as aids until later, introduced in the second half, true work out.  The first half could have been left out for me.  The second half is the actual session.  Again, Leslie encourages work at your pace etc, but talks so much she does not cue you when to stop the pose, especially if you are twisted around and can't see the screen.  The variety of poses are good though and I would do the second half to augment my own practice.  Overall, a B- experience.",1212192000,10,700,4.37984496124031
1990886,3,B0001DHSCE,"I'm a big fan of Leslie's WATP workouts so I had high hopes for this one too. Unfortunately, I didn't think this is one of her best. The music is strangely upbeat for a yoga workout and she misses a number of cues (and when you're twisted around, not looking at your tv that's a problem).

I am an inflexible person and new to yoga. There are VERY few modifications shown. She'll say something like, ""If you can't reach, use a chair"" but she never shows how to use the chair.

I'm sure that this is a decent starter workout, but I expected better from Ms. Sansone.",1204502400,7,564,4.261682242990654

This is the only video that didn't have me twisting into a pretzel and in pain the next day.  Leslie includes a section where she explains all the poses (name and how to do it) and then another one for the entire routine (explaining modifications along the way).  She is also easy and enjoyable to follow (no group of people with her) and I feel wonderful after doing the routine.,1200268800,16,520,4.275510204081633
1990889,5,B0001DHSCE,She is thorough and has a great way of making you feel like she really cares.  Leslie gives you the feeling she knows you haven't been working out for a while;)  Her walk video's are all great and the yoga is good for relaxing and stretching muscles.  I bought it because I read it burns calories as well.,1197936000,3,305,4.224137931034483
1990890,5,B0001DHSCE,"I wasn't sure if I would like doing yoga with Leslie as I have done her walking videos, which I love, but she tends to be high energy and talk a lot, which is ok for walking videos but I just couldn't think of ""yoga"" and ""Leslie"" in the same sentence.

I'm new to yoga and really loved this DVD. It was just right for me starting out, Leslie talks but more appropriately for this kind of instruction (no whoops or hollers); and because I've never done yoga, I appreciated her instructions along the way. I felt so stretched and rejuvenated afterwards. She takes it slow and explains all the poses.

I was disappointed when it ended because I wished it had been a bit longer. This DVD has definitely gotten me into yoga; I'm looking forward to doing it again.",1182816000,13,758,4.368794326241135
1990891,3,B0001DHSCE,"I liked this Yoga tape because she introduced the moves thoroughly and it's good for beginners.  My only complaint is she talks WAY too much for a Yoga tape.  Yoga is meant to be peaceful and relaxing and with her talking so much it's hard to do that.  I usually love her chattiness when doing the walk away the pounds work outs, it's motivating and gets me through them easier.  But with Yoga, you just want peacefulness to connect to your body and relax.",1170115200,9,456,4.392857142857143

It was just what I needed to start getting into a good yoga routine without having to go to the health club which only has yoga at night.  She has a learning session first to show you the moves then puts it into a routine.

When I discovered Leslie had released this DVD along with a companion DVD ""You Can Do Pilates"" I figured I should give this a shot.  Boy, am I glad I did!!!

Leslie takes her calm, focused yet fun workout style in this DVD, which makes it easy for anyone to do the program.  Yipee!!  Thanks so much!",1168473600,9,475,4.292134831460674
1990894,3,B0001DHSCE,"I have 6-7 of Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, which I love and have been doing for 2 years now.  After a back injury (unrelated to the exercise programs), I wanted to start yoga to increase overall flexibility and strength in my back.  I thought this dvd would be a great start, however, Leslie fails to provide enough instruction for each pose and I think a true yoga master would take issue with her technique for many of the poses.  A final criticism is that the actual workout is very short--too short given the price of the dvd.  Really, only the most basic poses are covered here, the ones that people are likely to have already heard of. Down Dog, Triagle, Cobra.  All are wonderful poses but just scratch the surface of what yoga offers

I would recommend the Yoga Zone Beginners dvds, lots of instruction in to proper form and modifications for the true beginner.  Six weeks of doing yoga 3-4x a week has already made visible changes in my body and I am amazingly more flexible.",1147305600,21,990,4.559322033898305

As an avid fan of the Leslie Sansone Walk at Home DVDs, I decided to give 'You Can Do Yoga!' a try, and after the first session, I was addicted. Like everything Leslie produces, this DVD offers easy-to-understand instruction, along with genuine encouragement and the perfect musical accompaniment. On the first track, she guides you through each of the moves as a foundation for the second track, during which she incorporates them into a nicely flowing routine. Miss the walkers? Leslie also includes a fun walking session that integrates Yoga moves and features two of her popular walkers. I love the fact that she focuses on the poses and suggests breathing normally, which makes it simple. As Leslie states, the Yoga breathing techniques come with time - the important thing is not to hold your breath, but to keep it flowing as you move.
