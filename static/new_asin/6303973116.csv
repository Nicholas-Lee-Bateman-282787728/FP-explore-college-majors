742444,5,6303973116,"This is satire and sillyness at its best!  From the front porch paper boy scene to the acquisition of the coveted ""battery of the gods"" EWJ  will make you laugh out loud. The observations on modern life are funny for  both kids and adults. I guarantee you will love this video!",965260800,4,277,4.392156862745098
742445,4,6303973116,"Of the 4 tapes available this one has two of the funniest episodes and the best sense of what the charm of the series was really all about: From the random quotes from ""The Litany Against Fear"" to the whacked use  of Fondu Forks this is Animation for those of us who thought Max Headroom  was just our speed back in the eighties.  -Manic, Random and Post-Modern,  Highly recomended",956707200,7,381,4.478260869565218
7857358,5,6303973116,"Great fun and whacky humor in grand unpredictable style of the old ""Bugs Bunny"" cartoons. Contemporary cartoons got the flash and noise but just can't match humor.",1432252800,,163,5.074074074074074
7857359,5,6303973116,Earthworm Jim was one of those animated series that had enough sly social commentary written in to the show to keep an intelligent adult laughing while still appealing to children. It was too good to last (at least on network TV).,1371513600,,230,4.634146341463414
7857360,5,6303973116,"When I saw this show on TV I knew it was too good to last. You have to have a certain sense of humor to appreciate it, but for those of us who do it's fun to watch. There are no DVDs or complete season sets available that I know of and I'm glad I was able to get the four VHS tapes that were released. It is a funny and now somewhat obscure show!",1325635200,,346,3.6266666666666665
7857361,5,6303973116,"BRILIANT, I love it more than my grandmother, EarthWorm Jim is one of the most funny thing I have seen, and trust me, I have see na lot, every one shoud own this, I hope it will be on dvd soon.",1134518400,3,193,3.731707317073171
7857362,5,6303973116,"The Book of Doom- Due to a printing error, the secret to world domination is revealed inside one of Jim's pop-up story books.

My thoughts: This episode is hilarious! The best episode out of the four tapes.

The Egg Beater- As the world's most conscientious superhero, Earthworm Jim spans the Universe, braves untold perils and does battle with each and every one of his ruthless arch-enemiesas he scrambles to recover the egg beater he borrowed from his neighbor.

My thoughts: Another great episode that is high lighted by one of the funniest quotes of the series ""Don't play dumb with me, you...dumb guy."" Another VHS that is a must buy!",1121385600,4,640,4.8
7857363,4,6303973116,"I remember watching this series on the WB in the early 90's. Luckily, I was recently able to find two of the four Earthworm Jim VHS tapes at a local store and this show is as great as it was originally.

Conqueror Worm- When a freak copy machine mishap creates a diabolical duplicate of Earthworm Jim, our hero is mistakenly imprisoned while his evil twin takes over the world.

My thoughts: This is a really great episode, the funniest part is when Jim's cellmate uses Jim as dental floss. It is hilarious. Another thing that makes this episode so great is that we get to see an evil Jim who takes over Jim's indentity, which is why the real Jim ends up in jail. Great stuff.

Day of the Fish- While scouring the Galaxy for a cup of sugar, Earthworm Jim falls into the fiendish fins of Bob the Goldfish. Seizing Jim's supersuit, Bob rockets off to destroy the Universe.

My Thoughts: Only Jim could end up in a battle for the universe when he is just out looking for a cup of sugar. This episode is okay, but not as good as ""Conqueror Worm"". Overall, this is worth getting for Earthworm Jim fans since I doubt we will ever see this released on DVD, but you never know",1121385600,4,1168,4.319634703196347
7857364,5,6303973116,I love Earthworm Jim! And he needs to have his TV series released on DVD! This was one of the best animated shows of the 90s! Please release it on DVD!,1094256000,6,151,3.903225806451613

This video is awsome very funny espeacially on the sword of rithiousness episode when the sword says fear me ....... old tree. and the tree gets up from its soil and runs away terrified.[I was laughing so much when I seen that part].

7857366,5,6303973116,"This fine VHS was pure geniosity and I don't know how anyone could ever part with such a classic as this.
