6477996,1,B00L9OPRB8,"I didn't care for this comedian though comedy like any other form of art, is highly subjective.  I like Tom Segura, Jim Gaffigan, Tracy Morgan for reference.  I have never cared for the Southern comics like Bill Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy, etc. so this comic's common reference to how they do things in Texas just didn't resonate with me.  He obviously has a significant following but I didn't find him funny.  I didn't even make it through 15 minutes of the video.",1427500800,,462,4.666666666666667
6477997,5,B00L9OPRB8,"This guy was Hilarious, I could completely relate to him, which man doesn't have a ""Captain Evil"" for a wife.

I thought I was the only one that had to beg to visit a buds house once during my 70 hour weeks to provide everything.

All in all very funny guy, I call it ""Truth Comedy"" since everything he says is True and ""Relatable"" (hint the title).",1427500800,,349,4.1940298507462686

6477999,1,B00L9OPRB8,"I didn't see what year this was filmed but if the first 5 minutes of your show is about killing a possum for no good reason and the story isn't even funny,  clearly there is a reason you filmed in Texas. I didn't even smirk once and stopped watching after twenty minutes.",1427068800,,271,4.211538461538462

6478004,5,B00L9OPRB8,"Good show, funny guy with a good perspective on marriage & family, power-shopping wives, his gay gym, being a South Texas boy that's a fish out of water living in LA.  Would definitely like to see more of him, would be fun as hell to see in person.  Great music at start & end: ""Rancho Grande"", got the whole family up on stage.  This is the kind of guy you'd want to invite you to a family backyard BBQ.  Some swearing (even a lot wouldn't bother ME) but more as punctuation than anything offensive.",1425859200,,500,4.287234042553192
