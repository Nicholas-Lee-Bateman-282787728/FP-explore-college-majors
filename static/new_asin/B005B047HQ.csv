8463775,5,B005B047HQ,"In New York City, a struggling actress named Jennie Carr (Anna Lee) stumbles into the middle of a murder mystery, when a nice lawyer buys her dinner and invites her back to his place. Within minutes of their arrival, a group of gangsters barges in, tosses Jennie out, and the lawyer is shot dead. Now, the boss of the gang wants her killed as well. Simultaneously, the world is also searching for her, since an innocent man has been accused of the murder, and only she can clear him. Having fled to London, Jennie goes to Scotland Yard for help, seemingly to no avail. Luckily, she manages to stow away on the trans-Atlantic flight of a new mega-plane! It's sort of a luxury liner on wings. Of course, the gangster boss, as well as the Scotland Yard inspector also happen to be aboard. NON-STOP NEW YORK is a tremendous 1937 film that deserves re-discovery. It's packed full of mystery, intrigue, thrills, and humor. Highly recommended...",1414886400,,938,4.6909090909090905
8463776,5,B005B047HQ,"Non-Stop New York is a non-stop delight for classic film lovers, and especially those who like ""B"" productions. This one is so stylish, so fun and entertaining, that if Hitchcock's name were attached to it, it would surely be ranked with the best from his British period.

 Robert Stevenson directed this little British gem from 1937 with quick pacing and much humor, not to mention a dash of style and romance. Anna Lee is simply wonderful as a charming girl finding it tough going who is befriended by an honest attorney who has found himself among criminals and wishes to make a clean break. John Loder winningly plays the policeman who doesn't at first believe her when she turns to him in order to save the man accused of his murder. She knows the convicted man is innocent because she was there at the lawyer's apartment having a meal and saw his killers.

 Francis L Sullivan, Frank Cellier, Desmond Tester, Athene Seyler, William Dewhurst and Drusilla Wills all offer fine support in this adaptation of a book by Ken Attiwill called Sky Steward. The second half of the film takes place on a transatlantic flight aboard the dandiest and most luxurious sea plane you're ever likely to see onscreen, much less in a British ""B"" film. A humorous crook trying to blackmail the killer, a mischievous pre-teen violin prodigy who only wants to play the sax and a parachute all play a part in a truly exciting ending at least equaling if not topping any of Hitchcock's during this period of British cinema.

 So Hitchcock-ian and so entertaining is this delightful little find that it deserves a wide release. At the very least, it deserves its own release by a major distributor of ""B"" films. A mystery both fun and romantic, this little gemstone is a must-have film for anyone who loves ""B"" mysteries.",1372204800,,1801,4.719745222929936
8463777,4,B005B047HQ,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD (there's not even a company name listed under Product Details!). My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes, other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

The British programmer NON-STOP NEW YORK is a well-done amalgam of the crime, romance, and sci-fi genres that in part concerns a double-decker airplane with an outdoor balcony (hold onto your hats, ladies & gents)! Based on Ken Attiwill's novel ""Sky Steward,"" this film is also known as ""Blood Oath.""

The six-engined ""Airmail"" is capable of taking off from and landing in water. It has staterooms, a bar, communal dining areas and other ocean liner amenities. This flying boat enters our story when chorus girl Jennie Carr (Lee) and Scotland Yard Inspector Grant (Loder) use it for a non-stop flight from London to New York. Miss Carr was witness to a murder in NYC and she fled to Britain, but now races against time to prevent an innocent man from being eloctrocuted. Jenny's in grave danger however, for the killers are also on the Airmail!

This overgrown, rocket-propelled Greyhound has a piano bar, jacuzzi and bowling alley, plus a passenger list that reads like a ""Who's Who"" of '70s comedy.
