5612971,5,B00BF0CGT2,"May 28th, 2013

I'd just like to start off this review by saying this: I enjoy comedy. I enjoy a wide range of comedy. I listen to Dave Chappelle, Gabriel Iglesias, Daniel Tosh, Bill Hicks, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall etc.... It's been (at the time of this review) nine years since Dave Chappelle has released a standup special and I have not laughed that hard since. Well, in the early hours of the morning; I'm wide awake, bored out of my mind. I'm on youtube and I see an advertisement for a new standup special from Ron White. I go to the link and download the entire special (100% legal, by the way) for only $5.00. So I push the link, and all of a sudden I'm that guy.......watching the special. I have now laughed as hard as I did all those years ago.

Now, if you're new to comedy or if you've only seen Ron White on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour then you're in for a surprise. Ron White is a very vulgar comic and isn't shy about dropping some F-Bombs (Look at the list of comics I like and you'll see I have no issues with this).

In this very unprofessional standup special, Ron White shows how he has one of the best deliveries in the business today. He talks about a wide range of topics like Sex, Tiger Woods, Dr. Phil, Autism, Cock Holsters, and of course booze. This is, in my opinion, the best standup special of his career. He's steadily been getting better from Tater Salad, You Can't Fix Stupid, Behavioral Problems and he stepped up his game even more with A Little Unprofessional. Ron shows us once again why his job is better than ours.

Cheers, folks.",1369699200,44,1574,4.343537414965986

Though incredibly funny for those with an open mind, this skit is very adult oriented so caution should be exercised when viewing by young folks.

5613097,1,B00BF0CGT2,"Ok normally I love listening to this guy. He is flipping sarcastic, truthful and funny. This new DVD - horrible. The sound is terrible, the jokes are old and boring and all he pretty much wanted to talk about was his pecker. Really? Come on Ron. You are so much better than this!!!! Don't waste your money.",1394928000,2,306,4.385964912280702

5613101,5,B00BF0CGT2,"What can I saw, I love Ron White.  He is funny as hell and apparently he knows some of the same people I know, haha, if his jokes are any indication.  It was so funny I watched it twice and laughed just as hard the second time.",1392249600,,227,3.8085106382978724
5613102,5,B00BF0CGT2,"He is just awesome.  His timing, topics, and his punch lines are just dead on.  This show is fresh material, will get you going in the first couple minutes and then it doesn't stop for the next 1+ hour.  It is explicit which is what most people love about him.  Definitely a must see.  Highly recommended.",1391040000,,305,4.375

Only one thing...seems there should be extras with Ron's wife (talented songstress Margo Rey) singing 3 songs and I can't get the DVD to play any of them. Anyone have a similar problem and a fix?  Or I could just buy one of her CDs from Amazon too!",1390435200,,364,4.388059701492537

5613105,5,B00BF0CGT2,"This man is a far cry from being blue collar nowadays. He's got money-money, the real kind that you have to say twice. Honestly though, he wears it well. I like his stories. I like how he stands up against stupid ideas and stupid people. He doesn't use a hacky catch phase. Ron White talks marriage, friends, family, substances, and he makes it all hilarious. This is on the list of comedy records that I return to again and again throughout my lifetime. It's a good hard laughing record.",1389657600,,488,4.49438202247191

5613110,2,B00BF0CGT2,I missed Ron's ability to spin a story and leave you in stitches. Not many stories just a long monologue about how much he likes and par takes in oral sex. There were a few good spots that made us chuckle.,1387929600,3,205,4.024390243902439
5613111,5,B00BF0CGT2,Ron is as unprofessional as normal. One of the funniest stand up comedians in the world with his own style of life as it really is whit. Sit back and get ready for new uses and meaning for the F word.,1387843200,,200,3.902439024390244
5613112,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron is hilarious! I rented this because my wife is not home, and she does not appreciate his sense of humor the same way I do. If you watch this show, the comment in and of itself is a little funny.",1387756800,,198,3.8536585365853657
5613113,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron White is always incredibly funny. He has such a natural sense of humor about him and gets right at my funny bone. I've heard him before and I absolutely loved this standup show... Had me rolling on the floor laughing the whole time! Good job Ron, you did it again!",1387584000,5,268,4.2745098039215685
5613114,1,B00BF0CGT2,"I enjoy Ron White and his humor, I have seen many of his stand-up routines. This routine had a few funny moments, but mostly it was just vulgar. I am okay with F bombs, I just don't find them funny enough to hold the show together.",1386806400,,231,4.043478260869565
5613115,5,B00BF0CGT2,"I had no idea how funny Ron White was.  I vaguely knew him to be the comedian who always had a drink -not water- in his hand, but until I watched ""A Little Unprofressional"", I'd thought him to be like most other passing-fads of comedy.  I've watched every stand-up he's made since watching this, and discovered him to be rather down-to-earth.  He's absolutely charming and handsome, and his style of comedy and humor is all his own.

I just LOVE his eyes, and that adorably male quirk of his lips when his own humor amuses him.",1386633600,,527,4.458333333333333
5613116,5,B00BF0CGT2,Ron White continuously is funny after all these years. He still amazes me. Never uses the same jokes. It is great.,1386374400,,114,4.476190476190476
5613117,5,B00BF0CGT2,Awesome....Funny and worth every penny. Ron White is one of the best and has only improved with age. Love him and will buy any more he has.,1384905600,,139,4.185185185185185
5613118,5,B00BF0CGT2,You can't go wrong with Ron White. He's funny with all of the stories that he tells and works better on his own.,1384905600,,112,3.9130434782608696
5613119,5,B00BF0CGT2,"I live in Austin, TX and he performed the show here and love the way he makes everyone feel good about there town, this album is one of the best he's performed especially since he has gotten away from the wholesome family oriented PG event Blue Collar Comedy Tour!",1384300800,,264,4.408163265306122

5613121,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Yeah, Ron's always been a little ""unprofessional.""  That's part of what makes him so much fun to watch.  This particular set is more self-aware than what I've seen before.  Ron understands that he's ""Ron White"" now...like his cohort Larry the Cable Guy, there's Ron White the person and Ron White the character on stage.  The difference is that ""Ron White"" the character isn't a parody of anything.  (""Larry the Cable Guy"" is, to a great extent.)  The facts are a bit elastic when they come within a certain range of Ron--but who cares?  He's spot-on as usual, and it's great fun.",1383523200,,580,4.683168316831683

5613123,4,B00BF0CGT2,"We love Ron White. Funny, irreverent and just downright naughty, in the best possible way. If we ever need a laugh, Ron's our guy. Love his sloshed style. Not quite as funny as They Call Me Tater, but still a great time.",1382659200,,220,4.261904761904762
5613124,3,B00BF0CGT2,"I love watching Ron White, as does my husband, but this did not have us cracking up the entire time like Ron normally does. It was still good, but a good portion of the material felt repetitive from other performances.",1381968000,,218,4.475

5613126,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron definitely displays some angst and embarrassment regarding his behavior this time around. . .everything from the unfortunate ""alcohol-related swimming pool incident"" (leading to the tooth loss that got this album named) to the truly regrettable Mamie Eisenhower joke.  His wife and dogs clearly still love him, and so does the audience.  He's still got it, but we think maybe he should go ahead and let the Mormon set his buzz level for awhile.  We'd like to see him stick around.",1381536000,,484,4.950617283950617
5613127,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron White has been my favorite of the Blue Collar Tour comedians and this DVD is no exception. He's a bit more vulgar than his cohorts and he's always got his scotch and cigar. Some of these jokes/stories are downright hilarious. My only complaint is that for a man who's 55, he talks a lot about his dick. Sure, he's married to a fine, famous looking piece of ass. But, she doesn't come out on stage and suck it, or is that going to be on the next DVD?",1381363200,,453,4.101123595505618

5613135,2,B00BF0CGT2,If they removed the jokes about oral sex the shows over. I sat there and watched a middle aged chunky man try to remember his jokes as he got more and more drunk.

5613138,3,B00BF0CGT2,"It was okay but I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as his other shows. If that was the only Ron White show I ever saw, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to see another. Fortunately, I know he's a good comedian and I guess just had an off-movie. I hope his next show is better.",1376179200,,288,3.816666666666667

5613149,5,B00BF0CGT2,"One must have a special sense of humor to appreciate Ron White. This latest performance is from Austin, TX. You will either laugh uncontrollably or will be disgusted. For me, he's hilarious, carrying the standard of George Carllin.",1374624000,,231,5.105263157894737

5613152,5,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron White A Little Unprofessional is in my words another smash comedy set by the Master.  True he uses alot of foul language during his comedy set but that's what makes him the way he is.  Some of my favorite parts of this DVD was the start with him with a shovel and then saying ""Told you to shut up"".  Perfect way to start the DVD then some of the jokes were sexual in style but given his past preformances thats a given for his sets.  But beside Christopher Titus, Ron White, and I think one other comedian who can make me laugh so hard I will fall over in the chair or sofa.  Ron White was able to do just that with most of this jokes my gut was hurting at one point and then almost cried from the laughing.  So in closing I own all of Mr. Ron White's comedy sets DVD wise Tatar Salad, Behavioral Problems, You Can't Fix Stupid, and now A Little Unprofessional.  So if you don't mind a comedian who is crude, little rude, and uses some foul language during his comedy set then pick up Ron White's latest set and prepare to laugh as hard as my family did during the show.",1373760000,3,1074,4.110047846889952

5613155,4,B00BF0CGT2,"Ron White, what more can be said. He's funny and crude, but with a suit, cigar, and bottle of choice; he holds nothing back. Four stars just a bit not as funny as his last one, and repeated some jokes. Still can't wait for his next one.",1373155200,,236,4.042553191489362

Most of his ""jokes"" are about his genitals and include comments about oral sex somewhere in the delivery.  His style has not changed at all and his jokes are delivered in a smug nonchalant way that gives you the impression that he really doesn't try very hard to please the audience.
