2605741,5,B000GEIREQ,"Highly recommended. For awhile I had been thinking this is one of Ken Burn's best. But it's by brother Ric. So one of Ric Burn's best. One of the best documentaries by anybody period. This is the definitive Andy Warhol documentary. I've seen others and they hardly compare. You needn't be a huge fan of pop-art (I'm not) to find this story fascinating. Intelligent explorations of what goes into the creation of creative people does make for such a rewarding experience. Family life, economic background, personal difficulties and experiences, cultural surroundings, those chance meetings and various contingencies, personal influences --these are all dealt with in sufficient detail during the four hours allotted to them. A comprehensive in-depth portrait of Andy Warhol is a portrait of (for better or worse...) us and American society of the last half century. This is what we learn. Warhol is perhaps more relevant than ever and that's also why this is an important documentary. Loads of incredible (sometimes rare) footage intelligently utilized, excellent narration, and music that had an effect of ushering me into a contemplative mood and drawing me further into the images come together to demonstrate that documentary films can be considered a work of art in their own rite. Well I'm gushing now, but I was impressed. However, the case is made that Warhol is the most important artist during the second half of the 20th Century. Now I simply don't buy that, but if not Warhol then who?",1248566400,7,1496,5.060728744939271

2605743,5,B000GEIREQ,"I watch this dvd over and over again.  One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.  If you're a Warhol fan this is a must see.  It's rich with information and vintage footage, with wonderful interviews with factory members and people associated with Warhol during the 50, 60 and 70s.",1231977600,2,285,4.66
2605744,3,B000GEIREQ,"Quite disappointed with this documentary. Considering that I'm very familiar with Warhol and his life, I was surprised at how boring the makers of this documentary made his life seem. Worst aspect of the documentary was the droning voice of the female narrator, quite literally lulled me to sleep. What happened to the fun, flamboyance, the entertainment in Warhol's life!!!!!!!",1213315200,5,378,5.316666666666666
2605745,5,B000GEIREQ,"This is a fantastic and informative documentary on the life and work of Andy Warhol.  This interpretation of his life makes the most sense to me.  The footage, images, and interviews are fantastic, although there is this one interviewee who occasionally tries to read into Warhol's work too much, but overall this is a fantastic guide to understanding why Warhol is the cultural phenomenon that he is.",1185580800,,401,4.970149253731344
2605746,4,B000GEIREQ,"I just received this in the mail and finally got to watch it. It is a very engaging and in-depth presentation of his life from early childhood to the late 60s. In fact it's the most in-depth documentary in the respects of his early life, pre-pop success, that I've seen. There are lots of great images and archival footage that otherwise you may not have a chance to see, but...

This documentary seems to focus mostly on the silver factory years, which lasted only from the early 60s to 1968, yet takes up most of the 4 hours of this film. Granted, those were arguably some of the most influential and important years of his career, but I wish this film contained more on his later life. The last 2 decades of his career, the 70s and 80s, took up only the last 20 minutes (credits included) of the whole 4 hours, which is only a brief summary. This is the only reason I decked one star off my rating, as the 70s and 80s are my personal favorite times in his career. There's always The Andy Warhol Diaries for that area though, which I would also recommend.

So, overall, I would recommend this to anyone interested in Andy, and to those who are already fans. Even though it's lacking in it's coverage of his later career, it excels in every other aspect, and I'm glad I got to see it.",1165017600,25,1285,4.327800829875518
2605747,5,B000GEIREQ,"This is the best portrait of an artist I've ever seen.  I was completely entralled by the film.  Because Warhol was both tremendously inventive and horribly cruel, I alternately felt a sense of awe and disgust.  Warhol's genius and callousness are both fleshed out.  Despite the turbulent content of the film, I was simply exhilerated throughout.

Having watched this excellent film, I feel a greatly enriched appreciation for Warhol's art---a sense of what it said, how it worked, and how it became a cliche.  (I was particularly ill-informed about Warhol's films, which were discussed in great detail.)

The Factory--where Warhol worked (but seldom played) and where transvestites, drifters, and creative spirits intermingled--is featured in healthy portions.  This locale comes across as one of those rare places in history where the geist of a era is spatially concentrated.  Here, in this one extraordinary place of production, Warhol and others fomented art and a vision of a post-Fordist world.  This film is essential viewing (like the Weather Underground or Berkeley in the Sixties) for those who want to ingest and comprehend the paradigm shift of the ""1960s.""

Warhol's cruel indifference to the self-destruction of those around him is critically revealed.  While some in the Factory drank and drugged themselves to death, Warhol passively watches, always remaining cool, detached, and voyeuristic.

The attempted homicide on Warhol, his commercialism, and his later years are all mentioned.  I would fault the film for not showing Warhol speak on film more often, for not really considering his cooptation by capitalism, and for skipping over his influence in art and in popular society.

I must admit though, that the film is brilliantly executed, and well worth your time and nickel.",1160438400,42,1797,5.30035335689046
2605778,5,B000GEIREQ,A wonderful Documentary Film on the life of Andy Warhol that is unique and timeless. It was my pleasure to have met him a year before his untimely death. He will always be remembered as the author of Pop Art and film.,1426896000,,217,4.190476190476191

2605781,5,B000GEIREQ,"Fascinating, well made film that really goes into what made Warhol great. Lots of background on his artistic ability which is usually passed over in favor of his Studio 54 days.

2605783,5,B000GEIREQ,One of the best documentaries ever made on an artist.  I am an art historian and I learned so much about Andy Warhol.  Ric Burns does an excellent job!  A must if you want to understand 20th century art!,1386806400,,203,4.153846153846154
2605784,5,B000GEIREQ,"I had the good fortune to meet Andy Warhol three separate times in the early and mid 1980's. Once at Studio 54, once at Leo Castelli Gallery and once at Gagosian Gallery when he showed the large ""piss paintings"" shortly before his unexpected and tragic death. I own three separate Warhol documentaries and somewhere around a dozen Warhol books. I would consider myself a Warhol aficionado. I have viewed this Warhol documentary at least fifty times. Each and every viewing brings newness; certain lines, images and footage lift off the television screen and demand my attention. It is rich in detail and completeness. And is wholly accurate, which could be it's greatest feature. Now consider that such a high level of accuracy and wholeness goes on for four hours. For Warhol fans, nothing could be better.

The doc starts at his earliest moments and recounts most of the hardship he endured in his poor Pittsburgh-Slavic upbringing. From the early death of his father to the child illness that left him forever pale-skinned with patchy color, Laurie Anderson narrates objectively and evenly as if she were the perfect voice-over to Andy's life. Most of the footage is real, in other words not stock footage inserted to 'illustrate' the script. Equally important, it fits accurately and sequentially in its chronology to the script. I was amazed at the sheer volume of Warhol footage, both moving and still imagery.

Interviews with critics, collectors, artists and dealers enrich the narration. This includes dated and periodic commentary captured during the 60's and 70's and also later interviews that appear to have been filmed specifically for this doc (I haven't seen, for example, the interview with Irving Blum anywhere else). I found Irving Blum's commentary to be the most enlightening and insightful of all the guest commentators. Which is quite fitting as it was Blum who first took a chance on Andy and was the first to promote him. Blum's commentary simply bowls me over in its prophetic and close insight as both friend and art dealer. One quick stat he mentions: Blum purchased the first set of 32 Campbell Soup Can paintings in 1962 for $1000. In 2004 he sold the very same set to the Museum of Modern Art for $15 million and accurately points out that because of its historic significance along with the fact this was a complete and first set, is most likely worth over $100 million today. And he's right. But for Blum, as with many others, including Billy Name, whose commentary was also unique and insightful, the monetary value of a Warhol painting is less interesting than the importance of the man.

Warhol, it could be argued, had the most amazing life a human being could have in the 20th century. Only Picasso can rival the magnificence of Andy's life. This is quite symbolic because, to me, we can divide the 20th century in half and say that Picasso owned the first half, while Warhol owned the second. And like Picasso, who the great sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said, ""an artist must either go through Picasso or around him"" we can say the same of Warhol. You either go around him or you must go through him. He's that important. More important than the abstract expressionists, more important than pop artists who enjoyed critical acclaim well before Warhol, like Johns and Rauschenberg. It was Warhol who married the photographic process to painting in such a direct and simple manner. Once he did, his output was astonishing. The content of his work, combined with its presentation, created a kind of philosophy, which is mentioned in the narration and also by interviewees.

Pivotal moments in his life, both tragic and wonderful, are discussed. Like his shooting, and near-death, by the disturbed Valerie Solanas and the enormous divide it caused in both his art and lifestyle. Like his return to painting and his trip to China in the early 70's. And his eventual death caused by the negligence and malpractice of staff at NYU Medical Center. If I have one criticism of this excellent documentary, it would be a shortchanged feeling regarding his last years from 1985 to 1987. He produced an astonishing number of works, even collaborated with Jean Michael Basquiat in a 1985 show at Castelli (where I met him for the second time). He seemed to be on the verge of significant new bodies of work some of which included The Last Supper series, the Camouflage paintings, the large self-portraits and the delightful small black-and-white 60's advertisements from newspapers and magazines (""Beatle boots"" and ""Repent for Your Sins"" come to mind). My other criticism is the ""voice"" of Andy Warhol, which was performed by Jeff Koons. It was nothing like Andy's voice first of all, and secondly it suggests a certain connectivity, as if Koons is our contemporary Warhol. Not. Koons is a mere shadow of Andy and in my opinion a complete and total fraud. I resent such implication.

There is one scene I will always enjoy: a very stuffy and serious art critic is interviewing Andy circa 1963. Behind him are the large Elvis silkscreens (his second show with Blum's Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles). He sits there with sunglasses on, though he's inside. The critic prods him to be forthright and 'talk serious' about his work. But Andy is aloof and in typical form, deliberately disengaged. As the interview progresses Andy insists he doesn't know the answer to the questions and asks that the critic say both the question and the answer to the question. The indignant critic is stunned as Warhol gradually begins to repeat each word and sentence, like children sometimes do to taunt. It was metaphoric for the man who was American society's greatest mirror. He was at once mocking this erudite critic and displaying his vacuous and profound perspective. That, it would come to pass, was the legacy & paradigm of Andy Warhol: his paintings were at once vacuous and deeply profound; simple yet complicated.

If you watch this documentary you will walk away, four hours later, a changed person. Even if you know his story. Even if you know his work. There is so much here I daresay even an expert will learn something. This is required viewing for any art student, hell, any artist. This is mandatory for all Warhol fans. And for those who hate him (yes such individuals indeed exist) it is even more mandatory.",1369699200,13,6335,4.8774373259052926
2605785,5,B000GEIREQ,"Truly, an incredible work. Its only flaw is its lack of serious treatment of Warhol's artistic output of the 70's and 80's. Burns should have added an additional hour to the film to overcome this shortcoming. Still, it doesn't get any better.......",1358035200,,248,4.928571428571429
2605786,4,B000GEIREQ,"You know what I did with this?  I carefully opened the plastic, took out the DVD, scanned the DVD, made a sticker, and then put it on a copy of ISHTAR, and gave it to my brother for Christmas.  HE HAD NO IDEA!!!!

The thing of it is, it was sort of an inside joke where we were giving eachother Ishtar for about 5 years.  I'm pretty sure there's a copy hidden somewhere in my guestroom that he's going to spring on me at some point.

And the funny part is that Ishtar, or at least the first hour of it, is pretty awesome.  Wardrobe of Love.  I mean, OK.

The DVD that originally came in this case was round and flat, and featured some freak's picture on it who looked like he got electrocuted.  If you like dudes like that who make stuff that looks like stuff that already exists and want to know if they had bad skin and were mamma's boys, you should get this movie.

2605787,4,B000GEIREQ,"You will definitely get your money's worth on this DVD if you purchase it here on Amazon.  It goes for 4 hours.  In the duration of watching, I broke down and cried a couple of times... This is a great film to add to a collection if you love Andy or are interested in artists.

I think PBS did a great job of covering some issues which motivated Andy, specifically his initial rejections from colleagues and potential lovers were hurtful to comprehend.  This collection doesn't go too much into Andy's relationship with his mother, unfortunately. The second part focuses on Andy's transformation from the advertising world onto the pop ""scene"" as a leader of his Silver Factory...  Finally tying things up with the event of his being shot by a delusional groupie, who felt he had too much control over her life.  That also is very emotional to sit through.  Well it seems Valerie Solanas gave Andy a good cooling-off? I did not perceive him to be calloused, or someone who used people; but apparently he had that reputation.  One thing for certain:  he became a nicer person.

I am not giving this documentary 5 stars because of the horrid narration.  The narrator was obviously pressed to cover too much information in too short of time.  As a result, her voice sounds hyper-vigilant, taking away from the spirit of this film. The director would have done better to use a someone with a softer tone, and more music back-up from the era.",1251676800,3,1437,4.658730158730159

8130983,5,B000GEIREQ,"Excellent. There are other Warhol documentaries but this is the one to own. It covers his life in detail, with interviews with all the key players. And it's not afraid to call out some his flaws as well as praise his achievements. The quality shows in little touches, like getting Jeff Koons to be the voice of Andy when reading from his diaries. I recommend also getting the Cale/Reed cd Songs for Drella as a musical companion to this documentary.",1510704000,,449,4.625

8130989,4,B000GEIREQ,"An intelligent, well made and lengthy (4 hours) documentary on one of the most controversial of modern artists.  An artist the film positions as unquestionably the greatest and most important of the 2nd half of the 20th century.

I had some reservations about how strongly the film came down on the genius side of the ledger (with that word genius being invoked seemingly every thirty seconds.)  But I will admit, as someone who was a bit of an agnostic about Warhol, the film did a good job of convincing me there was much more to his work than I had gleaned from the surface, and it raised my curiosity to revisit both his films and paintings.  I do wish that some more intelligently critical voices were given a bit more time to present their arguments,. Among the many talking heads here, some are deeply insightful and thought-provoking, but others are just sycophantic about Warhol and his legacy.

I will say, for such a 'familiar' figure on the cultural stage, I was surprised there was so much I didn't know about Warhol and the evolution of his work, and how his personal life intersected with that.  If the film rushes through the last decade of Warhols life, it really takes its time in investigating the personal and artistic roots of his concepts, and his immense drive to succeed.  I finished the film knowing and understanding a lot more about the man and his art than when I started.

My only other hesitation was the almost elegiac, funereal tone of the piece: almost Andy as martyred saint.  My sense of Warhol is that there was a great deal of life and humor in his work -- even in his carefully crafted public persona -- but that's a bit missing here.  Theres a little too much tortured Van Gough in this portrait, for an artist whose sense of playfulness about popular culture seems an important part of his work.

But these criticisms of personal taste aside, this was a film I was very glad to have seen, that never bored me despite its length, and helped me see a giant of 20th century art with fresh eyes.",1462492800,,2031,4.552197802197802
