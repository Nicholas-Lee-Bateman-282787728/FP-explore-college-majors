4885913,5,B005SQRYOG,Love this classic collection - and it contains my all-time favorite episode when the teacher comes to dinner!  I love to watch this as it is a reminder of the manners and respect we used to have in this world.,1343606400,13,209,4.225
4885914,5,B005SQRYOG,"Got this for my kids, since I used to watch it when was young.  They actually loved it and subjects were very relevant for them.  My kids are 6,6 and 8",1341532800,,151,3.838709677419355
4885915,5,B005SQRYOG,"I bought this for my Mom for Mother's Day. She is VERY, VERY, PLEASED with it and ENJOYED it VERY much.",1336608000,2,103,3.9523809523809526
4885916,4,B005SQRYOG,"This set is a great price. A lot of fun episodes from this series are included. My only beef is that ""In the Soup"" was not included in this set, and is probably the episode that most people remember.",1328572800,19,199,4.128205128205129
4885917,5,B005SQRYOG,"This is one of the classic shows from the olden days.
When I say I grew-up with this show, I mean it literally.
Jerry Mathers and I are the same age. His brother that didn't age much-- I guess --was a highschool student for
WAY-more than four years... on the show.
When Jerry ""Beaver Cleaver"" Mathers finished the eighth grade, he just wasn't the [same] cute little kid anymore,
and the series was cancelled just like Jay North's DENNIS THE MENACE.
Rumors circulated that Jerry died in Vietnam-- he never even went, but, I made it back okay... as did ""Mikey"" from
those LIFE CEREAL commercials.
Really GREAT show! A show from the days when you couldn't show a man and woman on a bed together--even if they WERE
married... TWIN/seperate beds... only.
Oh! And never mind the nudity part: didn't happen.
Among other ""firsts"", the first time we ever saw a TOILET, on television, it was on THIS show.
Innocence, indeed!

I'm no television scholar, nor am I all-knowing. I DO know that the price of this double-disc set is a steal!
Off the toppamyhead, I can recall what 18 of the twenty selections are from the title, alone. Seems from the
title, there's an episode--or two-- from each season!
