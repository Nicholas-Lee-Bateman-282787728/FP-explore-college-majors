8256131,3,B0014NV46G,"This two tape set is average
It's classic UWF footage that was distributed through this strange label/company
Both tape don't even reach the 2hr. mark
The footage itself looks pretty good for VHS quality
The biggest highlight of these set is getting early footage of Cactus Jack

THE LUMBERJACK MATCH is just that a 38 minute match one the first VHS tape
There's only one way to settle the fuming feud between Paul ""Mr. Wonderful"" Orndorff and UWF Champion Steve ""Dr. Death"" Williams: The Lumberjack Match. If either of the two combatants is tossed from the ring, the Lumberjacks throw him back before he can catch his breath! And check out these Lumberjacks: The Power Twins, Cowboy Bob Orton, Steve ""The Wild Thing"" Ray, Don ""The Rock"" Muraco, Chris Michaels, Carmine Galvano, Tom Brandi, Sunny Beach, and Cactus Jack.
The match is actually very good it's a stiff Japanese style match the lumberjacks around the ring make it more interesting  *** Star Match

TAG TEAM TANDEMS
Get ready for the Tag Team Extravaganza, where the meanest and mightiest wrestlers in the Universe join forces! Twice the power means twice the fury!
Plus more awesome matches! Four in the ring! Wild Man Jack Armstrong and Cactus Jack vs. Chief Jay Strongbow and David Sammartino. Dave Johnson and Jumpin' Joe Defuria vs. The Blackhearts.
Running Time: 45 Mins.  1 in a half star match this is 1980's Pro Wrestling it's average
.
This is a interesting time capsule from a Company that would get swallowed up by the AWA then would join NWA that would later evolve into WCW
More for the die hard collectors/Retro fans (Not sure if you'll see this footage uncut on the WWE Network They might not even own this footage
Would've been better to get legit real UWF tv taping footage in a long form not just a cheap greatest hits compilation  4/10",1455148800,,1817,4.737341772151899
