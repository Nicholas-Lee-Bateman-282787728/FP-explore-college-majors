8513691,5,B0001D7P2C,"Dude, this cartoon is amazing. The Wheres Waldo cartoon may never get released on dvd but atleast I can enjoy it still while there are awesome sellers out there on amazon. If you've never seen this cartoon and grew up in the 80's or 90's, it's well worth your time to check it out.",1305158400,,281,4.222222222222222
