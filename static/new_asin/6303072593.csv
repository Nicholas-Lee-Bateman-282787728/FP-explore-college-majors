554775,5,6303072593,"When I was growing up, my father would sing the hymn ""Stars in my Crown"" -the theme song from his favorite movie.  I never had the chance to see the movie until after he had passed away and when I finally had the chance to see it I was thrilled.  This movie grabbed at my heart.  Each of the characters are so rich, you almost know them.  You struggle right along beside them. You will experience their laughter, their pain, their anger, their shame and ultimately their hope. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  It is certainly one for all the family to see from the youngest to the oldest.  Rarely is such a quality movie made anymore.  I too wish I could give it more than a 5 star rating.",1170547200,5,702,4.2727272727272725
554776,5,6303072593,"Thank God for Turner Classic Movies channel otherwise I may not have seen this gem. It helps to check the classics schedule on their website sometimes months in advance to record movies that are not out on DVD and overpriced/unavailable on VHS.

This story of redemption is one of McCrea's best movies. McCrea was a natural - he practiced what he preached even in real life. Married to the same woman for more than 50 years, he gained the reputation of an honest business-man who made his fortune in real estate.",1123200000,6,512,4.626373626373627
554777,5,6303072593,"Orson Welles' definition of movies as a ""ribbon of dreams"" helps account for cinema's special hold on human consciousness.  To return to a film that we may remember seeing as children is more than revisiting the past: it's reexperiencing the actual moment of wonder that was ours the first time we saw the film.

""Stars in My Crown"" is a film that has stayed with me since I saw it at Rockford, Illinois' proud Coronado Theater over 50 years ago.  It's a first-rate ""B"" movie by a director who excelled at making such pictures--Jacques Tournier.  I suspect that my lifelong attraction to the movie had more to do with the star (Joel McRae, as a tough yet gentle preacher) and the hymn providing the title (after seeing the movie I began to search every church hymnal for ""Stars in My Crown,"" usually with disappointing results) than with the director's resourceful style (only in recent years have I become aware of Tourneur as a creative filmmaker, thanks to Scorcese's praise of him).

The film's achievement is to combine pastoral elegy (it foregrounds the narrator's memory of a nostalgic time and community) with singular realism in its portrayal of race relations in the South.  In fact, it ""humanizes"" the Klan while making them redeemable.  In the film's remarkable climax they're transformed by the power of the ""Word"" from murderous, rampaging brigands into chastened stars in the preacher's crown.

But even with its inflammatory racial theme, the more interesting subtext is the story's representation of the conflict between science and religion.  The preacher and doctor, in effect, become engaged in rivalry for the town's affections.  When the doctor stems the typhoid epidemic, he's embraced by the town as its new hero.  Ultimately, however, it is the preacher who reclaims his flock when he identifies the source of the biological plague and then administers to the souls of those affected by the even more threatening disease of racial hatred.

Apart from narrative specifics, ""Stars in My Crown"" rises to unmistakable archetypal significance.  It's a story of initation and experience, life and death, marriages and funerals, and above all of faith in the human spirit.  Certainly no title could be more apt for a little movie that, no matter how you cut it, is a real gem.",1120608000,31,2294,4.971204188481676
554778,5,6303072593,"This is my favorite movie of all time. In todays movie market it is so rare that we find a movie that the whole family can enjoy, and this is one of our favorites!  I've let all my friends watch it, and they love it too.  I'm thinking about buying a few copies for Christmas presents.",1087776000,5,284,4.053571428571429
554779,4,6303072593,"There is a rural vision of America that is seen only in Hollywood or comic books.  In this America, the majority of the inhabitants are the good, decent, sort who value family, tradition, and honor.  The miscreants who intrude on this vision make no lasting mark on the lives of the good countryfolk.  In STARS IN MY CROWN, director Jacques Tourneur depicts a post Civil war small town whose inhabitants look to their trusted elderly doctor (Lewis Stone) to care for their bodies and to an equally trusted parson (Joel McCrea) to care for their souls.  What is startling is Tourneur's use of a rarely used device in film, the omniscient narrator (Marshall Thompson), who as an adult reviews his life and his earlier boyish self, well played by child actor Dean Stockwell.  Despite the frequent use of this narration, the pace never drags nor does it intrude heavy-handedly.
The plot revolves around the twin tragedies of a typhoid epidemic that sweeps through the town killing indiscriminately and the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan as it tries to intimidate a proud black man (Juano Hernandez) into selling his valuable land for peanuts to the local Klan bigshot (Ed Begley).  Into this maelstrom lies a subplot of the antagonism between the doctor son of the town's much respected physician (Charles Kemper) and the Parson (McCrea).  Through the typhoid outbreak, the viciousness of the Klansmen, and the general slow-paced life of the villagers are the thoughts of the mature narrator often commenting on himself and the passing scene.
Most of the film is really a kaleidoscopic peek into a past that, outside the media, never really existed.  The tragedy of typhus is real enough, however, as the audience feels the pain of the loss even when the survivors bravely shake their heads at their acceptance of the inscrutable will of God.  The climactic confrontation between the parson and the Klan does not ring true as director Tournreur tries to make the viewer believe that beneath the white sheets of the Klan beats a heart that can be reached by shame.  Still, movies like STARS IN MY CROWN reach the audience in such a way as to once again show the potency of the screen to make tragedy more human and evil more amenable to being touched by humanity.",1078617600,6,2257,4.808785529715762
554780,5,6303072593,"'Stars in My Crown' is over 50 years old, yet in it's humor, it's message of brotherhood, and it's depiction of small-town Western America at a time when religion was the true center of everyone's lives, this film has rarely been equaled!
The story is told through the observations of young John Kenyon (sensitively portrayed by Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell, with Daktari's Marshall Thompson voicing Kenyon as an adult), who lives with Soldier-turned-Minister Josiah Dozier Grey (Joel McCrea, in one of his finest performances) and his wife, Harriet (Ellen Drew). Grey is kind, warm, and totally sincere, with a penchance for telling funny stories with a Message, rather than being 'preachy'...in short, the kind of Parson who can win hearts, as well as souls!
Grey's congregation includes some of Hollywood's finest character actors, including Lewis Stone (Judge Hardy) as a crusty old doctor, James Mitchell (Days of Our Lives) as his doubting physician son, Alan Hale (The Adventures of Robin Hood) as a Civil War buddy with a large family (including 'Matt Dillon' James Arness!), Amanda Blake (who would costar with Arness in 'Gunsmoke') as the schoolmarm, Arthur Hunnicutt (The Big Sky) as a local character nicknamed 'Chloroform'(!), Oscar-winner Ed Begley as a rich mine owner, and, in a remarkable performance, Juano Hernandez as 'Famous Uncle Prill', a Black farmer who experiences with dignity the racism of the time.
Director Jacques Tourneur, best-known for his gothic classic 'Cat People', shows patience and restraint, allowing the story to build under its own steam, which gives the climaxes (a typhoid epidemic and a Klan near-lynching) an emotional wallop. McCrea's scene with the incensed Klan members foreshadows Gregory Peck's confrontation with the lynch party in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', and is truly unforgettable.
'Stars in My Crown' is a rich, wonderful film that your family will cherish. It is on the short list of my favorite films, and is one that you can enjoy for years to come!",1038873600,68,2010,5.187692307692307
554781,5,6303072593,"The first time I saw this movie, I loved it.  Parson Gray is a great character who preaches without fear, stops bullies, and combats racism in his town.  It doesn't matter how old this movie is, it still has a good message that Hollywood doesn't deliver anymore! All the characters in the film are acted well, so if you enjoy a preacher that tells it like it is and good acting I recommend this movie.  It is a great family film to watch over and over.  It makes you wish that moviemakers would go back to making these types of films; films that present morals with their stories.  If I could, I'd give it seven stars.",1019088000,5,618,4.293103448275862

He was very picky in choosing the movies he starred in..  He was a very clean and wholesome man who remained married to his wonderful wife (his only wife) for 57 years.

Tens of thousands of young Americans were watching this and perhaps it was the first time they have been exposed to what America really was like!""

The black and white filming which was certainly a budget issue when the movie was made only adds to the story lending a feeling of simplicity to the town's people and the isolation of the setting. The writing,direction, and acting draw you into the lives of the characters and the impact of the climax will rend your heart.

Stars in My Crown, 1950, is a true gem.  This screenplay is based on a Louis L'Amour story and McCrea is wonderful in this movie.  There are many other titles of McCrea Westerns worth noting like, Stranger on Horseback, Border River, Black Horse Canyon, Lone Hand just to name a few.  Worth watching.",1313712000,3,458,4.604938271604938
555347,4,6303072593,"Viewers who enjoy traditional black and white Joel McCrea type westerns with no psychological, sociological, or historical analyses and no clever dialogue will like this 1957 movie where McCrae rides into town disguised as a drifter while, in truth, he is employed by the Western Union and sent to this town to stop a recent surge of stage coach robberies. There is the usual daughter of a prominent man, in this case the sheriff, who thinks McCrae is a bad man, who tries to persuade her father not to hire him as a deputy, and as usual, she protests too much, and it is clear that she is, even if she doesn't know it yet, very much attracted to him and he to her.

 The villain in this film is vicious; he kills many unarmed people; yet there is an aura of niceness to him. He steals because he grew up wanting to play the piano, learnt to play quite well, but couldn't take more lessons to become the best he could be because he couldn't afford the cost. Now, he is drawn to pianos and starts to play, but stops when someone hears his music and he becomes angry. This situation begs for psychological analysis but this was not the style of such films in 1957.",1311638400,,1162,4.350230414746544

555349,5,6303072593,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""STARS IN MY CROWN"" (1950) (89 min/B&W) -- Starring Joel McCrea, Ellen Drew, Dean Stockwell, Alan Hale, Lewis Stone, James Mitchell & Amanda Blake

Directed by Jacques Tourneur

Civil War veteran Josiah Grey (Joel McCrea) comes to a small town to be a gospel minister. In time he has a family and many friends, but he also finds friction with a few of his parishioners. A young doctor grates at what he feels is the parson's interference in the scientific treatment of patients, and a mine owner resents Grey's protection of an old sharecropper whose small plot of land stands in the way of his continued mining. Grey must face a public health crisis and a lynch mob as a result, all seen and described through the eyes and memory of Grey's young nephew John

Director Jacques Tourneur, shows patience and restraint, allowing the story to build under its own steam .  Giving the climaxes a typhoid epidemic and a Klan near-lynching, an emotional wallop.  Joel McCrea as the take charge parson is understated as always, but never hogs the spotlight and seems to have a great respect for The Story.  McCrea's scene with the incensed Klan members foreshadows Gregory Peck's confrontation with the lynch party in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', is truly an unforgettable moment in this wonderful film.

Must make mention that acting honors go to the fabulous Juano Hernandez as Uncle Famous, a peaceful black man who refuses to give in to racial intimidation in his own easy-going way --- The ending packs a wallop. Won't soon forget the truly haunting image of those two blank sheets of paper thought to be the last will and testament of Uncle Famous', being swept along in the wind. It may not be Uncle Famous' after all, but as McCrea states with utter conviction, ""It's God's Will.""

Wonderful score by award winning composer Adolph Deutsch.
