4887692,3,B005SYZZ94,"Typical '70s film.  If you like James Coburn and '70s movie mores and music, you will like this film.  Not a really difficult mystery to solve, nor a really complex plot, but Coburn does a great job as always and the fashions and cars are fun to look at.",1416873600,,254,4.163265306122449

4887694,5,B005SYZZ94,"James Coburn was excellent in this film. He plays the romantic lead and a smart pathologist. I love all of Coburn's films, but this one is my favourite. I'll keep this movie forever.",1410307200,,182,4.545454545454546
4887695,5,B005SYZZ94,This is a great James Colburn  movie.  It is very 70's retro ---but that is the charm and appeal of this movie.  It is well casts and well directed!  This is a movie ever retro movie lover needs in their personal collection.  *I highly recommend this as a very enjoyable movie and 70's era flash-back!,1404691200,,301,4.4
4887696,3,B005SYZZ94,"The (often) great Blake Edwards seems to be on auto-pilot w/ this luke warm medical/detective mish-mash. I waited 40 years to see this movie (since I saw the ads when I was a kid) - I finally got to watch it, about two months ago, and I've forgotten most of it already.",1370476800,,269,4.1923076923076925
4887697,4,B005SYZZ94,"James Coburn was perfectly cast as the new, hip Pathologist in a hospital cloaked with skeletons in every ward.  Although he did not rise to ""A List"" fame he nonetheless delivers a topnotch performance blending sarcastic wit and intelligence as the newly hired Pathologist who locks horns with the Hospital's CEO and Chief Surgeon....add a delicious Jennifer O'Neill as curious yet vulnerable Hospital Chief of Dietary services, a Med School chum (who is implicated in the death of the CEO's wayward daughter), and a host of familiar faced actors and you have a fun, exciting 70's soap opera.  Coburn, with his gangly stature, baritone voice and gritty smiles, delivers his lines with the sharpness of a surgeon's scapel and the playfulness of a man who is in control of his every emotion.  The romance with O'Nell is sincere, confident and they manage to create credible chemistry between each other (no Bogart-Bacall sizzle however, this IS the free-love 70's!) Despite the predictable ending I really enjoyed the journey back to 1972 and fondly remember the bobbed hair styles, long sideburns, tight bell-bottoms and the way hospital life was: an endless parade of white-coated inhabitants, conversations throwing around anatomical and biochemistry terms, the controlled chaos of this environment and the true mysteries that unfold on a daily basis. I am not ashamed to say I enjoyed this film (and was delighted to find it available after almost 40 years!)",1348790400,5,1460,5.151898734177215
4887698,3,B005SYZZ94,"Actor James Coburn was always great in action roles and once in a while he graduated to detective or everyman roles which sometimes worked.  This film 'THE CAREY TREATMENT'-1972 unfortunately doesn't.  The film sure has its share of great faces from the seventies: James Hong, Skye Aubrey, Regis Toomey, John Hillerman, Pat Hingle, Dan O'Herlihy and Michael Blodgett among others.  The lead actress is Jennifer O'Neill who tries to maintain dignity among the dull storylines. The direction is by Blake Edwards which is an unusual choice since he was more of a comedic director and after viewing this film, it seems anyone could have led the parade.  Coburn plays Dr. Carey who joins a hospital medical staff and gets involved with the murder of the hospital's CEO's daughter.  It's passed off as a botched abortion job but closer examination reveals deliberate murder.  Coburn takes the 108 minute running time trying to prove the innocence of one of his colleagues accused of the murder.  You would think out of all the Giallo and suspense thrillers being made at that time in Europe and also the states that Edwards would try to bring a little bit of suspense to the proceedings but this is not to be. The camerawork and music are strictly by the numbers.  What emerges is a routine, dull excursion suited to the Hallmark or Lifetime television channels.  It's so tedious that when the killer is revealed at the climax, who cares?  I had the honor of meeting Ms. O'Neill when I worked at a music store in White Plains NY in the mid eighties.  She had a horse farm there and used to frequent the store for records, she loved progressive rock and jazz.  She had nice memories of this shoot and talked about her times in Europe afterwards.  Warner Archive releases it in a nice 2.35 transfer with no extras but the mind boggles why the widescreen process was used at all when it resembles a TV movie of the week. For James Coburn completists only.",1325548800,11,1946,4.705014749262537

8485646,5,B005SYZZ94,"The Carey Treatment was released in 1972 It stars Jennifer O'Neill  with good support from Michael Blodgett.  A great murder mystery set in a hospital ! Fans of Jennifer O""Neill will like this the most.",1500768000,,202,4.742857142857143
8485647,1,B005SYZZ94,"I wanted to see this bx my family had come across the filming back in 70s by the Charles River, Boston. We stopped to watch on an overcast Sunday on our way out to eat in Cambridge Mass.  Surprisingly,  we were only onlookers . However,  that scene was not included in final cut. Hokey totally 70s movie. But did enjoy laughing at some scenes that included things that totally would not fly in 2017. Good for those who enjoy period pieces but unless you are a huge James Coburn fan or lived in Boston in 70s , pass on this one.",1493424000,,527,4.198019801980198

8485650,5,B005SYZZ94,"I really liked this 70s realism Michael Crichton medical thriller.  This has to be an earlier one (although, I also love 'Coma').  The musical theme is terrific.  The chemistry between James and Jennifer is there - her character is fun, and he has some sharp lines.  The Boston setting and scenery also add nice flavor.  James was also fun in his other films form the 70's - The Last of Sheila and The Dain Curse!",1465862400,,413,4.453333333333333
8485651,4,B005SYZZ94,Love these old James Coburn films.  Good story but find it funny how a doctor can turn detective and not get fired for not doing his job.,1454889600,,137,4.074074074074074

Shot in Boston, my home town once apron a time, I enjoyed it and have wanted it to be a part of my library for quite some time now. Its a murder mystery surrounded around a supposed abortion which was illegal at the time the movie was made. its a welcome addition to my library. Its an upper quality B movie.",1430352000,,359,3.9315068493150687
