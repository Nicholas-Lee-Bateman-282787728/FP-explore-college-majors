8101901,4,B000CSTK5G,"A&E documents the ultimate sacrifice as one man gives up his life for his career in AMERICAN JUSTICE: THE DONNIE BRASCO STORY. Popularized by the best-selling novel and movie, this tale of an undercover FBI agent caught in the crime world is a study in patience. Joseph Pistone originally planned on conducting a six-month investigation posing as a thief, but his job became his reality as the case stretched into five years. Pistone adopted the persona of Donnie Brasco, a successful jewel thief who was looking to ""get connected."" He slowly and carefully ingratiated himself with a group of gangsters and was about to be initiated as a member when his assignment ended. Successfully earning the trust of many high-ranking ""wise guys,"" he was able to expose the activities of several important families, including the Bonannos and the Colombos. His step-by-step explanations detail a dysfunctional clan beset with infighting. Eventually, Pistone's testimony led to the conviction of several Mafia men. This 50 minutes documentary presents his story, and then A&E follows up by interviewing officers still caught in the undercover game.

The story of ""Donnie Brasco"" Joseph Pistone is one of the most fascinating you'll ever find, and this episode of AMERICAN JUSTICE will be a great addition to any collection. If, like me, you really enjoy watching documentaries about The Mob/Organized Crime then you'll have a great time watching this DVD. Learn more about how Pistone created this character, learn how his entire life changed because of the operation, learn how he was able to become friend with some of the most dangerous men living in New York at the time, and so much more. The movie was great; this documentary, the real story, is even better. The only thing disappointing about this documentary is that it's only 50 minutes long. Highly recommended. :)
