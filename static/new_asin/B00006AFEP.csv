1735713,5,B00006AFEP,"This DVD set is packed with more than Stolen Summer and the Project Greenlight series.
I made the mistake of viewing it with my default DVD sofware. Instead install the InterActual software (included on the DVD's) and you will get MUCH MOORE (<punn intended).  With my computer connected to the internet, it will go to enhanced viewing of Project Greenlight that adds special information to the screen as you watch some of the shows.  Next, I have not been able to beat the trivia game included on the DVD.  Chris Moore gets me every time.
You get links to the script notes made by all of the Key people in the series.  I watched Stolen Summer once in normal mode, and then twice in the commentary mode which includes the comments and humor of Chris Moore, Jeff Balis, and Pete Jones which was hilarious.  You will see that the Project Greenlight series does not on its own reflect the true chemistry between these three guys.  Plus you will also get to find out some of the not-so-easy to spot bloopers that remain un-cut from the finished film.  Another feature I like was watching Stolen Summer, and if JUMP-TO-SCENE was on, I clicked on the screen during certain parts of the movie, and it would pause the movie, then play the respective part of the Project Greenlight show that dealt with the filming of that scene.
It was nice to see all the top 10 winners scene submissions and videographies.
The Chris Moore Challenge is worth the cost of the set!  Ben affleck is hiollarious.  Stolen Summer has its own reviews and gets my recommendation.
I highly recommend the entire 4-disk series.  Even if you saw the show on HBO, you will get much moore out of this DVD set. This is only my 10th DVD so far, but none of the others had features equal to this one.  MIRAMAX did a good job with content, though I find navigating through the menus a little frustrating. I look forward to downloading a few of the commentaries by Pete Jones that  did not have time to do yet.",1042243200,6,1967,4.49438202247191
1735714,5,B00006AFEP,"Watching this one-disaster-after-another reality show, I can't help but wonder if Pete Jones realizes just how lucky he is and how much scrutiny he's under. I mean, he's been pushy, demanding and silly on the set. He's not following a shot schedule or taking advice from anyone, particularly Chris Moore (who comes off in this show as a sort of wiseass, common-sense-spouting hero).
Incidentally, did you count how many drinks Ben Affleck had in the first episode? No wonder they sent him to rehab.
""Stolen Summer,"" which had a script that Matt Damon said sounded too much like an afterschool special, looks like it's going to be painful to sit through, but this show makes me want to suffer through it.",1040169600,,703,4.818181818181818
1735715,4,B00006AFEP,"All I can say is that this movie... and I haven't seen the DVD series but did watch the stresses of the ""behind the scenes"" production on HBO ... was excellent!!!
And congratulations go out to Pete Jones!  Great movie!  Nicely shot.  Great story line.  And had the innocence of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Usually I fall asleep on the couch.  Not this time... I was in tears by the end.
Acting wise and writing wise.... there were a couple of events that I thought jolted the movie without a previous motivation... Aiden Quinn's character... however overall... excellent. Highly recommend the whole package.  The little boy's acting was excellent as well.  All should be proud.  A movie with real moments.  Word should be out targeting the family audience!
Hope to see Pete Jones grow in his role as a writer and director!",1039651200,2,821,4.678321678321678
1735716,5,B00006AFEP,"After reading the so-so reviews, all I can say is to each their own.  If you are a filmmaker, interested in the film industry...this four DVD set is jam-packed!
First, let's talk about DVD 2-3.  The Project Greenlight twelve episode series.  I literally couldn't stop after each episode, I literally wanted to keep watching all episodes in one sitting and I did.  You really get a good behind-the-scenes look at the making of a film.  Sure, probably not in-depth that people would like but nevertheless a really good behind-the-scenes look at the making of ""Stolen Summer"" and the difference of opinions and the stress that goes on.  You literally can feel it.
DVD 4.  This DVD is packed with video entries from the top competitors in the contest from their personal videos of why they should be selected to the top 10's short films and more.  There is also the act like Chris Moore competition and of course Project Redlight and also advice.  There is just so much stuff on this fourth DVD.  I've been a vistor of the Project Greenlight Website since this competition and it is great to see the competitor videos included on the DVD.
And DVD 1.  This includes ""Stolen Summer"" movie, deleted scenes, director and producer's commentary.
I don't know...I pretty much looked at this video like the many filmmaking books that I have and saw it more as a really good investment.  It's like how many filmmakers purchase ""El Mariachi"" for Rodriguez's filmmaking advice (and his cool book), this is also a worthy purchase.
With all four DVD's packed with so much and for the price I got it for, I don't see how you can go wrong with this DVD.  Definitely worth buying!",1037318400,12,1660,4.682758620689655
1735717,1,B00006AFEP,"The show was a very interesting foray into the movie-making business.  However, the movie itself flat out [was bad].  It was worse than ""Reindeer Games"".  And I think we can all agree that ""Reindeer Games"" was a pretty bad movie.  I'd be embarassed to put my name on that piece of ...  If Pete Jones is the future of filmmaking, I weep for the future.",1034553600,2,351,4.338461538461538
1735718,4,B00006AFEP,"I've worked in documentary film production for a couple decades now, and while I'd definitely recommend this entire package (I devoured the four disks in a day), it should not be considered complete without reading the ""Bylines"" at the Project Greenlight website at <deleted>. As seems inevitable with modern ""reality television"" (when's somebody going to acknowledge the difference between reality and realism?), the feature filmmakers complain that the episodes in the television program were grossly distorted for exaggerated drama.
This DVD set contains the 12-part HBO series following the Project Greenlight experience start to finish, misc extras, and the entire feature film that resulted, titled ""Stolen Summer"". I found that observing the process was terrifically enlightening and quite inspiring. It's valuable as a privileged peek at a major production effort, and a demonstration of how tough it is behind the scenes. Apparently, students interviewed after the program felt they were less interested in pursuing film production as a career (seeing how complicated and stressful it really is), but it would have had the opposite effect on me when I was starting out. I found it most of all to demystify (demythify?) the feature film industry, and to show it as a real process carried out by real people. That's a huge hurdle to overcome to people considering any part of this business.
I was a bit disappointed on one level with the lack of insight to the actual creative strategies of the director, the cinematographer and the editor, admittedly a much harder thing to illustrate and perhaps less accessible for the hovering video crew. Because of that, I think this HBO television program is most of all an observation of the difficulties of film producing.
The producer of the feature seems to have taken some public lumps from his portrayal on the show, but I have to say what I saw was quite subdued in some of my experience, even in documentary production. Like the other participants, the program does show that they were all reacting to unfolding events during production with the intention of improving the workflow and/or the final product. Showing the shifting pressures of the process seems to be what the entire effort was about, and why it's such a valuable experience to watch happen.
This first Project Greenlight television program is much more a case study of producing than anything else. They have already begun the next contest, and I hope instead of recreating the same views again with a different group, the next HBO series focuses more specifically on the thought processes of the other creative participants. Still, if you have any interest in film production on any practical level, you shouldn't miss this program.",1034553600,6,2754,5.122222222222222
1735719,5,B00006AFEP,I watched the series on HBO and loved it. How can anyone not love this? It has alot of extra features including the Chris Moore challenge which is hilarious.,1034035200,,157,4.448275862068965
1735720,5,B00006AFEP,"What started as a simple Internet contest transformed into one of the most acclaimed reality series to hit cable for quite some time.  Pete Jones was the winner and was given the opportunity to direct his film, ""Stolen Summer.""  Sounds easy, right?  WRONG!
With these episodes, you get to see all the drama, all the battles, and all of the controvercy that took place during the filming of ""Stolen Summer.""  From casting complications to the infamous beach incident, they're all here, uncut and uncensored.
I for one really enjoyed the series.  It was a look into directing that I had never witnessed before.  I never knew how complicated and stressful it is for the director, even when it comes to getting ONE scene into the can!
This spectacular DVD package includes four disks.  On these disks you will find twelve episodes, the full length movie ""Stolen Summer,"" and a disk full of all sorts of extras and goodies.
The disks go something like this:
Disk One:  The complete film ""Stolen Summer,"" with extra features that include audio commentary from the director, co-producer and producer Chris Moore, the theatrical trailer, 2 deleted scenes (with choice of commentary or no commentary), and Pete Jones' ""Project Greenlight"" scene vs. the final film.  I highly recommend the full length commentary.  It's funny and informative at the same time.
Disk Two:  Episodes 1-6.  (Or Episodes 101-106, if you want to be more accurate.)
Disk Three: Episodes 7-12.  (Or Episodes 107-112, if you would like again to be more accurate.)
Disk Four:  A bonus disk with tons of extras that include notable filmmaker videos from the contest, the Top 10 videos, Top 10 ""Where are they now"" videos, ""The Chris Moore Challenge,"" the Top 10 3-minute scenes from the Top 3 contestants, and lessons from ""Project Greenlight"" that you didn't get to see on the show.  ""The Chris Moore Challenge"" is guaranteed to get a laugh out of you, especially when you see Ben Afleck's impression.  The extended lessons were also interesting and funny, especially Kevin Smith's conversation with Pete.  There's some great filmmaking tips in it if you're interested.
Note:  Since this was broadcasted on HBO, all of the strong language is in it, so it's not really recommended for younger viewers.  The language can get pretty intense at times, but it adds to the realistic element of filmmaking.  Not to mention it's funny as hell at times.  (If you thought Afleck and Damon had potty mouths in ""Goodwill Hunting......"")
I really enjoyed ""Project Greenlight.""  And I'm glad they released the complete series on DVD.  Again, if you like the series and want the movie as well, DO NOT BUY THE MOVIE SEPARATELY!  The movie already comes with the series.  It was quite remarkable to see how the movie evolved from all of the battles and controvercy.  I was a little worried about the movie, because there was a lot of drama that went on during the filming, but the movie turned out really good.  (I'll write a seperate review of the movie ""Stolen Summer"" VERY shortly.)  Forget ""Survivor,"" this is the ultimate reality series!  Filled with over 6 hours of bonus material, the ""Project Greenlight"" DVD package is a must-have for anyone who loved the show.  It's also a great show for those who are new to it.  I can't wait for the new season, and I hope it comes to HBO very soon.",1033171200,37,3341,4.8087719298245615

1735768,2,B00006AFEP,I didn't like the way this dvd was set up.  It was very difficult to play and did not have a good time or relaxing time watching it.  I was exhausted at the end of the showing.  I haven't watched this but the one time.  It could have been presented in a lot easier format.,1364601600,,272,3.890909090909091
1735769,5,B00006AFEP,"I love this movie, the cast ALL did a very good job.  The relationship between the two boys and the Rabbi was portrayed in a manner that should make all viewers stop and realize that Jesus is no respecter of people.

1735770,4,B00006AFEP,"First let me say that I like this film because of the cast, The way the film came into being, and what it sets out to achieve, which is to illustrate the unnecessary divide between two great religions of the book, and to show that friendship can bridge the gap of understanding. As the writer's first film, this isn't bad but, considering the subject matter, it lacks the depth that a more experienced writer might give it. This film only skims the surface of the theme of misunderstanding between religions, and the talented cast clearly know this. Aidan Quinn, as the working class stiff Catholic, turns in his performance by mail, and Kevin Pollack, as Rabbi Jacobson, appears to be hanging around the set waiting for the director to shout ""action"". Mike Weinberg, as Danny Jacobson, the Rabbi's eight year old son, is natural and charming, but he is not stretched either.

This story has great potential, and the cast, including Brian Dennehy, are always worth watching. But the movie needs a new director and some major rewrites.",1360627200,,1034,4.808988764044944

1735790,5,B00006AFEP,"There are times after I have seen a movie, I say to myself ""I wonder how could they have made this film?"", ""Who the producer who took a risk on this script?"", ""Why didn't they get such and such an actor for that role?"" or ""Why did they have such a down ending?"". After viewing the first season of HBO's Project Greenlight on four dvds, I have a better concept of filmmaking nad the process involved behind the scenes.

I have read Jerry Lewis's the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Total-Film-Maker/dp/039446236X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Total Film-Maker.</a>and understand the basic concepts of how the film starts from the script to final production. If you find a copy, read it!

Here in this documentary DVD set is director Pete Jones's  filmmaking odyssey from being a novice screen writer (selected from an on line script contest) to selection of his script Stolen Summer (with producers Ben Affleck, Chris Moore & Matt Damon) greenlighted by Miramax. Then Jones had to make a budget and rewriting his script to fit his budget and not lose his cinematic vision. After that, there was the process of locations, casting actors, filming, to  editing his final print. Jones's film education is well documented in this mini series.

To see it on DVD, you have a better chance to digest this series and Jones's filmmaking expierences...because you are with him for the journey as camera is on him personally and his cinematic vision. It is not always a positive or happy expierence. Sometimes you see the deals and the compromises you make, when making a movie

There are guests along the way like Jay Leno, Kevin Smith, Harvey Weinstein, and many others  filling the twelve week series.

Included in this four disk DVD package is Pete Jones's final released cut of his film Stolen Summer with  his audio commentary.

This DVD set shows what it takes to make films. since this is a small budget film, you can picture the bigger hassles that the large multi million dollar epic must go through...What an eduction this DVD series really is.

 This is worth viewing for the filmmaker, the film student, the film buff and those people who like to understand better the process of filmmaking. However, it is also amazing journey for those who like reality television.

To watch the process is something that we all should view and this is a first rate showcase. This DVD set shows the real HOLLYWOOD from the hype that it usually shows

The extra features of the fourth disk shows the producers can poke fun at themselves and well as educate, So watch and learn

1735791,5,B00006AFEP,"After the first two seasons I formed a conspiracy theory about project greenlight which I no longer support. For some time I believed digital cameras and video editing software might be seen as a threat to the film industry and that Project Greenlight was a propaganda tool devised by the Hollywood community to be used to discourage competition. This sounds absurd now but really the show does look like that. I remember reading scripts during the contest and every single one of the scripts I reviewed were better than the ones that made it to the finals. I couldn't understand how Stolen Summer was picked as the winner of the contest. But that's okay because the show itself is the movie, as far as I'm concerned. I hate the movie Stolen Summer but I LOVE the series. I've watched this entire series 4 times since I bought it but only suffered through the actual movie once and then I watched it with the commentary track so it would be worth my time. I think Pete Jones and the others are better characters than any he wrote for the film. Pete kind of reminded me of a character like Barney from the Andy Griffith show. He seemed like someone who thought he was cooler and more important than he really was. Great set, just skip the bad movie.",1189123200,,1248,4.502202643171806
1735792,1,B00006AFEP,"This was an amateur film competition which produced one of the most offensive films ever made.  Let's go over the list.

  Ben Affleck, a Catholic from Boston.  Pete Jones, a Catholic from Chicago, whose older brother is a Catholic priest working in Catholic-Jewish relations for the Vatican.

  What's the subject of Pete's script?

  A young Catholic boy decides he has to help a non-Catholic get into heaven, so he announces a plan to go to a synagogue, find a poor Jewish boy who isn't going to heaven, and allow him the good fortune of converting to Catholicism.

  That's a great plan - if you're Catholic and don't understand much outside of your own narrow framework of the universe.

  If you're Jewish...  all you want to do is pretend this film never happened.",1174003200,3,771,4.712121212121212
1735793,5,B00006AFEP,"This is a worthy series for aspiring movie directors/screenwriters, it shows the in and outs of the business and how much sway some have (Affleck, Damon) and others do not (all involved w/o recognizable faces).  It is a crude business and I suppose you have to be crude to play the game, but I found myself often peeved at the winner, Pete, because he was so instantly cocky and self-assured, and maybe he did have to fight to make his ""vision"" (which ultimately bombed), and I'm thrilled that they would even give the opportunity to someone, but in the end, I wished it wasn't this gentleman who had won such an amazing opportunity.",1137283200,,633,4.601769911504425
1735794,4,B00006AFEP,"I saw season two before I saw this one. The movie ""Stolen Summer"" is actually a superior film to that of ""The Battle of Shaker Heights"",but the reality series detailing the filmmaking process is strangely lacking. I still would recommend this dvd package for any aspiring filmmakers who want to understand the process of filmmaking, I just thought the second season made better viewing.",1122076800,,386,5.046875
1735795,5,B00006AFEP,"I think almost anyone would enjoy these DVDs.  There is plenty to enjoy in this huge 4 disc set.  The episodes are exciting and well edited and leave you wanting them to bring on the next episode.  I had not seen any of season 1, but I did see a few episodes of season 2 and hated the directors.  The writer/director in this first season was good.  The movie was good and the behind the scenes drama was a good time for anyone.

I got these DVDs less than a week ago and someone has already borrowed one of the DVDs.  The show is addictive if you have not seen it. It is just a shame that the movie made in season 1 barely made over $100k.  Makes you wonder how Miramax can pony up the $1.5 mil for the season 1 movie and the 1.0 mil for the season two movie (which barely made 240k).  Season 3 is coming soon on Bravo, so I guess that are making profit somewhere.  I suppose DVD sells and the HBO deal made it profitable.

Anyway, definitely think about getting the set slightly used and save a few bucks and enjoy Project Greenlight's best season in my opinion.",1109289600,,1063,4.136585365853659
1735796,5,B00006AFEP,"I must begin by saying that I am addicted to Project Greenlight.  I, too, am an aspiring writer and find PGL inspiring.  I loved this DVD set.
First, Stolen Summer.  It may not win the academy award but it won my heart.  Pete Jones tells a story that is so human and so touching with moments of humor as well as sadness.  It just felt natural and I think that is why I enjoyed it so much.  The little boy who plays the lead role was just amazing, especially being he first time out.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained and touched.
Second, Project Greenlight, the series.  WOW.  I was unable to see all of the episodes while it ran last year so you can imagine my elation to find it all together in a DVD set.  The whole process fascinates me and I just love Jeff Balis ( I love Balis more season 2) and Chris Moore.
Third, Pete Jones.  He was terrific.  Yes, he was rough around the edges but heck he had never done anything remotely like this before.  I think his rapport with the younger actors is a gift and part of what will eventually make him a great director.  The more opportunities Pete is given the better he will hone his craft, I am a fan and wish him all the luck.
Lastly, The Chris Moore Challange was great, Project Redlight was even better.  Project Redlight was terrific in that it poked fun at everyone and the whole process and how wonderful is it that people are able to laugh at themselves in such a ""self involved"" industry!!!
If you are a fan of PGL, buy this, you will love it.",1058659200,2,1535,4.208904109589041
1735797,5,B00006AFEP,"First, the movie.  ""Stolen Summer"" isn't bad, definitely not great, but for a first-time director with no real filmmaking experience at all, it's a pretty good effort.  Sure I'm grading on a curve here, but when you see some of the dreck put out by people with plenty of experience, ""Summer"" begins to seem more than worthy to be called a film.  Throughout the series, many involved express concerns that the script ventured too far down into Afterschool Special territory, and to some extent, they were right.  The nice thing about the script is that it manages to avoid getting too preachy (given the clash of religions at the story's core, that is a feat in itself) and the attitudes of all the characters to young Pete's quest ring surprisingly true, at least, in a nice, better world scenario.  As a directed film, The pacing is a bit slow, scenes can be a bit static, and the child actors in the leads could be a bit stronger, but these are not unusual problems in movies with bigger budgets and more accomplished directors, ""Phantom Menace"", anyone?
Enough defense of Pete Jones, and on to the series.  As a general rule, I steer clear of the ""reality"" genre as it has developed into public humiliation of private citizens while avoiding the need to pay writers (it probably keeps film and video editors in banner business, however).  ""Project Greenlight"" is an exception.  Why?  Well for one thing, the end result is at least a creative endeavor and not just some idiot getting a lot of money or a usless marriage proposal.  For another, you also learn a little something about the business of making a movie, usless of course if you could care less, but it's better than watching ""Survivor"" for wilderness survival tips.",1057017600,2,1729,4.714285714285714

Maybe my low expectations help, because I actually really enjoyed it. It was a bit saccharine at times, and some scenes were definitely a bit rough.

The opening scenes of the Mother getting her large brood off to church in the station wagon perfectly captures the feeling of large families and the affectionate wrangling that goes on between parents and children.
The wariness that often characterizes the relations between Christians and Jews is illustrated in the pained exchanges among the adults as against the easy acceptance between the two boys.
Warning: no sex or violence. Watch at your own risk.",1407542400,,819,5.165413533834586
