Since I am now teaching a film appreciation course, this video adds immeasurably to my arsenal of knowledge to impart to my students! Thanks!!!",1444003200,,252,5.170731707317073

8136186,5,B000H3OAM4,"I was looking all over for this to give as a gift, but it has been listed for over $100, and I just could not pay that much.  I stumbled across it at the PBS shop for $20.00.",1233792000,6,174,3.5789473684210527
8136187,5,B000H3OAM4,"After his epic series of interviews with Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers returns to Skywalker Ranch to interview the property owner. Most of what is thought about Star Wars is based on analysis by fans and professional critics. This program is precious because it is an in-depth look into the pantheon by the actual creator. In ""The Mythology of Star Wars,"" George Lucas talks candidly about his craft and inspirations. A fantastic discussion happens as Lucas talks about his use of color imagery. As with other topics, the discussion relates to psychology and anthropology. Valuable insights are shared when Lucas discusses how he came up with the appearance of Darth Maul. He explains how it was the result of a multicultural search into what people consider to be the physical appearance of evil. Themes like the struggle of good versus evil are discussed in how they relate to the Star Wars universe. Lucas shares personal disclosures when he talks about the disagreements and reconciliation with his father. He also talks about his belief in god and how Star Wars relates to religion. ""The Mythology of Star Wars"" is a deeply philosophical journey into the sources and cultural outcomes of Lucas' films. For such an intellectually demanding topic, Bill Moyers seems perfect. His poignant questions and insights aren't just well-researched and equally intelligent; his interaction is half the fun. The interview is thoughtfully punctuated with just the right snippets from the original trilogy and episode one. This visual element seems to make the interview a complete experience. This piece originally aired around the time that the Phantom Menace was released. Simultaneously, Lucas put together the Magic of Myth road show which can be thought of as a physical extension of this interview.

""The Mythology of Star Wars"" is essential for anyone looking into the deeper elements of the Star Wars universe.

A word about the format. It's wonderful that ""The Mythology of Star Wars"" is actually available in DVD. While I clearly adore this product, I can't imagine anybody paying the outrageous amounts of money being charged by the marketplace sellers. At the time of this review, it was going for a whopping hundred bucks, which is actually fifty bucks less than what it was being offered for a couple of weeks ago. If there was ever a reason to take the VCR out of the attic, this is it. Not that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B000H3OAM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>&nbsp;version isn't also pricey (currently starting at $60.00) but I was able to find mine on e-bay for $10.00.
