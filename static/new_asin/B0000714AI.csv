7973778,5,B0000714AI,"This double feature of super-obscure,  ultra low budget kiddie matinee ""classics"" is a motherlode of unintentional comedy gold for those who love that kind of thing.  Both were written,  directed,  and produced by Barry Mahon,  who was surely the Ed Wood of kiddie films. I'm pretty sure each of the films on this double feature were filmed in the same garage.
If not for the hairstyles and occasional appearance of bellbottom pants,  you'd have no idea these primitive chunks of cinematic madness were made in 1969-70.
It's difficult to say whether these were the work of a Woodsian incompetent or a Lynchian genius.
Either way,  I'm ecstatic that I got my copy back in the day for 10 bucks",1514332800,,691,4.756302521008403
7973779,1,B0000714AI,"I was one of those kids in '69 who endured this horrendous movie.  I think I experienced something akin to PTSD after watching this swill.  I couldn't unsee that eyesore and unfortunately, I'll never forget it.  I mean, really, when a child goes in to see a movie with expectations of something like the original Wizard of Oz I think this borders on child abuse. It gives me the heebee-jeebees just thinking about it. ",1481932800,,418,4.608108108108108

7973782,1,B0000714AI,"I was never sure if I had dreamed or imagined that my grandmother had taken me at 5 years old to a not-the-real-thing Wizard of Oz movie, but for 45 years I've had a vague image in my head of an army of pretty girls armed with knitting needles.  In the throes of insomnia one night I started searching the web, and found out my partially repressed memory, was real!!!!  I couldn't resist and spent some good dollars on this abjectly horrendous movie, just to see the knitting needle soldiers once more!!!!

It was worth every dollar to feel what must have been the same pain my grandmother surely felt having shelled out cash on this piece of dreck back in '68.

Craptastic cinema at its worst.  But at least I know with certainty that I'm not the one who actually invented this miserable excuse for a movie!

7973783,5,B0000714AI,"If Dungeons of Harrow had been a musical, watching that might-- MIGHT prepare you for Wonderful Land of Oz.

SEE the army of teenage 60s hotties in their ""evil drum majorette"" outfits!

SEE the talent-free Channy Mahon yowl his way through this ""musical.""

SEE the plywood nailed together in a configuration that vaguely suggests the outline of the Emerald City! (And every other location.)

See the community theater wicked witch (and Tin Man and Scarecrow and...).

If you love jaw-dropping cinema, if your favorite part of Game of Death was the first few minutes, if your idea of a good time is to repeatedly stammer ""I-- I can't believe they even TRIED to do this!""

You will love Barry Mahon's The Wonderful Land of Oz.

Jack and the Beanstalk is the same drill, made with more effort, and far less ambitious-- and it lacks everything that makes ""Oz"" so hideously riveting.",1319673600,2,878,4.774834437086093
7973784,1,B0000714AI,"Based on the Oz book of the same name, the movie gives the phrase ""turkey"" new meaning.  Its special effects stink, its costumes for the birds, its acting so-so (at best), its songs pathetic.  You get the feeling someone wanted to cut as much costs as possible with no regards to the quality of the movie.  The same holds true for the Jack and the Beanstalk movie - poor acting, poor special effects - and the numerous movies it previews.

There is a silver line behind this dark cloud of a movie, though.  In 1981 a stage production of The Wonderful Land of Oz was televised, entitled The Marvelous Land of Oz, and eventually released on VHS tape.  This was as good as The Wonderful Land of Oz movie is bad and worth a look-see.

Getting back to The Wonderful Land of Oz, maybe someone will drop a house on it or something!",1197763200,,824,4.34640522875817

Hopefully in life i come across some decrepid lunatic who owns this 'Wonder' ahahah.

I HIGHLY recommend the 4disc set of the BEST animated series of Oz, that this site offers. thats what i was looking for whilst i stumbled across this hideous looking artwork of a thing.

LOL, i still cant get over your review, <3",1100563200,3,468,5.025974025974026
