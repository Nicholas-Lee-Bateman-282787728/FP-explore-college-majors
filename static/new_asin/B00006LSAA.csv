In this issue you'll find great skateboarding from The Element Team, Rodrigo Teixeira, Cairo Foster, Rob Gonzalez, Stefan Janoski, Jason Odell, enrique lorenzo, robert lim, and sven kilchenmann. You'll also get great skating in locations around the world such as Australia, Barcelona, Columbia, Mexico and more. This is a great issue. I enjoyed it just as much as I did issue 50.
