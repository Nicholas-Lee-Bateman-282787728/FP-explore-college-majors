222103,5,6300150879,"Definitely a wonderful movie and one of my personal favorites, Eleni, brings to the screen the true story of a boy whose family suffered terribly during the Greek Civil War 1946-49, but who managed, thanks to his mother's love, to get safely to the USA and raise his own family in peace. It is a movie about war, hunger, suffering, but most importantly courage, honor, sacrifice, and how Love-motherly love, can overcome and prevail even in the most difficult of situations. A great movie indeed which will surely bring tears to one's eyes! Needless to say, both Kate Nelligan and John Malkovich are superb in their roles as mother and son!",1218672000,8,640,4.774774774774775
222104,5,6300150879,"This is a fantastic true story about a boy, his mother and his family who are caught up in a communist revolution. If anyone is in doubt about what a choke hold communism can put on a country, see this movie.",1207267200,7,208,4.097560975609756
222105,5,6300150879,"All freedom loving people need to remember how Communists and their twisted ideology destroyed the lives of so many millions of people around the world including this wonderful lady in a village in Greece.

Since this film truthfully depicts the horrors  commited on innocent people  in the name of Communist ideology, Hollywood will take its own sweet time in releasing it in DVD format.",1165536000,10,388,5.03125
222106,5,6300150879,"Having lived in Greece during the period portrayed in the film, I was dumbfounded by the extremely accurate recreation of the period. In addition to their other accomplishments, the creators of this film (producers, set designers, scripwriters, director, actors and others) deserve great praise for authentically reproducing in every single detail the total environment of the Communist insurgency that lasted, with breaks, from December 1944 until the Greek army managed to finally crush the elusive rebels in August 1949. If there was an Oscar for authentic period reproduction, Eleni would win it hands down.",1156636800,17,611,5.51063829787234
222107,5,6300150879,"This true account of a mother's struggle in post-war Greece has haunted me for over twenty years. Since becoming a parent myself, I have often thought of Eleni's sacrifice. It is a great mystery to me why this fantastic film has virtually disappeared from circulation. It's one of the most perfectly realized films you'll come across. The acting, direction, and photography are superb. It's worth owning just for Bruce Smeaton's brilliantly unique musical score. I've tried, without success, to find Greek music in a similar vein.

Much of the opposition to the film in 1985 came from critics who insinuated an anti-Marxist political bias. But they missed the point. The film depicts the story of a mother removed from political machinations that are grinding around her. Eleni wasn't a reactionary, she was a loving mother.  Besides, should ""Shindler's List"" be discredited for having an anti-Nazi political bias?  Of course not.  Great film.",1154736000,13,943,5.184210526315789

222109,5,6300150879,"It is 2:00 a.m. and I cannot sleep after watching this movie.
Mothers love their children but in our decadent, face paced, greed driven society I so often find myself off course, yelling and snappish at the slightest thing. In other words, God forgive me for not conveying that love and for taking our time together for granted.
This movie takes place during the Greek Civil War in the late 1940's. God help us to cease all wars and fighting. 28,000 children were taken from their homes and sent to work in communist camps.
This story shares the sacrifice and love of a brave woman and truly devoted mother, Eleni.",1020470400,11,614,4.590909090909091
222110,5,6300150879,"The mother loved her children enough to die for them.
The son loved his mother enough to kill for her.
In both stories it was children who transformed the situation.
The power of forgiveness bent me in half.
My friend moved from Yugoslavia and her story is so similar to this...a slice of history that reveals that in wartime people trust nobody, and sometimes they learn years later what they should have known at the time, but didn't.  People do the best they can.  This movie has brought tears to the eyes of those I have even told it to - those who have not even seen the movie.
The fact that it is true, makes all the discussion of the acting, the techniques, etc take a back seat to the slicing truth of the story.
Outstanding.

222175,5,6300150879,"When I was young my mother told me of her life as a teenager in post WWII northern Greece. She told me that the communists kidnapped children and I could scarcely believe it. She told me that she was shipped off to an arranged marriage to get her out of harm's way. This movie shows the horror of leaving WWII then immediately falling into a civil war and the difficult choices that my grandparents had to make. We are so lucky and take so much for granted in this country. Great movie, I wish I could find it on DVD.",1473206400,,517,4.18
222176,5,6300150879,"This is a wonderful movie.  I first saw this movie 25 years ago.  It is a powerful and heart wrenching biopic describing the horrors that Eleni, her children and the other people in their village endured still haunts me.

I am so happy that is has finally been released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States.

For those of you who complain about receiving a region 2 copy you should read the detailed specification before purchase.  Amazon provided a warning that prior DVD releases of this film was Region 2 and probably would not work with DVD/Blu-ray players in the U.S.",1472083200,,575,4.598039215686274

222202,2,6300150879,"I hate that I had to give ""Eleni"" three stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the book; so much so that I purchased and read its sequel, ""A Place for Us"".

For fans of the book, you're watching this because you are supporting a Greek/Greek American centric movie (should stick with My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Yes, watch this again if you have to instead of ""Eleni"") and/or you're just simply a big fan of the book.

Harsh words because the author, Nicholas Gage does a brilliant job of recreating the story of Eleni. Mr. Gage is able to piece together comprehensive investigative journalism into a captivating, easy to follow story.

Eleni the movie on the other hand almost presumes you've read the book and attempts to summarize the book in under two hours.

Many parts of the book are skipped. The dialogue makes references to parts that are explained in the book but not at all in the movie. Ultimately, there is a coherency issue.

Unlike many books where the book to movie conversion is acceptable given the time and budget restraints, it would have been much better to have made Eleni a TV mini-series spread across five or six hour long episodes to justly cover Gage's work.

However, the impact is not entirely lost as the actors and actresses are able to portray the emotion that the protagonist and namesake character, Eleni, that the book tries to convey. Short of giving away the ending, Eleni the movie stands as a testament to the author's progress in sharing his mother's story.",1428364800,2,1490,4.689655172413793

It is a scam, to advertise and sell something that is not complete and of poor quality. A full refund is expected as I have shipped the item back. Although a star is required to submit this review, trust me, no stars should be given.",1412553600,12,471,4.186813186813187
222205,1,6300150879,"I received the DVD ELENI today and it could only be played on the computer. It came from Germany and it is not compatible to be played on my wide screen TV ....what a disappointment it is. Should you not only sell products that are compatible with our North American system.

222233,5,6300150879,"Artistic, historically accurate, engaging and extremely moving, Eleni was one of President Reagan's favorites when he was in the White House. His public advocacy of the movie prevented it from disappearing under the cultural censorship that pervaded Hollywood then as now. One wonders why Eleni is not available in Region 1 DVD for people in North America.

222236,5,6300150879,"Absolutely incredible flick. Very powerful performances that gives extra depth and meaning to such a tumultuous time in the modern history of Ellada. This film should be a wake-up call to those of us in America, that the savage thuggery, rape and murder practiced by the Greek Communists, could very well happen here by the Obamunists and their left-wing union, ACORN, Black Panther bases.

It tells of the horrors of the Greek Civil War of the late 1940's and the determination of one woman's fight to save her children.

 I got interested in the protagonist, Nicolas Gage, after reading a very good introduction to the exhibition catalog ""The Greek Miracle. Classical sculpture from the dawn of Democracy. The fifth century B.C."" It is incredible to see what a country like Greece went through in the last 2500 years. Now fighting with economic crisis and difficulty to meet requests from money lenders.
One point mentioned in the catalog about Greek's democracy in 5th century B.C. was the agreement to forgive debt. And instead of revolution killing the reigning aristocrats, to give everyone a heroic lineage to be proud of and start into democracy. Nice way to bring equality and Democracy to life instead of a civil war like last century.
