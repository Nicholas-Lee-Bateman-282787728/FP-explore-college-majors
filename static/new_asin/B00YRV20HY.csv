7231910,4,B00YRV20HY,"Theatrical review. In spite of a few misfires, Melissa McCarthy would seem to be at the head of the class when it comes to comedic actresses.  And where she has clearly successful films (""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat""), director Paul Feig is at the helm.  So it is here.

McCarthy plays Susan Cooper who works for the CIA in a dimly lit basement in Virgina.  She's the eyes and ears for the dashing agents in the field, in this case, a James Bondish-like, Bradley Fine (Jude Law).  While Fine appreciates the work Susan does to keep him alive, he's oblivious to the fact she has a big crush on him.

The agency is trying to retrieve a stolen nuclear weapon which is being offered on the black market to the highest bidder.  One of the middlemen, er...woman is Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) who has gained knowledge of all of the secret agents.  So the director in charge, Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) decides to put Susan in the field to infiltrate the operation.  Evidently Susan was once in training to be a field agent but washed out due to anger issues or something.  In any case, she's surprisingly well versed on spy stuff.

Feig and his crew have created a film big in scope and it certainly has the feel of an authentic Bond film much of the time and not a cheap spoof.  Law would have been a convincing 007.  Things really get fun when Susan abandons the first couple disguises forced upon her by Crocker.  In one scene she says she looks like someone's homophobic aunt.  Jason Statham plays a dim-witted agent who is aghast that he isn't in on the mission.  He's surprisingly hilarious and gets plenty of screen time.  Also, Miranda Hart, a British TV comedian, steals a few scenes as Susan's best friend and fellow desk-jockey.

The scenes with Susan and Rayna are the best, with Byrne again showing that her comedic chops from ""Neighbors"" and the aforementioned ""Bridesmaids"" are no fluke.  Rayna's gigantic bouffant provides some great gags.  When things get dicey for the mission, Susan goes full-throttle with both her physical action and her mouth, which will certainly get a lot of attention.  The movie is rated ""R"" so expect plenty of raunch and flashes of male genitalia.  Very funny.",1438819200,10,2202,4.664935064935065

A spy in the field is killed and the bad guys have come to know the identities of all the other agents. So, it's decided they cannot be deployed. An office employee is given the assignment. You can figure out the rest.

The supporting cast is good and some of the craft elements are above average. But, aside from the lame plot, this principally hangs on the star, Melissa McCarthy. That's too bad because the delivery is right out of a third rate sit-com. There is a market for schlock, but it repels me.",1515974400,,667,4.4227642276422765

What turned us off was dialogue that used an overwhelming amount of expletives to fill up space when scriptwriters apparently couldn't think of anything more witty to say.  Obscenities aren't clever......they're just lazy, dumb and boring.  There's nothing new or refreshing about them unless you're 12 years old.  So I'm taking one star off for every 100 times one obscene word or another was used.  You get the picture.",1515715200,,578,5.161290322580645

It's an action-adventure spy movie that also manages to skewer the spy movie tropes. Melissa McCarthy is a great physical comedian, and Jason Statham does a fantastic job at spoofing every Jason Statham character.

7232074,5,B00YRV20HY,"The hard-hitting comedic punch of Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig is brilliantly show-cased in their latest film, Spy. Once again director and writer Paul Feig creates a masterful backdrop to display McCarthys delightful improvisational talents. A top-billing she deserves and should have earned after her Oscar-nominated role in Bridesmaids.

The fun doesnt end with McCarthy. The supporting cast of Jude Law, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, Allison Janney and Miranda Hart make Spy a well-rounded farce.

Feigs setting for Spy is a tongue in cheek acknowledgement to 007. McCarthy plays CIA desk-jockey, Susan Cooper. A bright, cyber tactician who graduated at the top of her class; unfortunately, her docile demeanor has sabotaged her ability to get any real-world assignments. Even though on the field Cooper happens to be lethal, just ask her last instructor. The video clip of her graduating obstacle test is stomach wrenchingly funny and disturbing.  With the cautionary blessing of her boss, played by Allison Janney, Cooper ventures onto her first mission to thwart the sale of a nuclear bomb.
In her way is Stathams character who tries to sabotage her attempts to get intel and stop the sale. Statham plays a disheartened CIA spy who doesnt believe Cooper is capable of completing her mission. Many times Statham steals the scene with his rantings and ravings as the toughest spy while he follows McCarthy throughout Europe.

Rose Byrne as the arms dealer and femme fatale, Raina Boyanov becomes the bunt of many hilarious improvisational jokes when she meets and befriends McCarthy. Byrnes eccentric hairstyles and McCarthys grim wigs almost take on their own persona in many scenes.  Yet it doesnt stop Bryne or McCarthy from delivering delicious zingers at each other.

Spy has a great cast and script that allows the masterful improv, McCarthy, to shine throughout the film. She gracefully plays the straight man to let her supporting cast sparkle. This role shows her evolving as an actress and developing as a multi-faceted comedian. Spy is definitely another notch in McCarthys comedic black belt.

I love McCarthy as an action hero.  Taking a lifetime of being told ""No you can't"", and proving ""Yes, I can,  And, btw, better than you.""  I had rented it first via RedBox, and decided I needed to own it.",1501804800,,383,4.04

7232088,4,B00YRV20HY,"I think this movie is hilarious. The comedic skills of all the actors are superb. The plot is a hoot, and the camera work delightful. I would have given the film five stars, but for the unnecessary F-bombing. Holy smokes -- F was used in almost every other line (or so it seemed). As fun as this film is, I wouldn't sit down and watch it with the kids ... or grandparents ... or my church group ... or the family dog.  So, since I bought the film, I guess that I will have to watch it in the closet, smother the giggles and hold my ears when appropriate ... or inappropriate.

One more note, for me, the best part of this Cinderella-type spy spoof is that instead of getting the man of her dreams in the end, the heroine gets the career of her dreams. Despite the many other CIA associates who ridicule her and hint that it would be preposterous for her to be a spy, she proves that she's actually the best agent of the bunch.

""Spy"" is really a fun farce with enjoyable characters who all make this film a fun watch ... except for the incredibly course language ... and the rubber penis that just comes across as childish humor.",1500940800,,1129,4.241860465116279

If you're not adult enough to take the scenes of the unrated or director's cut, stick to the children's version or just watch Mary Poppins.  This film incorporates so many things but it has a bit of everything for everyone that's a fan of spoof movies. The line-up of established actors is quite impressive to say the least but is part of the magic formula to help spring this production into action.  If you are a spy-spoof movie fanatic like myself and enjoy an action movie made for adults, this movie is for you.  Enjoy!",1492819200,,584,4.542857142857143
7232131,5,B00YRV20HY,"I usually dislike Melissa McCarthy movies because she ultimately ends up being the obnoxious fat person caricature and whose mere existence is supposed to be the funny part instead of an actually funny script, and this movie looked no different in all the trailers.  However, my friend insisted this movie was different and recommended it to me multiple times before I gave in.  I'm glad I did, because this movie is freaking hilarious.  Melissa McCarthy gets to play an actual person who gets to be serious and sad and funny, and the situations she ends up in are all the more entertaining because of the realism of her character (i.e. throwing up after a fight - I laughed so hard I cried).  She's great in this movie, and I love the fact that her character eventually ended up hitting all of those ""spy character"" cliches - the multiple love interests, the dramatic wardrobe changes, the cool car - without losing any of the humor aspect of the movie.

Jude Law was also funny as the quintessential smarmy Bond-type spy, although his accent slipped a few times, and Rose Byrne was great as well.  The best support character, however, has to be the one played by Jason Statham, who somehow manages to play both with and against his normal action type in the same movie.  This movie blends humor and action perfectly, with one never overwhelming the other, and makes for an extremely entertaining film that makes me laugh no matter how many times I watch it.",1492819200,9,1459,4.67578125

Melissa is an adviser to a field agent in the CIA, watching him on a screen from a CIA office and giving him specific information as to how to stay alive as he tries to bring criminals to justice.  When the field agent, for whom she has a big physical attraction, is killed, she is sent into the field to deter the sale of a nuclear weapon.

The rest of the movie shows her in all sorts of antics, jams, and dangerous situations from which she is constantly doing hilarious things to keep from being killed herself.  For me, this movie is totally entertaining and so funny.",1482969600,2,823,4.2165605095541405

7232333,2,B00YRV20HY,"This James Bond spoof starts off great then quickly goes downhill. . .

-- Very, very predictable. The 2-3 opening scenes with Jude Law you could easily guess what would happen and the interaction between Melissa McCarthy's character and Jude's character throughout was telegraphed and expected throughout. It didn't get much better later on either.

+ Yes, there were some great catchy dialogue sprinkled throughout, but other scenes were left really flat

+ I did find it interesting that on one or two scenes the joke could have been a fat person joke, but they didn't go there. Very interesting.

-- So the transformation from little Ms. Iowa to International Spy for some reason meant going from talking in ""Oh Golly!"" to ""F-this! F-that! F-U! F-F-F!.
Really? WTF was up with that? (joke intended)
It seemed that the writers couldn't make evil characters evil, except through extreme profanity, which doesn't make them evil. And our hero has to go to extreme profanity measures to ""fit in"" with the evil characters. It just got dumb and was one terrible put down after another, which wasn't funny. Horrible dialogue writing!!

+ Melissa McCarthy was great in her delivery of her lines and playing her character. Kudos there and a +star on this review.

My only disappointment is that there are several scenes where the humor is supposed to be the amount of profanity being spewed, and to me that just isn't funny. I don't have an issue with profanity but when it is every other word for two minutes it makes the actor seem juvenile and just isn't funny.",1477008000,,433,4.3580246913580245

 I think it would be just as funny without the bone-shattering violence ... thus the removal of the highest star. I kinda fault all the Quenton Tarantino gruesome violence for pushing producers to infect otherwise-good films with gratuitous violence.

She plays the quiet shy girl who assists an agent in the field, Jude Law and he gets killed and well she takes up the reigns. she infiltrates the bad guys led by Rose Byrne, so funny, and has to stave off the attempts by a rogue agent, Jason Statham, hysterical.

My Star Ratings (with Amazon Ratings in parenthesis):
1 Star (I hate it!) : The lowest score possible. Definitely not worth the money and time and effort! should only use this when the product really does not reflect the product listing. If there are any positives at all to the product or its use, you should not give it 1 star.
2 Stars (I don't like it.): The product is not exactly as described, either appearance-wise or functionally. The product may still be usable but its very different to what was described. The product may have a few faults. I'm not a fan of this item as it is no where close to my expectations and I won't order it again, but I can imagine a few others might find it functional as it has at least one positive quality.
3 Stars (It's okay): This item has both positive and negative qualities. I can definitely see some people loving or liking it as it may work for them, but I would likely not purchase in future. While you might think a 3-star score equates to average, 3 stars counts against the product as a negative score. So if you're not meaning to give it a negative score, rethink your 3-star rating!
4 Stars (I like it): The product is as described and functions well. There may be a few minor issues, but all in all, the product is solid. This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this, but is a good product overall. I would use this item.
5 Stars (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product. product is amazing! You love it! This is the highest of the highs. If you would recommend it to your friends, family  its definitely a 5-star score. Be unbiased here; if the product is exactly as described and meets expectations, but the product isn't your personal favorite, it could still be 5 stars.

I just hate the SJW bulls***. Every male character is vastly incompetent. Which it is funny to see it in Jason Stathem running around like an idiot only because he usually plays the typical action hero however if hes going to play a spy, he might as well be a good one. The story was vapid and tpyical of an action comedy. It wasn't amazingly funny. Paul Feig just sucks and should probably castrate himself already. The message of all his films seem to say I hate myself for being a white man and the worlds social woes are my fault.

7232497,5,B00YRV20HY,"I am not a Melissa McCarty fan, but  made an exception with ""Spy."" I didn't just like this movie--I LOVED it and all because of Melissa. So what's to like:

1. Melissa herself. Normally (I think), with such a large person, ""fat"" jokes would fill the sound waves. Not so in this case. No one made mention of her size and three men try to seduce her,  including two agents sent to look after her.

2. Melissa herself. As a trained undercover agent, her character shows her stuff learned in training camp. But no one sees the training tapes. There are so many funny scenesin the story line itself in which she so ably applies fighting techniques.

3. Melissa's character can solve problems and dilemmas. She takes a problem and makes it into a neatly tied solution--okay, maybe (probably).

4. Jason Statham--he plays such a jerk, but such a lovable jerk. Oh, what a dude! And, oh, what an ending!

5. Jude Law and how that turns out. You see, Melissa's character has been ""in love"" with him for oh, so long.

6. The movie's sheer entertainment value!

If you're unsure about seeing this film, trust me--you're gonna love it!",1470441600,,1122,4.57

This is my first movie review, so please don't be too critical.

This movie had my wife and myself rolling with laughter.  It starts out a little serious for the first 5 minutes.  Then it just gets funny as hell from there.  You do have to have a good sense of humor, and not be born with the beliefs that a married couple should be sleeping in separate beds on television, or you will not like this movie.  You need to have an adult sense of humor.  If you have rated this a one star, then you just need to go back to your 3 Stooges, and Red Skelton.",1468713600,,591,4.0344827586206895

7232663,5,B00YRV20HY,"If you fancy a good giggle then I recommend you get to see the latest offering from director Paul Feig and brilliant comedy star Melissa McCarthy, 'Spy'.
Susan Cooper (McCarthy) is a desk-bound CIA analyst who volunteers to go into the field following the disappearance of a suave super-spy (played by Jude Law) and stop the black market sale of a nuclear bomb.
This is a great spy spoof film and I was relieved to see that McCarthy's character wasn't a female 'Johnny English', she wasn't the bumbling fool who doesn't really fit in, but a field-trained agent who knows exactly what to do and carries out her mission with determination, resourcefulness and the frustration of having to get around cocky, over-confident agent Rick Ford (played superbly by Jason Statham).
There were times during the movie when I felt that the director had given the actors the synopsis of the scene then sat back, watched and probably laughed like the rest of us as they just did what they do best.
Jason Statham played on his 'tough-guy, action hero' persona with a straight-face and such a deadpan manner, that the comedy was much funnier than had he tried the slapstick approach.
The rest of the cast were terrific and it was, all in all a good movie with some good action pieces and some great comedy.

I feel sorry for any guy dragged to this putrid mess.  Mellisa Mcarthy just kind of breezes through it, showing very little emotion.  I've lost count at the amount of f Bombs dropped in the first 30 minutes.  Paul Fig Newton wrote this one...is this how he thinks people talk in R rated comedies? the Dialouge is that of a 4th grader learning to swear for the first time.  Not one of the characters is likeable or believable.  All of the guys are absolute morons...until one does a complete 180 at the end (maybe someone at the studio thought it came off as male bashing, and they'd be right).  One of the lead female characters actually says 'I just shot a man, and it felt really good. it's so ME!'  that's a little disturbing peak into paul feigs psyche if you ask me...along with all of the men violently killed in this movie. I won't bring up the lady who pulled a knife out of her own hand and continued to fight like a super woman as if nothing happened.  If this is what we've got to expect with feigbusters, then RIP Ghostbusters.  it was a fun ride until this moron got a hold of it.  you need help feig.  you are clearly stuck at 10 years old when you got bullied by men and havn't gone past that thought point.  seek counseling.  and stop turning ghostbusters into a hate campaign against men, OK?",1463011200,,1445,4.303703703703704

7232774,4,B00YRV20HY,"As a comedy, ""Spy"" is moderately funny.
As satire, poking fun at every conceivable Hollywood cliche, it is brilliant.
Jude Law's character, for example, is a cartoonish version of James Bond while Jason Statham is over the top as a character straight out of the action films he normally stars in. Law is suave, confident, and dashing: Statham is loud, vulgar, and incompetent. Melissa McCarthy, meanwhile, plays the part of the desk-bound assistant suddenly thrust into the role of agent with verve.
The satire starts with the title sequence, which is reminiscent of all the Bond films and many of that franchise's imitators, and it never stops.
You want car chases? ""Spy"" has them, including one in which the bad guys drive the wrong way down a busy highway. It was a great idea when it was featured in ""Ronin"" some years ago but it has since become an almost obligatory part of every spy/action movie. Writer-director Paul Feig sticks a fork in it by having McCarthy chase the bad guys on an under-powered scooter. It's ridiculous, of course, and points out just how hackneyed this car-chase sequence has become.
Shootouts? Oh yes, plenty of them featuring - of course - bad guys armed with automatic weapons who can't seem to hit anyone even by accident.
Unrealistic fight scenes? McCarthy and Law are featured in several in which they tackle bunches of bad guys and dispatch them with relative ease.
Double agents?
Double crosses?
Evil villains?
Cool gadgets?
""Spy"" has more than its share of them as well.
Judging from some of the reviews I've read, many people were disappointed in this movie because it isn't ""realistic.""
Sorry, but that's the whole point.",1462752000,2,1663,4.879858657243816

Strathan comes across as a bozo, and the girl who is the lead actress----let's just say I was glad when the movie was finally over.

7232838,3,B00YRV20HY,"CIA employee is secretly in love with her coworker who works in the field. He gets killed and she signs up to go in the field to track down his murder.

This is another comedic take on the people next door who stumble into crazy circumstances and have to live out a super-hero-like life. It is funny as Melissa McCarthy can be funny at times. Sometimes I think she is just stupid and not very funny. It seems her talent (or how it makes it to the end users like us viewers) gets perverted. I don't know if that is her or what. But she seems harmless and funny for general audiences one minute but then goes on some drug/alcoholic/sexually perverted rant the next. Anyway, the movie was over all funny. But there were some dud moments for sure. I found Jason Statam's ability to make fun of himself and other action heroes in this movie refreshing. The movie was pretty violent in certain scenes. . . graphically violent.

And as I have said several times . . . because ""movie stars"" like for us to talk about them I will comment on Jude Law's face. Is he just getting old? Dunno. But something was wrong with it? It seemed like it had been stretched long-wise. Huge forehead. Huge mouth and lips. The distance from his nose to his top lip seemed like the size of a football field. Huge nose. Huge chin. Is that how he has always looked? Seems kinda plastic like and stretched out. Weird.

As a bonus to get to finally see that the androgynous character in that AbFab skit with Nathan Lane was actually a woman--the friend of the Melissa McCarthy character. I never knew. Couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman. I speaking of the ""Japanese"" she/he/it character that Patsy gives a once up and down when they visit Nathan Lane's character's shop. Funny. Knew instantly it was her as I have never took the time to look it up. Where has she been all these years?",1461110400,,1859,4.367052023121388

7232860,5,B00YRV20HY,"I was pretty much off the Melissa McCarthy bandwagon when Spy came out, and, damn, if the movie didn't make me jump back on the bandwagon. Spy is an action comedy that services both genres in equal dosage, and credit that to Paul Feig, mastermind behind Bridesmaids and The Heat. Spy has so much going for it. But at its heart is McCarthy who smartly tones down her schtick and, so, is able to deliver a more three-dimensional character. She plays Susan Cooper, a desk-bound CIA analyst who volunteers for undercover work when the CIA's top field agents are compromised. The McGuffin happens to be a small-scale tactical nuke what's been put up on the black market, and that's the last I'll say about that. So there's Susan Cooper doing field work, tasked with a track and report only assignment. She's sternly cautioned not to engage the target. Of course, she engages the target.

There's a whiff of Shaun of the Dead in that Spy opens as a clever lampoon of the espionage flick but then metamorphoses into an actual (and surprisingly riveting) espionage flick. Shaun of the Dead famously did the same for zombie horror. There's also a whiff of Get Smart (the film version) in that it manages to balance the spoof elements with storytelling that sucks you in because it had some gravitas to it. McCarthy's Susan initially comes off as insecure and timorous and she demonstrates this mousy Midwestern sensibility, so the supposition is that, oh, great, we'll be getting this maladroit spy who bumbles her way out of scrapes. But then comes that one scene - Susan training at the shooting gallery - that throws a monkey wrench in that assumption. That one scene goes a long way into mitigating our incredulity at Susan's adroitness at field ops. McCarthy makes it work, somehow. You empathize with her. You come to buy into her badassery.

This movie has so many secret weapons. The supporting cast is top drawer, with Jason Statham, Alison Janney, and Rose Byrne the clear stand-outs, with Jude Law not too far behind (he plays the Jack Bauer to McCarthy's Chloe, only he's more debonair than Jack). Statham plays a rogue operative who's a legend in his own mind - and, oh my days, the man's epic monologuing! So funny. It's very cool to see him make fun of his screen image. Alison Janney has a minor part but she draws out laughs as the mean, deadpanned CIA boss. And Rose Byrne? Rose Byrne is the effin' truth! She's done enough roles now in which she's dead-on with her comic timing. She's briliant in her scenes with McCarthy - and these scenes, in my opinion, are the movie's best comic scenes. The stuff they say to each other are so appalling yet so gut-bustingly funny. It's insult humor that wouldn't be out of place in a raunchy roast.

You will laugh your nuts off. The hard R rating allows the script to strafe your ears with f-bombs. Those Byrne-McCarthy moments wouldn't be as effective without that R rating. But the rating also applies to the violence which borders on graphic. Paul Feig has made known his wanting to direct a James Bond movie, and Spy can pass as his audition. He takes the action sequences seriously. He does a JOB in convincing us that McCarthy makes for a credible action heroine. She terminates bad dudes with brutal efficiency, never mind that her cover identities comprise of a mother of four from Iowa and a cat lady who sells Mary Kay products. That's another thing that had me laughing but also sympathizing with her. She seems truly crestfallen each time she's given an unflattering cover identity, not to mention the cool spy gadgets she's armed with aren't nearly so cool (stool softener and anti-fungal spray? Ha ha ha!).

See Spy, I think you'll like it. Shockingly, it stacks up there with the best spy action thriller while still being hysterically funny. McCarthy has hit on that formula that lets her be immensely likable and vulnerable but also lets her do her thing, and her thing is loud and crass and vulgar. Rose Byrne is magnificent. And Jason Statham? You go on believing there's a face-off machine.

4.5 out of 5 stars for this one. I would've rated it 5 stars, but I had to sit thru Tammy, and I'm still bitter.",1460937600,,4174,4.658073270013569

7232885,4,B00YRV20HY,"This skewering of the 007 spy genre serves up quite a few laughs.  Ive never bothered to watch a McCarthy movie and shes not what attracted me to this movie.  That was Jason (The Transporter) Statham who has fun chewing up the scenery as the tough-as-nails but dumb-as-a-brick agent who Melissa McCarthys character special agent Susan Cooper helps out of many a bumbling jam.  McCarthy has a knack for conveying an unassuming character who is capable of far more than what everyone expects, including herself, and she supplies almost bashful mannerisms while doing so.  Its easy to like her and root for her, and to even buy the sham of her conniving as an undercover agent.  There are many, many funny moments throughout such as when she gets a gift from superagent Bradley Fine (Jude Law, sporting a horrendous hairpiece!) whom she has supported by feeding him vital info from within his earpiece as he dashes along in the field; at a posh restaurant when she gets a surprise gift from him and hopes that its a proposal ring (shes got a smidge of crush) she opens the box to find a horrendous button that she begrudgingly wears with all of the squirmy intensity of balanced pose against reactive repulsion.  Statham and Law hit their comedic marks and the film is aided by other fun performances from a variety of actors including poodle-haired Rose Byrne playing the films main villain Rayna who seems to never have met a cuss word she didn't like, and Miranda Hart who plays McCarthys best bud in a delightfully daft and awkward way.  The comedy comes straight from the actors timing and a funny script that allows tilted situations to play out almost naturally, but still tilted.

Many of the bonus features are worth a gander and are funny on their own.  Watching the cast try to keep their composure as they say some of the most ridiculous things to each other is LOL contagious.  Kudos to a well put together and actually funny spy spoof that doesnt have to stoop to Austin Powers stupidity and gags to gain its laughs.  4.5 stars.",1459900800,4,2039,4.667597765363128

7232928,5,B00YRV20HY,"Solidly funny movie. Melissa McCarthy is always funny but the supporting cast is incredible. Rose Byrne's character delivers some insults that you have to hear twice before you really get how funny they are. There are a couple of unnecessarily raunchy scenes that stand out as gratuitous, but they don't detract too much from the general hilarity of the movie. Susan (McCarthy) is a desk-job spy, supporting Bradley Fine (Jude Law), a field agent who gets shot by Rayna (Rose Byrne) early in the movie. With her co-desk agent's help (the incredible Miranda Hart) and the begrudging support of her boss (always-incredible Allison Janney), Susan sets off into the field to right some wrongs while trying to dodge the misguided rogue agent Ford (Jason Statham, in a one-note performance). The characters play well off each other and the McCarthy-Byrne pairing is a stroke of genius.",1458950400,,879,5.068965517241379

7232980,5,B00YRV20HY,"Usually not a large fan of Melissa McCarthy movies typically because she plays someone who is not competent and the jokes are at her personal expense.  But this was the first time MM played someone relatively normal. At the start of the movie you do think that the jokes will be all about her weight but as we go on, that joke fades and it stops being the joke. I get the feeling that his movie could have actually had any actress in the main role and it is only because MM is the lead that it is considered a comedy.

That said, as others have said MM plays a behind the scenes handler (susan cooper) to super Spy and adorable good guy, Bradley Fine. Bradley is a nice guy but is no fool and encourages MM to stay as his helper and not be an agent. Right from the start we see her character being awesome and competent getting Fine out of jams. Obviously she cares deeply about Fine. When Fine gets killed, however, mousy Susan decides to go in as an agent. A double agent has leaked the identities of all the top agents and they need someone who isn't known. Susan is just supposed to track and report, but of course, she gets quite involved.

This movie imho also has some amazing action scenes. Better than several actual spy films (looking at you Borne Legacy) and high production value with good spy songs and a fun soundtrack.  For me there were a few laugh out loud moments but mostly I enjoyed seeing the Susan cooper character be pretty awesome in a way that was somewhat believable.",1457740800,,1493,4.340501792114695

Melissa McCarthy plays a character very similar to the one in 'The Heat' - certainly it's not a departure from her usual roles, but she does it well.  In this film, she's an intelligence agent who is sent from her usual desk job to becoming a field agent tracking down a nuclear weapon, and along the way encounters Rose Byrne as an impeccably dressed villain and Jason Statham as a colleague 'gone rogue' to help.  While some of the cat-lady jokes grew stale, there was still a lot of fun and action in this film to make it work.

7233004,5,B00YRV20HY,"I NEVER would have thought Spy was worthy of 5 stars based on the extremely tedious James Bond spoof in the first 10 minutes.  I even grabbed the TV remote and almost flipped it to another station and another movie because this segment was *that* horrendous, however something told me to stick with it.  Actually the lasagna I was eating was extremely good so I didn't feel like looking for something else to watch while eating a hot delicious homemade meal (and on another note, my lasagna cooking skills have improved *dramatically* in the 3 years since I started cooking it!  All this time I just had to add more sauce so it wouldn't turn rock hard!)

Melissa McCarthy's character is extremely funny!  With this and Tammy, I'd like to know what else she plays in with this outrageous style of comedy.  She seems to be kind of like a female version of Jim Carrey.  At least in my opinion.  Basically the part I hate in the first 10 minutes is when Melissa uses her computer skills to help guide Jude Law's character around so he can take out the bad guys in typical boring James Bond fashion, however it turns out he eventually gets killed/shot after a plan goes wrong and he gets caught, leaving Melissa McCarthy as the one who has to take on the mission and eliminate the enemies herself.  And since she's nowhere *near* cut out for the job, you guessed it!  She goes through with it anyway despite how reckless and silly she is!  She travels from France to Italy and says many hilarious lines while the outrageousness never ceases.

From here Miranda Hart takes over the computer duties that Melissa used to be in charge of, and as soon as Melissa meets up with Rose Byrne (a snotty rich princess type lady who thinks she's the most precious person on the planet) this is when the storyline turns downright awesome.  This is because Melissa and Rose are *nothing* alike.  It's also when the vulgarity goes up several notches as well.  Expect *several* moments of inappropriate language between Rose and Melissa with F words flying out of the barn since the two women don't get along at all!  Turns out Melissa has some fighting and shooting skills of her own (or perhaps she's just always lucky by being in the right place, heh) that enables her to win dangerous encounters.  She can also land airplanes and drop helicopters!  Jason Statham is another memorable character, as is the French guy who persistently flatters and even feels Melissa's body even though she hates it and constantly brushes it off, lol.

I guess this movie's purpose is to make fun of James Bond.  Personally I don't like James Bond movies and never put in a serious effort to watch one, so a mockery of all the spying, shooting and sneaking around that has made James Bond so famous in the eyes of many is mocked in consistent hilarious fashion throughout Spy.  Just be wary of the first 10 minutes.  After that a big improvement is on the way.  Highly recommended!  Watch Tammy too!",1457136000,,2963,4.6

Action sequences were poorly thought out.  Lots of very low grade humor mixed in (as well as very not safe for kids humor!).  My biggest complaint though is the pacing.  Seems like 80% of the time we're just waiting for something interesting to happen as we sludge through dialogue or her character's self-depreciation.

She was wonderful in Bridesmaids, but her talent seems to get lost a lot in other movies.  This was one that I didn't get bored with and I thoroughly enjoyed her in this movie from start to finish.

I was reminded of the versatility of Rose Byrne.  The first movie I saw her in was 'I Capture the Castle' and I loved her immediately.  She can do almost anything.  Though it is hard to watch her shrink into a pile of bones, she can go from dramatic/serious to funny and back again without blinking an eye.",1454716800,,657,4.380165289256198

7233473,5,B00YRV20HY,"Melissa McCarthy is an actress who has shown that she can be way off target with some of her films and then rebound to have a direct hit with the next. Its nice to know shes willing to take chances but at the same time she needs to have someone there to tell her when things don't work. If she can do that more often then the odds of her successes will multiply. Consider the fact that she came off the well-made THE HEAT only to come up with TAMMY which was difficult to watch. The good news is that the second film after that one is this weeks top pick, SPY. It is one of the funniest movies Ive seen all year.

McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, the CIA analyst who makes the top notch spy she works with, Bradley Fine (Jude Law), look good. Through his earpiece and via button camera she helps warn him when someone is behind him, the number of bad guys headed his way and where they're coming from and steps in via drone when the chips are down. While all of this comes from her computer he gets the credit for being in the field. Without her hed probably not be the success he is.

But Susan has a secret. Shes fallen for the man shes supposed to protect. So maybe when shes doing her job she has a personal interest in him coming back alive as well. When he rewards her by taking her to dinner after a successful mission his reward for her work is less than she expected.

That all changes when Fine, on a job to locate Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne), is killed by her after a jamming device prevents Susan from helping him. As Rayna tells Susan via Fines camera, she knows the names and identities of the Agencys top spies. Sending any of them out to locate her would be to condemn them to certain death.

Agency head Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) is looking for options. With a portable nuke about to be auctioned off shes open to ideas. Headstrong and cocky spy Rick Ford (Jason Statham) insists he go in and when she refuses he leaves the Agency and goes rogue. As a suggestion Susan suggest that she go in. No one know her and shes the best informed about the case. A surprising review of her early tests scores and footage leaves Crocker with the idea of trying her out and Susan is sent into the field to follow leads and return information only. Of course we are well aware that more than that is bound to happen.

And it does in some hilarious moments. McCarthy is adept at both a quick turn of a phrase as well as the physical aspects of comedy that follows in the footsteps of some of the greats such as Lucille Ball. She never holds back and in the end it pays off. A running joke of Susan wanting to look the part of a glamorous spy and being forced into disguises that make her more cat lady than cat woman works each and every time its used here. But can she accomplish the task at hand? Can she locate the nuke before a terrorists gets his hands on it? Only time will tell and that time is well spent watching and laughing out loud at this side splitting film.

Not only does McCarthy turn in a great performance, fans of Miranda Hart will find themselves cheering for her here in the role of sidekick to Susan in the role Susan performed for Fine. Hart is a much loved comedienne in England but not as well known in the states. Hopefully that will be remedied after this film. Jude Law does a great job here as well showing a Bond like character that isn't quite as much as he thinks he is. And Statham shows that he has a comedic side rarely made visible in most of his films. His madman like over the top spy who appears at the worst moments is always laugh inducing.

While watching this film I found myself laughing more often than not. The true test though was found in my wife whose sense of humor exists but not often to the point that she laughs loudly at most comedies. With this film she was doing just that, a sure sign that the movie worked not just for me but should be one that any and all comedy lovers will enjoy. I doubt there will ever be a cross over between the long running James Bond films and Susan Cooper but it would be hilarious to see it happen. Instead lets just hope that a follow up is in the works and that time is taken to make sure it fires on all cylinders like this one does.",1453334400,5,4226,4.190651906519065
7233474,3,B00YRV20HY,"Typical same old Melissa McCarthy, chubby girl with an attitude spiel, although this one didn't play that quite so hard.  Mildly entertaining.  Spy actually had a plot--rather than just multiple SNL skits threaded together like most of her movies.  I think she may actually be a decent actress, too bad they just keep trying to use the same old--""Overweight Chick in Absurd Situation"" formula--it got old VERY quickly, and doesn't do her justice.",1453334400,2,446,5.082191780821918

The language in this move is really bad, so I wouldn't have it playing near little kids or people who are offended by foul language.  And there is a scene that shows the male anatomy very clearly and it leaves nothing to the imagination.  But the story is entertaining, the jokes are funny (and they aren't all at the expense of Melissa) and Jason Statham is so ridiculous as a 'real spy' that it is one of the highlights of the film for me.  I rented it on dvd but then purchased it on blu ray.... as far as the film goes you do get some longer scenes on the blu ray version, but in my opinion only a couple actually add to the story at all.  And when we first in the blu ray it appeared to have a glitch that made it skip just a tiny bit.  But after we took out the disc a couple times it starting working correctly.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends...just not the ones that have issues with bad language and nudity.",1453334400,,1037,4.049019607843137

7233525,4,B00YRV20HY,"After watching the trailer for this film, I was absolutely uninterested.  It looked like yet another generic ""Johnny English"" ripoff about someone who shouldn't be a spy suddenly forced on the job.  But after so many positive reviews, I decided to check out the film, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually is a very funny film and it doesn't rely on the tired cliches of the genre.

Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, who works in a British Intelligence agency.  Instead of being in the field, her role is to serve as the eyes and ears of people who are, giving them information and providing them with help to allow them to finish their missions unscathed.  She's usually asigned to work with Bradley Fine (Jude Law), who's her secret crush and once he's killed by an enemy who seems to know the identities of all the agency's field agents, she's forced to take the job in order to retrieve a nuclear device and avenge Bradley's death.

The first thing to notice is that the movie avoids the classic ""bumbling idiot lucks into success"" plot.  Susan is clearly an effective, smart and well trained agent, she simply stays on the computers because that's what she prefers.  Every time things go right for her it's due to her prowess rather than chance.  The same goes for the villain played by Rose Byrne, who doesn't just easily buy the agent's cover and is reasonably suspicious when it's warranted.  Also, importantly, this movie doesn't rely on silly slapstick and fat jokes for its humor.

The real stand-out of the film, though, is Jason Statham.  He plays a character that's basically a mockery of the usual one-man army guy he plays, someone who only believes himself to be as effective as those men usually are.  It's a really entertaining character, who never loses faith in his awesomeness despite reality constantly showing him he absolutely should.  Statham is clearly having the time of his life playing the character.

If I have a complaint about this film is that most of the other characters are a bit too generic.  Melissa McCarthy is known for playing only two roles: the cutesy, innocent introvert and the foul-mouthed, masculine brawler, and in this movie she plays both.  Her best friend is exactly the kind of character who you expect the protagonist's best friend to be like in a movie like this one.  And the other villains are quite more than a bit predictable.

Those complaints are small, though, and the movie is still a blast.  I definitely recommend it.",1452988800,6,2492,4.7622377622377625
7233526,5,B00YRV20HY,Watched it with friends and even with all the bad language (which Melissa McCarthy always has) it was a very funny movie...If you can get past the language it is a fun time and everyone in our group liked it....,1452988800,,211,4.3

there were too many named actors and only one was barely tolerable due to her looks (and this was not the lead star of the movie)

I'm not a prude but when you hear an actor use F*** for every other word then you have to know the movie is in trouble

The only PRO that I can say about the movie is that Rose Bryne looked very good but unfortunalely most of her dialogue also had more F*** words than what is necessary",1451260800,,696,4.2180451127819545

Melissa McCarthy did her best to pull it off, but for most of the movie, poor writing and plotting couldn't be overcome.

I believe that she was miscast for this movie. Her humor is great in a sitcom, but not for the length of a feature film.

As great as the musical score, directing and editing was, this movie couldn't deliver laugh-out-loud humor.",1451174400,2,669,4.7094017094017095

Susan Cooper is a deskbound CIA analyst, and the unsung hero behind the Agency's most dangerous missions. But when her partner falls off the grid and another top agent is compromised, she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent a global crisis.

This genuinely is one of the best comedy movies of the year, the story is great, so many opportunities to drop great jokes and one-liners, the spy movie has been done in so many ways yet it seems to keep re-inventing especially after the awesome Kingsman secret service movie earlier this year, Spy has its own unique blend too, a very well written dark comedy edge, it keeps spitting the gags and one-liners at you constantly, all very funny belly laughs, the gags are pulled off well from the great cast, Melissa McCarthy is a very hit and miss actress, she's not everyone's cup of tea but in this she shines, she can really spit out the funny dialogue, Rose Byrne also a very fine sexy actress who shines when doing comedy, she plays a perfect sexy villain, Jude Law plays a cool character and Jason Statham plays a very funny bumbling agent, he's the hard man still but takes on the comedy quite well, there is some unusual casting too from Miranda Hart but she is very fun to watch, this is an overall great comedy that needs to be seen, a very entertaining secret agent movie with all the gadgets, guns, girls, fights, shoot-outs and certainly some bloody violence too which is not too expected to pop up in a comedy, its packed front to back with hilarity, this is one comedy that deserves a sequel.

First off, this is supposed to be a comedy - but it's not remotely funny, unless your sense of humor got stuck somewhere around the age of 15. The words ""stupid"", ""offensive"" and ""tacky"" would help to offer a quick review. The language stands out. ""F"" bombs are no big deal, since this is the kind of stuff we all hear (and say) every day. But expanding that into its verbal usage on a regular basis just gets embarrassing after a while. The plot itself has been done over and over. It's a send-up of the Bond genre. It's also been done light years better many, many times. I really wanted to like this movie, and looked forward to watching it. It turned out for me, my wife and my adult visiting son, to be beyond disappointing. It is easily one of the five worst movies I have ever sat through. We watch a lot of movies and are huge movie fans. This one?

Overall this is a great spoof of the spy movies and has some great sight gags, not to mention some beautiful scenery from around the globe.

She also has that rare ability to elevate films that otherwise shouldn't really have been made, like Tammy and Identity Thief. This particular film happens to marry a good concept with a great performer, and the results are excellent. Nothing she has done has topped her brilliant performance in The Heat, but Spy is a must see if you liked McCarthy in her other films. As the star, she is also well served by a great supporting cast who relentlessly hurl derogatory remarks at her, which she only absorbers with good humor. Rose Byrne is particularly effective.",1450915200,,649,5.018518518518518

Extremely well-written and directed, and what I love is Melissa McCarthy's true transformation (not just physically) from the beginning of the film to the end.  Her chemistry with Rose Byrne is out of control funny, and hoping that Rose Byrne gets her own breakout lead role very soon.  I'm also a huge fan of all the music from the film.

Whether you're a Melissa McCarthy fan or not, this is not her typical slapstick comedy.  There's actually an important message hidden deep down within all the hilarity and action....an underrated gem!!",1450483200,,640,4.678571428571429

7233738,1,B00YRV20HY,"This movie suffered from a lot of different ailments.  Most of all, as seems to be the going rate with Melissa McCarthy movies as of late, this film just doesn't quite know what it wants to be.

McCarthy's ad-libbing schtick gets old very quickly, as in all of her performances (it seems), and can become quite painful to watch.  Although she is surrounded by capable, if not miscast actors throughout the film, the dialogue still seems to awkwardly struggle along.

Jason Statham's turn at comedy feels unsuccessful, and falls flat, and the film's attempts at comedy never truly find their pace.

Although there are a few (literally, only a few) funny moments to be had, this film really misses the mark......especially at a 2-hour run time.  There was no reason for this film to have extended to that length.  At least 30 minutes easily could have, and probably should have, been cut from this film.

I know that McCarthy and her collaborators try to play against her weight struggle for laughs, but in all honesty, she really comes off as a ""sad clown"" act, more than anything else....which is a shame, because I think that she is a much more attractive woman and better actor than that.",1450396800,,1190,4.714975845410628

She is so funny on her TV show and I had hoped from watching the trailers that this would be a funny movie but this movie is just bad.

While I expected this, I had also hoped it might not go this way. It seems to be the trend of comedies these days. If you watch this on TV censored it will probably be one of the funniest movies you've seen in a long time. If you watch it otherwise, it will really depend on your comedy tastes. I'm the kind of person who finds bleeped out profanity funnier than actually hearing it. If your not that kind of person, you will likely enjoy this more than I did. I had some laughs but as it got more extreme it became less funny. The sad thing is, there IS a really funny movie in here, its just collapsing under its own efforts to be profane. This movie could have been an easy five-stars, could be... For those who enjoy the constant explicit language and brief but gut-wrenching scenes of male 'nudity' it has to offer, it will likely be the funniest movie of the year.",1449446400,2,999,4.291005291005291

After hearing the f-word multiple times in the same sentence, and seeing so many people give the middle finger to each other, you wonder what writer/director Paul Feig was trying for. The raw language was somewhat funny coming from Jason Statham's mouth because it was part of his working-class British character. But it was sad to see Melissa McCarthy and some of the other cast sink to that level. There are also a couple of quick still shots of erect male members, in case you have a problem with that (not sure what they were trying for there, either). Yet another example of a Hollywood film the could have been so much better if they had not sunk into the gutter for so much of the humor.

7234050,1,B00YRV20HY,Not sure....could never finish the movie due to the amazon app on my tv continually freezing and either shutting down the app and even shutting down the entire tv.  I don't have these regular issues with netflix.  And when i called customer service i got routed to africa where they were hard to understand and couldn't fix it.  Then the guy tried to sell me some gadget called fire....i don't want to buy something else to fix something i paid for that didn't work in the first place!  Amazon is great for shopping but leaves a lot to be desired on the digital front!,1448668800,,568,4.4326923076923075
7234051,5,B00YRV20HY,"Ok this movie is HILARIOUS. Raunchy and the language is a little on the rough side (lots of F bombs, you've been warned) but if you love Melissa McCarthy and don't mind silly humor and crude language, this is a great movie to rent. I found myself laughing through this entire movie. Wonderful cast and great plot with tons of humor. I watched this with my husband and we both equally loved this movie. My parents....(my mom is a little more conservative) they even liked it! It's a must watch for Melissa M. fans. Enjoy!!",1448668800,,521,4.494736842105263

7234054,5,B00YRV20HY,"Most of the Melissa McCarthy movies after Bridesmaids have been rather disappointing. I did not even crack a smile watching Tammy so I had given up hope.  I cannot tell you how happy I was when I first roared with laughter watching Spy.  Even better, the laughs just kept coming.  I think the reason this movie worked so well was the casting.  My favorite pairing was McCarthy with Miranda Hart.  They were hysterical together.  I did not even look to see who the director was until the credits rolled.  Once I saw it was Paul Feig, it all made sense.  With the exception of one his comedies, I have enjoyed everything he has done.

For me, this movie just clicked.  It kept me laughing and that is what I expect from a comedy.",1448668800,2,727,4.398496240601504

Negatives are 1) too many moving parts, 2) the British sidekick with a voice that is just too difficult to understand, and 3) too much unnecessary R-rated language just for the sake of having R language.

Well worth the rental fee & will be on our list for buying since it will definitely have re-watchability. I would say, though, to mind the unrated rating because there are some VERY adult moments. I'm laughing just thinking about some of them! ;) It's a little campy, a little twisted, a little nutty - just fun all around if you have a sense of humor with even just a bit of an edge. & if you're a little dark - like we are - you can still really enjoy it. There are so many one-liners and moments that I can't wait to rewatch.

Mellissa McCarthy is the most un-spy person I could ever imagine but that is why this farce on Bond movies is so hilarious.  For me, it was laugh out loud hilarious!  I am a fan of Jason Statham and he is so serious in all of his movies, I was hoping to see a different side of him in this movie.  He really was pretty silly, still trying to be the macho man but in an over the top way.  I got my wish though.  If you go through the credits, there is an out-take at the end that is Melissa with him in bed under the covers.  She says something funny and he rolls over cracking up with the biggest prettiest smile.  I know everyone had fun making this movie, I could just feel it!  This is just pure entertainment!

After giving ""The Heat"" a chance and being disappointed with the lack of intelligence in the dialog - ""Oh yeah. Well, f@*k you!"" and hilarity ensues - I should not have even bothered renting this. Crude language does not make a situation funnier or more dramatic. Melissa McCarthy delivered some lines well but usually I felt uncomfortable watching her character's awkward social interactions. I know she was an analyst and not a field agent but I hold the writer/director responsible for making her character someone who is not sympathetic. (And if her support agent Aldo had died 30 seconds after his introduction I would have cheered. Not a fan.)

Jude Law played the debonair Bond-type beautifully.  But Jason Statham stole scenes ranting about how epic his own heroic feats have been and then collapsing at crunch time.  Despite this being a spoof, the movie had a lot of heart.  I loved the ending where (SPOILER ALERT) McCarthy chooses to celebrate with her tall girlfriend (Miranda Hart) instead of Law's guy spy.

This was actually a big budget movie.  There were incredible fight scenes, car chases, explosions and more. Everything you'd expect from a James Bond film, but all the while was a hilarious comedy.  It was one of the most action-packed action/comedy movies I've ever seen. I saw a lot of people give it one star ratings, criticizing that there was too much profanity. To that I say, it is an R rated movie, and the vulgarity made the characters and the dialogue even funnier.

The only bad thing about this movie was that the trailers and TV spots only showed a few funny parts. This movie is WAY better than the ads made it seem. Had they marketed it better, it could've done even better at the theaters. I hope they make a sequel.",1447372800,,860,4.35625

Rose Byne is the perfect villianess, and if you can deal with the totally inane FUs that are thrown about throughout this, you'll not notice them at all after a while.

Honestly, the language problem was distracting at best, and at worst a miscalculation of the audience.  Additionally, the main character, played by Melissa McCarthy, gets angry and violent rather than staying a sweet and out-of-place desk agent.  Both of these writing problems (blame it on the script) contribute to a dramatic lessening of what is an otherwise finely crafted work, including great performances by all the notable actors.  Had they had better writing, it would have been among the best movies of the year.  One almost gets the sense that it is an adolescent at work, or at the very least, written by somebody who is not a parent.  Oh well, not a particularly memorable film, but one you can't blame on the acting or directing - the faults lie entirely in the script.",1447286400,,924,4.74375

there is a dangerous trade about to take place, the sale of a nuclear-device, they need someone under-cover
that isn't known to the arms-dealers......agent 'Rick Ford' (Jason Statham) believes he should be the one to
deal with the situation despite being a known agent, however an unlikely volunteer offers her services, her job,
....a desktop analyst, 'Susan Cooper' (Melissa McCarthy)
'Susan' imagines that she'll be given a heap of Special-Agent gadgets, she'll be disappointed in that department,
however she bundles and talks her way through the early encounters but quickly grows in confidence and soon
puts into practice that which she had learnt when privately acting-out an agents skills of combat.
There are many very funny action sequences  as 'Susan' seemingly often takes control of situations by accident...
Well supported by fellow analyst 'Nancy' (Miranda Hart) and 'Rose Byrne' as arms dealer 'Rayna Boyanov'
There is frequent use of the f-word and there is a sequence when a 'penis' is on full view (not sure it was necessary
to be honest)
'Melissa McCarthy' has had funnier roles........however, she's a class-act, the film is worthy of a viewing.

I absolutely love the cast; love their previous movies (most); and the previews had me rolling. the movie itself was rather disappointing. This is a great example of a great idea NOT well executed. The acting was largely fine, but the story felt disjointed and forced. I'm trying to recall movies that did the action/dramedy genre justice. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one. It's a stretch to put it in the same genre, but maybe even Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? (Though that movie is a masterpiece for many more reasons.) Jason Statham (who is my movie husband/lover/friend) was woefully underutilized. The ""comedy"" dialogue written for him was scattered and disorganized. Eh.

To my great surprise, this film actually delivered.  It is both really funny, and there are actually great action scenes, with smart comedy intermixed.

I just loved the scenes were Melissa McCarthy played the tough body guard.  She was spot on, and her timing and mannerisms were perfect!

I think this probably has to be one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long, long time...

They would get to hear the F word over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and on and on throughout the ENTIRE MOVIE!!! I don't know how or why people find that assault of profanity entertaining. If it wasn't for all that it could have been a good movie. Is there a shortage of writing talent and directing talent in Hollywood these days? The idea is good. The parody of 007 and other spy movies is good. Melissa McCarthy is a talented actress. Why not give her a decent script to showcase her acting instead of wasting her talent on constantly repeating the B word, the C word, the F word, the MF words, the S word and other assorted vulgarities? I would have given it 5 stars without the profanity.",1446595200,2,804,4.193548387096774

I found myself far too often disappointed with McCarthy's attempt at being funny but I loved the subtle comedy by Jason Statham so he's the one who saved the movie from being a pile of trash.

Oh well, at least Jason Statham did something different than his other roles which are all the same. With that said, Paul Feig did a lousy job of producing this movie and so I really can't see Ghostbusters 2016 Female Edition being any better than this was.",1446595200,,609,4.389380530973451

Although this is not a typical comedy and is kind of a blend of action and comedy and sort of a Bond spoof, this for the most part works.  Although I won't say this is laugh out loud funny all the way through, this does have its moments that are funny in various parts of the movie, although the film tends to lean toward action more than comedy.  McCarthy is her typical silly self but the jokes connect more than they miss.  Statham actually does a nice job at spoofing basically all of his typical roles he plays.  Although I won't say this is my favorite comedy, this is entertaining and I found it funny enough to make it worth watching.

By the end though, I was hurting from laughing so hard. Truly one of the funniest movies I've seen. There's definitely some vulgar humor, but much of the humor is subtle and smartly acted.

I am already rooting for a sequel so I can see more of McCarthy and Statham on the screen together. That was a wonderfully unexpected duo! They need to act together more often.",1446249600,,508,4.404255319148936

She is sent into the field for the first time after something happens to him and the agency finds that their agents have become targets by an international ring.  A seasoned agent (Jason Statham) is constantly getting in her way and causing more issues than he resolves.  I adore Melissa McCarthy and think this is one of her best films yet.

It got old for me. I expect that most folks won't care. If you don't then you will rate this higher than I do. The bad language just became irritating  What I'm saying is that I'm not necessarily against profane humor. I just feel that with Spy it was too much. It just wasn't funny for me after a while.

I didn't hate it. I did laugh some. Melissa McCarthy and the great cast carried it enough that I finished watching it. But after a while it was like that same joke over and over in the form of blurting profanity. I also finished watching because I wanted to see how the story played out. I liked the story.

This was a rental for me and I won't be buying it.

A clever idea for a movie with a good trailer, but felt cheated / abused when the movie is littered with needless cursing and vulgar language.  It actually takes a certain measure of talent and creativity to entertain and to write screenplays without having to using the F-word and the GD-word and the S-word and so on.  Of course, if you are not offended by a lot of needless cursing and taking the Lord's name in vain, then this is just the ticket for you.

Additionally, there are two split-second shots of a man's penis--and this was in the rated (not the unrated) version. The pictures did not add to the hilarity of the movie and were completely gratuitous.  I saw an even more edited version of the movie on a plane in September (sans penis) and it was just as funny.

The plot is adequate to support the various relationships and interactions, which are the real fun. Melissa McCarthy delivers such outrageous lines with a style that makes them really funny. Lots of great slapstick physical humor. It's also a lot of fun to see a big lady doing some pretty tricky spy fighting and other skills. The language used is absolutely foul, so beware if that is a problem for you. Also this version has some porno-style videos of a guy displaying his ""junk"" -- I don't know if the rated version of the movie contains this footage as well (my guess is that it was eliminated because it's pretty disgusting).

I don't recall laughing even once, and there was way too much cussing for my taste. I don't find spies/villains cursing at one another, and bickering, funny. None of the villains were impressive, frightening, alarming, funny, intelligent, interesting or scary. Excessive talking during major confrontations between hero's/villains when characters would've more believably been shooting rather than negotiating, was hard for me to swallow. The only sequence I liked was where the lead did a makeover in Italy. Usually I don't like slow motion but I liked her ""I am here, and I am hot"" slow mo walk as she heads for the casino. The only character I found funny was the lead's lady basement spy who tried to rein her in. Solid acting.",1445731200,,907,4.858064516129033

7235179,3,B00YRV20HY,"Spy is essentially a Melissa McCarthy action-comedy vehicle. Among her comedic peers, McCarthy is currently the reigning box-office draw. And it isn't hard to see why as she infuses the film with impressive physical and obvious verbal comedy. The most attractive part of Spy for audiences is the cast: McCarthy is clearly the star, but her supporting cast is strong as well. (1) Rose Byrne plays the Bulgarian villainess; Byrne is currently doing many comedic/silly films in order to soften her image (which is a result from the Damages TV Series) and she seems to be achieving success. (2) Jason Statham plays an over-the-top rogue who is as intense as he is clueless; it is a nice change of pace for the action film vet. (3) Finally, long-time character actress Allison Janney virtually steals the show from her co-stars as the wise-cracking CIA boss. Due to the strong script from writer-director Paul Feig, Spy is a character-driven comedy first and a plot driven comedy second. In other words, the comedy comes before the action and the result is lots of laughs",1445644800,,1066,4.895027624309392

7235679,4,B00YRV20HY,"I can't help it: I love Melissa McCarthy. Charismatic, funny, and full of energy she just brings every scene to life in this movie. Whether in a car chase or engaged in hand to hand combat she does major action star calibre work here.

Though some jokes are made about other's perceptions of her, her character is never the butt of the joke. She is always shown to be competent and skilled, and she is shown to be a smart and desirable woman throughout the movie.

The movie has everything that a spy movie should have: beautiful locales, gorgeous clothes (McCarthy doesn't spend the majority of the movie dressed like the ad campaign would have you believe), exciting action sequences, and a fast moving plot with a good amount of twists and turns.

Everyone in this movie is perfectly cast (and also, exceedingly attractive). McCarthy and Jason Statham have real chemistry and he is also very funny. Miranda Hart is an incredible gem of an actress who is absolutely hilarious and lovely in her role here (I was so excited to see her in such a big U.S. role!!).

Basically, this is a movie about unlikely back-ups stepping into the spotlight that manages to tell its story in a way that is positive and respectful to the characters and the actors playing them. Not gonna lie: it just made me feel good watching it, both in how well all the female characters were treated and how exciting and funny the writing was. McCarthy's kitchen fight scene and her dance floor scene with Statham were especially memorable.

I would say this movie is a solid four stars and definitely worth a watch.",1445472000,2,1588,4.637010676156583

While this may not be a surprise to many, and well placed instances would have made the movie funnier, the timing and frequency removed any viewer from the escape of enjoying a silly spy movie and threw them headfirst into a wall of foul language and ridiculous situations that made it impossible to enjoy at the end.

Melissa McCarthy did a very good job and stood out when she was finally able to open up and be the actual spy.

What is very rewarding is the quality of supporting roles in the movie. Jude Law is cool and stylish as ever. Rose Byrne competes with her seriously funny role in Bridesmaids, but it is Jason Statham, action star par excellence, who creates a funny persona I never expected from him. He should balance his other 43 action movies that will come out in the next 12 months with some comedy roles, because who knew he could be that funny.

Not really necessary to have a male private flashed in my face for 4 seconds (twice) or other graphic sexual scenes...don't appreciate that movies are heading this way.

7235791,3,B00YRV20HY,Would have been better without all the bad language.,1445040000,,52,4.888888888888889
7235792,4,B00YRV20HY,"This is easily the best of McCarthy's lead role movies, why because her character doesn't act like a bully and angry at the world woman for the whole film who thinks she comes across as strong by swearing abusive comments at everyone else.  She only does that during the second half of this one.  The first half has her as a much more likable character, the whole film is quite clever and a good contribution to the spy parody world.  Basically McCarthy's character has been trained with all the hand to hand combat skills, and ability to fly helicopters and planes and stuff like all Hollywood spies are, but because she looks like she does, has never been used in the field. Instead she's just Jude Law's character's ear piece voice who does all the cool and exciting in the field stuff while she watches through a camera.  Something goes wrong on one of his missions and she pleads to go into action as the identities of the other agents aren't so secret anymore.  She takes a little while to get used to and into the grove, meanwhile Jason Stratham's character is disgusted he's been sidelined for her and keeps turning up to save the day himself, but has an Inspector Gadget style habit of stuffing everything up and constantly needs to be saved.  Of course he never accepts that's what just happened.

Unfortunately we do see the foul mouth rants start up once her character becomes more comfortable in her role as a spy. I love swearing in films when its in content and enhances the plot or a scene but that's not what you get with McCarthy at times.  There's a real annoying scene where she just swears at and puts down an innocent bodyguard for about a five minute rant just to make herself look like the better bodyguard. You could also argue there's a bit of racist stereotyping with another spy who acts like the skunk from Looney Tunes towards her throughout the mission.  A lot of the big sight gags you'll know from the previews, but there's still plenty of good gags you won't have seen.  Definitely worth checking out.",1444953600,,2035,4.550684931506849

MM seems compelled to prove that Fat Girls Are Pretty in each of her movies.  In this one, it was just a mistake.  Running around in an evening gown didn't make it funnier, it dumbed the whole show down and made Melissa look stupid.

And the editor should be shot.  Honestly, just try to follow this.  It requires the concentration of Tom Cruse in Mission Impossible, and not what I expect or want from an MM movie.

The second half is more of the loud, in your face McCarthy that I'm getting a little tired of, personally. Generally though, the movie stayed entertaining throughout, with actress Miranda Hart stealing the show at times.

More than anything I'm glad to see a female heroine that doesn't look like she could get knocked over by a light breeze.

The best way to sum up the way I feel about this movie is that I didn't feel compelled to tell my friends to watch it, but I will watch it again when it's out on cable.",1444608000,,661,4.365853658536586

7236478,5,B00YRV20HY,"Melissa McCarthy is absolutely fearless.  She could take the safe route by making sequels to ""Identify Thief"" but chooses to extend herself and fly without a net.  There is no doubt that she is up to the comedic requirements of her role as CIA handler turned field agent but who knew that she could master the physical aspects of the role.  Props also to Jason Statham who lampoons his action hero persona here by playing a real twit.  I also liked Miranda Hart as McCarthy's nervous colleague from Langley.  The central plot involving an arms deal is serviceable but superfluous being the vehicle for the comedy and action.  Along with ""Kingsman-The Secret Service"" these are the best espionage comedies since ""True Lies"".  Look fast for McCarthy's real life spouse, Ben Falcone, as a tourist with a hankering for Popeye's.",1444521600,,824,4.884892086330935

Melissa McCarthy is not my first choice in this case usually, but given the other actors and the scenes from the trailer, I gave it a shot. I was positively surprised! It is a very funny movie with comedy-like action.

It has some funny moments, but also some real duds as it trys to hard to make McCarthy an expert fighter instead of relying on her wit.

Instead this movie really belongs to two other. First Miranda Hart shines in a small subordinate role, she is naturally very funny. But this movie really belongs to Jason Statham whose Rick Ford Character is a spot on lampoon of roles he has played in action films. Every time he is on the screen you can't help but laugh.

It's worth viewing just to see agent Rick Ford.",1444435200,2,678,4.248062015503876

She's a great comedic actress to begin with but she takes it to a whole new level with this role. She's beautiful and shows that it's possible to be a super star without being stick thin.
And I gotta say that when I heard Jason Statham was going to be in this movie, I was bummed out. I just didn't want to see him do ANOTHER super staid, serious action hero. He completely surprised me! I'm fact, I think he made me laugh as many times as Melissa did. Kudos to him for stepping out of character.
Jude Law was Jude Law, what can I say? He's just as beautiful as Melissa McCarthy and can act his a** off in anything he does.
Rose Byrne was fabulous as well but that shouldn't come as a surprise either. She's a damn good actress, comedic or dramatic.

7236820,5,B00YRV20HY,"Spy  is a movie featuring Melissa McCarthy as CIA analyst Susan Cooper.  She has a strong working relationship with Bradley Fine (Jude Law) and a close friendship with fellow CIA colleague Nancy B Artingstall (Miranda Hart). Susan Cooper ends up volunteering herself to be directly in the field due to her feeling to go after Raya Boyanov (Rose Byrne) after what she sees involving her coworker Bradley Fine.  Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) decides to give Susan Cooper a chance to be in the field with greater CIA responsibilities despite protests from fellow CIA agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham). Coopers new assignments have her directly dealing with both Raya Boyanov and charismatic but dangerous Sergio De Luca (Bobby Canavale). Meanwhile Susan Cooper is assigned various aliases to protect her identity and safeguard her cover and along the way meets an admirer who calls himself Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz). Celebrity 50 Cent makes an appearance in Spy and the movie lists some of the following locations/settings: Varna Bulgaria, Langley Virginia, Rome Italy, and Budapest Hungary.

7237595,5,B00YRV20HY,"Just when I was ready to give up on Melissa McCarthy for running her shtick into the ground, she surprises me this gem of a comedy. Melissa McCarthy stars as Susan Cooper, a single woman who works behind a desk for the CIA. When the identities of all active agents are compromised, she enters the field to track down an arms dealer looking to sell a nuclear bomb. Spy movies don't really rank high among my favorite genres (although Daniel Craig as Bond is definitely changing that), but this SPY's main selling point (among many) is that it knows how silly it is and just plays along. If one were to critique SPY on its plot, of course one would conclude that it's convoluted and nonsensical. However, the comedic writing and performances are all top-notch here, making considerations of plot almost irrelevant. My main issue with McCarthy before was her excessively profane, loud and obnoxious screen persona. Thankfully, she tones it down a lot here and goes for a more subtle approach. Her character does kind of become more outre as the film progresses, but it was organic to the central theme of a woman coming into her own in a male-dominated profession. In terms of exploring that, Rose Byrne (NEIGHBORS) plays very well opposite McCarthy as the arms dealer that Cooper is after. Even though they're on opposite sides of the law, they share a bond over being taking seriously as professionals in their respective fields, so to speak. There was even great comic work from non-comic actors like Jude Law and Jason Statham, who is essentially parodying his action star roles. It was over-the-top, but oh so funny. I also liked Alison Janney as Susan Cooper's CIA boss. Outside of the writing and acting, all of the technical bits were well-done, if unspectacular, and the action was well-choreographed. There were a few moments where the CGI didn't look so great, but the cheesy nature of the effects kind of fit with the overblown satirical comedy that film was going for. Finally, there was some pacing issues towards the end of the second act, and the beginning of the third. Maybe 5-10 minutes could have trimmed, but I was laughing so much I barely noticed. Overall, SPY is perhaps the second best comedy I've seen this year (behind KINGSMAN). It was able to take a comedian who I was beginning to tire of, and make her funny again. It also was just plain hilarious the whole way through, and definitely worth your time/money.",1443830400,2,2436,4.747641509433962

7237619,4,B00YRV20HY,"Spy: Twentieth Century Fox Blu-Ray version rated R (extras unrated)

Everyone knows this is a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Jude Law and others.  McCarthy plays a headquarters-based CIA operative who typically does background investigating and coaches a field agent (Jude Law) via earpiece when hes on sensitive missions.  Due to a loss of cover for the CIAs best field agents, she ends up getting herself sent to the field, as no one is apt to recognize her.

I first became aware of McCarthys comedic talent in Bridesmaids, where she had a fairly small but scene-stealing part.  Since that time shes held the lead positions in several films, including this latest release.

This film is good, though a bit more subtle than the audience might expect.  Its really a hybrid spy/action film and comedy, and some of the comedy may be obscure for those who come to it just to watch Melissa McCarthy.  For example: The beginning and end are wonderful take-offs on many James Bond movies (as is a fairly short scene in which shes assigned the high-tech toys for her mission).  Second: Jason Statham burst onto the action-movie genre with Transporter, an impressive piece of work, followed by 3 sequels that met with mixed reviews, and then the execrable Crank and Crank 2: High Voltage.  His CIA field agent in this film is really an hilarious over-the-top parody of his roles in Crank and Crank 2, and unless you watched those movies you WILL NOT appreciate how funny his stuff here truly is.  Lastly and more obviously theres the slightly subtle comedy of McCarthy being excited to go live in the field, but repeatedly being given the most frumpy imaginable cover identities

There are a number of specials on the Blu-Ray; the only one I watched so far was one of the gag reels which made it abundantly clear that this cast had a blast making the movie.  I love watching scenes in which an actor repeatedly cannot keep a straight face!  Oh--late addition--there are a WHOLE LOT of specials on the Blu-Ray edition of the film which make it TOTALLY DESIRABLE even if you watched the film in the theatre!  Almost all the specials are FUNNY, and together (not counting the inevitable ""commentary track"") they seem to comprise almost another 50% duration added to the original film!  That's a whole lot more comedy.  It is obvious that an awful lot of ad-libbing went on, and even with all this extra content, we are still missing a lot of ad-lib work that simply could not be included....

If I had just one critical suggestion to offer it would have been to trim down the run time from 120 minutes to about 90 minutes; I think it would have been possible to do that and still retain coherence and all of the funniest stuff in the film.

Aside from the comedy it's just a good spy movie. Think James Bond with more mistakes by the spies.

It's got a high production quality and a good story. I've been waiting for this to be available for rent from Amazon (as opposed to buying it) and it was well worth the wait. It's a great movie night film.",1443744000,,575,4.171171171171171

7237693,4,B00YRV20HY,"Melissa McCarthy is one of my favorite actresses. She is down to earth and so funny. One of the funniest Saturday Night Live belongs to the woman. She puts her heart into everything she does, and this film is the culmination of her talents. Bridesmaids was funny, but in this film, McCarthy is the star.

She plays Susan Cooper a CIA agent, but relegated to a desk job, as the eyes and ears of Jude Lsw, a super spy. Then, comes her turn, along with Miranda Hart, the funny woman from the UK, she goes out on the job, Miranda is her eyes and ears. Alison Janney plays the head of the CIA, and is superior in every way. Jason Statham, another super spy with an ego to boot has gone rogue and one of McCarthy's new identities rescues him at every turn. A lot of laughs, particularly when Rose Byrne comes aboard. McCarthy is at her best when she is playing off another character, and this is her film.

Great script and superb acting by McCarthey and crew. A film not to miss.

But I still decided to go ahead and rent it bc I  am a fan and I wanted to believe she could still kick a** especially that some of her previous comedies were flat....

I laughed and laughed then when I thought OK I think they are serious now about spying and finding people... just right then they crack another hilarious, insane comment,... well you get the picture, you will smile, giggle and laugh out loud.... until the end.

7237773,4,B00YRV20HY,"I didn't know what to expect from Spy ... the movie opens up with Super Spy Bradley Fine (Jude Law) on a mission in the field while back home in the basement office tactical support is provided by CIA Agent Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy).

From the opening you think Spy is going to be a serious James Bond-esque action, thriller but what you get with Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Jude Law and Miranda Hart is a hilarious spy movie spoof in the realm of Austin Powers.

Spy is funny movie, but not for kids (R-rated, tons of F-bombs, adult themes & nudity).
My biggest surprise in the movie was the comedic performance of Jason Statham. We're used to seeing Jason play serious, straight faced, action hero type roles but in Spy Statham proves he can actually be quite funny too.

Overall Spy is hilarious, entertaining and funny. My only complaint about this movie - is that it's too long. At almost two hours for a comedy Spy struggles sometimes to keep the audience engaged and script becomes convoluted and tiresome at times. Director Paul Feig could have cut out 20-30 minutes out of this film and still had a fantastically funny movie.

Spy may be Melissa McCarthy's best movie to date and director Paul Feig's best film since Bridesmaids.",1443571200,,1261,4.6923076923076925

7237857,3,B00YRV20HY,"""We need someone to follow De Luca without being detected."" Susan Cooper (McCarthy) works for the CIA but not in a position she wants. She helps agents in the field by monitoring monitors. When something goes wrong on a mission the entire company is compromised. Susan is the only one that can go in undetected. What started off as a intel mission only becomes dangerous and Susan is the only one that can stop the threat. I am a pretty big Melissa McCarthy fan, although I think her character is getting a little played out. I said after Tammy that she maybe only has 1 or 2 more movies left where she plays the same type before it gets old. I was wrong. This is the one movie too many. I'm not saying this is a bad movie because I did laugh quite a bit, but the jokes didn't seem original and this just felt tired and forced. Statham was actually pretty funny in this, but was very underused. There isn't really a whole lot to say about this other than that. Overall, a standard McCarthy movie that is starting to lose it magic. Worth seeing but I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices for it. I give it a B-.",1443398400,,1108,4.2559241706161135

7237991,5,B00YRV20HY,"With two of my boyfriends in this film, (Statham and Law), it didn't really matter to me what it was about because I was gonna watch it anyway. Thankfully, it was a barrel of laughs and worth watching. Them being it is became a plus.
Lots of action in this film too, being the spy theme, so watching it with the hubby went over well. He loves watching things get blown up, which there was tons of. Then mixed with Melissa McCarthy's crazy comedy made it completely hilarious. It was a decent story line too, almost like a Bond satire.
Not for the kids though. There is a reason this is R rated. Very graphic moments, and tons of swearing. I like that stuff but it's not good for the lil ones.
Lots of adults are gonna love this one though! I know I did, and so did the hubby!",1443225600,,775,4.173333333333333

The great thing about this movie is that there is an ACTUAL story. The dialogue is cheesy, yes, but it's part of the fun. The jokes can sometimes be a miss, but as a whole, it's a very solid film.

Super funny, vulnerable, potty-mouthed, and a real icon for women with her great strength of character and fearlessness. This pic was hilarious--definitely not for the kids! The language is super filthy, which makes it even funnier IMO. And Jason Statham--who knew that guy could be such a buffoon and pull it off...no sign of that suave, dangerous dude I've always loved. Rose Byrne is hilarious, just like in Bridesmaids. Allison Jaynie (sp?) almost stole the movie with her deadpan wit. She's awesome. This was a dead-on James Bond takeoff, and so worth it.

7238299,5,B00YRV20HY,"This film sends up so many things that it's hard to know where to start. Firstly, it most obviously sends up Jude Law's 'James Bond' tux-in-a-casino type character. Next, it satirises Jason Statham's tough guy secret agent routine and finally the ludicrously contrived twists of good fortune with which she is blessed utterly sends up the idea of Melissa McCarthy's dream of transforming her desk job into a field job. That said, Melissa McCarthy does go into the field where her startling good fortune enables her to successfully take out north of 50 tough guy baddies while saving Jude Law and Jason Statham's lives. There is much more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. Personally I found the relentlessly returning fat joke about Melissa McCarthy a tad tedious after I'd heard it for the tenth time, and the language seemed excessively and unnecessarily blue - there were many more F-bombs than laughs in this movie. Overall, though, it is a fun film. But as far as espionage movies go I probably preferred the recent 'Kingsman'. That said, however, this has some lovely comic performances in it. If you're a Melissa McCarthy fan you'll love 'Spy'. Also, I found Jason Statham absolutely hilarious and Rose Byrne as the classy femme fatale was also excellent. Apparently Jason Statham was directed to improvise a lot of his lines including most of his funny ones. More comic masterpieces to come from him, I suspect. And Alison Janney was superb as the CIA deputy director. The Budapest locations worked well enough and it was neat of the writer/producer/director, Paul Feig, to include himself in a cameo in the dodgy Paris hotel where he plays the drunken hotel guest who walks into a wall and knocks himself cold. It's got jokes, Rolls Royces, Italian lakeside villas, a casino, car chases, nukes-for-sale, gadgets, a villain with a walking stick and a body count to match a war movie.",1442275200,22,1896,4.854938271604938

Less than halfway through this movie, I turned to my wife and said, ""This is much better than Bridesmaids,"" as she completed that sentence. I think the focus on just being unapologetically crass and silly made the difference for me--no detours into avant garde moments of discomfort or ""real life"" trumps laughs scenes.

There are so much language from that point that it is almost unbearable. The film would be a 5 if they cut back on the language. The language really ruins the experience for me.

Also, what bothers a lot of people the most about this film is the penis pictures...while I am not a fan of nudity in film, I am angered that so many people are disgusted with recent male nudity yet never complain about female nudity in films. In the past ten to fifteen years, male nudity has increased in films (Wild Things, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hall Pass, etc.) and this upsets so many people! They think this should not be included, yet women are still seen nude in countless films and there is never any outrage! Nudity is nudity, period.",1442016000,,905,4.58641975308642

7238406,2,B00YRV20HY,"With THIS CAST, you'd think the writers would be required to rise to the occasion and write, right??  WTF, the F-word was the most used word.  There were so many f-ing F-words, was everyone fricking Tony Scarface?!!  The Closed-Caption went from ""F*%K#*G POLLEN"" to a suicide announcement repeating along the bottom of the screen for the remainder of the movie.  The writers must be the grown-up scriptwriters from Blair Witch. ...  Or, all the money was spent on the cast that the writers had to be recruited from MTV wanna-be writers pool?

After about half-way through, I was sitting on the edge of my seat but not from the movie being ""George Smiley spy-ish"" and/or a thrilling comedy.  NOOOOOOOO,  just trying not to miss ANY line(s) without the f-ing F-word.  And the 15 year old neighbor kid was right:  This is THE best f-ing movie that Silent Bob was not in, and a minus-5 because there were no farts.

Really, I'm not a prude, I just hate the ""insert F-word here to replace the humor.""  When I think of comedy - good comedy - that uses the F-word frequently, there should at the very least be humor first.  Like George Carlin, Richard Pryor or Lewis Black.  But this was reminiscent of school papers having a word count requirement and the words ""Very, very and Interesting"" taking over the writer's 100 word theme paper.  (I'm thinking A Christmas Story here:  ""But, the F-word will blow your eye out"")

Maybe, there should be a new genre:  Movies With No Attributes But F-words.  Hmm?  FFFR-17L,NH could be its rating.

Maybe I am the wrong one here?  Was this movie's intended audience teenagers?",1442016000,,1609,4.691756272401434

7238409,4,B00YRV20HY,"Very funny as always, Melissa McCarthy is good at creating characters and this is right up her alley. Unfortunately, its not for the impressionable kiddies because there is violence and blood and language oh boy is there language. I think if this is ever going to general tv, they would need to dub half the dialog to pass the PG rating. I feel the movie could have stood on its own merits without the vulgarity and a bit less gore. Directors should take a cue from Hitchcock, less is more, when he hinted at the violence and left the rest to our imaginations, we could imagine worse than what they show us now.
Keep the kiddies at bay and watch this movie when they are away.",1442016000,4,676,4.373015873015873

by actually keeping up with McCarthy in funny!  Even the few ""serious"" moments were
well done and not awkwardly sappy.  Jason Statham is a real master of dead-pan comedy.

hoping for a sequel (if they can get that crew back together!)  Alison Janey McCarthy's
pal.  Heck, even Fifty Cent was hilarious!",1441756800,2,473,4.9113924050632916
7238515,5,B00YRV20HY,"How to laugh out loud often enough to annoy the other people in your airplane seat row? Watch Spy using earphones during a long trip! I confess, I was just trying to while away the time and not expecting that much when I bought Spy to watch on board. But boy did Spy show me!

Susan Cooper is a CIA field agent who has willingly been relegated to the basement, where she is the behind-the-scene reason for agent Bradley Fines success. When hes on a mission, they are connected via earphone and she has an array of computer monitors in front of her.  She can tell him, Go left or You have a little friend [killer] on the landing.  (The CIA wishes it had this capability for real.)

The fully-trained Cooper is willing to remain the trusted sidekick because she has a major crush on Fine. Maybe even shes in love with him.  When a crisis forces her boss to send Cooper into the field, Susan is determined to show that she still has the stuff to be an effective field agent. This is not so easy when the first alias they give her is a Cat Lady.

This 119-minute movie is a hoot.  The ending is perfect  make sure to watch to the very very end. I was half afraid that, after her success, Susan Cooper was going to devolve into a needy supplicant, and Im glad that they didn't go that route.

Spy is rated R for: Language throughout, violence, and some sexual content including brief graphic nudity. I thought the violence was more tame than the typical of action movie (Id rate it an early James Bond-like) and the nudity so brief I cant remember it (maybe it was cut for the airplane).  The F-bomb is dropped a LOT. I laughed so hard that I would love to give this movie to my folks, but Ive decided not to because of the language. However, I am buying it for us when it comes out on DVD.

The great thing with Spy is that the plot thickens and so do the laughs!  This movie builds, so that it is funnier in the end than in the beginning.  It ends well, and you will appreciate every weirdo character you have met along the way.

Spy is also a pretty great action movie.  Even McCarthy gets it on tough guy style.  You're going to enjoy this fun, witty film.",1441670400,,639,4.422413793103448

7238687,5,B00YRV20HY,"Ssssssspy!!!!!!!!! 5 STARS!

Spoof movies like Spy rarely get the awards and credit for all that they do! The audience sees Melissa McCarthy's character as a strong leading female once again. She is now also maintaining a even higher level of comedy at the intelligence/secret level globally.

This plot is filled with the hilarious jokes like those in Identity Theft. But, Spy, is also very independent of that type casting, with a new type of character for McCarthy, with her bringing the jokes to the fight.

There are many new scenes and types of humor, and unexpected turns, and unforseeable plot twists. The unpredictable story ending is expected of this comedy and the Spy genre, and it is delivered in a timely and entertaining way.

There are several big car chases, and even some car crashes!

One crash occurs when McCarthy's character attempts to drive a awkwardly designed motorcycle that has a roof, making it lopsided, causing her to lose balance, crashing it before her chase begins. Her trash talking of the design flaw and frustration with the lame vehicle is hilarious.

There is also a jet saved from crashing by actress Melissa McCarthy. But of course please realize this occured in her own style of doing hilarious comedy. This was done where several jokes and hilarious scenes were added during the save, proving McCarthy's diverse comedic/action acting abilities are always somewhat unpredetermined. It was very realistic action, even though it was also an awkard sequence of comedic events to save the jet, hilarious. Some vulgarities added to the jokes and comedy, making the acting more real and more dimensionally hilarious!

In summary, people were saved, villains were sought and apprehended, and the plot twists very funny!

Easily the best action comedy of 2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1441584000,23,1809,5.129251700680272

7238741,5,B00YRV20HY,"This was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I laughed so hard I peed my pants! Melissa McCarthy is my new hero. She's a great comedic actress to begin with but she takes it to a whole new level with this role. She's beautiful and shows that it's possible to be a super star without being stick thin.
And I gotta say that when I heard Jason Statham was going to be in this movie, I was bummed out. I just didn't want to see him do ANOTHER super staid, serious action hero. He completely surprised me! I'm fact, I think he made me laugh as many times as Melissa did.  Kudos to him for stepping out of character.
Jude Law was Jude Law, what can I say? He's just as beautiful as Melissa McCarthy and can act his a** off in anything he does.
Rose Byrne was fabulous as well but that shouldn't come as a surprise either. She's a damn good actress, comedic or dramatic.
As soon as this movie was over I was looking to see if they were gonna make a sequel (fingers crossed) because I can't wait to watch Melissa McCarthy on more super spy adventures.

Melissa McCarthy seems like a very bright actress trapped in large body.  She plays an emotional masochist in this film who has her day and shines when no one thinks she can.  The film IS well-made.

Melissa McCarthy is Susan Cooper, a CIA desk analyst who must take to the field when the active agents, including Susan's crush Bradley Fine (Law), are compromised by a Bulgarian mobster's daughter, Rayna Boyanov (Byrne), who also happens to have a suitcase nuke to sell. Cooper turns out to have real talent for the job. The ensuing chase takes her, in a variety of assumed identities (a running joke through the movie), all over Europe, while dodging a CIA traitor and while tripping over rogue agent Rick Ford (Statham). The plot is a nicely crafted James Bond knockoff that manages to be both dramatic and funny.

7238822,5,B00YRV20HY,"Melissa McCarthy's comedy has an unfortunate tendency to go over the top; I'm happy to report that this is NOT the case here (and you WILL become inured to the f-word after the first 20 times you hear it). Written and directed by Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids,"" and ""The Heat""), we are transported to an R-rated James Bond'ish film, complete with iconic title credits and a song that evokes the genre.

This movie opens in the middle of an important mission to find and confiscate a nuclear device before it can be used against the United States. We see a supremely effective American CIA agent in constant communication with his high-tech handler in Langley, although they aren't even on the same continent. She provides tactical information from heat-detecting devices to warn him of approaching enemies. They make a top-notch team...until he is killed. Now the CIA needs a new face that isn't known to the enemy.

The cast:
  * Jude Law (""Hugo"") is perfect as the super agent. He has the looks, the manner and the wardrobe.
  * Melissa McCarthy (""Identity Thief"") is his heartbroken handler. She had been carrying a secret torch for her partner and now wants revenge, so she volunteers. Each new identity is more challenging (and funnier) than the last.
  * Allison Janney (""Mom"") is their boss. She doesn't like our heroine, but knows it is vital to prevent that nuclear device from being smuggled into the United States...and our gal's face isn't known...
  * Rose Byrne (""Neighbors"") This glamorous super-spy (with lots of hair!) is negotiating a deal. Nuclear devices are extremely profitable!
  * Jason Statham (""Parker"") You have NEVER heard such an egotistical, overly confident bunch of twaddle in your life. Statham is clearly having a ball doing a hilarious sendup of his usual super-macho personae.
  * Miranda Hart (""Call the Midwife"") Meanwhile, back at Langley, our heroine's gawky BFF has become, by default, her handler. She's confused and frightened but she's not stupid!
  * Bobby Cannavalle (""Danny Collins"") This wealthy industrialist is in the market for a nuclear device.

Of course we travel to lovely locations: Italy (one Italian agent learned his British accent from watching ""Downton Abbey""); MANY scenic spots in Hungary; plus some great locales in France. We see vehicular mayhem (with our heroine on a scooter), physical combat (she's surprisingly good), numerous gunfights (she's a crack shot) and some aerial stunts (she learned on the trainer at Langley). We do NOT see sweaty bodies or blowie uppie stuff...(well, just a little bit).

We enjoy laugh-out-loud comedy with very few ""fat"" jokes. Even though we see agents, double agents and even a triple agent or two, we have several people to root for and we can trust that this will have a happy ending. Whew!",1439251200,112,2790,4.989200863930885
7238823,5,B00YRV20HY,"I must preface this with I'm not a huge Melissa McCarthy fan.  I don't care for the same crude character she consistently plays so I was surprised when I kept laughing every time I saw the trailer for this.  We decided to give it a go and my Lord am I glad we did!  In a time where Hollywood seems obsessed with rebooting everything, this was original, hilarious and we laughed so hard from beginning to end that I immediately wanted to see it again.  She was hilarious in this and was a good mix of sweet, funny, the usual crude stuff at a point but just all around funny.  Jason Statham was a surprise comedian delivering some of the most wild, off the wall lines of the movie.  I can't wait to get the DVD as McCarthy has said there are some hilarious extras on it.",1439164800,98,768,4.190476190476191
7238824,1,B00YRV20HY,"I could cut off both of my hands and still be left with enough fingers to count how many times I laughed during this movie. Its not worth your money. In fact, if you had the opportunity to watch it for free, it wouldn't be worth your time. If you had the opportunity to be paid to watch this movie, it still wouldn't be worth it. Even if you have nothing else to do and the alternative is staring at a wall for two hours, this movie is not worth it. No matter who you are, how much money or time you have to waste, you, your time, and your money are worth more than this. I wouldn't spend a Canadian penny on this trash.",1439078400,7,620,3.968

7238826,3,B00YRV20HY,"I remember the days when to make you laugh no off color words must be used, so I know is possible to do it, This is an entertaining movie and I know that M. M. always use off words, I don't understand who thinks that repeating them time and time again is funny, I will probably get a lot of thumbs down but this is my perspective. 3 stars for the movie because it is watchable.",1439078400,7,377,3.973684210526316
7238827,5,B00YRV20HY,"A great role for Melissa McCarthy and Rose Bryne is an amazing villan. I see one movie in the theatre a year, but it was so funny I went to see it a second time.",1438905600,2,161,3.6285714285714286
7238828,4,B00YRV20HY,"This 2015 movie features Melissa McCarthy along with Jude Law, Jason Statham, and Rose Byrne in a terrifically funny spy drama. Melissa McCarthy is Susan Cooper, a CIA desk analyst who must take to the field when the active agents, including Susan's crush Bradley Fine (Law), are compromised by a Bulgarian mobster's daughter, Rayna Boyanov (Byrne), who also happens to have a suitcase nuke to sell. Cooper turns out to have real talent for the job. The ensuing chase takes her, in a variety of assumed identities (a running joke throughout the movie), all over Europe, while dodging a CIA traitor and while tripping over rogue agent Rick Ford (Statham). The plot is a surprisingly well-done James Bond knockoff that manages to be both dramatic and funny. You have to like McCarthy's brand of humor, but this movie is recommended as good entertainment.",1438905600,2,852,4.965034965034965
7238829,4,B00YRV20HY,"Based upon the success of ""The Heat"" a film role was written for Melissa McCarthy. I think everyone knows the plot where a desk jockey agent goes into the field with expected results. Jason Statham, while having a minor role, provided laughs with his serious description of impossible spy antics.

Many scenes were spy film spoofs. The film teetered on cheese, not knowing whether it should venture there or not. The main problem I had with this film, is that I kept mentally comparing it to ""The Heat"" and frankly, ""The Heat"" was funnier. The film is worth seeing, but there is nothing spectacular about the cinematography that demands it be seen on the large scene.

Guide: Excessive F-bombs. No sex. Brief male nudity.",1438819200,10,721,4.806451612903226
