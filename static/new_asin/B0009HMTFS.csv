8061090,2,B0009HMTFS,"Unless you know nothing about the life of Truman Capote, don't bother with this DVD.  It's way overpriced too.",1498694400,,110,4.7894736842105265
8061091,5,B0009HMTFS,"Tis is a great piece and teaching tool. It's not too long (About 50 minutes, I think), and provides lovely insight into this troubled author's life. I show it to my students every year, and they are intrigued.",1434499200,,209,4.526315789473684
8061092,2,B0009HMTFS,"I'm interested in literature, so naturally, I purchased this DVD. I am also regularly impressed with the  quality  the BIOGRAPHY series put out by A and E. That said, this ""Biography"" doesn't focus upon the things that interested me, but focused upon Truman Capote's  celebrity connections and his demise  by alcohol, loss of purpose, and drugs. The last twenty minutes show a Capote that could be any stumblebum  -- except for the fact that this  stumblebum is videoed in one of the most embarassing  dispays of talent loss since Jack Kerouac went on a talk show lo those years ago.

The DVD corruptly focuses upon the years where  Capote  was doing the Club scene during the  last years of his life. The focus upon his regalia by A and E is just a cheap shot, and the omission that he was despised by Gore Vidal is never mentioned--- even though they were the competing writers of their decade. And the  praise heaped upon  Capote by Norman Mailer is selective Pabulum.

I think the film, Capote, offers a better understanding of Truman Capote's faults; however, this  A  and  E  is not  a biography of much worth.",1183420800,,1116,4.630769230769231
8061093,4,B0009HMTFS,"The video is everything you'd expect from the A & E Biography series.  Factual, balanced, highly relevant film clips are all part of this film biography.  This work gives one a better understanding of and appreciation for Capote's major works, particularly ""In Cold Blood"".  I've viewed it three times and on each occasion, I pick up something new.  Very good.",1156377600,,360,4.95
8061094,5,B0009HMTFS,"If you're looking for a documentary on the life of Truman Capote, you have two choices:

* Truman Capote, A&E DVD Archives (2005) [ASIN: B0009HMTFS]; and

* Great Writers: Truman Capote (2000) [ASIN: B000FC2HNG]

Neither one is inexpensive, so I would have liked a review saying which one is better. As it turned out, I ended up buying and watching both. Although both programs are of roughly the same length, the differences are significant.

The Arts & Entertainment (A & E) version is clearly better. It has more information, photographs, film footage, and interesting interviews than the Great Writers version, which seems to be trying to make some sort of artistic statement of its own - lots of pictures of grass waving in the wind, country roads, etc., none of which are terribly relevant.

You will be better off buying the A & E program.",1150416000,,846,4.8068965517241375
8061095,4,B0009HMTFS,"Despite facing homophobia, heightism, and anti-effeminacy, Truman Capote became a star.  Unfortunately, like so many others, drugs and alcohol did him in.  Many viewers will relate or be fascinated by the subject's extreme highs and lows.  For those who loved the film ""Capote,"" this will give them a longitudinal look at his life, not just his Kansas days.  For those who read Gerald Clarke's biography, you actually get to see Mr. Clarke speak.  Unlike most men with clefts that look like the dot of an I, Mr. Clarke's cleft is shaped like an upper-case T: it is soooooo adorable.  As many say comparing fictional books with movies, the biographical book was better than this A&E special, though the special is laudable too.  This A&E work doesn't talk about Capote's intense rivalry with Gore Vidal.  It doesn't mention the author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" who got exceptional coverage in the ""Capote"" film.  Also, it is not mentioned that one of Truman's photos was the cover of a record by Morrissey's ex-band, The Smiths.",1133481600,,1028,4.895953757225434
