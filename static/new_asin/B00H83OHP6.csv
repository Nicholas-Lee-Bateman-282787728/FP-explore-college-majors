8630733,5,B00H83OHP6,"This movie isn't for everyone. But for me, I found it beautifully captivating. Moving. If anything, the scenery of any M. Blash's films keeps you coming back for more. Instead of focusing on their dialogue, you find yourself focusing on their expressions. You become each, and every one of them. Trying to feel the emotions they feel. If you are a fan of his other film ""Lying"", there is no doubt you'll enjoy ""The Wait"".",1504915200,,421,4.626666666666667

8630736,3,B00H83OHP6,"The Wait is the type of independent drama that the critics always love and that I usually hate. I decided to watch it though, because of one very special cast member, who is really coming into his own, Devon Gearhart. Even since I saw this young man in the movie Canvas, I knew he was really something special. Gearhart's unique ability to get the viewers to empathize with whatever character he is playing, gives him a strength that very few actors have. I knew from the description that the character of Ben, in The Wait, was a perfect outlet for him to express this ability and he does not disappoint. As for the rest of the film, it is a dark, eclectic film, full of odd symbolism and strange music, that to be honest is a bit over my head, but it's also a film that most audiences can relate to. The family portrayed, whose last name we never know, is pulling together and preparing for the tragic death of their terminally ill mother. The family is preparing themselves for the worst, that could happen any day, when they come in contact with a psychic. The psychic tells them that their mother is special and destine to come back from the grave, leading the family to not only hold off on making any funeral plans, but the prediction leads them to prepare a welcome home party. As I said the storyline is strange, the film is full of strange symbolism, and it moves rather slowly, but the cast here is unbelievable. Aside from Gearhart's out of this world performance, that will leave even the toughest person in tears, both Chloe Sevigny and Jena Malone are fantastic as the two eldest sisters. The sisters, always at odds are trying to pull themselves together for the inevitable, but are once again drawn apart by the psychic's prediction, leading to a dramatic rift in the storyline. The bottom line is, that The Wait, isn't a film for me, but I can see many people really enjoying it. The story is unique, the performances are terrific, and the future of Hollywood may be on display in this relatively unknown masterpiece.",1394496000,,2034,4.560109289617486
8630737,1,B00H83OHP6,"I couldn't keep my eyes open during this flick. It was long, odd & really hard to hear the dialogue. You keep waiting for something exciting to happen, and when it does, it happens at the very end.",1393804800,2,197,4.2105263157894735
8630738,5,B00H83OHP6,"I always find Chloe Sevigny a fascinating actress to watch, no matter what her role in a film. ""The Wait"" is a nice quiet review of losing a loved one and then believing in the unbelievable, while finding love.",1391990400,2,210,4.410256410256411
