As someone who loves figure skating, I appreciated how the movie depicts the dedication and effort required to pursue the dream.  But, more importantly, the movie showed family, love, friendship, and perseverance.  Osama Baiul lost her family when she was very young, but she promised her mother she would follow her dream, and she did. This is the movie everyone should watch before they give up...they may decide to soldier on.",1517616000,,493,4.9156626506024095

A sweet, young kid at the time of the story, with no one but herself, her God-given
gift to skate wonderfully, and memory of her promise to her dear mother to move
her to greatness!!  Thank God for people like her.  I know a lot of things have
changed for her as her life has moved along.  She's Jewish so I feel a kinship.  My
wife also comes from the same heritage with ancestry in the Ukraine.  If you like
really good, true stories, you'll love this one.",1385164800,,542,4.316831683168317

The acting and stuff was really good, I think so anyway. I definetely think you should see it!",1123459200,,246,4.145833333333333
