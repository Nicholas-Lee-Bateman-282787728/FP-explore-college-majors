8509486,1,B0073W5UG2,"This man is a charlatan. Unfortunately he knows just enough to take advantage of people. Beware....the guy has never trained a dancer in his life. For a time, I was curious (and amused) by his videos, but now that people are taking him seriously, I'm nervous.",1522454400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8509487,3,B0073W5UG2,"I like the information in the DVD. I did not like the production quality of the video. For example, there were times it would have been helpful if we could have seen a little better the part of the student's body Eric was addressing. Sometimes it was difficult to see the correction being applied.",1365465600,2,297,4.518518518518518
8509488,5,B0073W5UG2,"Eric Conrad is up to something that is very necessary and welcome for a lot of us with a lot of training in the US. This DVD is an in-depth demonstration of Vaganova-based training that can correct and enhance the non-systematic and often haphazard training of a lot of us in this country.

I came to ballet late so had never intentions of becoming a performer but I have been a serious student studying with some of the best teachers in NYC and San Francisco. I have not only studied technique (ballet, jazz, modern, tap, and some character) but anatomy, kinesiology, and even physics of dance (at the Teachers College of Columbia University, among other places.) I have worked in the nonprofit world and am familiar with questions of funding and audience development. Integrating all this, my interest is in dance education in the broadest sense, namely not just the training of professional dancers, but all-around training (technique, dance history and criticism) for non-professionals and lovers of dance who are extremely important for the financial health and survival of dance in countries where dance is not supported by the state.

I discovered Eric by chance on YouTube and my first reaction to his blog (which was about turn-out) was: who the hell does this guy think he is? But I kept watching, going from blog to blog. And most importantly, I tried his tips in class. OMG!! For the first time I understood what placement and turn-out are and why they are so fundamental. I too had been exposed to a lot of what goes by Vaganova ""syllabus"" in the US. But as Eric points out there is a great difference between syllabus and pedagogy. I have seen tremendous improvement in my own technique and I feel my eyes have been opened to what was missing in my own work. This is not at all to discredit my American teachers to whom I am grateful in ways only fellow dance students can understand, but to acknowledge a certain missing link that Eric has provided for me.

I am sure there are many other individuals who are ""on to"" the secrets of Russian technique, all over the world. Eric does NOT claim that he is the only one. He only claims that there is hostility to a mode of training (of which he is a proponent) by the ballet world in the US. The tone of a couple of reviews on this very site is proof of that. In fact, this hostility has been very uncalled-for and discouraging for Eric which is a cause of chagrin for those of us who would like to learn more from him.

I read the lengthy review by Anonymous Human very carefully. She is right in that Eric has never been a professional performer so there's a great deal that he is not experienced with. But I'm sure as a professional she is aware that technique pedagogues are a different breed than rehearsal coaches. Eric is a technique trouble-shooter. A good trouble-shooter is a god-send. It is also true that Eric's training began at a community college in California, but it is rather ungenerous and misleading to ignore his graduate degree from the Institute of Russian Theater where he was mentored by non other than Mikhail Lavrovsky. He also taught very popular classes at the Bolshoi Academy and choreographed for dancers such as Ilya Kuznetsov. Those in-the-know do not overlook such credentials in such a facile manner -- or maybe that reviewer had not really watched the DVD to learn about Eric's credentials. If these Russian names mean nothing to a reviewer then perhaps that reviewer is not informed enough about Russian technique to critique Eric Conrad.

Furthermore, I find Eric's other DVD, Black Swan Fitness, very useful for teaching ""adult"" students with little or no experience in ballet. His floor-barre is accessible and does wonders for building strength, learning to initiate movement from correct positions, and sustaining correct placement through the movement.

I have no idea who or where Eric is but I am now very much dependent on his insights. After all, I don't speak Russian.",1360195200,7,3976,4.73015873015873
8509489,1,B0073W5UG2,"I am absolutely in agreement with everything the previous reviewer said. The oddity of Conrad's agenda is striking. The dichotomy he espouses regarding Russian vs American is not only rediculous, but also dangerous. I was trained by a Russian, a former principal with 25 years at the Kirov, a Vaganova trained, peoples artist of Russia. And ALL of that training occured in the US! Conrad's self-promotion seems to hinge on his espousal of uniqueness in that he is the ""only American to really understand Russian ballet training."" This is preposterous and intellectually reckless considering ballet's evolutionary continuance and its global nature as an art form. I am a former dancer and now I teach. I speak as a student, performer, instructor, and lover of ballet when I say, don't waste your money on this DVD.",1349827200,9,813,5.029629629629629
8509490,1,B0073W5UG2,"I am a former professional dancer and I've been dancing ballet for 24 years. I have also been teaching ballet for 5 years and I have trained with Royal Academy of Dance in their teaching credential program. I have spent many years learning various ballet methods, but my ""native"" style is Vaganova style, which I studied for about 15 years straight and have returned to because it's my personal favorite. I have been trained by plenty of Russians, one of my current mentors was a Principal dancer in the Kirov/Mariinsky ballet and the other was a Soloist in the Bolshoi ballet. I am no stranger to this style and many other Americans are quite familiar with it, as well. I'm not a special snowflake and neither is Eric. Many people in and out of Russia, and the US, have had similar opportunities to learn this method from professionals. That is a fact.

What Conrad teaches in his dvd and on youtube is no secret. It is common knowledge outside of Russia, in the hundreds of different Vaganova ballet schools and academies around the globe that are owned and taught by former professionals who have spent their entire lives dancing with the Vaganova method. The Vaganova method has been taught and practiced widely in the US for decades by people who know what they're doing. Not only that, but Eric has never been a performing dancer, himself and because of that, there is a wealth of experience that he is missing out on and cannot possibly share with students. The stage is a world that Eric is simply not experienced with, so his knowledge only goes so far.

In his attempts to get attention in the ballet world, Eric has created a controversy around himself by tearing people down. He has tried to create a divide between Russian ballet and American ballet when there is no reason to do so. He has stated many times that he thinks Americans are not only terrible ballet dancers, but they can't possibly understand ballet and it has no place in their culture or identity. These statements are not only offensive, but they are incorrect. He has no factual or logical basis for making comments on the state of American ballet because it is rather diverse, with a wide variety of quality available. Quality that he has not seen in his limited experiences as a student in American community college ballet classes, which are widely considered to be very low quality compared to most other ballet schools in the US. Making this comparison is the equivalent of getting angry that a kindergartner can't do linear algebra. He was in a ""kindergarten"" ballet class in the US and he completely ignores the fact that there are many wonderful pre-professional ballet programs in the US where the students are more than capable of ""linear algebra"" and they move on to develop successful careers.

His comments have slowly become more and more outlandish and unrealistic as time passes, showing his desperation to catch people's attention. His most recent faux pas was claiming that Natalia Osipova left the Bolshoi Ballet because David Hallberg joined and David is so poorly trained that Natalia was afraid to dance pas de deux with him. He is so deluded that he thinks he knows these people and their personal reasons for their career choices. He's also deluded if he thinks David has been poorly trained, since he is widely considered to be one of the best male ballet dancers in the world. Natalia clearly stated her reasons for leaving the Bolshoi and she performs with Hallberg regularly at ABT, so his story didn't make sense, anyway.

This is just the tip of the iceberg and he came back to the US with promises of training Americans and opening his own school in Burbank, CA. I have worked with several students who went to his studio during the few months it was actually open and according to them, the classes were rather small. Los Angeles is lacking in the ballet department, compared to other large American cities, but even LA had enough opportunities for students to receive excellent training in the Vaganova method at other locations. Why would a student learn from Eric when they can drive another 25 miles to receive training from a former Kirov principal? Now that his studio hasn't worked out, he has been blaming his lack of success on ""Americans who don't want to hear the truth about ballet and their poor American training"". The fact of the matter is that, in the US, ballet is not funded by the government. As a result, American training includes some of the best in the world and some of the worst, schools where only the top 0.5% are accepted and schools open to everyone, no matter the ability, age, etc. There is simply more variation, here, compared to Russia, where up until recently, the government funded everything. That resulted in less ballet schools that had to use stricter entrance standards, to make the most of their limited money. That is the real difference, nothing more. The US has plenty of schools that are just as good as the top schools in Russia. Unfortunately, the truth about Russia vs. the US is a lot more boring than Eric would like it to be.

I hope this sheds some light on this situation. If you would like to receive good ballet training, do research online and through word of mouth in your area/city and you will more than likely find a good school (and a few bad ones) near you. Attend those, go in person, the best way to learn ballet is by practice in front of someone who knows what they're doing and they can correct you as you go, so that you don't hurt yourself. There is no need to spend an arm and a leg buying a short dvd that tells you anything a decent ballet teacher could tell you in five minutes. This dvd is a waste of your time and money, you'll get much more out of a 1 hour ballet class.",1342569600,26,5760,4.62109375
8509491,5,B0073W5UG2,"This is a documentary about ballet technique.  It explains how to develop turnout thus developing proper placement of the body for ballet.  Any one interested in ballet technique should own this DVD and watch and learn and work and watch again and again.  Very few ballet teachers know how to train a dancer to develop turnout, most teachers believe either you are turned out or your not, WRONG!  This DVD gives you specific exercises which develop and train your body to turn out.  I highly recommend  watching the DVD in conjunction with the blogs posted on the American Cinematic Ballet YouTube Channel.  You will transform your ballet technique, you will educate yourself about ballet technique and you will dance like you never have before!  Thank you Eric Conrad for sharing your eight years of study in Russia!",1336435200,9,817,4.912408759124087
8509492,5,B0073W5UG2,"Eric Conrad has presented in this two disc set a discussion of ballet mechanics that most students probably have not been exposed to. What Eric shows is what a student should go through in thorough private instruction, but, as Eric points out, rarely does. Some viewers may find this process tedious, but that is what ballet is all about: attention to extremely minute detail. While this type of instruction may be encountered with a good teacher in private instruction, or fortunate rare class corrections(over the years, such corrections add up!), I don't think it is covered much by other DVDs.
An added feature to this set is that it is recorded with modern equipment with an aspect ratio of 16:9 so it will look good on your flat screen TV(with excellent image quality). The sound is also good quality stereo(the only problem with the sound is at times, when Eric turns on the studio music on CD, it comes through with saturation distortion for some reason; it may just be it was too loud for the recording equipment).
This set is highly recommended for all serious students of ballet(and related fields, such as gymnastics and ice skating) and is a valuable addition to ballet discography.",1317168000,6,1195,4.8341463414634145

8509494,1,B0073W5UG2,"There is some good advise in here, but the lack of editing and run on style of speaking - not to mention the endless repetition-  by Conrad makes it painful to sit through. Could have been condensed into 20 minutes and the best parts are available free in his podcasts on YouTube if you sift through all the drivel. Save your money.",1315008000,10,332,4.354838709677419
8509495,5,B0073W5UG2,"For those who want a visual explanation of Russian technique, this is the tape for you. The demonstrations and  explanations are excellent.
