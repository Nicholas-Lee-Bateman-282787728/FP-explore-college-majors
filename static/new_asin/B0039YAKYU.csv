I had heard all the opinions/rumors and a few one-sided interviews .. but this documentary actually has interviews with Gretzky, Janet Gretzky, Pocklington, Sather, and McNall .. so you get the 5 key sides of the story and can form your own opinion on one of the most important trades in sports history",1472342400,,316,4.660714285714286

8392492,5,B0039YAKYU,"If you're a sensitive ice-hockey lover, this documentary will bring a tear to your eye.  It's the sad story of the Great One's trade to the Kings after his magnificent tenure with the Oilers.  Your blood will boil at how managers wantonly use their players for money, and how a city like Los Angeles gets away with glamourizing and celebritizing things they know nothing about.  At the same time, you'll see how a player as great as Gretzky can make a hockey fan out of anyone, and that's probably a good thing. It makes you wonder how things would be different for Mr. Gretzky if he hadn't been traded in this manner. Good eye-opening documentary!",1330041600,2,648,4.6173913043478265
8392493,1,B0039YAKYU,"So far the weakest of the 30 for 30 series of documentary films. I think the film makes a huge mistake in interpretation that many journalists have done, also, over the years. The Wayne Gretzky trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings was not this great tragedy for Canadian hockey fans. Our Canadian hockey heroes had often played in the States (i.e., Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr played their entire careers in the U.S.). Sure, it was a shock to Oiler fans but the vast majority of real hockey fans love big trades and none was bigger than this at the time.

The Oilers also were not a well-loved team outside of Edmonton due to their brash owner Peter Pocklington, smug coach Glen Sather and the cocky attitude of their players (remember the singing on the bench when up 5-0 on LA in the Miracle on Manchester game that the Oilers lost 6-5 in OT and subsequently the series?). Most hockey fans I know loved the fact the Oilers would now be weaker and the other big thing was how cool the Kings new jerseys looked adopting the NFL Raiders colors. The Gretzky trade created great anticipation for the 1989/90 season.

The doc does cover most aspects of the trade and subsequent aftermath but why the director Peter Berg has to place himself in the movie and interview Gretzky on the golf course is beyond me. It just smacks of ""oh, look at me and how self-important I am to this film"" type of direction. Alfred Hitchcock did it best not Michael Moore. Make a distinctive cameo in your own films, if you like, then step back and let the story run its natural course.

Overall, a worthy subject but one that does not delve any deeper than the original newspaper, radio and TV reports back in 1989.",1314316800,,1708,4.485530546623794
8392494,5,B0039YAKYU,"This is a very insightfull documentary that details all the parties involved in the trade of The Great One to the L.A. Kings.  I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you are not a hockey fan.",1279756800,,195,4.27027027027027
8392495,5,B0039YAKYU,"Coming into this documentary, I knew of Wayne Gretzky and knew that he was great, but I didn't know of his story. Heck, I wasn't even a hockey fan, so imagine my surprise when I was glued to my seat during the story of one of the most compelling trades in sports history. Director Peter Burg just does a great job of using old footage mixed with various commentary including that of Gretzky's, and to my surprise again, Gretzky was quite open on his feelings about the trade now. Openly saying you could've had at least two more championships if you hadn't taken the trade? That takes guts.

The documentary was also very compelling on the side of reaction, and the management's end of the trade. The documentary was fair on all sides, and I still came away (knowing nothing of the events beforehand, mind you) thinking Pocklington was an idiot. And then I found the reaction from the city of Edmonton just stunning. It's very rare you see a city hold so much of a place in their heart for one guy, then simply riot against the guy who let him go. I mean, they burnt statues of Pocklington in the parking lot.

Overall, if you're a hockey fan, a fan of Gretzky, or just a sports fan in general, then you should find much love in your heart for ""King's Ransom."" It gave me insight into a subject I knew nothing about, and it was well-done and compelling in the process. So props to Peter Burg, and forever props to the great Wayne Gretzky.",1268524800,8,1438,4.402255639097745
