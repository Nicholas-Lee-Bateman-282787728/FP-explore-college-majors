5554515,1,B00B3P3D1E,My monster truck loving 6 year old (who has watched the a documentary on Big Foot at least 20 times) was so excited when he opened this gift and super bored after a few minute.  The background music was very monotonous.  He has never tried to watch it since that first time - feel like I wasted money on this.,1385251200,,309,4.133333333333334
5554516,5,B00B3P3D1E,"I have an 8 year old with autism and he absolutely loves these videos because they are real-life, not animated.  They are so realistic with all of the sights and sounds that he gets totally absorbed.  There is not a ridiculous amount of narration as in some others we own, so you really get to hear the sounds of life with those trucks.  Highly recommend!",1382486400,2,355,4.430769230769231

5554519,1,B00B3P3D1E,I purchased one of these and it skips through the whole movie (tried on 2 seperate players). It won't even play in my portable DVD player AT ALL. Soooo .. amazon sent me a replacement and assured me it would work. WELL GUESS WHAT ?? THE REPLACEMENT WAS DEFECTIVE TOO! DONT BUY. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.,1375833600,,303,4.333333333333333

5554531,5,B00B3P3D1E,Great for traveling with a  great grandson on a long trip to Florida,1411603200,,68,4.230769230769231
5554532,2,B00B3P3D1E,This DVD is comprised of really bad shots of trucks which may or may not be monster trucks.  My grandsons are crazy about Monster trucks but they will not watch these DVD's.  It looks like they taped off of a TV set or hid a camera at events or used a bad cell phone.,1409097600,,267,3.925925925925926
5554533,5,B00B3P3D1E,I think it is cool but if the monster jam world finals DVDs came with posters that will be Asome,1407888000,,96,3.85
5554534,2,B00B3P3D1E,"Personally I find this DVD set boring which is why I have it two stars. There is no narration, only music and random monster truck stunts/crashes spliced together.  My 6 year old son would give it 5 stars though. He watches it over and over again!",1400198400,,247,4.369565217391305
5554535,2,B00B3P3D1E,"I expected a complete monster truck show, not small clips. Missed the engine sounds instead I got lousy music. To see Old clips put together instead of new up to date disapointed my son a lot.",1399161600,,192,4.361111111111111
5554536,5,B00B3P3D1E,My 2 grandsons absolutely love this! It is all they want to watch so Grandma is getting pretty tired of it but I let them watch it and I just do something else.,1396828800,,160,3.878787878787879
5554537,5,B00B3P3D1E,"My 3 year old, who is obsessed with Monster trucks, really loved receiving this for Christmas. He watched the DVDs all the way to his grandparent's house & back (8 hour trip one way). It was a great video for any child that enjoys watching monster trucks.",1394409600,,255,4.446808510638298
5554538,3,B00B3P3D1E,My 6 year old who loves monster trucks did not really care for the video.  i guess it is just monster trucks going in circles and jumping.  Not sure they do anything else!  My son enjoys listening to explanations and how things work.  This movie is better suited for maybe younger or less inquisitive kids.  Never received movie!,1393459200,,329,4.603448275862069
5554539,4,B00B3P3D1E,"I received this Monster Truck DVD set of 2 plus poster the other day.  This is part of my grandson's birthday present.  I am curious though because there is no mention of a poster which I thought was odd.  I am hoping that someone can tell me if there is actually a poster inside of the DVD case?  It is sealed and I do not want to open it, as it is a future birthday present.  Thank you!",1391385600,,388,3.923076923076923
5554540,1,B00B3P3D1E,The movie is great but my soon hated how the music played in the background the entire time the movie played. He expected to hear the trucks in the movie. Bad buy if you want to hear the truck sounds.,1390953600,,200,4.025
5554541,5,B00B3P3D1E,"I bought this for my almost 3 year old Grandson and he was mesmerized! especially with the fire-breathing, car eating dinosaur.  We have watched them many times.",1390780800,,161,4.962962962962963

5554543,5,B00B3P3D1E,"Bought this for my monster truck obsessed 3 year old.  He requests to watch it every day.  Going on 3 months straight now.  Would strongly recommend.  It looks like they make other ones too (trains, plains etc).",1387929600,,211,4.621621621621622
5554544,5,B00B3P3D1E,my 3 year old would ask every day to play it for him. loves the poster(although it is smaller than i thaught it would Be)but a good way to keep boys entertained,1386028800,,160,4.03125

8562150,2,B00B3P3D1E,My son and I love monster jam and this was a COMPLETE let down!! Not to mention I didn't get the free poster for him. They were good and gave me 1/2 the money back but it was still a WASTE of $10.00,1458691200,,198,3.627906976744186
8562151,5,B00B3P3D1E,Guaranteed to entertain your kid long enough to at least grab a shower!  After that the roaring gets somewhat hard to listen to over and over again.  Suggest also purchasing Advil or Aleve with this DVD set.  Or perhaps wine.,1452729600,2,225,4.575
