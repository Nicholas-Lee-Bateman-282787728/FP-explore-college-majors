5374321,3,B009ZNTX38,"Speaking as someone who ordered the complete series collection I can say that this third season set is, in terms of picture quality, about the same as season two. The exception is with the ""Video Games"" episode. At the very beginning while the two actors are talking a small distracting white speck appears on the left side of the screen, jittering for about a minute-and-a-half. The major blunder with this season concerns ""The Mystery of Manon"" 2-parter. VEI have somehow mixed up the order of these two episodes so that part 2 appears before part 1, and like I said in my review for the complete collection, this might not be that big of a problem if these two episodes appeared on the same disc, but they don't, (even though it indicates on the discs themselves that the episodes are in the correct order). What a pain in the butt, especially for first-time viewers. I did email the company and let them know of this mistake and hopefully they will have fixed it by the time season three is released individually.

Notable guest stars this season include Telly Savalas, William Atherton, Vincent D'Onofrio, John Heard, Michael Moriarty, Robert Mitchum, Frances Fisher, J.T. Walsh, Chris Cooper, Amanda Plummer, Jerry O'Connell, Frank Whaley, Michael Rooker, and Macaulay Culkin.",1412208000,25,1282,4.935185185185185

5374323,5,B009ZNTX38,"I wrote a rating before for this show, And I've decided to change it. I've always liked the show.  The price before of $38 for this season seemed a bit high. Well I bought it at Walmart the other day for $15, Which was much better. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't have a problem with the cursor on discs 1, 2, or any of the other discs.  And I tried them in my Blu-ray player and in two different Dvd players I own.",1411776000,13,415,3.9879518072289155
5374324,3,B009ZNTX38,"Season 3 was better than I remembered it. And they worked around Robert Woodward's heart attack in a well written way.  The downside is the actual DVDs, The 5th disc is scratched up in such a way that I miss about a minute of the second episode.  And one of the episodes won't play on disc four from the main menu.  You have to go to play all and skip to the Mystery of Manon part 1 and rewind from there to the Equalizer title to play the episode that does not play from the main menu.  The Equalizer season 3 gets 4.5 stars, the mediocre work by Vei on the DVD work and the people working for the distributer of the DVDs scratching up what is advertised as new I would rate as a 1.5,  However I am not returning this, most of the annoyances can be worked around.  And I played it on a PS4 if that makes a difference.",1468627200,,818,4.018518518518518

5374334,5,B009ZNTX38,I have really enjoyed the dvd The Equalizer Season 3.  I remember when the show was on the air and on USA on cable.  This dvd brings back a lot of happy memories for me.  I am planning on buying the other 3 seasons of the Equalizer show.,1443571200,,237,3.8958333333333335

5374344,5,B009ZNTX38,"As a collector of some older TV dramas, I can recommend the Equalizer series ...  It's a little different than some of the newer dramas ....  I recall when the Cold War was declared over and done and that KGB stories would be irrelevant ... but suddenly, the Russians are again up to their old tricks ... and the series such as The Equalizer once again seems relevant!!  We love owning this as well as the other three Equalizers in the series!",1433980800,,443,4.378048780487805

5374346,2,B009ZNTX38,"The first season was much better.  This season does not seem as polished and frankly the son is very irritating (plus the actor seems not very good).  Edward Woodward is a great actor but does not seem so here; thus I think it is the directing and the script writing.

I really like the premise but the memories of this show far exceed what I view now; I guess I got more sophisticated or more picky.",1431216000,,400,4.2368421052631575
5374347,4,B009ZNTX38,"This season was rather mixed compared to One and Two. Edward Woodward had heart problems during the season and was sidelined for a big part of it. They brought it Robert Mitchum to replace him for two shows, and Richard Jordan to support him for ten. Then they both disappear. I like both actors, but they both just suddenly appear and then vanish. I think I would have preferred it if they relied more on reoccurring characters like Mickey and Jimmy, but suddenly they were both sidelined. Also, a few of the shows do not seem to be up to the usual quality, but a few were really spectacular. The quality is inconsistent, but over all it was still an entertaining show.",1428883200,,670,4.5

5374352,3,B009ZNTX38,"Early in this season, Edward Woodward suffered a heart attack (fortunately non-fatal), and they had to change the show to rely more on secondary characters while he recovered.  The result was less successful than the first two seasons.",1425254400,,235,5.184210526315789

5374358,5,B009ZNTX38,I absolutely loved watching these shows again. They were very entertaining and without all the profuse profanity you see in action shows today. Glad to own the entire show on DVD.,1422489600,,179,4.806451612903226

5374360,5,B009ZNTX38,"Stars are for the show... not the DVDs.  Several of the discs will not play.  This is not the same issue discussed in  other comments about the lack of a ""cursor"" on the menu page of the discs: these discs simply will not load at all.  You may be able to play them through the DVD drive on certain computers or a laptop.  Amazon replaced immediately and with ZERO fuss... but it seems wrong that Amazon should be undertaking shipping, etc. for replacement.  The quality control of VEI is not good, and they have not responded to my inquiry.

On the positive side: the order of episodes discussed by other posters has been corrected: you will be able to tell since the packaging is slightly different (the outer paper slipcase has been eliminated, and, the packages will likely have a different shrink wrap indicating they have been opened).",1421625600,,840,4.635135135135135

5374362,5,B009ZNTX38,"They say you can't go back in time but you can............with this DVD set and a dark room.  It instantly transports you to the bleek, graffiti ridden NYC of the mid 1980's.  Granted the quality isn't perfect but it isn't expected to be with a series this old.  VEI has done a respectable job with it regardless.  I had absolutely none of the navigation disc issues described in the negative reviews......mine works perfectly and you can go to each and every episode.

You can watch the first episode on the tv and the rest on those discs on your computer. Even with the flub ups on this, I still enjoyed watching this and season 2. I will  buy season 4 because I've waited for so many years and never thought I would see again. I have the old vhs episodes of season 1 which I would still play because I missed seeing Mr Woodward for years. This was the best TV show there ever was and I would look forward to seeing it every week. I think it was on CBS on Wed night.

There is no highlight on the main menu. This is the little on-screen graphic you move around with your remote control to select Play or other options. Without it, the disc will be stuck on the main menu and you won't be able to actually play any episodes.
