7342622,4,B0124KXVD6,"I was very happy to finally receive my copy. I've been waiting for this to be released, since my friend passed. I bought it to see him again & as a cautionary tale for my eldest daughter. We both smiled, cringed,  laughed and cried. At the end I asked what she took away from it. She got the message loud and clear. There isn't much I can say that won't be simply regurgitating other words that have been used in prior reviews. I'm just really glad that being around those types of antics have long been in my rear view mirror.",1449532800,3,527,4.217821782178218
7342623,4,B0124KXVD6,"Is music a lifeboat or a death trap?  Is it the soul of a community, or the cause of its demise?  These are the overarching themes in this documentary chronicling over two years in the life of southern punk band The Dirty Works.  Based in the Bible belt, The Dirty Works, led by self-harming, methadone addict singer Christopher Scum are a white trash outcry against the conservative values that surround them.  These four hard drinking, hard living men take the stage and Scum, with a set of brass knuckles taped to his microphone, beats himself bloody as he staggers about the stage as if caught up in a seizure.  The outcome is a lot like G. G. Allin fronting Nashville Pussy.  If that interests you, read on.
While the entire band is included in this film, Scum is definitely the focal point.  Guitarist Steven Crime, a functional alcoholic, shares his views on the rise of The Dirty Words, as does drummer Bernard, the only member to seem to live a normal adult life.  As the film opens with Scum setting his hair on fire in a hotel room, it becomes clear that his is the personality which will garner the most camera time.  Christopher Scum is, in many ways, a white trash stereotype.  He is both mentally and emotionally unstable, and both looks and speaks like someone who has suffered a traumatic head injury (which he has).  He alternately sings about atheism and drinkin beer and shootin drugs with Jesus.  Through the course of Rebel Scum his life goes downhill into alcoholism, shooting morphine, and depression.
As Scum spirals out of control the rest of the band struggles to keep the enterprise moving forward.  Bernard attempts to step in to manage the band, only to arouse Scums paranoia.  Bassist Shaggy leaves to join another band.  At one point The Dirty Works implodes, leaving Scum on the brink of self-destruction.  Holed up in a hotel room due to domestic violence and keeping himself continually intoxicated, the film crew has to remove Scum from the hotel as the management has called the police due to the chaos he has caused.  In the end, armed with a new bassist, Scum manages to rise from his funk to get The Dirty Works back on the road.  In this case, music is probably the only thing that saves him from an early grave.
Around all the drama revolving about Scum are tales of Crimes constant alcoholism, tense times in studios, and a lot of shows with few in attendance.  While the world around The Dirty Works seems to feel that The Dirty Works are an example of the very lowest of southern culture, its hard to feel that these four misfits would still be alive if not for their dedication to the band.  Each one is on a path of self-destruction to a varying extent, with Scum being the most blatant in his disregard for even his own well-being.  In that sense, Rebel Scum is an interesting tale, as it shows how a group of rebels, shunned by all but their own, find community and purpose that keeps them striving for something more than the day to day life of an addict.",1449014400,3,3005,4.558659217877095
7342624,4,B0124KXVD6,"I rewatched this movie again tonight and it had a profound and depressing effect on me.
I am Christopher Scum and as the movie points out I had trouble with severe depression, severe almost debilitating anxiety, a panic disorder and an addiction problem I was controlling with Methadone Maintenance during movie.
  June 27th, 2015, 5 months ago yesterday we were coming back from a Myrtle Beach vacation when we we knocked from behind into the medium by a tanker hauling gasoline. My soul mate you'll meet in this movie was killed in the worst way as I tried to get her out of burning car. I got 2nd and 3rd degree burns well over 30 % of my body.
  Renee being on Methadone was heavy for the ONLY time in her life, for this and other reasons she wasn't a fan of her parts of the Documentary. I am I think it shows the band progress a lot until a year after filming was finished many people dubbed best us Punk Rock band in Knoxville.
  If you're ready for a ride with a true White Trash Psycho Rock band this is the movie for you. If ya like fist Fights, total rebellion and refusal to conform, titties, and all around good filthy fun this is the movie for you!
  Here is a Knoxville Showing a few years back, if you'll notice my Punk Rock Princess has lost the weight and is as beautiful as ever. She never stopped being beautiful and I'm just here, waiting to see what happens next.

7342625,4,B0124KXVD6,"""Rebel Scum"" takes us through two year of the Knoxville Punk scene. The Dirty Works bounces in and out of the Tennessee state capitol, while playing music that would make GG Allin proud. Not everybody in the scene is clean, as addiction and mental dysfunction tend to spur music and ruin lives. If you want struggle, you get to feel the struggle throughout every step of their journey.

The film focuses on the frontman Christopher Scum almost to the detriment of the other band members. They talk about the music and how Knoxville feeds their sound. But, Scum demands so much focus with his issues. A lot of fellow viewers wanted to compare it to Anvil, but that wasn't fair. Anvil almost seems fake compared to this release.

The DVD comes with a music video, footage from the Atlanta premiere, NPR coverage, a featurette and trailers as the special features. The A/V Quality is standard for music documentaries. Since it seems like it wasn't released a feature, I'm not stunned to see it not look amazing. But, I appreciate a degree of grit in these kinds of shows. In the end, I'd recommend a purchase.",1447632000,4,1106,4.666666666666667
7342626,3,B0124KXVD6,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Punk music is not for everyone. Let me clarify. SOME punk music is not for everyone. For myself Ive grown fond of a number of bands classified as punk from the Clash to the Ramones. But the real down and dirt hardcore punk music is something Ive not been a fan of. It still deserves recognition as a driving force that resulted in numerous bands who went on to more lucrative rock music careers. Those in the scene recognize that they're treated like the bastard child but rather than get angry about that tagline they embrace it.

When I had the opportunity to watch and write about a documentary called REBEL SCUM that concerned the life and times over a two year period of a punk rocker from Knoxville, TN, I had to take that chance. Having enjoyed SALAD DAYS which covered the punk scene in Washington, D.C., I wanted to expand my world appreciation of punk music. I had no idea what I was getting into.

The movie, as I said, looks at a two year period in the life of Christopher Scum, the lead singer and driving force behind the band The Dirty Works. Scum considers himself a full-fledged member of those known as white trash, living hand to mouth in an area known as the Bible belt because of the strong religious ties the communities have in the area. Not a place where someone who doesnt necessarily believe and who has lyrics that most would associate with blasphemy would want to live. But he does so along with his girlfriend Renee.

Scum is a self-confessed drug addict but as the movie begins he is in the middle of rehab with the help of a local methadone clinic. Each of his band mates have problems of their own as well, in particular Steven Crime the bands lead guitarist. Crime is an extreme alcoholic who goes off on rants throughout the film as well as violent outbursts. Crime and Scum are depicted here as having the worst problems. While Crime has alcohol to contend with Scum deals with serious issues of depression as well as his substance problems. Watching them in this film one can only feel a deep amount of compassion for both and a desire to see them overcome these issues. But this is reality and not a feature film and by the end of the film hope for both seems distant at best.

The movie is an eye opening experience of the mindset behind this sort of music. Fueled by his inner demons Scum takes to the stage putting everything he has into every performance doing everything from busting his head open with his microphone to smashing his body to the floor. The fan base for the band is slim but those who come to his shows never walk away without a story to tell. Is that a good thing or a bad one? Each person watching will have to come to their own conclusions on that decision.

For myself I found it a sad story, one that begins with hope and ends miserably. This is not a story that is being told but a documentary displaying the band, the man and the life he leads. Its not pretty and its not supposed to be. What the film makers here do, and you can tell they are fans as well as film makers, is to put the ugly truth out there for all to see. Their goal is not to sugar coat anything. They might be concerned about the welfare of their subject matter at time but not to the point that they set up interventions or interfere with what is going on. For me that makes it a better documentary than most being made these days where situations are set up rather than incidents simply being filmed.

By the end of the film you won't be left untouched. Some will be angry and think that anyone who does this to themselves should just be ignored. Others will cheer the antics of Scum and his band while ignoring the inner turmoil and pain he goes through on a daily basis. And some will walk away hoping that his life changes and turns around for the better, that help is on the way in whatever form it may take. Rather than condemn the man for a life that he seems unable to control it would seem that compassion is the better route to take when considering his predicament. As the credits roll you can only hope that he finds a way to control those inner demons before he follows in the tracks of punk icons like G.G. Allin who died of a heroin overdose.

This is not an easy film to watch. It is as raw as you would expect given the subject matter. It is interesting but difficult to watch. Go in knowing what to expect.",1456876800,4,4416,4.312048192771084

7342631,5,B0124KXVD6,"In an age where reality television rules many popular networks and America seems to be hooked on everything from scripted drama between supposed total strangers living in a house together to the plastic dialogue & tame escapades of wealthy housewives to who can bake the most impressive cake...Rebel Scum, if brought to the mainstream, would likely come as an adrenaline shot to the heart of this zombie like, easily entertained, complacent TV watching nation. It's compelling, exciting, shocking, funny, sad, street level, & at times grotesque, but most importantly...It's real. There's nothing prepared or scripted here. Christopher Scum is as spontaneous as they come throughout this documentary. You never know what he's about to do next, but after the opening scene, you'll be waiting for it. This movie dives head first into his addictions to heroin, alcohol, & methadone as well as some apparent social & mental struggles. There are heartbreaking moments. It's hard to look away. You'll also see alcohol fueled rants and rages from the band's guitar player, Crime, as he deals with his own booze dependencies. As the band hits the road, there's some good and very realistic live footage of this southern punk quartet playing in various locations and dives around the southeast that are not at all sensationalized for the film. I'm a musician myself and I can say that this is a very accurate representation of traveling gigs when you're an underground, unsigned band trying to get your name out there...a lot of small crowds & very little money. These outrageous punk rockers are trying to break through in an area of the country that largely doesn't understand and sometimes rejects their kind...the Bible Belt of the deep South. But The Dirty Works still deliver as if they're playing to packed halls. Christopher Scum is dangerously (mostly to himself) entertaining, no matter what circumstances or atmospheres surround him. This is a great watch without a boring moment. I'm looking forward to turning some friends onto it. In closure, I'll say that I can only hope Netflix picks this up so the mainstream can be introduced to what reality entertainment really is...the good, the bad, and the gritty grimy ugly.",1452988800,4,2222,5.090410958904109

As for those who do not know the subjects of the documentary personally, you will still enjoy this film.  It is a peek into a lifestyle not many of us experience. Not sure that many would want to experience, as there is certainly a lot of pain behind the chaos.",1450569600,3,506,4.206185567010309

This movie grabbed me immediately and held my interest for the entire time. Honestly it could have been 2 or 3 times longer. Within the last 3 months or so, I've probably watched this movie no less than 6 times. The Dirty Works have a new fan. The music is straight up rock and roll, and you couldn't ask for a cooler bunch of dudes. If i'm in a bad mood, this has been my go to movie to get me back to rockin and rollin. Do yourself a favor, order multiple copies this holiday season. They are great stocking stuffers. My mother and grandmother were just delighted with the copies they received last Christmas.

8725341,4,B0124KXVD6,"This was a very entertaining video about the trials and tribulations of a punk rock band formed in Knoxville, TN. As a musician, I found it compelling as it delved into the inner workings of the band ""Dirty Works.""  Fellow musicians should watch this film if for no other reason than to see the dangers of the rock 'n roll lifestyle and how it can destroy your life- not the music, but the trappings of drugs and alcohol and how they always lead a person into their own private hell.  Still, one can appreciate the honesty of this band and its' members.  A very intriguing and emotionally intense video. Well worth watching.

After seeing Rebel Scum, I don't feel like my collection would be complete without it! I've watched this thing from start to finish several times. It's very well put together, and keeps you interested the whole time. You really get a unique look inside the lives and music of The Dirty Works, and their lead singer Christopher Scum. They're a southern punk band from Knoxville TN that make their own rules. They don't try to fit in, and for better or worse, they are living their lives exactly how they want. I didn't know anything about The Dirty Works or Christopher Scum before watching Rebel Scum. I'd say I'm a fan now. -Mark",1464220800,2,752,4.5777777777777775

8725346,5,B0124KXVD6,"Was so glad to receive my copy of Rebel Scum. I have to put it at the top of my list when it comes to all documentaries done on musical artists and the hardships that most do not consider come about when in a band- just trying to be expressive in the stifled areas of the country where different isn't seen as just creative nor viewed as actual art but ' 'too much unlike everyone else''. I am very close to Knoxville TN and can definitely vouch for the fact that this is that one rare, hardcore and raw down to the bone marrow, real life no holds barred music doc for you if you've just never fully been able to connect with the others out there that honestly seem to have a lot that is missing ( if you're honest with yourself you do know there have been several of them that are like that ) then Rebel Scum is that one rare gem for you that many ppl likely thought never would exist. It does & I rarely recommend anything on Amazon or do reviews. As the many reviews have made clear before this one/plus long said it best- If you want no filler no fake and all real no matter how shocking, or how near unbelievable, or how you connect with the main folks in the doc and relate to them it is still their truth and the truths of so many out there who just don't hold back when it comes to being true to oneself. Alot is and can be learned from this one vs the other music docs that fall short a bit no matter how devoted we are as fans- rest assured Rebel Scum will refuse to go easy on the reality. No use requesting a lighter dosage or a little less honesty about the struggles faced as individuals and as a music group in areas where anything if not agreed with by the masses is to be looked down on & stifled without putting up a fight. You won't regret this doc. Christopher Scum is truly amazing and you'll feel that you truly get to know each of the characters because I admire how none of them held back their talent nor their true selves due to this film. RIP <3 RB- I wish we had gotten to really know one another as friends- you'll never be forgotten & are forever loved. Amazing film- I put it far above Last Days Here and that says a lot. No hold back in this one. :) lol sometimes you may hope that there is but it's real life and it's a life that many live or have lived. Can't stress it enough. Dont miss out on this and then don't hesitate to check out the songs by the band and any of the acoustic/selfmade albums by Scum himself. They are beautiful in many ways. You'll find yourself shocked at such talent shining through each song after getting to know CScum just from RSdoc only. Get it!",1460592000,2,2610,4.099609375
