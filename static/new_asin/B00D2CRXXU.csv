8588543,5,B00D2CRXXU,"I really enjoyed Akwantu: The Journey.  I felt that is was a wonderful story.  I enjoyed listening to all of the Africans who were Maroons.  I know Mr. Anderson must be proud to be a be a Maroon after learning that he come from a family of warriors.  He is working on a second domcumentary about Queen Nanny.  It is so funny, many years I traveled to Jamaica.  I purchased a mug with an African woman on front of the mug.  It is a 500.00 dollar Jamaican bill.  It turns out that it is Queen Nanny.  I have never used the mug but, it made me proud to not only learn about Queen Nanny but, to also have her in my home.",1391299200,,616,3.9836065573770494

8588545,5,B00D2CRXXU,"My father's stories about his Maroon ancestors were always intriguing. The sparkle in his eyes, the smile on his face, and the immense pride that protruded through the veins in his forehead are unforgettable. I was born in Kingston, but spent many weekends and holidays in Portland.

I was a curious child, and would often wonder off into the hills. I was fascinated by the John Crow Mountains and the Blue Mountains that surrounded the village of Skibo. ""Do not go up to that hill. That is the sacred Maroon ground,"" they would say.

Fast forward to October 26, 2013. I sat in the auditorium at Medgar Evers College and watched Akwantu:the Journey. This film is about my Maroon ancestors. I cannot count the number of times that my body trembled as the spiritual connection ran through my body like an electrical charge. An epiphany, an awakening, an evening that I will forever cherish. Meeting the producer, Roy T. Anderson and his wife, Mrs. Alison G. Anderson, felt like a family reunion.

You do not have to be a Maroon to appreciate and connect with this film. The battles with the British and how it influenced other freedom fighters all over the world underscore the struggles against injustice. The preservation of the culture, the altruism of the Maroons, and the historically low crime rate in the Maroon towns will resonate with people all over the world.

Akwantu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1382832000,,1391,4.856540084388186
