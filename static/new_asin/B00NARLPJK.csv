8676985,4,B00NARLPJK,"It's Great that someone took the time to make this film & give credit to where credit is due, the women in horror is really what makes it so fun, not just the stars & the scream Queens but taking your girl to the movies & having her grab you when she is scared, women are really what make horror fun. This is a great in depth documentary covering many careers of the women in horror & is a must buy for all horror fans, I know i got mine now get yours!",1428883200,,452,3.870967741935484

A Reyna Young /John Gillette flick.

Stars: Lynn Lowry,Bianca Barnett,Christa Campbell,Sarah French,Adrienne King,Brooke Lewis,Seregon ODassey,and many others who were very well heard & seen.

In my collection is Shock Cinema 1-4 from Brinke Stevens & JR Bookwalter and thought that was the definitive showcase of Scream Queens for ever,But,Then Something To Scream About came out and we added that to our Women In Horror archives of dvd.

So,this year WWMM is releasing WELCOME TO MY DARKSIDE,and Reyna and her SQ bffs show  us What is going on in FILMS  now and how the show business of being a woman who likes horror,whether its creating it with a feminine angle or just being IN FRONT of the cameras and informing the males with cameras and scripts,That times they are changing For the good of all.",1410134400,4,881,5.488888888888889
