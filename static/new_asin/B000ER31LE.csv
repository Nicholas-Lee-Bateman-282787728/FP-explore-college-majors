2530527,5,B000ER31LE,"I saw this movie at a relative's house in Sweden and loved it.  Very funny and fantastic music.  Wonderful to see northern Sweden and a choir develop like that.  Nominated for the foreign language film Oscar a year ago or so.  Whenever it becomes available in the US, getting it.  Worth seeing.  Transfer this film to US format fast!",1143072000,21,333,4.559322033898305
2530528,5,B000ER31LE,"I saw this movie in the theatre while I was studying abroad in Sweden and loved it.  To be honest, I enjoyed this a lot more than any of the other oscar-nominated foreign films for 2005.

The story, while sometimes predictable and lacking complexity, is moving, touching and deeply personal.  I also thought that it gave an accurate portrayal of everyday life in the cold regions of Northern Scandinavia.

The story centers around a famous Swedish composer who has become obscessed with his work to the point of physical breakdown.  He is forced to leave his work and move back to the small village in northern Sweden where he grew up.  When he arrives, you begin to meet and fall in love with all the wonderful people - well not all of them are so wonderful.  The composer goes on to become the leader of the local church chior and uses his music to help lead some of the members through some troubeling experiences.  I won't give anything away but you really need to see this movie.

Also, you should listen to the soundtrack.  There are several very moving numbers - especially ""Gabriellas sng"", which is the theme song for the film.",1120176000,17,1136,4.579207920792079

2530532,3,B000ER31LE,"""Romantic and funny"" it says on the cover. Believe me it's not. The idea was fine - about a famous conductor who has a serious health crisis and breakdown, who goes back to his childhood village to live. He takes on responsibility for the local church choir and makes them excel. A nice idea, done elsewhere too. But the trouble with this Swedish movie is that it is very slow moving and far, far too long, with too many extraneous scenes. Yes, it has ""feel good"" elements, especially the growing enthusiasm and success of the choir itself, but the film also deals with the unfortunate family lives of some choir members and locals in too much detail. Many scenes could have been eliminated or reduced in length. In the end I found it a chore to get through and even the (surprise) ending was typically European, with [spoiler alert] the conductor dying in a bloody mess amidst the triumph of the choir at a major concert competition.  If the US had made this movie, no doubt it would have ended on a more positive and uplifting note - as in Mr Holland's Opus. Don't get me wrong. As a drama, it's not bad. It does have some humorous elements and a semi romance, but, overall, I felt emotionally drained and not uplifted.  I guess I feel misled by the cover. As I said, the main problem was its excessive and tedious length. On a more positive note, most of the actors were excellent and the cinematography, scenery and music beautiful.",1471564800,,1436,4.519230769230769

2530552,5,B000ER31LE,"AS IT IS IN HEAVEN (2004) is a color film, mostly taking place in a country village in Sweden. The first few minutes take place in a metropolitan concert hall in a big city, and the final few minutes take place in a concert hall in Austria. This is one of the 20 most intelligent and enjoyable movies that I have seen in the past 40 years. I cannot praise this movie enough. Most of the characters have major parts. The most important theme, is that of hope and working hard to improve one's lot, despite adversity (this is the same theme in most sports movies, right? Except that this is a church choir movie). In this church choir movie, adversity takes the form of repeated criminal bullying behaviors by the husband of church choir member Marie Sjoholm, adversity taking the form of witch hunts conducted by the minister Niklas Falk in collaboration with one of the choir members. Also, the adversity takes the form of repeated interruptions -- interrupts from the coffeepot, interruptions from the telephone, trivial interruptions, physically dangerous interruptions, there are so many interruptions that threaten the choir practice, that it makes this movie like a comedy. I will only reveal one feature of the ending: despite the adversity, the church choir becomes better and better and more popular. It is UNSTOPPABLE, as a result of the leadership from Michael Nyquist.

AS IT IS IN HEAVEN is an ensemble piece, where the viewer can enjoy the ongoing development relationships involving a half dozen members of a church choir, the minister of the town church, and a retired conductor. The conductor is played by Michael Nyquist, who has acted in some 50 movies. He plays a successful middle aged conductor, who had a mild heart attack, which persuaded him to retire from the stage. He decided to seek his roots, and to move to a country village, and to purchase an abandoned schoolhouse in which to live.

SIMILARITY IN THEMES WITH THOSE OF OTHER FILMS. The viewer will likely immediately think of MY LIFE AS A DOG (1985), directed by Lasse Hallstrom, because it is a Swedish film about home-spun happenings. Also, the viewer will think of WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, because of its portrayal of a retarded boy (Andre Sjoberg plays a retarded boy.). Andre Sjoberg is invited to join the choir (Michael Nyquist seems not to mind), and an interesting episode in this movie occurs when Andre Sjoberg is subjected to stress from the bickering of other people, and Andre Sjoberg goes potty in his pants. Another choir member shows tolerance and kindness, by cleaning up Sjoberg in the bathroom in the church. Yet another similar movie is ANOTHER EARTH (2011), starring Tom Cruise's brother William Mapother, and hot chick Brit Marling. What is similar is that William Mapother plays a middle aged intellectual who has a developing affair with the hot chick. In AS IT IS IN HEAVEN, the intellectual (Michael Nyquist, former orchestral conductor) has a developing affair with the hot chick (the choir member Fida Hallgren). But in both movies, the developing love affair comes to a sudden end.

CONNY THE BULLY. It is his own former schoolhouse, where he lived until the age of 15. The movie starts out with a type of flashback, showing Michael Nyquist as a child, and being bullied by Conny. A recurring theme in this movie, is that adult Conny (played by Per-Arne Morberg) is a successful truck driver who beats his wife and is insanely jealous of his wife's participation in the church choir. The wife is played by Marie Sjoholm, who in real life is a successful singer and recording artist. Throughout the movie, we see Conny having temper tantrums, and Marie Sjoholm has bruised cheeks now and then, from being beaten by Conny. An interesting dramatic moment, in this movie, occurs when Conny, in one of his temper tantrums, drives his huge truck into Marie Sjoholm's old automobile, and smashes into it, shoving it a dozen feet over the church lawn.

HOLLYWOOD's DEPICTION OF CHRISTIANITY. I am under the impression that Hollywood has a traditional agenda of portraying Christianity as an evil sect. Well, maybe Christianity does have some qualities of an evil sect, and perhaps it does not. At any rate, this movie from Sweden provides an admirably intelligent portrayal of the evil characteristics of Christianity. This occurs by way of interactions between Niklas Falk and his wife, Ingela Olsson. In a nutshell, Ingela Olsson correctly perceives that the business model of the Christian ministry is: STEP ONE: To persuade their congregation that people in their community or depraved and immoral, and STEP TWO: To persuade the congregation that the minister is providing a useful service to the community by getting rid of the immoral people. This is a self-perpetuating business model, and this fact is admirably articulated by Ingela Olsson. Ingela Olsson becomes progressively disgusted by the witch hunting behavior of her husband (Niklas Falk) and she finally leaves him. An intriguing bit of drama occurs, where Niklas Falk invites Michael Nyquist (choir director) into his home, and points a gun at Michael Nyquist, and threatens to kill Nyquist. Then, the minister has some sort of mental breakdown, and Nyquist is not killed.",1431907200,,5248,4.953461975028377

2530556,5,B000ER31LE,"The movie opens with flashes of Daniel's childhood intermingled with his health crisis that forces him to give up his brilliant musical career as a conductor. The opening scenes cause the audience to wonder just why Daniel would choose to move back to his hometown, he is not even sure as to his motives. And he remains unsure of them until the very end when he discovers via a seeming flash of insight just what has occurred, that his dream has been realized in a manner that exceeds his wildest dreams and without his diligent striving to achieve it. What I found most moving about this film was that the love or care that developed and was being nurtured in the relationships of the choir provided Daniel and numerous other members with such loving support that they were able to confront debilitating fears and inadequacies. This happen in a very spontaneous manner, as though love drew out of them the necessary actions to conquer these personal fears, leaving them, their peers and the audience surprised. And these situations increased their bonds, providing all of them with great encouragement. I think that Daniel realized that he had wrongly believed that the music could bring the transforming joy, but that the love they had for one another had brought all the goodness about.",1425686400,,1289,4.83710407239819

2530587,5,B000ER31LE,"JayFlix.net folks strike again. I've been waiting for this Swedish film ""S som i himmelen"" to show up ever since I got a rave review from one of you in Europe over a year ago (November, 2010). I bought this DVD from Kino, which sells collectibles, but it may also be on Netflix or its equivalent, and I just found it here on Amazon! Yippee!

Let's talk about it. When you were in grade school were you the bully-er or the bully-ee? Yeah, I know I made up both of those words, but you get the idea. Where in the bullying spectrum were you? Dishing it out? Taking it? Or a silent witness....

This wonderful Swedish film (English captions) is about bullying in childhood and the scars that linger into adulthood. It is also about bigotry, provincialism, and shattered dreams. But WAIT! Before you shy away, let me add it is also about renewed hope, the healing power of love and the joy of community.

My current heartthrob Michael Nyqvist (""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" etc...) is a celebrated orchestra conductor. He is, however, felled by a tricky heart which has forced him to an early retirement. Instead of resting on his laurels on the Mediterranean or a similar life of ease, he chooses instead, to return to his old hometown (the scene of his childhood misery), knowing that no one will recognize his new name, his new persona or his new attitude. He buys the abandoned grade school building and moves in.

First thing he knows, the local pastor calls on him; he is given a complimentary bible and an invitation to be the church cantor. He apologizes and explains that he is only there to listen, not to get involved in music.

Well, one thing leads to another...you know how these things go. And before you know it, we are acquainted with many of the small town personalities: the local bully and his battered wife, the punctilious preacher and his frustrated frau, the local slut, the town ""retard,"" the current choir mistress, the elderly singers, etc., etc., etc. By this time, I was smugly certain I had it all figured out, but I was wrong.

It is beautifully filmed and well-acted; but it's the story that's transcendent with universally recognizable characters/life situations even though it takes place in a Swedish village (the film has English subtitles).

2530615,5,B000ER31LE,"As It Is In Heaven--This movie is about love and art and music--about becoming alive; review by 1.1.13 by Dan Nicholas, Santa Cruz Mountains

I rarely gush over a film, but this 2005 Oscar nominated As It Is In Heaven (Scandinavian, subtitles, some English) has to be now among my top ten favorite flicks.  It's that good.  Skipped over by much of America, it enjoyed a two year run at one major Australian theater and was a major hit in in Western Europe and New Zealand.

Have you ever sung in a choir?  Gone to church in a small town?  Loved music?  Been perhaps in love or contrarily maybe wanted to beat up somebody?  Or maybe for some time you were suffocating inside a dead marriage?  Perhaps you've worked as a minister or priest as I did for over a decade?  Or learned to hate junk religion and dead church life in general?  Or perhaps you've been at the life squelching business end of a small mind world?  (My daughter likes to say: ""Go big or go home."")  Well, if these themes touch where you live, you're in luck.  This flick is your ticket to enlightenment or at least a totally good evening of video streaming.

Indeed, how can music and art touch so many places and people among all the rivers of our lives?  Because all of the arts intersect at the heart and the soul of man.

This Swedish drama tells the story of Daniel Dareus (Michael Nyqvist), a small-town boy, beat up as a child for playing the violin, a tragic mishap sends him back late in life to his home village to retire to start over the last half of his life yet he ends up leading the local parish choir that wakes up an entire town. Frida Hallgren, Helen Sjoholm and Lennart Jahkel co-star in writer-director Kay Pollak's heartwarming tale.

The very dream of the main character in this film, Daniel Dareus (Michael Nyqvist),  is to create music that will open hearts.  Only he has to walk through the dark valley of his own heart along the way.  All's fair in art and spiritual warfare here and it takes place in a Scandinavian village one winter and spring.

Daniel is a professional musician who has to retire from Big Art in the City for health reasons.  He decides return to the village of his youth just to live and to ""listen"".  He finds on his path not only healing for his soul but for the entire town.  If ever a flick spoke of what Eastern Christians call theosis and what East and West alike call salvation, it is this film. You might think this movie is about romantic love.  And it is.  But it is more about the Eros life force that runs through all the wires of the human heart and through all the virtues along the way.  In this case the main conduit is music and the stage is a small church in a mall town.

Unsafe along the way is the flip side of virtue reflected in dumb ass morality and hypocrisy often found in church, as the lead character is asked to sign on as cantor and choir director of the village parish.  Demons roused along the way include domestic violence, fear and risk taking in general.  All forces of the dark side experience a shellacking in this delightful and innocent story.

My own father played the violin, loved music, tried to conquer his demons there.  I saw so much of him the next day, reflecting after last night's viewing.  My wife and I brought in the new year--2013--watching this film.  Treat your soul, I'd say, to a similar delight and stream this inspiring story.

2530625,4,B000ER31LE,"When I saw the first scene of the young boy playing a violin in a huge field of golden wheat, I said to myself ""I hate this film, it is trying to be artsy in the way that Bergman was."" However I stuck with it and I must admit that this film departs radically from Bergman in the sense that it doesn't fear to hit you over the head with its heartfelt themes.  It's not subtle!  It does have a message. It veers close to bathos and sometimes falls in.  And yet....there is something so nice about it that I can forgive all of its errors -- sort of like when you have a friend who annoys you and forgets to pay back the money you lent him, wrecks your car and doesn't remember your birthday, but who is so good hearted and loving that you have to love him back.

Well, sorta like that.  On a personal level the film appealed to me because all of my grandparents came from small towns in Sweden and I grew up surrounded by Swedes...so these people and their attitudes were very familiar to me.  I had to laugh when they interrupted their intense ""group therapy"" kind of session with a call for coffee!  So if you don't have that backbground, you may be less forgiving of the faults of the film.

I do think that what carried me through the obvious and predictable plot were the strong performances.  The lead, Nyquist, was wonderful!  He reminded me a bit of Richard Burton.  Seeing the joy break through his initial frozen personality was really a pleasure.  His love interest, the angelic Lena, was every bit his match. She was the moral heart of the story.  Her innate strenth, warmth and goodness, as well as her physical beauty, were wonderful to see. The world needs more people like Lena!

I've read all of the low rated reviews and I have to say that I agree with many of the points they make.  I did object to the terrible stereotype the film gives the poor pastor. I'm not sure I liked the handling of the retarded boy either.  And I did find the Austrian trip and the ending much sappier than I would have liked.  But still the film left me with a happy feeling, and that's not a bad thing!

2530642,5,B000ER31LE,"As It Is in Heaven (S som i himmelen in Swedish) is a wonderful Swedish language (with subtitles) film that stars an actor (Michael Nyqvist) that American audiences might be more familiar with since the ""Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"" hit our country (assuming you've been fortunate enough to see the movie in it's original Swedish, which is MUCH better than our Americanized Hollywood version).

It's set in a very typical small Swedish village, similar to many I've visited myself and also very similar to small towns around the U.S. in some ways....everyone knows everyone else and if someone new moves in, they are noticed immediately and either quickly integrated into the group or shunned.  Daniel (Nyqvist) is a music prodigy who has grown up and moved back to the village in which he was raised for the first 10 or so years of his life.  He's had something akin to a nervous breakdown and just wants to be left alone.  But that's not going to happen in this close-knit village.  They know he is a famous conductor and they just so happen to have a little church choir that they'd like him to consider listening to.

If the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded with me. Commonplace human situations became original, personal and immediate so that I personally felt touched by each situation. I believe I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very moved by the movie's approach to living. Haven't actually cried out of-what- joy? empathy? just deep emotion? in a very long time. I would love to find a way to show it to others.",1327190400,2,1717,4.65016501650165

2530649,1,B000ER31LE,"The premise was good.  The landscape, spectacular.  The young boy playing both violin and wind in the field of golden grain stirred our imaginations.  But the movie went downhill after this first scene.  Where is the symphony of dark and light, the interplay of cold and warmth that could have been invoked by a Swedish winter and a slowly emerging community?  Where is the deep mystery and magic of music that comes not from some fairyland ether but from actual notes and harmony and rhythm?  It would have been nice to see and hear some real music emerge in those early sessions.  In real life, untrained but passionate singers can perform miracles, but not by simply holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes.  Give us some music, maestro!  The true musician does not sweat blood and tears when creating music, but is energized and enlivened, whether s/he is conducting a symphony orchestra or improvising with neighbors.  One unmistakable message was that actual ""work"" or ""study"" of music does not open the heart.  If the heart is truly open, a symphony or a spate of birdsong or a choir of a small church are all sources of joy and delight.  It would have been nice for the movie not to vilify the orchestral music that was our anti-hero's life for so long, and that brings many of us an unending depth of joy, caring and community!

The music, the emotions, the stereotypes in this movie were so ""dumbed down"" that it was hard to keep watching.  With such a premise, and with the true power of music, this could have been a masterpiece.  As is was, it dripped with sentimentality and banality.  The best part was the toning of the choir at the end, but even then I had to close my eyes to keep from seeing the idiotic smile through the blood.  Too, too much and a ridiculous message.  This is not love, this is neglect.

A truly caring and mature community would have done many things differently, but then of course we wouldn't have had this sappy movie.  We would have had a strong police force protecting the battered wife, neighbors offering her a home and helping to care for her children while she healed.  We would have had a minister who struggled with his demons, even as he cared for his ""flock"".  The people who supposedly ""loved"" our conductor would have learned details about his heart condition and helped him heal and rest and build strength.  A man with extreme heart challenges should not be spinning merrily through the streets all alone on a bike, climbing stairs, wielding an axe, running around barefoot in the Swedish winter.  Learning to survive and thrive physically is just as loving a gesture as smiling and singing while someone dies alone in a bathroom.

Love is so much more complex and profound than angels on a wall or starry eyes, just as music is so much more complex and profound than emoting on indefinite tones while ignoring the true needs of those around us. With the help of caring friends, and with just a little common sense, our anti-hero could have skipped a lot of the drama and lived a long and increasingly healthy life.  He could have, eventually, become a hero, not by ""saving"" a community, but by growing up and taking responsibility for his own life and health and choices.",1318118400,11,3236,4.6234676007005255

2530658,2,B000ER31LE,"The film begins with an interesting premise.  A world-class conductor nearly dies from a heart attack, retires from conducting, returns to the Swedish village of his youth and purchases the now vacant local school building.  He becomes the director of the local church choir and is drawn back into the world of 'conducting' but on different terms.  This time he will seek the beauty of music without the pressures and competitiveness of international concert halls.  The setting is nicely realized, as the seasons change (mirroring the changes in the man) and there may even be some love in store for him.

So what's wrong with this picture?  (Caution: SPOILERS ahead.)

What's wrong is that the film is built on every conceivable romantic (as in academic romanticism) cliche.  The village churchman is a heavily-repressed pornography reader who is unable to respond to his more human and down to earth wife.  One of the village men is a former bully/current wife beater, who attempts to control his wife at every turn (while the conductor composes a song for her about personal freedom in which she will sing the solo and drive her trogladyte husband up the wall).

The subtexts are: everyone is good at heart (except they aren't, here).  Community is beautiful (except that this community includes some classic lowlifes and no visible police force until the film's end).  Expression trumps skill.  The heart is more important than the head.  Performing music on a grand, highly professional level will kill you (literally wear out your heart, in the film's words).

The conductor uses squirrely techniques to inspire his choir.  They dance, hold hands, emote, etc.  He tells them that the music is in the air and they must somehow draw it down and reify it.  The film ends at a music festival in Austria.  Unfortunately there is no elevator in the building and the conductor must climb the stairs, thus risking another heart attack.  He collapses in the men's room, his face bloodied when his head bounces off the plumbing pipes and radiator.  Slumped on the floor he tries to wipe the blood from his face by employing used towels from the waste paper bin.  Eventually he hears the voices of his choir through a grate; the choir's voices inspire the members of the audience.  Everyone is elevated by song.  Community is restored.  The conductor dies happily, sitting on the floor of a men's toilet.

If you want to have your romantic ideology reinforced, with several dollops of sentimentality and some brief nudity, this is the picture you will not want to miss.  The good news is that there are some lovely moments in the film, nice cinematography and a fine performance by Michael Nyqvist.  The alteration of a few scenes and a dash of realism here and there would have made for a fine film rather than a preachy, predictable one.",1304380800,14,2835,4.85

2530665,5,B000ER31LE,"This remarkable Swedish film from 2004 was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. There were no reviews by any major American media that I found except for Variety and the Houston Chronicle (in 2009). Apparently the film has never been widely released even in art houses in the U.S. despite being a big hit in various places overseas. The Houston reviewer pointed out that in certain ways it is melodramatic and the plot predictable with the bad guys (the town pastor and an abusive, alcoholic husband) getting their comeuppance as their wives are liberated and true love being fulfilled. But even she admitted ""it's done with such thrumming revelation and infectious joy, I instantly forgave any and all sins that came before. I had to. After all: Sin = a big fat lie. Forgiveness = everything.""

The last reference is to the statement of the pastor's wife who, during an emotional outburst responding to her husband's accusations of sinfulness on her part for participating in a joyous party where she got tipsy, lets him have it about his sanctimony and the repression in the version of Christianity he purveys.

I didn't take her outburst about the unreality of sin as the ""message"" of the movie, though one disposed to indulge that notion might do so. However, it would be hard not to see the pain inflicted on various characters in the movie as the result of sin. Indeed, if there was no sin, why would forgiveness by necessary at all? And forgiveness is certainly a central theme of the movie. But it's primary theme is most certainly the opening of one's own heart and spirit, finding oneself in community and in relationship.

The title speaks to the conviction of the film that heaven, or any foretaste we will experience in this life, is realized only in finding our unique individual spirit within a community of love. The powerful climax of the film (despite its implausibility) presents a moving symbol of the transcendent, ""rapturous"" state of being - imagined in the New Testament as being present at a great feast where all social distinctions and divisions have given way to joyful recognition of love.unity, and yes pleasure. In the harmony of the choir each person retains his or her own voice while blending magnificently into a sound and song that soars beyond compare.

The film is magical with compelling performances, terrific music, and a vision so very rare in today's cinema. How is it possible that this film had no theatrical release in the United States? It is our loss. But thank God it has made its way to DVD and Netflix (streaming no less).",1294963200,4,2578,4.79954954954955
2530666,5,B000ER31LE,"With ""As it is in heaven"", Kay Pollack once more brought back the power of the feelings from an existential perspective, where the childhood memories nurtured the personal epic of a renowned and succesful director and famed violinist, Daniel Dareus, worldly acclaimed; but at the same time desperate, alone and emotionally wounded due some painful memories of his childhood.

So, in the middle of the turmoil due the fame, he decides to make a stop and undertake a journey to his roots to his birthplace where he will reencounter with himself. But soon, his rejoining with the music will put in motion, when he accepts to conduct the chorus of the local church. A bunch of women and men who are far to be professionals, but filled to learn and who will feel the call of this singular man due his wise indications and unforgettable teachings.

As you may guess, this decision will cause a real conmotion in the town, specially two people: the spiritual leader of the town, whose inner demons take part of a double moral; while the other is an old schoolmate of daniel, who overtly abuses of his woman beating her and trying to make her life a hellish mess. At the meantime, the progressive cohesion of the group fortifies still more, giving Daniel the deserved support to undertake and surmount with bravery all the obstacles and prejudices, specially when a colossal surprise is about to come.

Since ""My life as a dog"" we had not experienced such powerful, ambitious and engaging film that contains more than a simple issue to be dealt, magnificently written and better acted.

Nominated as Best Foreign Film in 2004, the movie curiously has a very close appraoch respect another nominated one ""Les choristes"", being defeated by ""mar Adentro.""

I've been in chiors, been where folks clashed as this choir did; where folks went through their own personal hells but all in all, they put their voices and gave it all they got. In this movie, a renown musical conductor has a heart attack, and he goes home to his hometown to recover. But he meets via the local businessman, a choir that could use some help, and with his expertise, he makes them into a force to be reckoned with. Of course there are some characters. Daniel, the ex conductor who goes home and finds something more; Stig, the minister who with his wife, Ingar, have their own issues dealing with God and their marriage. Gabriella, the abused wife of the town bully, Conny, who also bullied Daniel when they were young. Siv, the little goody two shoes who is too moral to let her hair down a bit and Lena, the young sweet, honest yet misguided lady who is attracted to Daniel but has her own issues and Arne, who wants the best for the choir but not necessarily for others. I think one of the best things to happen in this movie is the ending. They were supposed to sing at the competition but Daniel is unavailable, but they start singing when Tore(the mentally retarded who asks to join the chior)starts it off by singing his part and the others join in then the audience one by one joins in.

And the whole film was marred by yet another portrayal of a sick, twisted minister, which seems to be the film industry's favorite project. When as Christians we found ourselves relieved that everyone had left the church, you have to know there is an anti-Christian bias at work in the warp and woof of the film. In the end we found the movie depressing, which for a movie noted as ""inspirational"" I think is at least worth noting.

In typical fashion for a post-1960s film, the church is portrayed as corrupt and hypocritical, causing me to wonder anew whether there are any screenwriters or directors out there with a spiritual backbone. The so-called climax of the movie is laughably unconvincing, when an entire audience is won over by a motley choir voicing nonsense syllables on stage. (This ranks right down there with the ridiculous town hall meeting in ""Field of Dreams"" for shallow audience manipulation.) Don't bother with this promising flop.

2530674,3,B000ER31LE,"In this Swedish melodrama, Daniel, a world-famous conductor, suffers a near fatal heart attack and emotional breakdown and returns to his home village in northern Sweden which he left as a child of seven after being viciously bullied.

Daniel buys the abandoned building of the local grade school and sets up house. As depicted in these early scenes, he seems shellshocked, scarcely able to speak, already three quarters dead. Unexpectedly he is drawn into the life of the village through the church choir. By training them and learning about the lives of these simple folk, Daniel begins to heal himself. Of course, he also benefits from the love of a good woman, the comely blond Lena.

NOTE: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.
But the village is not all that it seems. Beneath the repressed Swedish exteriors of the singers lies a tumult of emotions. Daniel makes an enemy of the village vicar, who is tormented by guilt about sexuality and has adopted a particularly joyless form of Christianity. He is cast in the traditional mode of the stern Luthern pastor whose sterness crosses the border into cruelty and sadism, as perfected in the movies of Ingmar Bergmann. There is also Daniel's boyhood tormenter, now grown up into an awful wife abuser who batters one of the members of the choir and Daniel himself once again.

The movie meanders along in an entirely predictable way. Daniel is in love but cannot find the courage and the words to express himself. He coughs at frequent intervals, reminder the viewer that he is not long for this world. There is also entirely too much blood in this movie, which ends with a cheap climax that spoils much of what has gone before.

I can't say this is a bad movie -- in fact much of it is quite entertaining. But I can't call it a good movie either. It's cheap and sentimental and doesn't really face up to the issues it raises.",1284249600,7,1876,4.675757575757576

2530676,5,B000ER31LE,"When Swedish star conductor Daniel Darus is felled by a heart attack, he decides to clear his overstuffed schedule and return to his childhood village, where he settles in an abandoned school building. His artist name ensures he's incognito, but he is not allowed to remain aloof for long - the village community draws him in, and before long he is asked to become leader of the church choir, being the musical expert he is; an invitation the vicar will soon regret.

Thus begins 'As it is in heaven', a movie that for a while seems to be about village quaintness and small details. But Daniel's presence in the village soon becomes a catalyst for events that will change his own life and that of those around him dramatically. The theme of 'finding your own voice', with which he starts his choral instructions, soon expands outside the confines of the rehearsals. So does the notion that all begins with listening - in the course of the story many a villager finally speaks his or her mind, and is heard. The dark undercurrents of the seemingly peaceful village community are ruthlessly exposed. Yet no matter how much is uprooted, the sense of community prevails, and staunchly loyal to their unconventional conductor the motley little village choir rises to unexpected heights. Meanwhile, Daniel falls in love, with the choir as much as with one woman in it, and confronts his childhood nemesis.

It is in essence a simple story, but it is so lovingly told, and has a cast of such involving and endearing characters, that it is absolutely irresistible and ultimately incredibly moving. Yet its bittersweet end avoids any sentimentality. The acting is beyond excellent on all counts.

2530678,4,B000ER31LE,"There is a book on Swedish film in the 1st half of the 20th century which has a title which could be translated as ""The Outward Journey and the Homeward Journey"" (see Ingmar Bergman's _Wild Strawberries_ for a prime example of the latter).  This film begins with a homeward journey, but gradually shows a whole range of characters gradually turning outward from the egocentric shells, while fulfilling the Gospel admonition that ""you must become like little children,"" which I think would be a great alternative title.  The ability of the pastor's wife to express pent-up rage in a perfectly convincing manner while one of the other choir members portrays repressed jealousy with quiet glares are both outstanding, if polar opposites, and we should not think the men are bad actors for their coldness -- they're just acting as Swedish men are usually stereotyped.  The singing voice of the ""abused wife"" character is also beyond wonderful.

I also was happy to see a portait of the realities of life in rural Sweden which showed how very much like life in small town America it is.

Although not rated by the MPAA, I'd classify it as R or for mature audiences - some nudity, sexual situations & violence.  Some dialogue between the town's pastor and his wife will offend some, and the portrayal of the pastor verges on being anti-clerical and/or anti-religious.  While I chafed at times during some of those scenes, the intensity of the plot & acting overshadowed those concerns for me.

I admit that I waited a while to watch it because the plot seemed dubious and the movie runs a bit more than 2 hours in length.  However, when I did finally sit down to watch it it didn't take long before I was totally engrossed in the film.  The plot doesn't do ""As it is in Heaven"" justice.  This is an outstanding film about confronting your fears and insecurities, improving your relationships with others and realizing your dreams.  All the characters had something or other that needed confrontation which probably made them all the more acceptable to the audience.  That short synopsis probably doesn't generate a lot of interest either.  However, it is the manner in which all is revealed that gives ""As it is in Heaven"" its' impact.  Indeed, the film actually wasn't long considering all it accomplished.  The film's positive energy and the multitude of stories within the stories keeps us focussed throughout the movie.  By the time ""As it is in Heaven"" ended I was emotionally spent and I realized that this was because of how well I was drawn into the lives of all the characters.

Daniel (played by the remarkable Michael Nyqvist) is a world-renowned orchestra conductor who must leave his glittering lifestyle on the world stage because of a health problem (a weak heart).  He decides to go back to the village where he was raised to live quietly, although we find out his childhood there was not ideal.  His plans for solitude and quiet are thwarted when the local church choir seeks his opinion on their musical ability and he cannot say no.

Daniel's involvement in the music and the lives of the choir members of this small village becomes an amazing journey.  Because of his influence in these people's lives, what had been left hidden beneath the surface starts to be known.  Things happen!  The film provides much to ponder about human nature and behavior.  This is no Swedish chick flick.

Others I know who saw this film also loved it.  One woman said it was the best movie she had ever seen, and a man I know was surprised by how impressive this film was.  I highly recommend this film for the experience it will give you!",1263945600,5,1217,4.557603686635945

2530694,5,B000ER31LE,"Film Review  SAGF-1

(This review was originally published in the Swedish American Geneologist, December, 2008)

S som i Himmelen (As It Is in Heaven), 2004, directed by Kay Pollak, DVD non-USA format, Swedish with English subtitles, Amazon.com $25.99 plus shipping.

Almost unknown in the US, this beautiful and heartwarming film from Sweden has been described by critics as one of the best Swedish films made in recent years and has been nominated for several awards in Europe. It was recently shown at the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia after our annual Semlor gathering. I quickly rushed to find a copy for myself to share with others. Regrettably, I will have to try and convert it to US format, or find a European format DVD player, to show it other than at the Museum. So unlike the popular fare being churned out by Hollywood, the film deserves much wider acclaim in the US among all moviegoers, not just Swedish Americans.

Taking place in a small village, Ljusker, in the far northern province of Norrland, the story is about a small boy (Daniel Dareus) raised by a single mother, who has a talent for the violin but is bullied by local boys. He grows up to become a world-famous musician and conductor, driven by his talent and desire for perfection, to ill health and exhaustion. He returns alone to his little village to recover and rest, buying the now vacant old village schoolhouse to live in. The local people do not remember him as a child but know of his reputation as a conductor. Members of the small village church choir ask him to help them with their music, and he reluctantly agrees. His methods are unorthodox but the choir members come to love him. Others, including the Pastor, question his motives and methods.

The story unfolds to reveal how he affects all those in the village not only in their music but also to grow in their personal lives. All Daniel (played by Michael Nyqvist) ever wanted to do in life was to help people find their own voice, and he is immensely successful in doing so. The Choir, the Church, and the village are all transformed as a result of his presence. It is the rare film that is so moving that it can give one a lump in the throat almost from beginning to end.

Along the way, the Pastor has an epiphany, a battered wife gains confidence as a star soloist, a developmentally disabled boy is discovered to have a great bass voice, and many others face up to their talents and to the issues in their lives. And they create music to stir the heart and evoke God's grace in fraternity and mutual love. Especially moving is the song that Daniel writes for Gabriela (Gabriela's song), in which she gains confidence over her fears to sing in a Village concert. (Gabriela is played by Helen Sjholm, who was the voice of Kristina in the Opera, Kristina fran Duvemla). Other fine Swedish singers including Frida Hallgren, Andre Sjberg, Ingela Olsson, and Lennart Jhkel, who perform as members of the choir. You will also hear other familiar songs beautifully sung, including ""Amazing Grace"" sung in English, and ""Beautiful Saviour"", sung wonderfully in Swedish.

Try and find a way to see this memorable film. If you do not know Swedish, the subtitles will let you enjoy the film just as well. You will also see splendid photography of the village and the landscape in Norrland and a glimpse of village life in Sweden in modern times. As is common in Swedish films there are a few minor nude scenes, but not lascivious or offensive and certainly acceptable for teenagers and up. The Swedish habit of always portraying the clergy as flawed and hypocritical is also present in this film, but the overriding story of the power of love and grace in people's lives more than makes up for this Pastor's human failing.

  I was recommended by a Swedish friend to watch this film, and so, on her good opinion, I did. I will never regret that move! This is a film that I now consider one of my very favourites. It has everything that one would ever want in a movie, music, dramatic moments, humour, emotion, a little romance, class, small-town vibes, brilliant acting, and again... the music. Michael Nyqvist is absolutely perfect in the role of Daniel Dareus, the conductor who must take rest from his life-consuming career as world-famous conductor, to recuperate in the little town where he was born. Frida Hallgren is adorable as his potential love-interest. Helen Sjoholm is absolutely stunning as the woman who is abused by her violent husband. Each person in the town has their own story, and each story is as interesting as the next. I don't think you can walk away from this film without being completely moved.",1250553600,,1206,5.548913043478261
2530697,4,B000ER31LE,"I picked up this movie in the second hand section of my local DVD shop as a gamble. To sum things up I can say it's an ode to life and love, rekindling the flames of our passion and the spiritual engine that drives our lives that needs renewal at times, breathing life into things considered lost.

In this movie it is a man who through music brings to harmonic oscillation and revival the respectively muted and paled sounds and colors in the souls of a group of villagers in a remote snowed under Swedish village. He used to be a famous conductor, who, after a heart attack, goes back to his native village where he had an unhappy childhood to that extend that he changed his name as he became famous. As a consequence, when he returns, nobody knows his true identity; he's simply that famous conductor who, for whatever reason, has come to live in their village in the former little school building.

As soon as he arrives he's approached by the local reverent to come and listen to their local choir and maybe give some advice. The reverent gets a lot more than he bargained for as the conductor soon takes over and inspires the choir members to find their true paths by opening their hearts, originally to liberate their musical talents, but soon the new found freedom spills over in their private lives.

As the musical level increases of the choir, traditional patterns are let go off increasingly, which, seeing his influence on his flock wane, displeases the reverent. The line to him is crossed when he sees his own wife letting go of their rigid life style and his ice cold, stiff and loveless grip on his community starts to crumble away.

The resulting tensions make the reverent fire the conductor, but the only result is the choir moving out of the church building for their rehearsals and coming together in the conductor's house. As various choir members open up their hearts, they start to make big changes in their lives that will radically change them, including that of their conductor.

Literally the final chord in this movie, depending on your state of mind, will be either considered moving or sentimental. I will confess I was deeply touched by its beauty (I sang in a choir for years myself so I know how the soul can be stirred in a moment like that) and considered it a perfect ending.

I think it's true for the movie as a whole, that depending on how cynical you are, this movie will annoy you (calling it just a series of clich's) or move you. I thought it was beautiful and will revisit it many times in the future, especially in moments I need some recharging of my own batteries. It is a movie that dares to try and invoke a huge sentiment with simple truths and seduces you to open up your heart as well, so come on, give it a go, what do you have to lose?",1228780800,3,2792,4.464705882352941

Daniel Dareus a famous musician returns to his Childhood village Ljusker in Northern Sweden after ending his career in the aftermath of a heart attack. The members of the local church choir ask him to help them. His professional methods are not easily understood by the locals but the choir members love him. The drama filled events that unfold result in people finding the courage to face their fears and to grow, something that is not appreciated by everyone. All his life all Daniel wanted to do was to help people finding their voice, and for the first time in his life he truly succeeds in doing that in more than one way.

In brief, the story covers the life an acclaimed orchestra composer who, for apparent health reasons, forgoes his carer and returns to the rural town of his birth.  Here, he is asked to manage a small local church choir.  His methods are unusual and he soon earns the ire of the local minister who is straight laced and wracked by guilt.  His wife, however, yearns to break free and the choir provides the perfect opportunity.  Other members of the choir carry their own burdens including a gifted woman who is in a brutal relationship with her husband.  Again, the choir proves to provide the momentum for her to address her problems.

As a study of human relationships, ""As it is in Heaven"" is a tour de force.  Do not let the language deter you from seeing this masterpiece.  It is one of the best films of the year.",1184716800,29,1107,4.5353535353535355
2530707,5,B000ER31LE,"I missed this film on it's initial theatrical release, however I managed to see a DVD release from my local video hire library. A slow building film about Daniel, an international conductor, who returns to the village of his birth having not lived there since age 7. Daniel has come home for a quiet life and to confront the odd demon from his youth. What he really wants is to be left to live his life in peace and contentment - what he gets is the villagers wanting him to take an active part in conducting and developing the local church choir. Still waters run very deep in this village and many of the choir members have issues with their past and present lives. Daniel is unwittingly drawn into the lives of the villagers, but through him they are able to confront their problems and shine through. The music is good and the song Daniel writes for Gabriella, a member of the choir, is sung beautifully by her character and as you read the words of the song in this subtitled film, you easily see that this really is a song about Daniel. As the film reaches it's climax, the entire choir realise and understands that they don't need to rely on Daniel to make their voices sing in unison - what he  told them they could achieve happens spontaneously.

A lovely film that deserves to be seen by a wide audience. Slow building but well worth watching to the very last credit. Deservedly nominated for an Oscar in its category of Best Foreign Language Film.

This story is not for analyzing but for breaking the analytical, stubborn mind and cutting through its cold, deceptive intellectualism to the center of one's being - Love.

Dry, analytical words are of no value. They can give the ego a sense of superiority but deprive one from experiencing beauty and joy.

It would be nice if one could let go of one's stupid intellectualism and dive into the sea of the Heart.

This is what this movie is about. It is not about analysing and about being philosophical, it is about shifting from living as a thinking being (i.e. being dead) to living as a listening being, where the abundance of Love is.

When we listen to classical music which overwhelms us we don't sit there analysing the notes or the rhythm or the age when it was written (well, normal people don't). We surrender to it. This movie is about surrender of that which keeps us away from happiness, it is about letting go of the cold intellect and waking up to Life.

2530712,1,B000ER31LE,"A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as ""well-worn,"" which seems to be a euphemism for ""shop-worn,"" ""clich,"" or ""stupefyingly unoriginal."" Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: ""As It Is In Heaven"" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the kttbullar?)

A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:

-- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;

-- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;

-- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;

-- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is ""Best Boy,"" a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in ""There's Something About Mary,"" or turned into plaster saints as here.)

So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of ""The O.C.""  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis--vis the USA: kitsch is global.",1152057600,53,4356,5.109550561797753
2530713,4,B000ER31LE,"""S som i himmelen"" (""As in Heaven"" or sometimes called ""As it is in Heaven"" in English speaking countries) is a very sentimental, heart-warming, funny, and ultimately charming Swedish film that is not afraid of showing emotions. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2004, in several ways this Swedish film reminds us of an equally sentimental and touching film ""Les Choristes"" from France, which was incidentally nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2005.

I wrote about these things about Oscar because `As in Heaven' shares a popular theme - power of music - and despite some flaws such as rather stereotyped characters, the film manages to tell its story very powerfully to the end. And we all love music, and you know that.

The story is a familiar one. It is about the world-famous conductor Daniel (Michael Nyqvist) whose career is suddenly interrupted by illness. He is forced to go back to the small village where he lived as a boy. The people of this cold, snowy land welcome him as celebrity, and ask him to coach the local chorus group singing in a creaky church hall.

Now you know where the story is going. Daniel accepts the job reluctantly, and finds that the singers are far from perfect. Some of them are not nice to work with, and some have problems at home. Even Daniel himself has to confront his own life when he knows it's time to change, for him and for the community.

The film is, I thought, overlong with very unnecessary coda in Austria; some of the actors overact (like the tormented priest) and its rather metaphorical conclusion is hard to believe, but the film's story, familiar as it is, is strongly told with a chain of episodes. The most impressive part of the story is, for me, Daniel's love romance with free-spirited girl Lena, perfectly played by Frida Hallgren (imagine lovely Michelle Williams). In addition to the music, her sweet character is the brightest spot in the film.

Not everything works, I admit, and director Kay Pollack (after 18 year absence) probably needs more subtle touch when drawing the supporting characters like a housewife suffering domestic violence or an intellectually handicapped boy. I also read the complaints on the net about the film's being melodramatic and showing too much emotion, and though my impression about the film does not change, some of their opinions are quite understandable.

But I was very much attracted to the film and its characters in spite of (or perhaps because of) these sweet and sentimental moments. The film is not perfect, just like many other films in the world, but it is certain that `As in Heaven' has its power to move us with its story confidently told, positive attitudes toward life, and of course music as the bond to tie the community together.",1151798400,20,2792,4.782157676348548

After I saw this film I heard a physician on public radio talking about 'sound therapy' and the ways in which music, song and sound can heal the body.",1146096000,81,401,4.115384615384615

I sobbed from a spiritual/soul epiphany sparked by this film. Films like this that dig beneath the surface of human experience are once in a blue moon.  It demonstrates a sincere belief in the good of people- it speaks the message again and again that one's best is all anyone can ever do.  It serves to humanize all members of a society, regardless of their actions (referring to battered woman and husband). It is a story of a group of individuals learning to listen to one another and harmonize- the choir is a metaphor for the grander society; an indispensable lesson for the well-being of our world.  It is about release of judgment and fears.

A beautiful film!  If you enjoyed Life is Beautiful (Roberto Benini) or Together(another Swedish film)- you may really like As It Is In Heaven.",1143244800,87,896,4.748387096774193

8113516,5,B000ER31LE,"Although the film is in Swedish, it's one that anyone who loves music, complicated relationships and unpredictable endings can appreciate. It's very hopeful in many ways - but also has the Scandinavian-like darknesses for contrast. Michael Nyqvist was just super - and although this was not one of his most publicized roles (outside of Sweden) it is worth treasuring.",1518566400,,367,5.237288135593221

8113518,5,B000ER31LE,"Sweden's honored and beloved actor, Michael Nyqvist, left a legacy of brilliant performances, but none that surpasses this one. Full of nuanced and raw emotion, this is his tour de force. If you can see only one of his movies, this is the one.",1507420800,,243,4.545454545454546
8113519,2,B000ER31LE,"There's a lot of beauty and raw emotion in this film but there was no need to harm an animal for the sake of the story.  (Early on in the film there's a scene where a beautiful white bunny is shot, crudely mocked, shaken and thrown against a wall.  It is VERY disturbing.)  There's no reason, whatsoever, for this kind of thing.  It goes completely against every ounce of beauty that you're working to achieve.

While one would think the film is mostly about music, it is really about human interaction and the need for validation.  Each person's voice is a mirror into their soul.  The actors seem so real and natural.  I loved the stark honesty of the human interactions--nothing is sugar-coated as in American films.",1498780800,,462,4.3882352941176475
8113523,5,B000ER31LE,"Im very aware that Im far from the target audience for this film, yet the writer in me indirectly influenced my interest in this film. Additionally, seeing one of the locations (Austria)pertaining to the movie plots of this film got my husband and I talking about the location as he has family members on his mothers side who live in Austria. Additionally,I admit that I more or less decided to check out the film As It Is in Heaven because it was listed to be one of the films that Michael Nyqvist starred in as music conductor Daniel Dareus. The character of Daniel Dareus has a very difficult childhood before going on to achieve much music accomplishments. After coming close to death, Daniel Dareus ends up moving back to a small town in Sweden where he grew up and meeting church pastor Stig (Niklas Falk) . His life is changed even further when he is invited to help other various church members with their choir singing Lena (Frida Hallgren), Inger (Ingela Olsson), Arne (Lennart Jahkel), Siv (Ylva Loof), Gabriela (Helen Sjoholm).  The lives of some of the church members are very dramatic to say the least . The character of Holmfridd (Mikhael Rahm) has to endure unnecessary taunting from fellow church goer Arne over his weight. Inger is married to Stig,loves him a lot, and she bravely confronts him about some of the vices he has as more of a loving way to try to help him see that he is harder on himself than necessary. Gabriela enjoys participating in the church choir but has to go through so much just to be able to do this because of the dynamics with her husband Connie (Per Morberg). Arne has a relative named Tore (Andre Sjoberg) who shows interest in joining the choir group one day and some of the other members are reluctant to accept him until Daniel helps convince them to allow Tore to join. Lena is the character in the group with a heart of gold who treats other people in a considerate manner yet she also has to endure much judgement from Siv who like Stig is harsher on herself than she has to be.",1498608000,,2031,4.519021739130435
