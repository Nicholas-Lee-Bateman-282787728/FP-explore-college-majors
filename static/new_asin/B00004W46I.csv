1359966,5,B00004W46I,"There are few romantic films that just melt my heart, but this is one.  It just feels so innocent and sweet throughout that there is no choice but to fall in love with it.  The story is never contrived.
It is the tale of a  young man (Reeve) who is visited by an elderly woman who tells him to  ""come back"" to her.  What follows is a wonderful, almost  fairy-tale romance at a beautiful hotel (the Grand Hotel on Macinaw Island  in MI, a truly awe inspiring location).
I won't ruin it, but it has a  great suprise ending, and I have yet to find a single person who does not  cry for the last fifteen minutes of the film.  So brings some tissues.  See  this film!",963360000,9,662,4.125984251968504

1360132,4,B00004W46I,"Despite the movie holding my interest, I find it a bit confusing.  Was the entire thing a dream?  An hallucination.  If not, Reeves seems to be stuck in a time-loop because his name was in the register from 1912.  But then he dies at the end and meets his true love in the beyond.  Putting aside that I don't believe in that type of thing, if he died and was with her again, then he was not in a loop (or so I think at the moment; it's all confusing).  So I'm left thinking it was all a dream/hallucination and he's still dreaming at the end.",1508457600,,542,4.066037735849057

The story is based on a novel by Richard Matheson with a score by John Barry.
For those that may forget the details of this movie they will not forget Variation 18 of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.

It is well conceived and paced for the content. The viewing audience is polarized as to whether this is the type of film they would watch, but all agree in the quality of this one. I personally think it is a keeper.",1503014400,,714,4.484615384615385

I wonder if Redford would have been a better fit for Callier though, one could imagine Seymore with Redford  but perhaps the script was a bit too light for him. Still Reeves  was strong enough and a good break from his action adventures. I thought all other aspects of this film were exceptional, very creative directing.

1360186,5,B00004W46I,"After reading Bid Time Return, many, many years ago, I was excited when the movie, Somewhere in Time, was later released: I was ""enchanted"" with both and own a VHS copy which I have viewed many times. The original book (hardcopy) was apparently loaned out; can't remember to whom, but it's gone. Makes me sad since this book was discovered by my sister, while on a business trip in California. She was so impressed with the story; she gave it to me as a gift. Sadly she died much too young, and now seeing Christopher Reeve, looking so healthy and handsome, adds to my bitter/sweet feelings for this film. It is a lovely, artistic movie for the 'young at heart' or the incurable Romantic. The beautiful music is worth owning, especially; Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (done as a piano solo). It's all here for those who yearn for another time - a gentler world, and/or perhaps a 'long- lost love'.

I saw the this on Amazon and I ordered it  and thanks to Amazon Prime it arrived two days later.

Overall this is a good buy.

He never felt romance so perhaps it was a good thing we broke up. Romance starts in the heart, not the brain and I have made this mistake my whole life. In any case, there is even an organization that dresses in this time period, and I myself would love to participate when I ever have the funds to do so. Destiny and fate are issues here, and when Christopher Reeve's character dies, it is so touching and will not leave  you dry-eyed.",1454284800,,606,4.269565217391304

I think I remember this moorland,
  The tower on the top of the tor;
I feel in the distance another existence:
  I think I have been here before.

And I think you were sitting beside me,
  In a fold in the face of the fell,
For Time at its workll go round in a circle,
  And what is befalling, befell.

I have been here before! I asserted,
  In a nook on a neck of the Nile.
I once in a crisis was punished by Isis,
  And you smiled. I remember your smile.

I had the same sense of persistence
  On the site of the seat of the Sioux;
I heard in the teepee the sound of a sleepy
  Pleistocene grunt. It was you.

The past made a promise, before it
  Began to begin to begone.
This limited gamut brings you again. Damn it,
  How long has this got to go on?

1360578,5,B00004W46I,"This film will be remembered as a cult classic for any number of reasons not least of which is the musical scores selected. Almost impossible to top Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody for romance. John Barry's supplemental score is equally memorable. Then there is the iconic Grand Hotel as much a part of the story as the rest. Then there is the lovely Jane Seymour, aka Elise McKenna. There were very memorable acting moments. The only drawback might be the fabricated time travel modus operandi. Psych yourself into the past doesn't quite cut it for me but the Lincoln penny which destroys the illusion, was a clever stunt. If you can get past that bit of fabrication let the haunting music carry you the rest of the way.",1454025600,,713,4.712

1360652,4,B00004W46I,"To describe it as a *time travel* film, or *science fiction* film is quite a mistake. It's a fantasy, which utilizes 'travel through time' as a minor plot element. Definitely one of those sentimental stories, but still quite fun - and sad - to watch. There is no need to try some fancy scientific explanation or some fancy machine to explain Reeve's time-shift - and that's what really sets this apart from similar attempts at a fantasy/science fiction mash-up. Essentially it's the classic story about how love transcends time. It reminds me of a dialogue sequence (between Ahmad and the Princess) from Alexander Korda's The Thief of Baghdad (1940):
[At the pool]
Princess: Who are you?
Ahmad: Your slave.
Princess: Where have you come from?
Ahmad: From the other side of time, to find you.
Princess: How long have you been searching?
Ahmad: Since time began.
Princess: Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Ahmad: To the end of time.",1451433600,,947,4.815950920245399

1360679,5,B00004W46I,"Wow, I thought I was fairly unique in how I responded to this movie.  It is so nice to see so many other people moved as much or more than I am every time I watch this movie.  Over the years I have watched it many times and I am always very moved by the end of the film.  The ending is just so incredible and moving because the story sucks you up and takes you in.  The impact on the audience is a testament to the quality of the actors.  You can tell they put their heart and soul into this production.  Christopher Reeves turned down several other more lucrative opportunities he was offered to perform in this film because of the emotional challenge that it offered him.  That speaks of a drive to be and do his very best and you can really see it in this movie.  The performance of Jane Seymour is also so complete and encompassing, and she is a beauty.  They way they look at each other, the sacrifice each of them make for each other, gosh, I get shivers just thinking about it as I write this.  Watching this movie makes you think about what love can be like in your life, about the infinite possibilities of total and complete love for your mate.

The music score that accompanies this film is TOP NOTCH.  It is some of the most moving music for me that I have ever heard.  I listen to it and think about my love for my wife and the people in my life I have lost and sometimes it tears my soul, it is SO moving.  If you are considering the soundtrack you will not be disappointed if you appreciate the music while watching the movie.  Listening to the music in a quiet setting while you can reflect on things.... oh, I cannot say enough about it.

Even though this film didn't have the budget others of the time did, everything about this film, from the music, to the actors, to the setting, is quality, quality, quality.  You can tell that the people involved put their whole soul into this movie.  Just the music, in hearing the violin solo, you can FEEL the emotion pouring out of it by the violinist.

So yeah, I like this film. ;)  This is my second copy of this film as I cannot find my previous copy and I will not be without it for those moments when I have to have my fix for this movie.  I HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone reading these reviews that is considering purchasing this film or renting it.",1449792000,4,2322,4.196388261851016

1360739,5,B00004W46I,"This is a classic romantic movie filmed mostly on the jewel of Michigan, Mackinaw Island and The Grand Hotel. While the movie is a classic, addition material on this DVD tells how it began and how it was made in addition to the fondness on cast and crew being a part of something so special.
My wife and I spent a few days at The Grand both on our 25th and 50th anniversies. The movie captures the love and happy feelings felt in such a special place.
Buy this movie, watch it with the person you love and when you have the chance, go and stay at The Grand Hotel for a few days. You will never forget or regret it.",1440892800,,614,4.082644628099174

1360786,5,B00004W46I,"This is the film classic of 1979 filmed shortly after Christopher Reeve's starring roll in the Superman film.  This movie was produced almost entirely on scenic Mackinac Island in Northern Michigan and features the equally famous Grand Hotel (America's Summer Home).  As of 2014 every fall there's a ""Somewhere In Time"" weekend at the Grand Hotel with members of the cast & crew returning to participate in workshops and panel discussions with guests.  And this film does not have over-the-top digital effects, the time travel sequences are accomplished thru acting and basic camera transitions.  The musical score of ""Somewhere in Time"" by the famed British composer John Barry (James Bond film series) reportedly is the most requested music of any of his popular film scores. This is an out and out romantic film folks and illustrates that if there's a good story and strong actors superficial digital effects are completely unnecessary to produce a successful outcome.  For lovers of all ages I would say and highly recommend ""Somewhere In Time"", and for full disclosure I live in Michigan.",1435968000,,1093,5.117977528089888

He and Jane stayed at the college during filming which is now Mission Point Resort.  everyone should watch this movie if only so when I ask you..""Have you been to Mackinac Island?"" and you say no...my next question is Always, ""Have you seen ""Somewhere in Time?"" It truly is unchanged...beautiful turn of the century cottages peeking out out over the straits of Mackinac...no cars(they brought them on for portions of the movie) bicycle and horse drawn carriages are the mode of transportation.

For the last thirty years I assumed this was just another touchy-feely, huggy-kissy romance.  I have been mesmerized by the main theme music from the first time I heard it and play it on my piano regularly.  I'm not sure why I finally decided to watch it (maybe the inclusion of the aspect of time travel intrigued me) but it has become one of my favorite movies.  I watched it four times the first week I had it, including the commentaries and interviews.  I also purchased an additional copy of the DVD as a back up, the sound track CD and the novel upon which it was based.  The book answered quite a few of the questions I had after watching the DVD and filled in many of the details of the story that a two hour movie must only infer to, or omit entirely.  As usual, the novel was much more detailed than the movie, but I actually prefer the changes made to the screenplay which gave credence to the concept of time travel and its implications.  I am a devout INSITE-er now (look it up on the Somewhere in Time website).  Not just a ""chick flick"" but a ""chuck flick"" for guys too.",1428624000,,1190,4.276785714285714

It received virtually no attention at the time, but has since stood the test of time in the hearts of those who've seen it. It's impossible to separate Barry's score from this film, and I believe it may be the most compelling score ever written for a motion picture. Apart from the music, which really becomes a ""character"" in the film, the actors all deliver perfect performances. It may not be a perfect movie in terms of technical achievements, but it has an ethereal quality to it, and this can only be appreciated by those who've really watched the film. It deserves your complete attention; you may be surprised on the places this movie takes you. In a sense, it takes you on a journey into your own mind, and the memories you've locked away for many years. Give it a try. You won't forget this movie.",1425772800,,884,4.53125

Jane Seymour was on top also.  Christopher Plummer was good, he sure can look evil when he wants to.  So he was a good match.
The story content was one that makes a person stop and think about life after death, which I do believe in.  I don't know that I believe we can really ""go back in time""; I would not attempt that.  But maybe

It was instantly a favorite of mine and has remained so for many viewings over the decades.  Jane Seymour still haunts me....stunningly beautiful as her face shows her love for Reeve.  I teared up again this morning and decided to buy four of these to give to a few young employees of mine that appear to bury their romanticism as they jaunt through everyday life.

in high school with a girlfriend and didn't want to go and I loved it every since. Reeves is in one of his best roles ever and of course
the gorgeous Jane Seymour is fabulous and stunning as always! the story is written great of course and well acted by all and
the director keeps it moving along and you really want it all to work out but you know in the end it won't but I won't give it away

1361112,4,B00004W46I,"Released in 1980 and nearly dumped down the memory hole, Somewhere In Time was saved by TV where it rolled into the hearts of many a fan. Based on Richard Mathesons Bid Time Return, the film is both an interesting time travel piece and a touching romance, a unique combination that ends up working, due in no small part to the sincerity of all involved. I did not expect to buy Christopher Reeve in such a role, yet he manages to be convincing, and, more surprising, develop a real chemistry with the angelic Jane Seymour. John Barrys tragically lovely score is, perhaps, the most timeless aspect. If theres a central weakness to the film, its in the lack of a deeper exploration of Reeves experience in the old world. He settles in a little too comfortably, and by extension, his romance with Seymour dodges numerous evocative ideas. Nevertheless, Somewhere In Time manages to succeed as a charming, heartfelt love story.",1416700800,,922,4.76875

1361145,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere In Time tells a story of Richard Collier,a playwright who was approached by an elderly woman on the occasion of his first triumph in 1972 -- all she says to him is ""Come back to me"" and leaves him with a watch. Eight years later, he visits the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island and comes upon a photograph of the same woman and your guess is as good as mine if you are reading this review. LOL

This film is a love story that the viewer may find themselves in sympathy and empathy with the lead protagonist or better yet lovers of the story. Credit Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for their wonderful performance as they definitely would deliver this type of a movie that will serve the hopeless romantics rather than the cynics. That is probably one reason why the story remains a cult classic after all these years despite not doing well during its theatrical release.",1413158400,,880,4.534591194968553
1361164,5,B00004W46I,"Based on the book ""Bid Time Return"" by author Richard Matheson, ""Somewhere in Time is a sweeping, sad, and beautiful movie about soul mates, time travel, and the things we do for love.

This touching movie came out in 1980, starring the beautiful Jane Seymore as Elise McKenna, a talented stage actress, and Christopher Reeve as Richard Collier, the playwright who loves her.

As the movie opens, Richard is a student at Millfield College in Chicago and he is celebrating the opening night of his first play, a happy success that might just be Broadway bound. Surrounded by critics, actors and friends, Richard is incredibly surprised when he is approached by an elegant elderly woman who looks at him intensely, puts an ornate pocket watch in his hand, and says, ""Come back to me!"" before walking away.

Eight years later, he is still carrying the pocket watch and has written several successful plays. Following a break-up with his girlfriend, he heads to The Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan as if he's following a mysterious star. As he is waiting for the dining room to open for dinner, he wanders into the Hall of History, and comes across the picture that changes his life forever.

If you have seen this movie already, you owe it to yourself to see it again. If you have never seen it and you are a lover of romance, then what are you waiting for?

The music alone - from Rachmaninoff's ""Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini"" to the Somewhere in Time Theme Song - is completely exquisite. The scenery is lovely and the hotel is beautiful and since it is an actual place, you may even get the chance to visit it someday.

There are many subtle, sweet, and interesting things to watch for and to ponder. Watch closely in the opening scene and you might catch the very young William H. Macy speaking his one line. Keep an eye out for Arthur, the bellboy at the hotel - and the absolutely adorable little boy he once was. And ponder, for a moment or two, just how old you think that pocket watch might truly be and how many loops through time it has traveled. That thing is even more durable than a Timex!

I love so many things about this movie. I love the clothing everyone wears. I love how people tease Richard about his completely out of style suit. I love when Elise firmly states that she is ""not a doormat - do not attempt to wipe your boots on me!""

Most of all, I love the way this movie makes my heart swell as I am swept away by the music and the beauty, laughing at one moment and crying the next. Make sure you watch this one with some tissues close at hand!",1413158400,,2579,4.437632135306554

Chris Reeve is such a pleasure to spend time with. And this is his film, to absolute perfection.

See it again. Chances are it's as good as you remember, and more. The concept of voluntary time travel being possible within the specific confines and eras of an old place that has changed little over the years remains seductively appealing, the notion of the past and present coexisting in the same rooms and halls retains its magical attraction.

Great film. I wonder if they knew at the time they were making a Classic. See it again, and enjoy.

1361217,2,B00004W46I,"WARNING:  Contains spoilers.

I'll come out and admit it -- I'm not a huge romance fan.  I don't mind a romance being part of a larger story, but I don't watch many actual romance films.  They tend to be too sappy, maudlin, and boring for my tastes.  There are exceptions -- I love ""Ever After,"" ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" ""The Wedding Singer,"" and ""Runaway Bride"" -- but often because there's a clever story or humor accompanying the romance.  If a movie has nothing else to offer aside from two people falling in love and making goo-goo eyes at each other, I'm bound to tune out.  But a relative recommended ""Somewhere in Time"" to me, and upon discovering that the central premise hinged on time travel, I bit.  If the romance turned out to be boring, I could at least enjoy time-travel shenanigans, right?

Sadly, this film has nothing to offer a non-romance fan, and precious little even for romance fans.  It's dull, contains a number of plot holes, and will disappoint anyone excepting there to be some actual logic behind the time travel elements.

""Somewhere in Time"" follows Richard Collier, a playwright living in 1980s Chicago and suffering from both depression and a bad case of writer's block.  Recalling a memorable encounter years ago with an old woman who gave him a pocket watch and pleaded for him to ""come back to me,"" he checks into the Grand Hotel, an old hotel on Lake Michigan, and discovers photographs of a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna... the same woman who gave him the watch.  He pieces together her life story, and upon discovering a book about time travel in her personal effects -- and his signature, dated 1912, in the hotel's register -- he decides he's going to take the plunge and travel back in time to 1912 to be with Elise.  The two quickly hit it off... but Elise's manager wants to see her become a star and not be tied down by a romance, and he'll do whatever he can to get between the two.

Time travel stories are typically full of paradoxes and time loops, and have to handwave whatever technology or anomaly is being used to go backward or forward in time.  ""Somewhere in Time"" is worse than most, however.  How is it that Elise knew Richard was coming when they'd never met before 1912?  If Elise gave younger Richard the pocket watch, and he in turn gave it to her in 1912 for her to give back to him, where did the freaking watch come from?  And the method of time travel used -- self-hypnosis -- is ridiculous.  So basically Richard goes from 1980 to 1912 just by wishing really hard?  I suppose the method of time travel wasn't considered important to a romance story, but I would have appreciated some actual effort beyond ""wishing yourself back in time.""

The acting in this film is pretty wooden.  I understand that Christopher Reeve was a celebrated actor, one who would later gain a sort of immortality by playing Superman, but he's stiff and dull in this film.  Jane Seymour is little more than a pretty face, putting little effort into her lines or performance.  Christopher Plummer, while another highly respected actor, seems wasted here.

The saving grace of this movie is that the location is beautiful, and it does capture the feel of three different time periods ('70s, early '80s, and '10s) quite well.  I understand the Grand Hotel is an actual place, and that it saw an upsurge in popularity after this film came out.  That's good for the hotel, but it's unfortunate that such a lackluster film is attached to it.

Perhaps this film has its own fans, but I personally found it boring.  And if you like time travel movies at all, this one will only bore and annoy you.",1405987200,5,3642,4.584234930448223

1361227,5,B00004W46I,"A lot of people I know have told me how this movie is really good, so I watched it last night and I was not disappointed, at all. Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour put on an excellent performance as two lovers from different time periods, Reeve being from 1978 and Seymour from 1912. Being a guy I enjoyed this movie not only because the great acting, but because of the story.

It makes you think how far would you go? (even through time if possible?) to find that special someone that you have been waiting for all of your life? These questions were answered in my mind while watching the movie last night.

Richard Collier, a man who is down in the dumps because of his career as a play writer goes on vacation to a really fancy hotel to take a break. While there, he finds a picture of a beautiful woman, and falls madly in love with it. He goes all out to find as much as he can about her to the point where he travels back in time just to find and be with her. Now some people would call that ""Stocking"" or an ""Obsession"" but the passion Richard displays of ""just wanting to be with her"" is very romantic and exciting, his determination to find her and get to know her more is really cool and in my book, very romantic.

I would say this is a very passionate, very romantic film about a man who stops at nothing to find a woman in the past, who he thinks the world of and loves like no other. This film is not like the cheesy, sick, teenage romantic garbage you find these days, it is an older film, but that should not stop you from enjoying it's great story. And it's romance is innocent and pure, true romance.

This film deserves five stars to me because it is one of those movies that makes you feel it's passion and romance, at the end of the film I was crying, literally, it made me feel so much. I also like the time traveling. I wish they would make more movies like this nowadays. I had my disagreements though, I did not like the end of the film, and what Richard does. But, that is part of the passion in the film. The stars Reeve and Seymour should do more films, I have seen Jane Seymour on TV but not in actual films these days, both are wonderful actors.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good old fashioned love story, my advice and I wish I would have done this is bring someone special to watch it with you, a wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband and enjoy it, you don't find romance like this these days. Enjoy the passion and romance. :)",1405036800,,2484,4.19916142557652

1361238,5,B00004W46I,"This film is all Jane Seymour, an actress I have always adored.  Her co-star in this wonderful film is Christopher Reeve, an actor I have always preferred to ignore!  Yes, I know he is handsome and a rather large man with a wonderful physique, however, his performances have been all too wooden for my taste. I see him as a very nice looking nerd who is not at all nuanced, shaded or one who uses subtleties in his work.  Ms. Seymour is, quite simply, a vision of loveliness and a woman most men can only dream of. I believe Ms. Seymour is not only at her most beautiful in this film but, as an actress, totally in her element.  The setting is pure old school grandeur and uses the magnificent Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan as its setting.  The hotel and grounds are nothing short of perfect for the premise and purpose of this film. A current day playwright, Richard Collier, is celebrating his success as a playwright and is taken aback when a very old woman approaches him. She says only four words to him...""Come back to me!"" presses a beautiful gold pocket watch into his hand and then, she is gone.  He has no idea who she is or what it is she is referring to at that moment!  Some years go by and his success has both exhausted and given him a severe case of writer's block. Deadlines are fast approaching and he decides to flee the city and give his mind a well needed rest.  He heads out in his car to points unknown and along the road he sees a sign for the very beautiful and storied Grand Hotel.  He decides to stop there...at least for the night.  After registering, and having little to do, he goes about the hotel and discovers a room off the lobby which is set up as a memorial to the great plays of yesteryear once performed there. It seems the hotel once had a theater that was very popular in its day and a portrait of the actress around whom this display is geared is on the far wall. As he walks toward it, a bright, white shard of light engulfs the photograph and, as if through a fog, is instantly mesmerized and drawn to her. Richard is transfixed...stunned and supremely enrapt by this visage of exquisite beauty. He looks around at all the artifacts preserved there trying to discover who she is and is suddenly stopped in his tracks as he comes across another photograph of someone he recognizes!  It is the old woman who approached him that night so many years ago and it is attached to the obituary of the actress whose portrait is on that wall. The beautiful woman in the portrait and the older woman are one and the same person...Elise McKenna...who had died later on very night she had spoken to him!  He locates the Bellman he had met upon registering at the hotel and begins to ask questions about her, why this room has so much significance and what it's all about.  Having grown up in the hotel himself, he begins to tell him of the stage actress, Elise McKenna, explaining who she was and what she meant to the era and the hotel itself.  He tells him that the actresses friend and companion, played by Teresa Wright (!), is still alive and living nearby.  Collier decides to pay her a visit to see what else he can discover, and when he does the woman is a bit reticent in revealing too much about her until he shows her the watch he has in his pocket!  What ensues is the stuff great stories are made of and the point of this entire movie.  It is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever witnessed on film...buy it, see it and treasure it...and when you find a day in which you are doubtful and think nothing is possible...see it again.

After seeing it again last night and listening to a portion of the Special Features, I was drawn to the gentleman who has been instrumental in preserving, not only the film, but its timeless message and meaning.  I discovered that about 50% of people who say they love this film happen to be men.  Shocking, indeed!  Although not typically a ""Chick Flick"" by virtue of the way in which the subject was approached and filmed, I should have thought most men would not be so disposed!  It is, after all, a love story...and what a love story but with nothing steamy, seedy or profane.  I began to wonder what this seemingly universal appeal is really made of. What makes this, above all of the greatest love stories ever filmed, resonate so with men and women alike?  I have to come down to two words that recur again and again in my mind....simplicity and hope! This outlandish story of time travel and of love fulfilled and yet unfulfilled is one of simple beauty in which we are not asked to suspend our belief systems.  We are asked to hope it is so! Neither the screen writers or the director made a soap opera of this story.  They simply made it possible for you to imagine it can happen and did happen for this man, Richard Collier. It asks nothing of you other than that and if you can enter into the world of dreams, which is, in and of itself, a land of hope...you will, quite simply, adore this film. During the reunion of Elise and Richard, the film allows us to hope we too, can possibly reconnect with that one love in our lives that outshines and eclipses all others. To go back and write another chapter in our book of life and perhaps find the mate that we were created for. Oh, yes...we hope it can be! The final aspect again involves hope.  Many religions on our planet speak of heaven and the glory we will see there.  We mortals, have no idea what heaven is, but we have envisioned ourselves, perhaps, floating through peaceful scenes, rich in splendor and reuniting with loved ones who have gone before us.  How will we meet these loved ones when that moment comes?  As children, young adults, parents or as elderly and infirm as we were when we passed on?  I believe we see ourselves at our own optimum moments in time and that we will present in heaven as the best we were in life...perhaps even at different ages depending on who we meet!  There are many scenarios we can imagine, however, none of them involve a block party that will include everyone we ever knew! Perhaps this can only happen once...once in life and once after death!  Who really knows? In our hearts we harbor secret wishes.  Each of us has, I believe, a desire to, once again, connect with someone we truly loved or were loved by in life.  There are, almost certainly, more than one person that fits that bill!  With this film, we are not urged to believe, not coerced or forced to, in any way, to believe anything. Therefore, we have nothing to stop us from simply hoping it can all be so.  It's what we need and it is, perhaps what we want as well.  To enter freely into a state of something so sublime...without drugs, machinery, hypnotic suggestion or any external stimuli and to come out the other end being richer and better for it. I'll take it...any day in any way.  All I can add is this....It is August 1966...I am here, at home...",1401580800,,6931,4.380952380952381

1361242,5,B00004W46I,Got it for my dad. He saw it years ago on TV then we rented it when we had a VCR. It was on TV a times in the 1980s. I was looking for DVDs for him and saw this and had to get it for him. He loves the music and the story line. And who doesn't like Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve.,1399852800,,283,3.4375
1361243,5,B00004W46I,"To be honest, I had never heard of this movie, and I became interested in it while taking vacations to Mackinaw Island where it was filmed.  I had no idea the movie had such a devoted following (although from reading these reviews, it seems one may either love or hate it.)

I loved the movie!  It has such a simple, understated beauty. Christopher Reeve at his best, smitten, awkward and funny. Jane Seymour DOING what she does best, romance, heartfelt and elusive. I was shocked to see critics had panned this, it is such a sweet film.

The plot line is intriguing. A guy becomes obsessed with a woman's picture, so much so that he longs to travel back in time and meet her. I love time travel journeys and this does not disappoint.  No big special effects, no Holly-weird extravaganza, this film relies on the chemistry of Reeve and Seymour.  The costumes and set are beautiful, the lovemaking is beautiful. Although I am not a prude by any means, it was nice to see  subtlety with much left to the imagination.  Probably a great film for Valentine's Day. And not just  a chick flick, I hear men like it too.  Also, check out the spooky interview with Reeve as he talks of his later 'out of body' experience, eerily in synch with this story!  GREAT movie.",1398556800,,1258,4.497797356828194
1361244,5,B00004W46I,"You will love this film.  Christopher Plummer is great as the ""agent"" and guard of the very successful Elise Makenna. Jane Seymour plays this theater actress so well.  Christopher Reeve is excellent as a man captivated so much by the woman's mere photo and his passion for this actress makes him want to go absolutely anywhere to meet her and this  drives the story. She and Christopher Reeve have great chemistry and the location is also irresistible as much of the film was shot on location at the Grand Hotel in Michigan on Mackinac Island.

Christopher Reeve is wonderful in this movie....he is at once romantic and pathetic (and I say that with all due respect). Is time travel really possible?

This is a true romance story..one of the best, and the music is wonderful lending to the romantic atmosphere. I really do love this film, but if I were you I wouldn't think about the concepts used in this movie to get Reeve's character back and forth in time. Nor would I try to figure how the old lady got to be old and how did he get to be young...again. It all kinda evens itself out in the final scene however.

A bit slow at times, with one of the most depressing endings ever, as a healthy Christopher Reeve wills himself to death to be reunited with his ""soul-mate"" Jane Seymour. Christopher Plummer's worst performance ever, even surpassing that ""Star Trek"" movie.  Critics disagree, but I believe it to be Christopher Reeve's most sincere and best performance on film. Even beats ""Superman"".  Mackinaw Island and The Grand Hotel are magnificently represented. The first half of the film is boring for the most part and the last half is too short and truly magical.

1361324,3,B00004W46I,"I think this film tries to convey an impression/feeling rather than be very realistic or even consistently logical. It appeals to the emotions rather than to the intellect. It's a love story/fantasy with a slight science-fiction-like detail (time travel into the early 1900s... without the aid of technology!). The story setting of the somewhat distant past also adds an element of nostalgia. Another big aspect that some viewers might be skeptical of is the love-at-first-sight phenomenon which is probably a most crucial leap-of-faith near the beginning of the movie, when Richard Collier becomes fixated with seeking the long deceased actress Elise McKenna after merely seeing her photo on the wall of a hotel's history museum, seemingly for the first time in his life. I think it would be difficult to explain Richard's sudden maniacal obsession with Elise upon exposure, except to hypothesize that somehow he 'recognized' [both the hotel and] the photo of the actress. Perhaps [Freudian] psychologists would say he saw qualities of his own mother in Elise but did not realize this fully consciously, so it remained as this mysterious fascination which he could not explain. Possibly a more profound and more complete explanation might lie in the idea of past lives, which assumes reincarnation to be a reality. That is, Richard Collier must have spent a previous life/lives with Elise in a very close relationship. This subconscious partial 'bleed-through' of buried memories, into the conscious mind, is how I would explain and connect the phenomena of love-at-first-sight, nostalgia (i.e. remembering a place one would call 'home') and deja vu ('this has happened [to me] before'). Robert Monroe, the businessman who became adept at out-of-body travel, wrote in one of his books on the subject, that nostalgia is actually a remembrance of one's non-earthly origins, i.e. one's spiritual birthplace, rather than one's physical home in one's current lifetime. Another paranormal concept in the movie is that R.F. Robinson, Elise's manager, displays some precognitive ability, in fact predicting Collier's initial meeting with McKenna. before the event occurs.",1382486400,,2164,5.405325443786983

1361378,5,B00004W46I,"I remember the first time I saw this movie back in the early 80's. I had not seen it in the theaters, or remember ever hearing about it, or for a couple years after that even. I first saw this movie when it came out on VHS. I guess I didn't know what to expect, but it looked good so I rented it. I have always been a mushy fan of love stories that goes way back to when I was a young teenager (in love with love). I had worked in movie theaters when I was in college part time, so I got to see a lot of movies, especially film festivals of the older films where romantic movies were always mushy, like for instance Bette Davis in 'Now, Voyager'.

When I sat down to watch the movie, it enthralled me. First the idea of time travel. I won't say how many times I dreamt of moving in time...even romantically and this movie fit the bill. I was always so angry with the reviewers for panning this movie so badly! After doing Superman, which was cheesy in its own way, I guess they expected another box office action smash hit and they were let down with a 'love story'! I always said that the reviewers of films had seen so many that they would knit pick everything they could when reviewing a movie. It was then that I lost all faith in reviewers because they made a flop out of 'Somewhere in Time' when it could have had a good opening. I know this also because at the time, I knew Christopher Reeves from a business that I worked at and he was so excited about what we all thought of Superman, yet unless you said something about this movie, he never said anything. When I told him that I adored the movie, he was surprised...and I guess it was because of all the panning he got when it opened, he knew the critics had tore it apart, and that was a shame! He was happy to hear how much I loved it and asked me why...and I told him.

To move on, besides romance, fantasy was my other favorite topic and when I have read (a dozen times) 'Time and again', I was utterly fascinated being a NY'er and hearing how NY was back in the 1880's when someone finds a way to go back in time. Or like the most recent one ""Kate and Leopold', which had a time travel-love thing going on, but in reverse. Put them both together in a film like this, and I am utterly enthralled. I don't know how many times I have seen it (stopped counting) I used to tell anyone I could who I know would like it, that they watch it and wouldn't be sorry. Almost everyone I told loved it when they had seen it, which is why I think the critics destroyed the movie. Just like Jeff Shannon's review, they can forgive many things in films they like and tell us to over look it for the main content of the film. But when it comes to this one, they ignore a WHOLE LOT of people who tell them otherwise and still pan the movie after all these years.

I have owned this movie on VHS, laser disc and finally DVD. I always have to have it near so when I get the urge to watch something so positively romantic, I have it to watch. No matter how many times I have seen this movie, I never get tired of it. It is so totally romantic and tragic at the same time. You're happy when he does make it back in time (and before he makes it sees his name in the register to prove he made it...and the part where he has to sign it at just the right place as he saw it in the future. I've always wondered why I so loved this movie and found out that, just like in the movie, love conquers all, but most times in death. Maybe that was what made this movie so real to me. It wasn't just a mushy love story with a 'happily ever after' ending but only in his death were they reunited. But I guess also I had always wished someone would love me so deeply that nothing else mattered was always an altruistic dream of mine.

Like it or not critics...this movie put a big pie in your face for your bad reviews and has made more money on video than it did at the box office should have woken you up. I guess it did since I bought it 3 times and now maybe a 4th with the special documentary on their look back featurette. And I can say that there are plenty of people out there like me who have done the same and spent money countless times on 'such a panned movie'...so much for reviews and great job people who made this rank so high in the video charts :-)",1366156800,3,4292,4.039952996474736

I liked the scene where Jane Seymour and Reeves were sitting looking out across the water with the old red lighthouse in the background. My late wife and I had sat at that same spot many times on our visits up to Northern Michigan.

1361404,1,B00004W46I,"No, not a book called ""Somewhere in Time"", but ""Time and Again"" by Jack Finney, from whose theories it strongly and inappropriately borrows.  Finney's book details how its hero transitions from the present to the past as a scientific project, relying more on historical inter weavings than plot.  ""Somewhere in Time"", using Finney's devices unembarassedly, is a simple love story, and ultimately much less effective.

Reeve falls in love with a photograph of a beautiful performer (Seymour), hanging on the wall of a 19th century hotel he accidentally visits.  Determined to find the object of his love in the flesh, he sequesters himself in a room in the hotel, recreating the circumstances and environment of the 1890's.  Just as it does in the novel it stole from, this ploy works, and the hero finds himself in the presence of the woman he loves.

So far so good.  Then the bottom drops out.  In brief, there's really no story here; mutual love is immediate, threatened only by a sinister manager who is determined to destroy the relationship between the actress and the hero.  This all goes absolutely nowhere, and despite the sincere efforts of the cast, it's fluffy and insignificant in the worst sense of the world.

This is a deliberate tear-jerker, not only because these lovers are torn apart by a simple oversight on the part of the hero, but because, for no particular reason unable to to travel back in time and find his lover again,  he just gives up.  Wanna feel emotionally ripped off?  Then this is the movie for you.",1360454400,8,1535,4.7908745247148286

1361407,3,B00004W46I,"I've heard so much over the years about this film being a romantic classic that I finally had to watch it. I'm a fan of sappy romances so I really wanted to love this movie, unfortunately the lackluster acting on Reeves' part, and the writing killed what could have been a fantastic film.

Some reviewers complain about holes in the film. Any movie with a sci-fi element requires you to suspend disbelief, so his mode of going back in time, where the watch came from and other minutiae didn't bother me as much as the the substance of the film.

To me the biggest hole was the dignified Elise falling for the somewhat goofy Richard. Yes, we know Richard fell in love with her photo, but the film would have been more believable if we learned what made Elise fall so hard for a guy who was essentially a stalker from the future.  The development of their love should have been THE focus of the film, but it was glossed over in an afternoon walk that took up all of five minutes of the movie.

The pat ending was also hard to swallow.  One of my all time favorite romances, Wuthering Heights, had a similar ending. But because that film dwelled on the development of the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy it seemed like a suitable climax. Here it plain falls flat.

This is not an awful movie. It is beautifully filmed and scored. Seymour is a classic beauty and she and Plummer are fine actors who did well in their roles. It was nice to see the great Theresa Wright in a cameo.  I do understand why so many people have such regard for this movie. The idea of a love so strong it transcends time is an appealing one. Too bad this was mediocrely executed. If I want to watch a sappy romance I think I'll stick with Wuthering Heights, The Princess Bride, The Shop Around the Corner or An Affair to Remember.",1359849600,,1812,4.391044776119403

The film differs in numerous points from the novels.  Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour were perfectly cast as Richard Collier and Elise McKenna, and the film location was also ideal. Christopher Plummer played McKenna's controlling manager with skill. Filmed on a small budget and released in 1980, the film nevertheless carries everyone but the most jaded along for a wonderful experience.

Budget limitations are evident in the DVD which only has mono audio! Fans have waited years for this to be remastered and brought out on Blu-ray.  Still, the DVD can be purchased on Amazon.com for under $8.00 and on a Blu-ray player with DVD upscaling capability, the images is quite good.

The story is timeless (no pun intended) and man it makes you wish it was possible. The way he looks at her and the way he kisses her.....holy hell lol. It changes you and makes you really think about life, love and chance. And it is funny too. Reeves gives his character such heart and you are cheering for him through it all.

1361467,5,B00004W46I,"Okay, I really hate Nicholas Sparks movies and this one kinda feels like one.  Not a fan of syrupy romance.  I NEED comic relief.  So I didn't really think I'd like this movie.

But I am a fan of time travel.

And I'm in love with Christopher Reeve.

I might also be a little obsessed with Jane Seymour. (Can't believe I paid $90 a season for Dr. Quinn, but ... I couldn't wait that long.)

I kept catching a sappy grin on my face during their scenes together.  Syrupy was really working for me in this movie.  Or maybe I was just waiting for Superman to show up...

The comic relief was definitely there, though.  I love the boyish grin Christopher Reeve gets when he's discovering he has a new crush, or in this case, that he's really about to meet the girl of his dreams.  It's kind-of a girlish thing that resembles biting your fingernails.  No other way to describe it - for girls or for Superman - except ""cute.""  He does it in Superman when he's interviewing with Lois Lane on the roof of her building.  I caught it again in this movie, I think maybe when he's checking into the hotel.  I'll be able to describe it better after I've seen THIS movie 100 times.  Some more comic relief when he's teasing Miss McKenna while trying to convince her to walk with him later.  And more still when he's talking about his goof in costuming.  In this case, comic relief=innocently charming instead of ""smooth"" like we usually see in more recent films.

There's definitely some dumb stuff going on in this movie too.  The time travel theory was so ridiculous.  I'm thinking a hot tub would have been a more believable choice.  I won't go into what his facial expressions were really saying while he was wishing himself into the past.  Let's just say he looked like he was having more than a little fun with all his hard wishing.

I wanted to throw something at the librarian who was too busy to pull his old magazines for him (oh yeah, I'd rather file cards in the card catalog than pull magazines for Superman.  Doesn't she know in 20 years, that card catalog will be repurposed as a jewelry cabinet in someone's living room?)

And then there's shirtless Christopher Reeve.  'Nuff said.",1343952000,,2210,4.496221662468514
1361468,5,B00004W46I,"I love this film and find the premise very close to that of Jack Finney's Time After Time, though this is a better love story.  People have said enough--obviously one loves or hates it; who knows why.  So all I want to add, if no one has mentioned it already (I confess to not having read all the reviews)is the paradox of the watch.  She gives it to him when she's an old Lady, on the very night she dies.  He keeps it for ten years or so, then travels back in time, and leaves it with her.  The watch is caught in an endless time loop: she keeps it all her life waiting for him to be born so she can give him the watch which he will bring back in time to her.  SO WHO MANUFACTURED THE WATCH!  It clearly has no history outside of the time loop.  I don't raise the point as an objection, but more in the spirit of Star Trek Time Paradoxes.

On another note, I met a gentleman the other day who told me that the idea for the novel was based upon the author's own infatuation with actress Maude Adams, and a fantasy that he could travel back in time to meet her.  I plan to research this idea, and Ms. Adam's career, more thoroughly and will get back to you when I know more.

1361473,4,B00004W46I,"A very pretty movie. I don't pretend to understand it, not really, but it's a love story and a time travel story.

Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) was a beginning playwright in 1972, and had just written a very good play that was produced at his college, and being scouted for a possible run on Broadway. Suddenly, a very dignified old lady walks out of the shadows, hands him a gift, and whispers to him ""Come back to me."" The gift is an old-fashioned gold watch.

Eight years later, he's a successful playwright being pressured by his agent for the play he said he was writing, and decides to go to the Grand Hotel, the fine old resort near where he went to college. When it turns out he has some time to kill before the dining room opens, he goes into a little museum room the hotel maintains. There on the wall, in an ornate frame, is a photograph of Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) that mesmerizes him. So instead of going back to the city, he stays at the Grand and researches Miss McKenna. Turns out she was a famous actress who had played there in 1912. She went on to have a great career, but she was new and not much known at that time.

I won't detail the mechanism, but Collier manages to travel back in time to 1912, still at the Grand Hotel, and meets Elise. They fall in love. Of course he never told her he was from the future, and indeed subsequent events suggest he did not know it during that time.

But William Robinson (Christopher Plummer), her manager, knows something. And has prophesied that some day she will meet a man who changes her life. So when she meets Collier, she says ""Is it you?"" And while she may or may not recognize him, he recognizes her, and says ""Yes.""

There are many charming touches, the costumes and sets are marvelous, and it's basically a love story with a unique twist. One important twist is how he ended up returning to the present time. So I won't spoil that for you.

BTW, Christopher Reeve really was a very handsome, very competent actor in those days. Makes it all the more tragic what happened to him later.",1336780800,,2066,4.395287958115183

1361476,5,B00004W46I,"Raindrops fall from the heavens upon the classic, genteel romance ""Somewhere In Time."" Within the `lover's pianissimo"" storyline, love unfolds, passion envelopes, and intimacy closes upon us with force and fire from within. We observe Richard Collier (played with nuance by Christopher Reeve) going back in time to pursue a woman from another era (Elise McKenna, played with beauty and grace by Jane Seymour and in more advanced years played by the esteemed actress Teresa Wright). We do not know exactly how it is possible (time travel) but we accept the premise out of affection for this genre. If  Richard has wings into eternity so do we. If he can transport himself back in time, so can we. Afterall we are investing ourselves in a high romance. It is high tide or nothing: once we are consumed with the rich themes ever present in this high-end drama.

All becomes secondary: we look only to the moment his eyes meet hers; when she - the softer one - acknowledges his gentleness on her behalf, and invites him to continue in his mannerisms, that are affecting her sensibilities (more than he might know); Elise commands the stage (literally and figuratively) when it comes to romantic interludes. It is she who knows the nuances and somber qualities of a strong or weak interlude, starting from the time he advances his masculine qualities upon her own - to the time he withdraws aspects of his person, to allow her to present aspects of her person. Her emotions persuade us to remain by her side, no matter what separates her from her chosen lover. Her depth elevates our empathy.

Of course, we know the strength of Richard lies in his grasp of those subtleties. Story truth: Elise's passion will not subside. It is a foregone conclusion. We acquiesce to her intense love for Richard from `Somewhere In Time' other than her own. He will come back to her or she will go to him. We bond with her easily once she states her desire on stage in front of a packed audience, in the now famous soliloquy by Jane Seymour. Perhaps this is the hidden rapture within the storyline. Our heroine will not allow `unfinished love' to remain constant in her life; she will find a way to reunite with her departed paramour. Highly recommend this historical romance. Directed by Jeannot Szwarc; written by Richard Matheson; music composed by John Barry (a now famous soundtrack); stunning cinematography by Isidore Mankofsky; filmed at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan, where Seymour and others in the cast gather on this movie's anniversary dates.",1334448000,,2551,4.819634703196347

1361479,5,B00004W46I,"It's a shame that such a beautiful film like Somewhere in Time has to be cut down to a demeaning, sexist review by Jeff Shannon.  What exactly does he mean when he says ""face it guys- it'll make the wives and girlfriends swoon if they're in a romantic mood?"" I'm paraphrasing, but that's pretty much the gist of the the last line of the review.

It would help if some movie critics could get their facts straight. There is a Somewhere in Time fan club called INSITE in which 50% of the members are men, which disproves Mr. Shannon's sexist notion that only women can like this movie-or any romantic film, for that matter.

Sexist statements that are not based on facts are not only foolish, they are narrow-minded, piggish, and immature.  Alas, it is not the fault of the filmmakers that some critics have to stoop so low in a pathetic attempt at being humorous.  Somewhere in Time is a timeless classic that is, to this day, attracting new fans.  This can be proven by a music video of the film, which was created by a 16 year old MAN for YouTube, just a couple of years ago.

The fact that Mr. Shannon didn't think much of the film is immaterial to me, because one can like or dislike a film as one sees fit.  It was the last line of the review that irritated me.  To somehow imply that a film is inferior because of its supposed appeal only to women is an attitude that I've seen from too many male critics, and it's an attitude that male critics need to get over BIG TIME!",1324944000,4,1476,4.299638989169675

1361495,5,B00004W46I,"This may qualify as one of the original 'chick flicks' but there is something wonderful about this movie.

To break this down into big parts before putting them back together again, you have a handsome leading man, you have Jane Seymour who is, in my opinion, at the zenith of her beauty in this movie, you have a gorgeous old hotel from an era long since past and you have a lovestory that defies time.

Now, to put the pieces back together again, you have our hero, Peter Collier/Chris Reeves, who is celebrating the opening night of his very first play with all his college friends and family around him, and gliding out of the shadows is a delicate, fragile old woman in a black Victorian gown with her platinum hair swept up into a period hairstyle and she goes to Peter and touches his shoulder.  He turns to her and is startled to see a woman who he not only doesn't know but also clearly doesn't belong in the group surrounding him.

She gazes at him for a moment and everything goes silent as he stares at her, not sure what to do, then she says to him, 'Come back to me,' and places a gold pocket watch in his hand, curls his fingers around it and then glides back into the shadows, leaving everyone stunned.  When his friends ask Peter who she was he admits that he has no idea who she was and then looks at the pocket watch in amazement because he can tell it's an antique.

We then see him in his apartment years later, reviews and accolades framed on the walls while he deals with a case of writer's block and decides he needs to get out of town to clear his head.  He hops in his little Triump Spitfire and tools off into the countryside away from the city and happens to drive past The Grand Hotel  which is actually a place you can visit and apparently people make 'pilgrimages' there because of this movie  then thinks better of it and goes zipping up to get himself a room.

While he waits for a room to be readied, he wanders around taking in the beauty of the hotel and wanders into a room that is dedicated to the history of the hotel and as he walks in he catches a glimpse of this most gorgeous woman gazing at him as he walks through a shaft of sunlight coming through the window, momentarily blinding him until he walks through it and realizes that the woman he saw was actually a photo mounted on the far wall.  He goes to it, transfixed by the woman's beauty and the expression on her face and finds that the nameplate is missing from the photo.

Completely intrigued, he asks the bellman about the photo and he learns that she was an actress, a very well known and acclaimed actress named Elise McKenna who had performed at the small theater along the lake of the hotel's grounds.

What follows is a detective story of sorts, because as Peter learns more about Elise, he discovers that it was she who came to him that night at the theater when his first play was performed and gave him the watch, dying that very night after she left him with that one entreaty.

He discovers more clues that lead him to believe that he was, in fact, with her when she was young and is determined to find out how it happened, determined to find a way to make it happen, and when he does, he finds that Elise's manager is none too pleased to see this young man coming into her life and ruining all the well laid plans that he had made for her.

Despite the obstacles, they do manage to steal time to be together, get to know each other, fall in love with each other, and then Peter is thrown back to his own time.

While I have never really been overly impressed with Christopher Reeves' acting, I have to say that in the scene when he comes back and scrambles to return, finally realizing he going to be unable to get back to her, when he begins to weep with the loss of the love of his life, there is no way you cannot feel that pain with him and it never ceases to make me cry every time I see it.

The ending reminds me very much of the last scene of the original Wuthering Heights and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but this movie haunts you it's so good.  The music in this movie, especially the love theme, is exquisite and when it plays while the two are together, just looking at each other as they discover and learn about each other, it just makes your heart ache in the best, most bittersweet way.

1361517,3,B00004W46I,"So much has already been written about the plot, etc. by other reviewers that I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...

Somebody I know ranks this as his third favorite movie of all time, so I was curious to see it.  I had never seen it until several months ago.  This movie was released in 1980 and basically was a box office bomb.  I guess it got buried by The Blues Brothers, which was released the same week.  This movie has gained in stature in the decades since its release.  It now has a cult following.  Basically it's a sappy love story with some supernatural elements and/or science fiction thrown in the mix (example -- traveling through time).  The movie is very slow moving, soft, tender, and sappy, but it did hold my attention somewhat.  This movie stars Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Teresa Wright.  Reeve acts very much like he does when he played Clark Kent/Superman in the Superman movies.  I don't know if was intentional or not, but it's Reeve as most people know him.  Jane Seymour looks good and her acting is good.  The musical score by John Barry (King Kong 1976) is a big plus and it's quite good.  The screenplay was written by Richard Matheson (The Legend Of Hell House) and it was well done.

When it comes to movies that fall into the love story category, I like to draw the line somewhere.  I like such ""love story"" or ""romance"" movies as Vertigo (1958), Notorious (1946), Rebecca (1940), Humoresque (1946), Rear Window (1954), Marnie (1964), Titanic (1997), etc. (I can give many other examples), BUT these movies have additional aspects about them that make them more watchable and appealing to me.  For example, Vertigo is quite a dark, haunting, and suspenseful romance story.  Notorious is dark, suspenseful, and the love story doesn't make up the entire plot, in other words, it's a subplot.  Rebecca is very gothic in feel and has the evil Mrs. Danvers.  Humoresque has a romance that is rocky from the start and never fully develops.  Rear Window is another movie that has a romance mixed in with a dark and suspenseful story.  Marnie has a plot that's centered around a woman with psychological problems, while her boss TRIES to romance her.  Titanic has a love story mixed in with the sinking of the ship, a sad and tragic event.  I guess I like seeing romance movies when the romance is mixed in with a dark and suspenseful plot.  I like dark and suspenseful movies and horror movies.  Just my taste, I guess.  Somewhere In Time, on the other hand, is pretty much just a straight romance movie.  It's a little too sappy, soft, and tender for me.

Overall, an OK movie if you like your romance movies very soft, tender, played straight, and with little ""oomph"".  If you're like me, you prefer that your romance movies have more ""oomph"", darkness, and suspense.

UPDATE - I re-watched this movie in December 2012 and couldn't believe I originally gave it 3 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.  After this second viewing, I didn't like it nearly as much.  It was suddenly a borderline ridiculous movie!!!!  I kept thinking, ""What was I thinking?????""  So, I have taken a full star off my original rating.

I now give this movie 2 3/4 (2.75) stars, rounded up to 3.  That's more like it.",1311465600,3,3235,4.5926573426573425

1361544,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere In Time is refreshing in the way that it doesn't bash you over the head with lots of extreme special effects. It's also a movie that doesn't try to rely on cheap humor, gratuitous violence or graphic depictions of sex in order to get your attention. I especially appreciate the way the love scene was handled in this movie. In my opinion, it was romantic, sensual but yet still very discreet and old fashioned. Very reminiscent of the window scenes in ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Casablanca""

it's nice to leave a little something to the imagination sometimes, isn't it?

I thought the actors in SIT played their roles well and in a very believable way. Of course, I loved Jane Seymour in the role of the very elegant stage actress Elise McKenna, and Christopher Plummer was excellent in the role of her very controlling manager William Fawcett Robinson, but it was performance of the late Christopher Reeve as playwright Richard Collier that captured my heart and made me fall in love with this genre. Somewhere in Time was the perfect vehicle for Reeve...and as far as I am concerned, it was the best role he ever played.

The Mackinac Island scenery was beautiful, the soundtrack absolutely captivating (it's one I can listen to all the time without ever tiring of it), the dialogue was well written. It was an all around beautiful movie. To me, in spite of what some detractors say about perceived historical errors, alleged continuity mistakes and so- called ""plot holes"" Somewhere in Time is still a masterpiece! As far as I am concerned, it is still BETTER than Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, the 1997 version of Titanic or even Casablanca.

Why?

Because Somewhere in Time is more than just another light entertaining romantic comedy told from only a 21st century female point of view. It is rare to see a serious romantic movie that explores a masculine viewpoint of love and romance (Casablanca is a notable exception). What was really surprising to me is that this movie tends to attract a significant number of men who become die-hard fans! In fact, half of the membership of the fan club, International Network Of Somewhere In Time Enthusiasts (INSITE) are men. Not bad for a flicker that could've been labeled and blown off as just another ""chick's movie!""

Somewhere In Time appeals to the intellect as well as to the heart. I consider SIT a ""thinking person's"" movie because it is not a story that allows you to remain complacent in your beliefs. It shakes you up, makes you question things, requires you to take a leap of faith and suspend any pre-conceived notions about the many constructs one forms over the years about a variety of issues. SIT is a drama that brings to you an awareness of the possibility of time travel, an alternative universe and raises your consciousness of the spiritual as well as making you seriously consider the whole idea of whether everyone has a soul mate that is only separated from them by time and space...and whether we are truly controlled by our circumstances, and if we truly have the power to effect change in the way one witnesses in this movie. So is time travel possible? You can research it or you can just take that leap of faith and suspend disbelief while watching this movie. Reeve himself would tell us ""Nothing is impossible"" regarding his belief that he would walk again...in a sense, this movie demonstrated that belief many years before.

Whether you like the movie or not, watching it does cause one to think...and part of the reason for movies is to encourage learning, and to explore concepts as well as to entertain. I definitely consider this movie a must-see for the Romantic soul...with special emphasis on the documentary regarding the making of this movie. It has much to tell us and much to make us re-examine our entire concept of the time and space continuum, other laws of physics, philosophy, the supernatural, and yes, even our approaches to romance and love.

However, we were disappointed.  The film is extremely slow and parts of it make no sense.  Richard Collier travels in time by...a fantastic time machine?  A bolt of lightning?  No.  By HYPNOSIS...how pathetic is that?  He dresses up in old-time clothes and repeats ""I am in 1912,"" over like a zillion times, and BOOM-BAM, he travels in time!  And it just gets stupider.  He falls in love with the woman he thinks he knows (but we never figure out why or what actual time he's really from) after only being with her ONE DAY!  And this is the best part- he is tragically sent back to his own time when he opens his coat pocket and pulls out...A PENNY!  A PENNY FROM 1979, and he is magically whisked back to his own time!  Watch it if you don't believe me!  When he arrives back in his own time and can't return to be with his beloved, he tragically dies...but the good news is, he meets his loved one in heaven.  YAY!

The back story includes how Mathenson was actually inspired to write the novel by a lovely old photo of the beautiful turn of the last century stage actress, Maude Adams.

There's a great deal of information here.

For anyone that has not seen this movie, I say- rent a DVD and see it. It is a beautiful work of art.

I saw this movie almost 30 years ago when I was a college student and I saw it at the campus theatre. It made an impact on me because it was so beautiful and so tragic. I never forgot it. It was unusual to see 'Superman' Christopher Reeve in a romantic, emotional role. Everything is presented in a subtle way. Some may call it old fashioned. There is no violence, no sex, no nudity, and no special effects- yet it is very effective because it is handled so skillfully by the director.  The screenplay is wonderful. The main idea behind it is time travel, and it creates a circle. At the beginning, an old lady gives young Richard Collier an antique watch and says- ""come back to me"".  He does, after he sees her picture from her young days. They fall in love, but at the height of their happiness it is all taken away from them. I remember thinking at that time- I wish he had not looked at that 1979 coin; they could have lived happily ever after. What if he had stayed in 1912 and not returned to his present time (1980)? Then she would not have given him the watch. It is an interesting scenario, and one can go on imagining many different situations because of the time travel.

The acting is superb. There is great chemistry between the two main characters played by Reeve and Seymour. Reeve is enchanting as the young play wright who is grief stricken toward the end. Seymour captures the character of Elise very well, and she looks very beautiful. Christopher Plummer is very effective as the protective but controlling manager. 'Arthur' as a little boy and an old man (played by the recently deceased Bill Erwin) adds to the movie. The location (McKinaw island in Michigan) and the Grand Hotel provide an idyllic location for the romantic story.

Recently I bought the collectors edition of the DVD, and enjoyed it so much that I watched the movie 3 times in 2 days. I was surprised to hear that initially it was released in theatres for just 3 weeks, and that the critics slammed this movie, so it disappeared until it was resurrected on its 20th anniversary. The special features are interesting, with interviews with the actors, directors, photographer, etc. What I like about this movie is its lack of high tech effects. The focus is on the story, the characters, and the period atmosphere. It is one of my all time favorite movies. I feel fortunate that I got to see it in a theatre 30 years ago.

 The music (score by John Barry)is hauntingly beautiful. It uses Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a theme by Paganini almost throughout the movie and it is an integral part of the movie. So much so that every time I hear this music anywhere, I think- ""Somewhere in time"".

It is an unforgettable movie and one of my all time favorites.",1294012800,,2869,4.491362763915547
1361602,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere in Time was a complete failure at the box-office when originally released. However, I'd like to take a moment to compare this wonderful film to two other ""failures"" you may be familiar with...

In 1939, when the ""Wizard of Oz"" was initially released, it was considered a failure by MGM. It wasn't until 10 years later, when it was re-released in 1949, that MGM was pleased with the box-office profits. In later years, as movie fans all over the world discovered it on television, it went on to become one of the ""most watched films in history"" (according to the Library of Congress). Also, it's commonly listed as one of the top 10 best movies ever made.

also...

When ""Its a wonderful life"" was released in 1946/47 it was considered a major dissapointment and a box-office flop. Thanks to television, and video rentals, it's now recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 greatest films ever made, and is listed at number ONE on their list of the most inspirational films of all time.

Not bad for two ""failures""....huh?

Now, please understand that I'm not trying to elevate Somewhere in Time to the same ""legendary"" status as the aforementioned films, but it's not THAT different of a success story. And for that matter, from the perspective of storytelling, not that different as far as content as well.

Just like the Wizard of Oz, or It's a wonderful Life, Somewhere in Time mixes fantasy elements into a very simple plot structure. The result; a film that initially caused most viewers and critics to cry ""corny"" and ""cheese"". However, in later years, thanks to cable TV, VHS rentals, and now DVD, a HUGE fan base has appeared. It seems that all the jaded critics in the world couldn't destroy the simple magic found within this film!

We really do need a BLU-RAY release!

If you like this film, you might also enjoy another 80's classic ""The Boy Who Could Fly"". It's not quite as subtle, but it's also one of my favorites.

If trends in movies and TV shows are an accurate gauge of attitudes toward love, recent generations find immediate sex sensible but the waiting game of romance idiotic.  As a high school teacher and university instructor since two years after the release of Somewhere in Time, I have watched young people become less and less susceptible to the romantic sentiment on which films like this depend, not to mention the hundreds of other romantic classics from earlier decades, like The Apartment or Now, Voyager, which I mention specifically because they are gloriously romantic without the exchange of a single kiss at their crowning moments.  Even on broadcast TV, with whole families watching, many shows combine the first kiss, ravenous and visceral, with the rapid shedding of clothes.  Although Somewhere in Time contains a quasi-nude scene, and although I am a man who enjoys ""manly"" entertainments which most Somewhere in Time fans would not like at all, I am not ashamed to say that this movie is and has always been for me a kind of religious experience. (My sister, also a devotee, is one of the thousands who made the pilgrimage to the Grand Hotel.)  But it is pointless, for example, to ask a 25-year old incapable of feeling sentiment what he thinks of the score of Somewhere in Time, Barry and Rachmaninoff in excelsis, or whether he would sit in a hotel room, alone, trying to recapture a lost moment in time until he needs a paramedic.

I didn't take away a star but the quality it not  much digitally remastered in my book, there are actually places where you see where the film has a scratch, but it is not a new movie and I was glad to get it on DVD. I had it on VHS just recorded from TV with commercials so this is much better.  What I am making the point for is when you watch it on you large screen HDTV don't expect it to look HDTV or even up converted.

It's very sad that we lost Christoper Reeve at such a young age due to an unfortunate accident.  He was wonderful in this movie and he was the best Superman ever, but I love this movie because it shows what lengths a person will go to in order to be with the person they love....even if it means dying in the process.  I have watched this movie at least 25 times or more and never fail to cry during and after it.  I recently bought this DVD as a gift for a friend of mine who enjoys time travel stories and has never seen this one.  I couldn't believe he had never seen this, but I know he'll enjoy it because it is one of greatest movies ever made, in my opinion, and Jane Seymour is a stunningly gorgeous woman and Christoper Plummer is great in this movie as her over-protective manager.

However, my complaint is that there are major gaps in this movie and the ending was in no manner satisfying. It leaves you with a very big empty hole in your stomach and makes you wonder ""okay what the heck just happened?"".

The gap I'm mainly talking about is the time space in which the movie should have used to give the characters moments that help justify the kind of love they have grown to have with each other. It's like the guy comes into her life, goes out to walk with her....and boom, she's madly in love with him and so is he with her. They don't even show the steps in their relationship, the steps needed to form that kind of bond (they do but barely). You would expect to see them go out and have a good time and go through more relationship related issues before the end.

It's like the main part or body of the movie is cut out. The movie is good in one sense but horrific in another. The ending was pathetic and very unsatisfying in every sense. If you think about it, why would she do that to him? She basically destroyed his real life by coming back for him in the beginning part of the movie. True love isn't suppose to do that? What's the point? He was living a great life before he realized about her existence. She would at least have somehow dropped him some clue that would have changed their potential fate.

This movie is crap.....love it in many ways, but hate everything else. Man, I was hoping for a good movie with a great ending too, now I feel empty. I hate this movie....",1262044800,5,1769,4.240356083086054

Unlike LOTR tho, this show is only about just two ""time-crossed"" lovers -- meeting and re-meeting versus all odds. Rather than being IN a great grand glorious world like LOTR, the lead couple CREATE their own richly deeply private world. This brings to life the literal [oldest] meaning of world -- from wer-ald [human-being life-time]. Also, the scenery and settings are just spot-on for the several areas and eras. Much of this movie was filmed on an island where motor-vehicles move about only by special permission. The lead couple, as actors, really got into their roles -- so are utterly believable.

The scene that really got me was when Elise was making her speech about love in the play. Great movie. Sadly, Christopher Reeve had a horrible accidnt in the mid-90's, which meant he would never walk again. I'd have loved to see him and Jane Seymour do another film together.

1361797,5,B00004W46I,"This is the Other Christopher Reeve Movie that we remember.  Right after his first major success with the first Superman movie, he wanted to do something else that would show he was a legitimate actor and not an action star.  This movie did not make a huge splash in the box office, but thanks to it's repeats on cable in the 80s when cable first came out, it gained a cult status that would not be equalled among most romantic movies.  There is just enough mystery and fantasy elements to make us all cry buckets of tears, even the most hardened souls who have lost all hope at finding love and romance in the world.

Christopher Reeve plays Richard, a playwrite who is one day approached by an older woman with a strange message.  She hands him a pocket watch and says ""Come back to me"", then walks away.  A few years later, Richard does some investigating and finds out that the strange woman who did that passed away that very night she handed him the pocket watch.  What is this all about?  After some more research, he decides to travel back in time (no really) to find this mysterious woman who performed at a hotel in which he was doing to have his play premiere.  A little ridiculous?  Yes it is.  But then he sees the woman walking by the lake that he saw in the photograph, a beautiful Jane Seymour, Elise, in that delightful flapper outfit and looking just perfect.  They fall in love because they were meant to be in love even though they were born in different times.

Ridiculous?  Yes it is.  But then again, it's about love.  How many of us have done something crazy for love?  If you haven't, then you are missing out.  Even those of us who have been burned (as we all have in some way), know that we must take a chance in life because there are no absolutes.  And when we see that photograph or find that person from the past, we look at them and say ""that was the one who got away"".  And if you don't take a risk, you will not learn.

1361802,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere In Time is not alone a fantasy story. It is romance, science fiction, and fantasy formed into one, based on Richard Matheson's novel, Bid Time Return, (Matheson aswell wrote the cine and has a adornment actualization in the film). Attempt in 1980 and appear by Universal Studios, it is a admirable and, I feel, archetypal blur that has stood the analysis of time. I am generally afraid at how abounding bodies of developed age accept apparent it. I cannot accept why Somewhere In Time has been panned by the critics aback its release. Filmed on area in Chicago and Mackinac Island, Michigan, Somewhere In Time is a little continued at 104 minutes. However, the adventure never drags so this is not a big liability. Directed by Jean Szarc, the casting is aboriginal rate, starring Christopher Reeve, (what a accepted of claimed adventuresomeness he has set for us in contempo years!) as the columnist Richard Collier, Jane Seymour, one of the loveliest ladies to anytime adroitness either the ample or baby screens, as the extra Elise McKenna, and the accomplished actualization amateur Christopher Plummer as the chicken W.S. Robinson, McKenna's agent. The adventure begins in May, 1972. Columnist Collier is visited by a actual old woman at a affair he is accessory at Millfield College, abutting to the Grand Island Auberge on Mackinac Island, which will be so important to the adventure later. She approaches and easily him a abridged watch. Cryptically, she says, ""Come aback to me.' We now fast advanced eight years to Chicago, 1980. The active Collier, who has afresh torn up with his adult friend, is fatigued to The Grand Hotel. Collier drives up to Mackinac Island and checks into the hotel. The altruistic Arthur, who has lived and formed at the auberge for 70 years, asks him if ""they had met before."" Collier assures him they accept not. Collier affairs aloft an old photo of the about-face of the aeon extra Elise McKenna in the auberge building and is bugged by her. Arthur tells him that she appeared in a play at the auberge in 1912. Collier's attraction bound grows and he begins analysis on her life. He comes beyond a photo of McKenna as an old woman and remembers her as the abstruse adult he met at the party. He discovers from her charwoman that McKenna died eight years previous, on the actual night she fabricated herself accepted to him, and that something happened during her auberge actualization in 1912. After that, according to the housekeeper, she was never the same. During his appointment to McKenna's home, he discovers a book on time biking that Elise apprehend ""again and again."" After visiting with the book's columnist and, award his own name in an old Grand Auberge annals from 1912, Collier makes an acute ability to blooper into the past, and succeeds. Soon, he meets Elise in the hotel, (he has transported himself to the time if Elise McKenna is blockage in the hotel, advancing for her performance), and the arena area he and she accommodated is absolutely moving. At this point, the adventure becomes even bigger because Reeve does not accept to backpack it by himself. Seymour and Plummer footfall in and, what had been a acceptable picture, becomes an accomplished one for the duration. Richard and Elise bound become fatigued to anniversary other, abundant to Robinson's unease. Robinson, who loves her but will not accept it, has a 18-carat affair if the columnist Richard Collier cannot name any of his plan that he is accustomed with. There is an ailing astriction amid these two absolute men until film's end. There are abounding absorbing segments through this allocation of the story. Entering the auberge restaurant, Collier seems to airing forever. The attempt of the admirable Elise, sitting at her architecture table with hair down and befuddled over one shoulder, absorbed of Richard, is abundant to yield the animation out of any man, (certainly this one!). The kiss aboriginal amid Richard and Elise is actual affable and tender, and addition agglomeration forms in the throat if Elise afresh unpins her hair as Richard closes the aperture to allowance 117. But, conceivably the best arena in the absolute blur is if Elise, bent up with emotion, seems to extemporaneous anon to an appropriately affecting Richard, sitting in the audience, during the auberge performance. Now is a acceptable time to agenda that Jane Seymour possesses an absorbing aggregate of averseness and attraction in attending and demeanor. Ms. Seymour is something you do not appear beyond often: an acutely adorable woman but actual abundant a lady. The wholesome Reeve played off of her acutely well. The bent Robinson loses ascendancy of himself and has Richard baffled by thugs, causing him to lose believability with his brilliant forever. However, fate deals a atrocious duke to the accursed lovers as, just if they accept accepted their adulation for one another, Richard is abruptly alternate to 1980, alive up in the aforementioned bed he was originally transported from. I won't accord the story's actual affecting afterpiece away, I will just say that the emotionally devastated Richard spends the final few account of the adventure attempting to acknowledgment to 1912 and Elise. A few final comments. For admirers of romance, fantasy and science fiction, Somewhere In Time will absolutely be a appropriate treat. (That the music is hauntingly admirable alone enhances the mood). It was adorable to see Richard Matheson, columnist of such hard-edged tales as The Omega Man and The Shrinking Man, (to name but two), and who is apparent as an afraid eyewitness during Elise McKenna's Grand Auberge performance, about-face out such a able adulation story. I noticed alone one audacious alteration mistake, and that is an accomplished ability for a aeon adventure of this length. Near film's end, the crestfallen Richard lies absent and semi-comatose in a Grand Auberge bedfellow room, acquisitive for Elise, for a abounding week. If Arthur, (The charity of the constant auberge assistant afflicted me. I ambition I could accommodated a few Arthur types at hotels I break in!), finds him, the actuality that he has had little aliment or baptize for canicule and is alarmingly abutting to afterlife is afflicted aloft us. However, if we see his face, he is baldheaded and way too bright-eyed for a man beneath such a self-imposed ordeal! I achievement that conceivably anytime Christopher Reeve's bloom is such that he can already afresh co-star with the anytime admirable Jane Seymour. Mr. Reeve's concrete limitations notwithstanding, I accept they would still accomplish a agitating awning team.",1238976000,,6649,5.067518248175182

Seeing cars on the scene was odd since they are not permitted on the Island. In any case, this movie seems to be a cult favorite. I have seen it twice and was left wanting more each time. The acting isn't bad, but the storyline seems to leave a lot of gaps. The whole time travel premise is kind of flimsy, but in movies like this you sort of have to suspend disbelief. Thankfully the movie doesn't dwell too heavily on the time travel setup. What bothered me is that it seems like there were so many possibilities left unrealized with the plot. It seems very unbelievable that the two characters would fall in love so easily and quickly. There seems to be little basis for it. This is another one of those romantic movies in which the male character is charming, but basically appears on the scene as a stalker and yet the female character falls for him anyway. Many people report loving this film and you might too. However, if you like stories in which the plot realizes all of its potential and the ending isn't sort of a cop-out, you might be disappointed in this one.",1238198400,4,1176,4.39908256880734

It goes beyond imagination to touch deeply embedded questions within our psyches that our established religions refuse to accept. Why? Because the one-shot at life concept fills their coffers with tithings to save our souls from eternal damnation. Wrong. No soul can possibly fulfill its destiny in one short life, especially if the body dies as a child.  However, this film taps into that mostly secret thoughts we are taught to ignore.  It's that what-if kernal that nudges us to consider that we are now what we have earned to be based upon what we did in our earlier incarnations. It suggests that we should be much more careful in making choices because we will get exactly what we have earned.

  I loved Richard Collier's handsome self! Christopher Reeve (Richard Collier), was so good looking and handsome, and so full of charm, this is the type of man that can take a women's breath away, by just being near him! Richard feels so empty in his life, as a famous playwright, until he takes a vacation, and sees the painting of Elise! Elise was a very famous actress in her day! Richard can't get the picture of Elise out of his mind, and then Richard finds a way to travel thur time, so that he can meet Elise! During Richard's research, he also finds out that in his modern present day life, that he has already met Elise, when she was old, and at that time, he did not know who she was! But she immediately knew, who Richard was, and she even spoke to him!

 I loved the scene where Richard and Elise ( Jane Seymour) meet when Elise was young, while she is walking by the lake! I thought Jane was perfect for this part, she was so beautiful! I also loved the scene where Richard came to Elise's room to ask her to take a walk with him! I also loved Elise's beautiful clothes, and hats, and I loved the way she did her long, pretty hair!

 In this movie I so loved ,the heartfelt emotion, and passion, that Richard and Elise had for each other, it was so profound! I loved the chemisty between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. The theatre scene where Elise yearns for a man to touch the secret regions of her heart was awesome! And one small scene that really touched my heart, was the scene showing, how that photograped painting of Elise was made, that Richard fell so in love with, Wow!

 I also loved , the beautiful, soul stirring music to this movie, it says it all!

""Somewhere in Time"" is a romantic drama that works well as both a romance movie and as a science fiction film. I am not a big fan of romances, but as a time travel film, ""Somewhere in Time"" interested me greatly. The script of this film is written by Richard Matheson, based on his novel ""Bid Time Return"" (Matheson also wrote ""I Am Legend"" and a number of episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"", among other science-fiction and horror works), and he seems to have put a lot of thought into the logistics of his story, right down to the necessity of Collier having old money for when he goes back in time. Matheson's approach to time travel in this film is different from that which has been used in other films and yet, somehow it seems so much more logical than someone building a time machine, like in H.G. Wells's novel.

The only thing I didn't like about this film is the abruptness of the ending. According to the discussion boards on IMDb, a second version of this film exists, that is about an hour longer than this version, which doesn't surprise me. It feels as though something is missing from the ending of this version and a number of the plot threads are not adequately tied off.

1361864,5,B00004W46I,"""Somewhere In Time"" is a classic tale, representative of how two spirits, truly separated, cannot be separated, even by time and space.  It seems that few people truly find this kind of love, but once found, it rings quite true.  With true soulmates, even death cannot separate the two because the two are one and I feel this movie portrays that kind of love well.  Saying some words and signatures on paper can never compare to God truly uniting two souls together as one.

Today, many people run out and get married in order to legally have sex and children, yet they don't share this true union of the souls.  As difficult as it is to wait for such a union, there is nothing else that can compare.  Even having loved and lost in the past has no bearing on this kind of love.  May everyone find this kind of love once in their life before they pass from this earthly plane.

OMG....the score was and is breath taking .  I immedialtely looked into how to get to the Grand Hotel  where they have the yearly  homage to the movie w/costumes and all.  But, sadly transportation complexitites for me from the east coast was out of the question , so, I'll just enjoy joining the club  ' INSITE'  and live viacriously thru those who can manage to enjoy the remebrance each year & re-watch this wonderful fully packed version .  I wonder IF there will be a 30th anniversary DVD with new information of behind the senes ? I'd buy it .",1210896000,3,1278,4.01984126984127

1361883,5,B00004W46I,"I won't add to the laudatory comments about this movie but would like to raise an intriguing question in connection with the Steve Reeves/Jane Seymour movie, ""Somewhere in Time."" In 1970 Jack Finney copyrighted what he called ""An Illustrated Novel"" named ""Time and Again,"" which I have. It is a romantic, soulful read predicated on time travel back to an earlier New York City. I have always been struck by the similarity between the time travel ""method"" used by Finney in his book, and the sort of self-hypnosis method used in the Somewhere in Time movie. They are uncannily similar! Yet I find no credit for Jack Finney in connection with the Somewhere in Time movie on either the comments posted on Amazon.com or anywhere on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com).

Of interest also is that the professor character in the movie who tells Richard Collier about time travel is named ""Finney."" Can that be just coincidence, or was it intended as a kind of homage to author Jack Finney? Does anyone know?",1208044800,2,1003,4.797687861271676

1361888,5,B00004W46I,"I'm not sure how old I was the first time I watched our beat-up VHS copy of Somewhere in Time; it had to be several years after my first visit to Mackinac Island at age four. Over the years, I've come to greatly appreciate the nuances (and standalone merits) of this most gentle and unique love story.

The charming time-travel love story Somewhere in Time is based on Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return. The book is a deeply rewarding journey that reaches nuances and depths not present in the screen version, and is worth reading to compare. In the screen adaptation Somewhere in Time, Matheson also served as the screenwriter, lending the movie an unerring fidelity to the original work.

Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve in his first role after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B000059Z8J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Movie</a>) is a modern-day playwright in Chicago. As the film opens at a cast party for his latest work, an elderly woman walks up to him, instantly hushing the celebratory atmosphere, and deposits an engraved pocket watch in his hand, muttering, ""come back to me."" Richard brushes this off as the ravings of a senile woman until later, when a photograph shatters his indifference. Later, Richard seeks a weekend escape at Mackinac Island, Michigan after hitting the wall on his new work.

Once checked into the Grand Hotel (one of the world's largest vintage summer resorts, with the world's longest covered patio facing Lake Michigan), he is haunted by the sensual photograph of a beautiful woman in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History, and races to dig up any and all information on the luminous beauty (leading to some fabulous shots of recognizable structures on Mackinac Island). Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) was a promising young stage actress managed by the dour, possessive W.F. Robinson (Christopher Plummer). Richard toys with the idea of self-hypnosis to travel back to 1912 in order to meet Elise when she was performing at the Grand Hotel, and after several attempts, he succeeds (or is it only the product of a desperate and haunted imagination?), and begins a slow wooing of Elise. Humorous ""fish out of water"" mishaps plague modern-day Richard, including wearing an antique suit that was already an antique by 1912, and the dangers of shaving with a straight razor.

The phrase ""love at first sight"" doesn't quite capture the haunting sense of deja vu when Richard first speaks to Elise on the shore of Lake Michigan. A stricken Elise simply asks, ""Is it you?"" and Richard answers yes. It's as though the two have known each other for decades, or at least sensed the other's presence (the mechanics of said time travel, including the ""pocket watch loophole,"" are shaky at best). Their courtship is nearly thwarted by the machinations of the insanely jealous Robinson, who views Elise as his protegee (and property).

The bittersweet romance comes to a tragic end, much in the same vein as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-and-Mrs-Muir/dp/B000083C6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</a>&nbsp;(which is a very similar ghost love story set in coastal England, but minus the time travel), but ultimately has a fulfilling ending.

The cinematography of the 1912 portion is appropriately dreamy, with soft light permeating outdoor shots. The film's soundtrack by John Barry is quite possibly the most romantic I've ever heard, centered around a Rachmaninoff variation on a theme by Paganini.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somewhere-In-Time-1998-Re-recording/dp/B00000AFYL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording)</a>&nbsp;was quite literally the soundtrack of my youth; we would play it on trips to Northern Michigan, and on Mackinac Island in particular. Even if you never see the movie, it's worth purchasing the rerecorded Somewhere In Time soundtrack.

Reeve, Seymour, and Plummer all put in heartfelt performances, and the true star of the show is Mackinac Island and the Grand Hotel in particular. Although long valued as a Midwest summer resort, Mackinac Island became an international tourist destination with the cult status of Somewhere in Time.

The 20th-anniversary DVD features a one-hour documentary on the making of Somewhere in Time, with new interviews by the late Christopher Reeve (after being paralyzed from the neck down after a horseback accident in 1995), Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer, and other actors and crewmembers including director Jeannot Szwarc. Also included are cast and crew bios, production stills and notes, an audio commentary by Szwarc (I haven't listened to it yet, so I can't comment), a still photo gallery, the original theatrical trailer, and a segment on INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts. All in all, the bonus features lend new depth for diehard fans of the movie, but will probably not interest casual fans.",1205366400,2,5041,5.5718015665796345
1361889,4,B00004W46I,"Watching ""Somewhere in Time"" made me think of the daytime, gothic soap, ""Dark Shadows.""  In this television series, numerous characters traveled backwards and forwards in time.  ""Dark Shadows"" was known for its gothic horror but it was also famous for its gothic romance.  ""Somewhere in Time"" is great gothic romance.  Fans of time travel and gothic romance will cherish this movie.  The settings and costumes were lavish.  The beautiful hotel, the gold watch, the portrait, the gazebo, and the horse drawn carriage all worked together to create a wonderful gothic setting.  And there was an element of gothic horror.  What could be more horrifying than losing the one you love, knowing that  you are separated from them by time and space and can never see them again?  ""Somewhere in Time"" is one of those rare movies that is both heartwarming and disconcerting at the same time.

""Somewhere in Time"" made me wish I could travel back in time to that time in history when I was young and always going to the theatre to see good 70's matinee fare.  If you don't read another review from me, it's because I was able to travel back in time to my favorite year, 1972.",1202601600,5,1162,4.698019801980198

Think about it...the old lady gives Richard the pocket watch and challenges him to 'come back' to her.  He takes the watch with him back in time to meet her.  The watch stays in her possession, from 1912 to present day, when she gives him the watch.  So, when was the watch made?  By whom?  This watch has no beginning and is caught in an endless time loop (trapped 'somewhere in time'!).  I know that this isn't the point of the movie, or is it?

I say this partly because, although it may be considered overly sappy, this love story is told almost completely from the man's point of view.

IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS FILM -- please beware of SPOILERS WITHOUT WARNING in many of the comments!  (In fact, a few of them tell you practically every plot point and then say they don't want to spoil the ending for you -- but by then they might as well have finished!)

If you've never seen this film, please -- do yourself a favor and go rent it without having read any other comments :)  The collector's edition is worth the extra money.  Included is a very well crafted documentary on the making of the film.

1361899,5,B00004W46I,"Okay, we now know that time travel is an entertainable, and entertaining, idea. However, as Einstein showed - among many other sci-fi sorts of things - just because an idea is fun doesn't therefore mean it's possible. This film is both impossible and fun.

Could we travel in time? Yes and no. But such a pronouncement would only involve travel into the FUTURE. Time travel into the past is, well, just plain impossible. However, as this fascinating and inventive film (together with the more spectacular but less romantic Jeff Daniels foray A DISASTER IN TIME, or the more recent Jodie Foster/Carl Sagan brain-drain CONTACT) impressively shows, the time-space continuum is extremely complex and is therefore somewhat flexible. There are loops or pockets which contain certain possibilities. This means that - if we have enough imagination while watching films like this - we might actually influence the course of past/future events, given enough special effects, energetic screen writing, and decent acting. Lord knows as a kid I saw enough bad 1950s sci-fi films, or had enough rudimentary science classes in high school, to know that maybe - MAYBE - we could build a space ship one day that could somehow beat the speed of light and go to Mars or Venus, and then come back in two (earth) years, only to find out that thirty earth years will have passed . . . and while we have stayed young, our dear beloved one will have grown old!

But nuts to that. I really wonder if any of us in reality would settle for such a devil's bargain, as the well-known Twilight Zone Episode about Lincoln's assasination or the especially endearing Robert Lansing/Mariette Hartley couple so well demonstrated. Or that this film does. Accept it, folks - time travel into the past is an alternatively fun but nasty and ultimately impossible concept. Notwithstanding how much H. G. Wells followers might wail, kick, and scream, we'll never be able to focus on a Michigan island's hotel painting, or build a machine, or suffer a disaster in time, so as to go back and change past events. Never. However, at the same time it usually makes for a good sci-fi movie . . .

And that is partly what makes this particular piece of romantic hokum so lovely - all the classic time-travel elements are there. But the greatest asset, of course, of SOMEWHERE IN TIME - which made it an instant, certifiable, cult item - is the wondrous John Barry score (where are you these days, John?). It just carries you away. Not to mention the beauty of Jane Seymour. She glows.

Is this a perfect film? No. Notwithstanding any of its perceptible defects (such as the logical question ""Who made the watch?""), however, all I can say is kudos to director Szwarc, writer Matheson (""The Incredible Shrinking Man""), actors Reeve, Seymour, Plummer, and the rest of the cast and crew. No matter how many times you may have seen it, watching this film is always a wonderful experience. Such lyrical, romantic imagination.  Leave it to say that, as a one-time aspiring filmmaker, this is one I would have liked to have made. And for those who complain about the ending . . . shut up . . . the movie had already come to a satisfactory, effective climax before the hero looks into his vest pocket and accidentally saw that bloody coin!

Speaking of accidents, I only wish that, later on, he had kept off horses.",1194739200,,3358,4.741438356164384

It's not a perfect film. There are plot holes, yes. But Reeve and Seymour are so good, and so believable, that they draw you in. I read that Reeve took some criticism after the film was released by being TOO sensitive in his portrayal of Richard Collier! Well, that was 1980 for you, folks.

The DVD has a problem, or maybe it's just my copy, where at times in the film, the image suddenly becomes rather jerky. Fortunately, this doesn't last.

I enjoyed watching the interviews, hard though it was to see the once-vibrant Christopher Reeve in a wheelchair, having to talk around the operation of his respirator. It was hard, too, to see him in the film, walking and running with ease.

There's just something about this film that takes hold of you. As I mentioned before, Reeve and Seymour give perfect performances. I suppose that the magic here is that the relationship between them really works, and this is such a rare thing anywhere, at any time, that we willingly suspend our disbelief.

The thoughtful old lady presses a classic pocket watch, from a past existence, into his right hand and intensely whispers four haunting words 'Come back to me,' which will affect him forever...

Eight years have passed and Richard is seeing his work incredibly sterile, gently afflicted with a case of lesser inspiration... So he packs his luggage and heads out to an island of enchanting beauty, to the Grand Hotel on the Straits of Mackinac waterfront...

While waiting for the huge dining hall to open, he tours the grand old building's museum, and sees a portrait of a lovely woman... He becomes obsessed about finding the truth behind the old photograph and begins questioning the people that knew her past... What emerges is a wonderful woman who is the first American stage actress in 1912 to create a mystique in the public's eye... She is the same lady who visited him that night at the premier of one of his plays...

Richard finds himself intrigued... There is so much to hear... People who knew Elise McKenna when she was young said that she was quick and bright and full of fun... Strong, willful, not at all the way she was later...

Seeking help from an old philosophy teacher who had written a book about 'Travels through time,' Richard attempts to disassociate himself entirely from the present, move everything out of sight that could possibly remind him of it, hypnotize his mind, and transport himself backward into the past, into June 27, 1912, into the life of the stunningly beautiful and talented Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour).

Nominated for Best Costume Design, the motion picture is a romantic fantasy that avoids any use of machinery in action... The time travel theory is completely non-scientific... The film captures the idea of a fine young man moving back among other time periods, and affirms that love is an undeniable force which goes beyond us, a force with no limit to the spiritual power, with no end to the potential of spiritual expansion...",1168732800,,2189,4.855227882037534

1361938,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere In Time (originally published in novel format as Bid Time Return by the great horror writer, Richard Matheson), starring the late Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, has become a cult classic during the last twenty-six years.  I think it was the second or third movie that Christopher Reeve did after Superman.  Next to Superman, this is probably the other movie that most fans remember him for.  Though tall and extremely handsome, there was a slight awkwardness to his acting in this film, which fortunately turned out to be perfect for the character he was portraying.  Jane Seymour never looked beautiful as she does in this movie.  I think it made every man who saw it want to travel back in time just to be with her.

The story (beware of plot spoilers) deals with Richard Collier, a young playwright in college who has just seen his first play successfully performed and is backstage, celebrating with the rest of the cast and crew.  Everything is interrupted when an elderly, yet very elegant, woman moves through the crowd of people and silently approaches him.  She takes his hand and places an antique pocket watch in it, and then says only four words: ""Come back to me.""  The elderly lady returns home that night and dies.  The movie then jumps ahead several years to when Collier is now a world-renown playwright, living in Chicago.  He's just broken up with his girlfriend, plus he's having trouble completing his newest play.  He decides at the spur of the moment to hop in his car and to take off for a few days, hoping this will help him to regroup.  His journey leads him to the beautiful Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan, where he decides to stay for a day or two.  While waiting for the hotel's restaurant to open on his first evening there, he takes a tour through the hotel's Walk of History and sees a photograph of the lovely, breath-taking stage actress, Elise McKenna (played by the lovely Jane Seymour) , who performed at the hotel in 1912.  Collier finds himself mesmerized by the photograph.  He can't stop thinking about the woman in it.  It's almost as if he's fallen in love with her.  Wanting to find out more about her, he makes a trip to the public library and discovers that Elise McKenna was the elderly lady who gave him the pocket watch.  This leads him to investigate the hotel's old registers.  Collier finds out that he stayed at the hotel in 1912.  Though it seems impossible, he accepts the facts that are presented to him.  The only question now is how to return to 1912 and to the woman he loves.

Somewhere In Time is definitely a tearjerker in the biggest sense.  If you have a sensitive heart, you can't help but be moved by this film.  It still brings tears to my eyes, and I've seen it over twenty times.  The music to the movie is hauntingly beautiful and was done by none other than John Barry, who's more famous for his soundtracks to many of the ""James Bond"" films.  This movie has so many fans that they actually get together every year at the Grand Hotel to relive the film and to have a big party where they all dress up in the style of clothing that was popular in 1912.  The extras include a twenty minute ""Making Of"" documentary and a ten-minute look at the fans and their get together at the Grand Hotel each year.  This is a wonderful, moving film that speaks to one's heart and soul, and is highly recommended to those who believe in love.  Once you see it, you'll certainly want to buy the motion picture soundtrack so that you can relive the movie while you do other things around the house.",1168214400,5,3586,4.531881804043546

Especially when movies left-and-right that seem 10-times more substantial find a way to all end the same, there is a resolute-ness to how this far-fetched romantic fantasy ends (well, at least in life).

That's sad.

1361947,5,B00004W46I,"The deal with Somewhere in Time is simple: if you have ever been in love, or have a romantic bone in your body, and if you can put aside for 90 minutes the cynicism we all seem to need to survive this modern world, then you will love this film.

It may be a small, low budget movie but it tells an truly epic story of love. And gentlemen, let me say here, don't dismiss this as a simple chick-flick - if you are mature enough about your own true feelings, give this movie a chance. If you do, you will probably find that Somewhere in Time gets under your skin. Let it take you along for the ride and ultimately it could well move you to tears.

This is because SIT is a very open and honest film. There are no hidden meanings or agendas, nothing especially ""clever"" or complicated about it. It is an accessible, simple movie but that doesn't stop it from packing a powerful emotional punch. When I first saw it as a young man, I have to admit the main attraction for me was the fact that Jane Seymour was starring in the film. Having seen it again recently on DVD confirmed that she remains for me the most perfect incarnation of feminine beauty on film, but there was more, much more to the film in my eyes. Like all fine films, it has a heart and soul and like all fine films, it leaves you a slightly different person having watched it.

The movie is littered with special, memorable moments (most of which have been described in earlier reviews) but what sets this film apart is that you cannot doubt for a moment that the characters portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour love each other deeply. The exchanged glances between them say more than any dialogue. By the end of the movie, you believe that Richard will never find another woman like Elise and you fully understand his obsession, his desperation and ultimately his devastation at losing her.

Because Somewhere in Time is such an open, straightforward movie, it is an easy target. Inevitably some people will ridicule it. Whether you like this movie or not is something that asks as many questions about you as it does about the film itself. I'm not embarrassed to say I love it. You owe it to yourself to see it at least once (and preferably more than once to appreciate all of its extraordinary poignancy).

I only knew of Christopher Reeve for Superman, and then as I got older, Deathtrap (movie and play), Fifth of July (play), Monsignor (movie), etc.  But the comments are right, this IS his best role.  He plays Richard Collier, a reasonably successful playwright in the 1970s.  One day in 1972 after a successful show, an old woman walks up to him, hands him a gold watch and says ""Come Back To Me"".  Soon after she returns home and dies.  8 years later, it's 1980 and he's still thinking about her trying to get inspiration for his next play.  After checking into the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan, he starts having feelings of Deja Vu (even the old groundskeeper, bell captain seems to recognize him).  While going through the halls of history and some news clippings, he discovers pictures of beautiful actress Elise Mckenna (played in a bravura performance by Jane Seymour) who visited the island with her theater troupe in 1912.  He does some research on her and after finding a newspaper clipping from 1972 around he learns that the old woman was her.  Desperate to find out more, he finds a book in her last home called ""Travels in Time"".  He seeks out the author, who was an old professor of his, and learns his old professor's theories on time travel.  After returning to the hotel, he finds other artifacts of 1912 in the attic including the hotel registration, and discovers he was at the hotel back then.  He returns to his room, self hypnotizes himself and finds himself in 1912.  He then goes out of his way to find Elise, and become her friend without hinting anything about his trip from 68 years in the future.  He does, at they hit it off well, much to the dismay of the playwright/leader of her troupe played by Christopher Plummer.  In the end love conquers all (or so you think), and Elise stays with Richard after her troupe leaves the island with plans for the future.  Until, that is Richard pulls a 1979 vintage penny out of his pocket, which causes him to return to the present.  He tries to rehypnotize himself to return to 1912, but nothing seems to work.  The ending is right out of Wuthering Heights (the 1939 version), so I won't spoil it for you.  But suffice it to say, it is one of the most romantic stories I have ever seen and well worth the purchase.  I'm going to get off here now and see if the book it was based on; Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return is still available before I find myself in 1912 ""desperately seeking Elise"" as it were.:-).",1157328000,3,2551,4.490238611713666
1361951,4,B00004W46I,"Somewhere in Time tells the story of Richard Collier, a successful playwright who shortly after the start of the movie, is suffering from writer's block.  On a whim, he goes to a nearby ritzy hotel to clear his mind.  While there, he sees an old photo of Elise McKenna, a famous actress for her time, who was once a guest at the hotel in 1912.  He is entranced by the beautiful woman, and researches as much about her as he can.  On the way, he realizes she was the woman who gave him a gold pocket watch when he just graduated from college eight years before.  Now so in love with the woman he never really knew, he decides to hypnotize himself into believing he is in 1912 so that he can meet the woman he loves.  The only catch-any reminder of his present time in any way, shape or form will end the hypnosis and take him back.

This film is incredibly romantic, and the sweet chemistry between Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve only heightens it.  Jane Seymour, as Elise, gives the best performance in the film, showing great strength and weakness as her part requires.  The musical score, arguably the best part, is mostly the lovely sounds of piano and orchestra which complement everything wonderfully.  Unfortunately, the film is not perfect.

For one thing, some of the acting is a bit wooden and poor.  Reeve may have been a great humanitarian and the definitive Superman, but let's be honest, he was never much of an actor.  The script is not the best written, and the lines being recited just don't sound very natural to real life (such as when Arthur, a supporting character, can somehow name dates on a whim anytime Richard asks.  Finally, there are quite a few plot holes that are hard to ignore (i.e. if any reminder of present time can end the hypnosis, how come Richard's constantly reminding himself he's time traveled doesn't end it?).

The flaws are pretty easy to overlook as you get entranced by the film, though.  It is a great love story for the most hopeless romantic to enjoy.",1157241600,,2004,4.540389972144847

The first time I watched it was around 1983 with a mixed group of males and females. As soon as it was over, we rewound (video of course) and watched it all over again.

Not only is the story captivating but the chemistry between these two actors is truly rivetting. You BELIEVE you are in the room with them and the sparks are definitely real.

The intensity of Christopher Reeve's belief in time travel and his obsession with this beautiful woman are absolutely spellbinding. You want it to be real as it takes you into this other ethereal world of love and destiny.

There are a few quirky twists that leave questions in your mind (hence the watching again). Over the years, I have never tired of watching it frequently and delight in lending to friends who then share the same experience (albeit usually not as obsessive as mine).

She is like a heaven-gift angel.

The Book, ""Travels through Time"" was a key.  9 years previously Richard was a student of the professor.

While at college Richard studied with a physics professor, who wrote a book, ""Journey in Time"", on time travel.  Richard asked the professor, ""Is time travel possible""?  The professor believed he had accomplished time travel, only a few seconds because of objects from the present brought him back to the present.  The professor instructed Richard; too remove all the objects associated with the present.  Richard decides to buy a suite probably 15 years older than the target year 1912 and attempts to move his mind back in time.  In one of the last scenes, Elise jests about how Richard's suit is 15 years out of style and Elise wants to buy Richard a new suit.  It is during this scene that Richard discovers the 1979 penny disrupting the channel back in time and returns back to the present.

The professor told Richard, he believed time travel was possible and by emerging ones mind totally on the past and remove all reminders of the current, time travel to the past could occur.  Richard removes pictures, coins, and puts the recorder under his bed.  Richard discovers a registry for room 416 with his signature on it in 1912 that gives Richard confidence, he did return too the past.  Richard finally is completely emerged in the past and allowed to move back through the time/space absolute into the past.

Elise read ""Travels through Time"" over and over.  Elise in 1979, contacted Richard and placed a watch in his hand and said ""come back to me"".

Richard wakes up June 27, 1912 on a bed (416), at the Grand Hotel.  Richard seems determined not to change the events leading to the future.  It seems impossible for events too be changed in any disruptive manner.  Richard knowing the future would make sure events such as his signature at the grand hotel occurred for the correct room and time.  Richard's cohesion in preserving time event as understood in 1979 remained a necessity as he move through time/space into the future as it would happen in 1979.  Just as Richard must accept the facts that he will go back in time, so must he accept the time events that form the future.

If any evidence surfaced that pointed to the current, such as, a 1979 penny the time/space absolute time travel connection would be destroyed.  The watch would disappear, the night Richard returned too the future, and the night Elise died.  Did Richard fantasized his trip in time and so intensely emerge himself into the past that his realty became the past like a deep dream.  The mind's attempt to maintain symmetry would return him to the present and leave him devoid of his love.

In 1910, Arthur was five and came with his father, who worked in the Grand Hotel.  Arther would ask Richard in 1979, ""Have we met before"".  Richard in the past was kind to Arther.

In 1912, Elise had a photograph while smiling at Richard that hung on the wall of the Hotel archive room.  The photograph became a portal between the current and the past.  Richard fell in love with the photograph; the photograph seemed too span generations of time, a sink a love deep inside his heart with a message ""I want to be everything for you.  I want to make you happy"".  Richard was tormented by his infatuation and intrigue with the actress, ""One of the most revered actress on the stage"", ""creator of mystique on the stage"", and ""pinnacle of seclusion and privacy"".  Elise was ""bright"",""cheerful"", and after 1912 became quite.  Richard studied public library documentation on the Actress Elise McKeena.

Every woman dreams that a prince will walk into her life.  A companion she can express  her deep emotional expressions of affection, passion, and longing; a companion who will make her happy and she him.  ""Is it you"" touches the essence of her realm and decisions and his reply of ""yes"" is the appropriately direct and assertive.  Did two people travel back in time: Both Richard and Robinson? Robinson, told Elise she would met a man, who someday that would change her life.  Robinson used the illusion too keep Elise his captive bird and it is probably just a coincidence that Richard did travel back to met the perfect woman and free her.

Richard single mindedness hope to establish relationship is rudely intercepted by Robinson. Robinson tells Richard, ""leave Ms. Mckeena alone or I will see that your put out.""  What does ""Is it you mean""?  Richard is a complete stranger, a play writer from Chicago, and a man Elise has never before seen.  Richard is the symbol of the perfect man for Elise.  Does Elise have time for love?  Can Elise maintain control of her career and love Richard?

There was something strange about William Robinson (Plumber is brilliant - Shogan Jesuit priest adversary against Blackthorne) relationship with Elise.  Some of the music was reused in ""Dances with Wolves"".  Robinson is the ""Phantom of the Menace"" and claims too be the Actress ""Guardian"" responsible for turning Elise into a star.  Robinson worships Elise, finding her young, and culturing her into a star.  Robinson secretly loves Elise but can not declare his love for her.  The best Robinson can do is declares his possession of her.  When Richard asks Robinson, if he wants Elise for a wife, Robinson is insatiable about his appraise of Elise. Elise loves Richard and defends her love for Richard. Elise is cruel to Robinson telling him, ""I love Richard"" and rebukes sharply telling him not to interfere with their love.  Robinson rejection forces him, too bind in cord, Richard and leave him gagged in a horse stable.

Many of Reeves idoms seem quirky and boyishly ackward in comparison to British sophistry. ""If you do not walk with me, I shall go insane, simply mad."" ""Surely, I would walk with you and resolve all about me"", ""just say yes"", and ""she's crazy about me"".  The scenry and music are classics.  The movie only intrigues more and more people to watch over time.",1151193600,4,6139,4.736792452830189

1361959,4,B00004W46I,"Being one who always seems to enjoy time-travel stories, it's no wonder I like this movie so much, but it isn't the interesting ""time"" angle that draws me in: it's also the fact that this is one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen. I'm not usually a big fan of romance stories, but this one has always moved me, maybe because, as another reviewer points out, it's from the man's point of view.

The film is a wonderful old-fashioned type of story with a really nice feel for the period (1912) and is simply a pleasant, leisurely-paced story I found comfortable. Would kids of today like this? No. Too slow for them. Too bad, because I found the movie moved pretty well. The 100 minutes went by quickly.

Christopher Reeve is the star of the film but personally I found Jane Seymour and Christopher Plummer far more entertaining. The theme song, ""Somewhere In Time,"" is one of the prettiest songs ever and that adds to the sad and frustrating romance angle of the story. The language also is quite tame. Yes, it's a bit ""sappy"" at times, but for sentimental people, this is a nice film to keep.

My only real complaint is I've never seen a sharp transfer put on a DVD yet. There have been two DVDs out and both have that grainy look to them. That's disappointing because this would really look nice with a clear picture. The film deserves better treatment.",1145577600,10,1368,4.508064516129032

I can't imagine what the couple went through in their lives.  I would never want to be seperated from my wife and not be able to ever be with her again.

1361964,5,B00004W46I,"This movie is based on a true story of a man who travels back in time to meet the woman of his dreams. It was the only time in history that this amazing feat was accomplished. Richard Collier, played by the late Christopher Reeve, didn't use a time machine to go back in time. No, he actually conditioned his mind so extensively to believe he was back in 1912, that it unbelievably transformed him there. Richard fell in love with a photograph hanging in the auditorium of the Grand Hotel, located in Mackinac Island, Michigan, back in 1978. The photograph is of beautiful young woman named Elise McKenna, who was a talented and vivacious actress in the early 1900's. Richard was obsessed with her beauty and knew that it was his fate for them to be together. They shared a love that many have only dreamed of.
Many have tried to travel back in time as Richard did in 1978, but to no avail. I too have tried, and i will not stop trying til i am rejoined with my wife who was murdered 10 years ago in a bank robbery. I have recently purchased an old house and purposely kept it vacant (so that there is nothing current in my surroundings) so that i can condition my mind to be back in Feb 15th, 1996 at 9:00am, when the unfortunate murder of my beautiful wife took place.

1361973,5,B00004W46I,"Somewhere in Time is a love story for the true romantic.  It's not just your typical boy meets girl, falls in love, loses girl and reclaims girl.  In this heartbreaking story, the boy must travel thru time in order to get his girl.
Christopher Reeve, fresh from Superman, is Richard Collier, a playwright.  When the story first opens, Richard is a college student and his first play has just been produced.  In the audience is an elderly lady, who approaches him after the play's conclusion, puts an antique gold pocketwatch in his hands, and whispers ""Come back to me.""
Flash forward to current day (which was then 1980) and Richard is a successful, award-winning playwright living in Chicago, who has hit writer's block with his newest play.  Seeking to clear his head and reclaim his creative juices, he jumps in his car and heads out of the city.  He comes across the Grand Hotel, a real hotel located in Mackinaw Island, Michigan.  The hotel itself is enough to take anyone's breath away and Richard is no different.  He decides to stop there for the evening and while waiting for the hotel's dining room to open, he kills some time in the hotel's hall of history.  While there, he spots a photograph of the actress Elise McKenna, played by the ethereally beautiful Jane Seymour.  He falls in love immediately with her portrait and runs to find Arthur, the elderly hotel bellhop who informs him that Elise McKenna performed in a play at the hotel theater back in 1912.
Richard appears crushed but is unable to think of anything but this lovely actress.  The next day he travels to the local library to find out any kind of information on her and is stunned to find the last photograph taken of her - - it's the same elderly woman who presented him with the watch.
After a series of meetings, including with the woman who was her last caretaker/companion, Richard comes to believe that he was actually there back in 1912 and met Elise McKenna.  He wills himself back in time, to meet and woo her again, with the constant threat of the present hanging over him, not to mention Elise's overly protective manager, Robinson, who is not about to let any man come between him and his star protege.
What makes this movie such a feast for true romantics are several factors.  First, the actors are splendid and perfect for their roles.  In Christopher Reeve's eyes and voice, you can see and hear the longing and love for Jane Seymour, who is so beautiful that you honestly can imagine him falling in love with her portrait.
Second, the soundtrack music is heart stopping.  Can anyone hear the theme from this movie and not immediately think of the sweet, yet passionate, love of these characters?
Third, the location.  The Grand Hotel deserves to be considered one of the stars of this movie.  The hotel seamlessly transfers from the present day back to 1912 with no problem and no obvious inconsistencies.  The landscaping is lush and the design of the hotel and rooms is done to period perfection.
One warning to watching this movie though - - be sure and have a box of tissues handy.  Definitely one for repeated viewings.",1138060800,3,3122,4.664233576642336

Unabashedly romantic and manipulative, SOMEWHERE IN TIME works because of its romanticism and the fantasy/illusion of a love lost and refound.  Christopher Reeve is good as the hero who finds true love only to lose it because of a single reminder of his own time; Jane Seymour is breathtaking as always as the 1912 actress who Reeve pursues in time.  With its lovely photography and eye for periodic detail, SOMEWHERE IN TIME is one of those love stories that is irresistible in its romantic love story and twenty five years later still manages to bring a tear to the eye.",1131494400,5,761,4.838461538461538

Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour make such a handsome couple that if the material was given to any other pair, it might not have worked. These two always go back to this film as the one that made them noticed by the public.

John Barry's score is exquisite. Lush and beautiful, perfect for the film. I couldn't imagine this film with any other musical score.

However, their plan backfired; my brothers, although they weren't too enthralled with all the 'squishy/romantic' scenes, they were ecstatic about watching a movie with 'Superman' in it and I genuinely thought the movie was amazing.

The film definitely made an impression on me because, even after all these years, I still remember it fondly.

1361977,5,B00004W46I,"Have you ever felt so profoundly deep a connection with somebody that you would do whatever it took to be with that person? This heartfelt, innocent, and altogether gentle motion picture explores that question exceedingly well.

Based upon Richard Matheson's simalarly themed ""Bid Time Return,"" this is a unique fantasy that takes us into the life of Richard Collier. Collier, performed with great passion by the late Christopher Reeve, has just come off a successful debut performance of his most recent play in 1972. Friends and colleagues congratulate him in a post reception-style party, where he crosses paths with a most extraordinary old woman. She approaches from the abandoned back half of the party hall, handing him an exquisite gold watch on a chain, and says: ""Come back to me."" The story then shifts eight years ahead to 1980. Collier is now living in Chicago, his play writing has come to a standstill, and his love life is near non-existent. So, he decides to pack up and go away for a holiday to collect his thoughts. His travels take him to the posh Grand Hotel on Michigan's luxurious Mackinac Island where, upon entering the hotel's spacious Hall of History, he discovers a vintage portrait of the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Transfixed by her astonishing beauty, he proceeds to uncover everything he can about her. This information reveals that she is, infact, the very same woman who came to him years before with the gold watch. This, of course, is where the real story begins. It branches off into borderline science fiction as Collier develops a manner of willing himself back through time to 1912, the very year this woman performed in a play at the same hotel.

Various critics, it goes without saying, have attacked this film for being too superficial and corny. I, like many others it would appear, do not share in that sentiment. This is a beautiful and staggeringly emotional film. Much like ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" another movie I have reviewed here, ""Somewhere In Time"" is a movie that melts my heart with each and every viewing. It's the sort of film that reminds us just how powerful the emotion of love can be. You have Christopher Reeve portraying a man who gives up the life he has in the present to start a new one in the past with a woman he feels nothing but the utmost affection for. How patently romantic is that?

I have been recommending this wonderful film to just about every single person I know, and for good reason. This is the sort of romance that Hollywood just cannot seem to harness in dramas today.

1361982,4,B00004W46I,"The ultimate modern-day four-hankie chick-flick, ""Somewhere In Time"", starring Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer, and Teresa Wright (in a bit part) is an unabashedly sentimental, romantic, beautiful film that never fails to bring me to tears.

Reeve portrays Richard Collier, a young Chicago playwright, who, on the opening night of his first play, is approached by an elderly woman who pleads with him to ""Come back to me"" as she presses an antique watch into his hands. Intrigued, he starts to do some research and discovers that the woman was, in her youth, a beautiful and popular stage actress named Elise McKenna. He travels to a resort where she had performed, and becomes obsessed with a photographic portrait he sees on display there. (Next comes the really fantasy part) He decides he has to learn how he can travel back in time so that he may meet her, and by self-hypnosis, combined with other methods/props, they meet and fall in love. But trouble rears its ugly head in the form of Elise's overbearing and overprotective manager (Plummer).

Christopher Reeve is at his handsome prime here, and his performance is wonderfully Gary Cooperish-tall-awkward-naive-in love. Jane Seymour is at her most patrician, slyly feline best (her other best performance, IMO, has been in the TV remake of ""East of Eden"", which is actually a very fine film in its own right). Their performances, along with Christopher Plummer's, the beautiful soundtrack by John Barry, which is almost better than the film itself, and the costumes combine to make a great tearjerker along the lines of the old classics.",1117497600,3,1618,5.078947368421052
1361983,5,B00004W46I,"In my opinion, ""Somewhere In Time"" is the best and most beautiful love story ever put on the screen.

The music is so hauntingly beautiful, listening to it almost puts me in a trance... It sounds like an orchestra of angels in Heaven playing, with God as the Arranger, Composer, and Director. The music score is the life-blood of this movie. It is a MAJOR factor in the movie's overall effect.

I have to mention one scene... the scene where Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour)and Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) go out together for the first time in the horse drawn carriage... later they are out on the lawn where a man is doing a painting on an easel. The next scene shows a side-shot of Christopher Reeve studying something very intently and talking about it at the same time (but you can't hear what he is saying because they muted it out)... in this scene Jane Seymour is facing him but is also facing very much toward the camera, wearing a beautiful dress, white gloves, red lipstick, and a big, beautiful hat... the camera moves in closer and closer toward her face, she blinks her eyes and smiles as she looks intently at her newly found love... In this scene of only about 10 - 15 seconds, JANE SEYMOUR IS SO ** INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL ** THERE ARE SIMPLY NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HER. SHE LOOKS LITERALLY PERFECT. HER BEAUTY IS BEYOND COMPARE (This scene I am referring to is immediately before the scene where they are walking together on the shoreline in the distance toward the big, red lighthouse).

And lastly, it also occurred to me that ""Somewhere In Time"" is quite possibly the most passionate love story/movie ever made without ANY ** explicit ** sexual scenes... and I am most thankful it didn't have any... it would have greatly taken away from, if not ruined, the entire movie.

Obviously, I recommend it very highly. But it is still always a good idea to rent first, to be sure you want it for keeps, then buy it if you do.",1114992000,6,1937,4.541547277936963

That was my reading class assignment. Anyway back to this movie. It grabbed me in the sense that Reeve was living his own life as a playwright, and he had pretty much no relationships, or any one to account for, but himself, and it was as simple as a woman brushing past him saying something about ""Don't Forget Me"" to turn his life upside down. It wasn't a command, or a plea. It was said in whispered tones to where only he could hear her. It gave me the impression of what Christ does to our hearts. Like that woman knocking on the door of Reeve's heart beckoning him to seek Jane Seymour back in 1912 Christ stands at the door of our heart, and knocks hoping we'll let him in. I haven't seen this now for almost 24 years, and would like to know what happens when he meets her in 1912. Do they fall in love? does he stay in 1912, or goes back to 1980?

I began to truly appreciate this intoxicating romance after the fifth viewing. It took that long to appreciate the gems of prose, high class-acting, and sheer elegance portrayed by Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour in possibly their most heart-warming roles. Keep a box of kleenex handy for some tender tear-inducing moments.

My favorite scene is the stage set where Elise (Seymour) slips out of script and opens her heart for the special gentleman seated in the audience (Reeves). This had such an impact on me that I wrote down the beautiful words and here I share them with you; ""The man of my dreams is almost faded now. The one I have created in my mind. The sort of man each woman dreams of in the deepest inner-most secret reaches of her heart. I can almost see him now before me. What would I say to him, if he were really here? Forgive me; I've never known this feeling. I've lived without it all my life. Is it any wonder then, I fail to recognize you? You brought it to me for the first time. Is there any way I can tell you how my life has changed? Any way at all to let you know the sweetness you have given me? There is so much to say and I cannot find the words, except for these; I love you.""

Time really worked with the people who made it possible. And the acting. Oh my gosh, the acting is amazing!

Richard Collier is a playright just barely entering the 1980's. He knows something is missing in his life but he just can't place his finger on it. Upon a spur of the moment vacation, he comes across the Grand Hotel which strikes him as inspiring, until it becomes even more with the history of 1912 it has behind it that in fact includes him, even though he is only 29 years old, and along this line, a woman is looking for him.

Though something has occurred along this line in time, Richard knows he has someone waiting for him, and that is he wants to find the woman he's been looking for, he'll have to sacrifice everything he knows and understands completely in the present for him to find his real life in the past, where Elise Mckenna and Richard will find each other in time.

Before Back To The Future even came out, the brilliant Somewhere In Time brought up the thought of time travel without a machine, but only using the power of the mind. It is in fact extremely believable the way it is explained, and how it is done, and that's not easy to do. There was no doubt in my mind throughout the whole thing that he had in fact done it, and the way the whole process was reversed was also incredibly believable.

The acting is amazing by the two very young Christopher Reeve (before his fateful accident) and Jane Seymour. The chemistry between the two is amazing. It made you feel as if they were chosen so perfectly for the parts, they were just meant to play those roles alone. I've seen them in other films, but none nearly as rememberable as in Somewhere in Time. Other fantastic actors such as Bill Erwin, and Christopher Plummer make this an even better movie to think and create an illusion in your own mind that you aren't watching a movie, but a real life story. I'm sure many people can relate to what happens throughout the film.

Even if you didn't like the film, one thing you cannot deny by the whole thing is the amazing music. The Rhapsodey by Rachmoninoff, which was composed by John Barry, created a whole essence to the movie and it's plot all by itself, and you couldn't help but notice it the whole time in the movie. I was really surprised that Rachmoninoff could do something so beautiful instead of always being heard with these loud thumps on the piano.

I just wish more romance movies would tangle with my mind such as Somewhere in Time. I'm only 14 and usually I like more action or horror movies, but in this case, Somewhere In Time did me over so much, the romantic feel to the movie somehow brough the imagination back out in me. Plus, the DVD has a really cool making of documentary on the film, and tells you so much you never knew about the film. It went a long way and still got criticized by reviewers. But I'm glad the public liked it. Even if you don't want to see it, at least see it, and maybe you'll find the romantic feeling within yourself. Don't let time pass you by before you see Somewhere In Time.",1108166400,7,3346,4.3974151857835215

I have always thought I would enjoy this movie and when I found it I was happy to finally see the film everyone had been raving about for so long. They were raving alright, stark raving mad!

I can hardly find the words to describe this movie, but I will try. Lackluster, boring, sappy, poorly acted, poorly written, stupid, juvenile, lame, stale and other such adjectives.

I am a fan of Jane Seymour but was disappointed to see her character falling in love with the boyish and sappy man played by Christopher Reeves. Whatever happened to the man of Steel? I can't imagine her EVER falling for his boring and babyish persona.

I was glad when he died. I found his costume ugly and unbelievable and he acting the worst yet. Why on earth go for someone like that when you have Christopher Plummer around? Please! His was the best acting in the film. I still can't believe I sat thought the whole thing. I suppose I kept hoping that it would improve. Sadly I was wrong and it continued to serve up the sap.

C.R'S character seemed so weak that I couldn't imagine being attracted to him. The romance scenes made me laugh because you just couldn't take C.R'S advances seriously, he seemed silly.

It shows that if u love and believe enough neither Time nor Death will hold it back. If your want to completely understand this movie, and I say this to EVERY person I tell 2 watch this movie, watch it AT least twice.

An elderly woman comes up 2 him out of nowhere and puts something in his hand and says: ""Come Back To Me"".  And leaves.  Everyone asks who she was and he said he had no idea.  He looks in his hand and it is a pocket watch.  Several years later he is an accomplished Playwrite but is in a slump.  He decides to go on a pseudo vacation.  He ends up at this hotel on a whim.  He finds a picture.  The picture has his attention.  He is obsessed with it.  The picture draws him in.  He asks who it was by a guy that worked there for about 60 years.  Arthur says  ""Elise McKenna that picture was taken in... 1912"".  Richard decides since he is so drawn to 2 the beauty in the picture he needs 2 find out more.  He goes 2 the local library.  He researches Elise Mckenna.  He finds out she was an actress.  One of the most accomplished actresses in the very early 1900's.  Volumes and volumes.  And he comes across the last picture that was taken of her... it was the woman that gave him the pocket watch a few years ago.  I am not going 2 tell u the end it is up 4 u 2 watch.

1. difficulty for lovers. time travel turns out to be of great difficulty, especially to the past. It is nearly impossible. Elise could move close to a black hole and come back so as to travel to the future if she knew that Richard had come from 68 years later. Anyway, it's difficult;

2. ""come back to me"", ""is it you?"" words like that;

3. Elise's address to Richard on the stage;

4. Elise's belief that she was going to meet someone near the lake to change her life, which makes ""love at first sight"" plausible. Such belief of fate for the female part;

5. also many great movies needs time for people to accept them, especially you need to watch it for multiple times to get it and start to love it. so the box office won't be good to start with

P.S.

I initially watched it because someone told me it's a science fiction of time travel by Richard Matheson. I watched it on a 5 inch black-white portable TV connected to my dvd player, since my color tv was occupied for video game only. And, yes, I love the movie. I also read the original book, ""Bid Time Return"". Planning to visit grand hotel, maybe, room 416. wonder if they still ask you to sign the guest book there.",1100736000,3,1267,4.365957446808511
1361992,4,B00004W46I,"In some ways this review is a little difficult to write because I read the book before seeing the movie and I suspect I would have reacted differently to the movie had I not read the book.  Specifically, I don't think I would have liked it.

That said I did like this movie very much.  Somewhere in Time is based on the novel Bid Time Adieu by Richard Matheson.  The book is now titled Somewhere in Time because of the popularity of the movie.

For those not familiar with either: Richard Collier is a 36-year old writer who falls in love with a beautiful actress - Elise McKenna. But there's one big problem. She's dead. She lived years ago in another time. But that doesn't stop Richard who figures out a way to travel back in time and win her heart.  And that is basically all there is to the plot, a romantic love story between two misplaced souls.

The movie is very well written and is, for the most part, true to the book.  Of course Richard Matheson, the book's author, wrote the screenplay so that isn't surprising.  The good thing about the movie is it moves along at a reasonably nice pace and the mood it evokes is very much like the book - a nostalgic setting and ethereal romance.  The lighting, the pace, the set, and the very good acting make the move work.

The stars of the movie were the late Christopher Reeves - whose unruly hair and kind of stiff but gangly bigness make Richard Collier a likeable goof.  Jane Seymour was fabulous as Elise McKenna.  And Christopher Plummer, in the role of her overbearing manager, played his role to the hilt.

Back in 1982, ""Somewhere in Time"" aired on network television. I sat through the film spellbound by the beautiful scenery and sincere acting. Critics in 1980 (when the theatre-run movie first opened) did not like it nor could they understand why anyone else would. At the time I was only 12, at an ""impressionable"" age where B movie fare such as ""Xanadu"" and ""Grease 2"" made me ooh and ah. Twenty-two years later, I still love this romantic fantasy as much as ever, even though I tend to go for more mind-bending work such as ""Mulholland Drive.""

What the critics don't get and what is just plain wonderful is that ""Somewhere in Time"" no longer carries a ""bad movie stigma.""  The Richard Matheson-scripted film enjoys a strong following among people who love lavish cinematography and lush film scores. Quirky movie guides often list ""Somewhere in Time"" as a must-see. You don't need a book or a critic, though, when you've got that magic feeling you get from this Jeannot Szwarc-directed piece. Movies today may be a lot smarter, charge your brain better and depict our often cruel world with frightening clarity, but can you honestly remember the last time your heart was tugged at with gooey-free innocence and yearning? If not, give ""Somwhere in Time"" a chance.

Many who enjoy Christopher Reeve's varied film career cite ""Superman"" as the work that made them take notice. For me, it was his role as the good-hearted Richard Collier who goes the distance for true love and is unwilling to face its loss. Jane Seymour, the 80s tv-miniseries darling and now a beloved celebrity, proved she could lend an understated touch to her acting and a modesty that suited the 1910 setting of ""Somewhere in Time.""",1097712000,10,2259,4.665829145728643

The only thing we get to know about him is that he writes scripts and recently had a girlfriend who dropped him. There is no story about the women.

In my opinion, the two leads do a wonderful job of convincing the audience that they're in love. Jane Seymour especially moves you as you realise that she is afraid of loving him, due mainly to the fact that it's so overwhelming for her. Christopher Reeve as well gives a sterling performance.

1362006,5,B00004W46I,"As other reviewers have said, this movie seems to transcend all of its faults and strike a a very personal chord in the romantics among us.  Its intense romanticism prompts us to break the rules in judging what makes a good movie, much as Christopher Reeve's love for Jane Seymour allows him break the rules of time.  And, the movie is even more poignant today, since it's about going back into the past, and it reminds us of the past physical vibrance of Christopher Reeve, not as Superman, but as the healthy young man he was.
In many ways, this is Reeve's movie.  He almost ruins it with his occasional lapses into Clark-Kentish oafishness, but he also injects into the film its dreamy sweetness, with his hungering eyes and his boyish awe of Miss Seymour.  Speaking of her, I think she is one of the most beautiful and competent screen actresses in films and I have no idea why she never really became a huge movie star.
Christopher Plummer adds the right notes of meanness, thinly-veiled jealousy, lurking menace, and his own inner hurt as the blunt end of a love triangle.  He also embodies reality, reminding us, by his dissapproving presence, of the vulnerability of the fragile love affair between Reeves and Seymour.
The special segment on the making of the film (in the collector's edition DVD) is a good one.  It convincingly shows that the director, crew, and cast loved making this film and had high hopes for it.  It also provides some interesting insights into how the novel was adapted for the screen and the choices, sometimes painful, that had to be made in the process.  It's gratifying that this segment, which is low-key and refreshingly sincere, features the three principal stars of the film, the director, the composer, the author, and other players and crew members.  Only the composer, John Barry, seems a bit taken with himself.

So many reviewers already gave a synopsis, so let me get straight to what I think is the heart of the movie. This movie is a fairy tale with a message on love. People either accept it happily or sneer, the latter I find to be sad. This movie gives us young Jane Seymour, the goddess of mini-series as the leading lady. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful women ever, today she is still incredibly beautiful at 50+. Her chemistry with Chris Reeve is absolutely thrilling.

The ending I would have liked to have seen would have had the penny that returned him to the future 'magically' drop from the bed (after his frustrating attempts to return, failed) and roll out of the room (under the door), then fade onto the picture of her and watch it morph into a picture of THEM, leaving us with the understanding that he returned back in time and they lived happily after after.",1075593600,2,637,4.5964912280701755
1362013,5,B00004W46I,"I am offended by the reviewers who have referred to this movie as a ""chick flic.""
I am a guy, with red blood, and I am exclusively heterosexual; yet this movie is my favorite movie.
Anyone who doesn't give this movie 5 stars must have never truly kissed a woman.  Have you ever kissed a woman, just kissed her gently, and you both were sent high up into the air, even above the clouds, you both could feel your bodies floating up and up and up.  Your hand was on HER back, but you could feel that same hand on YOUR back, as if you were her, for that moment.  You experienced it both through your own lips, and hers.  It was magical.
If you HAVE experienced this, you will relate to this movie.
If you have NOT experienced this, you are missing out on LIFE...
This movie speaks to me on the deepest level of who I am.  I consider it so sacred a movie, and unlike any other, that I don't mention its name to my friends.  Even the few who have discovered my connection with the movie have been asked by me to not talk about it, even in the most positive terms.  Pearls are not meant to be cast before swine, and if you don't keep pearls tightly clenched in your fist, you never know when the swine are around you, which might snatch the pearl.",1073692800,6,1240,4.141666666666667
1362014,4,B00004W46I,"True romantics will love 'Somewhere in Time' with its haunting overtones of other fantasy romances: 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir', 'Portrait of Jennie' -- and touches of 'Laura' too, with a man falling in love with a portrait. Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour are perfectly cast in the leads with Christopher Plummer in a memorable supporting role.
Of all the films to which Jane Seymour has brought grace, this one might be her shining glory. She is effecting and lovely as in this appearance and perfectly cast. Her brief soliloquey on stage is by itself well worth the price of admission.
The settings are fantastic -- including the Lake Michigan hotel area -- and costumes, photography and music give added weight to the slight story.  John Barry is a composer of film scores whose work never ceases to please and charm. His signature counterpoint of deep strings responding to the central theme reach the depths of the heart. His contribution here is exacting.
However, the towering success of this film is in its managing to bring light to the this elevated plane of a grand romance, so rare that most of us never even see it for ourselves in a lifetime, much less experience it. We all yearn for it. It is the aerial dream of souls that have evolved to subtle levels of discernment.
It is for this reason that this film has risen and continues to rise to the level of a cult favorite and far above the heads of its boorish critics. Yes, it's fantasy, but so is true romance.",1073088000,24,1479,4.623574144486692
1362015,4,B00004W46I,"This is a time-travel fantasy on a par with ""Back To The Future,"" but far more romantic, and using, arguably, a more interesting device for time travel: self-hypnosis.  The fantastic premise is simple: what if convincing yourself you were in the past actually took you there somehow?
First, the basics. The script is great. The plotting is airtight. The cinematography is perfect. The acting is very good. The direction, and the timing of action, is stellar.  It has what I'd call the best on-screen kiss.  And the crowning feature of the film is something I don't dare mention.
What makes the film work, though, is that it doesn't spell it all out for you.  At its end you'll be thinking lots of ""hows"" and ""whys"", and wanting to see it again to figure things out better.
Jane Seymour (as actress Elise McKenna) is luminous here. Christopher Reeve is winningly gawky and hunky at the same time.  Their romantic tension is palpable, and it makes their high-speed love affair very convincing.  Christopher Plummer has great substance as Elise McKenna's protective manager.
This film at once takes romance seriously, and uses time travel to create a mind-bending plot that will haunt you afterward.
The only weakness of this film is that it is a bit light on the characterization.  We see that Richard (Reeve) and Elise (Seymour) love each other, and we must guess that it is ultimately because of their love for the theatre, but this is never made fully explicit.  Still, this ""weakness"" is in the nature of this very plot-driven film.  It's mainly a series of events that all fit together like a puzzle, rather than a study of human nature.  That the romance is so believable is a tribute to the acting and the direction, rather than the script.",1071705600,6,1745,4.767441860465116

The score by John Barry (responsible for James Bond music 1962-1985) is SUPERB and that and the scenery alone are worth the price of admission.
Jane Seymour is (and today STILL is)a stunningly beautiful woman!  The chemistry between the two is excellent.
This is not a chic flick nor is it a corny old romantic story alone.  It is an almost classic plot with quite a bit imagination to help it along and to update it.  After all, the movie started and ended in 1979 when it was shot.",1067904000,3,711,4.603174603174603

""Somewhere In Time"" tells the story of a writer from 1972 that develops an obsession with the image of a young actress from 1912, somehow he thinks that this woman is someone important in his life. So he finds a way to travel back in time: he can concentrate and separate himself from his actual time, and project himself in the past (...) to find his love interest.
""Somewhere In Time"" doesn't have great special effects, doesn't have spectacular performances, but does have a charming story that will provide two hours of good, clean entertainment.

After visiting the hotel that has traces of the woman's history he finds himself immeshed in the theory of time travel and proceeds to successfully go back to a time at the hotel when she was a beautiful actress starring in a play on the grounds.

This movie grabbed me like few others ever have - although I do enjoy watching romance movies, this is one of the very few that I own.
Reeve and Seymour have amazing chemistry together.  The story is very pure and sweet, unlike many movies today.  However, there are some humorous scenes - like when Collier is practicing what he'll say to Elise.  It seems funny that a modern man would have such a difficult time approaching a woman of a different era - but each of us can probably relate to that nervousness!
Seymour has a wonderful soliloquy that always captures my heart, where she speaks of her love.  Her character is an inspiration - she is strong enough to do her will and not be manipulated and pushed by others (her manager).

We highly recommend this movie followed by a weekend at the Grand Hotel for a real treat",1021680000,3,432,4.094117647058823
1362031,4,B00004W46I,"I first saw it on TV. at age 5.  It was one of those late night movies they show on the weekends.  I had the chicken pox which allowed me the privilege to stay up late.  At first, I had no interest in the movie because I was (and still is) an action/adventure type movie go'er.  Yet, the idea of time travel had its appeal and drew me in. (Also due to the fact, that I couldn't reach the remote control!) So, I watched the movie and I actually enjoyed it. (Although, the ending was a bit tragic.) Thus, ""Somewhere in Time"" became on of my favorite mushy, lovey-dovey, chick-flicks!
The plot is rather simple(heh heh). A guy meets a mysterious old lady in the present (well during the 1970's). She gives the guy something and tells him to ""Come back to her!""  The guy is like what the '----' who is this chick (paraphrasing here) and like whatever!. Some years later, the guy gets dumped (I think?) and is suffering from play writer's block. So, the man goes to a nice hotel that was there since the early 1900's for inspiration for his play. The hotel--incidentally--has a history museum and the guy decides look around. Then low and behold, the dude sees a picture of this bodacious babe. He finds out that the chick in the pic was non-other than the mysterious old lady that he met years ago! Like totally weird! The guy gets totally obsessed with the bodacious babe in the picture and tries to find out anything and everything about her. This does not help cease his 'thing' for this girl and he wants to be with her.  Question is, how?  She's long gone and in the past while he is stuck in the 80's. Hmmm, well time travel seems like a good (but whacked) idea! So, our love sick playwright opposes all the laws of classical physics--without a Dalorian (sp?? Back to the Future)and his ""Superman"" powers (the 'reverse the earth's rotation thingy')--in order to be with the love of his life! The rest of the story is pretty much history. I don't want to give too much away (probably did)to those who have not watch the movie!
Yeah, story is a bit corny (and vague) at times, but it has its 'oh that was so romantic' parts in it that would sweep anyone off his/her feet. The actors and actresses in this movie did a good job in their roles.  Christopher Reeves was charming and fit his character well. Also, Jane Seymore made and excellent Elise.  The costumes that were used were pretty cool (especially Elise's awesome dresses).  Plus, for all those Rachmaninof fans out there (like I am), you'll love the score. Hey, Rachmaninof and romance go together and this is a romance flick. So, if you watched the movie and liked it, then kudos for you! Might as well get the movie. Might as well get it on DVD. I did! Also, if you didn't see this movie, then go see it. However, beware of the ending. It is sad. Just as sad as the ""City of Angels"" chick, that got hit by a truck after getting it on with the cute angel dude!  (What an idiot! Sorry that movie just ticks me off! Maybe, I should review it!) Then, after you've seen the movie, write a review for it on Amazon.com. Just like what I'm doing, at 2:02 in the morning, supposedly studying for finals!",1020211200,5,3155,4.385273972602739
1362032,2,B00004W46I,"I say this because I think it could have been great but the plot holes are just too large and is it necessary to have Reeves in every frame of the movie? We get very little perspective on Janes character.
The plot holes are quite large and I won't even stir up the ""well when was the first time he went back for her to have remembered him?"", paradox.
Ok, why is it after he's tied-up and realises she has left does he fall apart? Doesn't he realise he can just go find her in the next city? I mean he HAS gone through time for 'crise sakes! Hopping a train MAY be easier! Why is it that Janes manager simply has Reeves ""tied-up"" to be begin with? Doesn't he realise that when Reeves is untied he will simply come looking for Jane? And the whole ""You are going to marry me aren't you?"", line by Jane at the end of the movie is just nausiatingly unrealistic. Life just doesn't work this way... I'm sorry but not even in the movies.
These and many other silly things that just don't add up can be found. And they hit us over the head with ""Arthur"" and his red ball too. Ok, we get it! Thats the old man from the future! Arthur this and Arthur that, Arthur, Arthur, Arthur!
I don't have the new 20th Ann. addition, and all I can say is I hope the transfer is better than the early one on dvd, the picture is quite grainy... so much so that it will make you wonder whether your dvd player is on the fritz!
After all is said and done, I like the ""idea"" generated here. I do like Jane and her managers performance... I like the soundtrack... I like the sets... but honestly the chemistry was flat, and thats the most important part of it all.

Of the many romantic fantasies on screen, this movie stands alone.  It is romantic from beginning to end and, though a bit loose at times, the story fascinates and keeps one's attention.

This DVD is the best the film has ever looked. Picture quality is at times disappointing, and the audio never was very well mixed to begin with, but there has always been something beautiful about this film's imperfections. The score by John Barry is of course exceptional and incredibly moving, and the performances are top-notch all round, as I'm sure most of you reading this will already know.
Particularly interesting on the 20th anniversary DVD is the documentary 'Back to Somewhere in Time'. Over an hour long (no half-baked featurette this), it features retrospective interviews with ALL principles (including the usually elusive Christopher Plummer) with the exception of Susan French (who played the older Elise). Filmed during 2000, it is refreshing and reassuring to see a cast and crew expressing their love for a film as much as its fans, and also their appreciation of everyone who has kept it alive.",988848000,8,1055,4.966101694915254
1362039,4,B00004W46I,"Somewhere in Time is an excellent film that combines Time Travel with romance, using an interesting and unique idea involving hypnotizing your mind to believe you are actually in that moment in history.  If you can avoid analyzing the rationality of time travel and suspend your disbelief, this film will be very enjoyable for you.  The idea of travelling back through time to find your soulmate is something both men and women can believe in.  It is to the credit of the performances of the leads, Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, that the viewer believes that such a thing is possible.  Reeve and Seymour also look well together and have obvious chemistry, making their love affair entirely believable. Especially with their first kiss, there is a deep and passionate love that seems entirely real. The third element is the acting of Christopher Plummer, who is always excellent and quite effective here as the overprotective manager of Seymour's character.  But, there are two more elements that contributes greatly to the atmposhere of the film - the moving music composed by John Barry, and the Grand Hotel where most of the movie is set.  The handsome and expressive Reeve, the calm beauty of Seymour, the brooding and calculating Plummer, the romantic and moving music and the timeless presence of the Grand Hotel combine into a magical film for the hopeless romantic.
DVD Comments:  Compared to reference DVDs the video and audio quality are average, with slight graininess at times.  However, this can be forgiven because of the excellent quality of the film.  Those who have only seen Pan Scan versions on Cable and VHS will enjoy the widescreen presentation.  The extras include a Behind the Scenes Special, Trailer, Fan Club Information, Bios and Production Photos.  All are excellent and welcome additons.  Of note, I found the Behind the Scenes Special added to the film experience. You will learn interesting tidbits about the making of the movie, with comments by the director, Reeve, Seymour and other players.  It becomes readily apparent that the actors and crew loved making this film and hold it in a special place in their hearts.  To see Reeve, who suffered a horseback-riding accident that left him paralyzed years after making the film, lends to the heartbreaking experience of seeing the film again.  His comments about the final scenes of the film are very interesting and insightful to his own tragic life experience.  The production photos are excellent, especially the stills of Seymour with her incredibly beautiful face and long, flowing hair. It is easy to relate and believe that Reeve's character would fall so hopelessly in love with her picture alone.  The events that occur in the film, the time travel and events that happen at the end of the film are believable because of Seymour's beauty and acting ability.  All of the actors, the setting, and the music are important aspects of the film, but Seymour makes the movie.  Therefore, if you are a hopeless romantic, or a fan of Reeve or Seymour, I highly recommend this DVD to you.",987811200,126,3073,4.955165692007797

It makes you laugh and cry all at once, and the cast truly does shine! It's such a shame it never did get the praise it has now when it first came out, but it has truly become something special like a true piece of art! My compliments to Christopher Reeve, director Jeannot Swarcz, and the cat and crew of this movie for making it such a true classic for all of us!",980726400,8,665,4.203125
1362044,4,B00004W46I,"If you own the VHS version, don't bother... The encoding quality of this movie is appaling.. It looks more like an optical copy from a digital video camera than a digital encoding. and I can't believe that they didn't remaster the sound track. Yes folks it's presented in Dolby 2. Yes mono. I was very disappointed, however the story is enduring, and that's why I bought it.",977011200,,374,4.597014925373134
1362045,5,B00004W46I,"This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I bought the DVD version and boy, was it worth it. To hear Elise say ""Is it you? Is it?"" is like hearing church bells ring. It's a beautiful and haunting story. Being without it in your collection would be like finding a 1979 penny in your pocket. (you have to see the movie... I'm not going to give it away). The DVD version is incredible. The interviews with the cast make the movie even more enjoyable. They discuss the filming, the location, how they all got along... if you like the movie already, buy this DVD, just for the extras.",976406400,6,587,4.345454545454546
1362046,5,B00004W46I,"I love the living daylights out of this movie. If you don't agree with me, then, as my Italian grandmother one memorably uttered after an entire evening of watching ""Welcome Back Kotter"" reruns on Nick at Nite, ""Uppa you nose-a with a rubber-a hose-a.""
But more importantly -- I have a real soft spot for this movie.  It's a little over the top, and doesn't always make sense, but that's why people like this kind of story. The music is like the soundtrack to ""Doctor Zhivago"" on steroids. Jane Seymour gets plenty of opportunities to do that signature smile of hers, with the curling lip. Anyway, the plot is a little thin, but I think that's one of this movie's strong points, actually. It is impossible to be distracted from the romance of it, because the romance is all the movie has to offer.
A friend once pointed out to me the issue of the golden watch. When was it actually created?? She gives it to him in the present, but the only reason she has the watch is that he gave it to her in the past. Then again, the only reason HE had it in the past is that she gave it to him in the present. What does it all mean? Probably the writer just goofed, but somehow it adds to the movie's mystique.
Two thumbs up. Please check it out.",975369600,,1234,4.273504273504273
1362047,5,B00004W46I,"During it's release in 1980, ""Somewhere in Time"" was virtually ingnored by film audiences and widely panned by critics stating that the film was ""too sentimental"" and too corny.  I was a child when the film was first released so my only interest in viewing the film on cable was that ""Superman was in it and it's about time travel!"".  But what I saw was an innocent and sweet hearted film about love against all odds.  Viewing the film as an adult, I find the film even more touching and sad.
First the acting by Jane Seymore and Christopher Plummer is first rate.  I was suprised that Plummer was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar.  Christopher Reeve I believe recieved harsh criticism in 1980 for portraying a man completely vulnerable and desperate to find his one true love.  I believe post 1970's audiences and critics found his performance too corny while I found it true and earnest.  Reeve makes this film stronger than it would if it were cast with someone else.  His character has such conviction in love that he's able to travel through time with just his mind!  Reeve's performance makes that believeable.  I also believe it is because of Reeve that the film endures.  For Reeve fans this film may be more popular than even the first ""Superman"" film.
I cannot continue praise for this film without mentioning the music by John Barry.  His theme for ""Somewhere in Time"" is both haunting and sweet and sets a perfect tone for this movie.  The ""Somewhere in Time"" theme may be one of the most recognized movie themes ever.
I am pleased to find that this film has found a new popularity.  I believe that this film began a trend of more sentimental love stories which became very popular in the 80's and 90's.  Which brings me to a certain observation.  There are many similarities between this film and another tragic love story released in 1997.  THAT film became the highest grossing film in history, and it dealt with the same subject matter as ""Somewhere..""  Both ""Somewhere in Time"" and ""Titanic"" begin with an old lady thinking about the past, both films are set in 1912, the heroines in both films have a domineering figure in their lives, their love affair with the hero is brief but lasts forever, the heroes of both films die, and at the end of both films the lovers are reunited in a heavenly afterlife.
I feel it unfortunate that ""Somewhere in Time"" couldn't find praise when it was first released by film audiences as ""Titanic"" had.  But just as the characters found love years later in the film, people eventually found this film and fell in love with it and it will continue to touch people.",974592000,20,2622,4.612068965517241

It was wonderfully romantic and captivating. I am going to purchase it because I want to see it again and again. It reminded me of a book I once read called 'Time and time again', also in it's way a love story spanning a century. That love can be brief and yet so complete makes me realise that when one finds it, it can never be lost, it will return somehow. I have that sort of love, and seeing this movie made me so much more determined never to lose it. The Grand Hotel is where we intend to spend the most special time of our life, our honemoon...and what better place to seal a bond.",973900800,3,785,4.038461538461538
