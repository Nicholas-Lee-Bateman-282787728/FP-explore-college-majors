3001001,5,B000XCZGW2,"I loved this season.  I needed it to complete my collection and very much appreciate it being available.  Sometimes a person likes a series on TV and watches each week but then it ends and out of site out of mind.  Years later, however, it is with fond memories that that person returns and watches again, and this time with great enthusiasm because they can be watched at will and even interrupted and not missed.

3001005,5,B000XCZGW2,just what i wanted there are ten seasons and needed season 5 to fill the gap. great series and to watch all ten seasons in order is necessary for the series to make sence and to follow the flow of the characters and the story lines. could not have asked for a better series to watch. Some of the stories were almost predictable for the results but very entertaining.,1313107200,,366,4.318840579710145
3001006,5,B000XCZGW2,Another great season.  Relationships are explored in greater depth.  I loved the show and I loved the way what happened on the show reflected the climate in the military of the time.,1312848000,,182,4.65625
3001007,5,B000XCZGW2,Great show. If you like ncis or any of the csi shows you will like this as well. I had run out of new ncis or csi episodes and had never watched any of the jag shows. I got hooked right off. You might also. Vary good cast. A lot of action not just courtroom stuff. Try any episode and you will see what i did.,1311033600,4,309,3.696969696969697
3001018,5,B000XCZGW2,Absolutely fantastic! This show grabbed me in 1995 when it first came on. I was so depressed when it ended.,1289952000,,107,4.4

3001038,5,B000XCZGW2,this is one of my favorite seasons. i really liked the romance of mac and her aussie. knowing the actor died made it a little sad but i really liked this season. the best is yet to come. when harm adopts and becomes a parent he seems more real to me. so now i must get the next season..,1233619200,,286,3.864406779661017
3001039,5,B000XCZGW2,This is a great continuation of JAG. Bought it for my daughter who loves JAG.,1231286400,,77,4.2
3001040,5,B000XCZGW2,"I didn't watch Jag until it was in the 10th season. Recently I caught it on TV reruns and got totally hooked. I had to get the DVD's. Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.

I didn't think it would keep getting better and better but what can I say it does. Season 5 is no dissapointment. I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.

I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.

The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.

I cannot say enough good about this show. You will not be disappointed.",1231286400,,1008,4.261780104712042

3001043,5,B000XCZGW2,"Jag was, and is, such a great series.  The actors are impeccable with each person getting a chance to shine.  The writing is fantastic and really well thought out. I love dramas that have to do with the military and this series does not disappoint.  All of the actors, at some point, get a chance to shine.  Even though the series seemed to be mostly focused on Harm and Mac (David James Elliott and Catherine Bell), each character is given a chance to have a storyline.  I watched the show when it was on tv originally and I am so glad that they have released it on DVD.  Very good series.",1216857600,,590,4.27027027027027
3001044,4,B000XCZGW2,"As with other JAG season episodes, Season 6 was interesting and entertaining. The depiction of the NAVY and JAG is realistic while providing entertainment value worth viewing. I recommend this season to all.

3001058,5,B000XCZGW2,"JAG Season 5 offers great variety in character interactions and sets the stage for future seasons.  Harm's realization that Naval Aviation is not in his career future is a cathartic event in the series.  Mac's appearance in a bikini (presumably topless) is a cardiac event.  Brumby is at his best as a pest for Harm (rest his soul).  Altogether, it is an excellent way to spend some quality time (particularly for JAG fans).",1207094400,5,424,4.767123287671233

3001062,5,B000XCZGW2,"Incredible!!  I have purchased 4 seasons of JAG and they just get better. I enjoy it as much as when it was current TV years ago.  The Fifth Season was a wonderful time for the show in that Mic was introduced and Mac and Harm revealed their intimate feelings for each other (limited, of course).  It is a shame that a show of this caliber was discontinued.  It actually, in addition to being great viewing, has given me a better perspective and respect for the military and the job they do.  I know this is ""only"" TV, but some of the episodes represent activities that actually happen and portrays the ""real"" role served by the military forces of our great country. I hope the talent of David James Bell and others on the show is not being wasted.",1205539200,,747,4.384057971014493
3001063,5,B000XCZGW2,"For the first time they released the 5 season of Jag in Widescreen format only, I think they should have relesed it in both formats. the Six season which will be released on 5/20/08 is going to be released in both formats according to amazon's listing of it.",1205280000,,258,4.395833333333333
3001064,4,B000XCZGW2,"I have purchased Seasons 1-5 of JAG. Season 5 is, in my opinion, by far the best of these. Season 1 is exciting but occasionally overstretches, and Season 2 has an ill-matched partner for Harm (and...wait...aren't these guys lawyers?...there isn't a courtroom in sight!). In Season 3 Mac and other regulars comes on board but it takes a while for the actors to seem settled into their roles, Season 4 is getting better, and Season 5 is pretty darn awesome. The courtroom battles are diverse and raise interesting issues without being too preachy (unfulfilled promises from a recruiter, an overweight sailor who only flies a computer but is threatened with dishonorable discharge, an over-tired aviator who fails to bring in a fellow aviator safely, Harm is framed for Clinton-bashing...). The development of romantic relationships, especially Mic's and Mac's, is really enjoyable -- especially the always simmering hostility between Harm and Mic, and the unexpectedly frank, brief conversation between Harm and Mac about their own relationship). And a two-episode location shoot in Australia! As far as I recall, Season 6 was pretty darn good too, but for what's available now, Season 5 will stand up best to repeat viewing.

So why 4 stars? Where's the bonus features?! Come on, folks, not a single commentary? Not a single interview? The only ""bonus"" is a gag reel -- and I swear it's under 4 minutes. (I meant to double-check before writing this, but I'm pretty sure it was 3-something minutes.) Disappointing.",1204329600,2,1513,5.100806451612903

3001067,5,B000XCZGW2,"This as all of the other Jag's continues to wave the flag through dedication and perserverance to the country.  The episode, where Harm pushed the other Tomcat was another testimony of the type of men and women who are in the defense of our country.  It is too bad Jag went off the air, but, Jag lives on and will live on in the hearts and minds of those who have served, myself included, in the defense of this great nation.  Jag is a reminder of all that is good in this country.  I look forward to the future editions.  God bless the United States of America.",1204243200,2,562,4.214953271028038

3001079,4,B000XCZGW2,"The first season lacked a bit, but it has definitely improved with time.  The characters are great. Enjoy the relationships. One of the things I like best about this serious is that it portrays the military in a favorable light...as the heroes that they are. It is refreshing.  Some of the dialogue is a little cheesy and the plots a little predictable, but overall very enjoyable.",1204070400,,381,4.757575757575758
3001080,5,B000XCZGW2,This was one of the best shows on TV until S9 and S10.  It is a shame it did not get the credit and awards that lesser shows received.  S5 was one of the best seasons and S6 to be released in May is at the top of the list.  Paramount is being very stingy with extras.  Since there was a 7th DVD is this set due to there being 25 episodes they really could have had more than 3 minutes of bloopers or maybe put in some unused scenes.,1204070400,,432,3.7666666666666666

If you like Military genre shows then JAG will appeal to you. I especially love the episodes dealing with USN SEALS. I would of given it 5 stars, but only 4 simply because I found it annoying that the producers of the DVD didn't put much thought into the production.

3235537,5,B000XCZGW2,"I didn't watch Jag until it was in the 10th season. Recently I caught it on TV reruns and got totally hooked. I had to get the DVD's. Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.

I didn't think it would keep getting better and better but what can I say it does. Season 5 is no dissapointment. I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.

I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.

The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.

I cannot say enough good about this show. You will not be disappointed.",1231286400,,1008,4.261780104712042

I love dramas that have to do with the military and this series does not disappoint.  All of the actors, at some point, get a chance to shine.  Even though the series seemed to be mostly focused on Harm and Mac (David James Elliott and Catherine Bell), each character is given a chance to have a storyline.  I watched the show when it was on tv originally and I am so glad that they have released it on DVD.  Very good series.",1216857600,,590,4.27027027027027

3235555,5,B000XCZGW2,"JAG Season 5 offers great variety in character interactions and sets the stage for future seasons.  Harm's realization that Naval Aviation is not in his career future is a cathartic event in the series.  Mac's appearance in a bikini (presumably topless) is a cardiac event.  Brumby is at his best as a pest for Harm (rest his soul).  Altogether, it is an excellent way to spend some quality time (particularly for JAG fans).",1207094400,5,424,4.767123287671233

The Fifth Season was a wonderful time for the show in that Mic was introduced and Mac and Harm revealed their intimate feelings for each other (limited, of course).  It is a shame that a show of this caliber was discontinued.  It actually, in addition to being great viewing, has given me a better perspective and respect for the military and the job they do.  I know this is ""only"" TV, but some of the episodes represent activities that actually happen and portrays the ""real"" role served by the military forces of our great country. I hope the talent of David James Bell and others on the show is not being wasted.",1205539200,,747,4.384057971014493

3235561,4,B000XCZGW2,"I have purchased Seasons 1-5 of JAG. Season 5 is, in my opinion, by far the best of these. Season 1 is exciting but occasionally overstretches, and Season 2 has an ill-matched partner for Harm (and...wait...aren't these guys lawyers?...there isn't a courtroom in sight!). In Season 3 Mac and other regulars comes on board but it takes a while for the actors to seem settled into their roles, Season 4 is getting better, and Season 5 is pretty darn awesome. The courtroom battles are diverse and raise interesting issues without being too preachy (unfulfilled promises from a recruiter, an overweight sailor who only flies a computer but is threatened with dishonorable discharge, an over-tired aviator who fails to bring in a fellow aviator safely, Harm is framed for Clinton-bashing...). The development of romantic relationships, especially Mic's and Mac's, is really enjoyable -- especially the always simmering hostility between Harm and Mic, and the unexpectedly frank, brief conversation between Harm and Mac about their own relationship). And a two-episode location shoot in Australia! As far as I recall, Season 6 was pretty darn good too, but for what's available now, Season 5 will stand up best to repeat viewing.

So why 4 stars? Where's the bonus features?! Come on, folks, not a single commentary? Not a single interview? The only ""bonus"" is a gag reel -- and I swear it's under 4 minutes. (I meant to double-check before writing this, but I'm pretty sure it was 3-something minutes.) Disappointing.",1204329600,2,1513,5.100806451612903

The episode, where Harm pushed the other Tomcat was another testimony of the type of men and women who are in the defense of our country.  It is too bad Jag went off the air, but, Jag lives on and will live on in the hearts and minds of those who have served, myself included, in the defense of this great nation.  Jag is a reminder of all that is good in this country.  I look forward to the future editions.  God bless the United States of America.",1204243200,2,562,4.214953271028038
