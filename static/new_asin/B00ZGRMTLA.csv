7282364,1,B00ZGRMTLA,watching this show is extra fun when you play the did bill rape this actress game. every time an attractive actress comes on screen you take a shot if bill raped her,1439078400,39,165,4.1875
7282365,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"Mill Creek is releasing A Complete Series compilation. Hopefully, it is of better quality than the First Look Stuudios release. I have recently bought two Mill Creek sets to replace the defective ones from First Look. They are piled one on top of another. I will probably buy DVD cases that hold multiple discs. Despite the recent exposure of Mr. Cosby as a less than honorable person, this was a great series. If I had not bought the other sets to replace the defective discs, I would buy this one.  Enjoy the show for its portrayal of black family life. I will be interested to read other reviews after the September release.",1438473600,39,627,4.598214285714286
7282366,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"One of the greatest shows ever with one of the hardest working men (Bill Cosby) that prove you can make it from nothing to something the right way. Of all the shows, I believe The Cosby Show is one of the best even though I have seen every episode at least a 20 times! It just does not get old and it is so appealing even after all of these years of the same episodes.  Every part was purely gold when I think about this show there was funny one liners, witty comebacks, excellent acting, Family orientated fun environment, serious issues addressed, and the characters were awesome.

""The Cosby Show"" dominated the tv for a majority of the 80s. The Huxtables were a big family consisting of obstetrician Cliff and his lawyer wife Claire, their daughters Sondra, Denise, Vanessa and Rudy, and son Theo.

The show was based on the standup comedy of Bill Cosby and could always make me feel good. I would always love when this rare quality creation would grace the tv with its presence and would find myself watching it all the time!!!  Even though this was a comedy it addressed many big serious topics like teen pregnancy and much more with good morales.

White black whatever you were, you wanted to be a Huxtable, and I think that's part of the appeal of the show it appealed to everyone and was at the heart of families with a comedic twist.

This is another classic that will continue in the heart of anyone who has gone through the 80s-90s (reruns)",1435536000,79,1452,4.481060606060606

What matters is I got his complete series.  Since they won't allow his reruns on tv no more.....

He was well liked, and Cosby show was great.
Made our whole family laughing!!
His TV wife was good to.
The kids are  hilarious

7282411,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"I'm what they call a ""millennial"" and I LOVE this show.  I love the humor and the values that it teaches and the storytelling.

As for Cosby's recent conviction, it doesn't matter if you agree with the verdict or not, this is still a good show and celebrating the positive impact a person had does not mean you agree with everything a person does.  And aside from Cosby, there is a whole team of people behind the scenes, and other characters in the show who deserve recognition for their work.  So as TV networks and streaming services continue to take this show off the air, pleas consider purchasing these episodes to watch whenever you want.",1524787200,8,645,4.582608695652174

I think it's a brilliant series in terms of healthy family relationships. It's great fun to watch the adventures of these characters. It is a series sensitive to struggles, supportive, non-shaming , and encouraging. It is big on equal rights and problem solving and dealing with children of different ages, and the adult relationships don't get lost in the shuffle of all the kids. I am grateful I could find it online. I have been watching episodes every night since I received the series and and I am very happily entertained.",1523577600,7,642,4.741071428571429

7282422,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"It was a real struggle for me to decide to buy this show for my family after all the allegations re: Bill Cosby lately.  In the end I decided the good in the show--role models of successful, educated Black folk still being Black folk, was important enough, that the rest could be handled with a conversation about how a flawed human is just that, and we can still appreciate the good that came from that human, as long as we don't dismiss the bad.  The one does not compensate for the other, but the other does not wipe out the one, either.  Parsing complexity is hard for black kids , with police shootngs, etc.  Having positive examples to harken back to really, really matters.",1521763200,11,680,4.459677419354839

The packaging is a little odd though, in the set I received, there are 4 discs in each case and they are stacked one on top of the other, instead of 2 on each side of the case. I can see these getting scratched easily. Anyway....seasons 1-4 are my favorite. Season 5 the show starts go get boring, I found myself fast forwarding through multiple episodes because the story line was slow and uninteresting. I also dislike the way the show jumps so far ahead between seasons. Season 3 or 4 ends with Sondra and Elvin as newly weds and the next season starts with Sondra about to give birth! One season ended with theo in high school and then the next one started with him leaving for college. It's been so long since I've seen the show that at first I thought there must have been missing episodes. I just started season 6 which is when Martin & Olivia join the family and I'm starting to lose interest even more.",1498435200,,1045,4.256281407035176

The Cosby Show, rated solely on what you see on screen, is a solid program. Especially compared to a lot of crap that gets aired these days.

Kid and adult friendly. The whole cast has great chemistry, and whatever else you can say about Bill, he's hilarious and has a gift for comedic timing. $28 well spent.",1487894400,6,579,4.611650485436893

7282547,3,B00ZGRMTLA,"I jumped at the price and admittedly didn't read any reviews or specs (so unlike me!).  So imagine my disappointment when I pop in the DVD and see that it's in 480p(!), with no option for subtitles, and no closed captioning!  Like a few others have mentioned, the discs are not in a case but rather, in eight (8) cardboard sleeves (two discs per sleeve) for each season, encased in a lid-type box...yeah.  Not the best packaging, but as long as you handle the discs properly, there shouldn't be any damage.  The DVDs themselves all play well with no problems.  But 16 discs in SD (the horror! lol) with NO closed captioning or subtitles?  Those are some pretty big cons for me.

""The Cosby Show"" was one of the greatest sitcoms in American television history, as well as one of my personal favorites.  This show won a Peabody, a Golden Globe, and Emmy awards, and was a top-rated show all eight years it was on the air from 1984-1992.  Due to Bill Cosby's recent legal troubles, the reruns were pulled from the air, hence the demand for this show.  It's a bloody shame--this is a culturally significant show among the likes of ""I Love Lucy"", another classic, ground-breaking American sitcom.

TCS was also a relevant show for America as a whole.  There were not many portrayals of the different sectors of the African-American experience--you saw a poor family living in a housing project ""Good Times"" and a rags-to-riches story with ""The Jeffersons"", but the overwhelming images you saw of Blacks prior to TCS were downtrodden folks living in poverty, committing crimes, uneducated, etc.  So here was the educated, white-collar, upper middle class Huxtables raising their five children in a Brooklyn brownstone with so much humor, style, and inclusivity...wow!  I feel that the Huxtables were a great representation of Blacks who definitely existed but were often underrepresented, just a great showcase of The American Dream overall.

Moreover than that, it was just classic comedy featuring the doting patriarch, doctor Cliff (Bill Cosby); the regal, witty, and loving attorney wife and mom Clair (Phylicia Rashad); daughters Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), Denise (Lisa Bonet), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam), and son Theo (Malcolm Jamal Warner).  Each of the characters are someone you know--which was part of the reason why this show is so beloved.  It transcends race, class, or creed--this is a show about family and all the joy and laughter that comes along with it.",1482969600,6,2496,4.975903614457831

So every two disc make up a season.

You get a total of 16 disc containing 12 episodes of the show on each disc. I will insert pictures of this later. My one and only problem with the boxing is Mill Creek entertainment, could have done better with this  boxing of this tv show compared to other tv Shows ... with the likes of Roseanne and Married With Children.

Anyway, I love this DVD set of all the Cosby Show seasons. Watching re-runs of this fabulous and epic show brings back the sweet old days and simpler times of the 80's and 90's. And of course brings back lots of beautiful childhood memories of watching this awesome show with my family. It's super funny, filled wholesome fun, teaches everyone especially kids great values, and is very comforting. Today's t.v. is garbage and the opposite of fine and classic television shows and cartoons. That's why I live in the past by watching great classic shows like this. Bill Cosby or Heathcliff Huxtable will always be one of my favorite T.V. dads and is like a father to me. I loved watching the Cosbys every Thursday night back in the late 80's when I was only 1 and 2 years old and having a great loving time with my mom, dad, and big bro. I call shows like this comfort t.v. What a great price for all the eight seasons of The Cosby Show and a great quality DVD set. To me and to many other people, Bill Cosby will someday leave behind a legacy of giving laughter and love to so many people. The Cosby Show and many other pieces of classic t.v. are rare gems and are filled with beautiful memories and there will never be any other shows like them made today that will ever capture the joy and love that they all brought and still bring to so many people around the world. A+ for this D.V.D set definitely.",1471996800,3,1572,4.386986301369863

7282629,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"I love this show.  Bill Cosby was a ladies man, but doesn't deserve to have his career and legacy ruined as most of those women were found to have been lying and there is no evidence other than their word, which many of them waited 30 years to say anything and it was confirmed Cosby wasn't even in the same state at the time they claimed they were raped.

Everything about the man disgusts me!! The thought of him doing the things he has been accused of, that he somehow thought the women 'LIKED IT' or 'WANTED IT;  is inconceivable (that nasty ole man with the warts all over his face!!) and knowing he testified that he'd bought drugs to give to women he wanted to have sex with, and the fact that his wife of 52 YEARS has testified that she has NO OPINION about all the women her husband violated and the love child that he had and paid to support for years.. She is doing all she can to see that her husband isn't found guilty of all that he has been charged with doing. Bill Cosby is a worthless nothing and his wife doesn't have a shred of honor!!

How can we know all that Bill Cosby has done to women and then sit and enjoy seeing him in this series when much of what he has been accused of occurred during that time frame!!",1463961600,15,1051,4.198019801980198

7282690,5,B00ZGRMTLA,"I love the Cosby show, but was it the entire CAST that committed this act or Cosby himself? Why punish the entire cast? If your friends were involved in a criminal activity and you weren't but because you talked to them on the phone you were arrested too, you would be mad. Why punish ALL OF THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES FOR HIS MISTAKES. The show was great!! This is one show that greatly encourage respect and education all in one. We cannot find shows nowaday that even honor parents or encourages education.  He who is without sin, let HIM cast the first stone.  Cosby did not make a show only with himself, talking to himself, and himself being the only actor. we have to think of everyone else that was involved in the making of this show. I read how someone took all there Cosby Show DVDs  and threw them out, I understand the compassion for the victims, but we must always remember those who were on TV with him did not condone those acts, so I Would SaY lets be fair to the entire cast. don't throw the baby in with the bathwater.",1455408000,50,1035,4.324742268041237

The packaging is a little odd...I was expecting the usual DVD package, you know, looks like a book, you open it and the discs are there, each on its own ""page"", however many there are. Well this one has a ""sleeve"" for each season, two discs per season, they're all separate sleeves, held in a two-part box. You lift up the cover, the part with the title and photos, and the bottom holds the sleeves. It works, it holds all the DVDs...it's just different from what I expect for DVDs. But then, that's part of the marketing of these things, do something to make it stand out. I know that right now it's probably ""politically incorrect"" to be interested in watching the Cosby Show, what with Mr. Cosby's potential criminal charges, but I enjoyed this show, it is an award-winning show and it should be allowed to continue to be enjoyed for what it is.

All the stations that decided to remove the show were wrong. I am sure there are others in the business who have some things about them that haven't come out yet. Then there are those who have and are still making movies, starring on TV, making music and excelling in sports and are still accepted and making money. No one is perfect.

7282783,4,B00ZGRMTLA,"I bought the complete series when it first was released by First Look Entertainment back in 2008(?).  I wanted to relive my childhood whenever I wanted like everybody else.  That said, it is still a great show.  Sadly, I think people need to wake up and smell the brew of reality. Bill Cosby the man is a slime ball.  In the 2005 sealed deposition that was released over the Summer, when asked by the opposing attorney if Cosby ever obtained & gave drugs to women for the purpose of having sex with them, Bill Cosby Said YES!  I think people need to be aware of something.  NONE!  of the sitcoms of 50s, 70s, 80s or even 90s ever claimed to portray the reality of family life.  I will be the first to admit that until the day I die, I will always wished I couldve have been a 7th Brady, a ninth Bradford, or a member of The Tanner Family.  Those families are too idyllic, and cannot be created in real life. Heck all the actors who were part of a TV family had troubled personal lives when their shows ended.  Robert Reed turned out to be a gay man in his private life.  Adam Rich. Nicholas Bradford had a drug problem after Eight is Enough ended, and sadly, Bill Cosby turns out to be a sexual predator even in his old age.  It shouldnt take away the legacy of the The Cosby Show.  Those of you who think it does, I would like to leave you with something to ponder?  Do any of you think that you could raise your children to act like a Brady,  a Huxtable, or a Bradford all the time?  Good luck",1444435200,4,1495,4.156794425087108

This is the most disastorously packed set of DVD's that I have ever seen. Each slipcase holds two DVD's, and if you are not careful, they will slip out of the primary holder all over the floor.

I haven't binged yet, just watched one disc so hopefully the quality will reign thru with all the remaining CDs. The price was fair so I got one for myself & another for a friend.

He falls in line with a lot of the great male actors, so if you don't buy his stuff, there is a long list of many older and modern actors you should not follow either or support.  Same with polititians, athletes, and musicians.  A matter of fact,  to be consistent,  you should not watch most anything sports, entertainment,  or political as there is almost always someone who has lied, cheated,  raped, stolen, even some murderers on the screen all the time.

I personally feel that all these women coming forward is very convenient. It's been a very long time since the majority of them claim to have been taken advantage of. The deposition everyone is talking about only proves he made a mistake once and that he is human. It sounds to me like women want to make sure they get a share of his money before he dies, being that he is getting older, and dragging his reputation through the mud while in the process.
