1781461,5,B00006JDQF,"We had a hand-me-down copy of Raffi's first video on VHS and wore it out within a few months.  I bought the DVD of all three concerts and my son has been watching it almost daily ever since.  He loves it.  He knows all the songs and we sing them together when we go for walks.  Now he wakes me up in the morning and asks me to take out my guitar and sing and play the songs with him.  Raffi has given us a way to introduce our son to music as well as providing another thing to enjoy together, even if we aren't actually watching the concert.",1152316800,7,542,3.9357798165137616
1781462,5,B00006JDQF,"Both of my kids love Raffi.  We have a DVD player in the car and often times I will put this in and we will just listen to it.  If my 2 year old is ever having fits about getting in his seat I ask if he wants Raffi--he always squeals ""yes"" and gets in his seat.  He has learned many new words and sings almost all the songs just from listening to this DVD.  He loves to clap with the kids after each song too.  My 5 year old daughter would watch this on repeat for hours if I let her.  She loves Raffi and knows every song by heart.  Excellent purchase that won't wear the parents out.  I even like the songs.",1134345600,13,609,3.8548387096774195
1781463,5,B00006JDQF,"If you are a Raffi fan, then this DVD is a must have--and a fantastic bargain, to boot.  It contains 3 concerts, previously only available on separate videos:

*A Young Children's Concert with Raffi* - Raffi solo; filmed in 1984.

*Raffi in Concert with the Rise & Shine Band* - Raffi accompanied by a four-piece band; filmed in 1988.

*Raffi on Broadway* - Raffi accompanied by a keyboardist and a bass player; filmed in 1993.

Of the three concerts, my 2 year-old son's (and my own) favorite is probably the first one, *A Young Children's Concert*, since it features Raffi performing solo on a simple stage, in the smallest venue of the three shows.

The first two concerts feature many of Raffi's beloved and signature songs, such as ""Baby Beluga,"" ""The More We Get Together,"" and ""Shake My Sillies Out.""  The last concert (filmed at the Gershwin Theatre in NYC) showcases several of Raffi's environmentally conscious works, and has a bit of a theatrical flavor to it.

In all three shows, Raffi sounds almost exactly as he does on his albums.  His love and respect for children shine through in his lyrics; his interaction with and attitude toward his young audience; and the sheer joy that infuses his performances.

The sound and image quality of all three concerts are great, considering their age.  The concert footage is nicely shot and edited.  The DVD menu interface is simple and straightforward:  you can access each concert, and either play the show in its entirety or select individual songs from that performance.  There are no annoying ads or previews at the start of the DVD.

One bonus feature I would like to have seen is a ""sing-along"" option, but even without that feature, the DVD is fabulous.  For me, it was worth buying (and giving five stars) just for the first 2 concerts.

Since the Amazon listing doesn't include the set lists for each concert, I've included them below (as listed on the DVD insert).

I bought this dvd to watch, with my children,4 and almost 2. They both love it and can't get enough of it. I love it because, its not violent, the songs are just as great as I remember them, and funny enough Baby Beluga is still one of my favorites, and now my kids love it too.

Found the Raffi Concert on YouTube that her mommy watched when she was little. Worked like a charm. Little Miss sat through the entire forty minutes, totally entranced. I ordered this video so that she can watch it on a large screen. Now all of us who love her know that if she gets to that super-fussy stage, pull out her Raffi video. Calm prevails.

1781501,5,B00006JDQF,One of the only DVDs my son can sit and listen to entirely! I watched the VHF version growing up so I knew most of the songs and can't help but sing along with them still. I despise the wiggles...so for a hippie with a Hawaiian shirt and moccasins I can handle him. My son now claps and wobbles to most of the songs even tries to humm a few of them at 15months old.,1430438400,,365,3.88

1781523,5,B00006JDQF,"I remember watching these concerts when I was a child, on VHS back then. So I showed them to my son, and he has LOVED watching the Young Children's Concert and the Sunshine Band concert since he was about a year old. He even follows along with the songs with actions, i.e. clapping his hands, stomping his feet, ""brushing"" his teeth. I really like that they're very simple-just Raffi and the band playing onstage. He has a soothing voice that even my three-month-old daughter enjoys!",1420329600,,483,4.694117647058824

Michael, my 31 year old son, has autism and cognitive disabilities - the simple tunes combined with Raffi's great personality help him to focus and calm whenever the storms of his disability rage.  Raffi starts to sing and a little smile breaks out on Michael's face immediately.  I breathe a sigh of relief and settle in for some ""Raffi time"".",1414713600,,468,4.470588235294118

1781540,5,B00006JDQF,"this is one of the easiest reviews I have ever done. My kids watched, and sang along with Raffi back in the 90s when he was just breaking through. We owned all 3 of these on VHS. Now I bought these-all 3 on one disc with remastered (I believe) vid and sound. Either way its a pure Joy seeing Lil grand kids bouncing and dancing and totally captivated by the songs of Raffi all over again. Things DO come full circle. <G> It is a VERY rare situation with someone like Raffi whom is absolutely a man of God and conviction whom truly loves and respects children. They learn about hygiene, counting, getting along with others, and being good stewards of the world we live in---all encapsulated within songs that are at the same time familiar (even when they're not) and so catchy that one can not help tapping feet, clapping hands and singing along. Recommended for anyone of any faith, with little kids from 1 yr...up to the BIG big kids called grandpas and grandmas!!! oops. that would be me <G>  You'd be hard pressed to find a better/higher quality programming for kids.

I now have a new grandson (2 years old) who was recently diagnosed with autism.  We found that the music and repetition of Raffi's songs absolutely delight him!  He is now singing along with Raffi and imitating his actions - a real accomplishment for an autistic child.",1385337600,,395,4.764705882352941
1781553,5,B00006JDQF,"I never heard of Raffi until I had a child.  This guy is just great with kids.  A visual concert is much better than just a CD.  And this DVD is obviously the way to go - 2 1/2 hours of concert footage on 1 DVD.  There are 3 separate concerts here, and frankly they don't get better as time goes on.  They get more slick, but that's not what really appeals to toddlers.  The first one is the most intimate and most engaging.  By the 3rd one, he's added electric bass, etc, and it all starts to sound like he's talking to too big of an audience, and it gets a tad awkward.  But anyway, the overall value here is amazing, and will keep your child happily and healthily occupied.

1781556,5,B00006JDQF,Would put this movie in for my son when he was a little younger and he would just chill and fall asleep to it. It was a savior during teething.,1380067200,,143,3.8
1781557,4,B00006JDQF,"The first two shows on this disc are classics. My son has watched them repeatedly with little evidence of flagging attention. Most of the songs are great and Raffi and his musicians are obviously having a good time. The banter between songs is casual--there is a pleasant feeling of familiarity and flow.

The third show, On Broadway, is mediocre by comparison. For this show, he chose an accompaniment of keyboard and bass alone, which can't do the songs justice, and the musicians themselves don't have the charm either or Raffi or his 4 bandmates in the Rise and Shine band. Alone with a guitar, Raffi works. With a band, he also works. In this in-between state, something is definitely lacking. The choice of largely second-rate songs is hard to understand, considering the importance he gives to his venue. Additionally, the show seems over-rehearsed and lacks any element of spontaneity.

Unfortunately, the video quality is relatively poor--probably because it's overcompressed to fit on a single disc. Some grain is understandable considering the eighties sources of the first two shows, but it's actually distracting. I expected better quality when I purchased this disc, something better than the pixellated videos found on You-Tube. I was disappointed.

These criticisms shouldn't detract from the excellence of the first two shows, which are worth the price of the disc, which continues to be played regularly in my house. Perhaps buying the first two shows on their own would be more satisfying: it would eliminate the distractions of the mediocre Broadway show, and maybe (although not certainly) leave the shows less compressed and thus give them a better picture quality.

1781589,5,B00006JDQF,"This DVD is a pretty nice buy.  I remember watching the ""Young Children's concert"" as a small kid and loving it.  Now, I'm sharing my childhood favorite with my daughter, and she absolutely loves it.  She's only 5 months old and she literally squeals with delight and giggles nonstop over this DVD (I started playing it for her when she was about 4 months).  I like the simplistic quality of the concerts (no over-the-top fancy lasers or overdone gimmicks) as the focus is mainly on the music and engaging the kids to have a good time.  My personal favorite of the three concerts is ""A Young Children's Concert"".  That one just has Raffi singing and playing his guitar (I find him the most engaging in this one).  The other two, Raffi is joined by a music band (keyboard, drums, extra guitar).  The ""Rise and Shine"" and ""Raffi on Broadway"" repeat a number of songs from ""A Young Children's Concert"", but also introduce some new/different songs.  This is nice, because it provides the similar songs my daughter loves while also changing it up a little, so I don't lose my sanity.  This DVD is also a great deal for the price, and it's all on one disk (nice space saver).  The DVD is also very well organized (if you remember which song you stopped on, you can find and go directly to that song later from the menu).  Each concert is about 45-60 minutes long (a decent legnth... not too long or too short).  I would recommend this DVD mainly for smaller children (toddler up through kindergarten); I beleive older children might not hold as much interest as a younger group.  If you're not sure about this product or any of Raffi's works, you might be able to find a sample of his work on youtube (or something like that).  If you like it, then I highly recommend buying the DVD (it's really worth owing, if you decide you like it).  I hope this review proved to be helpful in your purchasing decision.",1280793600,2,1900,4.511695906432749

We gave away all the toddler stuff.  Then came a surprise almost six years after.  Now she loves Raffi as much as the rest of them did.  Her mom already knows the lyrics to most of the songs, so she can have Raffi in the car, the bedroom, the bath, as well as on TV.

Excellent songs;  excellent venues; excellent getting together time.

She was very familiar with the songs in the first concert (mostly childhood classics) & initially would only watch that one. However, once she watched the other two, she became hooked & knows every song. Raffi's songs are not only fun and catchy, but also touch on important social/environmental issues (hence my 3-year-old telling her grandmother about the declining population of Beluga whales :)

He is 15 months and loves the first two but looses some interest in the On Broadway Concert.

There is alot of repetition of songs though they are similar renditions, it would have been nice if he had added more of the songs he recorded on cassette/DVD instead(though understandable seeing as how these are live concert recordings) but it wouldn't keep me from buying another.
