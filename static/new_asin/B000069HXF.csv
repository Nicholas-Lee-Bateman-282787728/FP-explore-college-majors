1732159,5,B000069HXF,It has everything a comedy should have. The charactors are funny yet rememberable. The situations and plots had me laughing the entire time.,1204934400,,140,5.130434782608695
1732160,5,B000069HXF,"I am finding the US version looking and stating run times different from the UK releases on Amazon.  It states US actors playing the roles, which in fact is not true.  So, here are the actual episode names for Volume 2:

1. The Clock
2. Cold Comfort
3. The Think Tank
4. Big Brother
5. Hoorah For The Holidays

All episodes are 5 star comedy.",1185840000,,342,4.2153846153846155
1732161,5,B000069HXF,"Classic ensemble acting with witty writing--believable characters behaving believably, as real people do.  In other words, from time to time making damn fools of themselves and each other.  Who would imagine that a department store setting could, would offer such a rich array of comic and comedic possibilities.  Pure genius.  The only negative: inclusion of an idiotic, irritating ""laugh track"".  Why do the people who market these products think we need the prompting of idiots cackling and hee-hee-ing (usually at the wrong or irrelevant times and places in the action)?  They've spoiled another brilliant English comedy, too, ""Keeping UP Appearances"" with the same unnecessary and irritating insertions.  But if this irritation can be overlooked, or somehow tuned out by the listening ear, then ""Are You Being Served"" will serve well anyone seeking intelligent comedy conveyed by wit, comedic verve, and superb ensemble stage interactions.",1176163200,,944,5.513888888888889
1732162,4,B000069HXF,We have enjoyed many of these DVDs over the years. This is everybit as good.,1168819200,,76,4.133333333333334
1732163,5,B000069HXF,"Every episode in this ""Classic"" second year of ""Are you being served?"" is a gem. This comedy depends on the characters being sterotyped: from ""battle ax"" Mrs. Slocombe to ""sexpot"" Miss Brahms to Mr. Humphries (the hysterical ""queen"" of the bunch) to the ""dullard"" Mr. Rumbold (the perplexed head of the department) to the ""pompous"" ""Captain"" Peacock to the ""cheeky"" (as described by Mrs. Slocombe) Mr. Lucas to the ""socialist worker"" Mr. Mash to the ""dotty"" Mr. Granger, who is constantly falling asleep until Mr. Humphries uses his signature line, ""Are you Free, Mr. Granger""? in his campy voice.

The fun is watching the characters interact. The plots are very funny. This is not ""high"" English comedy. They use prat falls, unsophisticated humour and you love every minute of it.

WLIW runs the series on cable, so you can check it out before you buy the second year DVD.

Put your brains on pause and just sit down and laugh out loud.",1156809600,7,937,4.771604938271605
1732164,5,B000069HXF,"Every episode of the classic years of ""Are You Being Served?"" is a treasure.  When you buy something on DVD, there is the possibility that one will tire of it after awhile and roll their eyes whenever they catch that program on TV.

Not so with this classic BBC comedy.

""The Clock"" is the cast at their best, ""Cold Comfort"" will leave you in stitches at the way the staff tries to beat the cold weather, ""Big Brother"" will keep you laughing at how the staff gets back at good ol' Rumbold for using security cameras in the store to try to deter theft (there are two more episodes on the DVD).

I'm usually not one for DVD extras (they tend to take the magic away) but I was interested in the backgrounds of the actors and actresses.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how well-accomplished they all were and continue to be as well as the episode trivia.  And the fact that there are five episodes on each DVD gives you more value for your dollar.",1141689600,5,946,4.31638418079096
1732165,5,B000069HXF,"I've watched this show for several years but never get tired of it. Great cast, excellent lines, wonderful humour. British comedy at its best.",1121817600,,142,4.958333333333333
1732166,5,B000069HXF,"Every Are You Being Served fan should buy both box sets of these hilarious series but, if one is only willing to purchase one DVD, this is it!  IMO, three of the all-time best episodes are on volume 2 as well as 3 other excellent shows.  There is not one weak episode on here.  My favorite is ""Big Brother"" where Mr. Rumbold installs a hidden camera in the department to find a shop lifter but, instead, spies on the staff including counting how many times Mrs. Slocombe visits the powder room, what Mr. Grainger eats behind the counter, and what Captain Peacock does to Miss Brahms ""nether regions.""  My second favorite is ""Cold Comfort"" when Grace Brothers decides to turn off the store heating system to conserve energy during the fuel crisis leading to some very innovative methods to stay warm in the men's department.  ""The Clock"" is also excellent when Mr. Grainger, fearing he will be given the customary retirement clock during his 37th anniversary party, hears a ""cuckoo"" in Mr. Rumbold's office.  The other episodes are also tops: ""The Think Tank"" where the staff puts on a trial fashion show in the hopes to improve sales, ""Hoorah for the Holidays"" when Young Mr. Grace presents the staff with paid-for vacation options that may not even be worth the price, and ""Hand of Fate"" when promotion rumors are flying and Mr. Humphries palm-reading skills are put to the test. I'm warning you, though, once you've see this DVD, you are going to want MORE!",1071619200,16,1459,4.701960784313726
1732180,5,B000069HXF,I love this series. I had them all on vhs and now working to get them in this format. Such a funny show. Anyone who wants to laugh at a very funny Brit com should watch these shows.,1451952000,,181,3.789473684210526

1732189,5,B000069HXF,"Are You Being Served has seen time on American televisions courtesy of PBS.  Sadly, the folks who watch PBS do not make up the viewing masses and those poor folks (the ones who DON'T watch PBS) are/were missing out on some great comedy.

John Inman's over the top performance of Mr. Humphries is one of the things that would draw new watchers to this program.  But it's not just the John Inman Show.  The entire cast makes this series work.  If Captain Peacock were to be sent elsewhere, anarchy and chaos would reign.  Mrs. Slocum would battle head to head with Mr. Lucas or Mr. Grainger, if he were awake.

This is top notch writing, directing and acting.  If you do not or cannot laugh while watching this disc, you might want to contact the police about your missing sense of humor.",1403827200,,786,4.485915492957746
