8171802,5,B000MTEFVY,The best drama series ever for TV and it is well worth the purchase price to have this collection of classic shows!,1272240000,,115,4.2727272727272725
8171803,4,B000MTEFVY,"I have to say all the seasons of ER are great.  I have always loved the show and probably never missed more than a handful when they were originally telecast and even if I did see them all its great fun to see all the old characters.  I especially love Dr. Romano, or love to hate him that is.  I am watching the season where Dr. Green gets sick and I have to admit seeing it again is still sad.

If you love drama and intensity than ER is always a safe buy.",1216339200,,458,3.89247311827957
8171804,5,B000MTEFVY,"I really wish more shows were like ER, especially those things on tv now called ""medical dramas."" Right. None of those shows can compare to the one that really started the whole phenomenon and got people interested in medicine in the most brilliant, and often heart breaking, ways. For me, ER was it's best from season 6-8, and even if the later seasons are completely different from the old school stuff, it's still the best.

I have never once thought an episode of this show was corny or overdone, and I have been touched in all sorts of ways multiple times. Clearly you don't understand the emotions of life an death if you think showing a woman dying of cancer, or a child who lost both parents in a freak accident, could ever be over-dramatic.",1192233600,2,749,4.548148148148148
8171805,5,B000MTEFVY,"This show is one of the best ever.  Brilliant writing and incredible cast work.  The stories are real and intense, seemingly every episode outdoes the previous one.  Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, Sherry Stringfield, Eriq La Salle and Noah Wyle are all amazing in their roles, even as the original cast diminishes, the new members do great at keeping the feeling and intensity of the show alive.  I wish I would have watched this show from the beginning but I'm glad I can relive it on DVD, can't wait for season 8!",1185062400,4,537,4.741935483870968
