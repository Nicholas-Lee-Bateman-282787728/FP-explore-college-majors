8047042,5,B0007DBB80,"After suffering from heel pain for over a year, made worse by an overzealous orthopedic surgeon and his ""non-invasive"" Ossitron, I started desperately trolling Amazon for more information. This DVD-set was the first item I clicked on, and it has been a Godsend. However, God helps those who help themselves, and for this rescue program to work, you must work it--which means taking the time to stretch longer and more often than any doctor has probably told you to. The instruction is lucid, organized, and encouraging. The timetables for seeing improvement are realistic. I could hardly put any weight on my right foot last August, and now I'm hiking again. Buy it, follow the protocol, and little by little you'll get better!",1295136000,,727,4.967213114754099
8047043,5,B0007DBB80,"Wish I'd had this DVD set when my first foot developed p.f. Just got this today and sat through the whole set. It is and will be a remarkable help for me. I've already ordered all of the extras so I'm ready to go with my exercises, taping, etc. As I am not an MD; it would not be possible for me to figure out which extras I really need to bring my feet back to optimum health without this info. Love this set.",1195171200,,410,3.892857142857143
8047044,4,B0007DBB80,"I found this 2 DVD set to be exactly what I was looking for. A friend who has had plantar fasciitis had recommended it, as well as a physical therapist. It was very informative and showed me what I needed to do to take care of my  foot problems. After three weeks of using the program, an x-ray revealed better-looking tissue. I am more comfortable walking, too. The accompanying heel spur will take much longer to get rid of, but this DVD has shown me how to take care of my feet so that I can get out and be active once again after allowing my injuries to heal properly.",1171152000,3,572,4.2
8047045,3,B0007DBB80,"If I had the choice I would not buy this DVD again. All the information on the DVD is available on the net for free. The first video was well done. The second DVD was ok, but I have to say the guy doing the stretches is a little wierd. All in all, if you know nothing about plantar fasciitis then this DVD is not too bad, but if you have already researched no need for the DVD. I was hoping for some additional information but none to be found.",1125187200,13,444,3.9444444444444446
8047046,5,B0007DBB80,"I have had planter fasciitis for  over a year now, and went to see a doctor about it.  His immediate solution was cortizone shots in my heels...which helped temporarily, but did not solve the problem.  I didn't understand what the cause of this injury was and how to fix it long term.  I came across this video and it has helped me so much.  I now know why I keep hurting my planters, and I was given tools to make the pain go away.  I found it very easy to understand and learned how to think about this injury differently, and can treat it on my own.  Recovering from this is a long term deal, and the dvd provided me with practices that were easy to adopt and are effective.  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who has heel pain, active in sports or running (even before you have planter fasciitis), and sports medicine professionals...",1110240000,3,842,4.352564102564102
8047047,5,B0007DBB80,"This is an excellent, step-by-step guide for dealing with plantar fasciitis. I've had this problem for about a year and hadn't done much about it.  As it became increasingly painful, I finally went to my health care provider who gave me a few tips about what to do. Then I was lucky enough to find out about this set of comprehensive materials which helped me understand what causes plantar fasciitis and laid out a number of steps I could take to address it. The DVD is simple to follow, provides clear illustrations and guidance from professionals on stretching, taping, and icing techniques, identifies appropriate footwear and supports, and encourages the viewer to learn and stick with a new regimen over the time it takes for the foot to heal - and beyond.  I have followed its recommendations very closely and fully expect to reach the point where I am pain free. I am very grateful!! I HIGHLY recommend this program to anyone who has plantar fasciitis and wants to be rid of it!",1109203200,6,986,4.69364161849711
8047048,5,B0007DBB80,"I've told all my friends about this DVD.  It is well

organized and easy to follow.  There is so much

information in here that I never got during a visit to

the doctor.",1109116800,2,170,4.03030303030303
