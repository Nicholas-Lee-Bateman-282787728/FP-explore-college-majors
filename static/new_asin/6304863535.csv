The animation isn't quite up to  the first movie, but this movie is very good.  If I had to choose, I'd  probably choose the first one, but this is definatly a great movie, too.  Some of the voices are different, but they are still good.  With a zany  villian, this movie is a must!",969235200,,391,4.485714285714286

It is also sad for what Tenchi does to Ryoko, but in the end  Tenchi still deeply cares for her. Great cast and villians!",969062400,,283,4.203703703703703

950267,5,6304863535,"I do not know too much about the Tenchi Muyo series, but after seeing the first Tenchi movie and the second, I have to say I am intrigued by it. The background consisting of a guy who lives in a house with several women who  all want him turns out to be pretty cool.  The second movie is also  incredibly funny! Great touch with Myuka wanting to be with her  ""daddy"" in the bathtub.  The first two movies, the second  especially really make me have to look into the series.",944524800,4,473,4.2
950348,5,6304863535,"I watched this movie once and I wasn't sure myself if I liked it or not. The animation was very similar, as in Tenchi in Tokyo(Shin Tenchi). I watched it a second time with my friend and then I realized how great the movie was! The plot is good and not hard to understand. The music was teriffic, as well as the sound effects! There's 1 new character named Mayuka and I liked her a lot. The scenes between her and Ryoko are the best! The movie is only 60 minutes long but in a way that's good;it's not too long where it gets to the point that you want it to end. I think anyone who watches this movie should watch it a second time. But that's just my personal opinion^_-. If you watch the dub listen to Yazuha's voice...that's Reta Rapulsa from Power Rangers you hear...",994636800,2,770,4.20945945945946

950350,4,6304863535,"I liked the use of colors and the artistic style of the animation in this movie. I also liked the fact that the movie was just the right length, unlike the actual series.

950351,4,6304863535,"You're an 18 year old highschool student who spends most of your day trying to escape 5 ravenous, beautiful, super-women, and one day after escaping these crazy women, a young girl comes up from behind you and says ""Daddy!"" What runs through your mind? Well, I'm 19 and i'd sure as heck be a bit scared, and I believe this movie does quite a job at capturing the shock that one, such as my self, would have in that situation. The movie also does well at developing the favorite characters of the series (Tenchi, Sasami, Ryoko, Ryo-ohki, ect.), but also introduces and develops the new character so good that you quickly fall in love with her.  The movie carries on the traditional slapstick humor and unpredictable events but really does a good job at portraying the emotions in each situation and drawing you into the story.  However, this movie has a disappointing ending, in that it just suddenly happens.  It is also a bit cheesy. I think that if the movie would have been an hour and a half long then a better ending could have been constructed.  It's definitely worth getting though.  It was hilarious to see the whole gang react to the idea that Tenchi has a daughter and watch their suspicious stares at one another and the crazy beat-downs that followed.  I hope to see the cool new character, Mayuka, in upcoming episodes and movies to come.",989971200,2,1351,4.608333333333333
950352,4,6304863535,"""Tenchi Muyo! Manatsu no Eve"" is a movie I truly enjoyed.  I've watched all three ""Tenchi"" series again and again on the Cartoon Network, and have become a Tenchi fanatic.  I can't help myself - the characters are compelling and their relationships complex.  This particular movie seems to follow and combine ""Tenchi Muyo!"" and ""Tenchi Universe"" in that Tenchi is related to the royal family of planet Jurai, with Lighthawk swords and everything.  I don't think this movie, ""Daughter of Darkness,"" is for a general audience, as it immediately assumes that the viewer is familiar with the general Tenchi storylines and characters.
The movie begins with a pleasant summer day, Tenchi and the girls doing their chores around the house and the Masaki shrine.  As Tenchi prepares to come home for lunch, he is confronted by a young girl, Mayuka, who insistently calls Tenchi her ""daddy.""  For all of us who are familiar with Tenchi himself, you know that when something so unusual comes out of nowhere, Tenchi freaks out.  Nothing new here on that tip.  Returning home, of course, Ryoko and Ayeka are beside themselves with jealousy and consternation upon meeting Mayuka.
As it turns out, there is a demon-child named Yuzuha who created Mayuka to exact a centuries-planned revenge plot against Lord Katsuhito/Yosho (Tenchi's grandfather).  Tenchi and his family must figure out what to do with Mayuka and how to defeat the demon Yuzuha.  Oddly enough, since the characters and their milieu is taken largely from the first two television series', the plot of the movie closely mirrors the plot of the third series, ""Tenchi in Tokyo.""  Another odd parallel is that the English voice actor for Mayuka sounds eerily similar to the voice actor who played Sakuya in ""Tokyo.""
The best thing about ""Daughter of Darkness"" for me was the role that Little Washu, my favourite character, plays in the story.  K.T. Vogt, her English voice actor, does a brilliant job, as usual, in making Washu insightful, intelligent, sarcastic, and adorable.  The worst thing about the movie for me was its length.  At only one hour, the movie plays like the last few episodes of a typical series, but without the development of contexts or characters.  Like I said earlier, it assumes you know all the basics.  Also, I don't really understand all the christological referents that surround Mayuka, but I'll leave that to a brighter analyst to parse its significance.
At any rate, ""Daughter of Darkness"" is a fine movie, well-animated (better than the TV shows for my money) and well-acted.  I've already watched it through at least four times, and it really grows on you quickly.  If you love Tenchi, Washu, Mihoshi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Kiyone, Sasami, Katsuhito, Nobuyuki, and Ryo-Ohki already, go and get the movie immediately.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, start with the television series' first.",988934400,3,2877,4.9937106918239
950353,3,6304863535,"A pretty good movie for any hard core Tenchi Muyo! fan, but it really doesn't compare to the television series.  It has it's ups and downs let's just say.  I thought it was unusual that throughout the whole movie they were talking about Christmas, because it was set in the middle of summer!  But I did like that this one hardly had any nudidy in it.  Good fighting scenes, and I think Tenchi was hitting on Ryoko.  3 stars.",988243200,,424,4.3164556962025316

950356,3,6304863535,"I'm 19, and I love the Tenchi series. In my opinion, this is a poorly done Tenchi movie, and by a poorly done Tenchi movie, I mean a very good regular film. The movie is excellent up to a point, with lots of humor and tons of character development, especially with Ryoko (my favorite character). My only real problem with the film is that it gets really cheesy near the end. This isn't really a problem for younger audiences, and it doesn't take away much from the movie; it just makes the movie seem a bit more like a Disney film than I hoped for. In general, the movie doesn't reach the level of the first film, but it's definitely worth buying for Tenchi fans and lovers of the holidays.",974160000,3,690,4.315384615384615

When he comes home with this girl, Ayeka and Ryoko are mad, because they think she is his girlfriend. They argue alot of times with her, and later find out she has extremely powerful powers.

The story is that one day a young girl with blue hair shows up and starts calling Tenchi ""daddy"".Ayeka and Ryoko are both shocked by this and Ryoko trys to kill her. The animation is brillant all the way through. The story has much more action than the first movie and is in my opinion better because of this. I can't wait to see Tenchi Forever!

I thought it was a good story line that Tenchi's ""daughter of darkness"" Mayuka was created from the Demon Yuzuha's and Tenchi's hair.  It's kinda sad too.  I strongly reccomend this title to people 13 and older for a scene of complete nudity, breif language and a scene of sex. (Even thought pioneer ranked it with the 16 and up crowd.  I find that an inappropriate rating!)",999302400,,485,4.465909090909091
7880924,4,6304863535,"I really am an avid fan of Tenchi Muyo! and the other series. It's just that there's one minor factor in the series that gives me the creeps and it bugs me... alot.
The movie starts off on Christmas Eve and there's a demon named Yuzuha. She's been holding this grudge forever against Yosho, Tenchi's grandfather. Seeking revenge, Yuzuha steals a bit of Tenchi's hair and mixes her cells with his hair in a cauldron. A girl by the name of Mayuka pops out. Fast forward to the summer. Everyone is enjoying the lazy days. Mayuka appears and starts calling Tenchi ""daddy."" The girls are wondering if they are the mother of Mayuka. Ryoko and Aeka are not jealous of each other, but the fact that Mayuka is trying to spend a lot of time with Tenchi.
This is the creepy part. For all of you who have watched Shin Tenchi Muyo! or Tenchi in Tokyo, know who the voice of Sakuya Kumashiro is? Yep, that's the same voice of Mayuka. Eww... I have to be astonished that the people that casted the voices would use the same voice. The reason, also, that I gave this movie 4 stars is because the character Mayuka. To complete her mission of bringing Tenchi to Yuzuha's world of darkness, she does these really weird things. One includes kissing him, another, licking Tenchi while he is asleep. Weird. The movie gets a little intense and I just don't understand it.
Still, Manatsu no Eve is a good movie to watch. I really love the music at the ending credits too.",997920000,,1447,4.443609022556391
7880925,5,6304863535,"At first the movie didn't look too promising, mostly because of its length. I didn't see how it was possible that a movie could be crammed into a 60-minute time slot- but 'Daughter of Darkness (Manatsu no Eve)' proved me wrong! I'm sure that you've all heard the general synopsis by now, so I won't bore you with another. Instead, I'll just tell you the terrific points, which was almost everything.
First, the music was absolutely beautiful - not as lovely as that from 'Tenchi Forever (Tenchi Muyo in Love 2)', but as good, if not better, than that from 'Tenchi Muyo in Love'. Second, Mayuka's (Tenchi's 'daughter's') personality was well-developed, and I soon found myself falling in love with her personality, a clash of Sasami and Mishohi, perhaps. She fit right in with Tenchi-tachi. Also, the bonding between characters was absolutely beautiful. Whether it be Ryouko and Aeka's heartwarming talk by Funaho, Tenchi and Ryouko's touching scene on the rooftop, or Sasami and Mayuka's bonding scenes, they all showed character development and such.
Finally, if you are a fan of Tenchi/Ryouko, this is the movie for you. As mentioned before, Tenchi and Ryouko have quite a few touching scenes, the rooftop scene in particular. Also shown is how deeply Ryouko's love for Tenchi runs. We also get to see the more emotional side of Ryouko-san.
There were a couple things that weren't all that great, or just didn't fit. One was why Mayuka had to lick/kiss Tenchi to bring her to Yazuha's domain. Also, I don't quite see why Yazuha went after Tenchi as opposed to who should have been her target- Yoshou, Tenchi's granfather. Also, if the movie were even a mere half-hour longer, the ending would have been better than it already was. However, none of these things made the movie worthy of less than 5 stars.
I have seen all three Tenchi movies and, in my opinion, this was above and beyond the other two. However, I DO NOT recommend this to anyone who hasn't already seen the Tenchi series. The movie starts assuming you know all about the characters, and I'm sorry to say, you'll be lost if you don't have at least some background information on Tenchi-tachi. Also, the movie deserves the PG-13 suggested rating Amazon.com gives it. Overall, this is a terrific movie, one that a diehard Tenchi fan won't want to miss- and the perfect addition to any Tenchi collection!",996364800,2,2368,4.806372549019608
7880926,5,6304863535,"This movie is just like any fun loving Tenchi episode. It starts out when a mysterious girl shows up out of the blue and calls Tenchi her daddy. Of course Ryoko and Ayeka flip out over this newcomer.  This leads to some comical and violent outbreaks.  Of course there is a lot more to it then that, but you can find the rest out for yourself. Its worth buying. :)",994723200,,363,4.171428571428572
