8088777,1,B000BM7Z0A,"I think it was a good idea to put together some of the highlights from the original DVDs of these players. This could have been great. However, they did a really poor job putting these together and they were very cheap about it --the instructional part of the video is just over 25 minutes of content. That sucks! Most of the original videos are at least 45 minutes. They could have expanded this quite a bit more and made it worth buying.

The actual content is good, though I think that Brian Setzer's segment should not have been in this ""Jazz Guitar"" DVD, but rather in a blues/rock DVD. He was definitely out of place after Joe Diorio and Emily Remler. Regardless of the content, this DVD is just a sampler and should be about 5-10 bucks max, or free to help sell all the original content --most of which I own/have seen and it is very good. That they want to charge as much as a full length DVD makes this a total rip off.",1167436800,4,928,4.2727272727272725
8088778,1,B000BM7Z0A,This video producer thought they could squeeze musicians by slapping together parts of other videos. Steer clear this series is pure trash.,1144022400,5,139,5.363636363636363
