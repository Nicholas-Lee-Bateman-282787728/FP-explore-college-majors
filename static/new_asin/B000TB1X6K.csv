I imagined the filmmakers being a couple of tourists traveling through the country with a small camera, spontaneously filming whatever they came across and then packaging it as a ""documentary.""

The last straw for me was a scene filmed at Kovalam Beach in Kerala of several local fisherman are pulling a giant fishing net out of the water. I actually spent a few days at that same beach in 2007. I watched that same group of fisherman bring in that net. What does this have to do with yoga? Absolutely nothing. It's just what the filmmakers happened to see while spending time in a touristy part of the country.",1249948800,8,784,4.681159420289855
8208529,1,B000TB1X6K,"This DVD was a big disappointment.  Shock value in the footage and a weak storyline for one of the world's richest traditions.  I also bought 'Origins of Yoga' at the same time and have enjoyed it very much, as it is a fine general representation of the tradition, and presents many authentic Indian yogis living today.",1238889600,6,319,4.678571428571429
8208530,5,B000TB1X6K,"This movie is about India, it is far from the normal genre of movies about Yoga and India.  This movie has little dialog and lots of scenes that really make you think and go inside.  Its absoluetly not for the squemish as it shows a cremation from start to finish and numerous dead bodies (Agora's)  It is a very deep movie and makes one think about our own mortality.  It shows Inda as it actually is, and not the spiced up version, only showing the ""pretty places"".  I would not show this movie to young childern without watching it first and making a decision about how you want to explain it to them.  Overall, I am still thinking about various points and will take me a long time to digest the immense amount of material in this movie.  A must for people that are serious about yoga and enlightenment.",1198627200,19,806,4.369127516778524
