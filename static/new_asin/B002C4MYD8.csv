From the series The Language of Life, comes this exquisite piece with Arab American poet, Naomi Shihab Nye, reading her poetry and chatting with Moyers about her family's Palestinian past and her American present. A recent Guggenheim fellow, and Poet Laureate of Texas, Naomi's works are found throughout this catalogue - Habibi featured on cover. Her poetry will find resonance with your students, as she gives voice to the joy and beauty in the everyday we take for granted. These are eye- and heart-opening experiences! Also included in this interview and reading is the African American poet Sekou Sundiata. Both artists seek to celebrate, in language, the cultures of today and the way those cultures have become part of the American mosaic.
