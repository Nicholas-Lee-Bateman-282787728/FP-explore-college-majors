5663392,5,B00BPDKXQ2,"You have to be ready to trust in someone other than yourself and Tracy worked for me! I am a half marathon runner and I just couldn't tone my body or lose the last 15 pounds/tummy roll I was carrying around.  After just one week with this DVD and diet, I lost 7 pounds, my clothes fit better and I am on my way to shaping up all over.  TIP: I started this plan the one week of the month that I tend to gain a pound or so and eat everything in sight.  I think this strategy really kickstarted the whole process.  Good luck!  I am even starting to enjoy most of the recipes too!",1379635200,12,576,3.9310344827586206
5663393,5,B00BPDKXQ2,"If you stick to her program, you will have a cute sculpted body!  I lost mine in a move, so I had to re order",1378512000,6,109,3.36
5663394,4,B00BPDKXQ2,"I am new to Tracey anderson DVD's and I have an apple shape. So i got this set and thought would give it a try, after all Tracy looks good. I have to say that I felt the abs all day after the workout and they still feel sore. I am going to stick with this and I hope it works. Although the diet is a little too strict for me. I will continue to eat my regular diet just clean it up a bit.",1378425600,7,388,3.5764705882352943
5663395,4,B00BPDKXQ2,Start out slow if you haven't exercised in a long time. Daily CD exercise plan. It moves! High maintance but fun.,1376956800,4,113,4.428571428571429
5663396,5,B00BPDKXQ2,"At 53, I had been using Tracy's Mat Workout DVD since 2009 along with my elliptical workouts.  I had definitely plateaued (and aged a little), though that DVD had gotten me great results.
Noting my ""muffin top"" tendency and having various ""repetitive motion"" aches & pains, decided to spend the $ and try this.
LOVE, LOVE!  The dance cardio is great - but I can't do like I did in the 80s - knee issues & I'm not 28 anymore - so do occasionally along with elliptical .
Love that the ""transformation"" mat workout changes every 10 days. Hardly any aches - and I'm looking more defined.
I did not need to lose more than 10 lbs, so I did not follow the food plan, just modified my intake somewhat.
Also, since I have knee issues & most of her leg/butt work is executed kneeling, I borrowed her method from the Mat Workout DVD of standing  behind a chair & execute the moves as best I can .  I still see great results doing this.
I'd love to do it the recommended six days a week, but usually end up doing 4 or 5.
So all in all, you don't need to PERFECTLY execute everything to see results, but obviously the more you can the better!",1372809600,39,1129,4.212962962962963

8572171,5,B00BPDKXQ2,"Really transformed my body. Works better than any other workout routine. I saw definition and muscles that I had never seen before on MY body.  I started to see results after 2 weeks.  You just have to hang in there.  The first two times I did it, I didn't know if I could do it.  It's intense but worth it.",1434758400,,307,4.066666666666666
8572172,1,B00BPDKXQ2,"Horrible customer service at the Tracy Anderson website.  She gets lazier and lazier making the workouts as she makes more.  She does something on one side and forgets to do it on the other, she offers lots of instructions on the beginning and then never talks again, the camera focuses on weird angles like her foot so you can't see what she is doing, she moves around into this sort of blurred white zone where you can't see what she is doing, sometimes the workout is incomplete (i.e. arms and abs but no legs), you can tell when they just dubbed together some random workouts to make it look like one continuous one, they also sometimes just flip the image around on the screen so it looks like the other side (right versus left), and she jumps from one sequence to the next leaving you no time to move with her.  Overall, they figured out a way to sell ""variety"" without actually making any variety.",1424044800,,904,4.466666666666667
8572173,1,B00BPDKXQ2,This may be a good workout but I never made it through because she is talking to you but not from what you see on the video.  She is doing the movements without her lips moving and then her voice is dubbed over.  NOT at all motivational.,1423008000,,237,4.0212765957446805
8572174,5,B00BPDKXQ2,A bit boring in the beginning only because it is necessary to really get the movements right because they progressively get faster and more complex. It does not work well if your form is bad so get it right even if boring because it is fun afterwards. The music though could be better but it's kind of hypnotic and gets you in the zone. You can always turn it off and keep voice or lose both. THIS WORKS!!!!,1411776000,,407,4.230769230769231
8572175,4,B00BPDKXQ2,I gave it 4 stars because the exercises are good but the video was a little boring and if you have knee problems there is a part in the video in which you are are your knees for quite a few exercises.,1407974400,,200,3.7857142857142856
8572176,5,B00BPDKXQ2,"Hi everyone,
i am a former skier and have always been very sportive- but with doing sports 3-5 times a week, diets and tears i always was stuck to my 58-62kg  (I am 1.58m small :))..
Her Transformation- Workout is great, the diet is ok (I am hardly ever hungry- you can eat 6-7 times a day in the body-restart-weeks), I just don't like the Cardio- Workout with all the jumping, it just doesn`t work with my injured knees. Instead I use to do poledancing and swimming and hiking, but not every day (3-4 times a week).
I am in week 3 now and the toughest one was the first one.. I didn`t know if I could get through it but then it really got easier.
I startet at a weight of 56.6 kg and know (after 16 days) have 53.5kg.. and I feel great!!
Thumbs up for Tracy! Best workout i have ever tried (although some exercises seem weird at first).
Nothing for non-sportive, lazy girls.
:)",1401235200,2,878,4.226190476190476
8572177,1,B00BPDKXQ2,"Be warned:  I thought this would help me strengthen my core.  By week 2, I hurt my lower back so badly that I could barely move.  I am now in physical therapy.  I am a runner and had no trouble keeping up with the video and have no previous troubles with my back.  With the minimal instructions, it is easy to execute the exercises with incorrect form leading to injury.",1398384000,4,370,4.228571428571429
8572178,3,B00BPDKXQ2,"Having followed Tracy's Mat and Precision Toning DVDs, I had high expectations.  These workouts brought the results that were promised.  I was led to believe that Metamorphosis would build on said results.  The emphasis of weeks 0-5 seemed to be on weight loss at the expense of losing muscle mass.  The ""smaller, accessory"" muscles that I was so proud of diminished quickly and that ""pulled in tight"" feeling that I enjoyed was gone with them.  I'll stick with weeks 7-9 but it doesn't help that she announces midway through the 9 week program that Metamorphosis is just the beginning and you'll have to order follow up DVDs through her website to continue to see results.  I feel like a chump for falling for a money making scheme.  I knew the plastic tape measure and diet pamphlets were cheap marketing gimmicks, but I was so pleased with her single DVDs, that I made the purchase against my better judgment.  To add to this insult as a consumer, I get the sense that these recordings are done on the cheap and sold with maximum profit in mind.",1396828800,14,1048,4.627027027027027
8572179,4,B00BPDKXQ2,"First, here's some about me before I give you my honest opinion.  I can easily gain and loose weight, I used to play volleyball and did intense conditioning during that time. I am 5'11"" weigh anywhere between 135-145 pounds.  I don't need to loose weight and I will say honestly that that is not my goal.  I found these dvd's in my mom's junk, never opened so I thought I'd try.

Cardio/Dance:

Now a lot of people say that this isn't dance, and it isn't (to an extent).  I didn't follow her every move and I don't feel like I need to with these videos.  A lot of her moves remind me of my conditioning classes I took with extra arm movements.  I believe her goal is to keep you moving and jumping.  I found myself smiling while doing this, because I know I look like an idiot.  Overall, it wasn't bad but I understand why dancers don't like it.

The workout DVD was hard for me.  Only because I'm used to doing just sit ups, pushups and running.  The leg movements were hard, but I really enjoyed them and I'm excited to continue.  I was definately working up a sweat.  I'd also like to note that I think if you have not had previous athletic training that this is going to be hard and you could hurt yourself.

Now the diet plan is kind of weird for me.  I'm currently doing the cleanse week, and I will try to stay by her recipes.  But I have been adjusting them a lot and it takes a lot of time to prepare.  In the future weeks I will allow myself to eat more than what she has planned and I will probably throw in my own recipes.

Overall, I will love it if I see results and tone my body to where I want it.  I do think her meal plan is too much for me but I'm going to use it as my base to build off of.  I hope I can keep it up...",1392768000,5,1738,3.9768115942028985
