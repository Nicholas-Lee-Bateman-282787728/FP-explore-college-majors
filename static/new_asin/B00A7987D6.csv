The explanations of what is going on is told by the equipment in the shots. It's educational and entertaining. We are looking to acquire the entire series. Keep an eye out for the Mega Packs, though. They're the best value by far.",1378166400,,387,4.243243243243243

5392008,5,B00A7987D6,"He watches them over and over and over and knows which show is on which disc; he's 3 and can't read yet, but man, does he ever have a steel trap mind when it comes to machinery and equipment.  He loved these.  One (not sure which, as I bought 3) has the machines 'going to school' and learning to dig. He really loved that; he's in 'school' himself (day care) and he was loving it that diggers also had to go to school.  He kept saying ""Look, Mommie!  They're going to school!!""",1374451200,7,478,4.163043478260869

5392010,5,B00A7987D6,My 4 year old son loves these movies! He is obsessed with trains and heavy equipment and this is such a wonderful way for him to learn about them. I love the fact that these are so educational and it makes me feel better knowing his tv viewing time is spent watching this and not something else less informative. It's also nice that there are separate discs so you can keep them in several places and not have to search for specific topics.,1371513600,,440,4.313253012048193

5392028,3,B00A7987D6,I prefer John Deere action dvds. Mighty Machines has people talking in different voices pretending like the machines are talking to one another. I'd prefer if it just had a regular narrator explaining the machines and what they are doing. My boys 3 & 5 like them enough but they request John Deere action more often.,1449100800,,316,4.660714285714286

It's a nice change from today's highly stimulating cartoons.",1424649600,,384,4.5
5392048,5,B00A7987D6,"If your child loves tractors and trucks, then he will loved this set.  I got this for my almost 3 year old son for Christmas and he loves watching these videos.

5392060,5,B00A7987D6,"My son, now almost 4, has loved this since he was 1.5 years old.  It is guilt-free child's TV for me, because it feels more like an educational documentary than cartoon garbage or fluff.  I myself have learned a bit from the shows. I think it's a good idea to start kids out with something slower-paced and deliberate like this. This is a good set, the ""On the job"" DVD is his current favorite and when he was younger he loved On the railways (trains) and Under water (the submarine one).",1420156800,,488,4.351648351648351
