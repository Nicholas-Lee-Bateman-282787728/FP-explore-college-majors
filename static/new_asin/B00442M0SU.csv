8415614,3,B00442M0SU,"There is synergy here between the conductor and pianist.  There is a special connection that is obvious.
The PQ and SQ are great.
My quibble here is that we know we are making a blu-ray disc of this concert, right?  And we are wearing all black, conductor.  Couldn't you, or some friend give you a brush off before you come on stage??????",1495065600,,338,4.419354838709677

8415616,5,B00442M0SU,"Vladimir Jurowski a young conductor, brilliantly directs the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. His fast tempi are right for the pieces he conducts with passion. Metamorphosen for twenty-three strings,was written in Nazi Germany in the closing months of the war. Indeed,at the conclusion of the manuscript, Strauss wrote ""In Memoriam""-in memory of the Germany then being occupied by the Allied forces. Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme op 60,was written as a thank you offering to Max Reinhardt, who had transformed the Dresden production of Der Rosenkavlier. Hofmannsthal, Strauss' Librettist had adopted Moliere's play Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, with incidental dances and there was also to be a 30 minute opera Ariadne auf Naxos. This version was performed in Stuttgart 1912. It was a failure. Some of the incidental music was taken from the play and used in the new opera Adriane auf Naxos first performed in 1916. The piece conducted by Jurowski,emphasizes the gentle themes. See if you can pick the music from Le Bourgeois, Strauss used in his opera to be.

Helene Grimaud and Vladimir Jurowski are a dream team, both young. The Ravel Concerto in G, first and third movements are influenced by the jazz influences of Gershwin,whose rhythms she handles well. However, it is the Adagio Assai, the second movement,where she shows her skills. The opening part is played without the backing of the orchestra,is melting beautiful. So much in fact, one of the young woman violinists in the orchestra sways to her playing. The camera captures another young orchestra member amazed at what she is hearing. I played this piece over and over again. How can one place it into words, they are so meaningless and shallow. You must experience it. Beauty is but a frail flower, lingering only briefly,then is no more. For in the now is eternity. In memory of my dear departed Paula, a concert pianist,who died so tragically young. My daughter is named after her. Such is the power of music. This divine movement. May you enjoy this sublime Bluray as I have.",1313280000,6,2031,5.026706231454006
8415617,5,B00442M0SU,"What a wonderful musical experience! The works of R. Strauss and Ravel played here may not be very popular but you will be mesmerized by their beauty, depth, and ""freshness"". All are excellent but my favorite is Ravel's piano concerto in G. Especially, 2nd movement brings such peace and gentle joy. The rendition of the pianist is precise and musical. The young conductor Vladimir Jurowski seems to be very good at expressing subtle nuance and inner detail of each work. Technically, both video and audio quality is at top notch. Very highly recommended!",1307923200,3,555,4.978494623655914
