8579762,3,B00CBDG4WM,"Pride of the Bowery, 1940 film

The movie starts with a view of lower Manhattan. [Anyone recognize the neighborhood?] A sign says ""Vassey Street Boys Club"". Muggs wants to train as a fighter for a Golden Gloves bout. They join the Civilian Conservation Corps. A truck takes them into the country. Muggs learns the rules. They get $22 a month for support of their families. [Work relief?] First they get their physical examination. ""Report to the Captain!"" He explains the rules. The bell announces dinner, a whistle tells when to start. A pillow fight at night. Allen doesn't squeal. Road work in the morning. The doctor orders exercise. The forestry crew is cutting down big trees. Muggs rescues Allen. The Captain praises Muggs. There will be boxing bouts in town. One boy's brother is in a jam, he needs a lot of money in a hurry. Muggs will help. The boxing begins. [Are they evenly matched?]

One boy slips away from the fight to burglarize an office. The Captain declares a draw. The crowd boos the result. Muggs is shunned. Muggs meets a young woman and boasts. They walk around the camp. Muggs talks to the Captain and asks for leave on Saturday. Muggs buys flowers, then walks around town. He meets Willy, who confesses his theft. ""You gotta help me."" Muggs wants his money in advance. He goes the six rounds. Is Willie a sneaky manipulator? [A lesson here.] The Captain catches him! ""What will he do?"" ""I'm awfully sorry."" Elaine talks to him, the Captain suspects there is more to the story. Danny tells his suspicions to the Captain. There is a chase by the lake, and a confession. Can things be corrected? Muggs has fire in his belly now, even better than before. A distraction causes a problem. The lesson is there are times when a man should talk, it is not squealing. ""Here we go again, boys.""

You also need to avoid being fooled by one of your gang through misplaced trust. You have to know your limits. The scenery looks more like the hills of California than upstate New York. That's a long way from the lower East Side. This is a better than average story for this series.",1471219200,,2093,4.590909090909091
