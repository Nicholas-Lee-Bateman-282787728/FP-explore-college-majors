8374485,5,B002N1AF0O,"Got it on time, worth more than what I paid for. I first knew about this Arab Jordanian composer on YouTube. I ordered a used copy not expecting it to be this much interesting. Being able to lead on his piano an orchestra of a hundred musicians, Zade's concert  is a marvelous event that is worth attending in person.",1362441600,,317,4.372881355932203
8374486,5,B002N1AF0O,"He is extremely talented, I already have his albums and it is one of the most soothing music I have heard....

If you are into soft piano concerts this is the one to see and hear...",1359072000,,181,4.027777777777778
8374487,4,B002N1AF0O,"Some wonderful music, very much along the lines of Yanni, with more of a middle-eastern flair. There are many of the same musicians that accompanied Yanni on his Acropolis and Tribute tours, including Pedro Eustache and appearances from Karen Briggs and Charlie Bisharat. My only complaint, especially given that this is the DVD, is that Zade has some extremely awkward facial mannerisms which make him look almost possessed at times. Other than that one complaint, it's some great music from an up and coming composer well worth the purchase.",1302393600,,543,5.112359550561798
8374488,5,B002N1AF0O,"This concert appeared on PBS over a month ago and was nothing less than spectacular. Evidently, Zade does not have a big following in the U.S. This should put him on the global map. Check out the CD too.",1253750400,4,203,4.230769230769231
