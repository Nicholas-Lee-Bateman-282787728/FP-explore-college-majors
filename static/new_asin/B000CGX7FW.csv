2464675,3,B000CGX7FW,"A suspense thriller featuring strangers thrown together in a live or die situation, House of 9 (2005) is a semi-interesting watch, that proceeds to an expected conclusion.  The film features some stylishly executed violence, and the acting has some energy, however there are some significant problems with character behavior that isn't very believable.

Nine people, apparently in the London vicinity, are abducted and taken to an unknown location.  It looks like the interior of a house, with bedrooms, corridors, and stairs to a lower level.  The only way out appears to be through a set of large double doors, which are locked.  Any other openings are sealed up.  Trapped inside, the group hears a man's voice coming from a speaker on the wall.  Their captor informs them that they are part of an experiment for his entertainment, and that only one person will walk out alive, and in return will receive five million dollars.  Cameras and microphones planted around the place, and he will be watching.

Except for Francis (Hippolyte Girardot) and Cynthia (Julienne Davis), who are married, none of the people know each other.  The group includes Father Duffy (Dennis Hopper) a priest, policeman Jay (Raffaello Degruttoia), Lea (Kelly Brook) a dancer, Claire (Susie Amy) a pro tennis player, parolee Shona (Morven Christie), Max (Peter Capaldi) who designs clothes, and rapper Al B (Asher D).  Some food is provided, alcohol is available, and for some reason, Jay has a handgun, which makes him the de facto leader.  Rather than acting rationally, the group is prone to emotional outbursts and arguing, with certain members expressing open hostility.  Much like immature school kids, they fight over food, rooming arrangements, booze, and what to do.

Things settle down, after the group fails in an attempt to break out of the space.  With escape apparently impossible, friction starts to build between certain members, eventually leading to violence and then an unexpected fatality.  From there, the willingness to kill seems to grow, as violence explodes suddenly, resulting in growing suspicion among the survivors.  Trust is in short supply, as one player makes a very determined effort to win the game.  Eventually one is left, the locked door opens, and the prize is claimed.

With the goal of having the characters kill each other off, the directions the plot can take are limited, given that there is little real stimulus to drive them to kill.  What the writers come up with are overdramatic conflicts, dumb conversations, and characters behaving rudely and irrationally, constantly insulting each other.  The fighting for silly reasons, gets old fast.

There are some good moments, as the cast tries to work with what they are given, but the constant bickering and bad dialog drags things down.  Dennis Hopper lays it on thick playing a peace-loving man of God, who then picks up the gun, but the over the top acting award goes to Hippolyte Girardot, who as Francis, gets into the spirit of the game early, and plays it hard with calculating cunning.  As the sensible god-fearing one, Lea manages to avoid conflicts with the other females.

House of 9 isn't a disaster, but it isn't great either.  Production values are good, and the action sequences and kills are well done, though with a bit too much quick cutting.  The characters are not believable, but the animated performances generally hold your interest, and when it comes to the killing, nearly everyone gets a chance to play.  If you are into the survival of the fittest scenario, the film is probably worth a look.  The widescreen presentation is not subtitled, and there are no extras on the DVD besides a trailer.",1311033600,,3690,5.013136288998358
2464676,5,B000CGX7FW,"I ignored this movie for a very long while until I finally made a mistake and clicked on it.

this was definitely a hidden gem in terms of a great horror and suspense. The only cast I was familiar with was Dennis Hopper and I never had that much like in his acting as a sane character, but he really took this role with greatness. I was happy about this movie as a whole (despite the crazy finish). Highly recommend for thriller nuts!",1300406400,,434,4.228915662650603
2464677,5,B000CGX7FW,"Speaking as a Kelly Brook fan and not as a movie critic I'm going to say thumbs down to this one.

Okay. I have to admit I was expecting/hoping to see Kelly in some sexy clothes and maybe a bikini or even a nude scene. There was none of the above.

This movie has a very thin plot.  A bunch of people get locked into a house and resort to killing each other. There is a lot of ""B movie"" grade acting but I will admit I liked the surprise ending! Just when you think you know how it's going to end...Bam! You will get blindsided by the unexpected finish!

If you like B movie thrillers with at least one pretty girl then you should add this movie to your collection.

If you are fan of Kelly Brook you should check out Survival Island.

2464678,2,B000CGX7FW,"I would like to say: I have read some very good books over the years and they were written with Plot and Ploy. This movie was low budget and it lacked meaning to me. The characters didn't have any structure at all, they were just there. I did not find this movie interesting at all I only watched it so that I could get the Soundtrack info. Now that I did like.
One more thing, If I'm not mistaken, the scene with the rapper (who's Black) and the Cop (who's a policeman) gives off the impression that young
black men are hostile to the police. why else would this twisted director
put that scene in the movie? One thing I've learned in this life, is that
there are some very sick people in this world.... Just look at the director of this movie...Think about it!!",1216598400,,763,4.268965517241379
2464679,3,B000CGX7FW,"TAKE 9 PEOPLE STICK THEM IN A HOUSE WHICH YOU CAN'T GET OUT AND OFFER ONE OF THEM 5 MILLION DOLLARS TO KILL ALL THE OTHERS. EACH ONE HAS A CHOICE PLAY THE GAME OR DIE. PLAY IN THE CABIN FEVER ROLE AND WATCH EACH ONE SLOWLY START TO UNRAVEL. THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PICTURE TO WATCH. ADD THE MOVIE CUBE AND SAW 2 AND YOU HAVE HOUSE OF 9.

THIS IS A STUDY ON THE INSANITY PEOPLE BECOME IN TRYING TO SURVIVE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOCK UP 9 STRANGERS ALL WITH STRONG AND DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES. ONE PRIEST, ONE COP, ONE BLACK RAPPER, A DRUGGIE, A FASHION DESIGNER, A MODEL, A HUSBAND AND WIFE, AND A DANCER ARE PLACED TOGETHER TO PLAY A GAME. ATTITUDES AND PERSONAL BELIEFS SUCH AS FAITH, RACISM, BEING RICH AND BEING POOR ALL PLAY A FACTOR.

THIS FILM GOES ALONG WITH THE IDEA OF BEING LOCKED UP AND PUSHING ONESELF TO ULTIMATE STRUGGLE IN TRYING TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE. TENSIONS BOIL OVER AS EACH PERSON HAS A VIEWPOINT OR ONCE SOME TYPE OF LEADER ROLE. ADD IN THE BASIC BAD BLACK GUY WHO ARE ALWAYS TYPED CAST AS THE LOUD MOUTH THINKING EVERYTHING IS RACIST AND HATES COPS I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THAT IS IT JUST TURNS YOU OFF FROM THAT ROLE. THIS ORDEAL WITH THE COP AND THE RAPPER BOILS OVER THROUGHOUT THE SHOW UNTIL THE FINAL SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THEM TWO.

I ONLY REALLY LIKED ONE PERSON IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE AND THAT WAS LEA ALL THE OTHERS WHERE STUCK UP, OBNOXIOUS PEOPLE THAT IF THEY DIED IT WOULD BE DOING THE WORLD A FAVOR, HELL FOR 5 MILLION DOLLARS AND NO ONE KNOWS I DID IT BRING ON THAT HOUSE CAUSE I HATE EVERYONE OF THEM IN THIS MOVIE ACCEPT LEA. I DO THINK THAT IS WHAT THE WRITER WAS GOING FOR IN MAKING YOU HATE EACH ONE IN SOME WAY.

THE ACTING IS WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE STAND OUT. IT IS BELIEVABLE AND REALITY BASED AS EACH ONE TENDS TO GO INSANE OR TRIES TO SURVEY THE ORDEAL YOU START TO FEEL THAT YOU ARE THERE WITH THEM IN THAT HOUSE. I REALLY LIKE THE CLOSED IN CLAUSTROPHOBIC FEEL THAT GAVE IT A NICE HORROR TOUCH AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AWAY OR TO RUN ANYWHERE FOR SAFETY AS THE POOP STARTS TO HIT THE FAN.

FOR AN INTERESTING INSANITY TYPE FILM WITH GREAT ACTING AND A BASIC UNORIGINAL PLOT THIS MOVIE WORKS. IT'S NOTHING GREAT BUT DOES DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO IN MY BOOK ANYWAYS.",1216598400,,2206,4.097222222222222
2464680,3,B000CGX7FW,"This remake of the classic TEN LITTLE INDIANS by Agatha Christie is not as good as expected.  The acting is regular not very convincing at times.  9 people are kidnapped and put into house with all doors locked and windows blocked.  The game is that they are supposed to spend the night and make it to be the only one alive by the morning in order to win 5 million dollars.  The plot even though was known by many is not well exploited or adapted.  The movie is very slow and kind of boring at times.  However there are good moments and the ending was totally unexpected.  For that reason I gave 3 stars.  Rent it, don't buy it... if you buy it, you won't know what to do with the DVD once you have seen it.

2464701,2,B000CGX7FW,"A brilliant premise. Recreate reality tv in a movie. Yay!

A bunch of people are kidnapped, locked up in a house, and left to their own devices. The one who is still alive at the end wins the prize money. Yes, it's like Saw 2, but without the sadistic violence. It plays out like most reality shows. The participants party, get drunk, throw up, argue, and fight. It's about as boring as reality tv too, but at least here the participants die and don't just get voted out.

Dennis Hopper feels misplaced as an irish priest, but he does add some weight and depth to the film. Without him, this would not be worth watching.",1198972800,2,620,4.3826086956521735

2464703,4,B000CGX7FW,"One could be excused for thinking this sounds overly familiar.  Nine strangers find themselves trapped together inside a manor, where the voice of the unknown mastermind who's gathered them there soon addresses them over the intercom system.  Definately shades of both ""Saw"" and ""Cube"" already, and, apparantly, of a movie called ""My Little Eye"" as well (which I'm not familiar with) according to a blurb on the DVD case.

  Early attempts to break out of the house prove it's pretty well impossible to bust through the reinforced walls and shuttered windows, and then the mastermind on the intercom lays out the rules of the 'game' that's being recorded.  Nine people in.  Last one alive is the only one to leave, and leaves with a five million dollar prize.  Naturally, no one is thrilled at the concept layed out before them.

  From there, the way events unfold is in the hands of the 'players'; their abductor doesn't attempt to communicate further, although a strange device does provide food for the players, and the mastermind is apparantly still deciding what and when.  To encourage the group to enter tense situations and make the game interesting, the mastermind has chosen the participants well.  A couple of socially maladjusted, hostile individuals are in the mix to ensure that the group won't be able to smoothly function as a group toward a single goal (like getting free without killing each other) while a cop in the mix is the only one with a gun, sowing seeds of suspicion.  Dennis Hopper, in an interesting change of pace for the actor renowned for some very villainous roles, plays an Irish priest attempting to use reason and faith to convince the other members to resist playing into their captor's hands, and to resist the urge to mistrust and turn on one another.  Well acted, well written, and skillfully directed, with attention to detail and several surprise twists,  ""House Of 9"" distinguishes itself from other gems like Saw and Cube and emerges as a distinct, and great, movie of its own.  And one very much worth getting.",1190678400,,2056,4.862068965517241
2464704,2,B000CGX7FW,"I don't actually have a problem with the fact that the plot is similar to the Saw and Cube franchises. Some people might call it a ripoff or whatever, but that's not a factor for me (I didn't make those other movies, so why should it matter?).

After just a couple minutes into the movie, the number one thing that jumped out at me was the atrocious, and unrealistic dialogue. Those kinds of things actually bother me the most about movies, when characters are making decisions or saying things that are just not consistent with what's provided in their environment.

Right off the bat, every character is antagonistic towards each other, to a clichd and unrealistic level. I mean come on, if you wake up in a strange house and are trapped with strangers, bickering with them is not your first priority (and I don't even mean they *started to bicker later on regarding a plan of action or something, I mean literally the bickering began right away, even *before looking for a way out, which should be your number one priority).

When they first hear the voice on the loudspeaker telling them they were trapped, what the objective was, etc., even THEN the characters are bickering about what the message could mean, how they should act, etc. This so absolutely unrealistic. I think the writers are mistaking fear, panic, and confusion that may cause people to snap at each other, with pure HATRED. Not realistic at all, no reason whatsoever these characters would have such deep resentment towards each other, unless you're gonna use the excuse that they all somehow blamed each other for their ordeal.

No need for me to get into the acting, it speaks for itself and mocks itself more than I ever could.",1186444800,,1703,4.704697986577181
2464705,3,B000CGX7FW,"It was an okay movie for a horror; however, the plot is very similar to SAW 1-3, and I did not find this very amusing. If you have nothing better to do then this movies is for you, I would not recommend it to anyone.",1182816000,3,216,3.8222222222222224
2464706,3,B000CGX7FW,"House of 9 offers very little but a slightly new twist on an archetypal horror motif and some pretty incomprehensible casting.  Dennis Hopper as a priest?  I mean, come on, a priest?  Hopper?  Casting really dropped the ball all the way around on this one, I'm afraid.  Hopper is probably the best actor of the whole bunch.  They should have called this movie House of 9 Bad Actors, or House of 9 Characters You Desperately Want to See Die.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you actually have to slog through the entire first half of the movie to get to the first of the characters' eagerly-anticipated deaths.  The first forty five minutes is basically these nine people moaning about their fate and verbally attacking one another.

So here's the premise.  Nine individuals are randomly chosen to partake in a little contest, and by chosen I mean kidnapped, drugged, and deposited within the confines of a mysterious house.  Once they all awaken and gather together, they learn that one of them will win five million dollars.  There will be no consolation prizes for the losers, however, as they will all be dead.  You see, in order to win, you have to outlive the other eight people in the house.  So who are these lucky people chosen to take part in this deadly little game?  Well, you have a priest (Hopper), a dancer, a criminal, a pro tennis player, a fashion designer, a cop, a composer and his wife, and a would-be rapper, each and every one a total stereotype, especially the rude, vulgar, selfish, cop-hating rapper (honestly, I'm surprised someone in the black community hasn't protested this film's racist characterization of the offensive rapper).

Once they're satisfied that there is no way out of this place, the group comes together and sort of decides not to play the madman's game, as he obviously wants them to turn on and kill one another.  That spirit of mutual cooperation amongst suffering doesn't last long, of course.  These characters are all so incredibly annoying, there's no way anyone could put up with them for long.  You'll be ready to reach in and strangle every last one of them yourself long before they stop bickering and get down to the business of showing audiences the ugly side of human nature.

Once characters start dying (immediately after taking a quick break from their verbal sparring in order to bump and grind against one another to some really bad rap music), the movie finally finds a little traction in the blood that is spilled.  The second death is a particularly brutal thing to watch.  It's all downhill from that point, though, as the filmmakers dropped whatever pretense of character development there was and just had everyone start killing each other.  It leads up to a fairly decent ending, but there was really no way for the film to recover from its disastrous first half.

Dennis Hopper does provide some unintentional entertainment, though.  He plays what I assume is an Irish priest, but he has a habit of forgetting his fake accent - and when he does actually remember to use it, he sounds more like some Indian chief out of an old western than an Irishman.  I guess I should mention the fact that all of these characters are European, so you've got accents flying all over the place in this one.

Definitely, those entering the House of 9 should beware of stereotypes, clichs, accents, and overused horror motifs.  And don't go expecting a nice nude scene or two to help you over the rough patches, either.  There were only two women in the film I would even want to imagine naked, and neither one comes close to revealing anything at all.  It also bugs me that ""the Watcher"" can afford this big, escape-proof house and five million dollar payouts, but the cameras he has installed in every room are no better than the crappy security cameras you find in banks.  All in all, I think I'm being pretty darn generous in giving this film three stars.",1182297600,11,3922,4.6817518248175185

2464709,4,B000CGX7FW,"House of 9 (Steven R. Monroe, 2004)

Sometimes you go into a movie not expecting much, and you end up wowed by it. House of 9 is the first movie to do that to me this year. I was expecting just another not-very-good entry in the microbudget horror wars; what I ended up with was a fine (though not without flaws) absurdist drama, The Exterminating Angel on crack with gratuitous violence. I'll tell you now, before writing the rest of the review: you want to see this movie.

For reasons of his own-- reasons of which neither the characters in the film, nor we, are ever apprised-- a nameless, unseen, very rich individual (voiced by Ella Enchanted's Jim Carter) abducts nine people and seals them in a mansion. Their mission: to be the only person to leave the house alive. The reward: five million dollars.

While the movie suffers from some average-at-best acting and an overly facile ending you'll see coming a mile off, they're balanced out by a smashing script, brilliant set design, and a willingness to break every rule in the book. House of 9 isn't a horror film. It's not even a survival thriller, at least not for most of its length. The first half of the film is about the characters forming bonds, trying to learn the rules of their environment, and eventually devolving (with outside assistance). Luis Bunuel would probably not jump to anoint Steven Monroe his successor based on this film, but at least he's not spinning in his grave. If you go into this movie without expectations, you'll find yourself with a very pleasant surprise. *** ",1172534400,,1554,4.681318681318682

What starts the mayhem is an altercation between a young man- who begins dancing with a married woman -and her husband. There is some poor acting in this movie in my opinion. And the worst of it belongs to Dennis Hopper- that fake Irish accent just goes in and out- painful. Also if a man kills 2 people and they lock him up like they should, why would they get mad at another guy for killing him? That was really stupid and hard to believe. This guy kills a cop and a guys wife, so the husband understandibly gets mad and kills him, then everyone gets angry with the husband!!??

2464722,3,B000CGX7FW,"There are some really good elements to this movie. Strangers randomly kidnapped and put into a locked home with only one survivor to earn the $5 million prize. Simple enough. There is a fair amount of tension among the protagonists, and the performances are effective enough to be believable. The buildup is slow, pervasive, and really not predictable. There is always a sense that something could happen at any moment, and the movie preys on that atmosphere. And I was suprised by the ending, which revealed a truly creative twist.

Having said that, the most horrifying part of this film is Dennis Hopper's attempt to maintain an Irish accent as the completely out-of-place priest. Just plain bad as his character is oddly juxtaposed against the other youthful cast members. And while there is tension, there is also a considerable amount of brooding, where the characters simply look unhappy, drink, or console each other quietly while overbearing music plays in the background. And for a film that feeds off the intensity of the feelings hopelessness, fear, and isolation, the deaths come suddenly over a brief period and in a rather hurried fashion.

All in all, a good rental that ultimately hit its target despite a few significant stumbles along the way. You'll be forgiven for hitting the fast forward dial a time a two when things get slow.",1162166400,4,1350,4.942731277533039

It's basically about the survival of the fittest because everyone is willing to kill one another for their life and money.

I liked the music in the movie because it is versatile swinging from country to hip hop. And one of the characters even raps in the movie! I think one of my favorite parts though would have to be when everyone in the house found out that they were trapped so there was nothing left to do but party and get drunk!

I thought the character's performances were all really good too, especially Dennis Hopper's. I thought his performance was superb because he really creeped me out. At first he's the quiet innocent priest and then later on in the movie you can't even trust his priesthood because like everyone else, he might be a killer.

Some thrillers leave you discontent after watching the film, but House Of 9 doesn't disappoint. I also was glad to see Dennis Hopper once again, since he's such a great character actor.

I highly recommend this to fans of thriller/suspense movies.  The movie doesn't try to distract you with a lot of blood and gore. They really let the plot speak for itself in order to intrigue the audience.",1141171200,,761,4.507246376811594
2464732,5,B000CGX7FW,"The last reviewer hit it pretty much on the mark.  House of 9 at first seemed like a train wreck between Saw and the Cube movies.  However, the acting (though many of the actors are american and speak in foreign languages) is good enough.  The plot is as simple as can be...9 people locked in a house of some sort and only 1 will get out alive; and although I don't believe this was ever released in theaters, the production value rivals that of Saw and I would say surpasses Cube, so it's not a cheapy movie made with a video camera or anything.  Basically, if you liked Saw and/or Cube and you're not turned away at the thought of a movie that treads awfully familiar turf, you might find yourself locked into this Hitchcockian locked-room mystery/thriller.",1140998400,2,759,4.518248175182482
2464733,2,B000CGX7FW,"Yep, this unusually strange thriller takes elements from CUBE, TEN LITTLE INDIANS and SAW, and adds the reality tv formula for its shocks.  Nine strangers are imprisoned by someone who tells them only one of them will live and they will be five million dollars richer.  But who will kill them?  We have the stock portfolio of participants:  the wisened saintly priest (a subdued but ineffective Dennis Hopper); the nice young dancer; the loud/foul mouthed rap singer; the effeminate fashion designer; the macho self righteous cop; the slutty girl; the addicted girl; and the not so happily married couple.  They're all extremely unlikeable, although the dancer isn't too bad, and the director forces us through two horrible songs, one an insipid powere ballad, the other an insipid rap song, and gives us long shots of the characters just sitting around.  When the killing start, they seem to come from nowhere and I found myself not caring who survived.  The ending is ridiculous:  no true resolution used for a shock effect that is simply dead.  HOUSE OF 9 Could have been a good movie, but it's an empty house by the time it's over.",1140825600,5,1135,4.839378238341969
2464734,5,B000CGX7FW,"This is actually the first horror film I've seen Dennis Hopper in (excuse me if I've forgotten any of his previous works), and I think he actually fits well in this kind of movie. He's always been like a psycho killer in his previous movies, so naturally when saw him in this movie, I was like, he Must be the killer...but yea. I don't wanna ruin too much of the movie.

Anyhow the movie's essentially about 9 strangers who get trapped inside a house and forced to play a twisted game, where one survivor will get to keep his life, along with 5 million dollars. The acting in this movie was superb; I think the cast captures the theme of desperation very well. Character development is superb as well.

Overall a very good horror movie, worth checking out whether or not you're a Dennis Hopper fan or not! =)",1140566400,2,808,4.416107382550336
2464735,5,B000CGX7FW,"This movie is a magnificent mystery horror movie. The starring actor is the legendary Dennis Hopper and directed by Steven R. Monroe. This movie was so well produced and the cast performed extremely well. The plot was magnificent and full of many twists. The story is basically about nine strangers getting locked into a mansion and are forced to kill each other in order to leave. The last survivor is promised 5 million dollars in cash prize and their life back. The story line was great because it gave you the horrific visuals as well as a point unlike many other films where they miss the whole plot. Loved how everyone gets desperate in trying to find a way out creating tension among them all. This just shows us what humans are willing to do in order to survive. Sometimes acting like savages and doing just about anything. This film brings tension and drama that will have you sit on your couch with your nails at the tip of your mouth. Overall I was really surprised on just how well this movie turned out and I would definitely recommend everyone to pick it up. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. Very tense!

What a thriller!",1140480000,,1154,4.495238095238095
2464736,4,B000CGX7FW,"I was pleasantly surprised by House of 9. As the movie begins, I saw the premise unfold and thought... what a great idea... sort of SAW 2 meets BATTLE ROYALE meets SURVIVOR.

Although more of a ripoff of SAW 2 (or maybe SAW 2 was a ripoff of House of 9? Not sure, maybe it was unintentional), HOUSE of 9 approaches the subject with fresh ideas and MORE REALISM. Where Saw 2 struggles to be commercial and come up with BIZARRE and MORE BIZARRE ways to kill people with the funky contraptions and riddles, HOUSE of 9 keeps it real.

As 9 unwitting people are snatched off the streets and wake up in a house that is sealed and unescapable, they are told that one person will be allowed to leave the house, and that person will be given $5 million... that one person is the soul survivor... meaning... the only way out... is for them to kill each other.

Where Saw 2 wastes no time getting into the depravity and murder and the thin assumption that a bunch of criminals will want to murder the son of the man who put them in prison, HOUSE of 9 keeps it real. It explores human nature and the unwillingness to comply and wait it out. How long would it take for a house full of strangers to actually want to kill each other? And how? there is one gun, with few bullets.

The mostly unknown cast, with the exception of Dennis Hopper and Kelly Brook, deliver well. As time goes by, the food is minimal, the personalities are clashing and tensions are building. Violence is coming and you can feel it, despite the members of the house's relucatance to participate in the sick game.

Unfortuntaley, the director relied to heavily on a couple of MTV montage moments that seemed to go on forever, the movie is actually a really good comment on human nature, madness, survival and what happens to a person when they've taken the life of another.

I'll admit... 4 stars... may, just may be a little too strong, and 5 stars is WAY TOO STRONG... but the movie was entertaining and better than most of the little straight to video movies that hit the video store shelves. I never once wished I was watching something else. I wanted to watch it unfold and see what was in store.

Not to mention, the ENDING was FANTASTIC! The ending... the final scene when the winner picks up their money... was the best part of the movie.

Rent it, watch it, I only recommend to buy if you're a big Kelly Brook fan. And who isn't?",1140220800,34,2397,4.370786516853933
2464737,5,B000CGX7FW,"I actually first heard about this movie through a friend and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the legendary actor Dennis Hopper was starring in this movie. I personally think this is one of Hopper's most intriquing works and since it's an indie release it allows him to express himself much more freely. This movie shares similar aspect's to the recently released movie Saw 2, but is filled with even more twists (if you can believe that). It does get quite bloody in bits but overall the gore factor is kept at an appropriate level. Overall I was really surprised on just how well this movie turned out and I would definitely recommend everyone to pick it up if you like slow paced terror. Story is great, cinematography is excellent, and the acting is superb. 5 stars all the way!",1140048000,,789,4.602836879432624
2464738,5,B000CGX7FW,"I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and House of 9 definitely lived up to my expectations of a good horror film. This was one of those movies that had you sitting on the edge of your seating, desperate to see what would happen next.  There were plenty of thrills and twists to keep you watching, something that I love about these kinds of movies. The basic plot is that nine random people get kidnapped and forced into this house together. Basically, they have to kill one another off, and the last person standing will be free as well as getting money for being the lone survivor. It's an interesting view of what people will do for money these days, and that was something I really enjoyed about the movie.

Visually it also captured your attention. It was done well, without too much gore, but more about the plot than savage killings. A great job is done of getting to know the characters, and the acting was really good. Dennis Hopper stars in the movie, and his character was probably my favorite. He showed the struggle between what we believe is right and what we, as human beings, are willing to do to get what we want.

I would definitely suggest this film to any horror film fan that I know. It was worth my time to watch it and will most likely go on my shelf with the rest of my favorite horror films. Give it a watch, you won't regret it.",1139529600,,1349,4.324110671936759

Don't wanna ruin too much of the movie but it was great seeing people turn on each other because of greed. Makes you wonder, does money really turn people like that? (if you haven't read the synopsis, its basically about a bunch of people being trapped in the house and are forced into a situation where only one of them is allowed to survive, along with receiving 5 million dollars) The best part of this movie for me was the ending tho.

2464740,4,B000CGX7FW,"What an intense movie! The whole time I was watching I was leaned forward with my palms sweating! The plot was deliciously unpredictable as well, especially with the ending.

Basically the movie involves 9 strangers getting locked into a mansion and are forced to kill each other in order to leave, while the lone survivor is promised 5 million dollars in cash prize. The cast in this movie was amazing, especially Dennis Hopper, who played an Irish catholic priest who seemed to be losing his faith. You really get to know each of the characters well as the movie progresses on too, and as more and more people begin to die off you feel the intensity grow along with it.

In my opinion the director really did a good job in showing the power of greed and the savagery of the human nature in this movie. The soundtrack for the movie was also totally awesome, with genres spanning from hip-hop to piano sonatas. It really stands out compared to other films.",1137110400,5,956,4.584795321637427

I do enjoy these trapped in house or small places horror films. this one was similar to the rest but still was very entertaining. I loved Dennis Hopper's character he did a great job playing the priest and so did Kelly Brook who played Lea, and Hippolyte Girardot who played Francis and Raffaello Degrutolla who played Jay, everyone was great. Spoiler:  I kind of knew that Francis was the one to go nuts. the movie was very enjoyable. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do, P.S.

8098946,1,B000CGX7FW,"It was an okay movie nothing exciting. I was not a fan of the black rapper who was accused of killing the white mans wife when he didn't do it and it was the white man himself. After the incident suddenly here comes the cop threatening to shoot the unarmed black man, locks him up in a room, all the white people are at the table eating including the killer himself while the black man is locked in a room banging on the door for them to let him out; says he is hungry, However no one pays him any attention and they all continue eating. Moments later the white man comes in the room hands the black guy a potato and seconds later the black guy is found hanging from a pole in the room yet no one knows who killed him and they say maybe he just killed himself and go about their business. My question is why didn't they nicely place the black guys body in the basement like they did the other two who died before him instead of just leaving him there hanging (literally) the image of slavery. So no not a fan of this racist movie, blame the black man...it's still going on today. The best part of the movie was the end.",1487635200,,1119,4.114155251141552
