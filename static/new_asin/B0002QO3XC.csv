8030908,5,B0002QO3XC,My elementary students think PJ is hilarious!  Little do they know they are learning about the instruments while they watch PJ act silly!  Great way to introduce instruments or to leave for a sub!,1396915200,,196,4.735294117647059
8030909,5,B0002QO3XC,"I have this set on VHS and was thrilled to see it on DVD.  My only complaint is that the color isn't as clear on the DVD playing through my smart board as it is on the VHS.  I may need to adjust the color also....Either way, PJ's quirky enough for the kids to enjoy and he gets the needed information across to the kids without boring them to death.  As an elementary band director and music teacher, I think these are a MUST have for your classroom.",1307404800,,450,4.090909090909091
8030910,5,B0002QO3XC,"This is a fine five DVD set that provides an entertaining introduction to musical instruments.  Having one DVD for each of the four instrument families (Brass, Percussion, String and Woodwind) and a DVD devoted to Keyboards, this production is appropriate for grades 3-5.",1301184000,,271,5.3023255813953485
8030911,5,B0002QO3XC,What an excellent collection of teaching about instruments.  I recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys having fun while learning!!!,1300492800,,138,5.9
8030912,5,B0002QO3XC,"I bought these DVDs after having the VHS tapes in my library at my last school.  They're getting older in style(very 90's), but the kids don't seem to mind.  It's a great way of exploring the different instrument families with a mini plot and some humor.  My kids love the ""Brain Blast"" summary for each instrument, and they seem to think PJ is really funny.  I would use these as young as 1st grade to perhaps 5th.  After that, some middle schoolers think they're a little too juvenile.  There's some great information, and you can make some simple worksheets and activities to accompany.  They're each about half an hour, so they're GREAT FOR A SUB DAY!  Music teachers out there know what I mean.  Amazon seemed to have the best deal, too.  Music stores sell them for much more.",1291248000,,781,4.553956834532374
