Like I just said, on a positive note, I did greatly enjoy the production quality of this movie -- the sound and camerawork were superb.  On the negative side, the continuity of this film is not at all clear from moment to moment as the main character is apparently imagining historical Zoroastrian figures from history.  Also, right off the bat, not only was it unrealistic that the girl's grandfather looked absolutely nothing like he could be her grandfather, much less a Parsee (he's Anglo-German), but in the very beginning of the film he's on his deathbed with full color in his cheeks and skin, looking nothing at all like a man actually dying.  Could makeup not have been applied to make him look as a genuine dying man, due to some disease of old age?  These sorts of things not only make it hard for the audience to endure the film, it even makes it harder for the actor him- or herself to more fully get into the right sense of character.

A few other things:  After all those years spent living with her grandfather, we are to believe she learned nothing of Zoroastrianism from him?  Or did she?  From watching the film, I still have no idea.  After that, the whole idea of a book she couldn't read because parts were written in dead languages ended up being silly because either she did somehow magically learn to read it, or she didn't.  And beyond that, at one point, she's sitting at the table with her childhood sweetheart or whatever, and the script has him saying that the words are magically shifting and all that, and I'm just rolling my eyes at that.

Secondly, the star of this film should've had an acting supervisor to keep her from doing what she did for too much of the film:  be too precious.  She seems too concerned to make sure that she's captured as this innocent and ethereal ingenue, and an outside acting supervisor or even someone directing the film who wasn't herself, could probably have prevented that.

If the whole point of any fictional story is for the writer to what you want the end message is to be, but to figure out how to get to that end in the most plausibly elegant way, I feel like this film fails that test.  We have all these things happening in the film, but none of those things lead up to the actual end of the film and the almost thrownaway central moral messages of Zoroastranism.  There's a phrase ""Deus Ex Machina"" which refers to a writer doing whatever it takes to just resolve the story somehow at the end and get it over with already, and I think that phrase applies to the scripting for this story.

Finally, I find myself wondering who this film was intended for.  Is it the Zoroastrian community, who already knews what the references mean?  Or was the the non-Zoroastrian community, who mostly has no idea?  This is just another important way this film lacks clarity of continuity by lacking clarity of purpose.

Ultimately, I was glad to a superficially high-quality film made about Zarathustra, but out of service to the subject matter I really do feel I have to point out these things about this film, in order that lessons be learned for the future.  I'm not here to cut the creator of the film down to size in any sadistic or self-serving way, but these things should be said.",1473292800,,3636,4.551459293394777
