5990595,5,B00FFLBXI2,Great music by a great artist . Time stood still for George. He will always be a rocker of feel good music.,1395100800,,107,3.909090909090909
5990596,3,B00FFLBXI2,Good sound & picture quality. George's voice showing the signs of his age but still great rock n roll viewing.,1394755200,,110,4.55
5990597,3,B00FFLBXI2,"Not a great fan, so I think my opinion is not relevant. The sound and video are great. I'm happy with this BD.",1394150400,,110,3.8260869565217392
5990598,4,B00FFLBXI2,"like another reviewer mentioned, the lighting sucks.but thorogood and the destroyers are typical thorogood and destroyers and still in kick but form.hot all of the show has the bad lighting but definitely has its moments.but even though the lighting isn't good, its worth getting if you're a thorogood fan.theyre in typical form and put on a good performance.",1392076800,,359,5.206896551724138
5990599,3,B00FFLBXI2,Fantastic concert by George Thorogood and the Destroyers. They are always polished performers and put on a brilliant show. Hope they return to New Zealand some day soon. unfortunately the stage lighting really ruins this DVD. Lots of Blue and Pink lights that make the performers really hard too see especially their facial expressions. This happens right through the DVD though the first song is definitely the worse where this appalling lighting is evident right through it. I own many Concert DVD's and this would have to be the worst for this. Shame because George Thorogood and the Destroyers are such a class act.,1390435200,,619,4.961538461538462
5990600,5,B00FFLBXI2,"Great presentation. Audio and Video are fantastic. The only downside is that the show is only 82 minutes, but for less than 20 bucks you get a great show and you don't have to tip your bartender (as opposed to being at a Thorogood show live).",1385424000,4,242,4.282608695652174
5990601,4,B00FFLBXI2,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but I just can't. I have been a fan of George Thorogoods long before ""bad to the bone"" and in fact saw him in his first club date in Southern California 3 plus decades ago!  It is a pretty good set list but not nearly long enough (84 min.) for a 5 star rating.  George and the band perform well enough and the Montreux shows are always filmed great.  There is a 4 minute interview that is fun.  George isn't quite as active on guitar as back in the day , but its still fun to watch him play fingerstyle slide on his Gibson's, and the band is the same tight band he's had for years.

I recommend this to fans of his and to fans of rootsy bluesy rock in general. As I said, with BR concerts on the market that feature nearly 3 times this much music for the same price I can't give this 5 stars for value but I am sure HAPPY to be an owner and will play this over and over.....",1385164800,7,904,3.891304347826087
