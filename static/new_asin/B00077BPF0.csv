2203821,4,B00077BPF0,"Ah, it great to see Disney finally cutting loose from their film vault this and other great live-action films.  Kurt Russell and especially Hayley Mills were true bread and butter income for a host of Disney films and were personal favorites of Uncle Walt himself.  But why oh why does Disney treat these two wonderful actor's films to lousy Pan & Scan transfers?  Of the six Mills pictures, only half are in their OAR.  As far as Russell, I think only one of his flicks is in its OAR, ""Now You See Him, Now You Don't""!  A sad, sad situation for 2008 technology and an insult to both of these fine actors.

UPDATE: 04.29.08

As someone has kindly pointed out that this movie was an open matte from a 1.85:1 print, you wonder why they would do this, especially back in 1971?  Disney's logic continues to befuddle even today.",1112745600,18,823,4.476510067114094

2203841,4,B00077BPF0,"My kids liked it.  They like the old Kurt Russell Disney movies.  Whether your kids will enjoy them depends on their exposure to other media.  These films were made when kids didn't watch adult television and movies on a regular basis.  If your kids are saturated with more sophisticated plot lines, special effects, violence, and the like, then forget it.  They'll probably get bored.  But if there is any purity left in your chid, then they will find these films as entertaining and delightful as I did when I was young, and they will look back at them fondly.",1441152000,,562,4.626262626262626

2203845,5,B00077BPF0,"I love the Disney movies that have Kurt Russell as a young adult, which include this and a trio of college-kid comedies (The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, Now You See Him Now You Don't, and The Strongest Man in the World).  This is a more serious drama than the college comedies.  But what I love about Disney's late 60s/early 70s movies is how lighthearted they are in the midst of serious subject matter.  Kurt Russell plays Steven Post, who wants to become a TV executive and discovers a way to advance because his girlfriend's chimpanzee can predict the shows the American people will like.  An animal who can make its owner rich was also the basis of the plot to Disney's Million Dollar Duck, in the same era.  The Barefoot Executive is about the price of success.  The story is filled with suspense, generated not by filmmaking technique like Hitchcock but instead by Kurt Russell's moral crisis and our perpetual realization that this secret way he's advancing his career can't be sustained.  But with Disney in this era, you know you are investing your emotions in a story that will resolve well.  I really like the values.  There is also some funny comedy, coming from Joe Flynn, Wally Cox, and Harry Morgan.  I love it when Harry Morgan gets riled up on a movie.  He was in a number of Disney movies, and always memorable.",1427760000,,1330,4.617021276595745

There are plenty of tongue-in-cheeks comments and some funny lines in this comedy that features such tv veterans as Harry Morgan, Joe Flynn, Wally Cox, Hayden Roarke, Alan Hewitt, and Heather North adds to the fun.

There are a number of scenes that made us laugh, especially one out on a window ledge where Wally Cox and Joe Flynn kept us laughing for almost ten minutes with their classic screwball expressions and antics.
Kurt Russell has a girlfriend,but there is not even any sexual innuendo.
The chimp is cute and funny.

2203881,5,B00077BPF0,"Some beloved films from our childhood should not be seen again because they really were junk.  This one is the opposite.

Not only do I still crack up (in my mid-40s) at this film, but my kids know almost every line.  The script has to be awesome to do that for a picky movie connoisseur such as moi!

This film gives you more than just a funny plot from start to finish. You get some of the most quotable lines of any one film.  I can still hear lines like Joe Flynn's ""you've got a reverse gear in this thing"" and ""come on little fella, you're gonna love it"" and Ritter sneering ""Moonrise night School"" and the Irish-stereotyped Father MulCahey saying ""there's no prablum that cannut be salved"" and the jack-hammer guy wobbling his head as he says ""I knew it all the time.""  Believe me, that snorting laugh of Wally Cox will break the ice at parties!  The scene of Joe Flynn and Wally Cox on the ledge is guaranteed to belly-laugh you out of the worst of moods.

And by the way, the stock review for this film says that Kurt Russell is Steven Stone.  oops!  Sorry, but he is Steven Post.  (Could this be a word-play on his role of delivering the inter-office ""post"" as a mailboy?)  Maybe they should have watched the flick first, before telling others about it.

His name in this one is a break from Dexter Riley in his other three blockbusters, although surrounded by the same veteran actors.  I guess Disney was trying to let him grow up.  I'd have preferred to let him still be Dexter, but just in a new chapter of life, as his loyal fans are too.

Enjoy it with the next generation, over and over!",1165276800,6,1603,4.328859060402684
2203882,4,B00077BPF0,"I am delighted to see that two of my favorite Disney films have been released on dvd, ""Million Dollar Duck"" and ""The Barefoot Executive.""  Descriptions of the plots for these movies are already noted here, but I will say that both these films are very enjoyable family viewing.  I can remember going to the theater as a child and watching these films, and I still enjoy them today. Nobody's claiming they're the best films ever, or even the best Disney films ever, just good, fun entertainment in the grand Disney tradition. Some have complained about these films not being released in their original aspect ratio's, or being remastered for dvd.  Although I would have preferred them released letterboxed as well, neither film was released in a very wide aspect ratio, so they play fine on tv, and as for Disney using the same masters they used for the vhs releases and tv airings, if that's what they did, big deal.  Those prints are fine.  Sharp, clear pictures, with good color. Sure, it would have been nice to have remastered letterboxed versions on dvd, but be grateful we have them on dvd at all.  They've both been a long time coming.",1115337600,6,1142,4.685
2203883,2,B00077BPF0,"First of all, I must say ""The Barefoot Executive"", which was Kurt Russell's second starring role in his early Disney period, is a wonderful, comic farce.  It has a terrific supporting cast, including the hilarious comedy team of Joe Flynn and Wally Cox, an early appearance by the late John Ritter, and a pleasing turn by Heather North as Russell's love interest.  And then there's Russell's costar, a chimp who can predict hit TV shows, well-played by Bubbles.  His ""talent"" comes in handy when ambitious mailboy Russell uses his predictions to get ahead at the television network he works at.  In all, it's a funny farce that kids and their parents will enjoy.

Alas, I cannot recommend this film for purchase at this time.  And here are five reasons why:

1.  Disney DVD has once again made the head-scratching decision to release ""Barefoot Executive"" in a full-screen format, instead of widescreen.  Why?  Who knows.  This is extremely annoying, especially since it was undoubtedly filmed in the family friendly 1:66:1 aspect ratio.  Heck, my 3 year old niece has no problem with those black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  Why should anyone else?

2.  There is nothing to lead me to believe this film has been restored.  Therefore, we're evidently getting the same tired print from the VHS version.  Why replace something with something that is no better than what you already have?

3.  There are absolutely no special features.  None.

4.  The retail price of $19.99 is ridiculously expensive for a bare-bones DVD.  Most comparable DVDs are priced at $9.99 or less, so Disney should be ashamed of themselves for ripping the customer off.

5.  As I said before, 1+2+3+4=ONE BIG RIPOFF.

So, my verdict, thumbs down to Disney and this package.  I'd like to thank them, however, for saving me money.  Not buying this, ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."", and ""Million Dollar Duck"" will save me anywhere from $45-$60 that I can use to buy product from other DVD companies, like Anchor Bay, for instance, that values its customers enough to present us with topnotch, worthy product.

*** (out of *****)for the film; * for the DVD; ** overall",1113264000,16,2145,4.8319559228650135
2203884,4,B00077BPF0,"If it seems like Kurt Russell has been around forever it's because he HAS!  He's been acting since 1957.  He was 20 years old when he made this movie in 1951, but still was that fresh-faced kid we'd come to know in ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" done a few years before.  Although it seems like it since once again Joe Flynn is a co-star, this was not a part of the Dexter Riley series of films.  Other co-stars include Wally Cox, Harry Morgan, and an equally young John Ritter.

Russell plays Steven Post who works in the mail room of a big television network.  Steven discovers that his girlfriend's pet chimp can pick TV ratings winners and soon as the network execs buzzing.  Joe Flynn and Wally Cox play off each other hilariously in this film.  Flynn was always so much fun to watch with that always perturbed look on his face and wondering ""why me?"".  Ritter actually plays the snobby nephew to the head of the studio who gets his just desserts in the end.

Hey, these things were not classics but they were good and fun family movies the type of which you don't see anymore.  Disney did so well at these types of things in the 60's and early 1970's  Nice to see they are releasing them on DVD as well.",1112745600,,1211,4.333333333333333

appreciate it - but now that I've watched it again, it's pretty good, maybe Disney's smartest release of that era.  The idea of a chimpanzee
picking hit TV shows gives this picture a resemblance to a junior version of ""Network"", although it's hard to imagine Paddy Chayefsky
writing for Kurt Russell and a chimp.  (Favorite scene: Russell substitutes ""Devil Dan"", one of the chimp's picks, for a loser called
""The Happy Harringtons"" at a network premiere party; Russell is fired - but reinstated and promoted the next day when ""Devil Dan""
wins its time slot.) In addition, any movie about TV that brings together the likes of Colonel Potter, Captain Binghamton, Jack Tripper
and Underdog - respectively, Harry Morgan, Joe Flynn, John Ritter, and Wally Cox - would know its stuff.  (Maybe one quibble can
be said - if the chimp can really pick good shows, how did ""Me and the Chimp"" merit a prime-time spot while ""Lancelot Link""
was relegated to Saturday morning? What's your theory, Darwin?)",1520899200,,1125,4.818652849740933
