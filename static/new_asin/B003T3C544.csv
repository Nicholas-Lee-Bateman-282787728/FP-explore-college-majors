8404956,3,B003T3C544,"What is up with Universal Studios?  Do they not take American money anymore?  Why did they release the first six seasons of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' and then abandon the project, leaving the seventh season of 'Presents' and all three seasons of 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' unavailable for release in America?  The seventh season of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' was released in 2013 in Australia.  Region 4 DVD.
While pondering this idiocy, I decided to purchase a region free DVD player.  I was very much impressed with the last season of 'Presents'.  Hitchcock's half hour series ended on a strong note with some truly creepy stories, including a restored version of the controversial and unaired final episode, 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' with Brandon de Wilde and Diana Dors.
I had mistakenly thought that this collection would feature the entire first season, and was very disappointed to note that it only contains ten episodes from the first season.
Which leads me back to Universal. I find it hard to believe that there was no market for more 'Alfred HItchcock' TV DVDs.  The DVD industry outputs much garbage.  This year's hot new movie is in next year's Walmart bargain bin collecting dust.  It's not 'art', it's planned obsolescence.  As an ancient old gas, I truly get a kick out of seeing these classic Hitchcock episodes restored...and yes, I still enjoy a classic 'Twilight Zone' every now and then.
The whole 'region coding' of DVDs seems like nonsense only a control freak could dream up.  If you really love these old Hitchcock's, just buy yourself a region free DVD player.  I'm not waiting for Universal to decide when I want to watch my Hitchcock.  From other comments I have read, I am certainly not the only one annoyed with Universal.  The last straw was never marketing the final seventh season of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' for America. What is up with that?  Seems like I bought the sixth season over three years ago.
Good luck trying to find 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour'.  I bought a 'home made' set from a seller on ebay.  Would much rather have 'restored' versions.
Some of the episodes are available online, most of them aren't.  I have NO idea if Universal ever plans to release the three seasons of 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' and perhaps the idiots forgot that 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' did have a seventh season! I'm sure a release of this material would bring a tidy profit to Universal, perhaps more than that stupid movie no one is ever going to watch again, which is now collecting dust at Walmart.",1447718400,6,2540,4.867441860465116
8404957,5,B003T3C544,I gave 5 stars because I've loved this show since I was a child but it's upsetting to not being able to purchase for the US or even instant video. Will be ecstatic when Universal finally releases this brilliant classic television show,1447113600,,234,4.595238095238095
8404958,4,B003T3C544,"The first season of the Hitchcock hour was not the best but it had some fine episodes, among them, my ""ugly duckling"" favorite, Night Of the Owl. This basically new series, which told stories in greater depth and more character development than the half-hours, had, as one might imagine, some trouble finding an identity for itself, as something different from the earlier and highly popular Hitchcock series. By the second half of the first season things began to pick up, and by the start of the next season the show was moving in some offbeat and very interesting directions, as it rather morphed into a horror series, much of the time anyway, by the third and final season. Overall, a fine show, and one that should satisfy fans of Alfred Hitchcock, mystery and suspense tales, and the occasional blood and thunder horror story. There was a little something for everyone on the hour long show, though for those who prefer their TV shows wholesome Hitchcock's most assuredly was not that.",1445904000,2,991,4.8352941176470585

8404962,1,B003T3C544,"OK, maybe I'm in the minority with regard to the tastes of today's viewers and collectors of classic, great TV shows from long, long ago.

I love anything Alfred Hitchcock was associated with, and his work on both THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR and THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (30 minute episodes) TV series' were and still are two of the best series that was on TV both here in the U.S. and most everywhere else.  The quality that went into the production of each episode was very high and uncommon for TV back in the 1950's - 1960's.  Hitchcock picked the best stories with great writers and directors (Hitch would occasionally direct an episode himself as a treat for the fans).  Many new and up-coming actors began their careers on TV and in shows like The Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Alfred Hitchcock Hour as well as in episodes of Twilight Zone.

The shows I remember watching as a kid were the Hitchcock shows, Twilight Zone, Thriller (hosted by Boris Karloff), The Outer Limits and One Step Beyond just to name a few.

I have all seasons of Hitchcock's Presents on DVD and I have re-played them many times as they still are remarkably clever and well-made and re-watchable where most shows made today are not.

What I don't understand is why these shows are not made available on DVD (or blu-ray) for fans of these shows here in the U.S.  Universal owns the rights to both of these shows and has only released the first 4 seasons of Hitchcock's Presents on DVD without any promise to release the rest of the seasons or any of Hitch's Hour shows. I can't believe that Hitch's shows don't sell enough to make it worthwhile for Universal to put them on DVD. Universal sure doesn't spend any money or take the time to remaster Hitch's series' (which is something a fan has had to live with), because we're just happy to have the first four seasons.

I'm hoping Universal will decide to let another company to distribute these shows so that people like me who love them can some day own them.

But I'm not holding my breath waiting for Universal or any distributor to make these available.",1300924800,36,2091,4.581769436997319
