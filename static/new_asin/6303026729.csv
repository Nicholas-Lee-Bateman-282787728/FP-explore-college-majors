7834886,3,6303026729,"This video starts with the Byrds' classic ""Eight miles high,"" only problem it's a performance that dates from the early 70's when they had turned into a Grateful Dead-ish hippie jam band-the funky instrumental you hear is only recognizahle as the classic song when Roger boredly plays the signature riff early on.  I wouldn't have minded it so much if they had put this at the end with the credits running over it.  Besides that, you get good stuff from bands like the Who, Small Faces, Thunderclap Newman, and Blue Cheer, but it's all lip-synched. The only other actual live performance is the closing number by the Nice, which is more prog than psychedelic. Not as good as the Heavy Metal video of this series, or the British Invasion one.",974419200,,741,4.6923076923076925
