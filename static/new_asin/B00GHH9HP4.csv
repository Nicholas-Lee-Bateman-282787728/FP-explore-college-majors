6075469,5,B00GHH9HP4,This was a terrific film. I will start by saying don't expect Undisputed 2 or 3 if you do then you will not enjoy this film. I love those movies but this is more of a drama between a man and his daughter with some well done fight scenes. The fight scenes are more hand to hand style and not a lot of mixed martial arts. The movie is very well acted and displays some touching scenes while it builds the relationships and emotions of these men and their lives. I would recommend it if you like Korean drama and if you are a fight movie fan I would say give it a chance because it is just a great film period. I would say it is South Korea's answer to the Rocky Series.,1397433600,4,667,3.985074626865672
6075470,4,B00GHH9HP4,"In a way, I was pleasantly surprised with this Korean action/drama hybrid: sure, it's about fighting, but it at least makes an attempt to fill the holes with layered, likable characters.  The three main characters, once high school friends, meet again as part of a popular new TV show that pits amateur (and aging) athletes against established fighters in an MMA setting.  The fight scenes are very well done, while there's plenty of drama and character development that help us get to know these three characters, both as kids and adults.

The movie runs a bit too long at 156 minutes, which is almost double the length of your average fighting movie.  It's almost two movies in one, for better or worse, and some of the drama is a little overcooked.  Still, the charismatic performances, fight scenes and ambition help to smooth over some of the rough edges, and the Blu-ray presentation isn't bad either.  The picture (1080p widescreen) and sound (5.1 or 2.0, available in Korean or English) are both first rate, plus four short but enjoyable featurettes are also included.  It's definitely worth a look, though anyone expecting non-stop fighting won't get their wish.",1393977600,4,1171,4.9438775510204085
6075471,5,B00GHH9HP4,Saw this movie in NY and i'm to see it out on Bluray/DVD.  It's a movie about 3 older street fighters from rival high schools who are invited to a fighting tournament. Not going to give away to much but each has something to prove and are all linked to an incident that happened in their youth. It's got plenty of action and the story is good and worth adding to any collection.,1392681600,4,378,4.178082191780822

8623068,5,B00GHH9HP4,"I can't get over how awesome Fists of Legend was! It had everything! Schoolyard fights! Friendship! Bullying! Drama! Middle-aged guys learning mixed martial arts! Repeated use of ""Eye of the Tiger""! It even featured a piece of Spam. If you want to see a movie about dudes who were legendary fighters in their school days facing off years after their glory days, this is your movie. And if you don't want to see that, I don't have any respect for you.",1434412800,,450,4.567901234567901

8623071,3,B00GHH9HP4,"When I say that this film is a GONE WITH THE WIND, I don't mean that it entails civil war or slavery. Instead I'm talking about a story that seems to dwell forever and feels like the entire 154 minute length it runs. With a little trimming this film could have been better but at that length, while still a good movie, it seems a bit over the top.

The story revolves around a television program in Korea, a show where the producers try to bring together the toughest street fighters they can find. Week after week they bring out both forgotten heroes from the past and new toughs trying to make a name for themselves. Unfortunately the ratings are beginning to fall, especially with the same names appearing week after week.

That changes when they discover Deok-kyu, an ex-Olympic contender who disappeared and now runs a noodle shop that's about to go under. Raising a child on his own he's done everything he could to steer clear of the fight circuit. But with some cajoling by the producer and with the enticement of a $200,000 top prize, he's drawn back in.

Not only is Deok-kyu brought back but so are two friends from his past. Jae-seok was the friend that never quite made it to the top and is now a low level gangster. Sang-hoon is an executive now whose boss wants him to take the top prize and represent the company at the same time. Each has a reason for wanting to win. Each reason is something personal to the individual. Just who will rise to the top waits to be seen until the very last battle.

Unlike most movies in this genre there is more story here than you usually find. The tale of Deok-kyu is heart wrenching at times, giving his choices more substance than in the usual martial arts film. And yet the story of his ex-friends and their need to win also draws you in. The fact that a movie like this offers that much in the way of plot sets this movie above many that have been released.

If you're a fan of martial arts films then this is a must see film. If you've never given them a chance then this one is worth watching. You'll get more from this than most and in the end that's a good thing.",1409356800,,2122,4.321608040201005
