1239317,1,B00000JZIJ,"For some reason, whenever Hollywood tries to make a movie out of a Joseph Wambaugh novel, the film tends to fall flat. And ""The Onion Field"" is a good example of how a good book can be turned into a bad film.
""The Onion Field"" has all the makings of a good film: A good cast, high drama and a true-life story with a poignant message. However, this film does not make full use of these characteristics and the end result is a movie that never realizes its potential. If anything, ""The Onion Field"" is a long, boring film that leaves you feeling empty and drained.",987552000,6,562,4.311320754716981
1239318,5,B00000JZIJ,"""The Onion Field"" brought up the tail end of a ""golden era"" of intelligent, gripping and realistic American crime dramas that began with 1967's ""In Cold Blood"", and continued through the 70's with films like ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"". Director Harold Becker (""City Hall"", ""Sea Of Love"") assembles the perfect cast to portray the true story of a kidnapping and cold-blooded murder of an L.A. police officer in 1963. John Savage's usually distracting tics and twitches are put to good use as the high-strung, guilt-ridden cop who survives the harrowing incident. James Woods infuses his edgy, psychotic cop-killer with an underlying native intelligence that makes him even more frightening than usual. Newcomer Franklyn Seales is quite memorable in a layered performance as Woods' conflicted accomplice (unfortunately, Seales all but vanished after this potentially star-making role). Ted Danson and Ronny Cox also give excellent support. The scene dramatizing the ""onion field incident"" itself chills the viewer with the same unblinking realism that made ""In Cold Blood""'s deliberate, step-by-step re-enactment of the Clutter killings so haunting. The film can also be seen as an unflinching look at the American justice system, and the resulting lose/lose scenarios that sometimes occur on both sides of the docket. Riveting and unforgettable.",984960000,39,1351,5.531400966183575
1239319,4,B00000JZIJ,"A rather surreal tale from Wambaugh,s pen about two policeman, one of whom is disturbed and tortured because he let his partner ( Ted Danson) be  murdered by a sadistic James Woods. ( so he thinks).
John Savage plays  the tortured officer who cant live with the sight of the execution of his  partner and the reality of the impotence of the criminal justice system  that still pulls him apart years after the incident.
The film plays  almost like a documentary and Woods is truly chilling. Matching him and  going beyond is Franklin Seales a bizzare interloper into Woods, family. He  is truly even more disturbing than Woods if thats possible.
Whats being  said in this film is very depressing and it jumps out at you !",969321600,8,720,4.6141732283464565

1239336,3,B00000JZIJ,"Joseph Wambaugh was a red-hot writer in the 1970s, and his novels flew off bookshelvesbut the film version of THE CHOIRBOYS was such a critical disaster that Wambaugh sued to have his name removed from the film and decided to produce the movie version of his true-crime book THE ONION FIELD himself.  This gave him absolute control of the film, but while the movie was faithful to the book, the result was a little too exacting to make for an entirely successful film.

Both book and film tell the story of two Los Angeles police officers, Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger, who were kidnapped by two career criminals, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Smith, who drove Campbell and Hettinger to an onion field near Bakersfield.  Once there, one officer was shot to death and the other escaped, and Powell and Smith were arrested not long after.  The case was held up by the LAPD as an example of what not to do, and the surviving officer suffered debilitating PTSD; the criminals, however, benefited from changes in California law and filed repeated appeals.

The first portion of the film follows the officers and criminals up to the crime, and it plays very well, with James Wood particularly memorable as Gregory Powell; the remaining portion of the film, which follows the surviving officers ordeal and the criminals court battles, has interest but less drive.  Ultimately, however, this 1979 film feels a bit like a made-for-television movie of its era, with the whole thing having a sanitized for your protection quality.  The movie also has an implied happy ending that didn't actually occur.

Its interesting, and worth watching, but it is also rather slow and somewhat dated.  Recommended, but only just.  The book is better!

1239351,3,B00000JZIJ,"I have wanted to see this film for decades and finally saw it.  The story did not disappoint me; although, the dialogue and acting styles are unconvincing--except for a younger and very sinister James Woods; he is outstanding.  As usual, Ted Danson gives a flat performance as does his mother, Priscilla Pointer.  Franklyn Seales' performance as an ex-con conned into committing a horrible crime is a tad fresher and newer than Amos and Andy but he was unconvincing.  The very end was supposed to be a mother's poignant recollection of her son but it was wooden at best.

Truthfully, the acting was so bad that I'm surprised these folks, except for James Woods, ever got work again in Hollywood.

The story is excellent and you should watch the film if just to see the 1960's criminal justice system at work.",1471996800,,808,4.735714285714286

1239374,3,B00000JZIJ,too much focus on trying  to portray the criminals whose characters were not worthy of a story. If there is a story it is about the lasting effects of senseless crime on the surviving victims and the justice system.

1239375,4,B00000JZIJ,A very good portrayal of the true incident of two Los Angeles police officers being taken prisoner by two petty thieves.  They are taken out close to Bakersfield in the onion fields where one office is murdered and the other escaped.  The murderers are captured and tried.  Once in prison they learn how to work the system to get retried  over and over again.  The movie tries to show how the officer who lived had his life altered to the point of near suicide.  Early portrayal of PTSD before it was verified as an illness.

Little things he says and does ""nail"" the intensity of the character he plays. When he robs the liquor store, he does this ""hop step"" to quicken his escape, but without being too obvious as to actually be seen running from the crime.

Not for children or squeamish.

1239432,4,B00000JZIJ,"I hadn't seen THE ONION FIELD IN 30 years (on commercial tv) so seeing this uncut was quite a treat even if final 20 minutes - revived by the ""oh no"" gut-wrenching, ""babysitting"" scene - drags and doesn't seem to know when or just how to end!
THE ONION FIELD is where one cop's personal nightmare begins and continues because of legal system formalities.  Reliving the crime in testimony over and over inevitably causes psychological trauma for Officer Hettinger (John Savage).
James Woods sent his career in motion with his performance of a career criminal.  His character, as we eventually learn, is much more than just manipulating.  He is a bulls*** artist, despicable, and quite intelligent!  Very learn-ed before all is said and done.
That said, the point of this true story seems to be (especially back in 1963) that the law bends (bent) over backwards for the rights of the criminal.
John Savage and Franklin Seales (career thief - really doesn't know who parents were - talk about never having a chance) also give very convincing performances showcasing scenes sometimes difficult to watch by the ""real"" discomfort we (the viewer) get to 'feel' of someone in a very trying, private and/or personal moment (a crying, disturbed bedroom scene AND a public crying shower scene come to mind).
This movie just misses being a terrific character study in the same vein as In Cold Blood.
If you are looking for an action movie like Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour or even 48 Hrs (note sequels and comic references) you may be looking up the wrong cop movie tree.  Again, Joseph Wambaugh's THE ONION FIELD does deserve comparison to Capote's novel turned movie.
There is very good authentic dialogue (of the street) as well as that simpler feeling for the 1960's.  Were these cops a little naive?
And THE ONION FIELD, re-lived, is a nightmare of inevitable tears echoing in those multiple screams.  It is stories like this that helped in the rehabilitation process of suffering law enforcement officials.",1456963200,,1999,4.896449704142012

It has a dated look - nowhere near as slick as, say, The Godfather, which predates it by several years - and seems to have been deliberately filmed in the style of the early 1960s it aims to capture. The narrative is weak in spots. On the plus side, James Woods turns in a powerful performance as the small-time, violent hood at the film's center. In addition to the vivid depiction of LA's gritty 1963 underbelly, the film's exploration of America's often frustrating judicial process and of capital punishment versus life in prison has contemporary resonance.

1239471,1,B00000JZIJ,"This review is only about the quality of this Blu-ray, not about the content of the film, which I have always felt is a wonderful film.

However, this is one of the 3 worst Blu-rays I've ever seen out of about 300 that I own covering many decades. From the very opening of the movie, the picture is in extremely soft focus, then at about 2:45, in the next scene, it becomes only reasonably focused, but absolutely nothing like typical Blu-ray quality for movies from ANY decade. The color has absolutely been un-retouched, it seems, leaving a very bland, old-looking color palette for the entire film, except that there are frequent, purplish skin tones--yikes!  This Blu-ray picture quality is really no better than that of my DVD of this movie, which is ALSO fully anamorphic, or 16 x 9, and DOESN'T have the purplish skin tones. It also has a cleaner picture (almost no dirt or artifacts) than this Blu-ray, as the BR shows lots of age.  My guess at the rationale for why that is so is that this Blu-ray was made approximately 15 years after the DVD came out, so the film master has probably aged and developed dirt and artifacts primarily during this 15-year period. Though the color has not been enhanced at all, as noted, the movie has been lightened a bit, so the picture is probably a hair better than the DVD picture on this one score; but on the other hand, it makes the opening scene of the movie, a sunny morning panning of homes in a Southern California neighborhood, more evident for its soft focus and other weaknesses in the BR picture quality.

Furthermore, this Blu-ray contains no subtitles, unlike the DVD. It has almost identical extras, although the Blu-ray's documentary looks sharper than the same documentary on the DVD, and the Blu-ray does have one additional extra, a high-definition, 10-minute interview with star John Savage that was made in 2015 and looks beautiful.

Overall, I cannot see why anyone would purchase this highly disappointing Blu-ray if he/she already has the DVD, and I wish to return this Blu-ray for the major disappointment it has provided in terms of the weak picture quality. This simply looks like an old DVD of a weak-colored movie, not like a Blu-ray of any kind.  Really, this is a very poor effort on the part of Kino Lorber.

I strongly recommend against this purchase, unless you have no prior version of this film, in which case the Blu-ray is certainly acceptable to view. As long as you don't mind something that looks like average-or-worse DVD quality for an old movie, without ANY enhancement in the Blu-ray mastering process.

Another of the one-star reviewers here has other criticisms but says the Hi-Def picture quality is excellent.  That is FAR from true, perhaps he's never viewed any other Blu-rays before; the Blu-ray review websites are highly critical of this one's picture quality.  EVERY Blu-ray I have of 1970s and 1960s  films blows this one away as to quality, and this is over 150 Blu-rays of films from just those two decades.

Very disappointing.  I can't believe that they thought customers would enjoy this very poor picture quality in a Blu-ray.",1451347200,2,3132,4.767097966728281

1239534,1,B00000JZIJ,"(The Onion Field is a good psychological/crime drama. This comment and the 1-star rating refer only to the Kino Lorber blu-ray release). The Amazon specs for the blu-ray incorrectly state that it has English subtitles. This is a movie Ive always enjoyed, and I got my hopes up thinking that Kino Lorber had finally seen the light and included English subtitles for all those home video viewers who consider them a necessary feature. No such luck. Why Kino Lorber and Olive Films think that subtitles and closed-captions are just a frill that viewers can do without is beyond me. The high definition video is great but if you cant hear all the dialogue its pretty much worthless. Im guessing that about half the target audience for these older classics want the option to turn on English subtitles for various reasons, including having less than perfect hearing, being a non-native English speaker, or like me, they just like to watch movies at home late at night at low volume with the subtitles turned on. Lets face it, my hearing isn't getting any better with age. If I invest in blu-ray movies I want to be able to watch them ten or fifteen years from now, and Im betting there are millions of movie lovers in this country who feel the same way. It would cost the studios a paltry sum to include a subtitle track on their disks, and they would certainly increase their sales significantly if they did.

The 1.86:1 aspect ratio image presentation doesn't have the best luck with skintones, which register normal one moment and purple-ish the next, missing consistency. Colors in general fall a little flat, only really coming to life with neon signage and brightly lit exteriors, while costuming provides a modest amount of spirit. Detail isn't inspired, flat with close-ups, delivering dull facial features and emotional nuance. Inherent cinematographic softness and focus problems are easy to spot. Grain reads on the noisy side. Delineation is merely passable, never extraordinary, with a few scenes threatened by solidification. Print is bit tattered, with speckling throughout and tiny vertical scratches, and there's a faint blue line that periodically shows up on the left side of the frame.",1434499200,2,989,5.380645161290323
1239536,3,B00000JZIJ,"When originally released, The Onion Field carried quite a punch. The film is based on a true account of a robbery gone horribly and has a great cast to boot, especially James Woods. But after revisiting the film, after all these years, it just does not hold up all that well. It's esthetic and filmic style is so locked into the era of its release, that it's distracting. The Onion Field is a worthwhile story that's still relevant and screams to be remade.",1434412800,,457,4.518072289156627
1239537,4,B00000JZIJ,"Released in 1979, The Onion Field is a true crime drama about a disturbed two-bit criminal, Greg Powell (James Wood), and his partner (Franklyn Seales) who kidnap two cops (Ted Danson and John Savage) and kill one of them in the sticks by an onion field. Can justice be done with the California court system? How will the murder affect the surviving officer?

The entire crime sequence, which takes roughly one quarter of the runtime, is outstanding. The remaining hour is a negative commentary on the justice system and survivor guilt/PTSD. The film sticks to the facts and is gritty realistic with actors who even appear like their true-life counterparts. With the exception of the crime and its immediate aftermath this is a slow drama, but somehow compelling, perhaps partially because it really happened.

Interestingly, the character played by Woods reminds me of a former good friend who was in my wedding party, also named Greg. Like the character in the film, hes currently in prison for murder!

The film runs 122 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area and Maricopa & Taft, California.

1239567,4,B00000JZIJ,"I read the book with the same name a couple of years ago, and so this movie has been a must-see for me.  However, it hasn't been available online for streaming until recently, so I finally had a chance to watch it today.

Like I've said so many times, I hate it when people say, ""The book was so much better than the movie!""  Like I've also said so many times, literature and film are different genres, to risk a useless tautology.  In my opinion, it is easier to write a good book than to make a good movie.  A book can be almost as many pages as the author wants, while a film, in general, should run two hours or less, mostly for US marketing reasons.  But this difference allows the author much more leeway when it comes to telling a story in print, while a screenplay must be whittled down to the time allotted.

However, in this case, I will assert that ""The book was better than the movie!""  But not by much.  And the screenwriter wouldn't be too mad about this statement, however, as I believe that he also wrote the book.  He probably feels the same way.

It seems that the producer and director of this film might have used ""In Cold Blood"" (ICB) -- the version with Robert Blake -- as a template, as quite a bit of the tone, particularly in the first couple of acts, is so similar.  However, I just liked that earlier film better.  Maybe because it was in widescreen lush black and white?  Maybe because it was one of the first true-crime movies out there that was actually good?  While I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Mr. Blake as an actor, I did like his very-raw portrayal in that film more than any player here, so that might be a part of it.

There is another issue, nothing that the writer could do anything about:  The officer who survived was not the most sympathetic character to me -- I thought that many of his actions were at best unwise -- while even the killers in ICB were even made to be sympathetic to some degree.  But I do believe that, perhaps, they should have considered shooting this film in black-and-white as well, due to the era of the story.  Hey, ""Schindler's List"" was filmed in black-and-white, long after color was available, and that film REALLY worked.

More like a 3.5 for me, but I'll round up because I think it's unfair to round down to 3.  But definitely worth a peek, especially if you've read the book.  Just don't be surprised if you actually like the book better.",1412035200,2,2426,4.33259423503326

1239584,3,B00000JZIJ,"The Onion Field, 1979 film

This is based on Joseph Wambaugh's book about a true crime in the early 1960s. It would've been forgotten except for this book and movie. How accurate was this movie? There is an added message against legal procedures, as if getting any retrial was immoral. In other cases, getting a retrial is needed for the innocent convicted. [Read ""Actual Innocence"" and similar books.] So what was the true history of Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith? Was their background really like what was shown in this drama? The LAPD policy is correct in ruling ""never give up your gun"" to any criminal. That's just common sense. ""Trust no one.""

This crime took place in an onion field outside of Bakersfield California. Two males were stopped in the middle of the night by two police officers on patrol. These males pulled their pistols first and disarmed the police officers. One was shot and killed, the other ran off to escape in the dark night and survived. The police began a search for the suspects. The police stopped a car that matched a stolen car. The driver, Gregory Powell, admitted to the crime but blamed the killing on his partner Jimmy Lee Smith. [Did the theft and confession mean he wanted to be caught?] Jimmy said ""I'm just a thief, not a murderer"". The surviving police officer Karl Hettinger said it was too dark to see who did the shooting.

The Captain tells the policemen that anyone who gives up his gun will be fired. One policeman told what he would do in a similar situation. [Believable? Or just for drama?] There is a trial. The parents of the accused testify. [How accurate was this?] Both are convicted of murder and sent to San Quentin to await execution. Karl has nightmares. ""Its just nerves""? Karl is stressed, some blame him for giving up his gun. [What was his background?] Karl has neck pains and headaches. He is assigned to guard a department store to watch for pickpockets and thieves. Does Karl's actions show a wish to be punished?

One prisoner tells of a Supreme Court decision that can save their lives. [Does that shower scene suggest something about Greg and Jimmy?] ""I want to be your friend."" There are motions for new trials for Powell and Smith. Do new lawyers create a delay? One lawyer is stressed by this procedure. Karl has chronic headaches. A crying baby adds to his stress. Karl testifies in the many trials. The end result is to reduce their sentences to life imprisonment. [Is this all a way to provide full employment for the legal profession? Eliminating the death penalty avoids these extra trials.] Karl now works as a gardener and landscaper in his own business. Should he take another job as a supervisor of gardeners near Bakersfield? [Karl's wife is a perfect angel.] The movie ends by showing a Highland Games Festival. [Was there some significance to this?]",1383782400,,2841,4.710261569416499

1239596,4,B00000JZIJ,"If you liked Jon Savage in ""Maria's Lovers,"" or James Woods in ""Once Upon a Time in America,""  you'll definitely want to have a look at ""The Onion Field."" These two can channel tortured soul and quirky perversity like nobody's business.

Technically, I probably should not offer a critique having seen it only once. As Robert Altmann said, at the initial viewing you're in 'who-dun-it mode;' only a second look puts you in a position to appreciate how the parts fit into the whole. But since I'm recommending the film I'll allow myself this breach of etiquette.

 ""The Onion Field"" begins promisingly enough, with James Woods' riveting creepiness and the strong performances of all involved, and it remains highly watchable through the murder. But it falls apart in the court-room scenes, which, oddly enough for a true story, strain credulity. They feel like an epilogue rather than the third act of the story. (So much for reality.) This is the dilemma of all court-room dramas and few are the directors who successfully avoid a slackening of tension. Granted, ""The Onion Field"" is not a thriller; its suspense arises organically out of key scenes and is not mined to keep us on the edge of our seats. It is not a manipulative film in that sense. Still, a film needs to have pulse and continuity, whether through character development or emplotment.

What keeps the film from greatness is its literalism, the true-to-actual-events quality its writer (Joseph Wambaugh) and director (Harold Becker) prided themselves on. The straight-forward, non-elliptical narration of the murder of a policeman is purely functional. And to be fair, Becker's classical approach works for the most part. So if you like your storytelling straight as a made-for-television movie, you won't be disappointed. That's a wholly legitimate approach and can be at least as effective as the splintering, hand-held and non-linear techniques that have recently crossed-over from the art film into mainstream cinema.

Becker and Wambaugh are more interested in being true to the story than in the post-production editing and scoring process necessary to make a film--and not just a story--compelling. A less by-the-numbers score might have helped. And a little stylistic panache could have glossed over the plot's failure to twist and spike. The problem with true to life stories is that they tend to fizzle out in the post-dramatic lives of their protagonists.

Rather than going deeper into James Woods' character, we're diverted into the lives of tangential ones. I see that as the main miscalculation. By trying to cover all who were impacted by the murder the film leads us down a series of (empathic) dead-ends. We are given no motivation to be invested in the lives of the bereaved, who's only dramatic function (and dimension) is to indicate traumatic loss. Atom Egoyan was able to make a mesmerizing film about the collective implication of a catastrophe (""The Sweet Hereafter""), but Becker is not artist enough to pull that off. Instead of sweep and poetry, we get a series episodes that declare: ""this also happened.""

So why acquire this DVD? Because it has a superior transfer--even on my HD laptop screen (somewhat of a surprise considering it's an MGM release); because it boasts strong performances by great actors, and because it's filmed with the classical restraint (no hand-held mannerisms) that invites repeat viewings. Finally, because it's a good (and well-behaved) film, which is saying something.",1254441600,4,3492,5.124780316344464

1239601,5,B00000JZIJ,"I've never read a book from Joseph Wambaugh, the ex-cop turned author who wrote the source material for this movie, but I sort of feel like diving into his works after seeing how great this cinematic translation of a true event worked out. ""The Onion Field"" the movie went on receive good reviews. I think the success of the film comes from the fact that Wambaugh retained complete control over every aspect of the film's production. According to an extra on the DVD, director Harold Becker, Wambaugh himself, and some of the author's friends put up the money to make the movie. That's a smart move if you can swing it. Keeping the Hollywood suits out of the filmmaking process cuts down significantly on pesky interruptions and annoying demands for all sorts of post-production changes. A typical studio might well have turned ""The Onion Field"" into a different creature entirely, and we the audience would be all the poorer for it. This is a masterful movie, a film that examines the heinousness of murder, the myriad failings of the criminal justice system, and the psychological problems that everyone involved in such a gruesome crime experiences afterwards.

""The Onion Field"" introduces us to two Los Angeles cops, Ian Campbell (Ted Danson) and Karl Hettinger (John Savage). The two have just become partners, and they couldn't be more unalike. Campbell loves playing bagpipes and is a friendly, talkative sort of fellow. Hettinger is quiet and somewhat awkward. We get the feeling they'll make a good team out on the road, though. Then the movie introduces us to a couple of pathetic losers, ex-cons Gregory Powell (James Woods) and Jimmy Smith (Franklyn Seales). The two men know each other because they spent time together in the same prison, and it's fairly obvious they have a weird psychological relationship with one another. Powell is a mouthy jerk, a big talker whose stint behind bars proves he isn't as big a fish as he thinks he is. Smith is quieter, but he's a follower that needs the attention Powell provides. The two plan to rob a liquor store as a way of starting their crime spree. Unfortunately, Campbell and Hettinger end up pulling the two men over on the pretext of a minor traffic infraction. The resulting stop leads to a series of events that find Powell and Smith taking the two cops hostage.

Here's where the title of the film comes in. Out in the sticks, out where the onion fields lay, the two criminals viciously gun down Ian Campbell. Hettinger, who willingly turned his gun over to the criminals, manages to escape the two and find help. At this point, the movie turns to a brutal examination of the American justice system and the psychological helplessness Hettinger feels over the death of his partner. Powell and Smith, quickly apprehended by the authorities, stand trial for capital murder. The courtroom quickly devolves into histrionics. Powell and Smith each claim the other killed Campbell, argue with the court over their representation, and thus drag out their trial and subsequent appeals for years. At one point, Powell even represents himself. Meanwhile, Hettinger feels the scorn of his fellow officers over the fact that he turned his gun over. Unable to deal with the guilt of living when Campbell died, he begins acting out in strange ways that cause him even more grief. ""The Onion Field"" follows both of these stories as the years melt away, as the specifics of the crime dissolve into endless hearings and heartrending grief. Becker and Wambaugh made a devastatingly powerful film, and one that holds up with repeated viewings.

I have no complaints with the film. None. Not a scrap of celluloid goes to waste here. The only problem I have with reviewing ""The Onion Field"" is picking out my favorite scenes. I liked the banter between Campbell and Hettinger at the beginning of the film. I liked the complex portrayals of Powell and Smith. I liked the depiction of the heinous crime. I liked everything that followed. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't focus in on several amazing scenes, the most amazing of which involves John Savage's character. An excellent actor too often relegated to b-movie schlock, his performance here is worthy of an Oscar. You can FEEL his guilt like it's a palpable force. The scene where he considers taking his own life simply blew me away. How he hits rock bottom and then comes to live with his guilt is both believable and marvelously rendered. I'd also like to say a few words about James Woods. He's a favorite actor of mine, and this movie only confirmed my opinions about him. He depicts Powell's over the top character without making it hammy--an ability he still summons at will today. The part where he puts his mother on the witness stand and proceeds to question her should be shown at acting schools across the country. It's that good.

The DVD version of ""The Onion Field"" contains two significant supplements. The first is a commentary track from director Harold Becker, the second a short featurette containing interviews with Ted Danson, John Savage, Joseph Wambaugh, James Woods. Both supplements add significant details to the film, so you should definitely give both of them a spin after watching the movie. At this point, let me give you a final reason why you should pick up ""The Onion Field"". In a time when Hollywood essentially made movies that gave cops the middle finger, this movie shows us in detail the agony a police officer goes through after a tragic, on the job incident. We often hear the criminal's side of the story (far too often, in my opinion) and maybe some stuff about the victim's family, but we never see what happens to the law enforcement officers. There's one more reason you should watch the movie. Now get out there and see it!",1179100800,10,5774,4.817540322580645
1239602,5,B00000JZIJ,"Released in 1979, The Onion Field never seems dated, (apart from seeing a VW bug swerve to avoid a Corvair).  It moves with cold, clear-eyed deliberation, fueled by great writing, acting, and directing.  Ex-cop Joseph Wambaugh, who wrote the book and screenplay, had been burned by the Hollywood studio system's adaptation of The Choirboys.  Wisely, he and director Harold Becker funded much of The Onion Field themselves in exchange for total creative control.  The result is a rich, textured masterpiece that looks far beneath the flash at the end of a barrel.  From cop to criminal to collateral damage, the people in this film are so real you might easily pass them on the street.

Today's batch of filmmakers would be well served to revisit The Onion Field.  One person is shot in this movie, that is the sum total of on-screen violence.  Despite this, there is a tension and dread pervading every frame arising from the many levels of cruelty and injustice; it is simply impossible to turn away.  Slaughtering one hundred cartoon characters with a sword registers zero on the emotional Richter scale, (it's a cheap device for a lazy and unimaginative slacker), but when one person dies and we care desperately, not just for him, but for those touched by the loss, now you are in the realm of art.

Gregory Ulas Powell, one of the most unsettling bad guys in all cinema, is the prototypical James Woods role.  This is his masterpiece performance; in some ways it doomed him to a life of playing psychos and maniacs.  (On the other hand, he never had much of a shot at those Robert Redford, Paul Newman parts.)  Woods deserved an Oscar; he is simply perfect as the creepy but complex Powell, a sociopath who is brilliant, insane, manipulative, profoundly needy, naive, and incredibly stupid all at once.  Powell's ability to corrupt and jigger the judicial system powers the back end of this film, and it is here that the unfairness and destruction become intolerable.  Where a million lesser movies end with the steel door closing on the perp, The Onion Field takes us into the painful machinations of briefs and appeals that defer punishment so richly deserved.  The toll is harrowing.

Detective Karl Francis Hettinger is the most visible casualty.  He feels responsible for the death of his partner and spirals downward, almost to the point of suicide.  There is one scene involving him and his infant daughter that is far more painful to watch than the killing.  John Savage is faultless in this role, bringing a subtle process of emotional decomposition to the screen that is a testament both to him, and to Wambaugh's writing.  In essence, the murder is a pebble in the water with ripples spreading far and wide.  Jimmy Smith, who has the misfortune of being recruited by Powell, is brought to life by Franklyn Seales.  Never has there been a more sympathetic crook, in Smith we see how some men do not choose evil but are simply too weak to resist the current.

The Onion Field is a masterwork on every level; it belongs in your collection.",1156118400,4,3052,4.780534351145038
1239603,5,B00000JZIJ,"Based on the true crime story of the same title written by Joseph Wambaugh, this 1979 movie is really well done. It stars James Woods (""Ghosts of Mississippi"") as a cold-blooded cop killer, a very young Ted Danson (a household word because of ""Cheers"") as the police office he brutally kills, and John Savage (""The Godfather Part III"") as the survivng officer who is riddled with guilt to the point that he engages in petty theft in order to be punished and ultimately is fired from the LA Police Department.

While all the actors give fine performances, James Woods is outstanding as a manipulative killer. The title of the movie comes from a field of onions where the killers take the two police officers after they abduct them.

I never saw this film when it was first released. With all the publicity recently about the Clutter murders in Kansas because of the movie ""Capote,"" perhaps ""The Onion Field"" will experience a much deserved revival.",1133654400,2,947,4.7682926829268295

Both roles were played rather well by John Savage who was nearing the end of his career, and Ted Danson before he became the bartender at Cheers.

The chilling contrast between Savage's fragile cop and James Woods' disturbing killer is highly intriguing. But most importantly, ""The Onion Field"" is a film that gives big screen cop figures a human, emotional quality, all filtered here by the high calliber acting and well written script.",1070064000,7,778,5.133858267716535
1239610,4,B00000JZIJ,"Those are the bone-chilling words spoken by kidnapper and soon-to-be killer Gregory Powell (brilliantly portrayed by James Woods) just seconds before fatally shooting Sgt. Ian Campbell (sensitively portrayed by a pre-""Cheers"" Ted Danson) near an abandoned onion field in the disturbing, psychologically intense film THE ONION FIELD (1979).  This film, directed in an appropriate brooding, deliberate style by Harold Becker, recounts the events that took place on March 2, 1963, as well as the aftermath of subsequent trials that took their mental toll on Sgt. Karl Hettinger (brilliantly portrayed by the underrated Method actor John Savage).
Brilliant police novelist Joseph Wambaugh, whose earlier work ""The Choirboys"" became warped in the screenplay adaptation process and, as a result, got turned into an occasionally funny but ultimately unsatisfying movie in 1977 (in which James Woods, not coincidentally, had appeared), made sure this time that he had complete control over the screenplay for THE ONION FIELD. In doing so, the film version remains faithful to the events described in the book, as it recounts the slow build-up to the terrible crime in parallel scenes; one showing the criminals, and the other showing the police officers before their fateful meeting. It also shows the slow psychological breakdown that is suffered afterwards by the surviving officer, who is tortured by a seemingly endless cycle of trials as well as the derision of his police superiors who felt that he could have done more to prevent the tragedy.
The only major fault that I find in the film is its irregular chronology of the aftermath; it provides no dates for each scene, which is bad because a scene that takes place days after the previous one will be followed by a sudden jump of ten or more years into the future.  This gets confusing to the viewer, who will suddenly--an unexpectantly--find a longhaired 1970's Gregory Powell spouting out prison law to a fellow inmate following a scene where the crewcut '60's Powell is defending himself in court. Also, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that (temporarily) outlawed capital punishment, thereby instantly commuting Powell and Jimmy Smith's death sentences to that of life imprisonment, is barely even mentioned, despite its obvious significance. Nevertheless, THE ONION FIELD is a compelling, and faithful, dramatization of one of the most shocking murder cases of the 1960's. It is just another small piece of American history, and is recommended for anyone who wants more insight into the development of our modern legal and law enforcement systems. Of course, I also recommend it for everyone who considers themselves to be film buffs. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1016496000,60,2717,5.287037037037037
