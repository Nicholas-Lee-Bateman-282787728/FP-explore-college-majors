8157172,5,B000KJ3NJ6,"This is a great VHS tape for people interested in the 1964 New York Worl'd Fair.

The first part is the weakest, it's in black and white and is made up mostly of artists renderings of what the Fair pavillions were to look like, since the film was produced before the fair opened. By the same token, it does have footage of some of the structures being built which is a plus. It is pompously narrated by Lowell Thomas, whose droning on gets a little hard to take after a while.

The second half of the tape is well worth the purchase price. As far as I know this tape is the only complete source of the film ""To The Fair"" in its original color form. The transfer is fine, (the color is good and so is the sound) and the scenes depicted are terriffic. In fact most of this film was used to make up the bulk of the visuals for the Conn. Public TV /DVD documentary ""The 1964 New York World's Fair"". In some ways this film is better than the documentary for what it doesn't include.

Beware: there are DVD's being offered for sale that also include ""To The Fair"" but they are in black and white which really takes away from the enjoyment of the film. ""To The Fair"" (B/W version) and the other videos on these DVD's are available for free download from the Internet Movie Archives/ Prelinger Collection. Don't waste your money on those DVD's, buy this VHS tape instead or get the Conn. TV documentary DVD.",1188432000,,1399,4.311787072243346
