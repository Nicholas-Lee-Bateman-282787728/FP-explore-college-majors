8195337,5,B0000TG9WE,"This DVD is the story of the Titanic at its most basic.  Much of the information is known to any serious Titanic student.  I give this DVD 5 stars mainly out of nostalgia.  I remember being a very young child and my parents buying this for me, and I would watch it on a loop everyday. I had the VHS version as DVDs didn't exist back then.  I still love it and its one of my favourite documentaries and DVDs.  I also like the music and the narration.  However, keep in mind that its probably a DVD for those with a casual, or new found interest in Titanic, as some of the information is either outdated or too basic.  However, I still love it!",1315008000,2,642,4.129032258064516
