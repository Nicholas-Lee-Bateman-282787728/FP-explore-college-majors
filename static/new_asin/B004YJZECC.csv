Genre: 6 Movie: 4.5

What's it about?
A couple love their new house, bought for a steal out of a foreclosure. During their first visit they find illegal drugs stashed in the walls, and they realize this is not their dream house. As they are about to leave, suddenly their exit is blocked by a gun-wielding neighbor Spector and his accomplice.

What did I think?
It was pretty good.  You got Dolph Lundgren and Sean Faris, so don't expect an oscar worthy performance.  For what it was, it was entertaining enough to rent but not to buy.  It's like going out to dinner and you come out satisfied.  The food was forgetable, but you weren't hungry when you left.  It's the Applebee's of thrillers.  I give ""Stash House"" a small, bullet-sized RENT IT.",1345507200,2,870,4.620915032679738
4499855,3,B004YJZECC,"The problem with most contemporary movies is the question of credibility.  Most action epics constitute theme park thrill rides with outlandish stunts that cost mega bucks not only to stage but also to enhance with dazzling CGI effects.  Hollywood always tries to scale down their budgets but rarely their believability when it comes to action pictures.  Venezuela-born director Eduardo Rodriguez and freshman scenarist Gary Spinelli strive for credibility in ""Stash House,"" co-starring Dolph Lundgren and Briana Evigan. The chronological narrative takes place during the course of a day and night in a way that preserves the unities of time, place, and setting. This well-made but often nondescript melodrama weds three genres: the surveillance camera saga, house pictures, and the narcotics thriller.  Lots of movies are now depicting their narratives from the perspective of surveillance cameras, like the ""Paranormal Activity"" flicks. We've also had a rash of movies about haunted houses. Usually, these movies concern houses that are either inhabited by supernatural adversaries as well as a setting for evil things. Since Don Siegel's 1958 melodrama ""The Line Up,"" Hollywood has used the plot about the innocent people who learn than drug dealers have hidden their illicit narcotics in their belongings, since as the Audrey Hepburn movie ""Wait Until Dark.""

A young married couple lands the real estate deal of a lifetime until they realize to their horror that the sumptuous house that they now own is a hiding place for heroin supplies and a prison for a California drug enforcement czar.  No sooner do our cute couple discover hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of heroin than they encounter two ruthless adversaries that lay siege to their house. One of the cartel gunmen is Dolph Lundgren and he isn't happy about the circumstances.  ""Stash House"" isn't bad and the husband and wife twosome are appropriately sympathetic, while Dolph plays a murderous villain who occasionally comes to their aid.  Pretty Briana Evigan of ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" plays a veterinarian.  Despite the apparent claustrophobic setting, ""Stash House"" emerges as rather nimble, particularly the ending when the villainous Dolph masquerades as our heroine's father.
Clearly, ""Stash House"" couldn't have cost too much after they paid off Dolph and Briana. The action takes place in two settings, an animal clinic and the house were the drugs are stashed.  The villain thinks of a cool way to bluff himself out of the house swarming with police for a finale that is provocative. Neither as visually flamboyant or nor as free-wheeling as Rodriguez's later shoot'em up ""El Gringo,"" ""Stash House"" is better than average and doesn't wear out its welcome.",1343433600,,2738,5.259174311926605
4499856,2,B004YJZECC,"""I bet somebody $20 that you wouldn't find that stash tonight. I guess I lost."" Dave (Faris) & Emma (Evigan) have found the perfect house in a great neighborhood with great neighbors. While on their first night there they discover a hidden closet filled with heroin. Thinking the best option is to leave and call the cops they walk outside and their neighbor tells them that that is a bad idea. Running back into the house they have no option but to toss out the stash to the people waiting for them, but that is not all they were looking for. So going into this I had low expectations because of the fact that this is a Lundgren movie. In my opinion he peaked in Rocky. This is another mindless action movie that is good enough to keep you watching but still a movie you forget as you are watching. If you are a fan of Lundgren you will like this movie. If you aren't I have to say I have seen worse from him. Overall, everything that a typical Lundgren usually has. Lame plot, acting and a movie that you forget as you watch. I give it a C-.",1341273600,2,1043,4.22
4499857,2,B004YJZECC,"Amy Nash (Briana Evigan) works at the St. Martin Animal House, but not in the part that has animals with cancer or mange, but the wing that only has cute Hollywood bunnies and kitties. Her husband David (Sean Faris) has just bought them a beautiful home. The electricity is not turned on except for the security system, outdoor lights, basement lights, and electronic doors and walls...they all seem to have their own power supply. Like Ed Wood would say, ""Who will notice?"" To make the evening more romantic they leave their cell phones in the car!!!!!

The film digresses into a combination home abduction/ ""Home Alone"" film. It turns out the house has drugs stashed in it and the owners want it back...but it is not that simple. They also want the witnesses dead and there is something else in the house they want...but what? And how does this tie into the opening scene where a Colombian scatters his gray matter all over the inside of a confessional? Dolph Lundgren and Jon Huertas play the bad guys.

Most of the film is a cat and mouse game being played between the two sides with David being the punching bag for any stray bullet. The dialouge was boring and having Dolph recite lines that are already the pits, doesn't raise the ""thriller"" level. At one point David, learning over a dead body shouts at Dolph, ""C'mon man!"" That was my MST moment which highlighted the poor writing of this thriller. The overall plot idea was decent, the execution is not gripping. This would be the third feature at the drive-in.

No-f-bombs that I recall, no nudity, brief ""Natalie Portman"" style sex scene (bra stays on). C'mon man!",1337385600,3,1626,4.678321678321678
4499858,1,B004YJZECC,"15 minutes was enough.  Useless, crass Yanks.  Throwaway ""Hey, guys"" drivel.  Ham acting.  Contemptible sex scenes.  Predictable, dross muzak.  Bye, bye...",1411344000,,155,6.142857142857143

4499860,1,B004YJZECC,"I just wasted 105 minutes for the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not too picky on films and like many that have bad reviews but this was so ridiculous that I just had to waste another minute to write this review to let people know that this is a total waste of time! I normally like Dolph but when you have ""9 year olds"" writing, directing, and producing a movie there is only so much he can do.....",1395878400,,402,4.0375
4499861,5,B004YJZECC,"Loved the opening, and the film had plenty of twists and turns to keep it suspenseful the entire time. Lots of unexpected moments made it a very worthwhile movie to curl up on the couch and watch.",1389225600,,196,4.324324324324325
4499862,5,B004YJZECC,"I found his latest movie to be one of his best.  The story line begins kinda slow, then steady builds up in suspense.  I found his character to be a mixture of human traits.  One one hand he wants to kill our heroes, but also wants to get it over so he can go home and be with his wife and kids. I would not like to have him as my neighbor.",1380326400,,340,3.6944444444444446
4499863,1,B004YJZECC,The acting and writing is so poor that you actually want to see the good guys get the hell beat out of them because the plot is so predictable and poorly acted. Don't buy it even if they wanna pay YOU to watch it !!  It's THAT bad !!,1374537600,,233,3.7551020408163267
4499864,5,B004YJZECC,I'm a fan of Sean Faris & Dolph Lundgren. Throwing them as opposites in this film worked out perfectly. I liked this movie.,1374364800,,123,4.391304347826087

4499866,5,B004YJZECC,"I loved this movie it reminded me of that movie Panic Room With Jodie foster
and the girl from twilight.
had a rial twist to it.
I wood definitely buy this movie and watch it again:)",1362787200,,182,4.083333333333333
4499867,3,B004YJZECC,"Dolph Lundgren is such a versatile actor that he can do both a good guy and bad guy equally well and in this movie he is very good at being the bad guy. The title of the movie tells you exactly what the plot is about, it's what it doesn't tell you that gets interesting because the stash is not what you would expect. When a young couple buy a foreclosed house once owned by a drug lord they don't expect killers to come looking for the STASH. Dolph is the professional hired by an unknown drug cartel and his partner is a bumbling baffoon for most of the movie thanks in part to the house having a great security system. Lundgren is just plain tired of all the killing he does and intends this to be the last one before he goes off to enjoy the good life with his wife and child. But he is determined to finish the job he was hired to do. And when you have the terminator after you, all you can do is run and HOPE you can get away. He makes a great bad guy!",1355616000,,958,3.9689119170984455
8448430,4,B004YJZECC,Nice film. Some cinematography issues concerning logistics. I really enjoyed the tension and was able to pull some critical analysis from it.
