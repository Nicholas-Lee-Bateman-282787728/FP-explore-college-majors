8229022,4,B000XPXU2W,"At only about five minutes long (not counting beginning and end credits), ""Visions"" does not waste time getting to the point. Cassandra Oyola (played by Mennette Coln) is a ""police psychic"" who sees her psychiatrist (Matt Milano) to try to help draw out her visions of a serial killer. The film begins with Oyola on the couch describing her visions, and we see them, too, as each of three victims is killed.

""Visions"" was made in 2005 as part of The 48 Hour Film Project, a competition in which filmmakers are allowed only 48 hours (surprise) to complete a film. That time includes the script, the rehearsal, the set design, the actual shooting of the film, and the editing and sound. Filmmakers are given specific elements that must appear in the film. According to the Web site for the project (from which I take all this information), those elements can include a specific character or a line of dialog.

In light of this background, ""Visions"" is a fairly effective film. There are some obvious problems--such as the cop's office that looks like a desk in any home den--, but for the most part, the film comes together nicely. Coln does not look much like a police officer in bearing, dress, or age, but her role is more concerned with her putative psychic ability than her employment status, and the plot itself does not truly hinge on her being a cop.

If nothing else, ""Visions"" serves as an excellent subject for people interested in seeing what talented filmmakers can do with virtually no budget and virtually no time. As a short film, this one succeeds, especially given those constraints.",1197158400,,1600,4.748201438848921
