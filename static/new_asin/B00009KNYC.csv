Torrie, Chicago street fight Victoria v.s. Trish. Also torrie and dawn's hotel room footage, stacy as the statue of liberty and a thing where ivory shows a camera man how to use a whip. The last is lovely lita at an animal shelter to show you the job she did when she was hurt shes not in the movie though. I think litas was the the best, most heart thoughing and funny part on the extras but all and all the movie and extras are awsome. i hope this is helpful!? I wish chyna (joanie Laurer) was in the movie im here biggest fan.",1052611200,9,985,4.570621468926554

All the WWE Divas are here: Torrie Wilson, Trish Stratus, Stacy Keibler, Ivory, Jazz, Dawn Marie, Molly, Terri, Victoria, Jacqueline & Nidia. The Divas brave the Western desert and strip down to this side of naked for fun and adventure. Join the Divas as they go four-wheeling, do some river rafting, visit a ghost town & a film studio.

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie Plus more Awsome Diva's Matches.
And Also the hot divas in Bikini's or not wearing much at all. But it Has to be One of The Best WWE DVD'S of 2003! And The Best Divas Dvd Next To WWE(F) Diva's Tropical Pleasure. A+",1089417600,2,424,4.3125

I recently bought this DVD, I am a huge Wrestling fan, the only reason I got it was because it featured really HOT Divas in it.
The DVD is well packaged, with plenty of extras, such as matches (most of these matches are Bikini ones, not that I am complaining, but it gets alittle boring and predictable thru out).
The Pros- SIZZLING WWE Divas in REALLY TINY BIKINIS
The Cons- Gets abit boring (I watched this DVD about 4 times, and I have not watched it since), Also
the start of the DVD has a WWE 'Don't Try This At Home'Commercial
-You have to watch this, you can't fast forward or skip it.
Also, It wouldn't Kill Them (DVD Company) To Sharpen The Picture, As It Is Abit Grainy, As With All WWE DVDs.
Overall- Save Your Money And Buy the New
WWE DIVAS-SOUTH OF THE BOARDER DVD, As it is much better than this one.",1087948800,3,903,4.195402298850575
