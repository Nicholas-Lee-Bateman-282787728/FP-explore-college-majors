4332906,5,B004DMIISC,I have mixed feelings about this movie set. If you have seen the series then 2 of the movies are more or less a short summary of events in the series. The Curse of the Blood Rubies and Sleeping Princess in Devils Castle are new tales that are not covered in the Dragonball series. It's really just 2 useful movies. It is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound and the video quality is very good. If you like Dragonball this set is a good buy.,1351123200,3,449,4.232558139534884
4332907,5,B004DMIISC,"Great Product at a very good Price.  The voice actors are the originals, as in the movies were not re-recorded with Funimation's current DBZ crew as the Dragon Ball series DVD release was.

You do not need to be fluent or even that familiar with the series in order to watch and thoroughly enjoy this Collection... Each movie introduces the characters and situations very well, in fact there are many scenes that are nearly direct copies from the series as far as the introductions go.

You could basically look at these 4 movies as a summation of the entire series of Dragon Ball up until the Piccalo/Picc Jr sagas. So if you are a DBZ fan, but never watched Dragon Ball and want to know how everybody met and the origins of the characters but don't want to put in 150+ episodes to do so, this 4-Movie Set is the perfect replacement to pretty much sum-up what is ""Dragon Ball"" if that makes sense.",1329609600,,898,4.463414634146342
4332908,5,B004DMIISC,The beginning story movies they leave out of original and make no mention of in series. Still very good and entertaining.,1323302400,,121,4.809523809523809
4332909,5,B004DMIISC,"Every movie is displayed perfectly in 4:3. Although I personally don't like the movies as much as the DBZ movies, this is a must for any true fan of the series. I would watch the whole Dragon Ball series first before watching this because the movies contain spoilers. Its hard to explain but you'll understand once you watch these movies. All in all the movie pack is great and is sold at a good price. I've heard people complain about the second movie having problems but I personally didn't see the problem. I thought every movie was pristine in quality. Happy watching!",1318896000,,572,4.617647058823529
4332910,3,B004DMIISC,"This four-disc set includes Curse of the Blood Rubies, Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle, Mystical Adventure, and The Path to Power.  Each disc is packaged in an individual slimline box, and the four slimline boxes are in a cardboard slipcover.

Each film is included on a separate disc.  At first, this may seem impressive, but when you realize that most of films aren't even an hour long (the first three run for about 50 minutes, while the fourth has a runtime of 80 minutes), it feels like a waste.  This really could have been condensed down to a two-disc set.  This is especially true when you realize that the disc for Curse of the Blood Rubies only has trailers on it, and the remaining three discs contain absolutely no special features at all.  Also, it should be noted that the disc for Curse of the Blood Rubies that's included in this set is exactly the same as the version that was released individually.

One of the things that FUNimation plays up with this set is the fact that the films have been remastered.  However, when I watched all of the discs on this set, I noticed that the video looked rather grainy, and that the audio sounded rather muffled.  If this is how it looks in a remastered version, I would hate to see how it would look and sound if it wasn't remastered.

As for the films themselves, Curse of the Blood Rubies is a retelling of the first thirteen episodes of Dragon Ball, Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle is a retelling of how Goku and Kuririn become Master Roshi's students, Mystical Adventure is a retelling of the second Tenkaichi Tournament, and The Path to Power is a retelling of the first two seasons of Dragon Ball.  The first three films were produced and released concurrently with the original Dragon Ball series, while the fourth was produced in 1996 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Dragon Ball franchise.  The first three films have to be seen as an ""alternate timeline"" story for the original Dragon Ball anime series, while the fourth film needs to be seen as an ""alternate timeline"" story for both the anime series and the first three Dragon Ball films.

Personally, I can only truly recommend this box set for the die-hard Dragon Ball fans that must own everything on DVD, and want to purchase this set as an easy way to acquire all four Dragon Ball films for their collection.

I wrote this review after giving a copy of the Dragon Ball 4-Movie DVD Box Set as a gift to my husband.",1318896000,3,2454,4.573059360730594
4332911,2,B004DMIISC,"This set contains all four theatrical Dragon Ball films 'Curse Of The Blood Rubies' (The Legend Of Shen Long/Shenron), 'Sleeping Princess In Devil's Castle', 'Mystical Adventure', and 'The Path To Power'. Unlike some of the previous releases, this set is the uncut version and is rated TV-14 due to strong sex references and some violence.
Although FUNimation misleadingly marketing this box set as ""four feature length movies"" only the last film, at 80 minutes, is feature length; Movies 1-3 only have a runtime of 44-50 minutes and were released theatrically as triple or quadruple features with other anime movies. The first three movies are essentially a trilogy on their own, and the last film remakes the first few story arcs of the anime as a 10th anniversary celebration.
These films have their own continuity, so no prior knowledge of the series is needed and these movies serve as a great introduction to the series; although if you've already watched some of the series you'll want to wait until the end of season three to watch these to avoid spoilers.

The movies themselves (contains minor spoilers):
The series focuses around the titular Dragon Balls: seven magic balls that, if brought together, will summon a magic dragon who will grant you a single wish.

'Curse Of The Blood Rubies' (1986 - 50 minutes) contains an original storyline original plot, but remakes the sub plot from the series of the characters meeting for the first time (some scenes are almost word for word the same).
Goku is a small boy who lives on his own in the woods and has never seen another human before except his late grandfather and is a master of martial arts. When he meets Bulma, a teenage girl collecting the dragon balls to wish for a boyfriend, the two discover that Goku's dragon ball (a memento from his grampa) has been stolen and they decide to work together to retrieve the dragon ball. They then meet Pansy, who explains that the dragon ball was stolen by King Gurumes' henchmen so that he can wish away an unbearable hunger. In order to do this he is destroying Pansy's town to mine for Blood Rubies, a type of gem stone with an evil curse. The three search for legendary martial artist Muten Roshi in the hope that he will help them defeat the evil king, but on the way must face desert bandit Yamcha, shape-shifter Oolong, and the King's henchmen.
This film is a great introduction to the series, and manages to concisely remake the characters' introductions for new viewers, as well as adding a decent new villain for fans who are familiar with the series, and has a great pace for a short film. The olny problem with this film is that the climax is somewhat anticlimactic and the ending is quite sudden.

'The Sleeping Princess Of Devil's Castle' (1987 - 45 minutes) uses remakes of the opening and ending scenes from episode 14 as a framing device for an original plot.
Goku and his new rival Krillin (Kuririn) are competing to become Muten Roshi's student, but Roshi can only take on one pupil so he sets them a challenge. Whoever can retrieve the legendary sleeping princess of devil's castle will become Roshi's student. Soon after, Goku's friends arrive to see him and, after Roshi tells them that he is at a theme park, follow him to Devil's castle. Once they arrive, Bulma is kidnapped by the monster inhabitants of Devil's castle, and Goku and Krillin discover that a vampire named Lucifer, the castle's owner, plans to block out the sun so that the monsters can rule a new reign of darkness.
This film has a wonderful Gothic style that has a visual and thematic tangent that is rarely seen in the series without diverging from the kinds of characters and storylines that series is known for. This film has a much more defined climax, and gives fans of the series a new story that they are not already familiar with.

'Mystical Adventure' (1988 - 46 minutes) like the first movie remakes parts of the series in an original overall plot.
In the Mifan empire, evil minister Shen, general Tao, and tien shinhan (ten shinhan) are collecting the dragon ball and using the guise of finding the childish emperor Chiatzu's doll Ran Ran, that they themselves stole, to wish for Chiatzu to die and themselves to take over the country. While participating in the World Martial Arts Tournament held in Mifan, and also collecting the dragon balls to bring back something precious to one of their friends, Goku and Krillin get caught up in their sinister plan. Not only do Goku and Krillin plan on winning the tournament, but they also must defeat some of the the world's most powerful fighters to have their wish granted.
Although I loved this movie on the whole, two things bothered me: first, the pacing was far too fast; the tournament itself goes by really quickly, and the resolution is very rushed, the credits roll over an ending that is so sudden that we never even see the character's reactions to the conclusion of there adventure. Also, the Dr Slump crossover from the series, which is in my opinion by far the worse part of Dragon Ball, randomly happens during the climax that is very out of place and completely kills the action and drama. I felt that the original material was  better then the sections that were remade from the series, the emperor Chiatzu plot put a fantastically developed spin on the Tien/Chiatzu relationship; it's great to see some of the characters with alternate origins and backgrounds, and really develops the characters.

'The Path To Power' (1996 - 80 minutes) This film uses Dragon Ball GT's art and animation style as it' was made eight years after Dragon ball finished. This film entirely remakes parts of the series, and the characters meeting sub-plot form movie one is used again, giving the two very some almost identical scenes.
This film introduces us to Goku again in the same way that the first film did. However, this time it's the Red Ribbon Army that are collecting the dragon balls, who plan on using them to rule the world.
This film looks stands out as lot newer then the others on the set, and the one that  ""feels"" most like a movie due to its increased run time. This film does a great job of condensing the first seventy episodes into eighty minutes, and works as a completely stand alone film. The only problem is, like movie three, the ending is too sudden and rushed; the second that the final fight stops, the credits roll, leaving the audience wondering what exactly happened to each character after this one adventure was complete. Maybe the writers just assumed that anyone watching the movie would have seen the series and already know?

Presentation and Extras:
Each movie gets its own DVD in a slim DVD case. One the front we get a new cover following the Season set's template (in movie one's case the box art for the individual release, but new art for the other three), and on the back instead of a redundant synopsis there's the original theatrical poster; these boxes look fantastic, and it's great to have both pieces of artwork. This does however potentially mislead people into thinking they're getting more then is actually in the set, but so does most of the ""Four feature length films"" marketing.

The set contains the original Japanese version, and the uncut English dub. The dubs however, aren't consistent from one disc to another. Movie one's dub is from 2010 and used the DBZK cast in a fantastic dub, although annoyingly the script is mostly recycled from the 1995 edited dub. Movies 2 and 3 are some of FUNimation's earliest recorded dubs so the: script, casting, acting, and recoding quality is weak; some of the series' voices are the same but most aren't, and the ones that are sound a lot different due to these dubs being so long before the main series. Movie 4's dub was recorded just after the series, so the cast is the same, and the voices have been perfected after dubbing the characters for three years. This dub is far from perfect, but it's not bad and at least is consistent with the other Dragon Ball DVDs.

The video sporadically uses the English and Japanese Titles and credits, presumably depending on weather FUNimation has a clean version or not. Movie two uses its original Japanese title, Movies 1-2 use English credits, and visa versa for all the others; while this is perfectly adequate, FUNi could have added both versions using seamless branching as they apparently did for the previous set, making this something of a downgrade. There is also no English credits at all on the last two movies (i.e. there's no silent credit roll at the end like on other FUNi DVDs), meaning there is no credit for the English cast or crew.

Unfortunately there are no extras on this set except for some trailers for other FUNimation DVDs.

Video and Audio:
Unlike the DBZ movies, these films are in open matte 4:3, with more picture on the top and bottom then the theatrical release; in theory this means that the framing should be fine of the films are cropped for a 16:9 display.

These films were never going to look brand new being up to 25 years old, but the versions used here clearly hasn't had much 'remastering' done. Movies 1-3 are very grainy and scratches and dust appear frequently throughout, especially in the opening sequences. It doesn't distract from the overall viewing but you'd expect better from a DVD which is gleefully advertised as ""remastered."" Oddly, a few minutes early on in movie one seem to be in a lower resolution as well. Being from 1996, Movie four doesn't have these problems; the picture has very little grain and few scratches, dirt, and imperfections are seen.
The real problem, however, is the second disc. The whole movie has a halved frame rate, resulting in a very jumpy video where the viewer can almost distinguish between each individual frame. Most animation is only at 12fps, but the problem is really bad during pans or transitions. The movie isn't unwatchable, but this error is very distracting, especially during action scenes. This error is big enough to make me plan on buying the old DVD for a better quality video, and should never have been deemed good enough to pass any kind of quality control.

The audio for all four films is 5.1 English (a first for movies 3 and 4) and a measly 96KB/s mono Japanese (not stereo as the box says). The English tracks are probably as good as they can be and depend on the age of the dub, all the films except movie 2 sound perfectly clear, and movie 2 may simply not have high enough quality masters. Movies 1-3 in Japanese have an appalling sound transfer, it's muffled causing it to sound like the characters are talking into a pillow, and is also quite distorted. Movie 4 sounds good enough, but a film from 1996 must have a stereo mix, so why is this DVD in mono?

In Conclusion:
This set contains four great (albeit mostly short) theatrical movies that contain both well developed new storylines for fans, as well as being an effective introduction for new viewers of Dragon ball; although there are some pacing issues. The set is really nicely presented, albeit somewhat misleadingly.
However, the unbelievable video error on movie 2 (as well as this version only containing one version of the credits) makes this set a huge downgrade and I would recommend you buy the old DVDs instead (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Curse-of-the-Blood-Rubies-Movie-1/dp/B003H6KRKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies Movie #1</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Movie-3-pack/dp/B0010YSD3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Movie 3-pack</a>), unless you really want a 5.1 mix of the dubs of movies 3 and 4, or don't plan on watching movie 2.

Update: I've now purchased all three original releases for comparison (minus Blood Rubies, which is identical anyway). Movie 2's original release is, as I've said, undeniably better, with 24fps video, much clearer Japanese audio and 5.1 English audio (albeit with the 90s dub opening). Movie 3 has slightly worse video quality on the 3-pack release but better Japanese audio, and the English dub is stereo only. Movie 4 has considerably worse picture quality on the original release and only stereo sound for the dubbed version, but does have less muffled mono Japanese audio.
Therefore, movie 2 is undeniably better no matter which version you watch, movie 3's 4-pack version is superior for the English dub but you'll want the 3-pack if you plan to watch it in Japanese, and for movie 4 the 4-pack is better for the dub but you have to chose either better video or audio for the Japanese version. If you stick to the dubs and already have the individual 'Sleeping Princes' then this set is a good way to complete your collection, but it's a bit more complicated if you want the movies in Japanese!",1316822400,75,12869,4.8321234119782215
4332912,5,B004DMIISC,"When anyone looks back at music, movies, or TV Shows that define a generation - Dragon Ball/DBZ surely pops into anyones mind. Of course, this series made its way to US shores in the 1990's, but it sure is a memorable one that not many anime fans can never forget. The series which lasted on Japanese TV for ten years and spawned over four-hundred TV episodes, toys, countless movies, and merchandise, etc. is now once again available in DVD format with a collection of the Dragon Ball movies. This is the first time that the set will contain the 'Blood Rubies' movie, while previous releases didn't. It also contains the last DB movie released in 1996 to commemorate the shows ten years anniversary and success. That movie, 'The Path to Power' is basically the enture first season of the show condensed into a ninety minute movie that contains top-notch movie animation quality that runs way smoother and fluid than the series ever did. If you are already a fan and own all of these, i'd suggest you save a few bucks and skip it. However, if you are a must have die-hard DB fan than this is a worthy compliation to add to one's DB collection. If you are new to the series, this is a good set to start off on. Also check out the DB DVD box sets that are now available and have all 153 episodes of the series at very affordable prices. Watch the show that captivated the world, started a phenomenon and introduced the US to what Japanese anime really is.",1294617600,37,1453,4.466165413533835

Plus the Japanese audio for the first three movies -especially the third - is obviously non-remastered and really tinny.  The picture is decent though.  There are no real special features.

4332992,4,B004DMIISC,"I watched all of the movies in Japanese because I don't care for any of the English dubs of any of the Dragon Ball series except for Kai. I can see why some people might be upset about the different English voice actors used in the movies, but I really don't think it justifies a one-star rating. Having said that, I don't understand why Funimation wouldn't invest in re-dubbing all of them in order to keep things consistent with the first movie, Curse of the Blood Rubies.

The first three movies: Curse of the Blood Rubies, Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle, and Mystical Adventure are basically abridged rewrites of what happened in the series from the very beginning up until the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai. This makes the movies somewhat predictable, but it's fun to see everything play out in a different way. The fourth movie in this collection: Path to Power, is a blend of the Emperor Pilaf and Red Ribbon Army story arcs. This one was animated after Dragon Ball GT came out and thus has the best animation quality by far.

There are a couple of oddities with this release however, or at least the copy that I own. For one thing, the run time listed on the package says 160 minutes, which is way off. This really doesn't matter at all, but I thought it was really strange. The second thing is that Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle has weird issues with the video quality. It seems like frames are missing somehow and it leads to the animation looking much worse than the other two in the original trilogy. This issue with the second film is what drops this to a 4-star rating for me. Despite this issue with the second film though, I was able to enjoy it.",1421107200,,1666,4.513245033112582

I've been a fan for years and now I remember why I skipped these movies. They're terrible ""retelling"" of sagas.

They're so poorly written they recycled even some scenes or events that occurred in the original series.

No special features, s***ty flimsy box that the DVDs come in. This could of easily fit one disc, maybe two but they decided to give you 4 separate discs.

Wouldn't recommend to any fan. Go read the wiki on these episodes and you'll find they're just the same saga with s***ty plot twists or a swap out of a major villain.",1406851200,,608,4.5504587155963305

It's what happens throughout the entire Dragonball series, but pretty much abridged and some thing happen differently, but what's worse is that no ones voice is the same i'm pretty sure except Bulma and maybe master Roshi. Once i heard Goku's voice i was angered and almost immediately turned it off. I thought; what a waste of money.",1389225600,2,423,4.808219178082192
4333043,3,B004DMIISC,"If you're new to Dragon Ball, or have never watched the original TV series (the episodes that precede ""Dragon Ball Z""), you really ought to get caught up on that box set first.  Otherwise, you'll be a bit confused!  All four of these short movies are re-tellings or ""reboots"" of the first several anime' episodes.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; indeed, it's fun to see Chiaotzu re-cast as an emperor overseeing a very different Budokai Tenkaichi, and to watch what else *might* have happened when Goku met Master Roshi and company.  The best of the bunch is the fourth film, 1996's ""The Path to Power"", drawn in a style resembling the contemporary Dragon Ball GT, with slick direction and MUCH faster pacing than the original series.  Indeed, if there's a problem with these movies, it's that they try to tell the story a bit *too* quickly, which is why a thorough background knowledge of the classic series is a necessity.",1389052800,4,929,4.745341614906832

The movies are short, little stories that aren't fantastic additions to the series. My biggest concern is that 3 out of the 4 movies are dubbed with different voice actors than were used in the series. Other than that, which I did know going in, they are fun little flicks.
