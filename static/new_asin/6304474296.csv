3673716,2,6304474296,"DVD arrived in good time but as the movie is an American movie and some sections are in the Thai Language, it was impossible to follow as there were no subtitles in English for the Thai language sections.

Which means whole sections of the movie were unintelligible.",1266710400,2,266,4.659574468085107
3673717,4,6304474296,"The character of Thailand is represented well here and not just in the hedonistic way. The countryside and Buddha lifestyle get spliced into the film in such a way that nothing is too overplayed.

The story follows a reclusive American brother traveling to Thailand in hopes of recovering his wayward expat brother from a self-induced immersion into the Thai lifestyle. In short order we see the underexposed-to-life brother finding love, pleasure and indigenous beauty that both captivates him and wakes his soul. Some nice performances from all of these unknowns, with the usual solid showings from Burstyn and Sommer. The outcomes are believable and the infamous Thai pleasures are covered in a tasteful way.

The DVD is of decent quality with both 2.0 and 5.1 options, but the subtitles are a little frustrating. Anytime someone speaks Thai they did not translate so there are entire conversations where body language and scene placement are the only cues as to what they are saying. The supplement is an 11-minute making of that is all interviews - decent information. The commentary (as does a brief snippet in the docu) contains the good and bad of filming in Thailand. If anything, watching the Ellen Burstyn interview of her slamming Hollywood content of late is worth it in itself.

3.5 for the film and quality, .5 for the supplements.",1255824000,6,1346,5.0
3673718,4,6304474296,"Coming in under the radar in today's film industry is nothing new, but The Elephant King came in low and is going to strike hard.  Wonderful performances from a talented cast only scratches the surface.  The imagery and cinematography coupled with the honest story telling make for a must see film.  If there's going to be a stand out performance, Jonno Roberts as the conflicted Jake, delivers a powerhouse emotional roller coaster of ride that should not be missed.  Ellen Burstyn is at her amazing best and the beautiful Florence Faivre is both stunning and troubled and can not help but hold the viewer's heart in the palm of her hand.  Tate Ellington's Oliver meshes the whole story together seamlessly.  Writer-Director Seth Grossman has much to be proud of.  Even the use of Thailand as the back drop presents as stunning, haunting and frightening all at the same time.  Do not miss this movie.",1248739200,12,901,4.805194805194805
3673719,1,6304474296,"Now, I love NG - I really do - but this video is just a litany of all the horrible things we've ever done to elephants.  Really very little on elephant behavior and it just leaves you feeling horrible.",963705600,7,201,4.153846153846154

8316345,2,6304474296,"This movie is a waste of time. Has nothing to do with elephants. It gives a very stereotyped view of Thai people and their country. The acting is fair, but the story is poor.",1435968000,,174,4.147058823529412

8316348,4,6304474296,"An interesting film that shows how we grow in wisdom relative to the experiences we have (or not); and also how life's experiences can affect our outlook towards others culturally, and economically, different from us in the west.  I liked that the story did not have epiphanic moments but rather segued from one reality to the next - which is what life is, a concatenation of many aspects melding together and becoming life's experiences.  The main character, a sort of wuss, basically remains a wuss throughout the movie, but....well, you'll see if you watch this film.",1398556800,,570,4.927083333333333
8316349,2,6304474296,"The most interesting character in this movie, (the baby elephant) dies before the end.  Was it from suicide, shame, or boredom?

8316350,5,6304474296,"I bought this video back in the 90's. Obviously VHS's do not last especially when played repeatedly. I just purchased it again for the next generation. Wish it came on DVD. Content is real, sometimes disturbing, but definitely educational.",1364515200,,239,5.153846153846154
8316351,3,6304474296,"Sixteen year old Oliver has been sent by a family to bring back his brother Jack-a fugitive archeologist having spent a grant on a research of an ancient Thai civilization place having existed into his cash-grabbing phantasies only to rip funding for alike ones thrown on finding ""a man-made climate change"" traces. Of course, Jack has no intention to face a court back in New York but to entertain own lustful urges in that Asian kingdom where the US dollar buys much.

This story of deflowering a junior virgin brother by Jack on mother's handovers and miserable proceeds from kickboxing fights he steadily loses to a lady-boxer ex-lover of him tells of a Thai life, Americans abroad, brotherly love till a collapse into happy ending of a family reunion through tragic events.

I am not sure whether it is worth to watch this movie at all if not by some either loving the muscular bodies or baby-elephant starvation to the death by stupid young foreigners.",1299628800,,958,4.8
8316352,3,6304474296,"When I watch a movie set in Thailand, I like to see some of the beautiful country.  That was largely absent, most of the action taking place in the big city.  It's a movie about a nerd that visits his jerk brother, who is abusing his relationships with his family, his university employer, and everyone else that comes near him.  Using favorable exchange rates, he is able to let his self-centered tendencies blossom.
His brother visits, either to try to get the jerk to come home, or maybe just to cure his own blues.
I hoped to see a cinematic movie with a good story.  This is a story of a jerk and the awakening of his depressed brother.  The awakening is well-done, in that he wakes up to both good and bad elements of life.
As the other review said, the acting is good.  If that's the kind of story you like, you might try this one.  If you want to see something more pleasant, and more visually beautiful, then look elsewhere.",1280620800,,933,4.358381502890174
