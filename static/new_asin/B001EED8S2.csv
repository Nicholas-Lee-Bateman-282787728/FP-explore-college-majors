3552504,2,B001EED8S2,"Have had enough of the sorry, negative gay-themed movies!  Would like to see a positive gay-themed movie with a happy ending for once!  Seriously tired of these ""down-and-out"" story-lines!",1358380800,,188,5.448275862068965
3552505,3,B001EED8S2,it was OK but the story didn't seem to go anywhere.  The whole story line seemed purposeless and what was accomplished was mediocre at best,1356480000,,139,4.56
3552506,1,B001EED8S2,"The most deceiving trailer ever. The movie was the most pointless movie I had ever seen. Two friends, one gay n one straight, go on a road trip n pretty much argue the whole time. The straight guy has sex with one chick and the gay guy gets head by the other chick, they both go back home and the movie ends. WTF?!",1351987200,,314,4.0
3552507,1,B001EED8S2,The movie starts out with two friends. One is depressed all the time and the other is an obnoxious jerk. The depressed one decides to go on a road trip back to his hometown for whatever reason. The friend tags along. They meet up with two girls and they both end up treating them like garbage. And then they go home and the movie ends. The depressed guy is still depressed and the obnoxious guy is still obnoxious. I hated this movie,1279152000,10,433,4.2926829268292686
3552508,2,B001EED8S2,"This is a film with no real grounding. The plot is circular and lightweght. Of the two main characters, one is rather unpleasant, the other simply off-putting.  One is a psychological bully who successfully intimidates the other every chance he gets: the other guy is compulsively wimpy and feeds readily into the co-dependent shenanigans that comprise the whole movie. These two, by the way, have been ""friends"" for at least ten years or more.  This movie is watchable--but only just.",1270252800,4,485,5.05
3552509,3,B001EED8S2,"Best friends since high school, and now in their late 20's, Mark and Alex couldn't be more different, but they strangely seem to compliment each other, as if each was ""Half A Person"" (2007). Mark is gay, outgoing and charismatic, though the relationship with his boyfriend, Tom, is definitely in trouble due to Mark's immaturity and lack of responsibility.  Alex is straight, shy and chronically dateless, fairly conscientious and responsible, but feels that life is passing him by. It's Alex's idea to leave their small town to spend some time in Toronto, but Mark quickly invites himself along, leaving Tom behind.  Their road trip is a lot more eventful than Alex imagined (or wanted), thanks to Mark's impulsive actions along the way.  They meet two teenage girls on the bus, and later go out with them in Toronto, a move that both realized wasn't very smart, but actually helps each of the young men to realize what they want out of life. Alex also takes a side trip to someone he knew in his past, although this is not very clear in the film.

An ambitious indie film with a relatively simple premise and minimal story development, and the film's low budget is also somewhat evident in the production values, including background noise making dialogue difficult to hear in a few scenes. Would have liked the background of friendship between the gay/straight friends - explored very briefly in disjointed flashbacks - developed a lot more, and a clearer explanation of Alex's connection to Toronto. DVD only includes a few outtakes, which illustrate the rather casual style of the film's writer/director.  Film is not rated, would only be a soft R due to",1224720000,11,1659,4.868794326241135

3552542,2,B001EED8S2,Is there a sequel to this? The ending is probably the worst I've seen yet! The movie was great until the end thus receiving 2 stars.,1468195200,,132,4.115384615384615

3552569,1,B001EED8S2,This was a really confusing movie in the sense that the gay character seemed more straight than that straight character.  I confused about the relationship - They were really good friends but the one was gay and the one was not.  Sometimes I thought the straight boy had a thing for his gay buddy.  Just really confusing and not very well done.,1414108800,,344,4.516129032258065

3552571,1,B001EED8S2,I think I died watching it. So boring and slow. They never even finished the school flashbacks. The gay dude wasn't even gay but was bi or pan or something. Maybe the straight dude was gay. Idk whatever gender is fluid I guess. Maybe that's the takeaway theme of this poor excuse of a film? I'm confused now. Whatever. Don't watch this. haha,1403136000,2,341,4.428571428571429
3552572,5,B001EED8S2,This was worth the watch. I can't begin to express how good this movie was. I can't wait to see more in the future.,1397606400,,115,3.8333333333333335
3552573,1,B001EED8S2,Boring. Don't waste your time with this movie. Find another. Canada has another reason to be ashamed besides Justin bieber,1396051200,,122,5.15
3552574,1,B001EED8S2,Just couldn't get interested.  At this point i couldn't tell you what the movie was about.  Couln't sustain interest in it.,1394928000,2,123,4.809523809523809
3552575,1,B001EED8S2,The gay guy is retarded. The straight guy is a bottom waiting to happen. That's it. Not much of anything to storyline. Very infantile.,1393718400,2,134,4.625
3552576,1,B001EED8S2,It was so slow and I left in the middle. Could not get more frustrated with it.  enough is enough,1393545600,,97,3.85
3552577,2,B001EED8S2,Most of the elements were good but there was not much of a story line this film.  There was a back stories that were not fully expanded upon and left a hole the story telling and in defining the relationship between the two major characters' and the relationships they had with others. This is a non story.,1391558400,,306,4.368421052631579
3552578,2,B001EED8S2,The main character moped constantly but it was never clear why. He might have been in love with his friend but if that was so the story never developed.,1389657600,,152,4.275862068965517
3552579,2,B001EED8S2,"Only giving it more than one star because Michael Majeski is attractive. Worst movie ending ever, completely lacks depth overall, literally feels like half of a story and has no sense of completion whatsoever. Disappointing.",1386892800,,224,5.428571428571429
3552590,1,B001EED8S2,There is no story. No conflict resolution. I wouldn't even call a day in the life. Just a big waste of time.,1385769600,,108,3.9545454545454546
3552591,2,B001EED8S2,"I really kept waiting for this movie to go somewhere, ANYWHERE!  The relationship was weird to say the least.  Alex seemed like he had feelings for Mark that went beyond friendship and vise versa.  At one point in the hotel room it seems like maybe they were going to discuss this and then it just falls flat yet again.  And can someone please explain what the hell happened when they got locked in the school.  I get what the writer was going for by creating two characters that were opposite sides of a coin, but the story needed more build up, more backstory.  The ending was a joke, a bad joke on the viewer.  If I had to describe this film I one word it would be FRUSTRATING!!!!",1383091200,,683,4.2890625
3552592,1,B001EED8S2,all you need is half a brain to watch half a person.  I've heard better dialogue in a first grade classroom.  This video is extremely boring with mindless characters that are attempting to act.,1382140800,,193,4.647058823529412
3552593,1,B001EED8S2,"This movie is short.  That is its only virtue. The actors are earnest, but the script is so pointless that it isn't worth checking out.  The characters and the story keep alluding to this one night the two main characters spent in school as boys as if something significant happened.  But it is never actually revealed. They allude to homoerotic tension, but I think it was more imposed by my wanting something to happen. Mark, the blond character, is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen.  Don't know why anyone puts up with him.  I didn't understand whey there were friends.  In any case, the decent production values and earnest acting were wasted by a pointless script.",1378425600,,687,4.73109243697479
3552594,1,B001EED8S2,"I watched this while folding laundry, even then it was a freaking waste of time.

The actors, they may have been OK.

The writers should be shot for this.

The producers, they should be shot as well.

This piece of crap should never have made it to production.",1371513600,,260,4.354166666666667
3552595,2,B001EED8S2,"First of all it was difficult to imagine these two main characters as long time ""best friends"" as they could not be more different on all levels and then you add in the fact one is gay the other straight then you know already its(the movie) going to be a bumpy night.

The acting was average, the storyline lacked any muscle and never lured me in but COULD HAVE.  I don't want to ruin the ending but I will say I was actually thankful for an ending to this stinker although the ending itself punctuated how truly disappointing this film was for me.

It received two stars and not one because I adored Michael Majeski's character - whom at the beginning made me smile and laugh a little always trying to make light of the moment or situation.",1370649600,,741,4.355072463768116
3552596,1,B001EED8S2,"Terrible movie, i waited for an hour to see the point of this movie in the next thing I knew the credits were rolling. It's like nothing more than a movie produced by a bunch of high school television production students.",1367107200,,221,4.414634146341464
3552597,1,B001EED8S2,"This movie has only a vague plot.  Two guys, miserable, I guess, who go from Sudbury to Toronto together and act stupid for no obvious reason.  One returns in order to leave Sudbury and the other's partner dumps him (though the movie never gives any background for their relationship or their breakup).  So ends this movie.  It goes nowhere, the characters remain undeveloped, with only hints of a past.  As the action went on, I kept asking myself, ""Where's this going?  Why are they acting like that?  If they're such good friends, why don't they talk to each other?""  If the purpose of the movie was to depict two persons (one gay and in a crumbling relationship, one supposedly straight but probably attracted to his gay friend) who can't communicate and only interact sophomorically (they're 28!), well then it succeeded.  Don't bother...",1366502400,2,843,4.880281690140845
3552598,2,B001EED8S2,This film wasn't very interesting. The characters were okay if not boring. Did anyone else feel like there was more to their flashback to that night in highschool?,1365897600,,163,4.857142857142857
3552599,5,B001EED8S2,Didn't get this one but watched it at a friends home it is worth getting. And I plan on getting a copy soon,1365120000,,107,3.6956521739130435

8297946,1,B001EED8S2,There was no central theme for this movie.  It felt like watching a bunch of disjointed and poorly done scenes.  Definitely low budget film.,1515628800,,140,4.791666666666667
8297947,1,B001EED8S2,I watched this movie waiting for a plot to form but what can you expect from a movie that's just over an hour long. It's basicly two buds hanging out and having a good time while the gay friend gets dumped by his husband or bf whatever. I never got invested in the characters due to bad story line and lack of plot.,1500768000,,315,4.015873015873016
8297948,2,B001EED8S2,Enjoyed the characters but overall had way too many slow spots & could have had a much better ending.,1486166400,,101,4.368421052631579
8297949,2,B001EED8S2,"Tow guys, one a drifting wreck (or slacker) living in the basement of his friend's inherited house seeems nearly suicidal and impotent.  The other is gay, owns a house, has a focused boyfriend, yet chases his companion off with his crass and spendthrift behavior while grating on his tolerant and dependent friend's good-nature.  No savory sexual tensions here [skip to 50 minutes in], just a brisk walk through the lives of two angst-riddled young men who thought their lives would rocket them far and away from their hometown of Sudbury.  There's no time to stop and smell the roses or form a deep insightful understanding of what motivates the two and why this straight friend remains bonded to his gay friend and vice-versa, or how Mark entered the relationship.  Looks like a failed pilot for a gay tv series because the unresolved backstory and dangling threads at the conclusion beg for an episode 2.",1485907200,,907,4.87012987012987

8297954,3,B001EED8S2,"Meh. I wanted more from the plot. I wanted to understand more fully why these two had remained friends for so long. I wanted to understand ""the incident"" from high school, but it's poorly unfolded and revealed. I understand the unspoken crush/wonder-if-my-best-friend-is-gay-too, but there is no resolution to it.
