At times the A&E-produced documentary plays like a commercial for that movie. Based on film excerpts alone, one might conclude that the prolific scriptwriter, critic, essayist and member of the Algonquin Roundtable never had a sober day in her life-- certainly there were reasons for such behavior. Dorothy's troubles began in childhood, when she witnessed the deaths of both her mom and stepmother.

In the 1920s she was best known as a NEW YORKER magazine contributor and for a caustic and eminently quotable wit. Unhappily married three times,  Dottie survived several suicide attempts and did have a drinking problem that worsened with time.

After abandoning the roundtable she helped found, Parker became a Hollywood screenwriter. During the '40s she was a frequent guest on various radio shows. Her extreme left wing attitudes got Parker blacklisted in 1950. In later life she scripted an unsuccessful play and wrote book reviews for ESQUIRE. A number of subsequent movie proposals never materialized and her final few years were spent in near-poverty. Dorothy Parker died of a heart attack in 1967 at age 67. An urn filled with her ashes lay unclaimed for 17 years in a file cabinet at a NY attorney's office.

As of 5/09, ""Infamous Dorothy Parker"" was not available on DVD.
