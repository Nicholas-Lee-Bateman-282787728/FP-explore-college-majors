7158879,5,B00X5UIUEU,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a long running manga series from Hirihiko Araki in Japan that really didn't get much recognition here in America. You ever heard of the Yakuza series from SEGA? In regards of distribution in America, both are treated the same. Maybe once in a while, we would get something Jojo released here in the west (So far, we have the Part 3 manga, the APPP 13 episode part 3 Anime, the CPS3 Capcom Fighting Game, and The 2013 PS3 Game) Now that it is finally getting a DVD release WITH AN ENGLISH DUB IN AMERICA, now there is no excuse to get into the series now. Even if the English Dub ends up mediocre, it will still be a fun ride just with the Japanese Dub alone. As a newcoming fan to the series who started to watch the Anime last September, I can say this is no doubt one of the most fun and unique animes I have seen in a long time, and I cannot stop talking about it.

Story:
This Season actually covers both Part 1 and 2 of the manga. Phantom Blood only had 5 volumes in the original manga, so its covered in the first 9 episodes. Phantom Blood itself is... Ok. In regards to writing, if I told you before that this is Hirihiko Araki earlier works before you watched it, you would probably understand a whole lot. However, thats not to say you should skip PB. Its still filled with awesome moments, memorable characters, and it establishes a reoccurring villain in the series known as Dio. You probably know of him if you heard of the series, or at least know of the ""WRRY"" meme. The thing is, Dio is not the most likable character in Jojo, he is actually the most unlikable. And that does shine through, specifically in the first episode. Dio is a character brought back throughout the entire series, to even becoming the main villain again in Part 3. (OOPS, SPOILERS)  So if you take my word for it, do not skip Phantom Blood. And I think Araki is happy that he finally has a faithful Phantom Blood anime adaption after the unreleased 2007 movie.

Now Battle Tendency. OHH YEAH. I absolutely love this part. You want to know why this is a ""Bizarre"" Adventure? If PB didn't convince you, then Battle Tendency oozes with style and personality with its Opening, characters, lines, and POSES BAYBEE!!! JJBA doesn't take itself too seriously, and that is exemplified in BT. Mostly with the Protagonist or ""Jojo"" of Part 2, Joseph Joestar. The grandson of Part 1's Jojo, Jonathan Joestar. While Jonathan was more noble, and always fought and played by the rules, Joseph is the complete opposite. He is cocky, sneaky, hilarious to watch, spouts in constant engrish, and part of makes BT so great. You also got the Pillar Men, the baddies of BT, and they are as awesome as they sound. As the season goes on, it gets crazier and crazier, ending on one of the most weiredest yet awesome finishes to a villain once you look back and realize what just happened.

Jojo is a great series, and currently, I am watching the second part of the Part 3 anime. And I hope Part 3 gets a DVD dub also!

Next you are going to say: ""I am going to Order this DVD!"" Toyu!",1431907200,11,3076,4.398945518453427
8715099,1,B00X5UIUEU,This show is a 5/5 by far. The 1 star here is for the product itself. The show comes with English and Japanese audio. The only English subtitles for the Japanese audio however are CC for the dub. The menus are even worse. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CO-yChnVAAAANz3.jpg There is one example. I would recommend the show but not this product. A huge company like Warner Bros. should know better.,1442361600,34,393,4.96969696969697
8715100,5,B00X5UIUEU,"The series is great no matter how you look at it. Watching it sub was great now I can see it dub. Regardless which you prefer, this has been far to long to reach the United States and I'm ready! Dio with it and enjoy this highly entertaining show. If Jonathan doesn't win you over, Joseph sure will.",1438128000,4,299,4.172413793103448
8715101,5,B00X5UIUEU,Great show finally getting a english dvd release will be watching subbed though Dio's voice is too got no to hate theres no blu ray but thats fine,1437782400,3,146,4.25
8715102,3,B00X5UIUEU,"While I love Season 1 of Jojo, the only 2 things that are keeping me from buying this is no Blu-ray Set(being the uncensored and high quality version in Japan) and the subtitles for Japan audio would be mistranslated due to ""copyright issues"" with some character names and stuff. Also I saw preview of the English dub.... 2 words... Avoid it.",1436918400,2,342,4.622950819672131
8715103,5,B00X5UIUEU,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is my favorite anime. Started buying the manga, it only makes sense to buy the anime. It's an amazing anime.",1435881600,4,133,4.826086956521739
8715104,5,B00X5UIUEU,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a excellent series! I fully recommend it!,1435363200,,69,5.363636363636363
8715105,4,B00X5UIUEU,"Good that they are localizing this, but where's the Blu Ray?",1435190400,6,60,4.545454545454546
8715106,5,B00X5UIUEU,The first two parts of Jojo on DVD! Amazing dedication to the original Manga featuring Jonathan Joestar & Joseph Joestar!,1433203200,5,121,5.1
8715107,1,B00X5UIUEU,"Only 3 DVDs?! That's absurd. There are too many episodes crammed into these DVDs, the quality will be even more inferior to that of a regular DVD, not to mention this should have been released on Blu-ray. The color in the DVDs are all silver, even though one of the most notable and amazing things about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is how colorful it is. $50 dollars? This should be priced at $22.48 exactly. I can't help it but feel taken advantage of if I buy this set. They went all-out cheap with this set. They clearly don't care about this series, so I ask myself, why didn't they just give it to Viz Media? As a fan and someone who wants to support this series, I completely understand if you would want to buy this, but I just thought I'd let you know if you didn't what you're in store for.",1432166400,18,796,4.2781456953642385
8715108,5,B00X5UIUEU,"I realize this release has not come out yet, but I currently own all of the blu-rays released in Japan for the first season. This show quickly became one of my favorite action anime. It is important to try not to take this series too seriously however, which is the mistake that I made when I first began watching it.

The first story arc overall takes itself more seriously than all of the others that follow it, so it is easy to make this mistake. However, when the show starts introducing cyborg Nazis and Aztec vampires named Wham and ACDC, along with the new protagonist of the second arc, it becomes very clear that this show is supposed to be goofy. The show can be serious at times though and it does these moments very well too. There is a death of a character in the second arc that is especially somber and very well done.

The last thing I need to mention are the fights (this is an action series after all). All of the fights in this series are memorable. There's so much insane, over-the-top stuff that goes on in every single fight: People get rid of frostbite by using just their body heat; caps from soda bottles fly off and break people's fingers; and there is even a battle inside an erupting volcano. This insanity gets amplified even further in later story arcs with the introduction of ""Stands,"" but I'll save that for whenever the second season goes up for pre-order.

Overall, if you like action anime you'll probably like this series. Everyone that I've shown this series to that has some sort of interest in anime has absolutely loved it. It has a very unique charm about it that I have not seen in any other series. My only hope is that this series gets a decent dub to go along with the amazing Japanese version.

EDIT: I got this set about a week early and the English dub is very well done so far. I've only watched the first two episodes, but all of the main characters have been casted very well (with Johnny Young Bosch playing the first JoJo and Patrick Seitz playing Dio). Also yes, this should have been released on blu-ray and with more than 3 DVDs. However, the picture quality is still decent enough. For now let's all just be happy that this show is getting an English release.",1431993600,17,2217,4.426470588235294
