  I love the snappy arms-oriented dance Katia does at the beginning, Habib does a funky number, I could do without whatever Ava Fleming does( a suit and hat? ( i think it is ava fleming)...Desert Sin is enthralling. There are tons more.
  After i watched this casually a couple of times( while knitting), I started dancing, and new moves started coming out of me....it was crazy.
  I will be buying the rest of this series. It is my new dance secret!:)",1235952000,,642,4.539130434782609
