8169495,1,B000MKXF5K,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! This is the really bad dub of One Piece that was created by a company that openly believes kids are stupid and illiterate. If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to. Seriously buy the FUNimation DVDs for a true One Piece experience.",1517875200,,556,4.254716981132075
8169496,1,B000MKXF5K,"This is the horrible edited version by 4kids. Do not buy this, buy the sets by Funimation. Their dub is a good and faithful dub.",1490313600,,128,4.16
8169497,5,B000MKXF5K,"As a kid I used to watch this on KidzWB because I thought all the cool ""kidz"" watched this show if it was only aired on Saturdays. I started from the Arlong Park Arc and I ended when it was cancelled by 4kidz on Alabasta when it was on Toonami and was distraught when I couldn't watch it again for years to come. When I got back into the series in 2014 Funimation had taken over and I started to wonder why Usopp sounded like Krillin and initially thought it was a weird vocal choice and before the Funi dub I had always called Zoro ""Zolo"" so that too was a weird change for me on my first episode re-introducing myself to the series. after about 20 episodes I started to miss Sanji's New York smokers' voice, so I looked up the 4kids dub again and immediately stopped 5 minutes in. I realized how much better the Funi dub really was and why the undid all of 4kidz's changes. That being said, this version is perfect for me currently as I am a new father and want my son to like the things that I like, but I don't want him to be discouraged by all the blood and ""swears"" (if you consider 'dammit' a swear) so I figured I'd start him off with the more benign version of the show and honestly do not regret that decision. The Arlong Park Arc (my favorite in terms of nostalgia) is where I wanted him to start with and it's been fun for the both of us. Nami stabbing her own arm to save Ussop was replaced with her stabbing him with a rubber knife which is hysterical, Sanji's now annoying voice my son gets a kick out of, and he feels like one of the big ""kidz"" for watching it with me. I recommend this for action anime lovers/parents to show their children because it's good enough for them to enjoy until they're old enough to really get into the more adult Funimation dub. I totally stand by this purchase 100%",1449187200,,1813,4.182857142857143
8169498,5,B000MKXF5K,"I know many will disagree because it's the 4Kids version of a great Anime.  However, I personally enjoy this for the sake of it being so bad, it's comedic.",1433721600,,155,4.344827586206897
8169499,5,B000MKXF5K,"This version of the anime is a guilty pleasure for me; I watched these episodes as a kid but I never really knew if they were even available on DVD. Yeah I know everyone hates this version and I'd be lying if I said I didn't see the huge cringe-worthy plot holes and inconsistencies, but you know what this is TV history that should never be forgotten so that another mistake like this will never happen again.",1416700800,,410,4.337662337662338
8169500,3,B000MKXF5K,it was just okay but I hope there are better books in my future. I at least hope so maybe.,1392508800,,90,3.55
8169501,1,B000MKXF5K,"Thought I'd buy this one...hoping, beyond hope, that there would be a Japanese track on this.  Guess what?  Despite the product description...there is NO JAPANESE DIALOG TRACK!!!  Not happy with this line of DVDs, and not happy with Toei or Viz either.  (If there was a version available through Amazon.co.jp with the Japanese dialog and a decent English translation, I would have bought that version a long time ago). I really want to see the UNEDITED VERSION of this series, but I also want a decent translation for it too! Unfortunately, the only versions I have seen is this EDITED version, and the 'crappy translation' version out there on DVD.  Someone PLEASE start selling a GOOD version of the UNEDITED series!!!",1180137600,8,720,4.917355371900826
