8177752,5,B000NI1AK8,"An interesting film showing juvenile delinquency in the mid 1950's.  The film shows a girl gang that robs people at gunpoint.  They rape a young guy while robbing and tying up his girlfriend.  These girls all go to the same high school and two get killed by cops in a gunfight, later one of them is pregnant and dies giving birth and her parents are denied custody of the child because the judge considers them to be unfit parents.",1406332800,,431,4.430379746835443
8177753,5,B000NI1AK8,"You can see where John Waters got some of his ideas from this B-Film. Girl gang goes bad, robbery, murder, unwed motherhood, and uncaring parents. Hosted by the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. She is funnier than Elvira. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1392076800,2,383,4.260273972602739
