2064310,5,B000274T94,"The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn,who just returns home from the army after being gone 8 years. Alot has changed in the small town. The main attraction of the town is the casino,whose security guards are selling drugs to kids. When Vaughn spots the gamer at the craps table switching dice and desides to take care of it,the corrupt casino employees mess him up and leave him for dead. When his nephew almost dies from taking drugs that were bought off the casino's security guards,Vaughn unleahes his one man assault to become sheirff and clean up the town. There's lots of great action and a little bit of humor thrown in. IF you love the Rock or just want to watch a great action film go watch ""Walking Tall"".Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!1",1080864000,,733,4.603053435114504
2064311,4,B000274T94,"I thought this movie was good, and the fact that it is inspired by a true story makes it that much better!  The Rock is the perfect person to play this character. I think this movie had a nice balance of action and comedy, especially with a co-star like Johnny Knoxville. I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it, especially to people who are fans of The Rock!",1080864000,,381,4.442857142857143
2064312,4,B000274T94,"It's always difficult to come up with something new and exciting when you release a film about a macho guy that ""takes out the trash,"" especially when your story is a remake.  It is even more difficult when the storyline is so formulaic that you see every scene coming from a mile away.  So, what makes the 2004 version of WALKING TALL any different?  Simply put, charm!  The Rock continues  to prove that he is worthy of movie stardom by not taking himself so seriously and putting a degree of fun into the role.  Where Van Damme and Seagal have fizzled out, The Rock, my friends, is here to stay.  Also, showing that there is more to talent than being bruised, beaten up, and electrocuted, Johnny Knoxville makes a credible and well-casted addition to the cast as The Rock's right hand man.  Although there isn't anything new to offer, sometimes it's fun to take the same ride with all new friends!",1080604800,,900,4.546583850931677
2064313,3,B000274T94,"(...) hey I loved the guy as a wrestler, but let's face facts, he's not believable in any of his roles outside of a wrestler.  In this movie he plays a war hero who comes back to his town to find it corrupted by an evil man and his casino and greed.  The Rock gets appointed sherrif and with his sidekick Knoxville tries to take back the town for the people.  The plot was pretty good, as it was a remake from an earlier movie by the same name, and Knoxville was likeable in his role.  The movie was enjoyable and much better than the god awful ""Rundown.""  (...)",1080259200,,562,4.1192660550458715
2064314,5,B000274T94,"I saw this movie at a preview in Knoxville, TN and I will definitely say that this is the Rock's best work to date. The movie not based in the orginal setting of the story really captures the essence of what Buford Pusser stood for. The Rock is well on his way to becoming the next big action star of this generation. His movies have a feel much like Lethal Weapon with the seriousness of the role captured along with having funny and lite hearted moments. I would tell anyone that has the chance to see this movie, that is well worth the price that you pay. It has everything that is needed in a good movie, which I feel has been lacking recently. It grabs your attention and doesn't let you go until the credits start. I would rate this movie as Excellent!(...)",1080086400,,763,4.305555555555555

2064336,5,B000274T94,One of my favorite Dwayne Johnson films. Love this movie!,1482624000,,57,4.8
2064337,3,B000274T94,"Released in 2004 and directed by Kevin Bray, Walking Tall is a rural drama/thriller starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as ex-soldier Chris Vaughn, who returns to his small town home in Kitsap County, Washington (the Puget Sound area), where he discovers corruption has taken over; the nucleus being a casino owned by the pompous Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough). Since the police are in league with Hamiliton, Vaughn decides to run for Sheriff to clean up the town. Johnny Knoxville is on hand as Vaughns sidekick while John Beasley plays his dad, Ashley Scott his ex-girlfriend and Kristen Wilson his sister.

This is a loose remake of the hit 1973 film based on real-life sheriff Buford Pusser. The biggest changes are that Vaughn is trying to stop the selling of illegal drugs rather than illegal moonshine, and the film's setting has switched from rural Tennessee to rural Washington (although shot in Squamish, British Columbia, which is close enough geographically).

Walking Tall takes its time to set up the rural town community  Vaughns mixed-racial family, his friends & acquaintances, the police and the workers of the casino. Everything amps-up in the second act when he visits the casino and doesnt like what he sees. This is a solid, if unexceptional, crime drama/action flick marred by a cartoony climax that is so overdone it almost seems cut & pasted from another movie.

The film runs 86 minutes.

The main core of the story is still there but everything else has been Hollywood-ified. I've seen the older 70s version ten billion times and dreaded this (more lost tourists asking where his gravesite is).
I will say, it's a pretty decent movie. Not my favorite, but I'd watch it again.

2064423,4,B000274T94,"The problems I had with this story was the profanity, the seemingly easiness of having sex outside of marriage, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages. I believe because of these things it caused the sheriff not to be as good of an example as he could have been. A cop would not want people using those words when conversing with someone at a traffic stop. Prostitution was looked at negatively, but the same act is o.k. in the heat of the moment. Also, they were fighting drugs, but alcohol is a drug too and it helps to kill people just as well. Thank you for letting me give my opinions.",1424390400,,591,4.381818181818182

There have been times I've felt peeved because of scrawny-looking, unlikely ""heroes"" beating up the big bad guys. This flick has a big good guy who is right at home knocking the bad guys around...big or otherwise. Though the story line is familiar, Dwayne Johnson (""The Rock"") gives it new life. He brings to the screen a fresh mixture of brawn, humor and talent that I find enjoyable to watch. I've seen him in several movies now and I've liked them all.

Hollywood has a habit of taking and doing re-makes of cult classics and making them bomb. This movie however, relying on The Rock's star power from his days in WWE did quite well. I was impressed. I didn't see it in the theaters because I refuse to pay $20 for a movie visit to listen to snooby teens, phones ringing, people getting up and down in the seat in front or people kicking the seat behind me. I'd rather wait for it to come out on Blu-ray a few months later and then shell out the 20 which is what I did. as I said...I was impressed by this.

Ok so the first 45 minutes of the film follows rather loosely the true events that took place, but after that its all extreme fiction not even remotely close to the true events. The man The Rock plays was the real life ex wrestler named Buford Pusser who happened to be married and had kids. this guy isn't even married here and has no kids. Pusser was played by Joe Don Baker in the original 1973 version of the film, which by the way followed the true story much more accurately, not to mention being way, way more superior. This film was simply plain stupid and ignorant of any real facts. Worst of all the guy in this movie isn't even named Buford Pusser, and he breaks more laws than the criminals do. At least Baker portrayed Pusser with some dignity and he knew what boundries not to cross once he became sherrif. This movie just plain sucked. It really sucked.",1367625600,,1031,4.319587628865979

There are many good lines scattered throughout the movie, and it is quite funny.

This isn't actually a re-make in the traditional sense of the word. This movie is more like an update. The filmmakers took the original story and updated the details to fit today's world. It's a short movie at less than an hour and a half, but what's there is as action packed as any movie I've ever seen. It does include a lot of violence like the originals. The themes are the same, though. It gives a feel of the originals but with more humor. I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie dedicated to Sheriff Pusser.

2064535,3,B000274T94,"Walking Tall, 2004 film

This film was inspired by a true story. The film begins by showing a ship on a lake that says the northwest. A man walks through the streets. The wood mill closed down, no work in town. The former sheriff died in a one-car accident (?). Chris learns more about his town. The film slowly introduces the characters, as if padding out the time. The football game does the same. There is a gambling casino in town. Chris sees the dealer switch dice; he wants to try again. Their security forces arrive and the fight begins. Chris is over-powered and banged up, then dumped in the rainy street. He recovers and returns home.

The head of the casino visits Chris and tries to make a deal. The casino operator owns the town. The sheriff is in cahoots with this institution. Does the casino also peddle drugs to teenagers? Chris takes a big stick and returns to the casino to recover his special force medallion that was stolen from him. Jay Hamilton says this has changed our relationship a bit. Chris is arrested and represents himself at the trial. The jury decides on an acquittal! [Jury nullification?] Next Chris is elected sheriff and fires all the deputies. [Isnt democracy great?] A casino is a machine to print dollars. Sheriff Chris wants to clean out the crystal meth production in his county. [This plague of the country is seldom mentioned in Hollywood films. It is mostly domestically produced.]

One suspect is arrested and his truck take apart in a search for drugs. Will there be revenge against Chris or his parents? [Will there be a lull in the story to surprise the viewers with sudden action?] The sheriffs truck explodes, his office is machine gunned. There is a shoot out, and the bad guys bite the dust. Chris learns where the meth lab is hidden. Who can put up the money and then distribute it over the country? Will there be a final duel between Chris and Jay? Guess who wins? Will this return peace and prosperity to this town?

The original 1972 film had a raw and gritty story that was far better. This film is slower paced with fewer actors, showing its low budget and cheaper script. This diluted version omits any references to crooked politicians in the state capital, and organized crime. It is another morality play where the good guys are challenged then win in the end. A gambling casino has to be near a big city to draw in the suckers to be sheared of their money. Do they gaff the games to ensure a profit? Do stock brokers sell over-valued securities? Gambling creates crime and poverty, look what it did to Atlantic City NJ and other such places.

Many gambling casinos have been built since the 1970's; they take money from the many to give to the few, a classic form of exploitation. The odds are rigged to favor the house. Casinos are amusement parks for adults, there is a cost for entertainment. The only honest games are those who benefit some charity, else there will be a moral hazard to increase the odds.",1224028800,,2974,4.582706766917293

I think two things we can all say about WWE Films are that: one- they will never be taken seriously, and two- they mostly produce under whelming films. WWE Films however played very little role in the making of this movie. The Rock and MGM Studios put on a very entertaining movie full of action and emotion.

Chris Vaughn, played by The Rock, returns home from the Special Forces. He soon found out that his home sweet home isn't the same place he left. It is a world filled with drugs. The drugs come from a casino owned by Chris's friend, Jay Hamilton.

Chris goes out with his friends to the casino to have a good time. He soon becomes agitated to find out that they are using loaded dice to screw people out of their money. The Rock, being the man that he is, takes exception to this and begins to tear the Casino to pieces in a brawl with security. Chris gets caught though and is taking to be brutally torn apart by them in a back room. They throw him out in the street for dead.

Luckily, The Rock lives and seeks vengeance. He soon becomes the sheriff and begins working on fixing the town. He quickly recruits one of his best friend's, Ray, to be his only officer. Ray is played by Johnny Knoxville and he does a great job of bringing a comical sense to this movie. It creates a good balance.

Chris's weapon of choice is a large piece of Cedar. That's right, he uses a huge piece of wood to put the hurt on people. This leads to some great action scenes. They use guns later on in the movie, but the scenes with the cedar are much better.

I would suggest this DVD to anyone. There are two extra commentaries worth listening to. One is by The Rock and the other is by the Director and Crew. Both of them are worth listening to. Other extras include deleted scenes, bloopers, and an alternate ending.",1215216000,,1823,4.287790697674419

Walking Tall is a remake of [[ASIN:B000VDDDWI Walking Tall].  This time the Rock stars as an Army Officer who has come home to find his hometown full of vice and corruption.  In this movie he finds a 4X4 versus an axe handle to use as a ""helper"".  I think I'd prefer the axe handle.  Highly recommended for fans of the Rock and for people who think Wrestling is real, but the moon landing was fake.

2064540,4,B000274T94,"Former Army Sergeant, Chris Vaughn (The Rock), returns to his home town to discover that it is now controlled by a slimy casino owner who peddles sex, drugs and gambling to the townsfolk. After his young nephew almost dies of an overdose from drugs that originated in the casino, Vaughn runs for sheriff and cleans up the town.

""Walking Tall"" is essentially just an old-fashioned Western in a modern setting. The plot is very simple: there is virtually no character development, no unexpected plot twists, and everyone is exactly what they appear to be; and is essentially just a vehicle for 75 minutes (it's not a very long film) of gratuitous violence. In fact, because of this, some people may consider this film to be unwatchably bad. Nevertheless, fans of The Rock do not watch his films for his superior acting ability and will probably love every moment of it.

Comparing this to other films starring The Rock, this is one of his better films. The scene where he trashes the casino is really great (after watching it, I immediately skipped back and watched it again), as is the subsequent trial and the supporting actors manage to hold their own (Johnny Knoxville as The Rock's deputy is great, as is Neal McDonough as the villain).

""Walking Tall"" is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title (which was based on a true story) and has spawned two straight to DVD sequels starring Kevin Sorbo. The original movie, itself, also spawned two sequels and a TV series.",1206316800,,1472,4.6976744186046515
2064541,4,B000274T94,"When the Rock is in a movie about cleaning house, beating the tar out of people, and all out manly shenanigans, there is pretty much a guaranteed good movie on the horizon.  In fact, Walking Tall has already established itself well enough to be included in the small selection of great guy movies shown over and over and over on TBS (The list also includes: The Outsiders, Red Dawn, Heartbreak Ridge, and Road House).

The Rock plays the role of Chris Vaughn, a man just back from war and his stint in the Army, who is looking forward to returning to his home town in Washington and enjoying life post-military.  The role is based on the true story of Buford Pusser, a man who, because of his name, simply had to be tough, and as sheriff, took the law into his own hands.  Vaughn, like Pusser, runs into a town that needs help, and he's just the man to do it.  And how's he going to do it?  Oh, wait, did he just pick up?...yeah...he did.  He just picked up a massive 5-foot piece of wood, and he plans on breaking the arms and legs of everyone in his way.

In true tough-guy-takes-on-entire-town fashion, Vaughn soon finds his protagonist (John Beasley), who is only important in the sense that there needed to be a bad-guy who gets either his face bashed in or an appendage snapped in two.  It turns out that there is a town-wide conspiracy involving drugs and the local cash-cow casino.  It's so deep even the sleazy local cops are involved, all but providing personal bodyguard services to the bad guys and his drug dealers at the casino.

It's up to Rock, who teams up with his old buddy (Johnny Knoxville), to become sheriff, take down the bad guys, and save the town.  Along the way he hooks up with a former classmate (Ashley Scott), who is basically in the movie because she's gorgeous, looks great in a red bra, and fulfills the minimum of one hot-woman-in-action-movie rule.  What ensues is a bunch of The Rock doing what The Rock does, cool demeanor, tough-guy antics, and eyebrow pushups rule as he shows everyone involved that he walks just a little taller than they do.",1204848000,,2084,4.496021220159151

2064545,4,B000274T94,"Walking Tall is a remake of the 1973 film, which is in turn a ""semi-biopic"" of Sheriff Buford Pusser.  Ironically enough, Pusser was a former professional wrestler-turned lawman in McNairy County, Tennessee.  For those of you keeping track, the Buford Pusser was renamed to Chris Vaughn (in the world of macho movies, this is understandable) and his background was changed from wrestling to Special Forces.  Which is funny, because Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who plays the role of Vaughn, is a former professional wrestler turned actor.

In this action movie, Vaughn returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington (instead of Pusser's actual McNairy County, Tennessee) from a stint in the Special Forces.  We're not sure what Vaughn did, but it must have been ugly, because he never speaks about it and answers questions about people he killed with a sad stare.  Unfortunately, Kitsap County has gone downhill since the local lumber mill closed.  His father, Vaughn Sr. (John Beasley) is out of work.  Vaughn's sister Michelle (Kristen Wilson) has become a cop, but her son Pete (Khleo Thomas) hangs out with the wrong crowd. Heck, even Vaughn's old girlfriend Deni (Ashley Scott) has become a stripper.  All these sins can be blamed on Vaughn's old high school rival, Jay Hamilton (played with sneering arrogance by Neal McDonough).

Vaughn's return is cause for celebration by his friends, including the recovering alcoholic Ray (Johnny Knoxville, of all people), who treat him to a night of gambling and debauchery at Hamilton's premiere casino.  But the whole place is dirty, where gamblers cheat and drugs are given to kids.  It's at this point that Walking Tall flirts with cartoonish levels of evil.  Even Hamilton points this out: ""Why would I sell drugs when I own the entire town already?"" Why indeed?

Vaughn goes nuts once he discovers that the place is corrupt, and his fisticuffs earn him a form of vicious revenge from the security staff that involves a box cutter and a lot of cutaway scenes of Vaughn screaming.  Left to die, he manages to recover on his parents' sofa.  The sheriff (Michael Bowen) and his deputies are obviously in Hamilton's pocket and refuse to help. When Vaughn's nephew overdoses on drugs gained from Hamilton's casino, Vaughn's had enough: he takes a four-foot hickory club and smashes the place up.  That's just the first half of the movie.

Returning to reality, Vaughn's outburst causes him to be brought up on several charges, brought by the very people who cut him up the first time.  Vaughn wins the case by appealing to squeamishness of the jury, who wince once he shows them the scars from the box cutter.  ""If you acquit me of these charges, I'll run for sheriff!"" he shouts.  And they do.  And he does. What happens next is a good old-fashioned butt-whupping from a big man with a big stick.

I didn't expect much from an action movie headlined by a wrestler, but Walking Tall distinguishes itself in several ways that make it worth watching:

IT'S MULTIETHNIC: Vaughn's father is black, his mother is white; Vaughn's girlfriend is white. The movie doesn't make a big deal about it.

IT KNOWS ITS LIMITATIONS: The Rock is huge.  This obvious fact is used against Vaughn when he's on trial, as the poor, beat-up thugs make him out to be a monster.  And he sort of is...he's just a monster you want on your side. Ray is both pathetic and amusing, but mostly pathetic, as only Knoxville can play him.

IT UNABASHEDLY LOVES ACTION: This movie is about good guys beating up bad guys.  Although Vaughn's Special Forces training is curiously absent from most of the film, he does get into fistfights and gunfights with everybody. The fighting is fast and furious but never overtly cinematic.  There are lots of thuds, grunts, and crunches.

I like The Rock.  He's handsome and sleek in a way that other muscle-bound stars are not, conveying both strength and speed.  He doesn't come off as a brutal thug by just looking at him, unless he's standing next to someone else.  And because Johnson is famous for arching his eyebrow in ironic ""am I for real or what?"" pose, he's able to pull off comedy by standing next to someone considerably smaller, like Knoxville.

Walking Tall has both heart and muscle, a feel-good tale about a tough guy who stands up for his hometown in an era when nobody seems to be standing up for anything anymore.",1169424000,2,4385,4.809078771695594

I think they changed his name because it was so far gone from the original plot that it wouldn't be fair to use his name. I understand what they tried to do in this movie, but I just didn't care for it personally.

I also think this movie was way too short. I may have been able to live with the changes from the original ""walking tall"" movies, but just when this movie starts to get good it ends.

Walking Tall is a movie that won't make you particularly happy after it's over, or make you think you wasted your time.  It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments.  The Rock is pretty convincing in his roll but the biggest problem with the film is that it's WAY too short and actually feels rushed during certain spots (like for instance, when the Rock becomes the sheriff- there should have been more build-up here instead of him suddenly ""being the sheriff"").

The police can't help because they are part of the corruption. That leaves the hero to take on the system almost single handedly. He kicks butt and has his own kicked a few times as well.

Its nice to see the good guys win.",1156032000,,705,4.253731343283582
2064552,4,B000274T94,"Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).

This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.

Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness. The laugh he uses (I don't know if that's his real laugh) when he and Chris are watching television is just plain out infectious.

Basically, this little actioner, the Rock's follow up to the superior The Rundown, doesn't have anything new to say. It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time. It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.  It gets 3 and a half stars from me.",1152230400,,3185,4.650088809946714

We didn't get our lisence yet, so we watched it a bunch because there's cool car scenes. This movie was real good because it has one of the best actors, duane johnson aka THE ROCK.  Even better than the acting, was the screenplay.  THE ROCK WROTE THE WHOLE MOVIE HIMSELF!!!  That just blows me away. In the special features DVD when I bought a few there was a scene about the making of the movie, he said he wanted to get naked guys in teh forest, lol~~. Anyway I recomend this movie to anyone who likes movies and action in movies and funny guy Johnny Knoxvilll! I like the seen when he pulls the guy over I hope the Rock doesn't break my taillight too when I get my Porsh.

Which is  a good thing, it doesn't drag but keeps up the action. No real character or plot developement is in this film, but that doesn't keep the film from being entertaining. The Rock and Knoxville both show that they are both incredible actors when they want to be and I have to say that I was impressed with both of them as well. The movie itself was well done, although the story could have been a little deeper as stated earlier. The characters in the film are hardly introduced at all.

There's some scenes in there that you can tell are just filler, like there was nothing else they could put there to be more entertaining then what they got... the writing could be a lil better too...

but i do like that fact that this movie is based on a true story or true events... that's cool...

but if you're looking into buying this movie, don't pay more then $10 or $12 for it... it's not worth it.

I give it 3 1/2 stars, not 3 or 4 but 3 1/2's. It's average... If you're looking for something just to throw on for friends, a party, or cuase you're bored, throw this one on... but if you want a movie, (a classic), that you want to watch repeatedly, this might not be the one for you... unless you are a Rock fan..",1141603200,,1031,4.064039408866995
2064564,5,B000274T94,"I though this movie was too short. The Rock plays Chris Vaughn an ex military man returning home to find the town where he grew up in trouble. The police force is corrupt and the townspeople have become oppressed by the casino bosses. The Rock on his first day back in town gets beat up and tortured by the casino security after the Rock calls a craps dealer out on his cheating.

But he quickly recuperates and takes vengeance on the casino. Smashing machines and breaking arms. Then while in court the evidence is mounting against him. The Rock fires his lawyer for some reason and represents himself by somehow being allowed to give a closing statement instead of you know, doing proper court things. As he stands over the jury he claims he is going to run for sheriff and clean up this town and that is why he is innocent of smashing private property and assaulting 6 people. Then he opens his shirt to reveal the healed scar across his chest from the torture that took place 12 minutes before.

He is indeed found innocent. And then immediately elected sheriff. At once he fires the entire police force and hires one friend; Johnny Knoxville to be his deputy. They immediately go on a corrupt spree of revenge and abuse of power.

Now it is the casino's turn for revenge. They open fire on the police station where the Rock was about to make time with an ex stripper from the casino. An old girlfriend; we are supposed to assume. Of course The Rock and the stripper make it out.

From here on it is ass kicking all over the place. Then it was over as fast as it came, like a Florida rain shower in the summer. It came, dropped it's load and vanished leaving only a wet spot.

I think he killed everyone in the town. there was just nobody left, so he just kinda looked at the camera, yelled cut and then killed the camera man. then the credits rolled. but everything was done by the Rock.

I give it three thumbs up.",1140825600,,1920,4.364145658263305
2064565,2,B000274T94,"I don't know how anyone in this era can support a film like this. I never saw the original or its sequels, fearing the films would be loaded with gratutitous violence for no good purpose other than bloodletting. This one sure is.

I realize there was really a Buford Pusser and he set out to clean up the debauchery and degradation of a small town. However, that is no justification for what goes on in this film.

Our ""hero"", The Rock (AKA Darrell Johnson who admitted to using liposuction as part of his process to get a great build) comes home and is almost immediately put off by the debauchery and drug dealing going on in his community.

He tries to affect this and gets beat up for it. When he recovers he commits about 20 felonies, then goes on trial, saying he did it for revenge, and if the townsfolk on the jury would acquit him he'd run for sheriff and clean up the despicable place.

Guess what? They acquit him! Then he commits more felonies in the name of the sheriff -- with his ridiculous deputy helping out -- by denying an arrestee either a phone call or legal representation and tearing apart his personal property in a so-called ""search"" for drugs.

This is followed by the beauty going over to his side and the bad guys attacking him with automatic weapons. They shoot a lot but miss him all the time.

How can anyone suggest this is good and worthy filmmaking when the hero is more of an antihero than Dirty Harry ever was? I thought this movie was so ridiculous it made ""Death Wish 5"" look like a masterpiece.

And I pity anyone that forked over $7 to see this at the theatre. Among other things, it is only 75 minutes duration, making it one of the briefest theatrical releases I know of.",1140480000,2,1713,4.384858044164038

2064569,2,B000274T94,"As society in general became progressively more liberal in the 1970's, an entire genre of films rose up in reaction to the trend - movies in which an individual, frustrated with a legal system that seemed to be coddling criminals, took it upon himself to mete out his own brand of ""frontier justice,"" usually involving personal vengeance and vigilante-style violence.  The seminal films of this genre - ""Billy Jack,"" ""Dirty Harry,"" ""Death Wish"" and ""Walking Tall"" - all found favor with mass audiences, although critics tended to dismiss them as, at best, reactionary, and, at worst, neo-fascist in nature.  Now, one of them, ""Walking Tall,"" has been retrofitted to cater to audiences in the already far more conservative 21st Century.

The original 1973 ""Walking Tall"" was based on the true story of Buford Pusser, the sheriff of McNairy County, Tennessee, who won fame by single-handedly wiping out the criminal elements who had overrun his town.  It was a one-man ""crusade for justice"" that came at great personal cost to himself and his family (his wife was murdered and Pusser died a few years later in a ""mysterious"" car accident).  In this new version - which eliminates most of the grittier elements of the story and turns it into a rock'em-sock'em, live-action cartoon - Pusser`s name has been changed to Chris Vaughn and the locale has been moved from the Appalachians to the Pacific Northwest.  Chris is a recently discharged soldier who, upon returning to his small hometown, discovers that the place has become a hotbed of vice and corruption, its citizenry forced to live in fear under the tyrannical control of the local casino owner and all-around meanie, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough).  When Chris has finally had a bellyful of malfeasance and sleaze, he decides to run for sheriff, vowing to bring the criminals to their knees, and thus allowing the good folks of the town to reclaim their community.

This is a silly and shallow film whose only real purpose seems to be to give the perpetually self-righteous and outraged Vaughn an excuse to hurl endless bric-a-brac and breakaway furniture around the set while the local townsfolk look on in slack-jawed amazement.  Never one to be deterred by such quaint and fusty notions as civil liberties or Miranda rights, Sheriff Vaughn chases down the bad guys one by one, smashing heads and busting bones as he goes.  The plot is so underdeveloped that the final confrontation scene between Chris and his arch nemesis, Hamilton, feels like a mere afterthought.  The film runs barely 75 minutes, yet boasts a 10-minute long closing credit sequence to pad it out to 85!  It's as if even the filmmakers themselves had run out of interest in the project  and figured they might as well just wrap things up as quickly as possible so they would be free to move on to bigger and better things.

Usually, in a film based on true life events, when the names are changed, it's to protect the innocent.  In the case of ""Walking Tall,"" it's more likely that the people who made the film were trying to protect themselves from being sued by the Pusser estate.",1135296000,3,3108,4.848771266540643

The basic premise : Take a very large, strong man (who is known for inflicting pain on other large, strong men with his bare hands in a wrestling ring), send him back to his beautiful hometown to see his family. Sprinkle a bit of evil in the form of drugs, prostitution and a casino over the top. Gang up on, and almost kill the large, strong man in a gutless, unfair fight.

This new film is solid through and through, but although the run time is an hour and twenty-six, the movie seems too short.  The end credits are rolling sooner than you would expect.

The Rock is a good actor, he is gorgeous, and the movie is inspiring.  Johnny Knoxville adds humor to what is sometimes a very grim story, as standing up for what you believe in sometimes comes with a terrible price.

The DVD is a great buy.  It contains deleted scenes, bloopers, an alternate ending, stunts featurette, and audio commentary by the Rock, crew, and director.",1132963200,,736,4.572519083969466
2064572,3,B000274T94,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is back in his 4th movie, although better then the Mummy 2, it's not as much fun as Scorpion King or Rundown.  It is considered a remake, but if you haven't seen the original, don't worry, that won't be necessary to enjoy this. Logic was pretty much left on the cutting room floor as was alot of the movie as it's only 86 minutes, and I think that is one of it's major flaws. Don't get me wrong, I still had alot of fun watching it, but it could have been so much better with a tighter script and about 30 minutes longer.

I have no problems with the Rock, he has been a blast in everything he's done so far, and you can see he is improving every role. Johnny Knoxville is fine as his best friend, they are an amusing team that blended well together. Neal McDonough is the  villian, and a little bland. Also, Ashley Scott looks great in her red bra and panties, which she is in during a silly shoot out that could have been handled a little better. But that's it, she looks sexy, but not the world's strongest actress.

The Rock comes back from his military duties to find his town has become a dump and his nephew hooked on drugs. He then finds out one of his childhood best friends has become the town's main drug dealer and owner of a corrupted casino. In order to fight this, he becomes sheriff and whoops some big-time butt. The scene where he goes mental in the casino and destroys anything that gets in his way in not-to-be-missed.

The love story could have been completely nixed in order to give us more action and fight scenes, or even more screen time with Knoxville and Rock. There is no heat or any sparks here, as I said before Scott bores us to death, I'm not sure what else she's been in but I'm hoping she was tons better.

I do own the original, and while it is a far superior movie, it does not have the charm that this version contains, this is mostly because of The Rock, he is so much fun to watch, and I do agree with most reviewers who say he could be the next big action star. Actually, I think he is already there, I have not yet seen Doom, but I am really looking forward to it. Let's just hope it's better then the last few movies based on video games we've had the ""pleasure"" of watching (remember Alone in the dark? how about House of the dead?)

2064575,4,B000274T94,"I really liked the previous review of this movie.  I both agree and disagree with the previous reviewer, though.  Mainly, I disagree with the fact that the previous reviewer says the movie claims to be based on the original movie, but is not.  I think the this movie is based on the idea of the original movie in the sense that there is a guy standing up against local corruption.  The original is outdated for our times.  It should almost only be seen as an historical piece.

Like the original movie, I think the most exciting action scene happens in the middle of the movie, not the end, where he goes into the bar and ""does his thing"" when he finds that there is a major problem with the folks running the place and what has happened to his hometown.

I think it is a very moderized version of the original.  Still, considering that the original was based on a true story and this one is fiction, there are discrepencies as the previous reviewer pointed out.

So, it is hard to call the new Walking Tall a ""remake"" of the original.  Rather, it is an ""adaption"" of the original to modern times.

Basically, The Rock plays a really honorable guy who you feel good about in the movie.  I say, ""relax.""  Let the obvious problem with reality and connections to the original pass you by and enjoy this movie.  Enjoy it for what it is and don't make too many connections to the original.  If you are a fan of The Rock, you will like this.  His character is very likable.

Still, as the previous reviewer explains, there are many C. Bronson type scenes in the movie. That comparison, for me, is spot on.  If you like Bronson-type action, great!  If you don't, then I recommend against watching this.

Definitely a 4 star movie for me...",1118966400,2,1732,4.420886075949367
2064576,3,B000274T94,"With 'Rundown,' The Rock proved he would be the action star of the next generation, and though 'Walking Tall' is not as good as the predecessor, it is still an enjoyable action film with bone-crunching fights and big shoot-outs.  Don't expect something original here -- director Kevin Bray ('All About the Benjamins') did only a pedestrian job -- but the charisma of The Rock is presented intact, even when he is in an obligatory love scene with Ashley Scott.

The story is a standard one, like you have seen thousand times in good, old Western movies.  The Rock is Chris Vaughn, war hero coming back to his quiet hometown near the mountains.  There the old lumber mill where his father worked has been closed, and a big casino run by Chris' old friend has become the economic center of the place.

Now read 'the casino' as 'the bar,' and 'his old friend' as 'his nemesis.'  Add to them 'corrupt cops' and 'a sidekick/comic relief' (played by Johnny Knoxville).  The film's script is made with pieces from the old traditional Western films, and like these Western someone must right the wrongs.  And it's The Rock, who does it with a piece of cider, and later an oak bat.

Though the actions are decent, and the last 20 minutes of the film are full of them, 'Walking Tall' takes some time to build up the tension before them, and you may find that preliminary part a little dull.  But The Rock, even when he is not doing actions, is always watchable, brief conversations with Chris' troublemaking nephew, or comical dialogues with Knoxville.

They say, 'Walking Tall' is a remake of the trilogy based on the real-life incidents of Sheriff Buford Pusser.  Let's forget that.  With The Rock as the star, this MGM re-make wisely avoids the Charles Bronson-type violent revenge scenario, and opts for less blood-soaked, more cartoonish actions.  For all its claim saying 'Based on the True Story,' 'Walking Tall' is never about Sheriff Pusser.

in that one hour 15 mintues, the movie is fast, action packed and flat out awesome. the characters are all awsome, the acting is realisitic and the story is very real. the movie revolves around chris vaughn, a former special forces member who comes back home and finds that home isn't what it used to be. drugs are now a common thing and the once thriving mill, which employed a good portion of the town is closed while a new casino has replaced the mill. along with the casino comes the sex, drugs and gambling.

vaughn, who is left for dead after getting into a fight with the casino security guards vows to turn the town around and clean it up.

He then wants revenge, he goes to the Casino, and busts up everything with a 2X4, and They sue him for property damage, he proves to the court that he is innocent, and becomes the sheriff, carfully picking on his rival(Neal McDonough), with the help of his buddy, Ray Templeton(Johnny Knoxville). They end up stopping him and restoring the town back to decentcy

I liked this film mainly because of Dwayne Johnson's performance, He is well suited for action films, he has the build, the stanima, to do all the stunts. As usual, Johnny Knoxville keeps us laughing as the deputy. I had one problem with this film, It was too short, It felt like the director wanted to get the film out of the way, and not have any dedication to it. Overall, it is a  very good action film, but lacks a original plot, and has some action movie cliches'",1110412800,,1377,4.417322834645669

Script is bad, acting is bad. When Johnny Knoxville is, by far, the best thing about your movie, you're in trouble.

He's tough still but he cares for his hometown and the kids. There's a bit of Firstblood in the storyline and I really don't know why Johnny Knoxville starred because his comedy just never works.

The old mill that was the main revenue for jobs in the town closed and a casino opened and is ran by hone of his old ""friends"".  Drugs are running the streets, and his nephew is on them as well, as is most of the town.  The cops are crooked and the Casino provides the drugs to the town with no one bothering them.  After being attacked and left for dead at the casino by 6 men, after he sees a craps dealer switching dice to loaded ones, he decides to take the law in his own hands.  He destroys a bunch of the machines and the casino as well as beat the hell out of the 6 men who left him for dead and The Rock gets acquitted and runs for sheriff and wins.  He makes his best friend, Johnny Knoxville, the deputy and they start to take down the bad guys.  At the end the casino owner, former sheriff and some of their goons try to kill The Rock and his family but they fail.  The Rock then re-opens the mill (which was being used to manufacturre the illegal drugs) and closes the casino.

The movie is based on a true story, and it has a lot of action and jokes as well, but in only an hour and 25 minutes long.  A good movie to watch however and I'd recommend it.  Not to mention the Rock does give a good performance.",1106179200,,1337,4.003773584905661

its as easy as that.

the story line is straight forward the guy (The Rock) has been away for about 8 years in the army comes home and everything and everyone he know has changed because of some prick. So he sorts everything out in his own way with a piece of 2-4 and its very wicked!

The rest of the movie was similarly predictable

2) The good and bad of it all is that this was just an excuse for action.
The good = it wasn't bad action and stuff got blown up. Cool!
The bad = we really don't care about many of the characters and some are completely forgotten after they are introduced in the first part of the movie.

OVERALL: I liked The Rundown a lot more than this, but this was much better than Scorpion King. I hope The Rock gets some good sci-fi action to portfolio like Vin Diesle has the Riddick stuff.

That's right baby! A truck for a truck! A TRUCK FOR A TRUCK!!!""

Nevertheless this movie has one big selling point, one that Hellboy, incidentally, lacks. You see, both movies came out on my twenty-first birthday, and I decided to watch them as a double feature, as well as polish off a handle of $10 vodka with my friend Tom. Now, I don't remember all that much of Hellboy since it was the second movie we saw and by then I was way too loaded to care, but I'm pretty sure it sucked. Walking Tall, however, was sensational. I attribute this discrepancy to the fact that alcohol helps people identify with hicks, but it in no way induces similar empathy toward flaming superheroes modeled after fiddler crabs. In conclusion: Walking Tall is a fine complement to a night of binge drinking, whereas Hellboy is just a mediocre production glorified by film students named Mike.",1104883200,2,1247,4.8

Whereas the pacing is fairly fast, there are a few moments that are glossed overy quickly.  The one that stands out the most is when the Rock goes from almost being thrown in jail to town sherrif.  Any sense of realism goes out the window with the trial.  At the moment, the movie turns into another oridinary Stephen Segal action movie which is long on action and fighting and short on brains and creativity.

Don't get me wrong, The Rock's personality does light up the screen.  He has a style and certainly has a future in motion pictures outside of the slam bam action thrillers.

Since I was strictly informed not to get any chick-flicks, I figured this was the best choice.  It is based on a true story about a guy named Beauford Pusser (gross name) who after comming home from the millitary notices a great deal of change in his home town. The mill he and his father once worked at is now closed and the main source of income for this small town is the casino/strip club owned by his former friend.

2064604,3,B000274T94,"This movie was dumb. Really dumb. So dumb that I couldn't stop laughing. I was frankly amazed that anyone could produce a movie as bad as this one and still posess the mental facilities to feed and clothe themselves. Maybe someone else does it for them... like at an institution or something.

The first 1/3 of the movie involves the Rock meeting old friends and everyone fake laughing and smiling while they hug and pretend to love each other. Then it gets dumb.

The trailers make this movie look like it has some sort of coherant plot and rising action. Trailers lie. The legal basis for everything that happened is the movie was a hilariously childish view of justice. You can't be aquitted of a crime (brutal premeditated assault) simply because the target ""deserved it"".

All of the plot turns are boring and hilariously cliche. I wouldn't care, seeing as it's supposedly an ""action"" movie of some sort; however, said action was conpicuously absent from the film. What you get instead is watered down, silly clips of grown men pawing at each other; and a few gun-driven scenes that might be vaugely cool if they situation and dialogue surrounding them weren't so hilariously retarded.

The romance follows the basic ""woman brings man leftovers, woman and man have intercourse"" formula. I guess she was attractive, in a promiscuous way.

Nothing that is intended as humor in the movie is even remotely funny.

If you want to laugh at a horribly, profoundly silly and stupid movie, this isn't a bad shot. However, if you're looking for a cool, badass action romp, or real humor, or romance, or semi-believable human emotion, or a plot, or a vague connection with reality - look elsewhere.",1100736000,3,1692,4.817241379310345
2064605,2,B000274T94,"As far I could tell, ""Walking Tall"" propels two polar opposite responses. Most men, upon seeing the film, promptly jaunt to the bathroom to behold their biceps in front of the mirror. Women, bullied into tagging along in retribution for the last chick flick they forced their date to view, make a dead sprint for the bathroom for a different reason. This is to disgorge the heavy helping of testosterone-induced rubbish that flickered before their eyes for a never-ending 90 minutes.

For the most part, I'm usually all for dumbed-down, explosive tumult splashed onto a silver screen. That is, if it is done properly. ""The Rundown,"" The Rock's most recent film prior to this one, serves as a prime example of this. The film blew me away. I was thoroughly entertained, applauding myself for $6 well spent.

However, at the end of ""Walking Tall,"" I found myself conforming to the ideology of the prototypical female audience member. Indeed, there I was, dejectedly curled around a toilet bowl with a noticeably lighter wallet expelling all of the dunderheaded remnants of ""Walking Tall."" This all occurs to the chorus of ""bad ass"" and ""cool"" being exclaimed from the other taut gentlemen present. (Rest assured, a second viewing of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" acted as my salvation. Good golly, Mr. Tarantino is a marvel.)

""Walking Tall"" is a remake of a 1973 box office smash. Speaking of which, whatever happened to originality in the moviemaking industry? For heaven's sake, four of the past six movies I've reviewed have been remakes. I beg someone to e-mail me and rationalize why the Antarctica hell-fire ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" are being remade.

Anyhow, The Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Douglas Johnson, stars as war hero Chris Vaughn who has just returned to his hometown from service overseas. He finds out the mill has been shut down, a casino has sprung up and neighborhood kids are suddenly all crack addicts.

As it turns out, his high school nemesis Jay Hamilton Jr., played contemptibly by Neal McDonough, is the mastermind behind this cesspool of greed.

Vaughn, in a fit of rage, grasps an oak club and embarks on a mission to obliterate the casino to smithereens. After doing so, he defends himself in court with a fervent speech that eventually catapults him to the position of town sheriff.

Vaughn then contracts an old buddy named Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville) to be his deputy. Knoxville glimmers as one of the few bright spots in the film. There is no hesitation in my voice when I say that this man, the death-defying ""Jackass"" honcho, has a future ahead of him in Hollywood.

From here on out ""Walking Tall"" is an abysmal medley of improbable fight scenes coupled with quick cuts and loud music. To summarize my thoughts on the film: Ahhh!",1100476800,,2779,4.872881355932203

2064607,4,B000274T94,"This remark of an original 1973 biography of Sheriff Buford Pusser falls far from the original but has some redeeming qualities.

The Rock (Chris Vaughan) manages to pull off a decent role in this film as a man returning to his home town only to find it corrupted by drug dealers and a bought off police force. In typical macho bravado this movie contains more fight scenes than dialogue but at least the fight scenes are worth the wait. The Rock is definitely not someone any normal person would mess with! But playing his nemesis effectively is Neal McDonough who has the act of evil down pat. The story is pretty basic but interesting enough to sustain a film that only lasts 75 minutes. Humor is inflected throughout this movie by the incomparable Johnny Knoxville who plays a bumbling deputy trying to live up to The Rock's ability in a physical sense.

Overall if you like action movies this is a decent bit of entertainment. It will definitely inspire a bit of ""whoop-ass"" and integrity as it begs to attack the power and seduction of drugs being filtered down to our children. The Rock pulls off a better than average performance here but I would have preferred the story had it stuck to the original heroic tale.",1099872000,4,1221,4.622119815668203

This is a bare knuckles, down-to-earth action flick. Too bad that I could only buy the PG-13 version. According to The Rock's comments, there is an R-rated version which includes a little more spicy stuff. Not that it would affect the plot in any negative way. Is just that I hate censorship.

Revenge and Cleanup are the themes here, a lot of good guy/bad guy encounters, and more destruction of property and sets than you can imagine.  It makes its point (thus 3 stars), chiefly because of the presence of The Rock (oh, that he would change his name!) and his rehabbed sidekick Johnny Knoxville who actually make the film watchable.

2064612,2,B000274T94,"Walking Tall is a remake of the original film with the same name from 1973, which was directed by Phil Karlson.  The original takes place in Tennessee and the remake in the state of Washington.  In the original story the hero is a former wrestler named Buford Pusser and in the remake the hero is a retired Army Special Forces sergeant.  However, the premise is the same as a once peaceful small town has now turned into a sweltering spot for crime and corruption and one man decides to stand up for the town and cleanse the town of its corrupt elements.

The story is loosely adapted from a true story into an action packed adventure about a young man, Chris Vaughn (The Rock), returning after having been discharged from the army.  Chris wants to find a job in the old mill, but to his disappointment he finds out that the mill has been shut down since he left his small town to join the military.  It also disappoints him that the town has turned into a corrupt haven for criminals and thugs where ordinary people have to fear for their lives and see their children being lead into drugs and lives of crime.  When Chris finds himself cornered and his family threatened he decides that the line has been crossed and he takes the matter into his own hands in order to find a stop to the nonsense.

Walking Tall is, as mentioned, a remake of the original film, but it also becomes a copy of other similar films such as First Blood, Commando, Hunted, and other films where one man fights the rights of others.  The Rock's presence is without a doubt very charismatic, however, it does not save the film.  As the story unfolds the moral message disappears in a mauling of violence and action sequences where machine guns are fired and axes are swung.

I remember watching the original Walking Tall back in 1973.  It was the first REVENGE movie I have ever seen, and I believe this remake hold its own.  The script could have been a little longer and contained a little deeper dialogue, but the action and drama makes up for the shallow parts.

I am a little upset that the DVD only has a few BLOOPERS; The Rock is a funny guy, and I am sure there HAD to be more bloopers during the filming that could have been included on the DVD.

The Audio Commentary by The Rock was absolutely hilarious.  The Rock has a great sense of humor.  He does need to quit calling everyone he know ""My MAN"" though - way too repetitive.  If everyone is ""The MAN"" then no one is ""The MAN.""  Listen to the Rock audio commentary if you want to hear what I mean.

Neal McDonough was an excellent bad guy, but I believe he needed more dialogue added to his character.  He, like The Rock, has a great screen presence and it should have been used more.

The shoot-out at the sheriff's office was a little over-the-edge.  Hundreds and hundreds of shots fired and The Rock and his woman never suffer a hit.  Little hard to believe.

The rest of the extras on the DVD are really good - not as depressing as the Bloopers extra.

HOWEVER, I grew up following the legend of Buford Pusser.  I was a junior in high school when he died in an automobile accident.  He was one person who lived a life with even more adventure and blood and guts than is potrayed by the fictional characters of this film.  This was one time that the film makers should have stayed with reality.

2064619,5,B000274T94,"I went out last night and bought this DVD which released this past Tuesday.  By the end of the movie, I was very impressed. I, unfortunately, never got the opportunity to see ""Walking Tall"" in the theatre a few months ago, so I was pretty shocked after I watched it, because critics reviews on the movie weren't exactly 5 star.
I only have a few complaints, which I'll get to a little bit later on.  But for the positive points, I have to say Dwayne Johnson really had me believing he was Chris Vaughn, and out to save his hometown from what it had become after he had left.  His acting in this movie made the movie that much more enjoyable.  This guy is going to be even bigger then he is in a few years, if he sticks with acting.
I was also impressed with Neal McDonough, who plays a pretty convincing villian by the name of Jay Hamilton. His performance in the movie matches up with Dwayne's, which makes a great fight scene near the end of the movie.
The climax of the whole movie was during the huge fight scene, which I mentioned above that happened between Neal's character and Dwayne's character.  Now on to Johnny Knoxville, who plays Ray Templeton, Chris' best friend.  Johnny comes across as witty, yet plays off his character very well.
Ashley Scott plays Deni in the movie, who is also Chris' love. I was pretty impressed with her acting, although one thing that I didn't like was near the end of the movie, Deni is fighting in her red bra.  I'm sure that was for the male audience, but it wasn't needed.  However, I just love the chemistry between Deni and Chris.  Even though they have been apart for eight years, you can tell the first time they see each other they still have those feelings.  I also cannot forget the amazing performance from Chris' family, mainly his father.  I really liked how his dad didn't want to use guns.
The only negative points I have about the DVD is the fact that it doesn't come in full screen (or at least here it doesn't).  I hate widescreen because it takes up half of my television.  Also was very disappointed in the features.
One of them is a good look into the movie, but the rest are very short, and there is not a lot of extras.  I have yet to listen to the comentary, though. The last negative point about the movie was that I did not mind the running time was 86 minutes, but I was disappointed that the R-Rated version was NOT on the DVD, like previously stated it would be. I felt they could have gone more into depth about Chris getting elected as sheriff.  My favourite scene in the movie was the court room scene, which Dwayne's performance in that scene blew me away.  He gets a star just for that scene, itself, which is why I gave the movie 5/5 stars, as the DVD is really worth about 4/5 stars.
Overall though, my impression on ""Walking Tall"" was good.  At the beginning of the DVD, they have written, ""Inspired by a True Story"", which I liked that. The movie made me realize that The Rock is going places and is really developing his acting skills.
If you are a fan of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (or any other cast member for that matter), or if you are looking for just a fun, entertaining hour and a half, I would buy this movie.  I got everything I expected out of it, and even more.",1096675200,,3253,4.322368421052632

This remake of ""Walking Tall"" certainly fits the mold, with the setting being an isolated mill town where corruption runs wild and no one from the outside world, such as the state police or the FBI, would ever think of coming in to clean things up (think of it as a sort of bizarro Shangri-La).

Instead of the legendary Bufford Pusser this time we have the Rock as Chris Vaughn, a Special Forces war hero who returns to his home in the great forests of Washington to find the old mill has closed and his old high school nemesis Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) has opened up a casino where the games are crooked, there are drugs to be bought, and the local sheriff and his men are just more paid muscle.  Hamilton treats Vaughn and his friends to a night at the casino, which ends up with our hero trying to beat up all of the security thugs.  But since it is early in the film there are too many of them and they not only take Vaughn down, one of them decides to start carving up our hero.

This particular scene ends up being the fatal flaw in this movie.  We are not exactly sure what this guy is doing to Vaughn until a key moment in his trial.  There is a trial because since the police will not do anything about what happened to him our hero decides to take matters into his own hands.  Actually in his hands he has a 2 x 4, having rejected a shotgun for a more personal touch.  Vaughn is put on trial and in a scene that saves 15-30 minutes of story development ends up defending himself, ripping open his shirt, and getting elected sheriff, all in the course of about two minutes.  The problem is that the brutal violence of having sliced up Vaughn's chest is at odds with the rather cartoonish violence of the rest of the film.  Within the context of the revenge genre film you would expect the man who carved up Vaughn to pay for his dirty deed in some significant way, but he pretty much goes out with a whimper.

In one of the special features on the DVD we learn that the point of this remake was not so much to honor the life of Bufford Pusser but to make a film where the action (read violence) is back to basics.  No wire work with people flying through the air, but your basic guy with a 2 x 4 beating up on people; and not just any 2 x 4, but one with a specially made handle so you can really put your weight into it.  Now, I have no problem with this approach and director Kevin Bray certainly sets up some entertaining fights along these lines.  But they seem somewhat inappropriate given the set up with the chest cutting, as does the film's humor.

The Rock is certainly an engaging action star with a likeability that I usually do not find in this genre.  He has a nice sense of humor that works in several scenes throughout ""Walking Tall,"" although, again, the idea that you can have a comic scene of Vaughn recooperating from having his chest cut to ribbons strikes me at least extremely odd if not outright wrong.  The other surprising performance in the film is from Johnny Knoxville of ""Jackass"" fame who plays Vaughn's old high school pal Ray Templeton, who becomes one of the deputies to the new sheriff; the fact Ray has a felony drug conviction is no barrier to employment as Vaughn fights fire with fire.  There is a scene where Ray has to stop being a clown and fight back and he does so credibly.  One thing about films with the Rock, they usually have a co-star who turns in a surprisingly good performance as well.

Fans of the Rock and this genre should like ""Walking Tall"" just fine.  But that one bit with the chest and the great leap forward in the trial scene bother me enough that it has to cost ""Walking Tall"" a star.",1096588800,4,4103,4.313802083333333
2064621,3,B000274T94,"I think critics were too hard on this movie. I think because they hate when a movie is advertised with ""based on a true story"". I honestly think the movie shouldn't have been advertised with that...no movie should. It takes the fun out of them and plus this is about as realistic as a Steven Seagal movie. Although it's much better than a Steven Seagal movie though. After knocking the movie for that I can't think of any other way that it's actually bad.

  The Rock shines in a more serious role for him although he  still kicks ass and has fun in the role. His character  is a new sheriff who walks around with a big club to try and take control of the town he once grew up in. Helping him bring order to the town and bring down criminals is his friend who..used to be a criminal. He's well played by Jonhy Knoxville surprisingly and Knoxville makes for a fun partner for the Rock. Although I liked the Rundown much more than this, I still don't think this was a bad movie. Plus the Rock still has a more promising acting career than fellow wrestler Hulk Hogan. This is also much better than any film Hogan ever made.

He comes back to find it closed and goes to see his parents home. He learns that the main industry now is a casino owned by his one time friend, but trouble starts when Rock finds out that the casino is crooked and so is the people who protect it.

This movie plays out like an after school morality movie on drugs. The acting and the script are subpar. Of course that's typically the way movies based on morality are. But then one has to question a movie that glorifies a character who uses illegal means to punish immoral people.

Of course, just like any movie based on a moral principle the movie is kind of dry and predictable. Good action though, but not enough reason to go out and rent or buy the movie in my opinion.

If you want action, humor, and fun buy this movie, don't rent it, you'll thank me for it.  The only reason it gets a 4 star rating is the fact that it has a fight scene where they beat the crap out of each other and keep going....doesn't cut it with me.

2064633,1,B000274T94,"There is a particularly disturbing scene in Barry Blaustein's brilliant wrestling documentary ""Beyond the Mat"", which haunted me ever since I saw the film. No, it's not the messed up personal life of Jake 'the Snake' nor is it the sight of Mick Foley's children screaming in terror as he receives repeated chair shots to the head. It was Vince McMahon expressing his interest in ""making movies........."" which put the chill down my spine.
Traditionally 'wrestling movies', that is wrestling themed films, have being unsuccessful at the box office and pretty terrible, the only exception being ""The One and Only"" which is a great film (possibly due to the fact that it's star isn't a wrestler). I'm a long time wrestling fan and can admit that 'sports entertainment' will never ever work as well in the cinema as it does in the tv soap opera format. The obvious logic therefore is to make films starring wrestlers, but not strictly on the subject of wrestling. Rowdy Roddy Piper scored the starring role in John Carpenter's ""They Live"", a solid cult classic by any standard, why couldn't this formula work?
Enter The Rock! The most electrifying man in sports entertainment! If any wrestler had the look and charisma to carry a feature film, it is the great one. At least in theory..............
""The Scorpion King""? That was so bad, it made ""Conan the Destroyer"" look like ""Conan the Barbarian""! ""The Rundown""? The brilliant script for that film manages some near impossible tasks, it makes Seann ""Stiffler"" William Scott painfully unfunny, Christopher Walken pathetic (Tooth Fairy speech!?), presents The Rock as the cliched 'hero with tragic past' type character without provide a shred of backstory (why won't he use guns?) and to top it all off in a moronic attempt to inject depth and a social conscience into the shallow garbage, it rips off a scene straight out of ""Powaqqatsi""! The action scenes are rather bad (HollyWood will never EVER come close to Asian films in action, no matter how many sellout choreographers they bribe in from Hong Kong!!!) and the film runs 15 minutes too long.
So what about ""Walking Tall""? Unfortunately it's just another over-hyped horrible Hollywood remake. Is that all they do? put out terrible remakes of great films, ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""The Ring"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Planet of the Apes"" etc, etc. Haven't they already used the original ""Walking Tall""? 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan? In a recent episode of Raw, The Rock was doing Mick Foley's 'This Is Your Life' during which a ""critic"" told Rocky ""if you'd shown this much vitality, maybe 'Walking Tall' wouldn't be a walking piece of crap!"", I'm not sure why that line of dialogue was scripted, simply because it is a dead right observation! Of course this won't stop J.R.'s endless plugging, how many wrestlers have being ""walking tall"" on their way to the squared circle lately?
I want The Rock to succeed, sincerely want his films to be good, he's one of my favorite wrestlers along with Mysterio and Flair. The Rock on the mike is brilliant, in fact better than brilliant, he's electrifying! The Rock on talk shows is charming, funny and totally entertaining. So why is the magic missing from every film he's in?
The answer is simple, The Rock has a ton of charisma and personality, but sadly is not a highly skilled actor. Sure his promos are some of the tightest in sports entertainment, but outside The Rock persona, he doesn't have much of a range. This is in no way a mean spirited insult, just the honest truth. But many of the most respected actors play only one character repeatedly, Robert DeNiro for example. So what is wrong with letting The Rock play the Rock? Why force him into stiff uncomfortable cliched hero roles? Why not make a movie, or better yet a series of movies, in the James Bond style with The Rock as a secret agent putting the smackdown of the bad guys and getting a Bond sized share of pie along the way? A series of ""Shaft"" style films with The Rock jive talking the jabroni's and swinging with allot of groovy pie in the process? There is no reason why The Rock 'as is' cannot be placed in any number of films. That would be giving fans what they want, lets face it, most of the audience who went to see the films so far didn't go because the plot interested them, they went to see The Rock, I went to see The Rock.
Real wrestling fans should avoid these movies, don't give them your money because if they are successful The Rock will continue to be cast in pure crap like ""Walking Tall"", rather than either being forced to return to wrestling, which would not be a bad thing at all, or force producers/directors/writers to drastically increase the quality of the films, like that will ever happen.",1085443200,4,4728,4.732121212121212

2064635,3,B000274T94,"""Walking Tall"" is a remake of a much older movie, which is based on a true story. After seeing this version, I am not so certain that I would want to see the older one.
The Rock had a hit in his last film last September, ""The Rundown."" He was even good in that movie, and I felt that he would become the newest action star. The actor that will make many action movies, they will all hit number one, and make tons of money. After watching ""Walking Tall,"" I am starting to doubt that. It wasn't really that good of a movie, but it was good for what it was. I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the theatres unless you are a true action buff.
The main problem with ""Walking Tall"" is that it is about 81 minutes, but with credits and all it probably only hits about 75 minutes. The lenght is not the problem, but it is the content inside of it. There are many scenes that are just useless, and I have no idea why they are even included in the movie. It took a while for the plot to open up, and after thinking it would be more exciting, they throw in more useless scenes. I kept waiting for those scenes to influence the rest of the movie, but it did not.
The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn. Chris comes back to him hometown and he finds that everything is changing around him. The successful lumber yard has been changed into a casino that is run by his rival Jay Hamilton. He sees his parents, his younger sister, and her son Pete. He sees his friend Ray, and the two then go check out the casino. Chris sees a striptease from his ex-girlfriend Deni, leaves embarrassed, and then sees a craps dealer using a pair of dice that are fixed. Chris tells the guards, but it turns into a physical fight that leaves Chris wounded. Christ then finds out that the casino dealers are also dealing drugs to the kids in town, and he gets even more angry when he finds out that Pete is doing drugs. This leads to a violent trip to the casino, leaving many things shattered. He becomes under arrest, and at the trial he vows that if he is innocent, he will run for sheriff and bring good to the two. That is exactly what happens, and from that moment on, Chris decides to get rid of the wrong that has invaded his town.
""Walking Tall"" is not a bad film, but it is also not a good one. I enjoyed it for what it was. It was entertaining, but even though it was 81 minutes, it should have had more development, and more story instead of the dull, pointless scenes that they decided to show. This could have been better as a made for tv movie, or even direct to video. If you want a movie where The Rock is in a good action movie, see ""The Rundown"" which is not on video and DVD.

2064636,4,B000274T94,"I didn't see the 1973 original version of this, but at any rate, this is a great movie. The Rock plays Chris Vaughn, a man who had been fighting the war for some eight years and had planned to return home to Kitsap County, Washington, only to discover that it's not the same city. The city's main source of revenue, the sawmill (where Chris intended to come back and work), had been closed, his nephew is strung out on drugs, and the new main attraction is his once friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough)'s casino, which turns out to be crooked.
Chris gets brutally attacked at the casino and nearly dies, and he tries to press charges without much luck. He is then determined to clean up the city. ""Big deal; that's nothing new,"" you say? Well, that may be true, but the way in which he cleans things up is interesting. It's also interesting to see Johnny Knoxville playing Chris' best friend because it does give him some credibility as a real actor, especially if you're not a fan of MTV's show Jackass (or if you're one of the few people that saw the movie Deuces Wild).
The only problem I had with this movie is something that a lot of other reviewers have mentioned: the movie is too short. If you don't count the endless previews that are shown before all movies, this movie is barely over an hour long, meaning that some things happened too quickly or, as reviewer Bill Addison said best, some of the scenes might still be lying on the cutting room floor.

2064641,3,B000274T94,"The Rock returns in his latest action film, ""Walking Tall"", that's supposedly based on true events, but, isn't (names, events, and places have been changed, so, what's so true about it?). Its also a remake of the original ""Walking Tall"" (that starred Joe Don Baker as Sheriff Buford Pusser and THAT film was based on true events). ""Walking Tall"" is an easy enough timepasser and overall decent film that, hopefully, will encourage fans of ""The Great One"" to be curious enough to check out the original ""Walking Tall"".
The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn, a retired member of the Special Forces, returning home to be with his family and settle down. But upon his return, Chris finds out that his hometown has changed quite a bit since he left. Drugs have been rampantly sold throughout town, the mill has been closed for five years, unemployment is way up, and the only true moneymaker in town is a casino owned & operated by an old highschool football buddy of Vaughn's, who is crooked as he is corrupt & runs the town with an iron fist. After a gruesome fight at the casino & an even worse beating at the hands of the casino's henchmen, Chris Vaughn won't stand for anymore of the town's monkey crap and before you can say, ""You smell what ""The Rock"" is cookin'?"",  Vaughn runs for election of the town's sheriff (he, of course, wins the position), walks tall and carries a big stick and proceeds to lay the smacketh down on all who have destroyed the town & attempt to bring him and his family down.
The outcome is pretty predictable. I like The Rock in his movies, but, it's the movies themselves that I have a hard time with. With this one it seems everything happened rather quickly (especially when he wins the job as the towns sheriff. Did anyone vote? Couldn't there have been a small subplot dealing with the original sheriff not willing to give up the position so easily or tainted ballots?). The film seems a bit rushed with no real character devlopment between any of the characters (whats the origin of Chris' relationship with Danni, why did Chris originally hangout with Johnny Knoxville's character, whats the real reason why Chris' father won't pick up a gun ever again, etc.). The film screen time can't be more than 80 minutes (I attended the 7:10 pm screening and I was out by 20 minutes to nine (that included, at least, 10 minutes of previews). That makes ""Walking Tall"" the shortest film since ""Men in Black II""!)
The plus side is the characters are likable enough to enjoy. Knoxville gives his best performance to date as Vaughn's, Deputy giving the film some great, funny moments (especially the truck chopping sequence. That was awesome!). The Rock is cool as Chris. He comes off likable as  ""The Average Joe"" trying to make his way in life. The fight scenes are down to earth (no ""Matrix"" style slap fighting, or homo, slomo, ""bullit-time"" action, either). The beginning to ""Walking Tall"" is an homage to ""First Blood"" (the first ""Rambo"" film), from the Northern Mid-West Town the film takes place in, to Chris Vaughn walking the road into town. When the Sheriff's car pulls up to greet Vaughn I was almost expecting Sheriff Teasle to step out of the car and arrest him for vagrancy (the charge that got Rambo arrested for).

One of the big knocks on this film is whether a small town in North Carolina could be that corrupt. I honestly don't know. I live around some small towns and some of them have crooks for cops and bad poloticians. I looked past in the movie because I didn't care about it. It was a fun story.
I liked Ashley Scott who plays Deni in the movie who is love interest. It's great to see Ashley on screen again. I liked her in Birds of Prey it was just a bad show. She is hot in the movie.
I liked this movie a lot. It's more of a guy film. Lots of great action that isn't likely possible to ever happen. Lots of gun fire and explosions. There's also a piece of cedar you like to see get used. It's a fun film and if you can look past the whole town thing it really is a fun movie.",1081209600,8,1613,4.02803738317757
2064645,5,B000274T94,"Are you looking to see a brand new, emotion filled action packed masterpiece? Well, you won't get emotion filled, but with this movie you certaintly will get ""brand new"" and ""action packed"". This movie is getting slammed by critics because it is overly violent (yet ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets great reviews), and I feel that is unjust, because that could direct movie goers away, when this movie should make big money...because it deserves to.
While I'm not saying the movie isn't violent, because it sure as hell is and I sometimes questioned what kept it from getting slammed with an R-Rating, the violence is quite tame when compared to other movies. The Rock pics up some wood and goes into a casion and smacks the crap out of everyone. However, the camera always cuts to the person's back or another part of his body so you can't see the effect. So, you might want to keep this movies away from the 2-year olds, but I know I watched movies like this when I was 5 and I turned out OK.
Also, the movie has humor. I wouldn't call it an action comedy like the Rock's last movie, ""The Rundown"" was, because there isn't THAT much humor. Most of the humor is supplied by Jackass Johnny Knoxville, who steals every scene he's in. I'm a big fan of Jackass and have been p*ssed ever since it got cancelled, but it gave Knoxville more time to do what he's always wanted to do: act. And I was questioning how good of an actor he is before seeing this movie. To my suprise, he is quite good! I couldn't see him in a drama, but as a comic actor, I'd say he's just about as amusing as any Seann William Scott (whom is also quite the funny man).
So, if you're looking for a great, great (and entertaining) movie, I do suggest you ignore the low rating in your paper and check out ""Walking Tall"". And believe me, it's better than ""Hellboy"".",1081123200,,1825,4.370588235294117
2064646,4,B000274T94,"This movie was awesome,I really liked the characters. Also the action was great,It's really cool to see a character with a lot of heart stand up to curruption in a big way.",1081123200,,172,4.40625
2064647,5,B000274T94,This is a wonderful remake/tribute.  Although the main character in this movie is named Chris Vaughn you can feel Buford all over the character.  The Rock did an outstanding job in this role.  And I was actually surprised how close to the original story this movie followed.  God Bless You Buford and god bless you Rock for a great job!,1081036800,,336,4.55
2064648,5,B000274T94,"Seeing the modern-era ""Walking Tall"", I can only say it was a true adrenaline rush!! Being from a small Tennessee town that is riddled with corruption and crooked politics, I can understand the true meaning of the storyline. And for those of you who think the real Buford Pusser (Chris Vaughn, in this film) is an object of untrue heritage, you should visit his hometown and visit some of the locals. Maybe then you will understand just how great a man he was. And for those of you who think small-town corruption is just a fable, I ask that you visit Sneedville, Tennessee, where we are famous for such crooked individuals. This movie is a must-see for everyone!!!!! And just remember that there are small towns that are just as the movie portrays. Take it from me first-hand.",1080950400,,777,4.63768115942029
2064649,4,B000274T94,"I went in thinking there was no way this could match the original movie, but it was actually quite decent.  The Rock's acting skills have grown miles beyond what they were in ""The Rundown"" and I was also surprised at the skills of Johnny Knoxville (who is absolutely hilarious in this movie).
I recommend going to see this as it's a movie you really get into.  You almost get angry about what the villians are doing to the hero (especially knowing this is based on true events), and it's almost a little satisfying when The Rock starts getting revenge.",1080950400,,552,4.565656565656566

8023085,5,B000274T94,"""WALKING TALL"" - The theme of this epic kickass movie is the victory of the underdog.  This triumph of good over evil is based loosely on the true-life story of a Tennessee sheriff during the 1960s.  In this 2004 movie starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he portrays Chris Vaughn Jr., a war veteran who returns home after serving in the special forces.  He finds a corrupt local government and police department.  When his young nephew nearly dies of a drug overdose from drugs made and sold by the town's casino owner, Chris (The Rock) single-handedly (with the help of a cedar beam) demolishes the casino and its security thugs.  After enduring further abuse by his former childhood friend, the casino owner, Chris becomes the new sheriff.  He then fires the corrupt cops and permanently puts the evil club owner out of business and into jail.  Of course this movie is replete with great fist fights and a gun battle.  And the story bears a striking resemblance to the 1989 movie ROADHOUSE, in which the club owner was a ""good guy"".  Other than that, the similarities are obvious. And both movies have deservedly become cult classics.  TRIVIA: There were 3 previous versions of Walking Tall starring Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson.  So far, worldwide, the 2004 Walking Tall movie starring The Rock has earned a profit of 11 million U.S. dollars, and has spawned two sequels starring Kevin Sorbo.  The global success of this franchise is strong and encouraging evidence that the new generation vigorously embraces the ancient  principles of honesty and fair play.",1524096000,,1562,4.871212121212121

Do the filmmakers /really/ believe that this is a one-town-county?",1513555200,,252,4.75

Yeah, the cinematography won't win any awards by today's standards, but the acting and storyline were good--and adherance to the true Buford Pusser story. This version is a piece of crap. Johnny Knoxville--oh jeez--give me a break. I should have been paid to watch this, vs. me pay. Stupid plot, B actors galore, and cummy acting from start to finish. Buy a bag of chips instead.",1510790400,,470,4.674698795180723
