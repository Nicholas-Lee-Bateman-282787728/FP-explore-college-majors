If you are looking for guidance and instruction, you will be terribly disappointed.  What a boring waste!",1385769600,,252,4.837209302325581
7800115,5,1600616682,"I love this Merle Rosen DVD and her other DVD called, ""Acrylic Materials and Techniques for Expressive Printing"".  Both are very informative and she does give the name of the tools that she is using.  The sqeegee thing is called a ""Color Shaper"" and it is made of silicone. IN fact she further states that if you do not have a color shaper, a straight edge scraper will do.
  She uses Yupo paper and mentions its surface and how to use it.  She also mentioned that the 300 pound water color paper is her personal choice over lesser weight watercolor paper for the kind of work she does, which is called ""Expressive"" and it is a very spontaneous approach to collage work and painting.
  I use this DVD as a helpful instruction visual for the college students that I instruct on collage making.  I recomend both her DVD's for anyone intested in basic collage art and helpful for understanding application of the varius acrylic mediums, acrylic paint, other paint additives like irredesence color and what they can do or be used for.  Such as the difference between a glazing medium, a molding paste, and medium gel, interference and irredesence.
Merle Rosen's person comes across as very down to earth and friendly.  A person (in my case a student) who stresses over perfection is be made to feel very much at ease after listening to her application watching this DVD.  Mistakes or the non-intended happen, and Merle Rosen demonstates how to take what was un-intended and make it work.",1293667200,4,1483,4.709302325581396
7800116,1,1600616682,"Love the artists work-HATE the VIDEO.  Hate is a strong word, I think irritated is more like it.  While it's true that Rosen works intuitively, this is perhaps NOT the best way to present instruction on technique.  She vacillates endlessly on where to place her collage elements while not offering details on ratios/sources for finding tools (for instance her squeegee brush which seems ultra-cool).  She does a great job of featuring Golden Paints and there is nothing wrong with that since they are considered one of the best acrylics out there, however, it does beg the question on what the motivation was to produce this DVD. I wouldn't purchase this DVD for instruction.  I wish I could refer to a better one but I haven't found one yet.",1259884800,5,742,4.765625
