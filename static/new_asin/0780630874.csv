36080,3,0780630874,Part 4 is an ok horror movie that has the biggest body count of all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The kids that survived Part 3 are back in school with a new pack of kids that Freddy will tear apart. They don't  last. Freddy easily kills the first two dream warriors and is set to kill  Kristen when Kristen gives her powers to kill Freddy to a new Nightmare  heroine Alice. Freddy is more of a comedian then ever. In my opinion he  cracked one two many one-liners in this film and not enough time trying to  be scary. That is my biggest complaint of this film. It doesn't try to be  scary. It just tries to show us another Freddy film with no real reason to  do so. Alot of the deaths that Freddy commits in this film are quite  original and some are just plain gross(like the cockroach girl). Robert  England and Lisa Wilcox are great as the villain and hero. This film also  has the most gory Freddy kill. You will actually see the soles that Freddy  keeps inside him rip out of the clawed killer.,939254400,2,1006,4.214659685863874

36082,5,0780630874,"No, this is not the best Nightmare film, in my humble opinion(that still belongs to the better-than-ever original). However, Part 4, along with Part 3, are the most ferociously entertaining in the series. Part 4 is  particularly exciting, offering superb effects and set pieces and a surge  of pure adrenaline into the series. Sadly, with the exception of Wes  Craven's excellent New Nightmare, this would be the climax of the horror  saga, as the next installments underperformed at the box office and in  terms of impressing fans. Though no longer in print(still a mystery to me)  there is a rumor that the film will be released along with the other  Nightmares on DVD this Halloween, meaning a video rerelease is inevitable.",928713600,,727,4.958677685950414
36083,4,0780630874,"This chapter goes back to the first Nightmares simplicity with Freddy not being seen much at first and with the second movie showing Freddy looking for a teen to use to help him kill, only this time he seeks that help in the dream world.  As it combines some keen elements of the first 2 NOES movies, it still provides a special direction of its own.  While I wouldn't say that this is the best Nightmare movie in the series, it will always be nostalgic and harboring some sentimental value for me as I saw it when I was a kid.

Freddy has his sights on not only the 3 survivors from part 3 but he has new teens to target and a new adversary named Alice.  This time Freddy is more charismatic and becomes much more of a comedian.  No new info on his past is delved into though.

Freddy shows an interesting side of himself as he sometimes wears disguises and/or blends in to the dream world surroundings at first.  Freddy is taking on teen kids in which just as he did in the last movie, he tries to exploit the teens weaknesses when he can find a way.

Some Facts about the Film:  It was directed by Renny Harlin and produced yet again Robert Shaye and joining him for the first time, Rachel Talalay.  The musical score was done by John Easdale and Craig Safan.  Heron Communications and Smart Egg Pictures are yet again the production company.  Still distributed by New Line Cinema.  It was released to theaters by August 19, 1988.  The production budget was $13 million.  Finally it made $49,369,899 in the box office making it the NOES movie that made the most of the four movies.

It's interesting how much more focused on the teen aspect this chapter proved to be.  At first it has the feel of an episode of the likes of a teen drama like Degrassi Junior High(on the air at the time as far as I know), Rocky Road(same decade) or even like the 90's teen drama My So-Called Life.  I know that this movie came out long before My So-Called Life but still.

There isn't alot of gore in this movie but what you do get is pretty well crafted.  The kills are quite creative and unique however.  The kill where Freddy sucks the breathe out of Sheila proves equal parts disturbing and very creative.  The waterbed death that Freddy did to Joey reminds me fondly of a kill somewhat similar to that in the 1983 slasher Pieces.  Debbie's roach death was creative but also too disturbing.

The special effects used for things like Freddy's chest souls, the roaches, Kristen's power transfer to Alice, Sheila's death, Freddy's defeat and whatnot all proved to feature brilliant special effects.

Kristen(this time played by Tuesday Knight), Sheila, and Debbie all proved to be great eye-candy as they were all mad gorgeous and serious smokin' hotties.  Dan and Rick are both very handsome guys.  Rick and Kristen made one really attractive couple for sure.  Alice, however was just too plain and ordinary to me.

 About the whole Dream Master deal and the powers that follow.  Well if there's one fresh and and cool idea they had for this movie it was the way that Alice somehow gains all of her friends and her brother's personalities and dream powers.  While it was completely clear as to how she gained Kristen's ability to pull others into her dreams(of which Freddy intended to take full advantage of) it was very vague as to how she gained the powers/abilities and personalities of her friends and her brother Rick.  Still it was a cool idea that reminds me of the Highlander movies, in particular the 3rd Highlander movie where we find out that an immortal can kill another and gain not just their intelligence nut if they had any powers; those as well.

Alie's suit up for battle montage with Dramarama's Anything, Anything playing in the background(just as it was when Rick practiced his Kung Fu moves earlier in the movie) was an awesome added touch.  Dramarama were an awesome band and the style as well as weaponry that Alice equipped herself with were very cool.  One special and memorable 80's montage moment in horror history.

Again you get only one scene of nudity but yet again it's a very good one.  Hope Marie Carlton proves very hot in the brief time that she appears in the waterbed death scene.

I loved the look and presentation of the Kung Fu inspired scene where Rick is fighting Freddy is really cool looking and well thought out.  Also, it was an interesting idea to use for the movie with the Kung Fu idea and Freddy's Kung Fu jokes while invisible.

Overall, as this isn't the best NOES movie, it still carries that wonderful 80's horror/slasher bit of nostalgia and it has some memorable moments in terms of the teen kids, the kill scenes, the soundtrack, and finding more Springwood teens with special kinds of personality, smarts, and dream powers or strengths for Freddy to grapple with.  Also after the unfortunate death of Nancy Freddy gets a new adversary named Alice.  The visuals and special effects weren't as great as in the previous 3 but were still quite excellent on their own.  The whole gaining the power, strength, and intelligence of ones dead friends was a fresh and cool idea.  81/2 stars 10.",1477440000,,5133,4.580043859649122
36084,4,0780630874,"Okay, I am going to be quite honest - this movie scared me as a kid! I would peek through the curtains (as my dad watched it) & I would end up keeping my parents awake for nights on end. Too afraid to go to sleep just in case Freddie decided to pay me a visit!!!

M-Net premiered it a while back and I watched it again and --- nada!

I was questioning myself about WTF happened to make me s*** scared in the first place? I looked at my daughter and noticed her totally fazed out by the infamous Freddie Krueger with shut eyes and blocked ears! I did not sleep well for a week!!!",1473292800,,578,3.9741379310344827

The whole weightlifting/fly trap kill was great and there were a few other good effects used, that scene when the souls of the children come back out of Freddy and rip his jaw off was pretty awesome. I also liked how they set it up making you think Kristen (Tuesday Knight) and her friends are going to be the main focus when it's really Alice (Lisa Wilcox).

 Really surprised a fourth movie in a franchise could be as good as The Dream Master was.",1463702400,,587,4.327272727272727

36087,4,0780630874,"After some time in the mental hospital, Kristen, Kincaid and Joey have been released from Westin Hills and are living lives as normal teenagers. When Kristen, starts believing Freddy is coming back, she ends up and summons Joey and Kincaid into her dreams, she pisses them off by doing so and they warn her that dreaming of Freddy might actually cause his return and to stop. The next day, Kristen picks up her boyfriend, martial arts enthusiast Rick Johnson, and his sister which is Kristen's best friend, Alice.
After arriving at the school she meets with her other friends: Sheila, who is a complete genius and asthmatic; and Debbie, a tough girl who doesn't like bugs, and freaks out about them.  Alice starts daydreaming of her crush Dan Jordan recognizing her, but she snaps out of it when Rick teases that he can introduce them.
That night, Kristen stays awake to keep from dreaming, but Kincaid falls asleep and awakens in a junkyard where his dog Jason innocently resurrects Freddy from his grave. Trapped, Kincaid tries to fight off Freddy with his strength, but Freddy rebounds and kills Kincaid instead. Freddy then tricks Joey into thinking a model is swimming in his waterbed, but Freddy attacks him, drowning out his dream power and stabbing him with his razor sharp fingers for his mother to find the next morning. At school, Kristen panics when she notices Joey and Kincaid missing and is knocked out. She is nearly attacked by Freddy when the school nurse wakes her up. Kristen tells Rick, Alice, and Dan about Freddy's legacy before her mother Elaine shoos the three of them away from the run down about Krueger house (that b****). At dinner, Kristen notices her mother had slipped her sleeping pills, and she falls asleep before calling Alice. Taking her advice on dreaming, Kristen tries to dream of someplace fun, but Freddy invades and forces Kristen back to his home. Being the last of the Elm Street children, Freddy tricks Kristen into calling on one of her friends, so that his fun can begin a new reign on killing and taunting. Kristen calls Alice into her dream, and Freddy ends up killing Kristen by throwing her into his boiler. Waking up and sensing something wrong, Alice takes Rick to Kristen's house, only to see her burning to death in her bedroom.
Later, Alice falls asleep during class and not knowing it she brings Sheila into her dream. Freddy literally sucks the air from Sheila's lungs, making it look like shes having an asthma attack and she dies. Rick starts to believe his sister, but the next day he has a martial arts inspired dream and is ultimately killed when Freddy cheats in one-on-one combat (go figure).
Can Alice save her friends from Freddy?
Can she beat him once and for all?
To find out you should really watch this movie. Its a really great movie.

36090,3,0780630874,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is just about on the level of 2 and 3 (mediocrity), which basically is a mediocre movie with surprisingly few scares. Yes, Freddy is in top form here, but that's the only real highlight. I'm not a big fan of excessive special effects in horror movies, either. In some ways, this feels like a sci-fi movie. If you're going to make a horror film, keep the lasers to a minimum! Also, this movie gives John Carpenter's The Thing a run for its money when it comes to the gore. And if you like 80's music (I do for the most part), this movie provides plenty, along with the 'big hair.' Overall, this fourth installment doesn't resonate when it comes to being dark or suspenseful. The three stars I'm giving it are generous.",1447027200,,745,4.405797101449275

36092,5,0780630874,"I consider Nightmare on Elm Street 4 the second best behind the original film. It's directed by Renny Harlin, and it's made with a lot of style and memorable nightmares. It is also the most financially successful installment of the series.

I remember watching this as a kid. I eagerly awaited Halloween as that seemed to be the only time they would show 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' movies on TV, and I looked forward the most to Part 4 (an aside, streaming services ruin the anticipation and waiting to watch things, but they serve their purposes). I wanted to get my trick-or-treating done as fast as I could so I could get home and watch this in time. I would always end up watching the second half, but eventually saw the entire thing and it made a lasting impression.

I do suggest you watch all the 'Nightmare' movies in order, as it does have some continuity of characters, at least in parts 3, 4, and 5. It's not a biggie, but it will help you understand the first nightmare in this movie. At the very least, watch Part 3.

Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is a colorful, fun, and scary movie. The nightmares range from weird, to gross, to shocking, as the stuff of nightmares tend to be. Watching as an adult I would say Part 4 is where the series peaked. This movie had the best of everything: the best soundtrack (save for the original's score), the best cinematography, and some of the best nightmares of the series. One nightmare involving working out and bugs may forever remain in your memories as it did mine.

It's always recommended that you watch these movies late at night, with very little lights on, to help set the mood; you'll have some good old scary fun. Recommended.",1446508800,2,1686,4.5

36101,3,0780630874,"watched a nightmare on elm street part 4: the dream master for the first time in years. now, this is a movie i saw a trillion times when it was released; i guess that's how long it took me to see it for the piece of junk that it is. but it's fun junk, and i really enjoy alice and her struggles. once again, we get a tightly knit group of teens who circle up and attempt to withstand another (contrived) krueger assault. i can't believe that they still trot out the old ""elm street children"" thing. let freddy just kill for the sake of killing. i certainly don't need a reason. the kids are really likeable, a motley crew made from all of the school's social castes, as well as entertaining holdovers from part 3, kincaid and joey. it's a bummer that patricia arquette didn't return as kristen (i can't imagine why), but tuesday knight gives it her best shot, and she does just fine.

dream master has some great visual effects, and, honestly, it seems that the movie is filled with them, wall to wall. the make-ups are excellent, and mention must be made of kevin yaghers excellent work, as well as steve johnson, and screaming mad george. there are some great gags, not the least of which is brooke thiess' (heather langenkamp's sister on just the ten of us) kafka-esque metamorphosis. freddy is as far from dark here as possible, delivering one liner after one liner, and only occasionally mustering a bit of menace. but robert is having fun, and he is in total command of the character. the dialogue throughout this film is utterly terrible, and is often distracting. but the music is good, the kills nifty, and a sense of good fun permeates everything in this terrible, entertaining flick.

A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 was also the highest grossing flick of the week when it was released in the Summer of 1988 and this sequel ranked #1 during its theatrical release on Friday August 19,1988 along with the fact that A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET IV was also the highest grossing horror flick of 1988 which was also the year when HALOWEEN IV:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS and FRIDAY THE 13TH:PART 7-THE NEW BLOOD were released too which made 1988 a great year for terror flick releases.

As a matter of fact; HALLOWEEN 4 did very well at the box office during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1988 and FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII didn't do to shabby at the box office either during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1988.

It's also almost as if this 4th sequel also inspired the release of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V:THE DREAM CHILD & FRIDAY THE 13TH: PART 8-JASON TAKES MANHATTAN in the Summer of 1989 and HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1989.

36128,5,0780630874,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 may not be considered the best film of the entire series by many critics (that is usually reserved for the first), but it is by far the most fun, as it takes the schlockiness of all the sequels and runs with it completely without taking itself too seriously as the rest try so hard to do (even though they all work well in their own unique way). It works stupendously and is a film I consider an absolute classic of all 80s nostalgia. It is intentionally campy, and works all the more for it.
Nightmare 4 continues after the third bringing back the 3 remaining survivors from the teenager's mental ward from the last film (namely, Joey, Kincaid, and Kristen). This time, Kristen's character is no longer played by Patricia Arquette but instead newcomer Tuesday Knight, who also performs many of the songs for the soundtrack (including 'Nightmare,' which plays in the opening scene, and is easily one of the best horror movie songs of the entire 80s decade, if not, THE best). This time around, since Freddy returns and kills Kristen, she has to hand over her powers in a dream to her friend, Alice (who is also played by beautiful newcomer Lisa Wilcox and plays her part so incredibly well that she's the type of girl every teenage and twenty-something guy will easily fall in love with). Alice in the film transitions from a shy nerdy girl to a totally bombastic a**-kicking gorgeous heroine by the end, which is just a great and charming story writing element in this film, you'd wish it was done in the same way as others. Yet she is just a start of what is quite simply the BEST Nightmare on Elm Street cast in the entire series. Look for the 'Alice gets ready' scene just before she has the final confronation with Freddy by the end, which I consider one of the best 'getting ready' and best scene montages in all of cinema, you simply want to get up and cheer hoorays for our heroine, Alice.

Alice's power is that she can bring people into her dreams, and whenever there is another murder by Freddy Kreuger, she inherits a portion of their personality and inner talents. There is also another element in her power called the DreamMaster, a sort of spirit that one can call to within a dream which helps Alice's power at the end of the film. Contrively enough, all we know of this spirit is that its origins are in a nursery rhyme, yet nothing beyond this is ever told as to give the audience a reason why these particular teenagers (Kristen, Alice, and even Nancy in the original and third films) hold so much unique power. This power and its origins are not really investigated or explored very much in the film (or at all) but it would have been cool to learn more about why they exist.
Returning as always is Robert Englund as Freddy Kreuger and this would be the first official movie where Freddy becomes the sort of Saturday Morning cartoon character that he has become so well known for. While he did hint at such a sense of humor in the third film, this is the first time it is done to a level of campiness not done before (I personally would not consider the third film all that campy as it does try hard to be a serious entry in the Nightmare series, given it was written by Wes Craven). Again, he does an incredible job, and is given some pretty funny and memorable lines.

Rounding out the new cast are Alice's brother Rick, a good looking and fun karate athlete who also is dating Kristen; her friend Sheila, the smart nerdy girl who rides a scooter to school; friend Debbie, a tough-as-nails work-out guru with some of the most awesome 80s big hair ever; and new friend Dan, the hunky jock love interest of Alice. Their relationships and general characterization aren't really explored too much either, and we are mostly simply told that most of them (not all) are established friends. While it may be argued that this is a negative, giving these people too much personality would take away from the campiness and general fun of what the movie as a whole is meant to be.

So why does the movie work? It's just so intentionally, and at other times, unintentionally, fun. There are things that are put in for sake of special effects and plot that don't really make sense, but since the film is so obviously created for fun and campiness, these factors can be excused. For example, in one scene, Alice, Dan and Debbie all decide to meet up one night to talk about a plan. Alice agrees to meet Dan at a local Diner, so even though Dan gets there, he doesn't wait because Alice was held up at home by her alcoholic father (which is a pretty decent side plot on its own). She gets there to find Dan isn't around, so instead she goes to a local movie theater to watch an old movie to pass the time?? She falls asleep at the theater in order to advance the plot as she is thrown into another Freddy nightmare. It's somewhat silly but does make for a cute and creative scene with some pretty impressive special effects (even for today). Of course Dan appears within her dream because it is told they both fell asleep... but where was Dan when Alice got to the Diner and if he was alseep why weren't him or his truck around? See, a sort of plot hole that can be excused because, well, this is a campy 80s film. I personally didn't mind. Fanatics like myself will appreciate how cute Alice looks as she digs away at her popcorn as if there is nothing wrong at all in the world. Not to also mention that admist all the chaos going on she still takes the time to go to the concession stand to order that popcorn and a pepsi fountain drink.

Anyway, at the end of the film we get a final confrontation that compeltely blows away all the Freddy deaths in all the films, even the final Freddy death in the last nightmare movie, 'Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.'

So due to a campy fun feel, a charming and completely likable and attractive cast, Robert Englund's always excellent Freddy performance, unique plot ideas, a great 80s soundtrack, and highly impressive special effects for its time, and the most creative deaths in the entire series (not to also mention the most deaths by count), Nightmare 4 is the film that I would consider the best film in the series as well as a very nostalgic and entertaining film of the 80s decade.",1355961600,3,6271,4.459059233449477

36131,3,0780630874,"The first Nightmare On Elm Street film was an excellent horror flick and is a classic or the genre, it introduced Freddy Krueger as one of the most memorable villains and its concept of a child killer killing teenagers in the dreams was an interesting concept and one that worked well at that, it stood the test of time. When a movie is successful there's often the temptation of trying to reproduce that success with a sequel and sometimes it just doesn't work. Case in point: Freddy's Revenge which was a poor sequel and even messed with the original a little and was just an embarrassment. Dream Warriors was intended to be the third and last Nightmare film, the goal was to end as a high note and lay the character to rest. It's probably the best sequel and added backstory to the original along with returning cast and goes back to what made the first film so great. When Dream Warriors was well received and a success came the opportunity to make another sequel and being that horror films are cheap to make and can generate big revenues, a fourth Nightmare flick was made. Dream Master is bit like taking a step back after the step forward that was Dream Warriors. It's entertaining and enjoyable however, it continues on the third film's story and does so reasonably well and doesn't end up a total flunker like the second film, it was even the biggest of the series at the box office. To its credit Dream Master is entertaining and has some of the most creative/entertaining kills of the series and the idea for the script was actually not a bad one.

Three of the teenagers from Dream Warriors are still alive and Freddy is after them. One of the survivors, Kristen, who was introduced in the previous film has nightmares about Freddy again and she starts pulling people into her dream and as usually happens Freddy goes after the teenagers one by one. Kristen could summon people into her dreams, that was her gift but soon enough Freddy gets to the survivors and eliminates them one by one. For the franchise to continue there needs to be new victims, before dying Kristen passes on her powers to Alice, and it's her and her friends who become tormented by Krueger who can continue to exist once more. I thought that whole idea made sense and was rather good as far as horror logic and continuation goes.

One thing that's noticeable immediately is that Kristen who we first met in Part 3: Dream Warriors is back although Patricia Arquette is no longer playing the role which was given to Tuesday Knight. That was a bit misleading but for continuation purposes it made sense to bring back the character of Kristen who was seen as the new Nancy. I think Arquette made a better Kristen but Knight is not horrible and has a certain appeal to her. They even brought back two other characters from the previous film. The way Krueger is killed is in this one left a little something to be desired, it wasn't awful and probably not the worst way he died in the series but it wasn't totally convincing is how I would put it. After the original Nightmare its sequels introduced more comedy elements and give more of the funny one-liners to Freddy which worked well to a certain degree. Other than some interesting kills, Dream Master is content being almost near comedy territory; it's as if not trying to be as scary anymore and this would only increase with the next sequels.

Dream Warriors tied things nicely and was a fitting ending; it went back to origins and had purpose which was ending Freddy and the nightmares for good. Dream Master doesn't work as well because it continues the story but doesn't reveal that much more, it's just an entertaining slasher flick that keeps the party going a little longer (not that there's anything wrong with that). It's certainly not a bad Nightmare and is one of the better and more watchable sequels, other than the fact that an actress who played one of the key characters has been replaced, the story and the film itself are actually good. I feel it's from here that the sequels became less intense and inspired, it almost serves as a link between the first three films and the ones that followed (except the 2010 remake and 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare which is really more of a stand alone film and not a continuation). It's a less scary, thrilling nightmare, a bit lighter and more comedy thrown in. It's not a letdown and its actually one of the best sequels only this time around things are a little too lose and predictable. A product of its time of course that ends up being a good 80's slasher flick. 3  stars",1345075200,2,4574,4.5676004872107185

Patricia Arquette, who had the lead role in ""Part 3"", refused to be in this outing so her character was replaced by another actress.

 Freddy continues to be scary as ever, the teens (some of whom are just plain awful in the acting department) meet their ultimate demise thank God and you, for some reason, root for Freddy!

36133,3,0780630874,"This movie, while not as good as A Nightmare on Elm Street or Dream Warriors, was still a pretty good movie. It is a direct follow-up of Dream Warriors, featuring the surviving characters from Dream Warriors at the same time as Nightmare III left off. This movie is darker than the previous film, where Freddy seemed to take on a more comedic side. It was a different change, and a delight to watch, but it's nice to have Freddy go a little darker in this movie. Although the humour is still there (and this is just my opinion) it's not as strong as in Dream Warriors, which makes it an all right movie.
I do, however, have a few problems with watching this movie. As a Christian person (with a love for horror... odd mix!) I find this movie very religiously blatant. The famous children's prayer ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep..."" is used in this movie when the children go o sleep, but it is blasphemiously changed, so the characters say this: ""Now I lay me down to sleep, the master of dreams, my soul I'll keep...""
Apart from that, it's a great movie, great casting, great acting (Robert Englund, duh!) and great storyline. I particularly love how this film continues where A Nightmare III left off, unlike, for example, Nightmare II in which Jessie was never seen again.
However, it is disappointing that *ELM STREET III SPOILER* Heather Langencamp's character Nancy Thompson was killed off at the end of Dream Warriors. It was truly sad to see him go.
This movie is more entertaining than the first and second films, but not as good as Nightmare III. This is the second best of the films (so far, I'm writing reviews for all the Nightmare films, and of the ones I've done, this is second best).",1344124800,,1730,4.477848101265823
36134,5,0780630874,"So here it is for me folks.......the most magic and entertaining film  I've seen as a kid and that magic and fantasy were never equalled again in the ""Freddy""  film series !!!! This film marks the beginning of a long and magical tour in the horror/fantasy genre; this is where everything began for me.

Of course i realize that we're back in 1988, i was only 6 years old at the time and i know that we are far from the budget and kind of special effects that a film like that would have if it was produced today. But still, the level of entertainment and fantasy and horror we have in this film is FAR, VERY FAR from everything that got released in the last few years in terms of horror!!!... This film also marks the beginning of a very popular tendency to have an Heroine in the main role instead of a hero, it took a long time and a few flops but slowly, we began to see more women's  in the main role. Movies of today like RESIDENT EVIL or KILL BILL definitely have THE DREAM MASTER  as Grand Father...lol..........(I'm wondering what Quentin would think about that one.....)

THE DREM MASTER is the sequel  to NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 - DREAM WARRIORS which involves Kristen, Joey and Kincaid. Fortunately, you don't really need to watch the 3rd one first if you want to understand what is going on in the 4th one...( personally, i would still recommend it for more fun but...) During the 3rd one (Dream Warrior),  they get interned into a mental institution and are trying to get rid of their anxiety and their fear of Freddy by fighting him in their dream with everything they got. When the 4th one starts, they've already been released from the institution and are now living normal lives and are going to school...

Kristen is the first one to start having nightmares about Freddy again  and about how he's not dead yet and might probably come back. Of course Joey and Kincaid think she's crazy as they thought they got rid of him during the 3rd film. But they will soon discover that they were wrong and that Freddy is about to come back haunting their nightmares until they are all dead!! Only this time, Freddy has a real opponent!!!.........Alice!!!.....

Alice is a frequent  daydreamer and has the ability to control her dreams, but there is also something else...something strong...some kind of inner relation with Freddy himself.... Alice will also get the abilities, strength and special features that everyone that gets kill by Freddy, once he collected their soul after killing them, their abilities get transferred directly into Alice, making her a very powerful opponent for the final challenge!!!!!!

The story may seem ordinary for some people but i believe it is a MUST SEE for everyone!!!! Special  and spooky effects are present through the whole Movie!!!!! The acting is good..very good!!..Nothing  cheesy or anything. Alice is a true heroine!!! A real character with awesome abilities!!! The dreams and nightmares in this movie are just totally crazy!!! Will sometimes make you feel like your on drugs...(even if your not...lol)...Definitely  beyond expectations and way better than any other Freddy Movies I've seen in everyway...and I've seen them all!!!!! The cinematography is unique and even though everything is digital now, the remastered version here is nothing but a dream for your eyes!!!! The soundtrack is amazing and portrays perfectly the 80's and their unique musical style, extremely diverse too!!!

Overall, this is a movie you have to see!!! Alice is a real heroine in there and will please any horror/fantasy fans. She's part of my artistic culture, just like Carol Ann was in POLTERGEIST (Heather O Rourke). This movie is pure magic for me, i loved it the first time i saw it back in 1988 and im still crazy about today. Give it a try and see what i mean...you'll be in for a hell of a ride!!!!!...the only thing i don't like is that red cover...its so simple...i much prefer the old cover they had for it, you can see it on the VHS version of the movie only.

This film is not a total waste as there are good special effects and a few thrills here and there and you can at least get through this one without falling asleep due to constant boredom. And although they do the best they can with the script they have, the cast of characters here are not up to par with the previous film's cast which sinks this film a little more and i do believe that this would be the last halfway decent Nightmare movie until New Nightmare as the quality of the series has begun to slip here and would only get worse for the next couple of movies.

The pros

Englund really brings it as Freddy once again. His performance as Freddy is great as in all the films. I really liked the story line and plot as well. I'd say this is one of the better written films. Better than part 2,5 or 6. Has some of the most imaginative kills in the entire franchise. I liked most of the actors who did a great job. The surviving actors from part 3 return as well. This film has some of the better music of the films. At least two songs play that fit it very well. I also really liked the character of Alice. She's my favorite next to Nancy. I felt that Alice is one of the most developed characters in the film series. The vhs version has a small interview with the director. Not long,but it did shed some insight into what he was trying to do.

The cons. Some of what I say could be thought of as spoilers. Here is your warning.

This film is really toned down compared to the three that came before it. It doesn't even try to be a horror film. The director has even said in interview that he wasn't trying to make it scary. They kill off the surviving characters in the first part of the film. It would have been cool to let them live. I hated how Freddy dies at the end. Has to be one of the weakest ways he gets killed in any of the films. Couldn't they have though of something better. This film is were the series really jumped the shark. 3 had Freddy being more goofy than the others,but this film takes it to a new level. Also the blood and gore is toned down greatly from the first film. The actor playing Christen is not the same. I guess they couldn't get the same actor back. It doesn't kill the film,but takes away from it a bit.

My conclusion. Good film and one of the best in the series. Fun to watch and enjoy. However those looking for a horror film or the Freddy from the first film will be unhappy. If you can get past that then you will enjoy this film.",1283904000,4,1968,4.101298701298702

36148,4,0780630874,"By the time A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 4: The Dream Master rolled around, Freddy pretty much became a homicidal bugs bunny. It's hard to believe Freddy was once actually quite scary. Now he's all about silly one liners, but it does sort of work. The Dream Master is far inferior to the classic original, but in its own right a fun movie.

Wes Craven's classic was the surprise hit and there was no surprise a sequel was made and while Freddy's Revenge did actually out gross the original it wasn't very well received. But the 3rd part was the biggest surprise and became a huge hit, which launched Freddy Krueger into this huge horror Icon. Elm St. 4 was rushed into production and even had a release date before filming even began.

The Elm St. movies are a lot like the horror of today. A lot rely on CGI and pop culture. The Elm St. series relied on big special F/X and Freddy Kruger would always pop up on MTV. A lot of movies these days are called for the MTV generation. But does anyone even watch that station anymore? Well back when this movie rolled around they did.

The one thing I'll give this movie credit for and the series in particular is the characters are quite likeable. For all the flaws and silly moments I have to say the characters were all fairly good. Even the lesser developed characters in The Dream Master I thought were sort of likeable.

The screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland and Jim & Ken Wheat (both Wheat brothers are credited as Scott Pierce). The screenplay is not gonna win any awards, but it's fairly well written. As a series goes on it does get harder and harder to write. All that could be explored has already been done and you just have to try and write an entertaining movie and to the credit of the writers they did that. The way I feel about the script is the way I feel about the movie; nothing great and sort of forgettable, but entertaining.

Renny Harlin is a director that sparks a lot of debate; for the most part he isn't a very good director, but he did make Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, both were a hell of a lot of fun. Here with The Dream Master he fails as a horror filmmaker. There are no scares and very little in the way of suspense. There isn't a whole lot of creativity, but he does craft an enjoyable movie. To be honest any fairly decent filmmaker could have done this movie. Nothing stands out at all, but again the movie works on an entertaining level.

Ken Sagoes returns as Roland Kincaid and Rodney Eastman also returns as Joey Crusel and both are wasted they both played vital roles in the 3rd installment and are here pretty much to add to the body count and finish off the Elm St. kids. Tuesday Knight (great name or what) steps into the role of Kristen Parker replacing Patricia Arquette.

Normally I dislike when a character is re-casted with a different actor; there are those times when I don't mind, but in general I dislike it. But Tuesday Knight does a solid job as Kristen. To be honest I liked her more than Arquette. Tuesday is only in about half the movie and her death is very anti-climatic. But she does serve her purpose, but I would have liked to have seen her role expanded just a little more.

The one thing I really liked about the movie is the Alice character played by Lisa Wilcox. She's my favorite character in the series. I like just slightly more than Nancy, but the Nancy character did the better installments. Alice starts off as this shy and repressed character and very plain Jane, but still cute. But after each death Alice changes and she goes from a shy, repressed plain Jane to this super sexy kick butt heroine.

Also it's quite clear Robert Englund is having fun in the role of Freddy. Sure he's now pretty much a homicidal bugs bunny with a wise crack, but he is entertaining, but it's still hard to believe the character was once scary.

Some people might wonder why the 4-star review. I'll be the first to admit The Dream Master is in no way a 4-star movie. It's sort of like chewing gum. You chew on it for a while when it has its flavor than spit it out. The Dream Master is a fun movie, but at the end of the day sort of forgettable, but for 90 or so minutes it's an entertaining flick. By no means is this a great movie and again no it's not a 4-star movie in general, but it is entertaining and quite honestly isn't that all that really matters?",1197676800,3,4370,4.33782129742962

This is an ok sequel. Freddy is fun to watch in action as always and there is a pretty good story here, But i was dissapointed in the lack of quality acting in this one [Which is a shame because part 3 had the greatest cast of all the nightmare movies]. This makes for a good weekend movie to watch. Does feature a couple of memorable murder scenes. Fans of the series should be able to endure this one.",1192060800,,664,4.2362204724409445
36150,2,0780630874,"Freddy comes back from the grave and starts killing off a bunch of teens including a kid that looks like Fat Albert.  This is a dark comedy and has some interesting imagery in the style of labrynth but not much.

The scene where the girl gets turned into a roach was disgusting and very creative. There is a scene where one of the guys gets turned into a part of a pizza and then he gets eaten by Freddy, that was funny.

This movie has no plot and has some lame scenes like when one of the kids turns into a karate kid and tries to fight off Freddy (yawn that was boring).

There is not too much violence and gore in this one.  The limited amount of gore in this movie is cheesy.
Also I like how Freddy has funny one liners.  I thought Freddy's Dead was a bit more interesting and wild than this one. I still have yet to see the other Elm street movies but when I do I will give a review on here.",1188518400,,897,3.983240223463687
36151,5,0780630874,"I use to watch this film every night. It's one of those films I never got tired of watching. I connect more with Alice than Nancy. I like Nancy, too, but Alice is more like me, so that's why I connect with her more. I'm pretty happy that we didn't see Alice get killed on-screen like Nancy or even Laurie Strode after so many films. At the end of the 5th film, Freddy is clearly still alive. We don't know if he finally got Alice, but since we never seen it, she's still alive in my eyes. I loved that they brought back Kincaid and Joey. Kincaid is one of my favorite Elm Street characters and Joey was a cutie. Too bad they're both killed off early in the film. I didn't have problem with Tuesday Knight taking over Patrica Arquette's role as Kristen. Both obviously portrayed the character differently, but I never was a huge Kristin fan. I didn't hate her, but I never really cared about her. Her character also meets her end in this film. The new characters have personality and you don't what to see them die, but course they have to. The deaths are some of the best of the series. Debbie's death was one of the most disgusting deaths in horror, and after part 4 there were never any deaths as good as that one or the others from the series. This one has got to have one of the funniest and weirdest Freddy resurrections of the series. A dog's urine? Fire urine at that! The  final battle was awesome.  We never seen anyone prepare to take on Freddy as if they were going to war. The soundtrack is one of the series best. No, the best. We get great pop songs through out the film. A soundtrack would've been cool. Tuesday Knight actually wrote and sung the film's title song. She released two albums, but good luck with finding them on CD. This one was the most successful one until the remake and I can see why. I'm glad many fans supported this film when it was released back in the '80s. Despite being the 4th film, people were not tired of Freddy just yet. My top three favorite NOES films are. A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984), A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master and A Nightmare Street 3: The Dream Warriors. I use to have a huge crush on Dan : )",1174262400,,2166,4.254854368932039
36152,5,0780630874,"this film is really really cool the whole thing reeks of the late 80's vibe and the story is really engaging.  the death scenes are awesome (as always) and freddy is still hilarious.  also there's a dog that urinates fire. seriously homie, how is that not crucial braw?

ok so kristen is out of the mental institution and so are jimmy and kincaid.  the threat of freddy is gone (or so it seems), and all is well with kristen she has new friends who are introduced in this movie (most importantly alice and her new boyfriend doug).  but for some reason kristen is drawn to freddy's dream lair much to the dismay of joey and kincaid who are constantly being pulled into kristen's dreams because she is scared, and so it seems with good reason.  that reason being freddy's back and hungry for more teenage souls (awwww poop).  in this installment of the nightmare on elm street seriese the torch is passed, for kristen joey and kincaid all fall victim to freddy[totally destroying nightmare on elm street 3's legacy :*( ]. but not before kristen can pull her new friend alice into her dream, and give her the gift of being able to pull people into her dreams with a little added bonus.  will alice be able to find a way to vanquish freddy once and for all?

this is my favorite in the series if not simply because it has the only good dramarama song on the soundtrack(i'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills, i'll give you anything you want hundred dollar bills. you know you wanna sing along everytime you hear it)  then because i wanted to be just like alice's big brother up until like a few weeks ago(he's such a macho hunk with awesome hair).  there's kung fu, girls lifting weights and turning into bugs, and a nerdy girl with asthma that gets totally destroyed in the face(who doesn't wanted to see that?).  it's got all the dialogue you thought was the bees knees when you where a kid, a killer soundtrack, and some pretty good special effects that still hold decently strong even today.  for any fan of the series this is a must have because seriously this movie owns you when you buy not the other way around.",1173744000,,2131,4.475452196382429
36153,4,0780630874,"This film brings little semantically. It is the direct sequel of the previous episode, with the same surviving characters who lead to a few new ones. The pattern is the same : Freddy kills a few teenagers and is finally stopped by one of them, a girl again. Yet this film is original in two ways. First its director is extremely experienced in that kind of frightening films. He is an expert in stringing together, one after another frightening elements and effects, and when fear is not used then it is grossness and we move to some level of disgust. Yet we are never terrorized, just horrified and disgusted. Why is that ? Because the audience targeted by the film bans the idea of terrorizing them. The film director doesn't want the film to be restricted. So the film is very careful not to show any unnecessary or just alluring flesh or skin. We are targeting teenagers, so please no sex. Yet in that line of extreme ability at interweaving frightening elements one into the other, the director reflects his time with a few elements that may be surprising for a 1988 film. The characters definitely smoke too much and quite very conspicuously, and yet this gesture of lighting a cigarette is systematically associated with a bad turn in the action. In 1988 we were starting to take measures against tobacco. This film is reflecting this anti-smoking discourse directed at teenagers. This element along with the sexless vision of these young people shows how the American society had changed within ten years and had become very puritanical, though it was going to go a lot further later on. This change, of course brought up by the director, is totally in phase with the second element I want to note here as a new development in the saga. It is the religious dimension of the film. The end takes place in a church. Freddy is destroyed by his own reflection in a piece of color stained glass from a broken color-stained window in that church. Freddy is destroyed by his own reflection and by the rebellion of the souls he had captured and he was holding prisoners in his own body. They tear him apart and finally rip his jaw off and so open the evading door they need to escape. And they do and go directly into heaven. This religious theme is in many ways surprising, and yet not so much. The American society in this 1988 period is slowly moving towards some kind of self-resourcing in christianity. The Christians born again were starting to call in the wings, and even to walk in the streets. That was the end of Reagan's presidency and the beginning of George Bush Sr's four years. The theme of religious purity was obviously growing, to the point of using a horror film as the medium to bring the message to teenagers. We then understand why they avoided any theme, element or detail that could have restricted the audience in the name of the protection against sex or even violence that is curbed to a symbolical minimum in this episode.

36154,5,0780630874,"Once again, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) has returned from the grave to menace the remaining elm street children in this fourth installment of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series.

Kristen (Tuesday Knight), Joey (Rodney Eastman), and Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) managed to survive Freddy's razors in Part 3, but will they be as lucky this time?  Kristen still believes that Freddy is not dead and will be coming back for her as well as Joey and Kincaid.  She uses her dream skills to pull Joey and Kincaid into one of her dreams.  Once inside, they find that Freddy is indeed dead, but Kincaid's dog bites Kristen on the arm.

The following day, Kristen dirves to the Johnson house to pick up her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox) and Rick (Andras Jones).  They arrive at school and meet up with friends Debbie (Brooke Thiess), and Sheila (Toy Newkirk).  That night, both Joey and Kincaid are killed by Freddy.  Now, Kristen is the last member of the Elm Street children whose parents killed Freddy Krueger.

Kristen's mother is worried about her mental state and slips her some sleeping pills.  She finds herself on a beach, but Freddy is there too.  Freddy manages to throw Kristen into a boiler, but she passes her special powers on to Alice.  As each remaining teen is killed, Alice gains their strength, until she is finally strong enough to face Freddy in a final battle.  Who will win?  Will it be Alice and all of her powers, or will the dreammaster prevail?

I found this movie to be the best of the series so far.  Wes Craven continues his mastery of the series, and the storyline in this film is the best so far.  I was a little disappointed with parts 2 and 3, but part 4 definitely got the series back on the right track.  Lisa Wilcox does a teriffic job as Alice, and Tuesday Knight is excellent as Kristen.

Hello, all the death scenes takes place in the victim's dream sequence. In real life, u can dream of everything like turning into a cockroach like one of victims in the movie. The reason she died as a cockroach is because she had a fear of cockroaches. Remember, when the teens were introduced in the beginning of the movie there was a cockroach in the one of the girl's potatoe chips she was eating and she stepped on it. People are talking down on this movie they say this sequel doesn't make sense. The problem here is people need to pay more attention. The only thing that's inconsistent is the ending when Freddy looks at himself in the broken piece of window from the church and he suppposedly dies from looking at himself in the reflection. And this movie had a killer and i mean killer soundtrack. This movie was made for the big screen or home theatre system. Part 1, 3, and 4 are the best. Part 2 and 6 (the final nightmare) sucked.

36159,4,0780630874,"Compare any other long running horror series to the Nightmare series and you'll gain appreciation for it.  I love the Friday movies but they were all same exact movie.  This movie is definitely a creation of the 80's and has a ton of pop culture references to it.  This is also the movie where Freddy fully changed from an evil creepy ghoul to a cool guy you want to root for.  That is something that always takes away the scare factor from additional installments of horror movies.  Much like the Friday series and the Halloween series with this series the audience is much more inclined to root for the iconic villain rather than feel the emotions of the victims.  Robert Englund is the guy that allows the Nightmare movies like this one to separate themselves for the Friday and Halloween movies.  His portrayal of Freddy has always been great, it's the actors that surround him that tend to drag the movies down some.  A lot of the other reviewers are way too critical of this movie, it is a fantasy driven horror franchise after all.  If you accept the fact that Freddy can even exist in these movies than you should be able to except the other aspects.  The Dream Master is a worthy addition to the best horror franchise ever.  Freddy will always be the greatest horror icon.

36160,1,0780630874,"Ya know, I hated this film the day it hit the theaters, and after viewing it again last night I still hate it.  This is a part 4 in a series, and when films hit Part 4, things are usually rather stale.  It's possible to make a decent 2 and 3, but by the time you get to 3, people pretty much know what to expect, so you'd better do something unique to make it good.  Nightmare 3 managed to do this, though good as it was, things were starting to feel a bit been there/done that at that point.  Plus, Freddy's demise at the end of 3 was believable and was the most final of all his other ""deaths"".  If they hadn't have tacked on that last scene to keep the sequel door open, 3 would have been a wonderful place to end the series and have it go out with a bang.  However, the power of the dollar is even stronger than Freddy on his best day, and soon we got part 4.  Part 4 definitely has that feeling of a film done just for the sake of doing a sequel.  Sure, they upped the budget and gave it more visual razzle dazzle, but the low budget of the first film played a huge role in how effective the movie was.  Nightmare On Elm Street's low budget helped it immensely, it didn't hurt it.  The big budget on 4 hurts it bigtime, coz that's all it has going for it.  We get all the cliched scenes of the heroine creeping around the dilapidated Freddy house, the jumproping girls, all the stuff we loved about the earlier films, yet this time around it's zero scary and downright tiresome.  You know something's wrong when you can't get Patricia Arquette to reprise her role and replace her with probably the worst actress the series has ever seen.  Second, Renny Harlin directed this-Nuff said.  All kinds of new cornball rules and twists are added to the Freddy mythos, and it's stuff a middleschool kid would find lame.  For no concrete reason, Freddy returns and terrorizes Kristin, the heroine of the previous film.  Once she's out of the way(to both Freddy's and the viewer's delight), Freddy sets his sights on a whole new slate of kids which he gets to through redhead Alice, who has inherited Kristin's dream powers.  Sound dumb yet?  Basically Alice fills in the Kristin shoes by figuring out how to fight Freddy while her annoying teenage buddies drop off like flies.  Like I said, it's more of the same ol, same ol, but without any kind of thrill to it.  How many times do we have to see Freddy pull off his sweater to reveal the chest full of souls?  I will admit however , that the girl being turned into an insect was rather cool, and kinda disturbing.  Now I realize that when a series goes on for awhile that the boogeyman ceases to be as scary as he used to coz we're all kinda used to him, but c'mon, man!  Don't turn the guy into a joke for crying out loud!  Hell, I love the Friday the 13th sequels, but those were silly from the moment Jason popped into the picture, so it's fine that they remained silly.  Nightmare on the other hand is a series that started off legitimately creepy and turned lame as it went on.  What they should have done is just stop at 3.

36164,4,0780630874,"Okay, seriously people. Get over the fact that this movie decided to do something different stylistically. I'm glad Renny Harlin took a different approach particularly since I'm really not that big a fan of the third. (Although to say that is something of herecy in the nigtmare community.)

 Yes, Tuesday is an awful actress, and watching her is painful. But hey, Patricia Arquette was busy and it makes it all the more pleasureable to watch her get burned alive. That's really the only downside to this movie. This is my favorite Nightmare film. Before you get all defensive Nightmare fans, let me explain!-

First of all, the whole scary thing just isn't going to work anymore. We know what Freddy looks like. It's not a shock to see him anymore. Harlin's use of making Freddy the hero and delivering comedy was perfect to add entertainment to the movie without going too far over the camp line.

Yeah, so a lot of people think this movie makes no sense. Ugh...are you serious people? As horror movie fans, are we really that limited in our ability to appreciate the abstract? I am so sick of people saying ""I don't get it! Why does she get her friends powers? Why is it so weird?"" Okay, I will admit the end with the mirror thing is pretty random, but Alice is the Dream Master. (Uh, thats why its titled that, people.) She's Freddy's opposite and its her job to protect the dreaming from Freddy, so she has this natural power to control her dreams and use the powers of her friends against him. Personally, I thought the change Alice undergoes was pretty cool.

Harlin also does a great job of giving us a dark trippy universe that is perfect for Freddy's Nightmares, and the transition of story line from the Elm Street kids to Alice is smoother than you would expect.

I love the death sequences in this film particularly the asthma girl, and Joey's death scene which is sweetly reminiscent of Depp's scene in the first Nightmare film. Give this movie a break people! (Please)",1132704000,6,1983,4.619318181818182
36165,5,0780630874,"First off, I hate when people are reviewing a slasher sequel and complain that it brings nothing new to the table. If you're watching Friday the 13th pt. 7, or Nightmare 4, it's not really for plotline. It is to see lots of dopey teens get killed in bloody/creative ways, and to see a lot of your favorite killer. And while this film isn't very bloody, there are a bunch of creative deaths and a ton of Freddy.

  So to re-re-re-iterate the plot, Freddy has killed all but three of the Elm Street kids and needs someone to bring him fresh victims. The acting is good, characters likeable, and special effects were great, (especially compared to prt. 5) The deaths are inventive, and Freddy cracks a few jokes, which I know is the reason some people don't like the sequels, but personally the more Freddy the better. I like that he makes fun of the kids. If I wanted a silent killer I'd watch Jason. So while the first film is great and a classic (plus you get to see Johnny Depp get vomited out of a bed) and part 3 is the scariest, The Dream Master will always be my favorite.

36168,5,0780630874,"In 1988, director Renny Harlin wanted to take the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies one step further by directing the fourth installment, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER. This installment to the series was actually the most successful, even more successful than the series original NIGHTMARE film.

  KRISTIN PARKER (played by Tuesday Knight, who took over for Patricia Arquette) has been FREDDY KRUEGER (again played by Robert Englund). But she has the strongest feeling that Freddy will be coming back. She gets this feeling when she has a nightmare, where she is standing Nancy's old house on 1428 Elm Street, where the original nightmares all started. She uses her dream skills to pull in JOEY CRUSEL (again played by Rodney Eastman) and ROLAND KINCAID (again played by Ken Sagoes). They arrive in her dream and help her realize that Freddy is deader than dead, which is when Kincaid's dog, Jason, jumps in and bites Kristen's arm.

  The next morning, Kristen drives to the Johnson's house. She is best friends with ALICE JOHNSON (played by Lisa Wilcox) and is dating Alice's brother, RICK JOHNSON (played by Andras Jones). Alice and Rick have lost their mother, and they deal with their father, DENNIS JOHNSON (played by Nicholas Mele), who is a drunk.

  They arrive at school and meet up with their friends, DEBBIE STEVENS (played by Brooke Theiss) and SHEILA KOPECKY (played by Toy Newkirk). Debbie is a tough a**, while Sheila is the brain. Kristen is at her locker, where Kincaid and Joey appear, talking to Kristen about the night before. That night, both Joey and Kincaid are killed by Freddy. Kristen is now the last member of the Elm Street kids, whose parents killed Freddy Krueger.

  The next morning, Kristen finds out about the deaths of Joey and Kincaid. She takes Rick, Alice, and DAN JORDAN (played by Danny Hassel) to where 1428 Elm, where it all started. Rick is best friends with Dan. Alice has a crush on Dan, so maybe there's a chance of Dan and Alice starting a little something.

  That night, Kristen's mother, ELAINE PARKER (again played by Brooke Bundy) slips her sleeping pills, forcing Kristen to fall asleep. But Kristen remembers what Alice had told her: Dream someplace nice, you're in control. Kristen finds herself in a dream on the beach, but that is ruined, when Freddy turns it into the boiler room. Kristen accidentally brings in Alice. Protecting Alice, Kristen quarrels with Freddy, where he throws her into a huge flame, burning her alive. Kristen passes along her Bringing-Others-Into-One's-Dream talent to Alice.

  The next morning, Sheila is killed. Alice seems to have received Sheila's brain smarts talent. Rick doesn't know what do with his sister. It tears him apart to see his sister this hysterical and upset.

  The next afternoon, Rick falls asleep and is murdered by Freddy. But Alice receives his fighting skills, since Rick was sort of an expert in martial arts. At the funeral, Alice, Dan, and Debbie plan to meet at Debbie's house, to figure out what they are going to do about this. But Mr. Johnson won't let Alice out of the house.

  She falls asleep and dreams of going to a movie, where she is sucked into a movie at a diner scene. The diner turns into the diner where Alice works. The waitress at the counter is an older version of Alice. Next to her is Freddy. He has already killed the last of the Elm Street kids and wants more that had nothing to do with his murder. Alice awakes and sets out to meet Dan at the diner, where she and he drive off to Debbie's.

  Freddy appears by Debbie's side and plans her murder, by turning her into a roach. Making this complete, he keeps sending Dan and Alice in circles, repeating the same scene until he squishes a roach version of Debbie. At that moment of her death, Alice receives Alice's toughness and physical strength, causing her to get into an accident. Alice is fine, but Dan is pretty banged up.

  Alice and Dan arrive at the hospital, where Dan hits surgery in fifteen minutes. Alice drives home, takes some sleeping pills and prepares herself to fight Freddy. She falls asleep at the moment, Dan is under the gas. She enters his dream and they both find Freddy. But as they find him, Dan awakes, after a successful surgery.

  Alice has a brief battle with Freddy. But Alice beats him by reciting the Dream Master poem and causing Evil to see itself.

  This is actually my favorite NIGHTMARE of them all. Freddy may have been more funny than scary, but this NIGHTMARE was the most outstanding of them all. There is one copy left on Amazon.com. Whoever wants it, better jump on it.",1117670400,,4621,4.703980099502488

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Robert Englund, Rodney Eastman, Danny Hassel, Andras Jones, Tuesday Knight, Ken Sagoes, Lisa Wilcox, Brooke Bundy, Nicholas Mele, Toy Newkirk, Brooke Theiss, Hope Marie Carlton, Linnea Quigley. Freddy Krueger Makeup By Kevin Yagher. Score Composed By Craig Safan. Co-Produced By Robert Shaye. Co-Produced By Rachel Talalay. Directed By Renny Harlin. (R) For Violence, Mild Gore, Profanity, Brief Nudity and Very Mild Sexual Content; 93m.; 1988.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: The last of the original Elm Street kids thought they buried the nightmare that was Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). But it's hard to keep pure evil down, and Freddy once again rises from the grave to invade the dreams of Springwood's children. However, with only three kids remaining (Kristen, Joey and Kincaid from ""Nightmare 3""), Freddy needs to find a way to reach out and touch the souls of all the untapped children whose parents weren't a part of Krueger's mortal murder. Through Kristen, Freddy gains access to Alice Johnson's (Lisa Wilcox) dreams and opens up a whole new nightmarish world of possibilities. Director Renny Harlin (""Die Hard 2"", ""Cliffhanger"") brings a lot of flair to this third ""Nightmare"" sequel which securely picks up where ""Dream Warriors"" left off. The lame, almost miscast Patricia Arquette is gone from the role of Kristen Parker. Replacing her is the highly commendable (not to mention extraordinarily cute) Tuesday Knight who also performs the opening song to this movie. Returning cast members Ken Sagoes and (particularly) Rodney Eastman have matured comfortably in their roles as Kincaid and Joey respectively. Newcomer Andras Jones (as Rick Johnson) is a nice addition to the new teenage cast, bringing with him a light-hearted cockiness that's appealing, but Lisa Wilcox steals the show. She owns this movie with her startling transformation from mousy introvert to confident demon stalker. Robert Englund, having played Freddy in all three previous entries, doesn't even have to exert himself to pull off a wonderful performance. Portraying the character of Freddy has become second nature to Englund and he delivers the goods in style. Viewers even have the chance to see him out of the Freddy make-up again in this film. Instead of showing up as a bus driver, however, he shows up as a school nurse...a female school nurse. There's a little more humor in this film than there was in the others, but it's a welcome addition to the formula. One touch that can be distracting is the lighting for this film. Often times, it makes the movie resemble a comic book instead of a dark world of slumber and fear. But the screenplay is engrossing enough to keep Freddy fans happy. Even the score will reel movie fans in. Composer Craig Safan offers up the best musical background since Charles Bernstein's original, always remaining true to his source material. Trivia buffs take note: in the first cemetery sequence, viewers are given the opportunity to see both Nancy Thompson and her father's tombstones. This is a brilliant piece of extra continuity that ties ""Nightmare 4"" to parts one and three. Also, after Alice falls asleep in the movie theater and gets sucked through the screen, pay particular attention to the applauding audience. The audience is comprised of all the teenagers who died in the film up to that point. Overall, this film has a late eighties feel to it that adds a nostalgic flourish to an already gratifying production. Long time fans of the series will find much to love about this film and the more casual viewer looking for a good time won't be let down either.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: There is a sparkling 1.85:1 widescreen transfer of the film that is a majestic sight to behold. The presentation is so clear that you can see the match head inside of the flame Kristen uses to light her cigarette. Outdoor locations appear so realistic that it's easy to feel you're looking through a window instead of watching a movie. The accompanying 5.1 surround sound is the best to date on any of the ""Nightmare"" DVDs. Every clanking chain and piece of shattering glass has its own unique sound and they are all bright, well separated manifestations. This disc also includes the original stereo audio track for the film and easy to read English subtitles which are placed within the frame of the movie. Not surprisingly, this is another paper case from New Line. The front is a miniaturized recreation of the original theatrical poster while the rest of the case is devoid of any artwork. The inside highlights the list of special features and the twenty-seven chapter stops which make up this ninety minute movie. The DVD itself has been painted with a picture of a shadowed Freddy Krueger standing in a smoky backlit area. Special features for this disc include the ""Jump to a Nightmare"" option. There's also a brief but enlightening cast and crew section taken from the original theatrical press kit for the film. DVD-ROM users can also view the interactive screenplay for the film, they can play the fourth ""Dream World"" trivia game and they can visit up-to-the-minute weblinks.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: New Line Cinema has packed their boxed set so well that they don't need to place hidden easter eggs on the separate discs. You're more likely to make your way out of the maze of cars in the junkyard before Freddy slices and dices you than you are of finding easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: During Joey's dream sequence, the pin-up girl (Hope Marie Carlton appearing as herself) hanging on his wall disappears off the poster where she resided and pops up underneath the lining of his waterbed. We're treated to a lovely view of her breasts before she sinks back down into the watery depths. Later in the film, one of the girls (Linnea Quigley) trapped in Freddy's chest of souls bares her breasts, but that's more of a disturbing visual rather than an enticing one.

THE GORE REPORT: There's some mild gore early on in this film when Freddy is resurrected in the car junkyard. His bones reattach themselves and then his blood, tendons and muscles start to reform over those bones. Another segment of interest for the gore hounds comes later in the movie when Freddy turns one of the teenagers into a giant cockroach. Markedly grand is when her face is ripped off to reveal the roach head while she's trapped in Freddy's roach motel.

SAY AGAIN: ""Welcome to Wonderland, Alice."" - Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund)

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. This is a prime example of late eighties horror and Freddy fanatics won't be able to get enough of Krueger's wry witticisms and uniquely inventive death scenes. As part of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street Collection"" boxed set, it is indispensable. Separately, this film represents a culmination of the terror, sarcasm and characterization ""Nightmare"" followers demand.

36171,4,0780630874,"For the fourth time, we are presented the continuing nightmare of the deliciously evil Freddy Krueger.  This time Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2) directs and the script is cowritten by the wonderful Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, LA Confidential).  Robert Englund returns as Freddy and this time he's full of one liners that are both repulsive and wickedly funny.  Freddy is the ultimate killing machine, showing no mercy to the doomed kids, and delighting in the unique ways he can kill.  Tuesday Knight (what an awful name) takes over Patricia Arquette's role in this one, but she and the two survivors from # 3 aren't around too long.  We get a new heroine in the comely Lisa Wilcox, who touts the dream master, who is a friendly spirit that can make your dreams good.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work out for Lisa and her friends.  Although not the best in the series, Dream Master manages to entertain and gives us some nice performances from newcomers Wilcox, Andras Jones and Danny Hassel.  But as always, it's Freddy's movie and even though it looks like they might have not planned any more sequels, we know 5, 6, and 7 were on their way.",1113091200,,1142,4.703517587939698

This is one thing in the series that is really good- it doesn't get boring. I was entertained in seeing the new things that were brought into this new addition to the NOES series. I love the fact that I will always see something new and i won't be yawning in it.

It is about a girl who can bring people into her dreams, sometimes putting them in danger, sometimes wanting them to get her out of danger. It was fun to see her do this. She is scared of Freddy, and that brings him back into the dreams to kill once again. It's very entertaining to see her and her friends try to kick some a** and try to defeat Fred once again!",1112140800,4,795,3.96875

nothing Scary or morbid. Buy this one if

you want a good chuckle. Not to be terrified.

The 1st and 2nd Nighmare movies are the best. Dark,

Spooky, scary, gothic, morbid, gross, bloody etc.

Parts 4, 5, Freddy's Dead and A New Nightmare

are just trying Wayyy too hard to keep the

36177,5,0780630874,"One of the very best of the ""Nightmare"" series, along with the original Elm Street and the ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" crossover.  Assuming an epic, larger-than-life air the kind of which would not be equaled in the series until the landmark confrontation with Jason Voorhees, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" finds Freddy Krueger more powerful than ever, practically unstoppable until encountering Alice, the titular 'Dream Master', whose timid, in-drawn existance has seen her live her life in daydreams, to the point where, when drawn into Krueger's world of making nightmare real, she attains the ability to become a foil for Freddy, tapping into a latent ability to use her imagination to resculpt the dreamworld herself.  It brings to a head what could be interpreted as the whole undercurrent of the series up to this point, that of all Freddy's power being rooted in altering his victims's perceptions of reality to the point where they in effect become reality; and Usually (but not always)the only way to effectively fight him is to either disbelieve his hold on you strong enough, or to find a way to alter the physical parameters of the dreamworld in the same way he does.  It becomes a stage of nightmare and fear vs. dream and fantasy, with the demonic Krueger representing the former and Alice (excellently played by Lisa Wilcox, in one of the best turns of an Elm Street heroine) representing the latter.

  This isn't to suggest that the whole movie is purely metaphorical and ultra-philosophical throughout.  The film certainly isn't hurt by the fact that it's also one of the sexiest, most effects-laden, action-packed and dynamically filmed entries in the Elm Street line.  The successful melding of the physical and the metaphysical, the gory and the implied, makes ""Dream Master"" easily one of the best of the Freddy Krueger movies.",1100822400,,1860,4.996763754045308
36178,5,0780630874,"I Like the NOES series; as a whole they work well. It's pretty obvious that Renny Harlin was brought in to add a commercial zing.

It's got the right mix, but not the touch that Wes Craven adds like he does in 1,3, and 7.

Freddy Carries the rest of the films, and does so very well.

This is a great popcorn film, but if you look at it too closely it falls apart, and does not add up. It's a good part of the overall mythos, but not a solid ride, and is part of the downward slide up til film 6, where Rachel Talalay proves she should never have been at the helm of the Freddy vehicle 6.

Still, worth a watch, especially if you are a fan, and want to see the whole shebang ... take it with a grain of salt... after all, Renny is at the helm  :-)",1096934400,,747,3.8562091503267975

Have to admit not as great as teh 3rd!... fyi :Dream Wariors.  After you see it you'll wish you dog peed fire and reaurected you relatives.

She borders on hammy in one instance then completely uniterested the next. You can tell her heart is in it and she's putting everything she can into her performance. I love her for this, even if the end result is over the top! I also adore how she has that really big grey streak still in her hair from the first film- gotta love continuity in your slasher flicks!

This movie brings something new and interesting to the series in that a group of teenagers in a psychiatric institution all band together and join each other's dreams to fight Freddy once and for all.

Sadly, the extra features on this dvd do not include a commentary.",1094601600,,746,4.636363636363637

Not the usual let's see what idiot gets whacked next.  Although part 5 was fair it didn't live up to the expectations set in 4.  However, the rest sucked after 5.

36182,1,0780630874,"After the fantastic third chapter DREAM WARRIORS I expected an even
beter follow up in this fourth film. When I left the theatre in August of 1988
I was crushed.  NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 THE DREAM MASTER is an
incoherent, nonsensical mess. A real dissaster. Let me reitterate A PIECE OF
CRAP!!!!!. The movie has no plot at all, just a bunch of effects sequences linked together by nonsense. Freddy returns, despite his ""HOLY BANISHMENT"" in
part3, with no explanation at all. Lead warrior Kristen Parker is not only a
different actress but comes across like a whole other character. New heroine
Alice takes on the personalities and skills of her friends whom Freddy has killed. HUH!!!
 Freddy seems to have almost God-like powers this time out and
is able to transform one character into a tiny insect. Heck, if he can do that than I wonder how anyone can even hope to defeat him.  None of this is ever explained.
 Characters resite a ""dream master"" ryme that is awful and makes no sense at all.  I won't even try to explain the climax because I still haven't figured it out myself. Something about ""Freddy can't look at his own reflection or the souls of his victims will rip him apart from inside."" HuH!??!!??
This was the most financially seccessful Elm Street film, but that is because of the big openning it had.  When all the fans like me who loved the third movie laid down five (this was 1988) bucks to see what would happen next and walked out wishing we hadn't.  A real stinker that totally insults Freddy fans.
  If you enjoyed this movie than allow me to recommend..
 HIGHLANDER 2 ,  ROBOCOP 2,  SUPERMAN 4: THE QUEST FOR PEACE,
 JAWS: THE REVENGE,  MORTAL COMBAT: ANNIHILATION ,

 or THE ALLNIGHTER
To all of you fans who were offended by this review. Let me just say that in 1988 I was absolutely in love with the Freddy series. I really TRIED to like this one. I found it hard to. The people I saw it with didn't like it. My friends hated it , and the kids I talked to in my high school didn't like it either. In fact I cant think of one person I talked to at the time who did like it. So, In my own  defence, I don't believe I am alone in my opinions about part 4. Like I said, I tried to like it and I WANT to like it. after all its Freddy, my hero from my youth, but its just such a mess. I know from the letters written the front of Fangoria in '88 that alot of people did/do like part 4. But then I remember that alot of people like dope, alchohol abuse, self mutilation, child molestation and crack cocaine",1092700800,7,2645,4.372188139059305

ISNT THE POINT OF A SEQUEL TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL PREMISE AND TRY IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT STRIDE? THE ACTORS ARE ALSO IMPRESSIVE AND CAN EASILY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, FOR THIS SORT OF HONEST EFFORT ISNT USUALLY FOUND.

36184,4,0780630874,"After the powerhouse that was the conclusion of Nightmare On Elm Street III: Dream Warriors, I was prepared for anything in this movie...and that's about what I got.  The script was a little weak in how it handled itself, not by the writing, but because of who it killed off and why.  I felt that after the massive killing of survivors from the first film at the end of the previous film, that maybe they wouldn't clean slate us at the beginning of this one, but that's just what they did.

Freddy is back, however from what I can tell it was because of magical fire urine from Kincaid's pet dog in a dream, but either way he's back!  There's a new group of kids meshing with the three survivors of the previous film (Kincaid, Joey, and Kristen) and they are all beginning to have nightmares.  Alice is closest friends with Kristen and after seeing her killed by Freddy, has become the new target.  Alice is the normally quiet, softspoken, and very scared girl but once her friends start to die she begins to toughen up.  Now it's time for the Dream Master to face up with another strong-willed girl (again), but is Alice really capable of taking on Freddy Kruger?

I'm going to start off on a positive note, because I feel criticism is only appropriate when following praise.  Robert England has yet again returned to play Freddy and at this point it's clear that the franchise won't succeed without him (which is really only good news for Robert England and devoted fans).  Alice (played by Lisa Wilcox) starts off as a weak character, but once her role spices her up we can see that it isn't the actress, but rather the script that lacks.  Director Renny Harlin also takes the movie in new directions (especially because he co-wrote it) by removing Freddy's dream world and creating a parallel ""altering reality"" universe to the kids dreams.  This new idea was refreshing and helped to make the movie still a little more scary, but with Freddy's now witty banter and subtle jokes in the death scenes it's not that creepy anymore.  The special effects were still quite good, especially because the movie didn't attempt too much and accidentally come off as fake looking.

Now, having said that, I have some concerns with this film.  I didn't like that Patricia Arquette didn't return to play Kristen (which I'd like to think explains her early death, but I fear the two are unrelated).  It's not because I'm a Patricia Arquette fan, but more because it ruined the aesthetic of the series.  Every character in the entire series that returns, from the large roles to the small, are always played by the same actor/actress, which I think is very credible because it helps create this world as a reality.  When Patricia Arquette didn't return, it ruined that aesthetic.  I also didn't like that we lose all the survivors from Part III when we just lost all the survivors from Part I at the end of Part III.  I guess they're trying to prove that the new Freddy can make short change of the people that defeated him before, but it just made me lose that connection to a character that I had followed in the series.  I also didn't like the incredibly weak explanation (or lack thereof) of how Freddy comes back to life because there was a very specific ritual created to keep him buried and just because I accepted his return didn't mean I liked how it was done.

The DVD follows the same format as all the previous.  The movie is in widescreen and in 5.1 Dolby Digital format with the ""Jump To A Death"" sequence feature.  All in all, this is basically the birth of a second generation of two-parters in this series (because realistically 1 & 3 go together and 4 & 5 go together, the rest are free floating) and unless you liked part 5 also or intend to own both (or the whole series) this movie may not be for you.  Fans of the series will definitely still find it entertaining and although it proves that every series will begin to falter, it's still a decent addition to the franchise.",1092096000,2,3983,4.544817927170868

36188,3,0780630874,"Average and overrated, the two words that describe this movie. I'm not just saying this because I kind of bashed Freddy in my other review, but I don't see how this made the most money at the box office. Sure, there are some sequences that were funny, but most of the movie was tired and predictable.
The story picks up from the last Nightmare movie, with the heroine Kristen and her friends. As usual, Freddy gets resurructed (in a very weird way, even though it was in a dream) and finishes them off quite nicely. Then Kristen bites the dust because her mom slipped sleeping pills in her drink, but not before she drags Alice into her dream and gives her the power to pull people into her dreams. One by one, Alice's friends die at Freddy's hands (?) because she mistakingly pulls them into her dreams. Then comes the predictable ending. Big whoop.
The acting was average at best, except for Robert Englund, who does a pretty good job with the jokes and the methods of killing and etc. But the movie definitely lacked the horror from Nightmare 1, 2, and 3. It was more like stand-up comedy than a horror movie. I'm not even going to go into how the body doubles looked. (koff;horrible;koff)",1086048000,,1192,4.523148148148148
36189,2,0780630874,"I am a big Freddy fan, if you don't beleive me, read my reviews on the other Frederick films, but this one is defentally the most over-rated. It's a shame really, because you get ones like number 2 and 5 which, in my opinion, are under-rated, and much better than this one.
  The main characters of this film really shift places half way through. At the begining, and for about the first half hour, the main character is the surviver from number 3, Christene. Then she...well, you know. So then it's her best friend, Alice.
  The story of the film has Freddy, once again, rising from his grave (he's revived by a dog's flaming urine. I know, it's in a dream, but I think it's even a little too far fetched for that). Basically, he finishes off all that's left of the children of the lynch mob that killed him, which is only three. But now he want's to invade the dreams of the ""new"" children of Elm Street, and start his reighn of terror all over again. We basically find out that he can't just come in their dreams like before, but that he firstly needs ""someone"" to bring them to him. That's when Alice, the dream master, steps in. She unwilingly brings Freddy new victims by falling asleep, so whenever she shuts her eyes, someone bites it. Now that's what you call a hard life!
  Now as I said in my review for number 3 Freddy became more comedic from then on, but this one really takes the michael. Freddy ain't scary at all anymore, Robert Englund's lines are almost all taken up with jokes.
  I'm sorry, but I can't see why this one made the most money at the box office, I really can't. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just not good, either. If the word ""average"" was made for any film, this was that film. Yes, visually it is good, but I'm sorry, that just doesn't save it for me. All the acting from the teenagers is pretty average. Again, though, like before, Robert Englund is a lot of fun. This guy really knows how to play a wise-cracking pyschopath.
  So, I'm sorry to say, don't believe all the hype, this film don't deserve it.",1084752000,,2076,4.341085271317829
36190,4,0780630874,"A good horror film.  Not as goor as the first and the second one is but no cheesy parts.  I though the whole possesion thing in thge second Nigmare was cheesy.
Freedy  has return and he is once again kill the children of Elm Street.  Get strenght by  absorb the souls of those he killed into his body. He is not as evil in this one as he was in the past.
Lots of action and adventure.  A really good fight sequence at the end inside of a church.  Alice is brave and beautiful.  There are some cheese parts when it rips of other movies.
Fighting invisible Freedy reminds me of  poltergist series.  I thought the pizza gay at the end was a bit cheezy.  The only problem with Nightmare 3 and 4 is they lack the scary  ends that Nigtmare 1 and 2 had.  If you like this series I recommend seeing Nightmare on Elm Street 1, Night mare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge , Nightmare on Elm Street 3, Drem Warrior,  Nigmare on Elm street 5 Dream Child, Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare, New Nightmare, and Freedy versus Jason.",1082937600,,1017,4.229166666666667

Decent kills, everyone loves the 'suck face' scene. Cockroach girl was good too. And how can we forget Freddy's favorite topping on his pizza? Soul food indeed.

36192,5,0780630874,"I just got the nightmare on Elm Street collection!!! Sorry 'bout that,but I can't get over the fabulousness of it. Anyway the Dream Master. I really liked this one! Ok, it's not very gory but the death sequences are really imaginative. Another of the best things about it I thought was how it was in sync well with Dream warriors. It picks up with Kristen, Kincade and Joey who are still recovering from the previous movie(who wouldn't be?} But as the well-paced film move along the focus shifts from Kristen to Alice. Alice gains the strengh from her departed friends where as Freddy gets their souls. Alice's personality changes as more people are killed,and she also gains power eg Kristen's ability to pull others into her dream. And when her brother Rick is killed..(sob)..Alice aquires his fighting skills, prepareing her for the inevitable battle with Freddy. The acting is great especially Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. Lisa Wilcox also does a great job as the troubled Alice, who has dramatic personality changes. The charicters are likeable(especially Rick) instead of tedious which is great and one of the distinguisting features in all the Elm Street movies. It's not exactly scary, but The Dream Master is one hell of a great movie, well paced, well done and well acted. This was Deathgirl, telling you why The Dream master is a great sequel and an excelent movie in general. Mind over matter.",1078790400,4,1410,4.903765690376569
36193,5,0780630874,"While things may have become a little predictable by the time of the fourth Freddy film, I think this is a great movie; it is certainly an important one because it serves as a necessary transition between the early films and the later sequels.  After all, the supply of Elm Street kids borne of Freddy's killers is limited; there are only three such kids still alive as this movie begins, and if there's one thing Freddy hates it's a survivor.  Once these last three are gone, what is Freddy going to do?  This film answers that question.  It also delivers some deliciously creative deaths and witty repartee a la Krueger.  It bolsters and redefines the balance between what has been and what will be, keeping the series fresh while maintaining the overall continuity.  The very focus of the action completely changes midway through the film, something you would never see in many a horror film or series.
I think the film starts off very effectively, wisely holding off on the introduction of Freddy until such time as the audience has settled in to the story.  This is particularly important because one of the three returning survivors from the previous film, Kristen, is now played by Tuesday Knight rather than Patricia Arquette.  Kristen is crucial to this film because she has the power to pull other people into her nightmares, and this serves as the conduit for Freddy's reappearance.  The physical manifestation of Freddy's rebirth is quite memorable, informing us of one special liquid that obviously nullifies the power of holy water.  I think the film also does a fairly good job of introducing us to the new ""fresh meat,"" and this becomes important because the new dream master who emerges here (Alice played by Lisa Wilcox) incorporates aspects of each of the victims in terms of her own strength for the final fight against Freddy.  As for our Freddy, he wastes no time in getting back to work after his return, and this film boasts some very colorful, impressive kills: the Jaws scene is a true classic.  The sight of Robert Englund in a nurse's outfit is pretty darn hard to force out of your head, but with one exception (that being the roach motel kill) I found all of Freddy's ingenious handiwork quite a joy to watch.
Is the movie perfect?  No.  Besides the one unsatisfactory kill, the movie also chooses to use one terribly clich&eacute;d scene toward the beginning of the end.  These small weaknesses are more than offset by the strength of the transitional storyline, the continuity of this film in the overall series, the colorful and impressive nature of the kills (and there are more kills in this movie than you will find in the first and third installments), and the wickedly funny tongue of the always delightful Mr. Krueger.  Things get a little corny in the end, but this film certainly offers a memorable ending.  I remember going home from the theater and worrying that this might have been the final Elm Street movie because things really aren't looking too good for our old friend Freddy when the credits start to roll.  This film is not as good as the first and third films, nor does it reveal any new secrets surrounding Freddy's origins, but it is a must-see, very entertaining sojourn in Freddy's Dreamland.  On a final note, viewers will certainly notice a souped-up soundtrack for this film, as Elm Street 4 injects some energetic rock and roll into the viewing experience.  Let the ending credits roll if you want to hear our Freddy doing a little rapping; you don't want to miss that.",1074556800,16,3530,4.755737704918033
36194,4,0780630874,"The first three Nightmare On Elm Street movies were nothing less than masterpieces of horror.  This one, however, is where things start going downhill.
Not that it's a bad movie, mind you, I thought it was very entertaining.  I've heard people say that part 3 was the beginning of Freddy's comical side.  That is just not true.  Part 3 was very scary and far from funny.  THIS movie (part 4) is where Freddy starts to joke around and kind of deviate from his evil demeanor.
The story revolves around Alice, a girl who has unique ""dream powers"".  Her friends are getting killed one by one in their dreams, until Alice figures out what's going on and realizes she must put a stop to it.  Some of the scenes are kind of cool (Freddy in the classroom, Joey's waterbed death, the beach scene).  But my favorite scene is where Alice's brother, Rick (karate expert) fights an invisible Freddy.  This scene was a total trip!
But overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to diehard horror fans.  Stick with the first three and you can't go wrong.",1073865600,2,1037,4.586956521739131

Some people may really like this movie but I prefer the previous sequels to this one. PEACE OUT.,1072483200,2,395,4.28
36197,4,0780630874,"This was definitely the second best Nightmare film, next to Dream Warriors. It had a solid protagonist in Alice, a dramatic showdown between good and evil and an excellent beginning(the death of the Dream Warriors) and some cool scenes in between.
There is a real sense of conflict and tension that resonates throughout the movie, but unfortunately, is still a victim of its own willingness to ""live down"" to expectations, so to speak. Instead of even trying to establish Krueger as a frightening and repugnant antagonist, they basically go the nihilistic route of attempting to make the former child-killer the funny, likeable post-modern hero of the film. It was almost as if they figured ahead of time that they couldn't possibly succeed in making a truly good horror film and therefore shouldn't even try that angle.
Sorry, but former child-killers don't make for likeable comedians. And the stand-up comic version of Krueger really serves to water down the potential ""good vs. evil"" tension in the film.
But my biggest complaint about this film is the treatment of Dream Warriors Roland Kincaid, Kristen Parker and Joey Crussel. As fellow reviewer Josh has pointed out, these characters that people came to root for in the previous film are discarded like so much trash in  ""Dream Master"".
Far and away, the most interesting part of number 4 is the first twenty minutes or so, when the surviving Dream Warriors are picked off one by one. The idea of Krueger taking the Warriors out individually so that he doesn't have to face them as a group is pretty cool, but it could've--and should've--been drawn out much more than it was. Ideally, I think Krueger could've initially confronted the Warriors as a group and been driven off, at which point Freddy could then go about dividing and conquering. Whatever route was taken, it could been at least emphasized more and not been gone about so casually.
That of course, is assuming that the Dream Warriors should have been killed off in the first place, and I have to say, that group seemed to have ""recurring protagonists"" written all over them. That of course, would've been stretching the boundaries of the genre a bit, something the screen writers were apparently scared to death of.",1065744000,,2236,4.915343915343915
36198,3,0780630874,"After the surprisingly good Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, New Line once again resurrected Freddy Kruger to wreak bloody havoc.  The Dream Master finds our three survivors from Dream Warriors all getting picked off by a newly revived Freddy; and introduces us to Alice who now has Kristen's powers and poses a threat to Freddy.  Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) upped Part 3's ante with even more elaborate, gorey, and macabre set pieces and deaths; some of which are the best in the series.  However, this is where Freddy stopped being scary and became the one liner spewing fiend that he is known (and loved) for; but either way Robert Englund is still a joy to watch as everyone's favorite razor clawed killer.  Dream Master also lacks the character development and coherent (well, more or less) storytelling that most of the other installments contained, but on it's own this is a pretty solid horror flick.",1060214400,4,938,4.880503144654088
36199,4,0780630874,"Although this is when the series isn't at its scariest, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" is a very entertaining Freddy flick.  Creepy, violent... and even darkly funny at times, this movie is a great edition to the Freddy series.  It's not as good as the third, but it's still a terrific Freddy movie.
Kristen and the other two survivors from the third movie have the strangest feeling that Freddy isn't gone for good.  They're in a new town with new friends, but something doesn't seem right.  Kristen is having the same dreams about the haunted house that Freddy lived in.  It isn't long until Freddy's sprit rises from the grave once again, to seek revenge on the three survivors and unleash his bloodlust upon the new batch of teens that he has yet to meet.  Kristen's best friend, Alice, may be the key to stop Freddy once and for all, but Freddy might get to her before she even gets the chance to fight.
While it's not the scariest of the set, the fourth movie proves to be very entertaining and creepy.  It had a pretty good script, although the acting could've been better in some areas.  I noticed that the cinematography in this particular film was pretty outstanding.  It was light when it needed to be light, and it was dark when it needed to be dark.  And Robert Englund once again plays his role with perfection.  This time he has a little more freedom to be funnier than in the past films.  He makes the movie what it is, and it would've been a horrible mess if he were not in it.
The DVD doesn't have the most explosive extras, although there is some DVD-ROM content that will make computer fanatics happy.  The picture looks great and the sound is really something to hear.  You can watch it in Dolby Digital or in the original theatrical stereo mix.  There's also cast and crew bios you can check out, as well.
""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" is really a good Freddy film that doesn't disappoint.  It may not be as strong as 1 and 3, but it still has that same edge and touch.  And it isn't overly goofy, although it is funnier than the past ones.  If you're a ""Nightmare"" fan, then I recommend you checking it out.

The new Kristen, Tuesday Knight, stunk.  She overemphasized emotions way too much and became an annoyance as a result.  Thank God that only lasted about a quarter of the film, if that.
I can watch this repeatedly and become more pleased with the visual effects each time.  I love the way the movie was shot and how the story became centered around Alice (after the last three kids of the parents who originally killed Freddy were bumped off).",1054252800,,676,4.752136752136752

36213,4,0780630874,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master continues off of the relativly popular Elm Street 3. The survivors of part 3 make brief, but notible appearence in this movie. Sadly, Patricia Arquette did not return to reprise her role as Kristen. However, Tuesday Knight plays the role respectfully. Adding the appearence of the former Dream Warriors adds a much enjoyable sense of continuity to the storyline. As all the Nightmare movies tend to do, we are introduced to a new group of kids who have the unfortunate luck of living in Springwood. However, since Kristen soon becomes the last surviving Elm Street kid, Freddy is out of a job unless he can somehow reach more kids. He forces young Kristen to bring shy new character, Alice, into her dream. Soon, Alice is bestowed with Kristen's ability to bring people into her dreams. Freddy jumps from kid to kid and begins the hell he usually causes. Like part 3, this movie's death scenes are elaborate and more fancy than part 1 & 2's simple slashings. The movie manages to take a select few new characters and build them up just long enough for them to run into Freddy. Sadly, the under-developed co-stars are the ones who survive the battle.
Overall, the story line is about a good as you can expect from a horror sequel. A movie made at the peek of Freddy-fever, this movie manages to entertain with a more lighthearted Freddy. The actors do a decent job and the 80's music adds a sense of nostalgia for anyone over the age of 15.",1024012800,7,1485,4.586466165413534

This movie is special to me because it was the first Freddy movie I saw in theaters. I was instantly hooked. The movie is a great carnival ride filled with stylish direction by Renny Harlin.

True, it does contain more humor, and some of the acting is not great, but I think the story line was great.  I thought all of the praise should go to Lisa Wilcox (Alice).  She was definetly my favorite character.  Alice was kind of an outcast, who often daydreamed about how her life could be, or what she wished it to me.  And her character has an excellent development through this whole movie.  It's a more realistic movie than the other ones,  its about a person who comes to terms with their fears.

36225,4,0780630874,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master is a very, very good entry in this awesome horror series.
The film picks up a few years after Dream Warriors. Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), Joey (Rodney Eastman), and Kristen (no longer Patricia Arquette, but Tuesday Knight) are living in their own homes now, no longer the mental hospital. They're pretty happy until Kristen has a nightmare and pulls Joey and Kincaid into it. They just get mad because Freddy Kreuger's nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, Alice (Lisa Wilcox), Kristen's good freind, has a lot to worry about at home. Her father's an alcoholic and takes his anger out on her and her brother, Rick.
Soon, Freddy is revived (in a very interesting way, I might add) and kills both Joey and Kincaid. When Kristen finds out about this, she tries hard to stay awake, but when her mother sneaks sleeping pills into her drink, she eventually fails. Freddy forces her to pull Alice into her dream, and Alice witnesses her getting burned up. However, Kristen transports her powers into Alice, and, as Freddy kills off all of her freinds one by one, Alice gains the strenths.
Nightmare On Elm Street 4 is a very good, well crafted, well written and directed, thriller that never lets up on its excitement or its fun. Directed quite well by Renny Harlin (The Foot Shooting Party, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), who brings to the film a classy look, with some brilliant camera movements, and some cool death sequences. Most of the actors in this film do quite good, most noticably Lisa Wilcox as Alice. Of course, Robert Englund's terrific as the one, the only, Freddy! This is the point where he gets funny instead of scary, as he's cracking off one-liners nearly every second. He's still not quite as goofy or cartoony as he'll become in Freddy's Dead. But I don't mind either Freddy. The scary Freddy's cool, and the funny one's cool, too. Also, look for Robert Shaye (the films producer) in one scene as a teacher lecturing on dreams.
The DVD is pretty good (I own the box set). There's good picture quality to take your breath away. You've just gotta get down on your hands and knees and thank the good lord that these movie's aren't owned by Paramount. Because, they would never go out in a box set. They'd never have any special features, and the picture and sound would be horrible. Thank God that Paramount rejected these movies. Anyway, you also get two audio options, original mono, and 5.1 surround (YES!!!). Extra features incclude a ""Jump To A Nightmare"" scene navigation, cast and crew biographies as well as the standard scene selection and english subtitles. For DVD-Rom you can read the script while watching the movie, and also play the dream warriors trivia game. If you're playing this trivia game to unlock the eigth disk in the box set, don't get excited. The codes don't work when you type them in on that disk. Anyway, the only difference here from the box set is that you get BOTH a 1:85:1 widescreen anamorphic format and a 1:66:1 standard version. I still have trouble seeing why people would even want to watch a movie in standard, you can't see anything! Also is a cool trailer.
Well, all in all, this is a great movie, on a good DVD. I'd say you should buy this, but really, just get the box set. You'll be happy you did! [...]",994982400,3,3314,4.6281833616298815

36228,3,0780630874,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master is the first of the Nightmare movies to use a lot of special effects. The first 3 stuck with prosthetics and animatronics, and Nightmare 4 went with special effects. Some of it was corny (The meatball heads), and some of it was outstanding (The roach girl).
 The story begins with Kristen (Who is now played by Tuesday Knight) and the two other surviving ""Dream Warriors"" Joey and Kincaid. She explains how she thinks Freddy is coming back. Joey and Kincaid tell her to forget it, he's dead. Welp, he's later risen by Kincaid's dog urinating fire on his grave in a dream, and Freddy succeeds in killing Kincaid. Freddy then offs Joey, and subsequently Kristin. This is what I didn't like about Nightmare 4. They are easily killed by Freddy in this one when they were strong enough to survive in earlier. It confused me, but I guess it was crucial to the storyline. In between their demises, we're introduced to a whole new group of kids. None of them are Elm Street kids, but Freddy decides he wants more souls so he used Kristin to pull one of her friends into the Freddy's dream world so he can continue his soul getting. The fried Kristin pulls in is Alice. Alice has a special talent that she doesn't know about. She's able to accept her friend's real talents and instincts when they are killed by Freddie. The final battle between Alice and Freddy is one of the best final confrontations out of all of the Nightmare movies. (Excluding New Nightmare.)
 The acting by Tuesday Knight was, in the least, horrible. I wish Patricia could've come back. The others faired well,and you cared for some of them. Lisa Wilcox, the gal who played Alice, really shined. She made Alice my favorite Nightmare heroine. Robert Englud returns as Freddy, but Freddy returns as a wise-cracking bumbling idiot. There's no more mystery or darkness to the character anymore. That was a downfall.
 In conclusion, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master took a couple of steps down from NOES3, but the ending made up for the whole movie.",992304000,4,2069,4.616847826086956

I like this one, too, even though this is about as close to camp horror the series had gotten. Freddy is as cool as ever, but as I knew he would eventually be, he is now a character instead of an idea, and he has enough wise-cracks to give Andrew Dice Clay an entire show to work with. I know that I'm criticizing more than I'm praising, but let me just say that this is one of the most stylish entries in the series. Renny Harlin has an incredible talent for showing us something new, even with the contrivances in the script. There are many memorable sequences in this film, and it also introduces Freddy's most formidable adversary: The indomitable Alice. Lisa Wilcox is Alice, and she does a good job. Her character is the only one that really develops during the movie, but that's okay, because we know in our gut, right from the very beginning, that she's the one who will face off with him at the end. And with the trick camerawork and awesome visuals, it is quite a fight. Renny Harlin deserves a heck of a lot of credit. His style overcame the substance in this movie. As I always believed about movies: It's not what you do, but how you do it. Good job, Renny. Without you, this one would've been the end.",981417600,2,1365,4.377952755905512

The director, Harlin, was basically a no-name before this movie, but after its surprise success at the box office, the most profitable Nightmare flick up to this point, he went on to direct major Hollywood flicks, like Die Hard 2 (1990), Cliffhanger (1993), the doomed Cutthroat Island (1995) and Deep Blue Sea (1999). In an interview he laughed when asked about Nightmare 4, explaining  that he was basically hired to do a rush job due to the previous ones unexpected success (1988s A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors). The producers gave him a deadline, a small budget and a five-page outline for a screenplay. They obviously weren't concerned with the quality of the movie; they just wanted to put out another Nightmare as-soon-as-possible as a cash-grab. Harlin took the job; pretty much writing the dialogue as they moved along.

Winsome Tuesday Knight is a highlight, but her presence is never really capitalized on even though she has a beach scene (and Im not talking about nudity or porn). Still, her role is respectably beefy. Lisa Wilcox emerges as the protagonist and has a good story arc, but they coulda done more with her as well. Speaking of the women, pin-up girl and B-flick actress Hope Marie Carlton has a cameo.

There are some creative parts, like the cockroach and soul-pizza sequences. The movie perhaps works best as a period-piece of 1987 (when it was shot) and is surprisingly good in light of the challenge Harlin faced. Nevertheless, for me, its the least of the first four movies.

THE MOVIE RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in the Burbank/Los Angeles area, California.

7789861,3,0780630874,"The Dream Master is a mostly fun entry in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, but it's unfortunately much less satisfying and inspired than its predecessor, Dream Warriors. In this one, Kristen (Tuesday Knight) passes her dream mastery abilities on to her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox). As luck would have it, Freddy leverages Alice's newfound skills to terrorize the rest of their social circle. Freddy has some funny one-liners and there are some memorably scary and disgusting scenes, including one in a diner that could make you swear off pizza forever. All the same, after I watched Dream Warriors, I remember thinking ""I'm glad they tried to do something clever this time."" While watching this one, I thought ""I guess the producers felt they should make another one while the franchise is still profitable.""",1486598400,,810,5.052238805970149

7789863,3,0780630874,"I have recently embarked on a series wide reviewing of the entire Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. I recall seeing each and every one of them during their initial theatrical runs and hadn't seen any of them since (excepting for the first one). I thought it would be fun to revisit the series and see how they hold up. Well, again excepting for the first one, not very well actually...
Here we have part 4. First thought is, how did Renny Harlin ever make it as a film director? I'll leave it at that... What ""story"" we do have here is pretty thin and definitely disjointed...This feels more like a series of vignettes allowing for no other purpose than for Freddy's wisecracks and ""creative"" (read:corny) bloodletting. Those moments are, of course, much fun and a big part of the appeal, but the absence of any real story makes this feel much longer than its actual running time. I do really appreciate seeing Screaming Mad George's contributions so it earns a star for that fact alone. Still a fun time with a beer in hand, but I wouldn't go into this with any expectations of actual terror or fright....Poor Freddy had been reduced to a clown",1483574400,,1146,4.595121951219512
