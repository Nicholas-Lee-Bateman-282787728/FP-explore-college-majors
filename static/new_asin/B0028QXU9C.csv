8356688,3,B0028QXU9C,It was a well done biography.  The producers did their research and knew their subject.  They obviously had an interest in their subject.  Yet I was all about the teacher and nothing about the teachings.

8356689,5,B0028QXU9C,"I had opportunity to see this wonderful movie in big screen (a Ramana devotee projected this film on the tall walls of the SAT temple). I felt like I was at Sri Ramanasramam and feeling of devotion welled up within. All the attendees were moved by the film.

I requested a friend, Bob Haber, who liked the film very much to say few words so that I can add to the review. He wrote the following:
""The Eternal Light provides so beautiful a presentation of the life of Sri Ramana Maharshi. It is so intimate a view into the course of Bhagavan's life via its wonderful photography, narration, and background music, and also into the devoted lives of those who loved him, even as the film thus beautifully reflects the scaredness of India and its people. What a blessing it is for so many to now have the opportunity to see all of this live footage of the Maharshi, of where he lived, and of those blessed ones who lived with him!. Thank you!""",1255132800,12,938,4.390804597701149
