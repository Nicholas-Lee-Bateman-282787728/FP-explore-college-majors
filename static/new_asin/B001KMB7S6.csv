8315324,2,B001KMB7S6,"There are two films brought together on this one DVD. M2M Eyeball imitates video personals, with male2male hookups. Koverboyz is a short series of models from a male nudie magazine, with simulated masturbation. In both, there is full nudity, mostly from behind. There are brief glimpses of genitals, but just in passing, and flaccid only. This includes in the sex scenes. This is softcore, so there are no erections, no penetration, and no visible orgasms. A couple of the men are attractive, but most are mediocre (the picture on the cover does NOT appear in the actual video). The irony is that the most visibility was with the models who were the least attractive. The ones I most wanted to see were the ones who were blocked by strategically-placed obstacles. Dialogue is in Filipino (Tagalog, I assume), with English subtitles.",1412208000,2,832,4.95
8315325,4,B001KMB7S6,"this was a pretty good 2 films.  there is not a lot of frontal nudity as the discription says.  it still has some.  hopefully even newer films will
break the nudity barrier that these films haven't broken yet.
still, i think it was worth the money.",1234310400,4,248,4.3478260869565215
