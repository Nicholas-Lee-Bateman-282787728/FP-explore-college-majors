5839508,5,B00DOZNHZ8,Bettlejuice was my favorite cartoon as a kid and I still love it. This dvd is the Halloween episodes from the series so if you have the series already don't get it. If your interested in watching Bettlejuice and you can't afford the entire series this is a great place to start. If you love Tim Burton then you'll love this cartoon. I would recommend this for anyone 8 and older.,1418169600,15,379,4.352112676056338
