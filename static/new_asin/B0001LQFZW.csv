I have taken yoga lessons before and was pleasantly surprised to learn new things. His teaching method is so very effective!  The book does contain instructions for almost any other postures you would want to try.  I recommend it highly to those who want to stretch and become more limber or for those who need to get better sleep or to destress. I gave it a 4 only because the title might be a bit misleading; the content, however, is great.",1235174400,2,628,4.589285714285714

Did the DVD twice , the CD seveal times and have been reading the book cover to cover. This is a truly exceptional set in that it offers the avid Yogi (at any level), 3 things with the set:
1) DVD with several customized stretches and meditations on it. I find that I choose a one in the AM and one in the PM. The AM is more to get me going in the day and the PM, I select a meditation stretch and breathing exercise in order to relax my mind and my muscles. After the PM, I sleep much more deeply and wake up the next day refreshed and then do the AM Yoga.
2) The CD is classical and relaxing music for relaxation and meditation. This is great for sleep or just as a quick relaxation during the day.
3) The Yoga Book, which is the BEST YOGA INFO for all levels that I have ever seen! This book has several interviews with Rodney Yee where he goes into detail about Yoga and Meditation and equipment (clothes, mat, blanket, blocks), even how to properly fold the blanket for Yoga practice. The best part of the book is the very THROUGH explanation of the Yogi positions, complete with pictures and full details of the correct positions and how long to hold them. In addition, there are several CUSTOM Yoga workouts, such as ABS, LEGS, ALL OVER, etc. I have already customized some Yoga sessions to the part of the body that I wish to work on and use the CD in this set--this way, I can take my CD and book with me anywhere and do the exercises when I do not wish to watch the DVD. This is wonderful for when I travel. **This DVD/CD/BOOK is IDEAL for ANY LEVEL of YOGI. I am now a intermediate going into more advanced, yet I believe that it will work for begineers to advanced!",1185840000,12,1774,4.159883720930233
