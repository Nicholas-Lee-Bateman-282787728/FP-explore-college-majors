8458513,5,6305869529,Probably no other director has made as many long form music videos as Don Barrett.  The Wonderful Planet was commissioned as an Earthday tribute to our home world.  Shot on all seven continents it depicts a natural world that is quickly disappearing.  Especially noteworthy is Forest of the Amazon; a reminder of what is happening to the great rain forest.  I loved it and so did my children,980899200,,391,4.705882352941177
8458514,1,6305869529,I was very dissapointed with the quality of the dvd.  It was grainy and looked like old footage from public tv specials spliced together.,976060800,2,137,4.708333333333333
8458515,5,6305869529,"A musical video to Earth, The Wonderful Planet was actually shot in film on all seven continents.  It begins with an overture, a 15 billion light year journey to Earth.  Subsequent chapters deal with ""The Land"", ""Endangered Species"", ""Forest of the Amazon"", ""A World of Color"", ""Waltz of the Flowers"" and the Grand Finale.
The Wonderful Planet reminds us of the precision world in which we live.
Director Don Barrett's editing work is superb, especially in ""Forest of the Amazon"".  The 35mm film original really pops with color.  A beautiful DVD!!!",967593600,2,548,4.989010989010989
