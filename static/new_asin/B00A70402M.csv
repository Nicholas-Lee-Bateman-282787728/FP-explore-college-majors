5391699,5,B00A70402M,"Park Shin Hye is a tremendously gifted actress. What I did not know was that her amazing talent  was evident, from early in her career. Because of it, this movie is intriguing and fascinating. Whenever Park Shin Hye appears on the screen, she captivates her audience, and makes whatever role she is playing totally believable. Something else I learned from this movie is how versatile an actress she is. Park Shin Hye has the ability to make any script and character come alive! In this movie, she plays complicated characters that few actresses have the talent to portray.",1412726400,,573,4.846938775510204
5391700,4,B00A70402M,I enjoyed it a lot.  It was more low budget but really well done.  I loved the costumes and how it was a period driven horror film.,1411084800,,131,3.814814814814815
5391701,5,B00A70402M,"The English translations really are terrible and sometimes way too fast. That aside, the story was very enjoyable and the ending more pleasing than I expected of an evil twin movie. I agree with another viewer which said the scenery was beautiful.",1402099200,2,247,4.904761904761905
5391702,2,B00A70402M,"This beautifully made and shot movie, typical of the genre (i.e. evil spirits/ghosts) suffers from truly terrible subtitling.  Some subtitles make no sense, others that are longer appear and disappear so fast I had to keep stopping, going back and pausing to be able to read the entire thing.  A shame really, otherwise as I say, while typical of the genre, seems to have been well-done.",1390694400,3,387,4.848484848484849
5391703,4,B00A70402M,"This is a good movie: great music and sound, spooky scenery, beautiful costumes, and a poignant story. The English in the subtitles, however, is so bad as to make the story line unintelligible. So shortly into the film I went to the Wikipedia article (Evil Twin (film)), got the story there and then enjoyed the rest of the movie. The story takes place I'm guessing in the 19th century.",1377388800,4,386,4.608695652173913
5391704,3,B00A70402M,did anyone watch this? i skipped around and wasn't sure sure the quality of the movie. didn't want to watch the whole thing. anyone know what its like?,1374883200,,151,4.428571428571429
5391705,4,B00A70402M,"A 2007 South Korean horror flick that was pretty good. Of course, in my opinion most horror films coming out from South Korea are pretty damn good, for the most part. I'm a big fan of asian horror, South Korea and Japan being my favorite countries in that genre, Thailand being right behind them. But anyways this film is simple and creepy at the same time. About a twin who has been in a coma for 10 years after an accident with her twin drowning to death. When the twin in a coma finally wakes up, is she really the twin alive or the twin that's dead? Very nice story and very well done.",1359590400,7,589,4.175438596491228

5391728,1,B00A70402M,"Whoever translated the English subtitles needs to be fired, the english text made no sense whatsoever, ruining the entire movie",1441152000,2,127,5.4
5391729,2,B00A70402M,"More people need to understand that the high ratings on this movie should NOT be there. The atrocious English sub titles are un forgivable. That the cinematography and pretty props are well done does not make up for the fact that the movie is just not understandable, not even through intuition.",1436832000,3,295,4.803921568627451
5391730,2,B00A70402M,"Nothing original, not scary, and terrible subtitles riddled with grammar errors.",1436313600,,80,6.363636363636363
5391731,5,B00A70402M,"Incredible story, great costuming, great actors, perfect score. The subtitles make it very difficult to understand. You need to follow the emotions to get a clear understanding. Try to struggle through it as the story line is well worth it.",1427500800,2,240,5.025
5391732,5,B00A70402M,"A really good Korean ""horror"" that isn't terrifying.",1420416000,,52,5.625
5391733,2,B00A70402M,"Boring movie; could barely pay attention to it. I was expecting more to happen because of this movie's high rating on Amazon. Comments about the subtitles were spot on -- they were terribly done and much of it didn't make sense. My favorite nonsensical subtitle: ""Its me to cry for quarter! not you! you know that?"" (and that was at the beginning of the movie so you know it will be a long haul)",1419379200,4,395,4.351351351351352
5391734,5,B00A70402M,"I'm personally used to subtitling foibles, so the occasional problems with the subtitling here didn't bother me much. It's relatively easy to understand this story contextually, and there's always the option of taking a quick look at the wikipedia on it as another reviewer did. Since the movie otherwise featured solid acting, beautiful shots, gorgeous costuming and was overall fun and interesting to watch, I'll still give this 5 stars. A very nice period horror piece.",1417478400,,472,5.223684210526316
5391735,4,B00A70402M,I love it especially the ending! She's been always good in acting.,1415750400,,66,4.583333333333333
8547572,4,B00A70402M,Good movie. Not bad at all. Enjoyed it. Love a good Asian story with a good ending. I've seen worse . But this one gets 4 stars. No more no less,1493942400,,144,3.6774193548387095
8547573,5,B00A70402M,"Park Shin Hye was only 17-year-old at that time, but she ready did a pretty good job!
I watched it twice in order to get the completed story line.",1493942400,,146,4.068965517241379
8547574,5,B00A70402M,"The movie is well done.  The story line is interesting and the actors did a great job acting.  I really enjoyed watching it.  The subtitles could be done better, but this review is about the movie and not its subtitles.  Evil Twin is a great movie to watch.  I will certainly recommend it.",1481673600,,289,4.377358490566038

8547576,3,B00A70402M,"This movie was a little difficult to follow, I only speak a little bit of korean, so I rely pretty heavily on subtitles. For this movie the subtitles needed a lot of improvement. For me there were even parts where there wasn't even any subtitles. The movie itself was pretty interesting, but the story was kind of hard to get into/hard to follow.",1473724800,3,346,4.507936507936508

8547579,4,B00A70402M,"The subtitles is a bit off.  Enjoyed the movie especially Park Shin Hye's acting.  It is interesting to see how her acting has progressed throughout the years, from Evil Twin, Heirs, The Royal Tailor, and Pinocchio. Look forward to more acting from her.",1461801600,,253,4.8604651162790695
