8765158,1,B01HDHA9G2,You know you've stumbled across something special when you're already irritated and bored with a film before the opening credits finish.  I'm not sure if the actors sucked or it was just the writing (probably both) and stupid quirky music that's supposed to make us believe the interaction between characters is funny or witty. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this poor excuse for a movie.,1506902400,2,400,4.797101449275362

8765160,1,B01HDHA9G2,"The pros: Interesting premise I don't recall seeing before. Decent post-production. Good use of indie funding.

The cons: Pretty much every other aspect of the film. Terrible acting, especially the ""American"" dude. Insipid and unnatural dialogue. Unsympathetic characters I cared nothing about. Glacial first act. Zero chemistry between any of the characters. Illogical in many places ... six people who don't shower for a week and ingest nothing but beer and snack food look like supermodels throughout.

In general, avoid.",1505606400,,524,5.5375
8765161,2,B01HDHA9G2,"Six young adults from different nations vacation in a home in France with some crude humor and semi-funny dialogue. After a poor introduction they find a VCR and tapes and play the tapes of old cult films. In the morning they discovered a tape in the machine based on a genre mixing of the previous two tapes (""Cowboys vs. Zombies."") Then for a lengthy bit of time we get to watch actual old cult films that were genre mixing. When they discover a VHS camera and they can make a tape of themselves and play in said merger VHS machine, that's when things become an issue and not as fun as it should have been.

The film was uneven. It had some good scenes and a lot of scenes in the ""need improvement"" category. Girls were cute.

Guide: F-word. Nudity on old films...""Invasion of Bee Girls"" etc.",1489449600,,794,4.394557823129252
