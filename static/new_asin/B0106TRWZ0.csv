8721458,1,B0106TRWZ0,"This is not even a remotely good deal at the current $116 price. You can get the four Alien films in the Alien Anthology for $25, the 3 Predator films in an ""Own the moments"" triple pack for $15. I don't know who would want to own the lousy AvP films, but if you do I'm sure they can be had for less than $10 each. So that's less than half of this bundle's price.",1436572800,2,363,3.8533333333333335
