8462263,4,B0058U3SF6,"What they give you in this set is fine, other than lack of background audio in a couple of episodes. However, my main issue is that I've recently discovered that this does not have all the episodes as it claims. This show consists of three seasons with overall 39 episodes, plus the holiday special. This set is missing the entire third season.",1436400000,,344,4.564516129032258

8462265,5,B0058U3SF6,"First of all the discription is all wrong. The above discription is for Frankiinstein's Cat. The picture is the right listing. This is the details:
These are big adventures from a very small perspective-that of a brave mouse named Eckhart, who has an irrepressible curiosity and sense of wonder about the mysteries of his world. Enjoy all 27 half hour episodes of this renowned family series which explores and celebrates the pioneering spirit and the joys and the challenges of growing up! One of which is the pilot ""The True Meaning of Crumbfest"". It is a Christmas episode, but the mice don't call it Christmas, they call it Chrumbfest. Besides the pilot there are 26 episodes. They have the pilot as the last episode as if it was a bonus. No other special features. This is a 3 disc set with 9 episodes on each disc. The packaging is a double standard case with a third disc in an envelope inside the case. It is fullscreen and is 621 minutes in length although I have never timed it. I am taking the boxes word for it. !!!Warning Parents: It is rated ""G"", but you have to judge whether your younger children should watch because there are some kid scary moments like a scary cat going after the mice. And a pretending to be friending fox locking the mice up in her house and threatening to eat them. But Eckhart and Sir Roswald (A Skunk) get there in time to save them, ect. Some kids might not be able to handle it. Some probably could You Parents have to judge!!.
!!!Warning: These episodes are edited as far as the opening goes. There is only an opening on the first episode and then after the episodes go directly to the next title page and episode. There is no closing
until last episode on each disc. The only exception is the ""The True Meaning of Crumbfest"" which has both the opening and closing. I know there are a lot of you who are not going to like that, so I am warning you now!!! Even in the episodes in the indivdual episode page there aren't any opening.
It is in English and Spanish.",1349654400,,2005,4.421621621621622
