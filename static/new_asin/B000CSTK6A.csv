2473840,4,B000CSTK6A,"I love the America's Castles series - and wish that A&E would continue to produce quality programming like this instead of the many tacky reality series that now make up their programming like Family Jewels and Storage Wars.

""California Dreamers"" concentrates on two homes - the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California and Scotty's Castle in Palm Desert, taking viewers on an inside view of both of them.  Of the two, the Winchester story is the more fascinating.

Legend has it that Sarah Winchester, heir to the Winchester rifle fortune, feared the spirits of all the people who were killed by Winchester rifles and thought that she would find peace and eternal life if she continued to build a sprawling home filled with endless staircases and doors (often leading to nowhere) windows (sone in the middle of a room and facing the floor), and ornamental turrets and observation decks, often in competing architectural styles.  Construction abruptly stopped upon her death, and many materials still in the attic prove that her building had no end in sight.

Scotty's Castle by contrast is more of a spanish-style villa than a mansion, and the man behind the building, eccentric con artist Walter Edward Scott, is the more fascinating subject, which is interesting since the home was actually built and owned by businessman Albert Johnson, Scott's friend and one time victim.  The home hosted many Holywood parties in the 1920's, and the depression halted additional construction on the home. Despite their rocky start, the two remained life long friends, and in Johnson's will, he requested that Scott be allowed to remain living in the home until his death (he is buried on site).",1294012800,5,1692,5.025
2473841,3,B000CSTK6A,"I bought this because of the Winchester House. There's not much in the way of books on the subject and I'll never get to California so this DVD is as close as I'll get to the actual house. I wish it had more footage of the interior though. Lots of talk about the Winchester rifle and Sarah but I hoped to see more of the house. I've always love the America's Castle series on A&E but this one didn't show as much as others have.

Scotty's Castle is interesting and again, it talks a lot about the people in it but they show more interior footage than they did for Winchester House. A bit disappointing but with so little information out there on this subject, I'll keep it. I bought it at a great price so I can live with the short 50 minutes this DVD shows me.",1181520000,17,761,4.141891891891892

I stand by my comments on ""Winchester Explored"" and now on ""California Dreamers"", which includes ""Scotty's Castle"". Both are fascinating places that only Imagination and Deep Pockets can create.",1462320000,,255,5.4

8102121,5,B000CSTK6A,"This is a really good program that talks about two of California's ""Castles"". It's only one of the episodes in the series, but a good one at that.
Feature showcases ""The Winchester Mystery House"" in San Jose, Ca., and ""Scotty's House"" in Death Valley, Ca.

An eccentric named Sarah Winchester inherited her husband's fortune from the sale of the Winchester Rifle in the 1800s. She continually built on a farm house in 1884 San Jose, expanding it 24/7 until she passed away in her sleep from heart failure in late 1922. All original building stopped at that point. Looks more at the outside of the mansion then inside. I found TWO other programs that have more footage of the inside of this mansion:
""California Ghosts"" that features 5 distinct places in Ca. and The Winchester House is one of them, great segment on the inside of it hosted by a tour guide at the time working there.
""The Winchester Mystery House Discovered"" which is done entirely by the estate itself and does a fabulous job of showcasing the place in less than a half hour.

A Massive Spanish Style Castle built through the alliance between Walter Scott and Millionaire Albert Johnson. A beautiful place in the Ca. Desert and well talked about.

This program runs about 50 minutes in length. Well done.",1436659200,2,1271,4.716216216216216
