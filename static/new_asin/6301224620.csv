Trying to create a perfect commune society.  The issues involved between everyone giving up their possessions and 'freedom' to be FREE; and someone having to be in power to make final decisions.",1418688000,,338,5.222222222222222

324719,4,6301224620,"I saw this movie by chance just before I traveled to Israel to volunteer on a kibbutz for several months. I found it an informative dramatization of the pioneers of the kibbutzim, the Jews who left Europe and Russia in the early 1900s to build a Zionist home in the British-controlled holy land.
At that time Jewish immigrants were as scattered and as powerless in the land as their Bedouin neighbors. But you can already see the suspicions and rivalry that would build into the Israel/Palestine feud.
The Jews returning to the land dug a nation out of the rock and arid soil, and you can get a sense from this movie how difficult that was, yet what vision and persistence those people had.
The band of settlers in this story meet up with a Sephardic Jew, one whose ancestors had never left the land and who looks as Arabic as the Bedouin. He is religious, the immigrants are secular, not to mention communist. It's amazing how the body politic of Israel has changed from those early days of the returning Diaspora.",1062720000,4,1015,4.582417582417582

7810916,5,6301224620,If this is based on a true story it certainly shows the atrocities the Jews have lived through and are still living through. Most of the stories about Jews do not have a happy ending; this story does not have a happy ending. This story explains the peril of trying to leave God out of your life circumstances.,1463270400,,309,4.344827586206897

7810920,2,6301224620,"This film was about early settlement by some young Jewish people who established a commune for the purpose of farming and reclaiming the land.  Looking at this film from an agrarian standpoint, the film missed the mark totally.  It was too much about frolicking, dancing, and worrying about procreating.  The main issue should have been survival and making things grow with a lot of hard work and ingenuity needed and the film failed to show that adequately.  There were sections in the film where one was left wondering what on earth was going on.  The Arabic dialogue had no captions, so a person was supposed to ""figure it out.""  Maybe this film was cut, I don't know, but when you see what Israel has done to re-green the desert and what was involved, this film came off like a fairy tale without any real substance and lack of agrarian detail.  Of course, that is from my perspective as a farmer.  Questioning how in less than a year, they managed to acquire sheep and were supposedly harvesting crops that the film maker failed to even mention.  At the end a tree that had been planted just a few months prior from a sapling was miraculously half mature and in full bloom.  Hmmmm",1431388800,4,1185,4.57345971563981
