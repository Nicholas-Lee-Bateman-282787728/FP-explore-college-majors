8129366,5,B000G8NXSW,"one of the best from image entertainments finely restored ""gene autry collection"". great cast of supporting characters and all classic songs. although five stars should be reserved for classic westerns such as ""shane"", this deserves a five star rating because of who gene autry was and what he represented. bonus features also a definite plus.",1248307200,4,343,5.254545454545455
8129367,5,B000G8NXSW,"After guest starring in Ken Maynard's feature IN OLD SANTA FE (1934) and serial MYSTERY MOUNTAIN (1934) Gene was given the chance to star in Mascot's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE (1935) when the studio cut ties with the troublesome Maynard. And even though he sang a few songs as an entertainer in IN OLD SANTA FE and the setting for that film was a contemporary Dude Ranch, it's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE that really set up the AUTRY-STYLE as Gene hosts a radio show broadcast live from his own radio/guest/dude ranch mixing his action feats with popular Western tunes. Truly a milestone in B-Western history!
TUMBLING TUMBLEWEEDS (1935) for the newly formed REPUBLIC PICTURES is Gene's first starring feature, and what a doozie it is, ranking as one of Gene's all time best, and rightfully so.
Lazy and seemingly idle Gene just likes to sit around and sing while his father has to battle intruding nesters. But Gene is really on the ball and sticks up for the nesters only to quarrel with his father and be banished from the homestead. Gene joins a medicine show and returns five years later only to learn that his best friend has been blamed for the recent murder of his father...Gene and Smiley Burnette sort things out with the help of a pre-Gabby George Hayes.
This is a GREAT REPUBLIC WESTERN skillfully directed by Joe Kane. The camera set-ups are outstanding, the photography crisp and inventive. It seems so modern for the 1930's. Few films today are so creatively made. Truly a joy to watch!
And the IMAGE dvd from the GENE AUTRY COLLECTION is as noted on the cover: FULLY RESTORED! It looks as though it had been released yesterday! I really felt as though I were present in the theater in 1935 watching this gem.
...Just a side note here in that I want to mention B-WESTERN vetern Jack Rockwell's outstanding performance as McWade. Rockwell played in countless B-WESTERNS during his long career, often as a henchmen but also on the side of the law as well, and this is one of his better outings, if only a personal favorite of mine...
All said, a fantastic start for Gene Autry on to a career that would make him perhaps the greatest Western film star of all time.
SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!",1205020800,11,2191,4.664082687338501
8129368,5,B000G8NXSW,"This was Gene Autry's first feature-length starring movie, and his acting is just a little stilted in a few places. But overall, he takes charge of this classic tale of ranchers vs. nesters just like the pro he quickly became. His scenes with the two lovely young women are especially relaxed and natural.

Autry looks as young and fresh as a daisy in ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" although he's still got a little baby fat on him that had pretty much disappeared by his movies made in early 1937. It's funny how if you watch his early movies in chronological order, you can see him gradually slim down at the same time his wardrobe sharpens up and his horsemanship on Champ goes from passably adequate to effortlessly expert.

Gene's singing wasn't quite yet what it became later, but nevertheless there's nothing wrong with his pipes as he performs three western classics during the movie: the title song; ""Riding Down the Canyon;"" and the song for which he won the first-ever gold record: ""That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine.""

As the other reviewer mentioned, George Hayes, not yet Gabby, shows his versatility in this flick as the pompous, phony-dignified medicine show ""doctor."" Smiley Burnette gives samples of the humor and tunes he'll offer in future Autry movies.

This is an expert blend -- just the right proportions of drama, comedy, music and action. The first singing cowboy movie was a great start to a great genre. It's well worth watching.",1189555200,6,1449,4.878048780487805

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.
