6759804,4,B00OQUZQZO,"I am a huge fan of American Horror Story. However since season 1, though seasons 2 and 3 have been good in their own right, is lacking one key element...horror. This season (season 4) is much the same as the others, but a bit better. It's turning out to be more murder mystery than horror story. Don't get me wrong, love the show. Just not much horror in it.",1415836800,10,358,4.202898550724638
6759805,5,B00OQUZQZO,"loving this season so far, its back to being as good as asylum was, coven was not so great in my opinion, my only complaint of this season is that one girl actor they had in coven and now they brought back for this season, the blonde emma or whatever that actresses name is that is, the fake fortune teller in this season, and the last was the one who was killed and brought back, she does not flow with the feel of these series and kinda throws it off for me. that being said this season is great so far, and I bought the first 2 on dvd and I will not buy coven, it was not well written and it was kinda not as good as the normal American horror story series is, freak show is great and it rivals with how great asylum was. so yeah, Ill be buying this one on dvd when it comes out.",1415664000,3,782,3.89375
6759806,5,B00OQUZQZO,"yess! I love this show it's getting better and better each season, I started watching AHS on Netflix and I have been hooked ever since, I can't wait for each episode of this series. I tell you what this has been the scariest season I have ever seen, all I can say is that before watching this show I was never EVER afraid of clowns but now I give them the side eye! Loving it and I can't wait for this to come out on dvd. Wow! I can not believe how it ended, that was so unexpected I can not wait for next season. I know that there will be plenty of twist and turns for next season because I know it can't be over. This season was a definite change up from all the previous seasons but I liked (again) how each character basically reoccurred in this season just like before and their characters were just as sassy as before. I am keeping my fingers crossed that next season will be just as good or better than this season.",1415059200,36,922,4.099447513812155

6759808,5,B00OQUZQZO,"Being a huge AHS fan, I know that every season is unique and wonderful on its own way. And ""Freak Show, AHS' fourth season, is not the exception.
As any other AHS season, every episode is an amazing episode, it always has great writing and of course and finally some horror back (which was almost completely absent on Coven). With AHS: Freak Show you're always wondering what's going to happen next, the performances by the returning cast are great, with Kathy Bates, Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Emma Roberts, just to mention some of the best actors of the series. The cinematography is wonderful, and the whole atmosphere this fourth season brings is unique and definetely becomes one of the best seasons of this series.
There's gore, screaming, shocking twists that make us fans screaming at our screen too, but it also shows the vulnerability of the characters, this is so much more than just a ""horror"" show, you get to know every character so deeply, even with just five minutes of their back-story. One thing I also liked about this season were the musical numbers, each one is unique, and they fit the story perfectly; each one of them has a purpose on the story, and it's good to see some of the cast singing again, my favorite has to be ""Gods and Monsters"".
Overall, I think that this season is amazingly done, and once I get the DVD, I'll watch it all over again! Can't wait for the season finale which is airing next Wednesday, because AHS never dissapoints, and I can't wait to see what's next for this wonderful series. It's worth the pre-order!",1414627200,15,1561,4.6389891696750905

6759817,3,B00OQUZQZO,I purchased the first three seasons last year on Black Friday and just now decided to binge watch it. As I started the third season I was eager to continue so ordered season 4. I had high expectations but from the first episode I was highly disappointed. The season was just not the same as the previous ones and was hard to follow and really pay attention to. It actually bore me at times. The second disc even had spots that did not work and t was a brand new sealed disc. I don't know what the writers were thinking but they really went down hill this time.,1510790400,,560,4.194444444444445

6759820,3,B00OQUZQZO,"Started off good, the clown was pretty creepy as many have mentioned. The problem comes later when it seems that the season has no idea which direction it wants to go. It's all about the clown, all about Elsa Mars, Jimmy's long lost dad Dell, the con artists, the twins, Dandy the serial killer, and then it kind of flails about from the midpoint until it hastily wraps up during the last two episodes. Ugh, and if I had to listen to Jessica Lange sing again. Wasn't a bad season but it was quite a let down after a strong start. Blew it's load in the first four episodes.",1509148800,,572,4.256880733944954

6759843,5,B00OQUZQZO,"Next to Murder House and Coven, Freakshow became another one of my fan favorite seasons for American Horror Story!

Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Angela Bassett and Jyoti Amge's performances in Freakshow were incredible and I love this series' theme of morality. I also enjoyed how actors and actresses with qualities a regular person would seem strange - like Jyoti, Mat Fraser and Rose Siggins - are involved, making Freakshow authentic. I think because of that, many people who are misunderstood and have quirks society wouldn't understand will enjoy watching this season of American Horror Story!

This season makes you ask: Who are the real monsters? The members of Elsa's Cabinet of Curiosities, or people no one would suspect of committing unspeakable acts?",1494374400,,777,5.258064516129032

6759876,4,B00OQUZQZO,"Jessica Lange is the best thing in the show. Her German accent never gets fake or tired. Lots of style and flashy color but little content. Yes, a vicious psycho clown wanders in and out of the plot to give the show a jolt of menace. But haven't we seen the psycho clown thing before?

Writers and producers seem to be showing that current movies and rock videos evolved out of and replaced the carny and freak shows that vanished in the early 50's because of TV shows. It's fun and cheesy but it uses subtext to mask its lack of real originality. The use of freaks as a metaphor for civil rights issues is not very original either. I bought it at WalMart for $9.96. That's a fair price, but I can't say it's worth more than $10.",1480809600,,729,4.244604316546763
6759877,5,B00OQUZQZO,"AHS has opened up a whole new genre of series as we wait for each new season, not knowing what will be in store. This by far is my favorite season. I am rather seared when it comes to horror as it is my favorite film style, but this was way beyond my expectations for a television produced series.
 In this years season it is circus themed. I won't give too much away, as I want you to enjoy it as I did, but I'll tell you one thing. They used actual people (circus type) for some of the actors. As for the special effects....when I first saw the 2 headed girl they had me wondering how they did it so flawlessly! It is fast paced and you cannot miss one single episode. I have watched the whole series so far, and this is the one that really strikes me as smooth flowing and you feel the story in it's entirety. I have enjoyed all of them, (this years, Roanoake) left me disappointed). IMHO Roanoake has been the worst, although I still am waiting for next round, next year. But if you want to just get one season I would highly recommend this season, (Freak Show). It really lives up to it's name, and I was even a little embarrassed at a few of the ""where no man has gone before"" moments. Making love with a ""freak"" is truly one of our cultural taboos. Well get over it, and watch this season! If they were all this good, I would buy the whole set. Truly weird, truly horrific! Love AHS!!!",1480723200,,1392,4.155555555555556

6759907,4,B00OQUZQZO,"Most loyal AMERICAN HORROR STORY fans consider the fourth season, titled FREAK SHOW to be the weakest one so far, and after binge watching it on Blu Ray, I can see their point.  While the seasons setting, a circus like show of oddities in the Florida of 1952, is the perfect venue for a creepy story, it all somehow falls short of the high bar set by previous seasons, especially ASLYUM. FREAK SHOW has everything going for it: outrageous characters portrayed by A-list talent and plenty of convoluted and everything including the kitchen sink plotting, it just doesnt add up to a completely satisfying whole.

I believe the big problem is in the writing, which was strong on setting up an intriguing premise with great possibility, but simply could not pay it off at the seasons end.  This has been a problem for many continuing narrative shows, but it should not be for AMERICAN HORROR STORY since it is an anthology that tells a complete story from beginning to end each season.  Also, the supernatural element that has been overwhelming part of the plots of each previous season, is noticeably absent in FREAK SHOW, except for the Halloween appearance of Edward Mordrake.  Not that there wasn't plenty of horror to mined from the same ground Tod Browning trod in his classic 1932 movie, FREAKS, the obvious inspiration for this season.

As always, each season of AHS has a theme and FREAK SHOWs could best be described as the search for family and belonging, especially by people who do not fall under the umbrella of what society considers normal.  All of the denizens of Elsa Marss show-the bearded lady, the seal man, the pinheads, the legless woman, the worlds smallest lady and the boy with lobster claws-have pasts filled with rejection, brutal humiliation, abject loneliness and harrowing cruelty. Under Elsas tent, they have found a home and a community that accepts them just as God made them.  What they don't see, is that Elsa, played by series regular, Jessica Lange doing the best Marlene Dietrich imitation since Madeline Kahn, only wants them around so they can shower her with adoration while she vainly dreams of Hollywood success with her long out of date cabaret act.  As in GLEE, we never doubt Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuks tremendous empathy for underdogs and those forced to live on the fringes of society.

There are a half dozen plot lines going at once, as unusual for AHS, the main one centering around Dot and Bette Tattler, a pair of conjoined twins who come to be with Elsas show after decades of being hidden away from the world by their mother-who was murdered by one of the twins, but which one. Dot and Bette are played by Sarah Paulson in a triumph of special effects, creating two distinct characters sharing a single body. Theres the thug of a strong man and his wife, an exotic dancer with three tits; Jimmy the hot tempered boy with lobster claws who has a thing for Dot and Bette, and Jimmys mother, Ethel, the bearded lady whose days are coming to an end after a hard life.

But more than any other season of AHS, the action on FREAK SHOW was driven by the villains, and in the character of Twisty the Clown, the series outdid itself in creating a painted monster that could go toe to toe with Pennywise from IT when it comes the utter creepiness.  Twisty the homicidal clown, played to perfection by John Carroll Lynch, was a true walking nightmare stalking the freak show and brutally hacking up the unwary guest had the seasons goriest and scariest scenes. But right next to Twisty is Dandy Mott, a spoiled rotten little rich boy in the body of a man; Dandy will stop at nothing, including mass murder, to get what he wants, and has taken a real shine to Dot and Bette, determined to have them no matter what the cost to anyone else.  Dandy is played by Finn Wittrock, whose handsome face masks an incredible inner ugliness.  And then there are Stanley and Maggie, a pair of con artists played by regulars Dennis OHare and Emma Roberts, who plan to kidnap and murder as many freaks as possible and sell their bodies to a museum.

It says something about the weakness of this season when the bad guys so totally overshadow the sympathetic characters and their story lines.  The fact that Elsas deluded ambitions of stardom are the driving force for much of the episodes speaks to this seasons problems, that and the fact the most compelling person on the show had only a four episode arc.  Neal Patrick Harris shows up late in the season, but his Chester the Magician is ultimately revealed to be just another sicko. Tight plotting has never been a strong point for AHS, but I think FREAK SHOW has more loose ends than any previous one: a character is shown living happily ever after even though he was wanted for murder the last we knew; the sexuality of another seems to be fluid to say the least; the final fate on another, after being mutilated by the other freaks, is never shown.  The outrageousness of other seasons, with their willingness to just go there, is largely missing this time around, instead relying on gore and grotesqueness to carry the day.

But there is no faulting the acting by a superb cast, starting with Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett, bitter enemies on last years COVEN, here playing women who become the best of friends. Is Bates's Baltimore accent a nod to John Waters, who had quite a freak show of his own in his independent movies made there?  Evan Peters, who is becoming something of a real movie star after playing Quicksilver in the X-MEN franchise, is back as Jimmy the Lobster Boy, along with Francis Conroy as Dandys wacko mother; they are joined by Mare Winningham, Gabourney Sibide, Jamie Brewer, Danny Huston, and Lily Rabe returning in various parts. Patti LaBelle plays the Mottss long suffering maid and other newcomers are Matt Bomer, Michael Chiklis, Malcolm Jamal-Warner, Grace Gummer, Celia Weston, and Wes Bentley, who makes the most of his screen time as Edward Mordrake.  Naomi Grossman reprises her role as Pepper the Pinhead from ASLYUM, thus connecting the seasons.  And all praise to Erika Ervin, the late Rose Siggins, Matt Fraser and Jyoti Amge, very special people who are most certainly not freaks in real life.

If FREAK SHOW is something of a disappointment, Im still rating it highly; its never dull and always entertaining; like I said, it makes for a great binge watch. And from what Ive heard, the following season, HOTEL, where Lady Gaga steps in for the departing Lange, things get back on track.",1468886400,,6512,4.692982456140351

6759951,3,B00OQUZQZO,"This is the most cynical, mean spirited, nasty show I have ever seen - that often flirts with brilliance. I've got a real love hate relationship with AHS Freak show. On the one hand they're exploiting handicapped people - on the other hand they're employing handicapped people. Mat Fraser gives a great performance and does much more than just look the part. I personally dislike Michael Chiklis now after seeing his character Spoiler.........  suffocate a  baby sized woman.  When you read that this is in the script you turn down the role. The Dandy character is a powerhouse of annoyance. Where this show really shines is with the musical numbers. They take quite a large number of my favorite songs and kick them up a notch. I love how Jessica Lange adds class to Lana Del Rey's debauched Gods and Monsters with a few lyrical changes and a saucy German accent. The 2 parter featuring Wes Bentley as the 2 faced English gentleman Edward Mordrake (apparently a real person) was genuinely brilliant and very spooky - the whole reason I like scary movies in the first place. There are just too many unlikable unsympathetic characters in this show and too few people to route for that survive the first few episodes. Jessica Lange's performance as the ring mistress should be noted. She's doing some of her all time best work, and while that's really cool, her character is anything but - just a petulant senior child - a primadona of the worst kind. But seriously, I'd have given 4 stars if they didn't Spoiler........ kill Ma' Petite, but that crosses an nonredeemable line.",1454803200,,1575,4.761904761904762

6759995,3,B00OQUZQZO,"I loved the first American Horror Story, and have compared all others to the first one - none have come close. This one was, IMO, the worst. Thought at first it would be a good season; characters were unique and what I think of from old fashioned freak shows and the clown - well, eewww. Didn't like 'em before, now I really don't! That's stuff of nightmares.

But the story line...well, wait, there really wasn't one. It's overly and unnecessarily graphic sexual content did nothing for the story and had us fast-forwarding. I'm not a prude, but well, guess you'll just have to watch it to understand. Definitely not something to watch with kiddos around. Around 3/4 way thru they try inserting quippy humor that doesn't work. Yes a surprising end I didn't see coming (then again, as much as I struggled to watch it, maybe I would have if I had focused more).

I give up; won't bother watching future seasons. If you, like I did, feel compelled to watch just because you've watched the other seasons, I suggest borrowing it from a friend (I have a copy that will never be watched again) or pick up used/cheap.",1449532800,4,1110,4.57286432160804

All the characters came across as people we could care about, versus the ridiculous caricatures we saw in season 3. Jessica Lange's character Elsa Mars was particularly intriguing as a Marlene Dietrich wannabe who dreamed of stardom.

The entire cast was great, most notably the women. Jessica Lange in her Dietrich-esque leading role is excellent (as always) and Kathy Bates stole my heart in this one, as the bearded lady. She gives a speech about ""hope"" and it's dangers that is reason enough to buy the boxed set. We'll all identify with that.
There is gore, sexy stuff (""Dandy"" despite being a despicable character, is hopelessly sexy) great acting, very cool music, and most of all, the majority of the cast are 'the real deal' and not really actors.

Disjointed and not believable subplots of greed, and exploitation. Ending was predictable, as was most of the film, and lacked in thoughtful closure. Previous years were much better.

Perhaps the actors, director and producers would like to do something meaningful and donate the money they made off of their gallows humor to improving the lives, education, vocational opportunities of the film's subjects.",1447718400,3,789,5.362903225806452

6760010,4,B00OQUZQZO,"It's another season of blood and gore but AMERICAN HORROR STORY never fails to deliver. FREAK SHOW takes us behind the scenes of a carnival that seems to stay in one place. No wonder they have trouble getting an audience. Our favorite stars are back and this season lovely Jessica Lange is Elsa Mars, the owner of the freak show and mother hen to her outcast troupe.
I loved the previous 3 season of AMERICAN HORROR STORY so I was eager to watch Season 4. It was hard to get beyond the first couple of sad and violent episodes but I stuck with it. Expect to see the most frightening clown you could imagine. Twisty the Clown is the stuff of nightmares.
At times, Season 4 seems confused and directionless and then it gets back on track. Twisty will haunt your dreams and then he is gone and then his back and then gone. The writers seemed not to know how to follow through with Twisty's story.
The problems with FREAK SHOW are the multiple stories and the ""fake"" freaks. This season Sarah Paulson plays Siamese twins--two heads with one set of arms and legs. The visual effects don't often work well and we see one Paulson face at a time or Paulson with a fake head. Evan Peters is Lobster Boy with fake hands, Kathy Bates, with a seriously odd accent, wears a fake beard to be the bearded lady.
The real gems of this season are the life ""freaks"" and let's not call them freaks. They are vibrant people overcoming serious abnormalities. As I watched the show, I wondered how they made Paul the Illustrated Seal look so real with his deformed arms. How did they make Ma Petite look like a living baby doll? Fantastic visual effects to make Legless Susi ""legless."" I researched the characters and found the actors have special conditions that make them ""different"". These fine actors are the stars of the show. Mat Fraser really has deformed arms and Rose Siggins lost her legs up to her hips. And amazingly, Jyoti Amge is a full grown woman just over 2 feet tall.  These actors are amazingly talented and I hope they were return in future seasons.
In the end, the real freaks are murderous Twisty the Clown and pretty rich boy Dandy Mott (Finn Wittrock). Being a freak is not a physical deformity but rather having an evil mind and soul. In the carnival world, the freaks are a family and stay together. There is a strong homage to the 1932 cult classic freaks that actually featured circus freaks getting their revenge.  Don't miss with one of their kind or be prepared to pay the ultimate price. Season 4 doesn't play as much on the supernatural as in the past. Only one other worldly character appears to take the soul of the most evil.
There is an amazing array of actors in this season beyond our regulars. This season's visiting singer turned actress is Patti LaBelle. Pepper the pinhead is back and barely seen until she is featured in a sad and tragic story. They even cross over to the connection to Season 2 AYSLUM. What could be better? Season 4 will keep your interest but the writers have lost their way with the Elsa Mars character. Her story goes all over the place.
Sometimes we hate her and other times she is an object of pity. The season finale is an incredible disappointment as if the writers had to quickly tie up their story and took a page from the TV show LOST.
Although I was disappointed at times in Season 4, I was totally addicted and can't wait for Season 5.",1447372800,8,3387,4.461290322580645

With a cast as they have, and the money that has obviously been poured into its production, this could have been good. Now it's barely watchable.

Fire the writers. Find one good writer. This is a schizophrenic mixture that's not a Freak Show in the least. It's flat out R.I.P. Watching grass grow on a grave would be more entertaining than this...",1446249600,,709,4.664

6760042,4,B00OQUZQZO,"Welcome to another entertaining and ghoulish season of one of the best modern television series. Like the previous seasons of AHS, Freak Show brings its viewers a generous helping of macabre mayhem (with a nice smattering of gore now and then for those who like it; though sometimes the violence and bloodshed seems gratuitous for me personally, as I prefer supernatural horrors), as well as characters and story with a deeply sad core-- which is part of why I keep coming back to AHS: the emotional heart is so strong and touching. There were scenes in this year's tale that actually had me crying, they were so poignant and heart-wrenching. I like that this is not just a good spook-show, but much more.

There are nods here to many film and TV influences, from Tod Browning's ""Freaks"" to ""Psycho"" and many more. And what a splendid array of zany characters. When wealthy widow Gloria Mott and her spoiled adult son Dandy came on the scene, I knew this was going to be fascinating. And this show surprises us often ... throwing in a big guest star 3/4 into the season, or killing off a main character suddenly.

Horror aficionados will find much to enjoy here. The mood is creepy to the hilt. Plus, there are marvelous period details, fun musical numbers (anachronistic as they are), excellent cinematography, and stellar turns from the actors (particularly Kathy Bates, Jessica Lange, and Evan Peters).

Those who don't care for things that go bump in the night ought to steer clear, naturally; but lovers of thrills and monster movies and classic horror will find a treasure trove at this particular side show. Just keep an eye out for that haggard-looking clown with the ghastly mask and a penchant for murder.",1445644800,,1715,4.787162162162162

6760048,4,B00OQUZQZO,"With a premise tailor-made for AHS, Season Fours FREAK SHOW stills brings the thrills and chills but unfortunately an early demise of the seasons creepy killer, an underwhelming finale and some sloppy writing and clichd storylines hold back what could have been perfection.

Set in 1952 Jupiter, Florida in a travelling sideshow, Miss Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) acts as surrogate mother to her little monsters who inhabit Elsas Cabinet of Curiosities, but she also has designs on a show-biz career like Marlene Dietrich and resents anyone stealing her spotlight. This allows for some anachronistic musical numbers to appear as well as songs on the soundtrack such as David Bowies FAME. Hearing these as well as a performance of Nirvana by Evan Peters take the viewer out of the moment. The same thing happens when the writers carelessly slip in some crass hip-hop speak (who was saying Im trying to get a nut back in the 50s when referring to sex???).

The season is somewhat of a homage to Tod Brownings FREAKS with several plot points liberally borrowed from the 1932 horror classic and many real-life human oddities among the cast to give it authenticity. It would not have worked as well without them and all do an admirable job. Most of the repertory players are back with Angela Bassett a standout as the sassy hermaphrodite (sporting an Ethel Mertz hairdo) and her strongman husband (Michael Chiklis) has one of the more interesting arcs this season. Frances Conroy does what she can with her limited role as a rich widow with a deranged, spoiled son (Finn Wittrock) and has the best line of the season when she tries to calm one of his violent rages by offering We can play June Allyson paper dolls. Kudos to the special effects department and Sarah Paulson as they have the difficult task of bringing the Siamese Twins Bette and Dot to screen with a premise much more difficult than the old Patty Duke doubles trick.

The kills are some of the most wonderfully gruesome this show has seen, and juxtaposed with the bright, squeaky-clean image of the 1950s the images are doubly disturbing. There's some flashback footage to 1930s Berlin in which Miss Elsa is filmed performing acts of depravity which is truly unsettling as well as a flash-forward to 1962 that cleverly ties into ASYLUM featuring a cameo by Lily Rabe as Sister Mary Eunice and a chilling performance by Mare Winningham as evil personified.

I should point out that I'm not at all a fan of this cycle's sub-genre and therefore cast harsher judgement than those who are startled by a murderous clown terrifying men, women, and children alike. I also don't see the appeal in horrifying disabled individuals disabilities for entertainment purposes. I, for one, find it demeaning. Despite all things considered, Bates, Paulson, and Roberts turned in plaudible performances. I must also confess that I did not complete viewing the season (cutting the cord at the end of 2014), but I highly doubt the outstanding three installments would have substantially swayed my stance.

I am looking forward to viewing this autumn's outing, 'American Horror Story: Hotel', if only to experience the newfound vibe Lady Gaga will provide in Jessica Lange's unfortunate absence. Fingers crossed for some jolts and awes, harkening back to the beauty of 'Murder House' and 'Asylum'.",1440288000,2,1111,5.1722222222222225

6760065,5,B00OQUZQZO,"AHS is one of the rare examples of a show that gets better with each season and Freak Show is my favorite yet. They were all good in their own ways but I really enjoyed the theme and setting in this one where it takes us to 1952 in Jupiter, Florida at the carnival. Freak Show was such a great season since it's horror can be scary in parts while rather campy and humorous in others, it just works well which most movies or shows try too hard or only go in one direction. We also get to see some of the actors return from the last season which I enjoyed watching again and playing different characters. Kathy Bates, Evan Peters, Emma Roberts, Angela Basset, Denis O'Hare, Sarah Paulson and of course Jessica Lange to name a few; Hotel's going to be hard to get used to with Jessica Lange absent. Finn Witrock makes a good debut in AHS as Dandy which you hate his character but he plays him well and is one of the best on the show. There's some good guest appearances here as well from Neil Patrick Harris to Patti Labelle.

AHS: Freakshow has possibly the best cast yet and the best characters of any season. I can agree with fans that didn't like it since it was a little different from the first 3, maybe it's an acquired taste but I enjoyed it for many reasons..
- 1950s setting and music
- Jessica Lange performing David Bowie's Life On Mars along with Evan Peter's performing Nirvana's Come As You Are and Sarah Paulson on Fiona Apples' Criminal. AHS has some of, if not the best music of any TV show with a bit of everything in different seasons.
- It's take on the freaks and how the normal people are ironically the real freaks.
- The humor; particularly the milkman with the rolling pin in the first episode.
- Classic horror elements from Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) as a major influence to Neil Patrick Harris' character who resembles Michael Redgrave who also played a ventriloquist in one of the first horror anthology films Dead Of Night (1945).
- And again, the cast is top-notch and possibly the best of any season yet.

Freak Show does have it's negatives but more than outweighed by the positives. Too much sex throughout which I'm not the type to be offended by a show and shut it off just because it has sex in it but Freak Show tend to go a little far at times; Ending which wasn't terrible but killing off half the characters is getting old by this point and was a little forced as if they had to find a way to kill them off just for the point of killing them off; Characters performing songs that came out at least 2 decades after 1952 which I agree that it would've been even better if they chose songs from the '40s/'50s era but learned to ignore since it's fictional and doesn't have to be 100% historically accurate.

All of the AHS seasons have been good in their own way and Freak Show is different which I can see where fans are coming from. Maybe it's an acquired taste, however I think it's the best they've done yet and will have a hard time surpassing it.",1431561600,8,2990,4.335714285714285

I loved the small role by Pattie Labelle as Dora ,Dandy and Gloria Mott's (Francis Conroy) housekeeper. There was a lot of blood and gore in most episodes and let's face it, we as horror fans usually love that,I certainly do.

When Jessica Lange sang ""Life On Mars"" emulating (David Bowie) I thought it was genius. Really, all the musical numbers were great and each week was fabulous and it felt like the hour and few minutes just flew by, so I can't wait to buy the blu ray.

At first I was very disappointed with this season; not meaning I didn't enjoy it but Freak Show and Coven just had the vast opportunities to make it a masterpiece, like Asylum, which some agree, others don't and that's cool cause I can agree to disagree.

Coven and Freak Show both had amazing pilots. Bitchcraft was near perfect and Monsters Among Us was insightful and a very dramatic portrayal of these carnival 'freaks', I felt sympathy for the characters.

Sarah Paulson leaps off the screen with a double performance of two different characters. Knowing she had to dedicate so much to that role is unbelievable. Filming 12 hours a day for each episode, which is usually around 8 days for an hour long show. Dot or Dorothy is what you could try to say is the 'evil' twin, is a lonely, cynical a little bitter but has a heart. Bette seems to be hogging up all the endorphins because she usually is smiling. She is much more naive than Dot, almost on an older sister looking out for her younger one.

New on the roster is Michael Chiklis as Dell, Ethel's (Kathy Bates) ex husband and Jimmy's (Evan Peters) father and Finn Wittrock who stars as Dandy Mott, Gloria Mott's (Frances Conroy) spoiled, childish, psychotic son. Dandy and Stanley (Denis O'Hare) pose as the central villains of this season. Last but not least is Desiree Dupree (Angela Bassett), a hermaphrodite with three breasts.

Returning is Jessica Lange who truly shines and is one of the few actresses that could pull of the character of Elsa Mars without just making her a boring Roxie Hart type (pre-trial). Elsa is an eccentric, emotional and secretly hiding her tragic past which was very traumatic. Elsa is best described as a woman who saw what Marlene Dietrich did and was trying out and didn't find the same success. A star in her own eyes, but trying to forget that in reality she is just the headliner for a dying freak show in Florida.

Ethel (Kathy Bates) is the former drunk; and who could blame her (?) is the bearded lady. It's established that she's Elsa's (Jessica Lange) best friend and her right hang woman and sees the good in her; Elsa had the empathy to recruit all of these rejected and discriminated people and give them a living and a little piece of ""glamor"". This is for her mostly to have as a propulsion to be the star of the show.

At first we have an unforgettable villain played by John Caroll Lynch, Twisty the Clown. This psychotic, deluded serial killer will do anything to please childrenand I'll just leave it to that. Enjoy Twisty while he's around!

For a while there was that missing element of Horror that Coven started to lack. Unfortunately the plot which was rigged for a great ride got on and off the tracks. For the most part, this season is highly predictable.

There are many special guest stars that come and go, however none of them except for Dora (Patti Labelle) who is Gloria's (Frances Conroy) maid. She does her duties but does not tolerate blundering numbskullery which sadly is her demise. Nevertheless another strong character with great scenes.

It's not what I would recommend to a new viewer of the show. It really lacks the strength and focus to have a consistent narrative that usually only fans will forgivingly look past. I would say this is the weakest season of the American Horror Story franchise but it's still not half bad.

Rated TV-MA LSV

Contains strong pervasive graphic violence, strong sexual content with disturbing images, drug use and some coarse language. Recommended for 17+",1426204800,4,4124,4.765778401122019
