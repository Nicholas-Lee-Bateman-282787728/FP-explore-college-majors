8755173,1,B01D8R14QU,"First, this series should have been called The Dumbbells. It is absolutely disgusting, I just have no words to describe it. Mother is particularly bad  too loud and hysterical, a very unpleasant voice, terrible gestures and facial expressions. She is too young as well. The boy who plays Gerry is simply ugly and repulsive with his sickening smirk. Also, he speaks very fast, and is a terrible actor altogether. Leslie (Ill put all their names in quotes) is absolutely characterless and has zero personality. Margo is pretty, but her wooden face fails to express any emotions. Larry doesnt look like the real Larry at all. Spiro is too young (and too sexy), and when he looked at Mother on the road during their first meeting, I thought he would screw her right away. Disgusting. The creators of this show must have confused Spiro for Captain Creech, the old libertine. Everything is bad. How can Lee Durrell (or anyone else) possibly like this travesty?!

The first three episodes were awful. I repeat: AWFUL. The show looks like a bad parody of some kind. Nothing has remained of the original trilogy. All stories are completely different, a product of the sick imagination of the scriptwriters. How can they possibly claim that this series is based on the original books?! Its definitely not. The names of characters and the place and time of action are the same, and thats all. The story in itself is bad as well. We see no animals, no sun, no warmth, no idyll. Half of the time is spent in a gloomy house, which eventually collapses. Everyone is shouting loudly and hysterically at each other. Everyone but little Gerry with his idiotic smile  he seems to be mentally retarded or something. This show is a grave insult to Gerald Durrells memory and legacy. Its creators should be ashamed of it. Hopefully, something happens and they never get it to show any further episodes. This abomination must be cancelled immediately!

What is particularly disconcerting about this nightmare is that its creators did not bother to check some elementary facts about the Durrell family. Thus, in the series, Mother claims that she gave birth to her first child 21 years ago, which is wrong: it actually happened 23 years ago. Also, the description of the series says that Larry was 21 years old, and Gerry was 11. In reality, Larry (the first child) was 23 in 1935, and Gerry was 10. Gerrys and Larrys ages are even mentioned at the very beginning of My Family and Other Animals. How could the scriptwriters have failed to notice that? They obviously never read the original trilogy. The ages of Margo and Leslie as given in the description are wrong as well.

As I have already mentioned, the actress who plays the mother is way too young. Louisa Durrell was 49 in 1935, while Keeley Hawes was 10 (!) years younger when they filmed it, and she looks even younger due to heavy makeup and plastic surgery. She could pass for Louisas daughter. In Gerald Durrells books, his mother looks and acts completely different. Hawes is totally unfit for this role. She always shouts, gesticulates and weeps, and sometimes even goes into fits of hysterics. On several occasions, I was afraid she would kill herself or one of her children. Hawes is probably not a bad actress (but not great either), and she would look fine in the role of, say, Anna Karenina, a hysterical and mentally unbalanced woman who eventually jumped under a train. But the role of gentle and wonderful Mrs. Louisa Durrell is certainly not for her. She should be ashamed of her pitiful and disastrous performance.

Generally, the original books are about little Gerry, and all events are shown through his eyes. This series, however, is focused on the mother, and is basically a story of her (love) life. Gerry is barely shown, and when it happens, he just quickly says his lines, as if he were in a hurry, and then disappears again for half of the episode. Also, as I have already said, all stories are made up and do not appear in Gerald Durrells books. The plot is completely different (Did Larry really have a burst appendicitis in the books?). This series is NOT based on the Corfu trilogy.

I think Ill just watch again the wonderful 1987 series with Hannah Gordon and Brian Blessed. A brilliant production, always a pleasure to watch. (The 2005 film, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment.)

My advice to everyone is: Read the original trilogy, watch the 1987 series, and ignore this garbage.

0 out of 5 stars (1 is too much for this abomination).",1474070400,4,4515,4.726810673443456
8755174,5,B01D8R14QU,"Very interesting series of a widowed mother of four leaving England and settling in Corfu just before the outbreak of WWII.  They are an unconventional family, each member with a very distinct personality.  It was interesting to see how this family adapted to such an unfamiliar environment and culture and how they grew as individuals.  As with most British drama series, it was a well-written, well-acted, enjoyable series.  With hints of war looming, it will be interesting to see what happens in the next series.  I hope that it will be available in the US format or will be shown on PBS at some point.  It's well worth watching.",1468886400,,633,4.761467889908257
