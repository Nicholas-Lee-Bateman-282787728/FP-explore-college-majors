8469206,4,B005EXA8E6,"I watched this series online with fansubs awhile ago and decided to show my support and pay for the real deal. I am a little sad there is not a dubbed version only for the fact I can't put this on in the background while doing other things because I need to be able to read the subtitles to know what is happening. Japanese language is much better in most anime than the Englsih dub, but it requires undivided attention.",1370044800,3,420,4.2625
8469207,5,B005EXA8E6,I purchased this in February. It's perfect. It has all 26 episodes with English subtitles. It's a cute and funny series. Great gift!!,1363305600,5,133,4.826086956521739
