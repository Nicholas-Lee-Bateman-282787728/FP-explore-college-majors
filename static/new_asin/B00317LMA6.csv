4048388,3,B00317LMA6,"Neither Up from the Depths nor Demon of Paradise are great but they were amusing (and progenitors of the Sy Fy Channel's usual fare of today); I wasn't looking for awesome so I wasn't disappointed. Up from the Depths must have been made before Piranha since it lacks the Corman touch for exploitation, and Demon of Paradise altogether missed the exploitative boat that Humanoids from the Deep virtually created. Not the best from Corman's vaults but fun to wile away the hours.",1350777600,,477,4.829268292682927

4048390,3,B00317LMA6,"Oh well not everything New World Pictures was involved with was good. Case in point Up From The Depths and Demon of Paradise. Packaged together by the fine folks at Shout Factory we get 2 resort based monster movies in one package. First we have 1979's Up From the Depths and then we have 1987's Demon of Paradise. On a scale of 1-5 with 1 being the pits and 5 very good I'd rate Depths a 1 and Demon a 3 which is being kind. Both films were shot on the cheap( of course) in the Philippine's which was filing in for Hawaii. Up From the Depth's has a giant prehistoric fish that somehow is around a resort in Hawaii run by Sam Bottoms. The story written by Philippine B movie legend Cirio Santiago is dumber than dumb. The monster looks really bad almost Plan 9 level bad. The acting all around is awful and campy beyond belief. The leading lady Susanne Reed is pretty enough but an awful actress who doesn't do any nudity to distract you from that fact either. In fact if supporting actress Denise Hayes didn't pop her top for a sexy photo shoot this movie wasn't anywhere near it's R rating. In some ways there's a link between this film and Alexander Aja's remake of New Worlds Piranha .Piranha takes place in a resort and features a fish species thought dead that isn't that enjoys snacking on humans. Reeds resort activities director could be Elisabeth Shue's predecessor .Denise Hayes was a busty brunette from the U.K and in Piranha Kelly Brook is the same. Of course Aja had 9 times the budget,a better cast and better story to work with. As for Demon of Paradise we have the resurfaced demon Kartha looking to wreck havoc on another Hawaiian resort. This time the resort is run by a woman (Laura Banks) and patrolled by the local sheriff (William Steis) and harbors a research scientist (Kathryn Witt) looking into the legend of Kartha. Compared to Depths this crew actually is decent not Meryl Streep or Al Pacino by any means but competent. Steis has that rugged Alan Vint look and a serious attitude .Witt is an okay looking actress. She's akin to the scientist played by Ann Turkel in Humanoids from the Deep. The required nudity this time comes from Leslie Scarborough playing a pin up model who likes her nose candy. The man in the monster suit looks like a cousin of one of the humanoids and proves to be as hard to kill as Steven Segall. The story is silly but if you play along it's campy fun. The last 20 minutes save this film as it picks up the action level quite nicely. If you appreciate low budget films you can stomach this 2 disc set .A side note Demon of Paradise is remake of 1957's Naked Paradise an earlier Roger Corman production. Needless to say the gore,nudity and foul language are amped up versus 1957 standards.",1320192000,2,2746,4.461232604373757
4048391,4,B00317LMA6,"These two films are so incredibly bad that you can't help but laugh at them. I first watched Up From the Depths after renting it, out of sheer boredom, in college. Little did I know I would find a true gem of a bad movie. The acting is terrible, the special effects are laughable and the overall storyline is rip off of Jaws. Even with so many strikes against it, I still find myself entertained. This is the type of movie you watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon when there's nothing on tv and you want a good chuckle. These films aren't for everyone, and I won't pretend they're of any decent quality, but I like them!",1317254400,,616,4.273504273504273
4048392,5,B00317LMA6,"Let's be honest here:  both of these movies are crap, although Up From The Depths looks like Academy Award material compared to Demon Of Paradise.  On the other hand, I love this stuff.  These two pair up very nicely for a rainy Saturday afternoon.  So get the corn popping and put your feet up.  If you like this stuff, you'll love this pairing.",1301961600,4,346,4.428571428571429
4048393,4,B00317LMA6,"Okay not the best but fairly decent.
Up from the Depths- I liked the concept which is actually still used today: an earthquake releases a man-eating creature or creatures up from the depths (ex. Piranha 3D). The cast and dialogue was okay but the creature was probably on screen for only 1 minute total and when it was on screen it was only for a quick moment. The creature design and size changes throughout the film so it looks as if there are several creatures as oposed to one giant creature as described on the back cover. 3 stars.
Demon of Paradise- At first I disliked this film but as I watched it more and more I started liking it. Cheese, fun, and an obviously fake-looking monster: a cross between the Predator, a dog, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. I actually liked the music which was electronic mixed with suspense. 4 stars.
Special features include trailers for Firecracker, Humanoids from the Deep, Caged Heat (my favorite trailer), Jackson County Jail, Demon of Paradise, and Up from the Depths and a short Making of... Up from the Depths. Overall 4 stars.",1301011200,3,1082,4.640625

Talk about home movie horrors, I've had more thrills from watching Sigmund & The Sea Monsters than with these two lame ducks.
They look like they were left over bits from other films that they just got some people off the street and made another two films from it.
Don't believe me?
Buy it then, you'll see and cringe and gasp in disbelief that films like this exist.
Great cover though, just a pity about the so called movies.",1299283200,,569,4.377358490566038
4048395,3,B00317LMA6,"Everyone who loves roger corman will love this terrible creature double feature! Shout has been throwing a lot of his out recently and its a good thing too! I suggest mountain dew and wings for this party. This is what makes america great! Up from the depths and demon of paradise are by no means hollywood material but, they are not supposed to be are they? Remember, in case you do not already know, Roger Corman is the king of low budget crap! But, I actually have seen worse. Some were made in the early 2000s!",1297728000,,514,4.364583333333333
4048396,3,B00317LMA6,"This disc is kind of a letdown considering both films deal with creatures from the deep(a personal favorite theme of mine), and are from the Corman factory.
Well, Up From the Depths isn't a total loss, it does have some redeeming qualities.  In the film, a mutant monster shark is on a rampage at a Hawaiian resort.  Naturally the schmuck resort manager wants to keep a lid on the disappearances, but when the creature becomes common knowledge, the manager offers a bounty to whoever can kill the beast. Soon, all the guests and tourists arm themselves and go monster hunting, but in the end it's up to Sam Bottoms and his sideburns to save the day.
The movie wisely doesn't take itself seriously.  In fact, it's downright comedy with it's zany characters running rampant around the island.  The final act almost seems like Jaws meets The Cannonball Run with the goofy guests competing for the bounty of the shark.  The shark itself is shown in brief bits, and in the vibe of the rest of the film, is quite silly looking.  It's definitely the highlight of the disc.
Now I had seen Demon of Paradise when I was a teenager, and I didn't care much for it.  Giving it a second chance I found that I still don't like it.  Also taking place in Hawaii, a prehistoric, bulletproof lizardman is awakened to terrorize the island.  The monster suit is quite ridiculous, and looks nothing like the creature depicted on the box cover.  Unfortunately this film plays it much more seriously than it should, which would be fine if the story had been handled better.  Unfortunately, there isn't a single interesting character in the film, and the whole thing is just terribly uninteresting and boring.  Throw in some coke dealers, a fashion model, and a resort owner exploiting the monster for financial gain, and you still get a film that's terribly uninteresting and boring.  You'd think with a silly monster, the best bet would have been to play it out more tongue in cheek.  Lots of yakety-yak and not much monster action til the final minutes really hurts it.  Plus gore is minimal.  At least they could have upped the gore to give it some redeeming quality.  Oh, well.
DVD extras are zip, but how much do you really want to know about either of these anyway?  It may seem as though the Corman Classics series is now scraping the bottom of the barrel, but there are definitely more good ones to see the light of day.  So don't get discouraged!",1297468800,5,2431,4.611627906976744
4048397,4,B00317LMA6,"Shout Factory has gotten the rights to release Roger Corman *classics* and to my pleasant surprise we are getting a couple of rarities that have never been on DVD. Those movies are Demon of Paradise & Up from the Depths, scheduled for early 2011.
Both of these films are presented in anamorphic widescreen and they are very beautiful prints..very clear, very clean..sharp. They never have or will look better. These films were produced/backed by Roger Corman. They are both USA/Philippine co-productions. Both films are supposed to have been shot in Hawaii & haven't found much evidence, besides links and the films itself saying they were shot there..
Both are in color & contain some gore but nothing revolting or graphic.
DEMON OF PARADISE was directed by Cirio H. Santiago & is basically a Creature from the Black Lagoon ripoff killing tourists in the Hawaiian ISland. The monster is basically a man sized amphibious monster. It's on odd looking monster. There is some good scenes with the monster & a decent story to keep things moving along.
UP FROM THE DEPTHS is directed by Charles Griffith (who did a lot of movies with Corman) and is a Jaws ripoff with a giant shark munching on Hawaiians. This is not to be confused with Monster Shark aka Devil Fish about a shark octopus which was an MST3K experiment.
Both films are of the grade B (or Z for that matter) category but there are those that enjoy a campy good monster movie, such as me for example. Depending on your tastes you might think these are utterly awful or really get a kick out of watching these.
For those that are into these movies, you are in for a treat. With Shout Factory releasing this, Piranha, Humanoids from the Deep & Kingdom of the Spiders, I think there is hope for other obscure titles out there. Since they have gone into the Corman New World library we have gotten Galaxy of Terror, Forbidden World , Deathstalker, Battle Beyond the Stars, Warlords of the 21st Century for the first time on DVD. For classic Corman fans we will get a DVD release of Attack of the Crab Monsters / Not of this Earth / War of the Satellites in 2011.
Getting back to this DVD - in closing, I can say having Up from the Depths and Demon of Paradise on a double feature DVD with what I expect to have royal treatment from Shout Factory I have given it 4 stars - the entire product basically. The movies aren't great but the DVD will be, even if the transfers are really well done.
I hope to see more obscure or cult horror / independent studios' monster movies down the road..",1261612800,32,2540,4.548034934497816
8386707,3,B00317LMA6,"This great double DVD has two very similar movies on it. Both are turkeys, but at the same time, they are pretty entertaining.

""Up From The Depths"" belongs at the bottom of any discerning movie-buff's list of ""Jaws"" relatives, it is truly dire. The plot summary needs no more than one line - a giant monster fish terrorises staff and holidaymakers at a Hawaiian beach resort.

The movie is actually not too badly filmed and a lot of the action takes place on boats and in open water. I say ""action"", although in fact there isn't really very much. The giant fish attacks are portrayed on screen by means of very fast cutting, and lots of extreme close ups of thrashing, bubbles and red tinted water, so in other words, NOTHING. The fish, when it does make it's fleeting appearances is pretty plastic and immobile looking, although there are almost no clear shots of it anywhere in the entire movie.

What can't be ignored, though, is the unbelievable audio soundtrack. According to another reviewer's comments about the movie on IMDb, this was all added in post- production because the original live recorded soundtrack was lost. This makes for some pretty jaw-dropping viewing, and if you come in expecting to watch the film for laughs. you might even find it hilarious. Towards the end, when a full scale hunt gets underway for the fish, the movie begins to resemble the comedy movie ""Airplane!"" as all the cast speak the most ridiculous dialogue in rapid fire comedy turns. It makes it look like the film was originally intended to be a comedy...maybe it was? If it wasn't, then the vocal dubbing well and truly destroys it. Maybe the post-dub recording cast didn't give a damn and just decided to enjoy themselves. It's probably the best thing about the movie.

Sadly, the visual disappointment of the fishy menace itself, and the lack of any real special effects in general, mean that ""Up From The Depths"" is devoid of any tension or drama. But bad movie fans might find it to be worth a look.

And then we have ""Demon of Paradise"", which is a less light-hearted affair, but it follows almost the exact same plot. Tourists menaced at a Hawaiian resort. Resort owner tries to save business by promoting the monster as an ""attraction"". Criminals are operating around the resort and meet an ugly end. Male and female leads head up the hunt to find monster. A photographer and sexy model attacked while taking sexy glamour shots on the open water...Wow, that's a lot of similarities!

At least in this movie we do get a lot of good looks at the monster. Rather than a fish, this is a guy in a ""Creature From the Black Lagoon""-style costume, except with a Godzilla tail, a toothy snout like a dog, and a frilly hair-do. In case I haven't made it clear, he's not scary. A lot of shots show him surfacing in the water, which seem to be achieved by filming the actor in waist deep water, from which he pops his head up and down like Whack-A-Mole. Later on, the monster goes on a full-on land based rampage which at least mixes things up a bit. The effects aren't very good, although there is a lot of nice location shooting, but sadly in a lot of shots the sky is very overcast and cloudy, which makes for some very grey looking landscapes...shame really.

The DVD comes with a few Grindhouse trailers, and unfortunately one is for ""Humanoids From The Deep"", which is a lot better than both of these movies! However it's a good DVD release and a fun double act to enjoy with some friends and some beers.",1454803200,,3500,4.5814696485623

8386713,3,B00317LMA6,"I am a fan of B Horror movies, always was and always will be but there is a difference between a really fun B Horror movie and a boring B Horror movie, sadly Up from the Depths and Demon of Paradise are more towards boring than fun. Roger Corman is capable of fun B movies(Terror Within, Forbidden World, Carnosaur 2 & 3, etc.) but when he tried his underwater cash-ins there were some duds. The duds are these two right here while Humanoids from the Deep(1980) and Piranha(1978) are fun movies these two are just simply not.

Up from the Depths is pretty much the Jaws rip-off here and received the more negative reviews than Demon of Paradise and I can honestly say, I enjoyed Demon of Paradise a bit more. Both provide the B movie standards: T&A(Really the only redeeming parts about both of these movies), Gore(Not so much in both cases), and creatures(Rarely seen in UFTD but seen more in DOP). UFTD gets a 1.5/5 and that is being generous and DOP gets a 2/5 being the better of the two.

The DVD is wonderful, you can view both films in a Double Feature style or watch them separate. Both films are presented in Anamorphic Widescreen and is the best quality you will ever see these movies. Bottom Line: If you collect Corman movies like I do pick this up and if you are looking for fun B Horror movies, avoid this pack.",1405641600,,1325,4.404081632653061
8386714,4,B00317LMA6,"BOTTOM LINE:  These two cheesefests are silly fun and enjoyable enough time-wasters IF you love old school monster action with a tiny bit of boobs & blood. I give this double feature of UP FROM THE DEPTHS & DEMON OF PARADISE a full 4 STARS. (Now, if someone would just get around to releasing equally abysmal bigfoot/giant ratman redneck monster flick ""TERROR IN THE SWAMPS"" on either DVD or Blu-ray. Hello? Shout! Factory?!?)

THE STORIES (contains spoilers)...

UP FROM THE DEPTHS: Another cheese-filled rip off of JAWS. This fish monster is supposed to be a prehistoric something or other but looks more like an big inflatable pool toy that was hit with a blowtorch. The few times you actually catch a decent glimpse of the thing it's usually just a few frames or it's obscured or blurry. This was a probably wise choice on the part of the producers since the thing looks so damn crappy. Still, for monster fans, not getting to actually see the creature you paid to see always feels like a cheat, regardless of how ratty the monster actually looks. The film's heroes are typical clueless Z-film dimwits and the whole story is basically one big, convoluted headache. (And it's boring most of the time, too.) On the plus side, the topless model in the movie does have some impressive er, um... assets ...but we only really get a couple of peeks of them; hardly enough to justify having to endure 90 minutes' worth of this cinematic equivalent of a canker sore.

DEMON OF PARADISE: Philippino-lensed film is a fishy mixture of Jaws & Creature from the Black Lagoon. The ""plot"" concerns a whiny businesswoman trying to get her newly-opened resort in Hawaii on its feet. At every turn she finds her efforts sabotaged by the appearance of a murderous prehistoric ""Triphibian""  fish-man. The beast has a bone to chew with a couple of local idiots who unwittingly pick the inlets & tributaries near its underwater lair in which to conduct their drug trafficking. A cowboy cop joins forces with a curvy female scientist to combat the scaly menace. A burnout hippy-type reporter is also on hand in a very UNfunny, annoying comedy relief role. The ""actor"" (Fred Bailey) is also responsible for the film's script. One look at this dork and you'll understand why the movie didn't win any Oscars. LOL. However the guy continued to work for Roger Corman for several years, cranking out scripts for several other Corman quickies, including the amusing Road Warrior clones EQUALIZER 2000 and WHEELS OF FIRE, among others.

THOUGHTS: The plot & script of UP FROM THE DEPTHS are a mess and there simply isn't enough screen time for the monster, so it rates only 2 STARS from me. I'm a fan of DEMON OF PARADISE simply because I have a soft spot for movies that feature beasties like those in Black Lagoon & Piedras Blancas and all the fun men-in-suit monsters from Japan. Your pleasure will depend on how much you love this kind of stuff... or how high your Z-movie pain tolerance level is. ;-)

THE DVD: These two films are on a single-sided disc. Picture & sound are nothing to rave about but look pretty decent. (Better than they did on VHS at least.) Some artifacting & pixelation are present during underwater and nighttime scenes but they're not a show-stopper. Soundmix is level and mostly clear on both films. Bonus extras are limited to TV ads for UP FROM THE DEPTHS and the theatrical (or possibly just home video release) trailers for both films.",1387584000,2,3440,4.732888146911519
