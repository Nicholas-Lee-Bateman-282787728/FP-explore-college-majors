It only lasted for 28 minutes by, the time the introduction was done it was almost over. Not enough information was involved especially if you are a new Christian and want to get more understanding of the Bible.",1265932800,3,311,4.2
2235900,4,B0007R9OD0,"Because of his desire to make his people known, God blessed the kingdom of Solomon above all others throughout the history of the world. At the center of Solomon's kingdom was the temple, which symbolized God's presence among His people and his unique blessing through the nation of Israel. The video Solomon's Temple captures the beauty and grandeur of the temple in a uniquely computer-generated format. It will help to understand the history of Israel as well as shed light on current events in Jerusalem today.

With its impressive computer-generated graphics, Solomon's Temple is transports you to the ancient temple that was promised to David and fulfilled in Solomon. This holy center of worship will come alive in Vision Video's 30-minute, full-color show. You'll walk through its colossal construction, even though the actual building was destroyed in 586 B.C. The graphics are so real that many scenes look more like the work of a camera than a computer. Much of the half-hour is a flashback, as an aged Solomon tells his son, Rehoboam, about the Temple's building even as one feels that a good narrator with a clear crisp voice would have been an ideal choice. You'll rejoice there with the trumpeters and singers, your heart overflowing when the Presence of the Lord fills His holy site. You'll see the altar, the basin, the walls, the utensils, and more as Solomon's ragged voice shares his love of God and the wisdom for which the king was so famous. Excellent for upper elementary students and above, the video would make a fine addition to studies of Judaism, the roots of Christianity, Bible, ancient architecture, and the kings of Israel.

I also highly recommend you to watch the other two DVDs in the Temple series namely, 'The Tabernacle' and 'Herod's Temple: The Temple Jesus Knew', both available on Amazon.",1214611200,,1830,4.957654723127036
2235901,1,B0007R9OD0,"This DVD was a big letdown.  I already knew it was short at 28 minutes when I ordered it, but the first 5 minutes are wasted with credits and some bad music.  This is a CGI feature and the animation is stiff and low quality.  Much of it is simply a series of still images. The narration is given by the aged character Solomon and it is tedious to listen to because he sounds like he is weak and about to die at any second. Worst of all the DVD says practically nothing about the construction of the temple, the purpose of its articles or the related rituals and practices. So you don't really learn much about the temple from it.  I was hoping to use this DVD as a ""history channel"" style learning aid for our church as we studied the construction of the temple but it is not suitable for that purpose. In fact I would be embarrassed to show this to anyone. Don't waste your money.",1113177600,45,881,4.195266272189349

8050865,1,B0007R9OD0,"Waste of money.  Between the stilted narration and low-quality graphics, comes across more as a high school student's project for a computer graphics class than a presentation with any serious scholarship done on the Temple.",1456358400,,224,5.4

8050867,2,B0007R9OD0,The video does have some good information but it's menu does not work correctly.  There is no way to skip ahead through the video and you have to listen to this weird song play out before the real content starts.,1419897600,,212,4.3

the product is highly over rated.  It would have to improve
to be bad.  Save your money.",1309132800,5,154,4.428571428571429
8050871,1,B0007R9OD0,"My husband watched it once and threw it in the trash.  He was going to use it for his church group but considering for the amount of actual information it, it wouldn't have been worth the time it took for the group to watch it. There is much better stuff on Solomon's temple out there.  On the plus,the photography and music is nice.",1291075200,4,333,4.26984126984127
