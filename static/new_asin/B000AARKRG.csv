2384178,5,B000AARKRG,"There are plenty of good reviews about this film, and I'm glad and a little surprised people are as receptive to it's hellish beauty...I'd mainly like to comment on the HQ Amazon Instant Video sourced from Sinister Cinema: the audio is surprisingly clear and brighter than the Eclectic DVD I owned previously. The video almost seems a bit too bright, almost washed out even though it's a B&W film. For $8, it's a no-brainer, and you'll hear every word!",1424044800,2,452,4.734177215189874

2384180,4,B000AARKRG,"A unique and underrated mood piece about a womanizing historian who is called to the old and large gothic home of an old woman to do some work on her late husband's journals. While there he falls for the woman's beautiful daughter Aura (Rosanna Schiaffino). The man realizes that something is wrong and becomes obsessed with the girl.

Everything about this film is top notch. The black & white photography, the use of the many gothic pieces, and the deliberate slow pacing used to create various kinds of tensions... mysterious, sexual and dramatic.",1386633600,2,550,4.913978494623656
2384181,4,B000AARKRG,"It was very smart and an interesting try by Video Dimensions to release a DVD edition of Damiano Damiani's 1966 ""The Witch In Love"" (also released in another edition by Eclectic as ""The Witch"" and including an edition by Sinister Cinema).  Video Dimensions has kept to the original source but as was the complaints by reviewers of the cheaper priced ""The Witch"" the audio was remarked as ""terrible.""  The transfer of the film here looks good even widescreen, but there is a murkiness to the sound that one has to pay close attention to catch what the actors are saying one first viewing.  After not having to concentrate so hard on learning the story, the dialogue on repeated viewing can be heard easier.  And the film has a lot to say and says it well as you come to believe in other realities and the story layers this with a sexual subtext and you are quite pleasantly surprised by the director's artistic vision, what brought me to the this film in the first place.  With this film, Damiani tackles the occult after prior filming Alberto Moravia's novel, ""The Empty Canvas"" which to me was breathtaking.  The critics had misunderstood again and labeled the film boring.  After people got over seeing Bette Davis in a blonde wig, they did not realize Bette was giving one of her finest performance's as Horst Buchholz's mother, who in the book was blonde and Catherine Spaak gave the performance of her career.  I also looked at an earlier Damiani film, 1960's ""Lipstick"" and was bowled over by that as well.  Much later he was responsible for directing ""Amityville 2: The Possession.""  Damiani and Ugo Liberatore wrote the script for ""The Witch in Love"" which is based on the novel by Carlos Fuentes and stars Richard Johnson, Rosanna Schiaffino and Gian Maria Volonte in major roles.  Damiani and Volonte would work together again that same year in ""A Bullet for the General"" an unusual spaghetti western that asks a lot of major questions.  I think Video Dimensions was on the right track here, but I was somewhat disappointed with the sound.  Video Dimensions did provide an extra, trailers of some Bava and Fulci films and other European horror, but some of the titles listed on what is called ""Screams, Italian Style"" on the packaging do not appear included.  Would have loved to see the trailer for ""A Black Veil for Lisa"" and ""Danger Diabolik."" DVD-R.",1376697600,6,2363,4.745721271393643

2384183,5,B000AARKRG,"I was just blown away by THE WITCH (LA STREGA IN AMORE / THE WITCH IN LOVE) 1966.

It is a pretty so-so Sinema Diable DVD, but the quality of the film transcended the bad sound and fullscreen presentation of what was obviously a scope film.

Richard (The Haunting) Johnson plays a committed Lothario, who gets his comeuppance when he takes a position organizing the erotic memoirs of  an aging countess and her beautiful ""daughter"". Countess Dracula clearly borrowed a theme here and there but never managed the level of sophistication that The Witch has to offer, or it's genuinely sensual (though not explicit) eroticism.

I would rank it with the best of Bava, maybe even a dash higher in that it maintains an equally wonderful visual style, but also managed a rather richly layered premise, and some pretty great performances. I'm always thrilled to find a great Euro-horror that is every bit as accomplished as Black Sunday, Eyes Without A Face, I Vampiri, or Castle of Blood.

This film was new to me. I would also love to see a better edition, does any exist? Either way its a must for the fan of great Euro-gothic horror.",1145750400,20,1129,4.681818181818182
2384184,4,B000AARKRG,"If Michelangelo Antonioni directed an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", it would probably look something like this. The witch in question is an old crone who with a sip of a potion, turns into a Sophia Loren clone (well, Sophia without the heat).  Richard Johnson plays the handsome, proverbial fly who becomes her amorous prey when he finds himself a permanent resident in her lair.  While the plot is mere contrivance - and an old one at that - there is enough sultry, surreal, sophisticated-sixties, Italiano caf society atmosphere to keep one's interest.  The B&W photography creates a palpable claustrophobic feel, and although the soundtrack is dubbed, the actors at times can speak volumes with their eyes.  The film should have been released with its original title: ""La Strega in Amore"" [Witch in Love].  This cover and title may lead some folks to assume that this is a Halloween movie.  It isn't.  It's fun viewing though if you enjoy steamy, surreal European movies from the sixties.",1128988800,12,993,4.945783132530121

8077531,2,B000AARKRG,"Though masochism irritates me no end, I enjoyed Damiano Damiani's `The Empty Canvas."" At least it had Catherine Spaak's saucy performance and Bette Davis playing, well, Bette Davis.

The same director is responsible for ""The Witch In Love."" A dreary outing with another masochistic leading character played by Richard Johnson (put to better use in `The Haunting').

The plot is the old chestnut about a naive leading man lured by a femme-fatale-witch-nymphomaniac-name-your-choice of dangerous dame into a web (mansion-country estate-haunted castle-ritzy-villa, or as in this case, a Roman palazzo) with promises of a good time, but obviously, a more sinister turn of events is at hand.

Well, Johnson looks too mature and smart to fall for these kinds of shenanigans, even if perpetrated by Rossana Schiafino (a cross between Mangano and Loren with none of the magic). The plot would be OK for a half hour episode in a European anthology film of the era, but at one hour and forty-five minutes this is heavy going, particularly if you figure out early on where this repetitive and drawn out bore is headed. Every single scene is about three times too long. I confess to fast-forwarding a lot.

The print offered here is decent enough (it probably did not look any better in its original release). Though presented in a Wide Screen format, it is only Letterboxed, and  not Anamorphic. So for those with a flat panel, you will have to ""zoom in"" the image in order to cover the entire screen. It does blows up with not much loss in sharpness. As far as the sound goes, you will have to crank it up or employ headphones if you want understand what's being said. Recommended only for lovers of Eurodreck. Two stars for the palazzo setting and the Italian locales, however",1424304000,2,1767,4.857142857142857
