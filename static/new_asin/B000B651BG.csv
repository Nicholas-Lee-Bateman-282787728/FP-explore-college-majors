2402315,5,B000B651BG,"When I was a kid it always used to bother me that the Creature from the Black Lagoon was listed among the Classic Universal Monsters, but never encountered any of the others. My favorite Universals were always the ""monster rallies"", such as ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" and I've had a terrible hunger for more such films, but sadly there just weren't any more to be had.

As an adult, I've always wanted to see ""Retro-Horror"" films, films in the style of the Classics I loved.

""Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove"" is a Monster Rally in the grand old sense. FINALLY I get to see a ""Creature"" interacting with another classic monster. This is as close to ""Frankenstein vs the Creature from the Black Lagoon"" as we will ever get to see. It's not just a fun film, it is the realization of a dream I've had since I was a kid. And it is proof that ""Retro-Horror"" CAN be done and that there is a market for it.

FvtCfBC features not just the two lead monsters, but also has a Werewolf, a Bride of Frankenstein, the ghost of Dr. Frankenstein and more--all in designs that are spectacular, given the limitations of the film's budget! ""Frankenstein vs the Creature from Blood Cove"" may not please some of the stuffier fans of the classics that inspired it, but nevertheless it is a great fun romp of a movie, made with a profound love of those classics and with a wee bit of spice for the modern audience. In that regard, it has a lot in common with the AIP b&w classics of the '60's. It's sort of Frankenstein meets the Creature on Del Tenney's beach. Sort of.

Destined to be a Cult Classic!",1173312000,3,1598,4.4436860068259385
2402316,3,B000B651BG,"I agree with many previous reviews.  Gone are the effects of Hollywood, but the return of the monster from the sea is back!!  I felt like I was watching the classics.  Having read a quick review/write up about this film in Fangoria mag, I thought I would give it a chance.  I liked it a lot.  The black and white was awesome.  Great location shooting and who could pass up watching a flick with strippers and cameo's from the Director of those ""Toxic Avenger"" movies and of course, Ron Jeremy!

I want to touch base on the extras on this DVD. It's rare to find a DVD that has so much extra material for the purchase.  There are bloopers, gag reels, a detailed (long) ""making of"" which documents all cast and crew throughout the process.

Also, which struck me as a huge thumbs up was the fact that there was directorial and crew audio commentary on audio track2 as an added option.  This was cool because I am a fan of how movies are made and I enjoy listening to things directors and editors and Dp's have to say.  This was a huge added bonus and it shows that Winckler cares about his films enough to show the audience everything that goes into making this.

This DVD is worth the purchase on the extra's alone!  They even have an extra on the DVD dedicated to the soundtrack!!

All in all, this is a fun movie to watch and if you buy it, you will enjoy it. Have fun and don't forget...WATCH the extras, they don't come on these movie DVD's often!",1136332800,5,1449,4.2988929889298895
2402317,5,B000B651BG,"A great movie to watch and just enjoy.  Gone are the days of movie fun before all the special effects of todays films.  This is the way we all use watch movies; sitting on the edge of our seats, biting nails  and watching scary monsters come out of the sea.",1130544000,4,257,4.1
2402318,5,B000B651BG,"William Winckler has billed this film as ""a modern-day homage to the classic Universal-style horror films of the 1940s."" He's not off the mark either. Winckler has grabbed some of the essence of the British Hammer films and merged them with the old Universal films for a very unique horror film. And a low-budget one at that. Now folks, I watch cheesy low-budget films all the time, and frankly, you won't find the faults those films have, in Winckler's film. We have a good story, nice costumes and some interesting characters. If you knew what the film cost, you'd be shocked by the ""Blood Cove Creature's get-up."" Hell I was...and I don't know what the film cost. Frankly, I was expecting some cheesy rubber suit! But Winckler put his money where his creatures were and I loved the final result. Winckler has shown though that he's not gonna grab any old 2-bit actor from some local high school to appear in his films either. He's got everyone's favorite appearing and that adds to the fun. Lloyd Kaufman and Raven De La Croix also star in this movie and put in their usual ""above-board"" performances. Now I'm not gonna be a total ""homer"" and not find some fault with this movie. I thought some of the fight scenes were a tinge weak...but frankly, until I get out on the beach in those outfits and practice some Ultimate Fighting Championship moves, I'll back off on the critiques. Seriously folks, it's a good film that deserves a chance. Yeah, you can watch ""Urband Legends 3"" or ""The Prophecy 4"" but it's the same rehashed stuff. Here we have a film trying to resurrect quality from the good ole days and hoping to make a fan out of you. They sure caught me!",1125878400,13,1664,4.568561872909699
8082064,4,B000B651BG,"William Winkler is a unique filmmaker, who has a history of making campy features that simultaneously pay homage to and poke gentle fun at film tropes of yesteryear (e.g. ""The Double-D Avenger""). Here he takes on the Hammer horror films and the atomic age monster films simultaneously in a loving send up of creature features shown in glorious black and white. The film opens with a creature escaping into the ocean and scientists travelling to ""Shellvania"" to exhume the Frankenstein monster. This is low budget, but the direction is good with notably entertaining reaction shots. Along the way there are other monsters like a Wolfman (thank goodness they came with a pistol containing silver bullets). After digging the monster up, we cut to a Los Angeles modeling agency that wants to shoot bikini models out at Blood Cove, an event that leads to a grisly off-screen death by a distinctly Black Lagoonish creature. The photographer and crew escape to a science lab where they find Frankenstein's creature, who somewhat resembles Meatloaf.

Not that a film like this needs tons of exposition, but somehow Frankenstein and the sea creature engage in some comically bad fisticuffs with amusing slow motion effects that I loved. What exposition there is explains that Frankenstein's monster has been redesigned into the ultimate killing machine making wars unnecessary (just don't question the logic), while the sea creature is a deadly combination of barracuda, human, and black mamba...so there's a lot going on. There is a weird anti-terrorism bent to the plot with much clunky dialogue (""In a war of terror, the ultimate terror wins!"") Of course the ultimate terror is the Frankenstein monster, but there's still more: the Bride of Frankenstein shows up in a flashback, causing the monster to go rogue and engage in a killing spree, and among the pipe organ music cues, the ghost of Dr. Frankenstein engages in some scientific haunting of his own. Like I said, a lot is going on here. Eventually the monster sees the ghost of Dr. Frankenstein, which makes him want to invade a seaside burlesque house where Ron Jeremy and Lloyd Kaufman are enjoying Selena Silver (""as herself"") dance. The best part of this diversion is watching Ron Jeremy run. No matter, the monster ends up killing most everyone, and it all comes down to the monster (in elevator shoes) versus Dr. Frankenstein's ghost versus a photographer (played by Bill Winckler himself) in the lab. I won't reveal what happens next, but let's just say one character dies and romance blooms, though maybe not as you'd expect it to.

The DVD has a lot of great extras that really add to the enjoyment of the package. First there's the commentary with Bill Winckler, which is very informative and educational but also a lot of fun. He discusses how he loved the Universal monster movies, and discusses small details that really make the film, like how the Wolfman transforms into Butch Patrick, better known for his roles as Eddie Munster and as Mark in ""Lidsville"". I love that the film contains tons of little touches like that. Winckler also makes some interesting points about the anti-terrorism plotpoint and how it relates to an ""anti-fanatical religion"" theme. (I don't think there's ever been an ant-terrorism Frankenstein movie before, has there?) When they get to the scenes with Ron Jeremy, Winckler reveals that Ron was in a Disney kid's show called (if you're ready for this) ""Bone Chillers"", though he was unrecognizable under heavy makeup. Other extras include a trailer, deleted scenes (which were a tad boring), auditions, bloopers (watch for the denture drop), and two ""making of"" features that are interesting.

""William Winckler's Frankenstein vs. The Creature From Blood Cove"" is a very good contemporary homage to and spoof of creature features of the past. Fans of the genre should enjoy it immensely.",1473465600,,3881,5.023291925465839

8082067,1,B000B651BG,"Started to give this two stars, because the monster costumes aren't bad, but could not bring myself to do so.  This is more like spending time with the crew of a really low-budget girly magazine than a sci-fi spoof.  The filmmakers apparently promised all their stripper girlfriends camera time.  Definitely not for the family.",1464393600,,327,5.018518518518518
8082068,3,B000B651BG,"FRANKENSTEIN VS. THE CREATURE FROM BLOOD COVE is the brainchild of writer / producer / director / actor, William Winckler. The story is pretty basic- the title sea CREATURE escapes from the laboratory, and now the scientists who created it must go to Shellvania, and resurrect the FRANKENSTEIN monster. The well-meaning scientists need the monsters as secret weapons to end war, bringing about world peace (!). Uh-oh! While digging up FRANKENSTEIN's grave, our heroes are attacked by a werewolf! Luckily, they've brought their gun, loaded w/ silver bullets! In no time flat, the monster's body is secured! Meanwhile, back at Blood Cove, the CREATURE runs amok, terrifying unwary swimsuit models! Many cheeeze-cake shots are taken, as the CREATURE gets dangerously close. Ludicrous deaths ensue. FVTCFBC is another retro-sci-fi-horror film. As such, it has its moments, though it tends to drag in places. The rubber-y CREATURE is just as absurd as the big-shoed FRANK, making their fight scenes a dumbfounding, yet oddly entertaining experience. With these ultra-low-budget, black and white parodies / tribute films, you're either a fan or you're not. I love -most of- 'em, but you'll know very quickly whether this sort of thing is your cup of Schlock-O-Cola... P.S.- Watch for cameos by Troma trash-meister, Lloyd Kaufman and the one and only Ron Jeremy!...",1452384000,,1358,5.291666666666667

8082070,5,B000B651BG,"""Roger Corman"", ""Ed Wood"", ""From Hell it Came"", ""The Beach Girls and the Monster"", and more.... these are the names and films that OBVIOUSLY inspired William Winckler's satirical homage to a simpler time of horror... A time when all you needed was a monster, a bikini girl, black and white camera stock, and a love for the genre! Winckler and co. all tread the line wonderfully between hammy and straight with their acting, keeping the tongue-in-cheek nature of the movie but still keeping in character. As a fan of monster movies (something woefully rare these days), this little gem hits all the right notes and left me with the warm feeling I used to get as a kid watching hilariously bad (or awesomely bad!) monster movies on the UHF channels. Be on the lookout for indy film mainstays Ron Jeremy and Lloyd Kaufman too! All in all this is the closest thing to a modern day 'classic style' monster flick. ENJOY!",1426377600,,914,4.683229813664596
8082071,1,B000B651BG,"I bought this movie on DVD after reading a number of reviews praising it as being a tribute to classic monsters, including (obviously) the Frankenstein Monster and Creature from the Black Lagoon. There's also a werewolf. The dirt cheapness of the film didn't bother me in particular, but the fact that it's dull dull dull dull dull really did.

I also didn't go into it expecting the extended scenes of heavily siliconed women posing nude. If that's your thing, fine, but I bought this as a monster movie, not a titillation flick. The Ron Jeremy appearance was just weird.

The only good thing about this was the Creature costume, but even that didn't work out particularly well. The scenes with the Creature and Monster running at each other to battle on the beach were ridiculous beyond words.

Really, an atrociously bad, dull and dirty film, a waste of even the small amount of money I spent on it.",1345161600,,902,4.69620253164557
8082072,3,B000B651BG,"I stumbled across this flick in my continuing quest for B-Movie fodder (now that I'm regularly contributing prizes to the B-Movie Cast) and decided to check it out. I'd been wondering recently why old-style monster movies weren't being made nowadays, since modern technology should put doing so within the reach of talented amateurs.  This flick, from its promo material, seemed to fit that bill.  And it's a pretty decent movie.  I enjoyed it.  There are plenty of monsters and monster fights and the makeup/suits are pretty good looking, though the werewolf outfit (not the face) is a bit Muppety.  What surprised me, as it was billed as a homage to Universal and films of the 40s-50s, was the amount of nudity.  I'd expect that in an exploitation homage, or a Euro homage,or a modern film, but not something that claims lineage from Universal and AIP.  In its execution, the film reminded me of the Lost Skeleton of Cadavera, though it's not as successful.

The main problem I had with ""... Blood Cove"" were these: 1) The story needed more development: though the elements were good, they didn't come together to form a compelling whole; extraneous ideas should have been trimmed and the plot focused on the title conflict' the story should finish on the title characters, not with a deus-ex-machina ""twist."" 2) Though the cinematography was generally competent, the lighting made the movie look flat and uninteresting.  Consulting any Outer Limits episode would have helped, not to mention the movies this film was homaging.  Again, Cadavera did a better job in aping the ""classic"" look.  3) The acting was often campy when it would have been better served by being sincere.  Playing it straight is what saves a lot of Euro-horror flicks with stories just as underdeveloped as this one. 4) A full orchestral score, or something approaching one, would have helped.  The score, though well conceived, often sounded tinny to me.

Despite all that, I liked the picture. I enjoyed the attempt at a modern Frankenstein vs. ... film.  I just wish they'd pushed it a little further toward the material that inspired them.  I think there's a market for old-style horror movies, and this was a good attempt (despite the nudity).  That and better lighting would have raised this a star, at least, in my estimation.  I still enjoyed it more than the ""classic"" Dracula vs. Frankenstein, which I watched 2 days previously.  It was worth the few bucks I paid for it -- and it has a really good set of DVD extras.",1296172800,3,2501,4.828638497652582

If Lagosi or Karloff or Vincent Price etc...saw this caca they would linch him,and after watching this turkey it would be a mercy killing. The only thing old Universal about it is its in black and white. The sets stink,the actors are lousey,and the script appears to have been written by one on drugs,and bad ones.
