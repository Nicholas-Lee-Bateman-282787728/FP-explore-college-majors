7726143,1,B01DY89LWW,"Idiotic script, incredibly wooden acting (Madsen and Baldwin are fine, but then they should be). A very hard movie to watch because of the screenplay, the acting and the direction.",1465689600,2,180,5.033333333333333

7726146,3,B01DY89LWW,"I loved a Bronx Tale and with Lilo Broncado and Vincent D'nofrio, I expected a super hit.  The plot struggled to justify itself and it is obvious through the substandard acting.  Some of the choice of actors just seemed so out of place and out of character. This movie deviated far too much from the organic cast it should have had.  The movie had it's amusing high points however, overall I have to say it needs a lot of improvement.",1465430400,,434,4.4

8757271,1,B01DY89LWW,"I'm only twenty minutes in but oh my god this is bad. Everything about it is terrible: writing, directing, acting, photography, sets, music, even the stunts. I'm disturbed that the user ratings are as high as they are. I don't understand how films like this get made, while some of our greatest directors still fight to get their projects funded.",1482710400,,346,4.783333333333333

8757274,1,B01DY89LWW,HORRIBLE is all I can say...do NOT waste your time or money on this film!,1468368000,,73,3.933333333333333
8757275,3,B01DY89LWW,"Back in the Day,"" set in the late 1980s and the present day, is the story about Anthony Rodriguez (portrayed by the films writer, William DeMeo), a half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican teenager growing up on the streets of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, then an area with an ample share of racists, bullies, and social clubs, where guys with ties to organized crime kept tabs on happenings in the neighborhood.

After his mother (Annabella Sciorra, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle) dies and his father (Manny Perez, El Cntante) is run out of town, aspiring-boxer Anthony is taken under the wing of a mob boss (Michael Madsen, Kill Bill) and a tough-love trainer (Danny Glover, Lethal Weapon). When mob Don Gino Fratelli (Alec Baldwin, TVs 30 Rock) and his crew conspire to ruin his career, Anthony, his friend Matty (Joe DOnofrio) and his girl (Shannen Doherty, Beverly Hills 90210) brace themselves for a tough, hard fight.

Back in the Day draws elements from the Rocky movies, Raging Bull, and Cinderella Man  as well as lots of other fight flicks  in this melodramatic tale of a kid from a humble background trying to navigate the obstacles of a tough environment in his pursuit of a goal. Unfortunately, the film adds nothing innovative to an overly familiar narrative. The performances are merely routine, and the overused plot makes it hard to buy into the plight of Anthony, an amalgam of every cliched good-hearted movie underdog.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release.",1468022400,,1497,4.972
8757276,1,B01DY89LWW,It was so bad I could only watch 40 percent,1466812800,,43,3.4
8757277,1,B01DY89LWW,This movie is TRASH!!! TRASHHHHHHH! I'm so upset I wasted $6.99 to rent this movie. I could have bought a pack of cigarettes! The acting was ridiculous. They put a couple big names in the movie to make you think it's a good movie. I should get a refund!!,1466380800,3,254,4.204081632653061
8757278,1,B01DY89LWW,"Very cliched story; with really spectacularly bad acting.  I had a hard time watching the whole thing and left several times, hoping it would get better when I rejoined my family when we were watching it.",1465948800,,204,4.666666666666667
