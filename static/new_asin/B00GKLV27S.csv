8624106,4,B00GKLV27S,"I thought it was a well-played out B-Horror movie. The Zombie Pirates make-up were hideous at the beginning when they first show 'em, however i didn't like how it ends, that was wack even for a low b-movie like this. That is why i didn't give the film the fifth star.",1468108800,,267,4.254901960784314
8624107,4,B00GKLV27S,Needed a bit more skin and bloodshed but not a bad no-budget horror flick. Sarah French (the lead) is very attractive and the zombie make-up was pretty good.,1451260800,,157,4.642857142857143

8624109,5,B00GKLV27S,"A great throwback to the older Italian zombie movies. It even has a Zombie Parrot. Plus the talented lead, Sarah French does a great job with her beauty and grace!!",1393200000,2,164,4.5
8624110,4,B00GKLV27S,This movie was okay but took a while to take off. Too much build up and not enough scenes of the pirates.,1393200000,,105,3.8181818181818183
8624111,4,B00GKLV27S,"Zombie Pirates was a nice slightly different film with it not being a zombie film with zombies coming from the sea to spread a plague amongst the living. The movie star Sarah French as a high end thief who's latest haul has drawn the attention of the wrong people. They have decided that she possesses the necessary drive and lack of squeamishness that she will be perfect to make a deal with a band of pirates who were killed after the Battle of New Orleans for being cannibals. She must complete 5 tasks in 5 nights. If she succeeds then she gets the silver of the pirates, fail and she will become their next meal. To add to her complications is the police are getting closer to her for the original robbery. The film is all Sarah French so if you are a fan of her or her alter-ego Scarlett Salem then you will enjoy this. I really liked the locations and the feel of the film. It has a slow burn quality to it that I appreciate.",1392940800,2,932,4.241573033707865
8624112,2,B00GKLV27S,"I really wish I could say this was a fun movie but it really sucks!
The only good thing about this dvd is it also has one of the Blind Dead movies  ""Horror of the Zombies"" AKA "" The Ghost Galleon"" on it!",1392249600,4,203,3.7209302325581395
