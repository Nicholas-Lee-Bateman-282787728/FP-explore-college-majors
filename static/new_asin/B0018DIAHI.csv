8269598,5,B0018DIAHI,"If you know what to expect, this will deliver. Hilarious cover too -- displayed with pride on my DVD rack!",1478131200,,106,4.35
8269599,5,B0018DIAHI,"A must have for an Otto & George fan, especially now after his passing, and if you decide to withhold from purchasing, there are hours of Otto & George online of his many O&A appearances.  His act was billed as triple x ventriloquist mind you, so it's not for everyone, but very funny, very real, in a word, inimitable.",1410480000,,319,4.406779661016949
8269600,5,B0018DIAHI,"Very funny if you like raw comedy.  About as politically incorrect as you can get.  I had the  pleasure of seeing him live.  Sadly, he  passed away recently.",1406505600,,157,4.464285714285714
8269601,1,B0018DIAHI,"After reading the very well written and humorous NYTimes obituary of this ventriloquist, I was intrigued. I like humor, and am not put off by ""obscene language."" But this is not humor, except perhaps for second and third graders, who are delighted by poo-poo references. The level of performance is appallingly bad, which I must admit fits perfectly with the level of intelligence (if it can be called that) of the performers. And as if that weren't awful enough, skipping through the DVD merely proved that it was moronically repetitious. I didn't know Amazon ever carried such execrable merchandise; while it may indicate an open and democratic policy of availability of goods, which I applaud, Otto & George is 'way beyond the pale. In fact, even second and third graders might feel insulted.",1402272000,,795,4.984962406015038
