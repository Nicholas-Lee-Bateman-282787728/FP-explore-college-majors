8709406,5,B00V6C65AK,"Now that I have BOTH Disney CINDERELLA movies for my home viewing--one the 1950 animated version I first saw when I was three years old, the other the 2015 live version, I couldn't be happier with Disney's CINDERELLA. This is a fairy tale done right for both versions, although Richard Madden's prince is way more interesting in the live version. Helena Bonham Carter brings her own brand of eccentricity to the fairy godmother, and Cate Blanchett's stepmother is more chilling because her performance conveys both the malice of the animated stepmother and the pain that warped the live stepmother's view of the world. Lily James is a beautiful Cinderella in and out of her resplendent ball gown, although--in her final scene in the house she grew up in, where she appears in an old, faded dress--she comes off as most dignified and royal. The live version does have a psychologically richer human story. As for the animated version, it has a scene or two that the live version couldn't duplicate--especially the scene of mice and birds warbling ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" as they ""fix the dress for Cinderelly.""  The 2015 live Cinderella is arguably an animal whisperer, and her little friends do help her in a climactic moment. Both these Disney versions are splendid retellings of the fairy tale, and the live version Blu-Ray has a fun selection of special features.",1520726400,,1379,4.868085106382979
8709407,1,B00V6C65AK,"This version of Cinderella is not compatible with American blueray or DVD players.  It was shipped from England so has a different format.  There was no return information in the package.
We were able to play it using a laptop and connector, but are disappointed that it isn't what we wanted.",1503792000,,292,4.705882352941177
