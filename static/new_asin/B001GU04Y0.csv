3620038,5,B001GU04Y0,Hi everyone. I am 21 years old and I was 11 when the Powerpuff Girls first premired on Cartoon Network. I love this show. I was making a big fuss to get it. Awesome show in an awesome package that anyone who loves the PPG will be dying to get. I love my dvd and I watched the whole series in four days.,1233878400,,302,3.8095238095238093
3620039,5,B001GU04Y0,"No long review here;just wanted to say that yes,I am a guy,and yes I thought this was a great cartoon! One of the reasons is because it had some of the best villains ever! I always thought MO--JO JOJO! was a scream with the way he talked. Also can anyone say that the demonic HIM was not one of the freakiest villains in a kid's cartoon show!? The Gang Green Gang's Ace,Snake,Grubber,Big Billy and Lil Arturo also provided some good laughs!

Thank you Cartoon Network! Now please just do the same for some of your other cartoon hits like Dexter's Lab,Billy and Mandy etc.",1233014400,2,571,4.490384615384615
3620040,4,B001GU04Y0,"I'm 16, I remember when I was a lot younger before my mom decided to buy cable sitting in my room staring at a fuzzy screen which was supposed to be Cartoon Network, regardless of the fuzz I could at least hear some of the shows, this happened to be one of them. When we finally got cable I didn't stop watching it, every time it was on I made the effort, and then it was taken off... I was devastated.

My two friends and I had even designated ourselves each a character when we played at recess, we made necklaces and everything. So I'm sitting there, watching tv, and I see the commercial, and I TWEAKED OUT. My mom was in the next room and came in to see what was wrong, I asked her if I could get it, and she just smiled at me and said sure. I pre-ordered it two days early and have been anticipating it's arrival.

And now, my whole elementary school life, is sitting in front of me, in an organized series of disks, waiting to be watched and it's memories to come flowing out of every crevice of my being. =D I'm SO HAPPY.",1232755200,,1029,4.089108910891089
3620041,5,B001GU04Y0,"Like I said before: ""Way before he broke ground for an orphanage that houses imaginary friends, Craig McCracken created the world's youngest superhero team !""

Now the Powerpuff Girls are back again with a brand new COMPLETE series set!!!  This commemorative 10th anniversary collection has six double-sided discs each one representing a complete season.  So let me break it down for those of you in the know.

Season 1:
It's pretty much exactly the same as the complete first season set which is also available.  So see my review on that as well as my fave episodes and special extras.

Season 2:
Favorite episode: ""The Powerpuff Girls Best Rainy Day Adventure Ever"" - In that Richard Scarry titled episode, the Girls turn a rainy day in Townsville into a fun day of pretend.
Extras: They're features most likely taken from other PPG DVDs such as the commentaries done by Mojo Jojo and the Mayor.  I liked those.

Season 3:
Favorite episode: ""Powerprof"" - The Professor dons a special super suit so he can spend more time with his girls.  But the Professor really isn't all that's cracked up to be.
Extras: The music videos by Shonen Knife and The Apples in Stereo.  I just wish they also added the videos by Devo and Cherish, though....

Season 4:
Favorite episode: ""Nuthin' Special"" - Blossom has ice breath.  Bubbles habla espanol.  And Buttercup ?  Well, see for yourself.
Extras: A Mayor blooper reel and the holiday special ""Twas the Fight Before Christmas"".

Season 5:
Favorite episode: ""See Me, Feel Me, Gnomey"" - A lot of my favorite episodes are from the 5th season, but I have to say I liked the lost rock opera episode the most where the girls trade their powers to a magical gnome for a new way of life.  I don't know why they never aired it on TV in the first place; it's a great episode despite that almost all the dialogue is sung.
Extras: 3 Mayor promos and one called ""Mitch Rocks"" where Mitch Mitchellson tells you what's cool and what's lame.  So far the set has only one of those three shorts.  Why can't they put in the other two ?  Now THAT'S lame.

Season 6:
Favorite episode: ""Mo' Linguish"" - My favorite Mojo Jojo episode has the evil simian teaching an English Speaking class making Townsville's citizens talk elaborately like him.
Extras: An impressive in-depth documentary on series creator Craig McCracken as well as his latest special episode as seen on Cartoon Network: ""The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!!""

In conclusion, these tiny titans are still the cutest super heroines that ever graced Cartoon Network's airwaves.  Whether or not you own previous DVDs including the complete first season, this super set will be THE penultimate Powerpuff set EVER !  And if you take out all six inserts out of their cases, you'll discover a special poster designed by Craig himself !

So as the saying goes like always, ""So once again, the day is saved !  Thanks to the Powerpuff Girls !""",1232582400,27,2905,4.6936758893280635
3620042,5,B001GU04Y0,"Oh wow I loved, loved, loved this show as a kid! And now every single episode is now in one pretty package!
I was ecstatic when I discovered they were releasing the complete series on DVD, And after I keep checking for a season 2 dvd and nothing came up, I feared that I would never see a powerpuff dvd again! Boy was I wrong!
The series set is a great thing for any powerpuff fan as it's loaded with extras Including: The Original short that started it all ""The WhoopA** Girls"" the 2 original pilots from the ""What A Cartoon Show"" ""Meat Fuzzy Lumkins"" & ""Crime 101"", A load of classic PPG promos, The christmas special ""Twas The Fight Before Christmas"", a great all new 30+ minute documentary featuring interviews with Craig, Voice Actors, and other people who worked on the show, a never before seen in the states episode ""See Me, Feel Me, Gnomey"", and the all new 10th Anniversary episode (Which was just aired this past monday in the states) ""The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!!""
And much more including commentaries from Mojo Jojo and The Mayor.
My only gripes with it are that the DVD's are double sided (Which is not that big a deal) ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" is not included in the set, and the menus on the DVD are kinda boring and theres a Cartoon Network bug on the menus (Which is also not that big a deal)

But beacuse my gripes are only small little things that don't really effect the DVD I will still give this otherwise fantastic set a 5 out of 5 as this is one of my faviorte shows of all time! ""And So Once Again The Day Is Saved Thanks To The Powerpuff Girls!"" THE END",1232496000,42,1582,4.326599326599327
3620043,5,B001GU04Y0,"Before I dive in, I am a 17 year old American girl whose childhood is now in a neatly packed box sitting in front of me.  I grew up with this series, I remember clearly the pilot episode(s) before the series even became a series.  I remember pretty much every episode.  This is an amazing box-set and I don't see why you wouldn't buy this it.

This 10th anniversary edition box-set went BEYOND my expectations, just by putting in the first disk, and let me tell you why.  The next paragraphs are from a animation fanatic/hopeful animator.

Craig McCracken attended CalArts (California Institute of the Arts) and while there, he created the Whoopa** Girls.  Which is now what we know and love as the Powerpuff Girls.  On the first disk on the special features is  his film from CalArts that stars the Whoopa** Girls.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've been wanting to see this for a long time.  I was AMAZED at how similar his CalArts film was compared to the Powerpuff Girls series.  The opening dialogue, the narration, the character designs, the villains, it was almost the exact same.  In the film the girls have to fight the Gang Green Gang and the Amoeba Boys.  And THEN a Lou Romano did the voice for the amoeba boys.  And if you're a animated film fanatic like me, then you know Lou Romano works at Pixar and also does voices for the films, including Linguini for Ratatouille  What I'm trying to get at is, Lou Romano also attended CalArts around the same time as Craig McCracken.  And that just blew my mind further that Lou Romano and Craig McCraken were working together on this soon to be amazingly popular cartoon show.

Another thing that I am ridiculously happy about is that the pilot episodes were included in this set.  I am extremely content and this box-set deserves 5 stars.  But there was one thing that I didn't find in my boxset, and that is the ""...custom panoramic poster designed by series creator Craig McCracken.""  Other then that I am still content as ever and if you'll excuse me I'm going to go bask in my childhood.",1232496000,5,2040,4.577348066298343
3620044,5,B001GU04Y0,"I remember this show as a kid and it really never gets old. I love this show, I still do. There are A LOT of bonus features. Very fun to watch.

this was a short review.
This show is awesome.",1232409600,,191,3.775
3620045,4,B001GU04Y0,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers. There hasn't been a comprehensive release of ""The Powerpuff Girls"" and that is now being remedied by this release. As a 37 year old cartoon fan, The PPG was always very reminiscent of the cartoons that I grew up with. I can't wait for this set to be released.",1228176000,3,304,4.350877192982456
3620046,5,B001GU04Y0,"Here it is in all its glory!  Despite the random, haphazard packaging of episodes on older DVD releases with even menu options that were inconsistent, the Powerpuff Girls finally get the royal send-off in ONE PACKAGE.

So who are the Powerpuff Girls?  They are the by-product of Professor Utonium's desire to create girls using sugar, spice and everything nice except things go awry when he accidentally spills ""Chemical X"" into the concotion.  The result:  3 little girls with super-powers.  Blossom is their leader who is level-headed in most situations.  Buttercup is the Powerpuff who will most likely charge into a fight without regard to consequences.  Bubbles, despite her superpowers, is most easily scared and is the most sensitive 'puff of the bunch.

The double-meanings and creativity of the episodes were a delight and it was something that I used to watch guiltily as a 20-something man.  They were downright hilarious, though, so it was hard not to watch.  The violence might be a little too much for some parents, but my 5-year old daughter knows that it's fake and plays it up for the humor that it is.  She hasn't gone around the house bashing things up nor has she exhibited any violent tendencies.  Still, parents be warned and decide based on your own lifestyle and viewing choices.

The only minor complaint that I have is that it doesn't include the theatrical movie, but I'm sure that the lawyers can be well-paid and thanked for that licensing issue.  Still, the movie is available for purchase separately, so no harm done.

The other minor complaint is the use of double-sided DVDs which naturally brings the price down, but makes the average parent a nervous wreck in terms of keeping the DVD surface clear of scratches.

Still, it's nice to finally have the entire TV series out, including the 78th episode never aired in the States.  My daughter and I are ready to adventure the complete 'puffs!",1227225600,33,1924,4.867692307692308
3620047,1,B001GU04Y0,"I really hated giving this a one star, but I think it deserves it. The box was a little beat up, I could deal with that, but as i started watching the episodes I understood why people complained about the skipping. The 1st season disk one side A the last ep. called Ice Sore froze and jammed my DVD player. So i had to force the DVD out of the player. I decided to try the 2nd season disk 2. Side A had no issues but side B had issues and i had to force that disk out of my DVD player. I was thinking i should go ahead and give the other disks a chance but at this point i was tired and i really didn't feel like forcing disks out of my DVD player if the others froze. I don't think it's Amazon's fault, i think it's the seller's fault for selling crappy DVDs. I hope they come out with a new version of this DVD.",1514592000,2,813,3.8452380952380953
3620048,2,B001GU04Y0,Several of the discs skiped straight out of the box. My kids will still watch through the skipping but I am not impressed for the price. Disc 5 side A does not play at all.,1513382400,,172,3.942857142857143
3620049,5,B001GU04Y0,I love it. I think its much better then the one airing on tv now.,1511136000,,65,3.4

3620051,1,B001GU04Y0,"I finally got around to watching this, and sadly the episodes either freeze right away, or start and then skip right to the end. Haven't been able to watch one full episode yet. The DVD cases also look homemade, which I wouldn't care about if they actually worked. I can't even return it or contact the seller because my return window has closed. Waste of $45. Very disappointed!",1508284800,,379,4.588235294117647

3620053,3,B001GU04Y0,"I LOVE THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!!! It's One Of My Favorite Animated Series, But When I Got The Box Set And Played Season 1, Things Went Well At First Until The Episode ""Major Competition / Mr. Mojo's Rising"" When It Started Glitching, And Then The Same Thing Happen To Season 5 Episodes ""The Boys Are Back in Town"",""Pee Pee G's / Boy Toys"" &
""Silent Treatment / Sweet 'n' Sour"" And The Season 6 Episode

3620054,5,B001GU04Y0,I am a 21 year old guy and love this show. The main reason I bought it is because it is nostalgic: I loved this show growing up and still do. Yes the disks are double sided but as long as you're 5+ and careful it shouldn't be a problem. No scratches and every disk worked fine when I got it. It us definitely worth the price!,1501113600,,325,3.8656716417910446
3620055,1,B001GU04Y0,The DVDs skipped. I would have returned them however my puppy got ahold of the discs. Very disappointed.,1498176000,,104,4.833333333333333
3620056,5,B001GU04Y0,Love the original Powerpuff Girls and was glad to get the complete series. I just wish the box itself was smaller as it takes up a lot of shelf space.,1497225600,,150,4.033333333333333
3620068,3,B001GU04Y0,I love the Powerpuff girls. I always have and wanted this box set desperately. I have no problem with the show. It's just as funny as I remember. The problem is that the disc are double sided. I bought one set and three discs were scratched and two refused to play. Shame on cartoon Network!,1495065600,,291,4.3090909090909095
3620069,1,B001GU04Y0,Bought this for my kids so they can enjoy the original powerpuff girls. Unfortunately the first disc quit working after the second use. We tried the second disc and it started skipping. Very sad. I returned it.,1493337600,,210,4.702702702702703
3620070,5,B001GU04Y0,"Update: just realized it does come with the poster Incase you missed it, take out every pamphlet with the episodes and turn them over and combine them to complete a poster definitely a surprise! I didn't see that coming!!!!

I am only reviewing the box set!
For me it shipped randomly but I received it one day. Yes one day!
So basically I ordered this for my Amazing little mini me. Who is in love with the ppgz . All disc were new for me, and no scratches as I was afraid of. The only reason  I gave it a 4 star was because it didn't come with the poster.  Which leads me to believe this isn't the legit box set and I was going to give it 3 stars but I know my little girl was filled with joy and the poster wouldn't be missed. I recommend this product if you only want the double sided disc set.",1488844800,,798,4.0062893081761
3620071,1,B001GU04Y0,"Like the review posted before me, a fraction of the episodes are unwatchable. One disc did have scratches on one side, the others looked fine but had playback issues nonetheless. Every disc seems to have problems.",1487203200,,213,4.944444444444445
3620072,1,B001GU04Y0,"I just got the box set containing all 6 seasons of powerpuff girls.  About a third of the episodes are unwatchable due to skipping.  The disks look fine but the fact that they are double sided disks seem to have messed up the data on many episodes. It's is very disheartening as I just purchased them brand new.  :(  yes, sad face",1485302400,,330,4.274193548387097
3620073,1,B001GU04Y0,"Well, this review is negative for a very simple reason - it was listed as a new item, but was NOT delivered in new condition. The shrink wrap was well done, but not factory. 2 of the 6 discs have some minor wear to them. They play fine, but that's not the point. Also, the box says it comes with a collector's poster, which my 4yr daughter was excited about. There was no poster. So, item marked as new, appears new at first glance, but is missing a piece that was included in the new package, and, 2 discs have been used. Very simple issue here - if it's used, sell it as used. If it's new... Etc. I love the show and so does my daughter... This should've been an easy 5star review. But I simply will not reward dishonesty or ignorance.",1481155200,,737,4.160839160839161

3620090,3,B001GU04Y0,"Please note that I'm ONLY reviewing this DVD box set and NOT the show itself. If I were reviewing the show, this would get 5 stars. With the new show out (which I don't watch), I felt the need to revisit this old cartoon. I was thrilled to find out that they sold the ENTIRE show bundled together for a more than reasonable price. Usually, TV shows make you buy individual seasons, I'm glad to buy it this way. This DVD bot set includes 6 color coded cases with six DVDs. Seasons 1-2 blue resembling Bubbles. 3-4 red for Blossom, and 5-6 green for Buttercup. Sounds great right? Well there is a major issue I have with this. The disks are double sided. This means that you literally flip the disk around to watch each half of each season, With double sided disks, there is no labeled sided. This  means that each side is easily exposed to be scratched. So when handling this be VERY careful!! These double sided disks were very common about ten years ago. As a child, I had many bad experiences with them. I thought I had seen the last of them until I purchased this which happens to be a nearly 10 old release. This being a show aimed for children, I hate that they used this method. Children will scratch the disks, eventually. I strongly suggest that younger users get help from older and steadier hands if you want to get the longest lifespan out of this set. I found it surprising how lightweight this set is for its size. To be completely honest, this set does feel rather cheaply produced. I've seen higher quality in milk cartons than the type of cardboard that this box is made out of. It is very thin and feels low quality. Mine arrived with a few large creases in it. But that's just a nit-pick. I do wish that they used a harder case though. Other than that, this case has very nice artwork of the Powerpuff Girl's eyes on the cover (as you can see from the image). I like that. Each season comes with a paper guide, displaying all of the episodes that this disk has. It even distinguishes the different sides of the disk as ""side: A"" and ""side: B"". Overall, I think that this DVD set is a GREAT value if you are a fan of the show. It is the best, if not the only way you can purchase a DVD copy of this series. I am thankful that they at least decided to produce this in DVD form at all. These days, it is rare for classic cartoons to get a DVD release. I wish the world would show more respect for the animation department and produce OFFICAL DVDs for cartoon shows more often. Besides my major issues with this, I highly recommend buying this. This is a super charming cartoon and is absolutely worth watching in however way you can. I hope I have helped you out. Thank you for reading my review!",1463961600,15,2711,4.284600389863548

3620097,5,B001GU04Y0,"Ah, the sweet aroma of nostalgia. I feel unless this show was part of your past/childhood or you have checked it out for yourself at some point, it's kind of hard to describe its awesomeness. I mean, you have three 5 year-old girls created in a lab who fight crime before bedtime. That's the premise, and it's right then and there you decide how you feel about it. When I was five, the idea of these little girls the same age as me being larger than life and fighting crime was amazing. Looking back on it now, I still enjoy the show, not just for nostalgic's sake but also because of the the differing personalities of each girl, inside jokes, inuendos, and simple humor it plays on. I think the packing was done well. The front cover shows the girls' signature large eyes with Blossom in the middle and Buttercup and Bubbles at her side.",1448668800,,839,4.419354838709677

3620203,4,B001GU04Y0,"I LOVED the Powerpuff Girls as a kid, so I decided to pick this complete series up, which was a $50 gamble, I needed a new show to watch, so I figured this would be a good one, especially since I hadn't seen all 6 seasons.

Let's just get the packaging out of the way... Pathetic. Wii cases, all liner noted for the first 5 seasons but not season 6, only 1 double sided disc per season, some scratches & fingerprints on about 3 disks that didn't affect play at least, & covers that looked like they were printed.

Now for what matters most, the review for the actual show that was unharmed due to pathetic packaging:

Some of my favorite one-three time episode villains include a classmate of The Powerpuff Girls (Melvin) who became a Radioactive Glue Monster, a Radioactive Hamster,  Abracadaver, Cat (Cat Man Do), The Boogeyman, & the modern family super villains (that's all I can think of off the top of my head). I'm sure there are others.

My favorite regular villains are (In this order) are Him, The Gang Green Gang, Mojo Jojo, Princess, & Seduca. My favorite good characters/Heros are (Be it or one episode or all) - In order: Buttercup, Blossom, Bubbles, Mrs. Beluem, the Professor, Major Glory, & The Mayor

One thing I love that you never see in superhero cartoons hardly is that well you know how say for example the villains in a Batman or Spider-Man cartoon might spend the whole time trying to find out his identity or capture/harm him or people he knows/loves or take over the world and it never even happens?

Well it does in The Powerpuff Girls (The identity things is non-existent here) villains actually succeed quit often in fact, more than any superhero cartoon probably, even the girls may make bad choices at times or be defeated & harmed in shocking ways, heck, they were even turned into dogs in an episode!!! The girls make another Powerpuff girl whose name was Bunny that DIED in an episode!!! Now that's something you don't see in almost any superhero cartoon without the character returning at some point or in some incarnation, Bunny never returned, she was retarded too.

The Powerpuff Girls has a ton of variety of things they do throughout the seasons other than the best ones where they battle their regular or one-two time villains, & catching the common robbers/crooks, they also may be their own villain by stealing or lying, having to watch someone else's  baby, getting a sun burn, dealing with animal rights activists, they even have what I think is the funniest episode ever having Mojo Jojo as their baby-sitter, he even turned the Powerpuff Girls & the city into dogs, they have an episode where the girls are afraid of cooties, silent black & white cartoons, a harmless substitute teacher that's a monster (episode is about judging), setting the professor up on a date, helping the Mayor with a  re-accruing nightmare, even an episode that was based on The Beatles with tons of Beatles references, an episode that takes place in the old west, & even an episode that was a psychedelic musical!!! & many, many more various episodes (for the best & worst) but never like most superhero shows, or just most cartoons for that matter that generally would not be much different from previous episodes or seasons, that's also what sets The Powerpuff Girls apart from other cartoons, it's boldness & the fact that it has humor that would probably appeal to adults more than kids, this show is unlike any cartoon show you'd ever see before, now, or since, it's a show of it's own kind, even in the change of it's quality, but thankfully it ended before it got ""bad"",  heck, it be called ""pretty good"" at the very least which is more than I could say for many shows that DIDN'T last 6 seasons.

Mojo Jojo baby-sitting funniest episode I've ever seen!

The Mayor dumbest character in any show I've ever seen, but is often the funniest & ridiculous character.

The movie I never liked & like many of the TV shows that get their own movie, it didn't live up to the quality of the TV show itself. I would never recommend the movie & if you've only seen the movie then don't let that be what you base your decision on getting this series on, this complete series is FAR better & more fun than I remembered.

Introduced my young boys who weren't around when the show first appeared.  ""Powerpuff Girls????"" they sneared.  ""Really, Dad?  That's for girls!""  About halfway through one episode I called up on Netflix  when they weren't looking and they were all over the Powerpuff Girls.  They loved the references to one of their other favorite gems dear ol' Dad introduced them to: Dexter's Lab.  They loved the punches and the kicking but most of all, they loved the humor.  And who could do anything other than love Bubbles?  My boys run around mimicking the characters all the time now.  The Powerpuff Girls are still cool.  Netflix only has the first couple seasons, this is the whole set.  Others have commented that the last few seasons were not quite up to par, and that is probably true, but the boys still watch them and there are a few gems in the mix even that far out in the show's run.

The disc is double sided, be careful not to scratch it and take care of it. These disc includes only English and sub as their language.

3620244,5,B001GU04Y0,"Ever since I was a little kid and first saw this at just six years old, I was always interested in this show. I grew to love it and is now one of my favorite shows of all time, even being the 18, almost 19 year old that I am. For quite awhile I was never really able to buy the whole series since most of the time they only realeased parts of the series. I wanted to get the whole show at once, and it finally came true.

This is a great box set, and I plan on watching the whole thing again. Since there are six seasons, there are six discs, each one has two sides, so for example when you're done watching season one side A, you can flip it over to side B. I know some People won't like this since they might be afraid if the discs being scrached, but if you're careful, and know how to handle them wright in the first place, it shouldn't be a problem.

Each season has a piece of paper with it that shows you the episodes. And the cool thing is that if you take all six pieces and put the together, it makes a pretty cool poster that show the ppgs fighting all the magor villains in the show, even the rowdyruff boys are in it.

Another cool thing is the special features. They include over 30 hours of bonuses such as commercials for the powerpuff girls, all the specials, the pilot episodes from what they were originaly going to be called, and even a documentary with Craig McCracken and how the show came into being. Basically the only thing that wasn't included is the ppg movie, but that is understandable, since I plan on getting that to so I can complete my collection anyway.

So in the end, I am extremely happy with my purches, and I will watch this for many years. Must buy.",1387152000,5,1689,4.124620060790273

That could've been overlooked had it not been for the DVD's themselves. They completely covered in fingerprints. Like you couldn't take time to clean them off before you sent them to me.

I recently purchased this box set and was very excited to receive it. When I first opened it, the first thing I noticed was the poor quality of the storage box. It felt like it was made of paper. It definitely was not going to hold up to much abuse at all. Not a huge deal though, so I was still happy. When I pulled out a DVD, the cover insert was obviously poorly made. It was covered in printer lines and looked like the images had been scaled up because they were distorted and blurry. But, you're not really buying a DVD set for the cover art, so it wasn't a deal breaker. Upon opening the DVD case, I experienced what quite a few others have. The inserts were there, but the discs were in absolutely horrible condition; scratches and fingerprints were on each side. Granted I didn't try out the discs to see if they worked, but they definitely should not have looked like that. This was the case with all of the discs. It felt like the set had been used and then re-shrink wrapped and passed off as new. I was extremely disappointed. But to top it all off, not only were the DVD cases flimsy, but they were actually USED WII DISC CASES! I cannot believe this and it actually feels pretty insulting to receive such a poorly put together product, especially when it doesn't do justice to one of my favorite childhood shows.

Needless to say I will be exchanging this product, and hopefully I will receive one that at least has no fingerprints or scratches on the discs. But Wii cases? Really? Come on.",1361577600,11,1621,4.364238410596027

Alot of people I know like me, had watched the series in their childhood and got so attached to the storyline & characters. The Powerpuff Girls is a series created by Craig McCracken, he also created another series called Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends. The storyline behind The Powerpuff Girls is that Professor Utonium created three little girls by using the ingredients Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice along with Chemical X. The Powerpuff Girls: Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup was born with their ultra superpowers to stop crime and save the city of Townsville. I find Chemical X as a incredible ingredient. It's quite mysterious and the girls got their amazing powers and abilities from it. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are not only superheroes, they are also kindergarten students who attend at the school Pokey Oaks. The series was a huge success and is one of Cartoon Network's well known shows along with Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, etc. If you a PPG fan this is truly made for you, also for newcomers, if you like watching cute little girls kicking bad guys butts... then, this show is for you too!!!",1356048000,,1201,4.980099502487562

I thought I would buy it because... well, I didn't have a good enough reason not to. So I sent off for it and waited anxiously for its arrival. It showed up right on schedule.  I excitedly opened the box and pulled out my marvelous box set.  It looked as if it had never been opened as it was still in its shrink wrap and everything.  But upon opening it I found that many of the discs were scratched and some were even covered in finger prints, The issue here is I hadn't even touched a disc yet and they had clearly been used and damaged.  No big deal... Maybe it was just a fluke in the system right?  Maybe an inconsiderate customer just re plastic wrapped it and passed it off as new in a return.  So I sent it back and patiently waited for my new set still pretty excited.  Upon this sets arrival It to was wrapped in plastic and upon opening it the discs seemed to be in pretty good shape.  I was excited and thought I had finally gotten a new set when I noticed all of the pamphlets from inside the cases were missing.  On the back of these is where the panoramic poster is.  It honestly isn't truly a big deal but when I am lead to believe I am buying a new unused product I expect it to be exactly that.  I probably won't go through the trouble of returning this one if all the discs are working just because I'm sick of dealing with this nonsense.",1350432000,7,1513,4.0200668896321075
3620356,5,B001GU04Y0,"I know. Corny gag, but it's one that keeps coming up every time Blossom, Bubbles and Bud... er, Buttercup do what they do. With the soul exception of the movie, this is everything that was produced by Craig and Co., starting with Whoopass Stew back at Cal Arts, moving through the ""What A Cartoon"" era then into the six series, plus the 10th anniversary special, that would shake the world of animation. This is as near as the American cartoon had got to taking on the anime world at that time and so much that has followed has this series of cartoons to thank for it.

Think about it. Before Puff, the only real action you got was in shows such as He-Man or Thundercats, and girls animation was pretty stagnant. Almost rank, in fact. Then you had the problem of having to sit through it as an adult to humour the kiddiwinks. I'm not saying that it was all bad but the producers of much of it made it as close to purgatory as they possibly could. By the time Craig McCracken, Genndy Tartakovsky and the rest of that lot were doing their thing at Hanna Barbera, the big cartoon revival that had started off with such well meant projects as Roger Rabbit was beginning to falter, so the appearance of Two Stupid Dogs and, later, Dexter's Laboratory foreshadowed greater things.

The series proved, for example, that cute could also be strong. Three ""perfect little girls"" that, when provoked, could knock the stuffing out of the biggest turkey was something we hadn't seen before. Even Wonder Woman couldn't pull that trick off! It also proved that a story, written intelligently, could keep the target audience entertained while not boring the parents to tears. If you were paying attention, you'd spot the jokes that the younger viewers would probably miss but both would get a laugh somewhere along the line. It proved that adults can enjoy animation too.

Without Puff, would you even have My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic, to name but one show of many that owe so much? So thanks to all that contributed, including the person that originally provided the sugar, spice, everything nice and a can of Whoopass.",1350259200,,2111,4.669354838709677

3620359,1,B001GU04Y0,"I've already returned this for a replacement but am still having issues with the new product. Here's a list of problems I have with this item:
1. The packaging is flimsy. The box holding the discs is not a heavy stock, it is thin and bends easily
2. The DVD inserts were missing in my first order. The replacement discs did include them however.
3. My first order had issues playing after the first viewing. These are all double sided DVDs, which are notoriously crappy.  After just one viewing we experienced skipping and the disc not even being recognized by the DVD player and Xbox unit.  All discs became unwatchable. Thankfully Amazon sent a replacement.
4. The replacement has had immediate problems with one of the discs not even loading in my DVD player. I can get it to load in my Xbox unit but it skips heavily. This is on the very first play - there are no scratches or damages to the surface of the disc.

The content of the box set is fine, but I cannot recommend this at all given the large amount of quality issues we have encountered.

EDITED 5/15/14 - Here it is two years later and literally 2/3 of these discs will not play properly.  We have taken care to keep the discs in great condition, yet they skip and freeze constantly. My daughter just had a meltdown because out of two discs she couldn't get a single episode to play properly.  There are no scratches visible on the discs, it is just terrible quality.

The box was clean, not dented, nicely printed and looks brand new. The DVD covers themselves were printed like how you might remember TV screens look like back in the 90s. However, I'm completely positive that it was a stylistic choice seeing as the logo and backside of the DVD cases are crisply printed. The DVD ""table of content""/poster sheets were also printed nicely. Only problem I found were two of the sheets were carelessly put in the cases and it ended up bent (though a day or two of putting it under some heavy books should fix it).

The video itself looks exactly of how I remembered it when I was younger. Colors aren't quite as saturated as expected and the quality of the video is a bit grainy like watching it on TV in the 90s.  I was actually expecting it to have been remastered but it wasn't. Maybe that was why it seemed so cheap? The new subtitles are a great addition to the DVD set. I haven't gotten a chance to look at the bonus features yet though.

The actual box is gorgeous and looks exactly how it is displayed on Amazon, however, the DVD cases not so much. They look like they were created by a novice with a basic DVD program and the images used are really low quality and look like they were taken by a camera phone, which is odd coming from such a beautiful box and honestly made me question if this product was authentic.

The menu screen has one bug that I noticed, but isn't bad overall. Although when I play the DVDs they're automatically set to subtitle, but you can also go to setup to quickly fix that if you're annoyed by the subtitles. The video quality is excellent with no flaws.

3620373,4,B001GU04Y0,"What can I say about The Powerpuff Girls? Its cult referecnes and hidden adult humor are among some of the greatest in cartoon history. From flying through the roofs and walls of buildings without anyone acknowledging the damage done to the redundant speech of Mojo Jojo, you will enjoy every last second of this complete series. Being a male, I cannot believe the media skewed this series as being suitable mostly for girls. Rubbish, I say! (By media, I speak mostly of the backpacks and clothes made only for girls when I was growing up.) There are extras aplenty and some lost episodes and specials, and a nice documentary. (Let us not forget the original ""Whupass Girls"" shorts.) Not to mention every single episode ever produced. The only thing missing is the movie, which I would assume comes with a COMPLETE series. Still, for such a great price, this is a nice investment. My only true complaints was the two episodes ""Ice Sore"" and ""Los Dos Mojos"" not working properly. These episodes skipped to the very end of the episode, so I could not watch all of them (although, most of ""Ice Sore"" played; it just skipped at the VERY END of the episode). Then again, this may have something to do with my Playstation 3 not playing the episodes properly. There were also some scratches on season 3's disk, but it did not cause any episodes to skip. Other than that, everything was perfect. In spite of each disk being double-sided and the so-called ""poster"" being separated in six pieces, this is worth the purchase, especially considering the price.

With the decline of cartoon quality, I am happy that I can someday show my children this great series. Cartoons have lost that special quality which made them great, and this purchase is the perfect chance to show our next generation what good cartoons once were.",1321228800,2,1813,4.737341772151899
3620374,4,B001GU04Y0,"I got this box set for my fourteenth birthday and it was well worth it! I'd watched the show as a five-year-old and it was nice to relive my childhood as a teenager. It was a little strange to have double-sided DVDs but it's still a good product.

Season 1: Of course, this season has some of the all-time best ones. I'm not crazy about ""The Rowdyruff Boys"" unlike most fans, but my favourites on here are ""Buttercrush"", ""Bubblevicious"", and ""Just Another Manic Mojo"". Especially the ending of the third. ""The day is saved, thanks to Mojo Jojo! You saved the day!""
""I did not!""
Extras: OK, nothing special, but we'll get to that later.

Season 2: Another one that has some of the best. Kudos for the first appearance of Princess! I think my favourites are ""Too Pooped To Puff"" with the townspeople's reaction with the monster and ""You Snooze You Lose"" with the Amoeba Boys finding Mojo's plan. Best line: ""So if we can get the monster to take a bath, his toast will get soggy!"" As usual, the characters are brilliant. It's also nice to see Blossom being imperfect when she steals in ""A Very Special Blossom"".
Extras: Brilliant! The show and tell with the girls is wonderful, especially Buttercup's rant about what she doesn't like. The commentaries are the best extras of all the discs, especially Mojo's at the end when all the normal girls beat him up. ""Turn it off! I, Mojo Jojo, command you to turn off this part, which I no longer find enjoyable!""

Season 3: Again, good episodes. Maybe not up to the standard of the last couple, but still good. My favourite is ""Meet The Beat-Alls"" as I grew up listening to the Beatles, and it's especially fun listening to hear the lines of the songs and other famous reference, such as ""screaming girls"" and ""I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group and hope we passed the audition.""
Extras: The music videos are a nice touch, especially the ""Supergirl"" one.

Season 4: Mostly full-length episodes instead of two at a time. Mostly they are very good. While ""Power-Noia"" is not very good, the premise was brilliant! I think my favourite is ""Him Diddle Riddle"", especially for it's EPIC ending. ""And so...um...yeah.""
Extras: ""Twas The Fight Before Christmas"" is nice to see, and I like the way they portray Santa, but it's not one of their best. It's basically the typical Christmassy cartoon.""

Season 5: A few good ones. Again the ending decides my favourite episode ""Pee Pee Gs"" when Mojo explains his motives after the girls challenge him. ""That's why you did it, Mojo, isn't it?""
""No. I just don't like you."" One of the best by-plays of Mojo and the girls ever.
Extras: Nothing special, again.

Season 6: Very nice. Best episode is probably ""Miss Interprets"" , but the ending is quite weak and the idea has been done before. The writers chose not to do a seventh season, even though they could have, for a reason.
Extras: 'The Powerpuff Girls Rule!' is pretty good, and the ending is amazing. The supermarket commercial is especially funny. ""Hey, braniac. Did you try the door?""

However, they did play very easily on my computer and she has been glued to the screen for many days watching it. She says, ""They are awesome"" (don't know where my granddaughter picked up that wretched epithet) ""and I am going to share the viewing experience with my friends at school"".

3620379,4,B001GU04Y0,"The show is good. I went into this boxset mostly blind, watching only ""Meet the Beat-Alls"" and the first two episodes of season one before deciding this series was for me. Thankfully, I was right for the most part. The creator, Craig McCracken, basically was not involved with the show for seasons 5 and 6. Those two seasons are the worst. Season 1 is very good; seasons 2 and 3 are fantastic. Four, though only slightly worse than one, is the start of a decline that becomes more pronounced in season 5 and even steeper for season 6. (Make no mistake: this isn't a quality decline on par with SpongeBob SquarePants post-season 3. The episodes are still high quality, most of the time.) Note that the first three seasons (and part of season 4?) are beautifully hand-drawn, while the rest are computer-made and distinctly lacking the 60s-era Hannah-Barbara charm.

Only once did I find an episode completely worthless. That episode was ""See Me, Feel Me, Gnomey"". That rock opera is far, far too badly written it to have any merit. ""Twas the Fight Before Christmas"" wasn't that good, either. Christmas-themed episodes of shows rarely are.

The most disappointing aspects of this set are the physical packaging of it and the setup of the DVDs. The packaging is both cheap and cumbersome. I would have much preferred cheap and compact. Instead of 6 DVDs in 6 cases, they could have been split into 3 multi-disc cases. This could have saved Cartoon Network a few cents and allowed them to print covers that don't look like garbage.

The DVDs play the theme song before every episode, even when ""play all"" is selected. If I'm watching 15 episodes in one sitting, I don't need 15 theme songs to go with it. A minor gripe, since they were considerate enough to mark each theme song and credits as its own chapter, allowing easy skipping. More annoying was that the 10th anniversary special, originally aired in 16:9, was presented letterboxed for 4:3 televisions. This creates ""windowboxing"" on 16:9 TVs and means that less detail is available to the viewer.

The subtitles seem to have been edited from the original closed captioning. They write the Gangrene Gang phonetically as the ""Gang Green"" Gang. The parts where I most want subtitles (when characters are speaking very quickly as a joke and you're not supposed to hear what they're saying, for example) are the parts that subtitles don't cover. These lines, if you can catch them, are often funny, so it's a shame that they aren't written down.

Warner Bros. still has yet to distribute The Powerpuff Girls Movie in widescreen in the USA. One can find the uncropped European version online, but not including it here is mind-boggling.",1313193600,3,2684,4.813449023861171
3620380,5,B001GU04Y0,"...can now feel safe thanks to the powerful, yet adorable, Powerpuff Girls on DVD!

The DVDs include sugar and spice and everything nice, but there is a secret ingredient -enough chemical X to keep the likes of giant monsters, Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins and even Him away from your home for long periods of time. True, the double sided DVDs and lack of inserts does upset a few good citizens, but I personally prefer to keep the price down.

My three girls love watching the DVDs -when they are not busy saving the world. When I first showed the program to my 4 year old, she looked into my eyes with a big grin on her face and said, ""thank you daddy."" The show helps her feel empowered. The girls also share experiences that other young children face including: bed wetting, security blankets and loosing teeth.

Citizens of all ages will enjoy the characters, wit and imaginative stories.

Once again the day is saved thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!

She loves this, and I have to admit that I enjoy watching as well.  This set has many episodes (Seasons 5 and 6) that are rarely if ever shown on Boomerang.  One is a 20-minute long music video that seemed very strange the first time we saw it, but is strangely addicting -- our entire family (9 year old son in addition to the 8-year old daughter, plus Mom and I) enjoy watching it so much that we all now nearly have it memorized.  The set is nicely packaged.  There are 78 episodes in all, plus a holiday special and some other extras.

Although the plots are as violent and gorey as any other superhero movie,  it teaches morality beyond the immoral.  One episode was about a giant cockroach devouring the city, and the Power Puff girls defeated the enormous insect.  The Narrator scientifically explained the existence and the purpose of the cockroach but he stomped the little bugger at the end of the lesson.

The monsters are grotesque and horribly ugly.  The violence is too entence for little girls under the age of 4 years of age.  I hope my grand daughter grows out of it though.

The Power Puff Girls triumph over bad and evil, conquoring the wrongdoing and promoting peace, love, goodness (after they kick some major butt).  OK its a bit violent but for the good of the cause.

3620408,3,B001GU04Y0,"I'm making this review based more on the actual packaging of this box set.

having the entire PPG episodes in one box is great but the production value of the DVD box set is so poor.  I don't want to sound racist, but on the back of my box it had a sticker on it saying it was made in Mexico, I'm not saying anything made in Mexico is gonna be of poor quality, but whatever company put this box set together did a horrid job.  The box that holds the DVDs is made from flimsy cardboard that comes apart easily, the DVD covers were obviously printed by some crappy inkjet printer because they are covered with pinstripes.  There are no DVD inserts, and most disappointing of all, no poster.  The disks themselves have no label on them, they are double sided so I guess you can't put a label on them? But you kind of have to keep the DVDs in their crappy boxes at all times to know which DVD is which.

Maybe over time WB decided to stop making good-quality copies of this boxset, or something, but at least I didn't have to pay too much for it.

So yeah, if you really want all the PPG episodes in one box well, I'd try and buy it used, so you are really just paying for the episodes, not the packaging of the box set.",1294963200,5,1216,4.105485232067511
3620409,5,B001GU04Y0,"Call me crazy, but I love this show, I saw it when it was brand new back in 1998. I loved it back then and still do today. In fact, despite the excessive violence which stirred up controversy, there is some educational evidence in here. In most of the episodes, the lesson is that crime does not pay. In another episode titled 'Curses' Bubbles learns a new word from the professor which she and her sisters start using and then use it outside of the home. This is similar to a Spongebob episode titled 'Sailor's Mouth'. In fact, Tom Kenny (who is best know today as nick's undersea hero)provides the voice for the Mayor, the wisecracking narrator who opens and closes each and every episode and Mitchel Mitchelson the school bully (among other characters). Aside from the education value I also enjoy the retro style animation and the characters (my all time favorite character is Bubbles).

But I would not purchase this item from Amazon.com. i would purchase from an Amazon marketplace store. Here's why:

The copy I received from Amazon did not have any inserts. No listing of the shows; no ""panoramic poster"" as the box claims (this is actually just the inserts taken out, turned over and set side-by-side), nothing. I returned the item and recieved a new set from Amazon. Twice. Not one of the 3 box sets had a single piece of paper in it. To Amazon's credit their customer service was amazing. They sent me a new box, paid for me to ship one back, did it again, and then refunded me the purchase price when i decided to return the third copy and order the set from another store. It was one of the Amazon market place stores. It had all of the inserts. Now I can figure out what episodes are on which DVDs! Amazing!",1291334400,13,1021,4.396825396825397

I do wish they would mass release this set as individual DVDs though. Our kids lost one of the DVDs and finding a replacement without buying a whole new boxed set took months of eBay searching.",1290297600,,527,4.489583333333333

3620423,4,B001GU04Y0,"I bought this directly from Amazon and I must say this is very good because you get to watch every episodes from season 1-6 though I have not finished watching it but still satisfied. However it would be better if it is not double sided disc because you have to be a little careful not to get scratches on either side. Some others say that you have difficulties telling the difference between side A and B because there are no signs - but that is wrong because once you open the disc case and take the disc out and place it in the dvd player directly like how you do with a normal single sided disc,(the blue label around the center hole facing up) you are playing side A. Basically the side with a blue label around the hole is side B, as well as other discs and it actually states what season each disc is - so totally not hard to guess.

The dvd lost a star because the quality of packaging - made of thin card and the cd case covers are not printed with high quality, which you can tell with the colour stripe lines you see (not smooth), which is like printed from an inkjet printer - printed normal/fast/everyday quality. Overall it is very good to own this if you want a complete series of the Powerpuff Girls and to watch every single episodes 'in order'. Unlike in TV, the episodes are shown random and you hardly can watch every episode and therefore you will see repeats of episodes. Definitely recommended especially if you buy it directly from amazon.com because good price (changes all the time - recommend price i would say is $30.99), good reputation, guaranteed that it is the original dvd and quite fast dispatch.",1285977600,,1630,4.415282392026578

They sat and watched the whole thing through without moving or asking for anything which if u have kids you know how amazing that is. So i guess you could say the Powerpuff Girls were reborn.

3620480,4,B001GU04Y0,"I watched Powerpuff Girls on cartoon network as a child with my father all the time as a child and we were both ecstatic when we found out about this set. The show is, unfortunately, not quite as good as I remember, but that's saying little. This is a great set for children who will enjoy countless hours of a great cartoon, or the occasional watch for an old fan like me. I do have a few complaints, though.

1. The box and labels. I'm a collector of many box sets of cartoons and Anime, and the quality of the presentation does not, in my opinion, match the price of the set. The box is made of thin, paper cardboard. At first it appeared to me that the DVD labels were printed on a cheap printer running out of ink, but thankfully this was just an unfortunate choice of design - although I would have appreciated more thoughtful covers as well, it can be forgiven since they're hidden in a box most of the time.
2. the double-sided disks. The sides aren't even labeled, and though it doesn't take a genius to figure out it's still not as intuitive as it should be. For a $50 last effort to make money on a nearly forgotten franchise they're already milked, I think they could have afforded to have 2 separate disks rather than dual sided ones.
3. The packaging advertises that this set comes with a poster of the various characters. Each piece of this 'poster' is printed on the back of the DVD insert papers, so if you want to hang it up you have to assemble the pieces together, and then you lose the only guide to which episodes are on each disk, as they are not printed on the back of the DVD cases.

For the most part, though, the pluses make up for the shortcomings:

1. Subtitles! I (and my increasingly hard at hearing father) greatly appreciate these as they aren't often included in sets like this. I haven't watched every episode, but I can't remember any errors in them.
2. There are tons of extras over these disks. It would have been very easy to make this a bare-bones release without any nice extras but they really came through in this area.

Overall my issues are mostly with the packaging and not the actual product itself. I think these shortcomings could have been better forgiven if the price wasn't quite as steep on this (Though, thanks to Amazon, you can get this a bit more reasonably priced than I did). If that's not a bother to you, or you're buying it for a child or just want it to watch the show again (as opposed to a collectors item) then this is a great purchase!",1243382400,4,2502,4.3283582089552235

3620482,5,B001GU04Y0,"to get if your looking for all things Powerpuff.  It has the complete series along with several extras and other goodies for those that have followed the series when it aired.  But even if you didn't the series as a whole will grab your attention after a few episodes.  Most of the episodes are back to back 15 minute episodes but every now and then.  You will find some single 30 minute episodes.

The characters themselves are pretty engaging with Blossom being the leader with her fiery personality and leadership qualities.  You also have Buttercup who's the resident tomboy, ruff and tough fighter that always wants to fight her way out of any situation.  Then there's Bubbles who has the outgoing, easy to love personality.  She loves playing and talking with the animals. Sometimes even bringing them home much to the Professor's dismay as it's detailed in an episode here.

The villians are funny to watch from Mojo to Him to the Ganggreen Gang, Fuzzy Lumpkins, Sedusa, Rowdyruff Boys (whom I enjoyed when they appeared), Princess (w/an ego and money big enough to buy the world). They are all entertaining and downright fun to watch at all times.  The series itself owns and along with the Mayor (who's more clueless than the game), Ms. Bellum (we never see her face unless i missed something).

How about instead of just cashing in on the TV show fans again, you hook up the movie fans with the original widescreen presentation of the movie. I'm thrilled you didn't crap out like Hill Street Blues did in releasing the whole series. Thank you, but widescreen DVD of the film so Warner Brothers animation fans can take you seriously again.",1235692800,,622,4.5625

Well, no, I'm not. And If you've ever seen this show, you would know that it is one of the funniest, smartest, action packed, and all around great cartoons of all time. Yeah, no exaggeration. When i was a lad watching Cartoon Network, this, Dexter's Lab, Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Scooby Doo Where Are You practically raised me. Shame none of those have a DVD set. But hey, pick your battles I guess. And The Powerpuff Girls is quite a victory in itself! Great show, great buy. Highly recommended.",1234310400,,672,4.299212598425197
3620499,5,B001GU04Y0,"I am so looking foreward to this.

The Powerpuff Girls has to be by far, the most popular series The Cartoon Network ever aired. It is still extremely popular today, due to it's overall creative writing, old school animation, and the extreme cuteness of it's three main characters, wich need no mention here.

Who would have thought that Craig Mc Cracken's short student film would have spawned two pilots, (Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins and Crime 101), six seasons worth of 7 minute shorts, one theatrical movie, and a Japanese Anime, let alone an entire fanfiction industry that continues to thrive.

The Powerpuff Girls is one of those rare tv shows that will never die, due to it's hardcore fans, and the new fans that will discover it down the road. The animation is far from Disneyesque, but it's sheer fun, pop culture status, and entertainment value will make it a fan favorite for decades to come.",1233964800,,896,4.767741935483871

So until that happens or they restore these for Bluray I am SO HAPPY with this purchase!
This series is still lough out loud hilarious and edge of your seat entertaining.
