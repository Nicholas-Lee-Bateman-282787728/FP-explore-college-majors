Whereas Derek Jacobi was sort of an effete, Eugene McCarthy kind of King, Tennant gives a very passionate performance, making Richard immature and, as things go against him, desperate.  I am looking forward to seeing this again on DVD.  Definately a worthwhile purchase.",1400025600,50,442,5.083333333333333

6330056,5,B00J379KKW,"This is a filmed version of the live play, and it's *wonderful*.

From a technical perspective: cameras were placed in the ceiling and all around the room, sometimes capturing the whole stage and giving us an audience member's perspective, at other times taking closeups and angles that would be impossible to see from the floor.  This disc also has a full-length director's commentary which includes discussions of how decisions were made for filming the live performance.

As to the story itself: this is a very, very accessible version of Richard II.  The language flows beautifully.  Characters are made complex; sympathy is shown for unlikeable ones, and deeper motivations are found for apparently-shallow ones.  Compare the deposition scene here (Act 4 Scene 1) with the BBC's ""Hollow Crown"" version and witness how two interpretations of the same story can be so different.  (Added bonus: this production kept the gage-throwing scene.  You'll be SO pleased they did.)

This is the first of the history plays that Gregory Doran is directing, filming, and live-screening.  I saw this production in a cinema, waited not-so-patiently for the DVD release, and will repeat the cycle with Henry IV (parts I and II) and the rest as they come.",1399939200,56,1242,5.103960396039604
6330057,5,B00J379KKW,"This is a brilliant & extraordinary film of a live performance at Stratford - upon - Avon, the home of the RSC. If you are a David Tennant Fan, you will want this DVD. If you are a Shakespeare fan, you will want this DVD. David Tennant is brilliant as Richard II. A man whose vanity threatens to divide the great houses of England and drag his people into a civil  war that will last 100 years. He takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. David takes you from dislike of Richard, to laughter, to pity. The remaining actors in this assemble are the cream of Shakespeare actors in British society today. Nigel Lindsay as Bolingbroke is wonderful. Michael Pennington, Oliver  Ford Davies, and Jane Lapotaire are amazing. They breath new life into a 400 year old play, with modern day implications of regime change in many parts of the world. The characters in this play are very complicated, but Gregory Doran's production makes you think about their hidden agendas. The staging, backdrops, music, and lighting of this play are first rate. This production makes you feel like you are right their in the audience at Stratford. I bought this DVD from AmazonUK.com. and I am very happy with it.",1399766400,41,1195,4.632075471698113

6330065,4,B00J379KKW,"I give 4 stars because of David Tennant. Of all the Richard II actors, for me David Tennant plays the character superbly with a great blend of mood swings, lyrical drama in the king's soul, and gradual transformation. HOWEVER, there has been considerable license taken with the play itself, particularly in the last third - so much so that it alters the play too much, down to different characters doing certain critical things. It is natural that some lines are culled (not to the horrifying extent of THE HOLLOW CROWN production), but that actual acting changes in the  last part of Act V are just too much and shouldn't happen. One essential short scene in the last act is totally omitted! The truest production that I have seen on tape or DVD is the one with the equally magnificent Sir Derek Jacobi as Richard II, from the BBC 1978 version with John Gielgud. This is the one to see, if you love Richard II the play. Yet I still give this one I'm reviewing 4 stars because of David Tennant as well as the other actors. Oliver Ford Davies is marvelous. The alterations and inserted themes are the rub. Richard II is so lyrical and thought-provoking that it may be my favorite of all the plays.",1441584000,,1196,4.537037037037037

6330088,1,B00J379KKW,"Watching Rupert Goold's film of Richard II (2012), featuring Ben Whishaw in the title role, I was initially intrigued and then swiftly dismayed by Whishaw's cinematic inwardness.  Richard is frankly despicable in his early scenes, but he can ultimately win over the audience through the extremity of his suffering, the flight of his poetry and the prophetic intensity of his insights.  Unfortunately, Whishaw conveys nothing but increasing introversion and remoteness, and so remains loathsome throughout.  (His closest relationship is with his pet monkey).  At Wales, he climbs a sand dune to deliver his speeches, hoping that physical elevation will lift him to the heights that his passion cannot reach.  He remains abstracted and withdrawn at Flint Castle, where his Richard is so intent on producing an effect that he seems to feel nothing but stage-jitters.  His colloquies with Aumerle are like whispered conversations in the wings on the order of ""How am I doing?""  This may be an interpretive choice; it is also an evasion of the central challenge.  If Whishaws were horses, Ben would be a hack.

David Tennant's Richard for the RSC (2013) is equally inadequate in a different mode.  During an interview shown before the play, director Gregory Doran declares that ""Whatever David does, he is absolutely contemporary!""  If by that he means ""incapable of dealing with heightened language and profound emotion,"" he is correct.  Unlike Whishaw with his ever-receding solipsism, Tennant tries to supply these deficiencies with his trademark cheeky humor.  As a result, he is the funniest Richard I have ever seen (even funnier than Fiona Shaw), but I think that the play is meant to be a tragedy.

Why should an audience care about a Richard as aloof, callow, trifling and ordinary as Tennant's or Whishaw's?  In possible awareness of this problem, Doran and Goold resort to the exact same device to generate a measure of belated sympathy.  Flouting Shakespeare and Holinshed, they have Richard assassinated by Aumerle instead of Exton, and they further present Aumerle as Richard's actual or would-be lover.  In order to wipe out the taint of his abortive treason, Aumerle (we are to understand) destroys the thing he loves at the real or imagined behest of the incorrigibly heterosexual Bolingbroke.

In short, both directors portray Richard as a martyr to homophobia, something that Marlowe's Edward so obviously is, but that Shakespeare's Richard so obviously is not.  Goold drives home the point with sledgehammer subtlety by depicting Richard as the most famous of all gay icons:  stripped to a loincloth, he is shot to death with arrows.  Doran does nothing quite so blatant, but he does have Richard and Aumerle share a lingering kiss, and he directs Tennant to be distant and unloving towards his Queen.  His farewell kiss to her in their final scene is perfunctory, and when she responds with a more ardent kiss, he does not reciprocate.

Thus, Richard meets his doom in both productions implicitly proclaiming ""I am Edward II, know ye not that?""  The audience is meant to think of gay-bashing and wipe away a tear.  But there may be some who feel that the countertextual triggering of irrelevant responses does not make up for actors who are ""absolutely contemporary"" and therefore unable to cope with classical magnitude and pathos.  And there may be some who are more moved by the plight of Richard's Queen than by the factitious vagaries of his liaison with Aumerle, a relationship with no more tragic grandeur than Oscar and Bosie's.",1409702400,19,3552,5.0810344827586205

6330090,5,B00J379KKW,"This is the definitive Richard II for our time--a live performance at the Royal Shakespeare Company's main stage in Stratford-Upon-Avon, with a superb cast, imaginative use of the stage, and fine direction.  David Tennant has the exact kind of nervous energy to play Richard--assuming his right to absolute power and yet uncomfortable with the roles he must play, offhandedly poetical with those he would banish, blind to his own excesses with his parasites, and to the effects his actions against the Duke of Gaunt and his son Bolingbroke will have with the other lords.  Two great surprises, beyond Tennant's great performance:  the great Michael Pennington returns to the RSC as the Duke of Gaunt and plays his role with all the majesty and pathos of a Gielgud, and another stalwart, Jane Lapotaire, is on board as the Duchess of Gloucester, a woman whose husband has been murdered by Richard's thugs, and who plays her brief role with all the anguish and rage of a woman who can see a former glory being smothered and bids Gaunt farewell in a groan of despair.  Director Gregory Doran is to be commended for properly capturing Richard's arc from presumptuous young king to a man who cannot face what is happening to him, at last rising to a kind of heroic status as he confronts his death.

Stunning, nuanced performance by David Tennant as the complex king who collapses under the weight of ambition, betrayal, circumstance, and bad advice. Beautifully spare staging provides just enough context for the story without getting in the way of the characters or the language.

6330106,5,B00J379KKW,"I was really looking forward to this production coming out. After the BBC's production in the Hollow Crown series a few years ago, there was a lot to live up to. Tennant didn't disappoint. The staging in this production is fantastic, and the camera direction makes the viewer feel as though he is in the audience. The production did a particularly good job with its portrayal of the relationship between Richard and Aumerle. Although it took the same approach as the Hollow Crown and had Aumerle murder Richard instead of Exton (something that creates a bit of a problem since Exton is supposed to be exiled, yet Aumerle appears in later plays as Rutledge), the portrayal of the murder in this version was exponentially better, and the conflict and love between the two cousins was palpable.

8647653,3,B00J379KKW,"Let me start this review of Richard II at the Globe with a brief background that may help to grasp the meaning of the play. Shakespeares History Plays illustrate the seven stages of the transformation process of the being of England. Each stage is symbolically represented by one of the seven English kings, i.e., King John, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI, Richard III, and Henry VIII. Historically, the process was initiated by the formation of the Order of the Garter by King Edward III. The members of the Order of the Garter were divided into two circles of thirteen each, one under Edward III and the other under his eldest son, the Black Prince. The underlying purpose of the Order was to preserve techniques and practices allowing certain individuals to develop capacities transcending the limitations of the ordinary mind and gaining access to supracognitive power. In other words, the History Plays are an illustration of the process of the development of true Kinghood.
In the play, John Gaunt, the Duke of York, and the recently murdered Duke of Gloucester - are Edward IIIs sons. King Richard II is the son of the Black Prince (Richard II was the first among the kings of England who was initiated into the Order of the Garter). According to Shakespeares presentation, a true King could be developed only in the presence of love. In this context, ordinary, i.e., sensual, familial, or social affection is only a remote echo of the transcending force of love. The main challenge of the process is the fact that anyone who tries to graft developmental practices upon an unregenerate personality will end up with an aberration. This means that one has first to experience the state of being nothing before a constructive transformation may take place. It is with such a challenge that King Richard II is faced in the course of the play. An impulse of true love is symbolically represented by Queen Isabel. Richards unregenerate personality is manifested by his preoccupation with his pet project in Ireland and his attractions to other worldly indulgences. Shakespeare presented the working of these two opposing forces as Isabels unconditional devotion to Richard and Richards faint but unmistakable homosexuality. The play illustrates the difficulties that Richard II is having as his attachments to worldly pleasures gradually draw him away from Isabel. Only at the end of the play, Richard experiences a moment of realization of his true condition (nor I, nor any man that but man is, with nothing shall be pleasd, till he be easd with being nothing.) At this time, however, it is too late. He has already been separated permanently from Isabel. There is no remedy. His entire potential has been lost. He has to die. So, the essence of the play is displayed by Richards struggles with these two opposing forces, his gradual realization of his true state, and his ultimate failure. We may notice that the withdrawal of Isabel influenced the remaining episodes of the History Plays. All the English Kings in the following episodes will be hopelessly struggling with the realization of their kinghood. Shakespeare indicates that the English royal branch became developmentally sterile. The only remedy for the sustaining of the process in England was to transfer the developmental techniques from the royals onto selected individuals recruited from the middle and lower classes. Shakespeare described this transfer in The Merry Wives of Windsor.
Now lets take a look at how Simon Godwin, the director of the Globes production, has approached the play. Usually the Globes productions are faithful to the original text. So I was somehow surprised that Godwin managed to modify quite drastically the original plot of the play. He did it in a very clever way. He used a dazzling coronation ceremony and a small wooden toy as his Trojan horse to divert the attention of the audience from a dramaturgical crime. It was quite effective. None of the critic writings for the major English newspapers noticed that Godwin replaced Extons servant with Aumerle. The attention of the audience in the final act was effectively diverted from Richards transformation onto Aumerle, a rather cowardly and dandy character of the play. In this way, the balance and symmetry of the play was disturbed and the entire impact was reduced into some sort of a trivial melodrama. It should be noted that the same change, but in a much clumsier way, was previously introduced by Gregory Doran in the 2013 production of Richard II at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford. Doran justified the change as it was a coincidence that seemed to work for us but happened to not occur to Shakespeare. It seems that the upper echelons of Shakespearean theatre in England have decided that now it is their duty to improve the Bards original plots. May they be unsuccessful!",1493769600,5,4857,4.990135635018496
8647654,5,B00J379KKW,"This video of Gregory Doran's recent RSC production took my breath away.  This might be my favorite David Tennant performance to date, including his lovely turn as The Doctor.  There are dozens of reviews appropriately commending his superb performance.  Doran's other choices are equally brilliant.  Richard II and the subsequent plays in the cycle are about people rising and falling, and Doran's staging gives us wonderful visual ascents and descents to match the emotion in the play.  Richard II is also a play about old people giving way to younger people, and the older characters are portrayed with more compassion than I recall seeing in any other production.  The hardest questions in the play, such as whether Bolingbroke is a grasping fiend or a man pressed to extremes, is left to the audience to decide.  This performance is one for the ages.",1489104000,2,855,4.97887323943662
8647655,4,B00J379KKW,"Tennant's talent for humor is evident here, almost as much as in his Benedick in Much Ado or his Hamlet.  His long lovely locks accent the image of the moody, fickle king as interested in himself far more than his kingdom.  This version is more than a star turn for Dr. Who fans - worth watching.",1480118400,,296,4.267857142857143
8647656,5,B00J379KKW,"As usual, Globe delivers a clear, enjoyable production.  The usually bare Globe stage is transformed with a uniformly golden patina.  The opening reminds us that Richard was only a child when he assumed the throne, and the ending returns to that opening image with one telling detail.  The act one conflict between Bolingbroke and Mowbray is surprising only in that Mowbray's actor is strong and striking and would make a fine Henry 4.",1480118400,3,435,4.931506849315069

Gratitude for such artistry and guts! I am really very glad I can view it again and again.
Thankyou!",1475712000,,173,4.9655172413793105

Great work by David Tennant-- glowing ,vocal lyricism and great psychological depth of a King who gradually looses his kingdom and descends into a hollow vacuum of eternal nihilism..Superb camera work.",1463443200,,282,5.738095238095238
