6992786,3,B00SU4PG3O,"This movie looked so promising ! At the start, it looked like it was going to be edge of the seat kind of movie. The acting crew was good. As mentioned, the beginning of the movie was promising. The sad part of the movie is that it started to drag. It slowed down so bad, that it could not recuperate from the doldrums. A potentially nice movie that lacked the pizzazz. The punch. I'm speculating that it ran out of funds ... maybe ? Whatever it was, it started out great, but ran out of gas, and lost my attention. Maybe part 2 ? I really hope so. 3 stars is the highest I could give, and I am being very generous.",1428019200,7,615,4.049180327868853
6992787,2,B00SU4PG3O,"A man is part of a bloodline that has been hunted by a demonic race of beings born of fire. Now he is at a crossroads, let them end his bloodline forever, or find a way to destroy them. Wishmaster. So much better. This piece of crap has a lot of issues so lets just get to it. The acting. Quite bad on many occasions. The story, as redundant as they come. Now, using Djinn, or Jinn, whichever spelling you prefer, is not an overused idea in horror, only about a handful of movies have. But still, there was no good story to back up the idea. The Jinn themselves look pretty good, I will say that. The funniest thing about this movie is that it is so incredibly cheesy but it takes itself so seriously. Theres a really long slow motion sequence that just had me in stitches. The direction is pretty awful too, just as plodding as it can get. Pretty awful. 1.5/5",1426291200,10,860,4.218181818181818
6992788,2,B00SU4PG3O,"The whole idea of the movie is cool. Angels from light, humans from clay & the Jinn from fire. It could have been a really good movie, but unfortunately they just didn't execute it right. We are left with a dragging story line with poor acting & quite a few loop holes oh & an obvious low budget. I have seen a ton of short films by amateurs that looked far more professional & appealing. The best part of the movie by far is the ""Firebreather"" car....a modified 5th gen Camaro made to look like a Firebird and even at that it was only shown in one scene. If the movie was actually good and the car (which they probably spent most of the budget on) was featured more it would have really given GM a wakeup call to bring Pontiac back. Instead the movie was advertised awhile before it was to come out then must have bombed so bad you didn't even hear about it anymore after that (who knows if it ever made it into theatres).",1456876800,2,923,4.191011235955056

6992790,4,B00SU4PG3O,Great movie. This is one that flew under the radar. The plot is great and the actors pull you into the story. The special effects are good and there are some great twists. Good movie for the price.,1454803200,,197,4.2105263157894735
6992791,3,B00SU4PG3O,"Disappointing.
The previews make this movie look better than it is.
Still worth a rent but beware.
Overall a so-so movie.",1453766400,,121,4.809523809523809
6992792,4,B00SU4PG3O,"Even after watching a trailer, I wasn't certain what the plot of this film was. But Ray Park had a leading role in it, so I had to check it out. He is normally hired for his martial art skills, so usually he doesnt have a speaking role. I was delighted that he actually did have dialogue in this movie! Love his accent.
The movie itselftotal eyesore. The effects were vintage, the story was about as unoriginal as they come, although some aspects were unpredictable because they were just so strange. Apparently the best tactic for an all powerful monster to utilize while killing youis grabbing your shoulders and pushing you against a wall. Its a great movie to sit down with and watch with a bunch of friendsand make fun of. You know how Sharknado is so bad its good? This movie is close to that. Its a horror that comes off as a joke and if you make your own entertainment while watching it, youll have a good time.",1451260800,2,919,4.380116959064328
6992793,5,B00SU4PG3O,"I loved the Cinema release of the film JINN. I could never understand why films with any degree of intelligence so often bomb in the US. I was in Tallahassee when the film came out on very limited release. I do mean limited. AMC had it in one theatre, that's all, in Tallahassee. I don't know how it was in other cities. It is an excellent Supernatural Horror film, and in my opinion that's why it gets the low scores. The great production, Cool car ( The FireBreather car which was really built, supposedly about 10 or so), and care with the mythology showed this up as being a very good film. The German Blu-Ray is very good for the price, except that the titles at 3 key points are in German when you switch the settings to English 5.1, great sound too. The extras, such as they are, are also in German ( although I must admit that the Pre-view for the SCRIBBLER looks kind of intriguing, even though it was entirely in German, so I have no idea what they were talking about).",1449446400,2,979,4.297297297297297
6992794,5,B00SU4PG3O,"Was not out at the theaters, but this was one heck of a movie.  I loved this, and it explains what a Jinn is and what Middle Eastern and India and Pakistan believe in.  thoroughly love this.",1448236800,2,190,4.108108108108108

6992800,4,B00SU4PG3O,"There's a lot to love in the production of this film, but the story starts to sputter out as it gets to the end. I'm giving it a generous four stars because it was fairly original and was not at all cheap looking. On the down side, it runs out of places to go once the hero has passed ""a test"" showing he is the one meant to tackle the Jinn.",1443398400,3,341,3.816901408450704
6992801,4,B00SU4PG3O,"I give this movie 4 stars, because the people who put this movie together has to have some foundation of religious Knowledge .
This movie specifys on alot of true events.
A reality that some people may not be able to deal with.
No saying every think that happen was on point.
Alot of things were, look at the language inside his car l coud read some of it.
All I am saying  GREAT movie.

The staging was good. The special effects were great. The storyline was believable if you have any kind of imagination. It's something I can watch with my 12 year old son without any fear of being embarrassed. I really liked the ending, too. I watched this on Netflix. I did not know it was available on Prime until I tried to find the soundtrack.",1432425600,,523,4.402061855670103

6992812,3,B00SU4PG3O,"I've watched far worse than this.  Jinn definitely had promise.  There was a big element of the television series Supernatural in it.  I did like that while set in the US, this story had origins in the East, India to be precise.

Shawn comes from a line of chosen/cursed people.  Only people in his direct lineage have the ability to stop the Jinn, one of three original races from exterminating mankind to become the top of the foodchain yet again.  Shawn is assisted by Gabriel (Ray Park) and priest, Father Westhoff (William Atherton) and eventually Uncle Ali (Faran Tahir).

Honestly, I felt the two best performances came from veteran actors Atherton and Tahir.  Park's character was the surprise character, one per movie, you know.  All in all there are far worse ways to spend an evening.  Some night when you're too lazy to get up, pop a bag of Orville's and turn on the sound bar.",1432080000,6,889,4.641025641025641
6992813,4,B00SU4PG3O,"I'd give it almost 4.5 stars. I can't believe the negative reviews. And it gets worse elsewhere online. This was a great, scary movie with a lot of action and good SFX, and I watch this kind of movie a lot. It did seem to me to be short of cast in some places, other than at the mental hospital, when a dozen or more ""possessed"" patients went on a rampage. But other than this minor ""fault"" I thought it was excellent, and the Writer, Director, Designer, Editor, Art Director: Ajmal Zaheer Ahmad, is simply amazing. The chief protagonist is a video game designer, and the film starts with him at a drafting table, with concept drawings lying about. I believe these too were craeted by Mr. Ahmad. I think he is a giant talent, who has made a very fine movie.",1431648000,,757,4.338028169014085

6992815,2,B00SU4PG3O,"PLOT SPOILERS?

The DVD cover explains the film. There are three races. Clay people, who are us. Then there are light people or angels which we don't see, but may be there. And then there are the Jinn who are fire people. They ruled the earth before the vulgar clay people took over and some of them want it back, while others like Darth Maul will help us.

Shawn (Dominic Rains) is part of a cursed line of a Jinn killing all the offspring in the line, but only once another child is born, then it kills the father. Shawn is married to Jasmine ( Serinda Swan) who is barren and can't have children, but is pregnant. Where have we seen this before?

The film has overt religious connections, but makes religion rather universal. A sword with a Hebrew symbol in the hilt is used against the Jinn. Also a glass container with blue liquid which looks like  ""Angel for Men"" makes the Jinn angry when you smash it on their head.

The Jinn have all kinds of magical and supernatural powers and can kill us with a wink of an eye, but play by Hollywood rules.

Guide: Very mild swearing. No sex or nudity. Satan could use a bath and a haircut. Walmart $9.76 US",1429488000,5,1152,4.310185185185185
6992816,2,B00SU4PG3O,"This movie had great promise in the beginning, because of the acting and plot. However, as it began to drag on in a nearly forever manner, I was weary of the fighting and the constant guessing that became too complicated. Mankind, the first race, then angels, and then the jinn, who are now making vast appearances to take over and destroy humans. I watched this movie On Demand, and am glad I didn't pay for the CD.",1428624000,9,416,4.415584415584416

8699293,4,B00SU4PG3O,"At first I wasn't sure I would like this, but later I found myself tensing up with the suspense and action, so there must have been something there. Even though I felt like it was a watered down version of a very good book (I don't know if there is a book), it was still quite decent in a realm where originality, and good Sci-Fi/Fantasy, are sorely lacking in the movies. At least on Amazon Prime. So thumbs up to all who brought this movie to life.",1534032000,,450,4.183908045977011

Movie gives a good understanding of some of the spiritual forces that are at work on the physical plane and hints at the unification of the Abrahamic religions is the key to defeating the dark forces. As a practicing spiritual therapist it is easy for me to be a harsh critic. But for the beginner and someone who is just learning about the unseen forces.

8699297,5,B00SU4PG3O,"First of all! Never, Ever! write a review about any movie that you don't watch from the very beginning till the end, due to being occupied by doing a couple of different things at the same time, well....sad, but it happens.
That is how we get all these underappreciated good movies, because we miss a lot of good scenes or dialogs from the start and the whole plot just falls apart.
""Jinn"" is very entertaining movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for more. I've got seriously spooked a couple of times, when I wasn't even expecting. Unpredictable turns of action, hold the attention till the very end. The Jinn's character is very real, great the whole crew of actors, they play their roles great, very convincing.
I felt through the whole movie like suspended between two different time dimesions/worlds.
I wish I could have time capsule, so I could have navigate from the demons far away, seriously, I watched my back, while sitting on that sofa in the darkness of my living room  lol (true)
I want watch that movie again, and there is just a very few, which I can watch more than just once.
Fear, suspense, mystery and surprising moments - this movie has it all.
It makes you to pay attention to every scene/detail....lot of things...dark ones had happened....do not watch Alone (!)",1492128000,,1303,4.640692640692641
