7793884,5,0966408160,"As an Adult Nurse Practitioner and Certified Diabetes Educator working exclusively with people who have diabetes, I was quite interested in this DVD offering. After having investigated some of the research on plant based diets, including studies done by Dr. Barnard's organization (Physicians Committe for Responsible Medicine) presented at an American Diabetes Associaion annual Scientific Sessions a few years ago, I decided I needed to try it myself. I did that about 2 1/2 yrs ago, and I haven't looked back. Despite this higher carb diet (which is lower in glycemic index since it consists of whole grains, fruits, vegetables and beans), I personally have seen lower blood sugar levels (which I watch, preventatively, due to a family history of diabetes), an easier time maintaining weight and a wealth of other pleasant side effects. This DVD gives a lot of useful information, and I have shared it with a number of my patients. For those who have adopted it fully, I tend to see a significant change in weight, decreased need for insulin or other diabetes meds, and the recurring statement ""I'm more satisfied with food than I've ever been!"" I concur!

I found the grocery store tours very helpful, and have shared a portion of it with a weight loss group I run. I heartily recommend this DVD as a way to explore lots of new information a little at a time, with very helpful cooking and shopping tips. Spread the word!",1266451200,10,1425,4.864197530864198
7793885,5,0966408160,"Another terrific book by Dr Barnard. His way of explaining complicated info about diet/nutrition/medical issues makes it easy to understand how it all works. He is a dedicated person to the health and welfare of both humans and our furry and feathered non-humans. I do not have diabetes but love to share the virtues of a vegan diet to those that do and often recommend this book. I also highly recommend the DVD on the same subject. The recipes in the book are simple and great as well as the cooking demo's on the DVD. Keep up the great work, Dr Barnard!",1258070400,7,556,4.46078431372549
7793886,5,0966408160,"A New Approach to Nutrition for Diabetes by Dr. Neal Barnard provides groundbreaking information and new hope for anyone who wants to reverse type 2 diabetes or prevent its onset. The finding that a buildup of tiny bits of fat within muscle cells can interfere with insulin's ability to allow glucose to enter each cells membrane has critical implications.

  Dr. Barnard's program has produced amazing results using a powerful dietary approach to take advantage of this finding to repair insulin function.  Rather than just managing diabetes this program can actually help turn the disease around. The program essentially has three guidelines:  do not eat animal products, keep vegetable oils to a minimum, and favor foods with a low glycemic index. Through a series of lectures Dr. Barnard clearly explains how the program works and he makes the implementation of the guidelines easy to accomplish.

  In addition, Chef Toni Fiore demonstrates how to prepare quick and easy recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without counting calories or restricting portions. Each recipe is on the DVD with nutrition information, as well as directions to printable recipe cards at the PCRM.org website.

  A grocery store tour by two diabetes experts provides help shopping for the variety of foods necessary to succeed with this program. The tips given are useful and simple to follow.

  Inspirational success stories by four individuals who have used the program to reverse or greatly improve their diabetes show what is possible. Additional success stories as well as other diabetes resources are available at PCRM.org.

  Since type 2 diabetes is common in my family, I intend to share this DVD with other members. I am hopeful that they will adopt the program and do what is required to prevent or reverse diabetes in their lives. So far, I have been successful using this program to prevent the onset of diabetes.

  In addition to the DVD, I strongly recommend purchasing the book entitled Dr. Neal Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes. The book is able to provide a greater depth of information than is possible with a DVD, plus it includes additional menus and recipes by Bryanna Clark Grogan. These materials are excellent and can be life saving for anyone willing to make the changes necessary to prevent or reverse type 2 diabetes. This program can also be exceptionally effective for preventing complications for those with type 1 diabetes.",1234915200,21,2450,5.123425692695214
