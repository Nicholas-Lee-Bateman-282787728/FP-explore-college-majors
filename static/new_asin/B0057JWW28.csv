8470862,5,B0057JWW28,"The Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne, currently touring the USA and now in the Los Angeles area, is proving that there is far more to the string quartet repertoire than we are used to hearing. 'Avant-garde' barely describes the chances these four young men take in embracing the entire field of music, from their award winning CD of the quartets of Debussy, Ravel and Faur&eacute; and another all Haydn CD to this collection of creative works that take a bow to Hollywood. Classically trained, they have studied extensively with the Ysaye Quartet in Paris as well as with the eminent G&aacute;bor Tak&aacute;cs, Eberhard Feltz and Gy&ouml;rgy Kurt&aacute;g. Their performing standards are high and they are highly regarded for their subtle phrasing and sweeping passion. But they don't stop there. This recording, titled FICTION, has the quartet entering the repertoire of pop and jazz: they can be seen performing on YouTube where it is obvious that using contemporary sound techniques such as attaching mini-microphones to their instruments to give that 'electric sound'.

The works recorded here are adaptations of the music of Hollywood greats such as Charlie Chaplin, Bruce Springsteen, Chick Corea, Harold Arlen, Wayne Shorter, Lennon & McCartney, Brad Mehldau and Nicholas Roubanis. But the selection of songs doesn't explain the raison d'etre for this recording. The members of the quartet have invited guests to join in their interpretations of these songs. The violist Mathieu Herzog sings the 'The Streets of Philadelphia' (rather well, too!) with drummer Richard H&eacute;ry adding the flavor of the movie original. Richard H&eacute;ry joins the groups on almost every track on this CD making the quartet sound like a jazz ensemble rather than a like a classical string quartet. And there are more 'guests' who round out this fascinating concert. The brilliant French actress Fanny Ardant is the vocalist on 'Lilac Wine', Luz Casal brings her inimitable Spanish Pop sound to 'Amado M&iacute;o', 'Corcovado' is made particularly sensuous by American singer Stacey Kent, and even the highly regarded French opera star Natalie Dessay joins the quartet in a beautiful rendition of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' All four of the quartet members open their version of 'Someday My Prince Will Come' (en francais, 'Un Jour Mon Prince Viendra') a cappella before moving into the instrumental aspect of that arrangement.

Some of the tracks the quartet stands alone while in most of them they are joined by the drummer Richard H&eacute;ry creating a strange but fine ensemble. There will be some classical aficiondos who find this exploration outside their taste, and that is unfortunate. To find a string quartet with this degree of technical finesse, intelligence, charisma, and musicality - all wiling to try new territory - then perhaps this is a breakthrough for classical music. It does seem odd that while Los Angeles is celebrating the broad and important multi-discipline art survey, Pacific Standard Time, that this recital is not scheduled to be repeated. Instead Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne is offering two concerts that feature Mozart/Brahms/Borodin (with an encore from this album) and Martinu/Debussy/Schoenberg. Opportunities missed!
