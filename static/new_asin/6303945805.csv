Westerns, or Cowboy Movies, were popular in the 1930s and 1940s (or earlier). They usually told of the conflict between the cattle barons (large corporate ranches) and small ranchers or homesteaders (small farmers). These conflicts were based on historical facts (which are censored from most school books). They became less popular with the rise of the Private Investigator stories in the 1940s and 1950. The search for a missing person is comparable to finding missing cattle. Here are their condensed reviews.

Rage at Dawn 1955
This color movie is the true story of the Reno Gang from southern Indiana. Their looting, killing, and burning was similar to Quantrills Raiders. The Pinkerton Agency sent an undercover agent to get information. He pretends to be a train robber to get their trust and set a trap. The Reno brothers are caught and receive a severe punishment.

Vengeance Valley 1951
This color movie is about cattle ranching where Herefords are raised for meat. Missing cattle are traced to another ranch. There is a fight, then a plot to profit from a roundup of cattle on the range where they will be taken to market. There is the usual personal conflicts among people. Will the conflict be settled peacefully?",1396224000,,1259,4.957345971563981
