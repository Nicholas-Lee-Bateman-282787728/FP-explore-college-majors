1195703,5,B000006GEO,"Mmmm. . .Should Lesley Ann Warren risk a lifetime commitment for a few blissful hours with Chris Atkins? Oh, sure she should!!! Actually, this is a sweet, romantic story about two people who, beyond their strong mutual attraction, seem to genuinely like and find comfort in one another's company. The dance scenes are fun, the plot contains strong elements of humor and sensuality, and the leads turn in some engaging performances.
Good movie, especially for the ladies.",999302400,9,470,5.116883116883117

Her sister drags her to a male strip-club for a girls-night out, where she discovers that one of the dancers is her failing student Rick Monroe(Chris Atkins), a.k.a. ""Ricky the Rocket"".

A heated affair between teacher & student ensues, as Faye struggles to reconcile her emotions and make consequential life choices: Continue her lustful sessions with the studly- but-shallow teen stripper? Or break it off with Ricky & work to salvage her marriage to the loving-but- distant husband?

This drama flick takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1983.",1394150400,,781,5.046511627906977

A Night in Heaven (1983) **
D: John G. Avildsen
C: Christopher Atkins, Lesley Ann Warren, Robert Logan, Deney Terrio, Deborah Rush, Sandra Beall, Alix Elias, Carrie Snodgress, Andy Garca
P: A teacher (Warren), bored with her marriage, has a one night stand with one of her students (Atkins) after discovering that he is moonlighting as a stripper.

Sometimes in order to fully understand a movie, you got to understand the film's history. In 1983, teen films were dominating the market. The film My Tutor, about a French teacher who sleeps with one of her students, was released to great commercial success in March of 1983.

On the surface, A Night in Heaven looks like it has all the right ingredients - a cast of considerable talent, a screenplay by Joan Tewkesbury of Nashville fame and director John G. Avildsen (Rocky, The Karate Kid, Save the Tiger) at the helm.

Watching the film, it seems that the people behind it wanted to make a thoughtful examination into various relationships and how each of those relationships affect one another. However, judging from the film's brief running time and a noticeable absence of key scenes, it seems as though someone at 20th Century Fox got cold feet and had the film hastily re-edited at the last minute in order to make it something more marketable along the lines of My Tutor.

The final product plays up more to the film's erotic elements and the soundtrack. The marketing tried to make it seem like a cross between My Tutor and Saturday Night Fever.

Judging the film in front of me, Lesley Ann Warren turns in a fine performance. The scene in which Warren discovers that Christopher Atkins is moonlighting as the star attraction at a strip club is erotically effective. There are a few sincere moments that come across here and there and the film poses a lot of intriguing notions involving love, fidelity, class conflict, materialism, statements on war, alcoholism and notions involving its a dog eat dog world out there.

There's an interesting juxtaposition involving Atkins who sells his body and, in the process, his soul for money. On the other hand, Warren's husband (played by Robert Logan) quits his job as a prominent engineer, because he doesn't want to help in the production of missiles that could possibly become instruments of war. At the end of the day, he has to be able to look at himself in the mirror.

Atkins, who tried to branch out and do something different, stars as a college student stuck living in a trailer park with his mom. He doesn't want to end up like her, working a dead end job as a waitress at a small town coffee shop. So he uses the one thing he's got, his body, to use anyone and everyone that can help him escape his troubling predicament. In a cruel twist of fate, in which art imitated life, Atkins was used strictly just for his body. Any depth or character development involving his role was left on the editing room floor.

A Night in Heaven asks a lot of questions about humanity and our existence in the world, but most of those questions are left unanswered. Large chunks of the film appear missing. I can easily imagine that this is not the film that the people behind this film intended to make. Sex plays a role in this film, as it does in any adult's life. Whoever edited the final product and/or the suits who were in charge of the film's marketing, couldn't see past the sex. Who knows how this film would have turned out if the people behind it had been allowed to present their initial vision of this film, but I can't imagine it being any worse then the film in front of me. Whether the film had been a hit or a flop in its original form, whether it had been a hit with critics or not, at least it would have been more representative of what everyone set out to initially accomplish.

1195731,3,B000006GEO,"For those who remember the stir caused by The Blue Lagoon, this video is an adult follow up, at least in terms of the Chris Atkins acting career which in hindsight proved mercifully short. It's not a bad video, however. In some ways it is quite decently done and gives an interesting little glimmer into a lost time. On that level it is enjoyable. The handling of the married woman's faltering marriage is another plus. The dance scenes are quite decent and in my view nicely avoided becoming offensive. If you want a short trip back in time this video will give it. I can't rave about it, but I can't complain either.",1309996800,6,618,4.477876106194691

Chris is astounding in this film---HOT, HOT, HOT, and all kinds of naked.  The intense chemistry between Chris and Lesley Ann Warren is incredibly captivating.  Also, the love scene is something you won't forget in a hurry ;)  I'm so glad I bought this movie off of Amazon--especially since I heard that it's ""out of print"" so to speak, so it will probably just get harder and harder to find, not to mention more expensive, with time.  Definitely get this movie while you can!",1301702400,4,589,4.679611650485437

The movie is not the greatest, when judged just on movie traits alone.
But you aren't looking at this movie for a great story line....be honest.
You are looking for a young, fresh, Christopher Atkins in all degrees of naked.
The movie holds up on it's own merit, and is helped by the man-flesh of the supporting cast/extras.",1251504000,6,516,4.681318681318682
1195735,4,B000006GEO,"I personally liked the movie.

1195744,2,B000006GEO,"The premise of this movie is too hoaky to be believed, isn't it?  Christopher Atkins, known best as Richard from The Blue Lagoon, makes some smart remark in class and has his teacher fail him.  His teacher, Lesley Ann Warren, goes out with some friends to see some male strippers and - surprise! - HE is one of them.  Then they have an affair.

I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.  Half of me is convinced that this is all just some weird dream and no one actually put this on paper, let alone made a whole movie out of this.  The other half of me is disgusted with whoever gave this the go ahead.  It's just too hilarious to believe, but it's real.  Recommend it?  Well, I guess I could.  If you're looking for something campy and silly, it's certainly that.  Sure, have fun with it.  Christopher Atkins was/is nice eye candy, I fully admit it, when he was in his prime and here at the peak of his heat.  Just so you know, he was awarded the Golden Razzie for this movie.  And it was deserved, no question, because this movie is so ... Bad.  And yet, you're drawn to it just for the eye candy that is Christopher Atkins.  Ha.",1215129600,2,1128,4.200934579439252

He: Shallow, not so smart poor boy with not much to offer the world but good looks and lack of sexual inhibitions.

She: Neglected wife, school teacher, female puts down macho student in class.

Student sees opportunity to take her down sexually and does.

Not a nice guy, but how many people are nice? Vulnerable wife, and how many people are vulnerable?

A lot of nice people get hurt by others who are not evil, necessarily but only shallow, and often shallow and bitter.

Husband: A sympathetic character.

Much better than most low-budget and yet non-""art"" films.",1156204800,15,646,4.7657657657657655
1195747,4,B000006GEO,I really enjoyed the movie soundtrack and the dancing in the movie. The plot was very interesting too. Over all I think A Night in Heaven was a okay movie.,1151625600,3,155,4.2

1195749,5,B000006GEO,"This movie took me back to my teen years and the era of disco and strip clubs.  Lesley Ann Warren who plays the teacher delivers a flawless performance, she is one of my favorite actresses.  Christopher Atkins is something to behold, if you have ever had a crush on any one of your teachers this is the film for you!  It is light and very entertaining, I highly recommened it.",1143936000,12,376,4.3428571428571425
1195750,2,B000006GEO,"The production of Night in Heaven is probably more interesting than film itself.  The film was written by Joan Tewkesbury and directed by John Avildsen so how was this 80 minute mess created?  It's a bad film, but if you're a fan of 80s cheese, you might like it as a nostalgia trip.  The music's actually pretty good.  The only extra on the DVD is the trailer and what's interesting about the trailer is that it actually advertises the movie that Night in Heaven could've been.  Another nice thing about the DVD is that the main screen features Bryan Adam's song Heaven.  I'm not sure but I think the song appeared in this film before it became a number one hit.",1129766400,2,663,4.43801652892562
1195751,2,B000006GEO,"""A Night in Heaven"" opened in 1983 to terrible reviews and even worse box office.  It was a mainstay on ten worst lists everywhere.  It was dubbed ""Flashdunce"" after another hit movie of that year.

Really, its not that bad.  Insubstantial, yes.  Ill-conceived, yes.  Entertaining?  Quite.

Lesley Anne Warren plays Faye, a speech professor at the local community college who is having marital problems.  Her husband Whitney (Robert Logan), an emotionally stunted inventor, has seemingly lost interest in her and she is becoming depressed when her sister Patsy (Deborah Rush) takes her out with friends to a local strip club.  There, Faye is surprised that the club's star stripper, Ricky the Rocket (Christopher Atkins), is the same cocky student she just flunked in her class.  When he sees her in the audience, Ricky does a virtual lapdance for her, and it isn't long before they have plunged into an affair.

Actually, there was probably a very good, serious film buried somewhere in writer Joan Tewkesbury's original script, which is glossily directed by Oscar-winner John G. Avildsen, who went from this fiasco to ""The Karate Kid"".  Unfortunately, the casting of Christopher Atkins in what was obviously originally a supporting role hurts the film considerably.  Cast after his breakthrough role in ""The Blue Lagoon"", Atkins received star billing and all of the film's pre-release publicity.  But Warren and Logan are the lead characters, have most of the screen time and obviously have the main relationship in the film.  This caused the film to be quite obviously heavily reedited to emphasize the Atkins character, who is a total jerk, completely amoral and unlikable, and poorly played by one of the worst actors ever to be spit out of the Hollywood system.  This sinks the film faster than the ""Titanic"".  As a result, what should have been a serious examination of a marriage at a crossroads becomes a smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama in which the disparate elements just don't fit.  Note the brief 80 minute running time.  This is one film which I wish could be reedited to a director's cut, so we can see what the writer and director's original intent was.  Instead, we will forever be saddled with the studio's botched reedit.

In spite of all this, ""A Night in Heaven"" remains entertaining and easy to watch.  Lesley Ann Warren gives a good performance here, although I'm sure this film isn't listed on her otherwise stellar resume.  Robert Logan is also quite good, although his presence is a bit of an eye-opener considering he is best-known for family films like ""The Wilderness Family"" and this film comes as close to soft-core porn as any major Hollywood studio film of recent decades.  Deborah Rush gives able support, and there's a decent performance here by an actress named Sandra Beall as Ricky's long-suffering girlfriend Slick.  The late Carrie Snodgress also has a couple of good scenes as Ricky's mother.  Unfortunately, Atkins' horrible acting just about negates the performances of everyone around him.  It's impossible to do excellent work when the person you are acting with can't act to save his life.  It makes you appreciate Warren's work even more.  That she manages to give a good performance under the circumstances is commendable.

One note:  This film contains one of the sexiest love scenes I have ever seen in a film, and is one of only three reasons to see it.  The other two?  Warren's performance and Bryan Adams' now-classic love them ""Heaven"", which plays in its entirety over the opening and closing credits.  When you take away the seven minutes for these sequences, that leaves 73 minutes of story, which makes the cuts even more noticeable.

""A Night in Heaven"" is one bomb from the early '80's that should have been much better, but remains more entertaining than many much better films of the era.

1195752,4,B000006GEO,"Leslie Ann Warren's character is questioning her marriage and her career.  Her friends invite her to go with them on a night on the town in a male stripper bar.  To her surprise, she discovers that one of the students whom she flunked in a college class is a stripper at the bar.  It becomes love at first sight as they drown in each others eyes on the dance floor, and the sexual tension between them is intense.  Meanwhile, Warren's husband lost his job and can't find work, and is constantly traveling trying to look for one.  The loneliness for Warren's character becomes too much to bear, and she calls the stripper/student (played with a quiet earnestness by Christopher Atkins) to meet him at a hotel.  She meets him at his car in a pouring rain, and admits that she wants him but is afraid. Atkins consoles her, then he and Warren go to the bedroom for one of the most intensely erotic sex scenes ever seen in an R-rated film.  (...)  What makes the hotel bedroom scene so erotic is the sexual chemistry between Warren and Atkins that grows and grows and grows, until Warren explodes with one of the greatest orgasms I've ever seen on film, regardless of rating.  Eventually, Warren discovers that Atkins is cheating on him with a girl his own age, and leaves him.  Warren's husband finds out about his wife's affair, and gets his revenge in a most unique way.  After all, this is what you expect with a Canadian film production.  Canadians are realists at heart, and it is reflected in the directing, the scriptwriting, and the acting.  Some American viewers of this may not like that, but that is not surprising.  In real life, nothing is simple, and the film ends that way, with Warren and her husband staring at each other at the kitchen table and the credits roll.",1097798400,12,1777,4.547169811320755
1195753,3,B000006GEO,"I remember watching this movie on HBO after its failure attempt at the box office when came out back in the early 80's.

(I think) cause Atkins cant be in high school but then again I could be wrong../male stripper by night ...Well Atkins has to pay his way for College Tution Fees...
Lesley Ann Warren is the teacher that happens to have Atkins in one of her classes at school. As I remember, Warren happens to go to the club that Atkins works at and OMG!! Both Atkins and Warren see each other,does either one run? Nope then there would be no plot line to follow...When Atkins secret job is out he makes the moves on Warren that begins a torrid affair. Oh,BTW Warrens character is married. Atkins don't mind, neither does Warren.  ""Heaven"" may not be Atkins nor Warren's best movie but the VERY bad acting is somewhat worthy to watch.  If you like to see revealing shots of Atkins, I do have to say that you gotta see this on a pay cable channel of if you can find this at a rental video store if there is one.

The movie was shot in various parts of Florida including Titusville, Ft. Lauderdale (the club Heaven is located there and used to be a popular disco called Nepenthe) and North Miami. I thought it was a decent b-move but it's not for young children to watch. There's some nudity male and female and the sex scene between Leslie Ann Warren and Christopher Atkins is quite graphic, something I didn't expect.
