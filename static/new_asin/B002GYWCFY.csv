8370097,5,B002GYWCFY,Very thorough and well documented.  The interviews with Dahmer himself put it over the top.  The detail was outstanding and very intriguing.,1403913600,4,140,5.318181818181818
8370098,4,B002GYWCFY,More fact than sensationalism makes this a good addition to the other items on this topic. The family films and photos are great too.,1361059200,3,133,4.583333333333333
8370099,4,B002GYWCFY,"A lot has changed since 1992, when Dahmer was arrested.  There have been serial killers who had more victims.  In DC, people feared that they could die at the gas station.  All hearts have gone out to the victims of Columbine, 9/11, Virginia Tech, etc.  Don't get me started on the homophobic way that the press dubbed Andrew Cunanan ""Dahmer Part Two.""  Still, the issues presented here are still fascinating.

I give a lot of credit to Dahmer's father Lionel.  One would think that most fathers of murderers wouldn't reveal their heads in public.  However, Dr. Dahmer attended the trial and visited his son in prison regularly.  He wrote an wonderful book about his ordeal which was turned into a mediocre, low-budget film.  He is interviewed here and you can really feel his humanity, shock, and embarassment.

This documentary includes the sistah who screams in court, ""Jeffrey!  I hate you!!!!""  It's still  powerful, and makes me teary, almost two decades later.  This documentary asserts what Dahmer himself did: he didn't target a race, but a body type.  Still, when 12 out of 17 victims of a non-black murderer are black, I can't help if some type of oppression is being enacted.  What is this nation saying to Black gay men if a dozen of them can be murdered and no one knows about it until much later?

There are some bad fictional films on Dahmer made and I prefer this documentary to them.  Because Dahmer suffered from severe alcoholism, I wonder if this work would be of interest to alcoholics and their loved ones.",1252195200,4,1529,4.723484848484849
