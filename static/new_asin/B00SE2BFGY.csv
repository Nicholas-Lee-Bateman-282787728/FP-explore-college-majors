8698204,5,B00SE2BFGY,"Wow!  So strange to see a CED disk for sale here.  CED was my first foray into video and I had quite a collection.  Dragonslayer was one of my favorites, getting many plays for me alone and sometimes with friends.  So strange to see the PG rating still on it since it is quite violent with graphic gore.  I sold my player and all the disks for $69, paid about 400 for the player and the disks must have set me back quite a sum, most were in stereo and cost anywhere from $15 to $30 and some more.  I would be most interested to learn who buys this and has a player and collection.",1468540800,,580,4.0
