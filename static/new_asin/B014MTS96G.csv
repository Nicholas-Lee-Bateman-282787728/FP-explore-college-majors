8731433,2,B014MTS96G,"The video quality dropped considerably compared to the beauty of Netflix. Though the audio sounded spot on. Changing the language and subtitles was rather easy. While I'm glad that I have the full set for such a low price, this feels like an overly grainy bootleg.",1504569600,,264,4.760869565217392
8731434,4,B014MTS96G,"It's a great collection, but... the quality is pretty decent, although not the best, I got a copy of the same thing on eBay for only 20.00 USD, and it not worth 60.00 USD in my opinion. Too much money for a dip in quality as much as that, grant it is both seasons and extras, I think it should be worth at least 35.00 USD, because you have some competition on eBay, from Amazon. I hope you found this helpful. Thanks again for the refund, -James",1471305600,,445,4.126436781609195
8731435,1,B014MTS96G,I will second the quality of the DVDs of this first reviewer. I didn't watch season 1 since I watched that on Netflix but after seeing his post I went back to check and yep it doesn't work after episode 15. The second half of season 2 isn't on there either.,1469750400,,257,4.0588235294117645
8731436,1,B014MTS96G,"The 1st disc season 1 only works through episode 15. The Alfheim arc continues to pause and skip with distortions. The 2nd disc about the same. I can't even watch the second half of season 2. The only disc without issues was the 3rd. Customer Service was good about getting back to me. That is the only reason I gave one star. Unfortunately, I was told that I couldn't exchange for a better copy. They offered to refund me half. still waiting...",1463011200,3,445,4.439024390243903
8731437,2,B014MTS96G,Episode 16 didn't work it plays for like 5 minutes then skips to the next episode. All the other episodes play just fine on my ps3. Besides missing an episode it was a good set for the price.,1449705600,3,191,4.052631578947368
