7803837,5,6300145697,"one of the  baddest live acts ever and this is prime and peak Kid Creole and the Coconuts.  also a time to remember nad pay respect  to  ""Bongo"" Eddie Folk  RIP who passed recently.  he threw down on those bongos
and had so much character and soul on stage. prayers go out to his family,friends
and fans worldwide.  this is a tight concert and showcases the musical versatility
and depth of the band. Kid Creole August Darnell is a musical beat on that stage.",1452211200,,459,4.392857142857143
