At the beginning I am able to view and listen to the prom of other movie. But the movie itself is SILENT and with subtitles in Spanish, which is ridiculous since the movie is from Argentina and it is spoken in Spanish !!!!!!!!!!  Very disappointed !!
I am expecting a reply from the seller, it will be appropriate a new DVD or a refund",1430265600,,462,4.25

7949939,3,B00005QAQS,"No commentary, no scene selection menu, no special features at all. The only menu available is to select 5.1 or French stereo audio. The image is 1080i which looks fine, but for some reason my tv drops the signal intermittently and I have to pause the player to get it back. This is the only disc out of my Blu Ray library to ever do that.

I recommend the DVD version over this one as it contains a full compliment of special features and maybe even the same video quality.",1324598400,4,474,4.266666666666667
7949940,3,B00005QAQS,"Well i rented this video from blockbuster and expected more than i got.  A great video for the beginner, decent video for intermediate, barely watchable for the expert skier.  So pick your catagory and decide.",964656000,14,209,4.942857142857143
