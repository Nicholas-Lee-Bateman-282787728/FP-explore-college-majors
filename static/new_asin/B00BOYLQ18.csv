8572018,3,B00BOYLQ18,Not horrible!  Decent movie worth seeing how it ends.,1424390400,,53,4.888888888888889
8572019,3,B00BOYLQ18,"Ridiculous premise, with even more ridiculous ""kills."" It was a fun watch and the short running time makes it bearable.",1419033600,,119,5.0
8572020,4,B00BOYLQ18,"Inliked this movie.  True, it was kind of on the corny side ,but it was also cute. It was obviously not meant tom be a serious horror movie ,but it did have a few unexpected thrills. I did find the music at the end of the movie a little disturbing, it didn't seem to fit the plot.  There were no ghost or spirits, or hauntings of any kind; but what you did have was seven teens stuck min an amusement park battling their way out, while being chased and tricked by a posse of weird clowns. It was like a cross between the Hunger Games, and Candyland,  Just good clean fun.!!I wouldn't watch it again, but I didfind it amusing.",1418083200,3,625,4.191666666666666

8572023,4,B00BOYLQ18,"I rather enjoyed Twilight Syndrome. It was interesting, the plot moved right along and the acting, what little was required, was pretty decent.",1405036800,2,143,5.260869565217392
8572024,5,B00BOYLQ18,"This was a cute movie. Yes its extremely low-budget, its amateurally shot, the acting isn't great and the story could use some fine-tuning. Despite all that I found it very charming. Its a great premise, has a couple fairly interesting characters, keeps you on your toes with odd little surprises and doesnt take itself too seriously.

The film felt like some kids just got together and decided to have fun making a movie with whatever they had. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a lot of heart. I was expecting it to be awful, but I found it endearing and fun. Loved it!",1404259200,3,601,4.463636363636364
8572025,3,B00BOYLQ18,Twilight Syndrome: Deadly Theme Park was an okay Japanese horror flick. The story is a pretty interesting one about a group of gamers traped in a virtual world controled by evil clown contructs. But I just felt the story and characters could of been better.,1373414400,2,257,4.733333333333333
