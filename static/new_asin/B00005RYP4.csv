1657960,3,B00005RYP4,"I may be a bit biased, because the reason I turned it to PAX and watched this movie was because of my 'obscure welsh actor obsession'.  I loved the movie, it was a cute story that makes you wonder... and Peter Wingfield is in it, what more could you want?",1023753600,8,255,4.1
1657961,1,B00005RYP4,"When I was on vacation, me and my sister turned over to PAX TV to see what was on, and it was none other than 'Miracle of the Cards.'  I saw Kirk Cameron, so I had to stick around to see what it was about. . .  I'm sorry I ever did.  Not only is the story completely bland and uninteresting, but the acting is, by far, some of the worst I have seen in recent memory.  All the performances are blocky, uninspired, and insipidly tireless.  We get one yelling session after another from the boy's mother, and his father just stands by and says ""Yes dear. . .""  Then we get to the doctor, who is nothing more than a hapless dope who doesn't know what the heck he's doing.  The boy, too, is a hopeless case as a little actor as he tries to act out sympathetically, but ends up grating on your every nerve.  And don't even get me started on the lifeless, derivative score, terrible useage of pop songs throughout, and the pitiable direction of Mark Griffiths (who can't seem to make even a decent film yet) all contribute to this phenomenally bad film which drags on and on and on. . .  The hypocrisy in the film is also ver ""in your face,"" with a mother who claims to be a good loving, Christian woman but curses anyone who annoys her and says that the ""miracle of the cards"" was a ""miracle of the world,"" completely shattering her ""miracle of God"" image and statements throughout the film.  You almost get the feeling it doesn't WANT to end.  Skip this movie at all costs!  Don't rent it, don't watch it at a friends, and most certainly don't even give it a second thought!  A complete waste of good film and talent (or lack thereof).",1020297600,13,1630,4.253246753246753

1658001,4,B00005RYP4,"I suppose everyone buys a movie and it's not exactly what they thought it would be.  Well, that's how I felt about Miracle of the Cards.  I like Kirk Cameron and thought that he would be the main actor, so his lack of parts kind of dampened the movie. In fact I'm not sure why he was in this movie.  Thomas Sangster has been making good movies for years but he was secondary as well.  I'm a dad and its hard for me to believe a dad would give up so quickly as this movie portrayed the father and I'm still not sure what the cards had to do with the miracle.  I understand that perhaps it gave the mother hope but the miracle was more than cards.  I'm not saying it was a poor movie just one that wasn't what I thought it would be.  Letters to God was much better and that kid didn't get the miracle the family wanted.  Sangster as a kid, had a much better part in Entrusted",1454889600,2,873,4.005780346820809
1658002,3,B00005RYP4,"I wanted to watch this because I love Kirk Cameron's movies, but I have to say this one is disappointing. Perhaps the film's target audience is Christians, but I feel like there was a disservice to those who are not Christians as this film didn't reference Jesus one bit. And the references to God are brief and instantly switch from faith in God to faith in doctors, cards and dreams. I feel like this film's premise was entirely too touchy-feely and the mother relied less on faith and more on God literally pointing out what she needed to do. While I do believe God can show people in incredible ways His will, I think this film focused too much on these signs and wonders.

The mother was also incredibly annoying near the middle of the film. Her husband was right, she needed to take it down a notch. But she was determined that she was right and thus, could act any way she wanted.

Kirk Cameron's character was not really a character. He had promise in the beginning, but if the point of the movie was that he changed his world view of religion and God, it failed miserably.

I wouldn't say this movie is as terrible as some people would say, but it's definitely not a strong Christian film at all. It's a nice story, but not one that I would recommend to people.",1453507200,,1270,4.395744680851064

1658028,4,B00005RYP4,"This movie is based on a true story of a little 8 year old boy who has cancer. He breaks the Guinness World record for receiving the most get-well cards (1.3 million cards from all around the world). While investigating the 'real facts' behind this true-life story which includes a real life miracle, a skeptical reporter (Kirk Cameron) expects to uncover an over-sensationalized account of God supposedly intervening in the lives of believers. What he finds is nowhere close to what he expects. This really is a heartwarming story of love and faith in the face of death.

This is a true story which non-believers will probably see as a fantasy . Believers will find it  heartwarming and an affirmation that miracles do happen. I enjoyed the movie and gained a new respect for the acting of Richard Thomas . Honestly, I didn't much like him as John-Boy way back when but I have enjoyed most of his new movie roles .

This is a 'watch once or twice a year movie' .  There are other Hallmark channel movies I will watch more often (like Safe Harbor, Trading Christmas and such).",1366156800,,1076,4.617801047120419
1658039,5,B00005RYP4,"Very touching movie.

Some have reviewed it and found it to be too idealistic.  To that I say, some situations in real life come out more to our liking than others.  This movie shows the former.  To see the latter in a realistic, encouraging presentation, try watching ""Letters to God.""

Personally, I'd recommend both",1365379200,,318,4.814814814814815
1658040,5,B00005RYP4,"The eight year old boy's true story has a powerful message of Faith and Hope impacting our priorities by melting away the pettiness of this life and experiencing a global out-pouring of empathy. The emphases is on the strength we can find in our total weakness/humility that moves us to ask for miracles regardless of the outcome.

The Actor's were Passionate!  Thank You!",1360800000,,372,4.888888888888889
1658041,5,B00005RYP4,"This was a real amazing story. I was moved and touched deeply by this story. We all have our issues in life, but we need to be reminded
that some of our issues are nothing - compared to issues that others have. The boy, like every young person, just wanted to be able to
grow and have a normal life. When the boy gets sick, his mother sees the signs to pursue in a given direction for his healing. Each time
things appear to go bad, another sign occurs. As you watch the movie and see the signs, you realize as a believer that many of us get
our own signs. We either do not recognize the sign or fail to follow the course it guides us to. At the point that the world record
holder will not honor the cards record, the world record company is held accountable by the public awareness. As this story shows, his
mothers' love for him was to hang the cards for him to look on and it became inspirational to all the people who watch the movie.",1360540800,,938,4.103260869565218

1658044,5,B00005RYP4,"He moves with a certain grace and he really acts like he cares. I am glad that Jesus advocated drinking when he made all that wine because sometimes when I get a glimpse of Kirk Camercon I can so worked up nothing can be done to help to relax me except for a lovely glass of Chablis and perhaps a curved 12 inch cucumber (extra bumps, please!) with ranch sauce.

When I saw Kirk's name on the DVD cover AND then I also saw Richard Thomas's I knew that I had to have this DVD because these were two of my favorite actors in the 70s and I wanted to help them out because I know it may be difficult to peak as a child and then be forever associated with a role that doesn't really resonated with today's 21st century humans.

godspeed, Kirk!",1353628800,2,738,4.118055555555555
1658045,5,B00005RYP4,This is a heartwarming true story with an excellent cast. Very inspiring and strongly recommended if you need a boost in life and help us remember how fortunate some of us are and how dreams can come true if you really want them to.,1315008000,2,232,4.295454545454546
1658046,5,B00005RYP4,"What a theatrical breath of fresh air. It's amazing how miracles can transpire in the most unexpected ways. Not like we think they would, but how God knows the way they should. I sincerely believe if TRUE FAITH were alive in the hearts of more people today we would see and hear of more amazing miracles like this. Cloud Ten has several heart warming movies, I only own 2, but I'll pick up others in the coming weeks. I hope to see more of these type of productions on the mainstream TV channels. What a great movie I'm glad it is part of my library.",1308700800,,550,4.247619047619048
1658047,1,B00005RYP4,"I watched this film when travelling and without much choice. The story is a sweet one and, unlike some reviewers, I thought that the kid's acting was fairly good; though nothing like as good as in ""Love Actually"" a couple of years later.
I'm not religious, I'm English and I am proud of the UK's National Health Service.  This means I'm not the natural target for this film.
The production values are not good. Another reviewer commented that the town that was supposed to be in England was unconvincing. I can only assume that the director has never visited the UK, or was too lazy of budget strapped to get the basics right. Or perhaps they never expected it to be seen outside the US.
If you're a US citizen who has a strong Christian faith, hasn't travelled much, is happy to take without any evidence the assertion that UK hospitals are dirty places where people rarely get better, this might be the film for you.  If you have some knowledge of relevant facts (eg UK life expectancy exceeds US), you will probably find it heavy going.  The core problem for me was this though; if God were stepping in to cure this kid, why did he need to go to the US for private treatment in the first place? It's a logical self-contradiction at the core of the film that I just couldn't step around.
I think that there's something to irritate the whole family in here. Christians can be irked at how the film attributes his recovery to the cards instead of God. Medics can be irritated that their efforts were attributed to divine intervention instead of their hard work and professionalism. UK health professionals will probably find the whole thing insufferable and insulting.
It has a few touching moments, but best appreciated if you're willing to suspend as much disbelief as when watching ""Star Wars"".",1294185600,6,1797,4.644654088050315
1658048,2,B00005RYP4,"Borrowed this from the library.  It is based on the true story of Craig Shergold, a boy with cancer who desires to break the Guinness Record of most ""Get Well"" cards received before he dies.  Not only does he break the record, he lives!
There is a bit of inspiration to be garnered and it was worth watching once, however, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it.  The acting was lacking; English accents would disappear, the boy seemed to be delayed in addressing his lines and often just sat there trying to ""look sick"".  Kirk Cameron's (tiny) role was obviously added just to get him in.  I was also quite dismayed at the direction/lines given to the mother, who's faith often seemed to revolve around the cards, rather than God.  While I can't imagine the immense stress this family must have been under ~ the mother was downright insufferable at points.",1230854400,2,860,4.7
1658059,4,B00005RYP4,"Coming into a movie of its sorts you're expecting the sorrows, with your klenex close by. Having this about a child allows for the water works.
The young antagonist of the movie comes across as a delightful personality. He's into football, and for Christmas his parents give him a new bike, but he's tired. He's lying on the sofa.
After the holidays, he mentions an earache, but the doc doesn't think much of it. Mom and the pharmacist at the drugstore believe otherwise, as he worsens. With the days passing, his mom worries about a developing nightmare.
Any parent can understand the dread, and fears, when their precious child is in harms way.
The way various family members take to the boy's serious illness feels real. It's a combination of elements.
My one gripe is with the mom shortly losing her focus. Her son's illness should've come before breaking the record.",1212105600,,871,4.774834437086093
1658060,5,B00005RYP4,"This is a very inspiring movie, much loved by my grandson. Thank you for such speedy service. The dvd arrived in great condition. Thanks.",1211673600,,137,4.75
1658061,4,B00005RYP4,"How closely this overtly Christian film hews to the ""true"" story I don't know, but I thought it worthwhile. The principals carry their parts off well, though Catherine Oxenberg, the American actress who plays the English mother, has trouble with the English accent throughout and doesn't quite get the English mannerisms across.

The flow of the picture is a tad too easy-going, considering the harrowing nature of the boy's illness, but, in general, the tone is appropriate. The brief appearance of Richard Thomas is one of the highlights.

Parts of the film evidently were shot in the U.K., but most of it appeared to be made in Vancouver. The frequent display of the Union Jack is a contrivance intended to add some authenticity to the shots, but is not typical of the British, who generally do not express their patriotism that way. There's quite a bit of mild swearing of the British variety, but it will go past most American viewers.",1186617600,,940,4.832298136645963
1658062,3,B00005RYP4,"When I learned the premise that The Miracle of the Cards is based on, that discovery was met with an inward groan. Here it is: a young boy with a brain tumor, not likely to survive, wants to break the Guinness Book of World Records count for receiving get-well cards. I was glad to see that the movie is based on a true story, at least, and not some urban legend or internet hoax.

The story is told mostly through flashbacks during a sceptical reporter's interviews with the young patient's parents. From the mother's nightmares of seeing her son in a coffin (which began before his first symptoms), to his hospitalization and diagnosis with a rare form of cancer and his pursuit of the record for most cards received, this sentimental story is worth watching if you can remind yourself that it is based on a true story and that it's not a sappy takeoff on an urban legend / internet hoax.

Good production values, a few solid performances and what could have been a more compelling story line are unfortunately offset somewhat by a premise that has been defamed by internet hoaxes and by the length of the film at 89 minutes. Whether or not an hour and a half was needed to tell this story is debatable, but when a movie feels too long, it probably is.",1142208000,7,1254,4.471615720524017
1658063,5,B00005RYP4,"I was compelled to watch this movie after I read 2 reviews on this site stating it was an Insult to God, that this Mother gave all her glory to the Cards, stating the movie should be thrown in the trash & ends with scriptures -- Then an earlier review saw only Hypocrisy. I'm thinking, WHAT??!!  A movie like this, I just had to take a look!  As a Christian myself (obviosly not the kind they are, what would they have done - given their son a sermon every day while he laid in the hospital bed ?).  I DID NOT see this Mother giving GLory to the cards at all, I counted the times she thanked God, and they were MANY ...What I seen was a Mother who was guided, who believed, who hoped, who dared to do whatever it took to save her son's life (which is love), she saw the light in his eyes when he opened his cards, he believed all those people sending cards were praying for him, this gave him Hope/Encouragement -which his Doctor ordered the parents to give him, what he NEEDED.  How can one not see God (or inspiration) at work in this? Life is full of wonderful things in wonderful unexpected ways, even in the midst of some of the chaos, He is there.  This card campaign -which spanned the globe- might have led to a Guinness Book World record, but the more important thing was it led to a Doctor in the United States who was able to perform the surgery to save his life.  So God Used the ""Cards"", or He allowed the Card Campaign to be used to bring these important people into this child's life-to save Him.  What could be more glorious than that, what Joy to these parents, what answered prayer.  It's an incredible story, and it's TRUE--which makes it even better!  Funny thing is, all these years later, those crazy cards are still coming, thanks to some chain letters on the internet that just won't die.  I think all of us should be this sensitive to what gives OUR CHILDREN  hope/encouragement in a time such as this.",1134777600,16,1927,4.295580110497237
1658064,5,B00005RYP4,This is a great inspiring movie based on a true story.  The cast is perfect and the movie reminds us that God is still in the miracle business!

1658065,5,B00005RYP4,"I happened to just be browsing yesterday at Border's and found this unknown (to me) film.  Apparently it was produced by PAX.  I figured anything with Kirk Cameron in it ought to be worthwhile.  I had no idea that what makes this movie is the inspiring story of a little british boy who has a brain tumor and the never waivering faith of his mother who sets out with help from many (and the shining light of God's presence) to give her son the will to fight and to live and know that he will be cured!  Based on a true story, the film is replete with an unforgettable musical score, top notch direction and marvelous performances by the entire cast!  It is not over-sentimentally sappy and never preachy.  It is a honest depiction of God's incredbile working power!  The one negative review in this forum is obviously from one cynical viewer who has missed the point of the entire film.  Believe the four and five star reviews on this one folks.  This is indeed a beautiful and inspiring film!",1120262400,5,993,4.472222222222222
1658066,4,B00005RYP4,"The reason I watched this film is because I have a connection with the real story. For me thats always what makes this film real and brings back many memories. Sadly I did think the acting at times was a little less than desirable and those english accents were poor at times, although the story behind the film will pull me back to watch it again and again. Actually quite funny for me seeing Carshalton portrayed as such an American town!! Its nothing like that in real life - our door numbers rarely go past the hundreds in England!!  The DVD is better than the VHS purley due to the extras - Craig is 25 now and fit and well and its nice to hear him on the DVD. For anyone who liked the film Marion Shergold released a book many years back called 'a mothers story'. Thats a very good read and I would recommend it highly!!",1080172800,20,826,4.227848101265823
1658067,5,B00005RYP4,"It's become apparent to me that the Christian Movie Genre has gone unnoticed by a great many Christians.  This true story of this 8 year old boy should be seen by anyone who is looking for faith and hope.  At first glance one might think that the story of a kid receiving over a million cards is nice, but not worth sitting through.  Wrong on both counts!  I put off seeing it for these reasons, and when I finally saw it I now put it up there among my favorite Christian movies.  This is a well scripted, professionally filmed movie.  The acting is superb. The story moves right along at a good clip and at the end - the hardest among us will probably have teary eyes and a feeling of love and caring that we never had before.  Understanding this movie is sort of like flexing a muscle that has never been flexed before.  And its done by suddenly realizing that God is there.  He just doesn't flaunt it, and He is working in such a way that will benefit the most.",1078876800,7,964,4.224043715846994
1658068,5,B00005RYP4,"The acting begins on the solid footing of an adorable ""poster child"" eight-year boy who develops a deadly brain tumor.  This boy's charm alone would have garnered the film three stars.
The mother and father could have been his real parents--they played their parts so naturally.  Mom won't give up when treatment becomes more aggressive and less likely to succeed.  Dad believes it is best to be realistic and make the boy's last days comfortable and peaceful.  Additionally, the struggle over pursuing ""the miracle in the cards"" was most realistic.
The main physician, Dr. Middleton, proved a master at being a compassionate but professional medical man, while communicating with a mother who believes he is destined to save her apparently doomed child.
Richard Thomas may not conjur up an image of brain surgeon in most people's minds, but he did play the role of counseling the sick child and his parents well.  Perhaps he came across more as a hospital chaplain than a surgeon.  Nevertheless, the role worked, and rounded out the story smoothly.
Finally, there is Kirk Cameron as the skeptical ""hard news"" journalist assigned to a feature story.  He seems most comfortable in the role of feature journalist--much more than his attempts at hard news, such as in the Left Behind movie.  He does not pan out as much of a skeptic.  Nevertheless, his role added a sweet touch, that closed the film nicely.
Concerning the plot, there is a fair amount of tension in this film--though it aims more to inspire than tease.  Towards the end, I started to wonder if there was ever going to be an upward turn in this downward spiraling medical tale.  Then, right at the end there is the abrupt medical update...one I will not divulge.  My one complaint is that the ending came rather suddenly--though the actual story may have been the same.
