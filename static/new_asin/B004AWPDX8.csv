4312531,5,B004AWPDX8,"Sadie is an awesome instructor and it is well worth the effort to take her classes in-person if you can catch her.  She is authentic, spiritual and funny --all at the same time. Transformative!",1291334400,3,193,4.676470588235294
4312532,5,B004AWPDX8,"I've done many of Sadie's videos on YouTube and followed her 21-day class on DailyOM so I had an idea of what to expect. She absolutely didn't let me down. The matrix menu is great because on busy days it allows me to choose what I want to focus on (it's divided into core, standing, floor, etc). This is so useful because I can build the practice I want on any given day.

Having done the full DVD straight through once so far (about one hour and 40 minutes), I can say without a doubt that this is a yoga DVD that will change your body and strengthen you in ways you may not even know possible. People still don't believe that yoga can be good for strength training but I'm showing signs of a 6-pack that says otherwise.

Sadie is also amazing in that she narrates the whole workout while still doing the routine. There are no voice-overs. Her alignment tips are spot-on and her background in truly understanding anatomy shows through. She's also very good at knowing when you're likely to slip out of proper alignment and will remind you to straighten this or support that at just the right moment. Reminders of when and how to breathe are also invaluable in this DVD.

More than just physical though, this DVD truly encompasses the inner workings of yoga as well, helping you to focus and let go of things you no longer need to hold onto in your mind and heart.

As a final note, although it shouldn't matter where a yoga DVD is filmed, I must say that the backdrop of Sedona makes for one heck of a beautiful and inspiring session.

If you're still unsure, I suggest hitting up YouTube and doing a search for Sadie Nardini, seeing what she can do for you, and then come back and get this DVD. It will change you.",1300060800,11,1717,4.353125
4312533,5,B004AWPDX8,"This video is great for those ""I'm not in the mood to work out"" days, because Sadie's style is so fluid and calming that you can start it, even when feeling lazy, and pretty soon you're balancing on your hands.",1298160000,4,210,4.275
4312534,5,B004AWPDX8,"Yesterday I did the whole 90 minutes DVD (and today I feel the good soreness) and I really liked the practice. I love it much better than her previous DVD, although the last DVD has more material, but unfortunately no matrix. On this DVD you can custumize your practice and it is filmed outside with a beautiful scenery which are 2 big pluses for me, you also have 2 audio tracks : one with music and the other without. the practice has a good pace and it's not too fast , but it's still flowy and has cool new quirky but fun variations that Sadie has come up with like doing some sort of karate kicks from hero pose during core salutation or doing back kicks while in standing splits. I also liked that she did some arm balances (crow,side crow,firefly) during the different standing pose sequences (that included side angle, half moon , goddess to name a few) as opposed to a seperate arm balance segment like in the previous DVD. The core segment is nice as well with some plank\side planks variations and side navasana. The floor stretch has pigeon pose, one of my favorites. The inversions segment is nice but weird, she does headstand with plenty of instructions until she finally do a headstand and then wheel pose and supine pigeon and that's it, no shavasana, that's one of the bummers, I would have also liked some more backbends and maybe a shoulderstand as well but oh well! you can't have everything you like and it's still my favorite Sadie DVD so far.",1297209600,6,1466,4.515037593984962
4312535,5,B004AWPDX8,"I'm writing this review from just one encounter with this DVD. I did not have the time or energy for the full 90 minutes but only omitted 2 sections for my first go round.
Warm-up (12 minutes)
Core Salutations (14 minutes)
Warrior Sequence 1 (14 minutes)
Deeper Core Strength (7 minutes)
Floor Stretch (12 minutes)
Inversions/Counterposes (12 minutes)

I am saving these sections for another yoga day
Warrior Sequence 2 (12 minutes)
Balancing Sequence (11 minutes)

I want to counter the reviewers who say that Sadie is too chatty. She's not ""chatting"", she's *instructing* and continually encourages you to break out of the comfort zone of familiar patterns that may not be serving you or allowing you to be more than you are and I don't think that is ""chatty"". The very detailed instruction, which is coming into your brain via both right brained imagery and left brained linear detail is fabulous. I find myself able to access my psoas muscles and the rest of my deep core in much more confident ways from following her instruction. This DVD, like the 37 minute Core/Belly DVD (also filmed in Sedona) feel like yoga physical therapy to me, giving me time and space to move and consider in new ways how I use my body.

I'm 50 years old and very fit, but after so many years of using muscle groups in certain ways, I do believe (as a Feldenkrais patient) that messages from the brain to the muscle groups do get corrupted and can, with re-teaching, create new neural pathways to healthier and pain-free ways of moving and living in one's body. This new Sadie Nardini yoga DVD, I believe, is a great asset to accomplish this.

And for the record: The most vigorous yoga I do burns about 300 calories in an hour and this would include very active sections from Shiva Rea Fluid Power and Shiva's Agni Fire flow which includes 108 (9 sets of 12) pushups. I burned 280 calories today in 70 minutes of Sadie Nardini yoga. I don't think that's too shabby.

At the end of my practice, as I lay in Shavasana, I felt my qi moving throughout my body, buzzing and humming. I feel well worked, peaceful and strong. And those are several of the main reasons I have a yoga practice. I highly recommend this DVD and it *will* become a part of my regular rotation.",1296432000,10,2248,4.568238213399503
4312536,4,B004AWPDX8,"I'll start this review by saying that I am a huge fan of Sadie Nardini's dvds.  However, this is probably my least favorite for a few reasons. First, this dvd seems considerably less ""athletic"" than the others.  I'm not a traditional yogi -- I generally prefer power yoga and very athletic ashtanga yoga.  I personally look for a workout from yoga, not a meditation.  This video is considerably slower paced than Sadie's others, and much more ""chatty"".  I will say that there are still some powerful, excellent strength-building sequences in here, but I found myself really missing the faster flow of Sadie's Power Hour dvd (which I absolutely love), for example.

However, I am giving the video 4 stars because it does contain very helpful, very detailed instructions, and excellent cueing.  I don't see adding this video to my workout rotation very often because of the relatively slow pace, but I do appreciate the fact that Sadie's instructions on this dvd are helpful in correcting some of the bad habits that I've acquired from doing my yoga workouts at home, versus in a studio with an instructor.  I will definitely pull it out occasionally when I feel as if I need to focus on improving my postures.

I can see how people looking for a more spiritual yoga video would love this one, but I'll stick with her faster paced dvds.",1294876800,17,1334,4.740259740259741
4312537,4,B004AWPDX8,"This DVD is set up with a ""matrix"" menu, i.e. there are 8 individual segments that you can play from start to finish or pick and choose based on time and mood.  The segments are:

Warm-up (12 minutes)
Core Salutations (14 minutes)
Warrior Sequence 1 (14 minutes)
Warrior Sequence 2 (12 minutes)
Balancing Sequence (11 minutes)
Deeper Core Strength (7 minutes)
Floor Stretch (12 minutes)
Inversions/Counterposes (12 minutes)

The Good: Filmed in Sedona, the scenery is gorgeous.  Sadie's flows are really creative; you won't feel like you're just repeating the same set of sun salutations a million times.  Sadie's cueing is very clear and I rarely had to look up at the screen to figure out what the next pose was.

The Bad: Sadie talks.  Alot.  I tend to like a verbose instructor, but even I felt that some of the chat kept me from sinking deeply into my practice and I didn't feel nearly as relaxed at the end as I usually do.  Sadie uses a lot of lingo that (I think) she developed (""heavy metal golden egg"" for example) and I sometimes found myself distracted trying to figure out what the heck she was talking about.  That being said, she gave a lot of good tips on getting the most out of poses.

There is also no cool down segment and I really missed that.  If you want to end your practice with Savasana (corpse pose) you'll either need to do the Inversion segment (includes headstand and wheel) or you'll need to add it on your own.

Bottom Line: This is a unique flow yoga DVD.  Sadie is chatty, but has a cool perspective to share.  I wouldn't recommend this for pure beginners, however if you have some yoga experience under your belt there will be something for you in this DVD.  I'm hoping that if I stick with this I may just be able to figure out crow pose one of these days!",1292976000,35,1792,4.450920245398773
4312538,5,B004AWPDX8,"Finally !! I received this DVD today and couldn't wait to practice :-) Although I didn't get to doing the entire hour and half I must say this is a great addition to Sadie's other DVDs. I absolutely love her previous DVDs but the flows in this one are sooo creative and engaging...special mention about the ""warm ups"" and ""core salutations"". The ""warrior"" sections too are challenging and creative enough for you to feel the burn...Get ready for ""kicks of fire"" and ""golden egg"" !! This DVD stands apart for its amazing landscape and sounds of nature which seem to enhance the practice. Sadie also pays special attention to alignment in all her poses (which I found very helpful) and her instruction is natural and fun. The matrix option is another plus, especially if you are short on time and want to design a customized condensed practice. Overall, an excellent choice to add variety into Sadie's Core Strength Vinyasa practices.",1291680000,8,932,4.83125
4312539,5,B004AWPDX8,"Sadie Nardini is pretty much amazing.  I'm working toward a 200hr. Core Strength Vinyasa yoga certification with her right now, and I have to say I've never met a yoga teacher more in the know about anatomy and alignment.  She teaches from a place of safety and strength, making poses readily attainable and challenging at the same time.  I highly recommend ANYTHING that gives people a chance to experience yoga from her perspective!",1291593600,5,434,4.917808219178082
4312540,5,B004AWPDX8,"Sadie is an astonishingly good teacher, her style is wonderful and flowing, and you really feel like you have used all of your body, mind, spirit, heart and breath in her flowing classes. I am doing her teacher training, and would highly recommend her dvd's to really connect you back to your umoving core. She is amazing!",1291593600,2,322,4.666666666666667
4312541,5,B004AWPDX8,"Sadie's videos are always inspiring, challenging (but not ridiculously so) and effective, and this one is no exception. Since Sadie overcame her own physical challenges through yoga, there's an energy of understanding and compassion in her teaching that is so comforting to those of us who are struggling with weight issues. If you're on the fence about this DVD, check out Sadie's free videos on YouTube; you'll get a good idea of her teaching style there. Then come back and buy this program... you'll be so glad you did!",1291593600,4,523,4.887640449438202
8421084,5,B004AWPDX8,This disk is not for the beginner. It is a good workout for seasoned yogis. Add it to your collection if you dare.,1377475200,,114,4.0
8421085,5,B004AWPDX8,"Sadie Nardini's teaching style is pleasant, easy to follow and interspersed with words of wisdom, guiding you to make the connection between body, mind and soul.  This has a matrix menu, allowing you to select your own combination, which is always an appreciated feature.  We recommend this DVD in the Mind, Body, Spirit category of the emporium by linen & lavender.",1359763200,,366,4.983606557377049
8421086,4,B004AWPDX8,"I love Sadie Nardini 's style of yoga .She reminds me to time all my movements to my breathing and be aware of my core throughout the session. I do daily yoga 5 days a week with DVDs ,then twice more with local instructors. I consider myself to be a strong intermediate practitioner of yoga and appreciate good directions and some challenging postures ,too.",1358640000,,357,4.59375
8421087,5,B004AWPDX8,This came on time and I am enjoying learning new poses. Sadie Nardini is a great teacher. I would recommend this DVD.,1357603200,,117,4.363636363636363
8421088,4,B004AWPDX8,"Though I have another one of Sadie's discs and didn't really like it, I decided to give this one a try. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. A realatively challenging workout with some interesting pose combinations, this is a nice addition to my collection.

The thing that most impressed me was Sadie's thorough instruction. She seemed to anticipate the small allignment mistakes I might make and hade a very pointed way of explaning the poses that I found, frankly, really useful and helpful, even though I have been doing yoga for many years.

Filmed outside in the desert, with music option of having it on or off.",1329091200,,623,4.7592592592592595
8421089,5,B004AWPDX8,"Just got her DVD, and have been watching her YouTube videos. I originally was using Nicki Doane videos, and David Swenson videos and books. When did just one YouTube video I felt stronger, healthier, and a stronger mind-body connection than I had in an entire year with Nicki and Davids routines. Sadie is internal and moves completely differntly than any yogi ive ever seen. She is truly something amazing and I feel a strong connection to myself and my yoga practice after incorporating her teachings into my practice. I live in CA and am planning to travel to NYC to get a class from her, but until then I have this video :).",1328659200,,628,4.566371681415929
8421090,5,B004AWPDX8,"I have all of Sadie's other dvds, but this is by far my favorite! This one has a matrix option and I can always get a good workout in with the amount of time I have. They all flow really well no matter which ones you pick and even when I pick 3 or 4 workouts (so about 45mins to an hour) when it is over I am always thinking ""I am done already??!!"". But in a good way, obviously :o) I heart Sadie her workouts, instruction and inspiration are amazing!!",1322870400,,452,3.978021978021978
8421091,5,B004AWPDX8,I love Sadie and her video because she is so educated in the yoga field and she always encourages you to do what you can and not what others do. She gives a great yoga strengthening workout.,1310515200,,190,4.162162162162162
8421092,3,B004AWPDX8,"I started to dislike this video when I tried to use the matrix which is the worst of the matrix formats I have seen.  You better remember which sequences you chose because there's no way to tell, pretty cheesy.  Next, there's no music, just her incessant chatter which was pretty annoying and made me really wish I had grabbed a Shiva Rae or Sara Ivanhoe DVD instead.  There's nothing more annoying to me than poses (crow) put on a home workout DVD, which I personally feel should be taught and practiced in person.

On a postive note, I did feel the burn after the workout, but seriously doubt I'll be reaching for this DVD again...disappointed for sure.",1309564800,4,655,4.572649572649572
8421093,4,B004AWPDX8,"i love this video and the many others i have by Sadie - she's a great teacher, and motivator -- i can't say enough good things about it. very focused, very challenging, very worth it~ blessings",1301875200,,193,4.388888888888889
