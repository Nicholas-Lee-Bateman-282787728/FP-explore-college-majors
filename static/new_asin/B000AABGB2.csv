8076916,4,B000AABGB2,"Fun Old Movie - If this was the intro of Gene Autry it makes sense why so many of the cast are better known for the cowboy westerns they made.
This thing is full of cameo's if you liked westerns, the easy one was Cisco Kid's partner Pancho.
As for the story it is a repeated gem, the work of a record company or better yet it's A&R reps.",1507248000,,337,3.898550724637681

8076918,5,B000AABGB2,"This movie was bought because Gene Autry is in it.  He has a small part but it was interesting to see him when he was much younger.  Leo Carrillo is the best character in the movie.  I knew him as the Cisco Kid's pal Pancho on television when he seemed to be of Spanish origin.  However, he is of Italian descent in this movie and is hilarious.",1456358400,,344,4.08955223880597
8076919,5,B000AABGB2,"While searching through the VCI Entertainment online catalog this month, I discovered a title I must have missed before but Im REALLY glad I found it! Its the 1937 film Manhattan Merry-Go-Round  with a huge bunch of stars.
YES, Im giving this DVD five stars  even though, as you will see, it has some issues  because I LOVE IT, and it entertained me for nearly 90 minutes. And, too my knowledge, there are no better versions out there.  If someone were to release a restored version that would be great. But this is too much fun to miss, even in the current release. And its a budget priced DVD.

The film was a lot of fun and features lots of music performances including songs by Ted Lewis, Kay Thompson (in one scene where they introduce early television) and Cab Calloway. Not only does Gene Autry get to sing but we hear Joe DiMaggio sing too! Phil Regan gets to star and sing and theres a great cast of character actors (love James Gleason as a Danny The Duck who works for a loan shark).

I was fully entertained and can highly recommend this DVD but I need to point out the defects too. First, the print is great with no scratches and the images are clear. The sound was not cleaned up and there is a good deal of surface noise (or whatever the technical term is). If only there was a way to clean that up, it would be perfect. The VCI DVD has a few other annoying issues that I wish had been corrected. First, there are no chapters; just one long one. So you cant go to the musical numbers or even search for scenes. Not sure why they didn't take that extra step. And the other strange thing is that  - while the film is 87 minutes long, the DVD runs for 92 minutes, with five minutes of a blank screen at the end.

Again, I will repeat that this is one of VCIs earlier releases and they have offered nice restored versions in the past.  This apparently came from the TV release. But its in their budget line and is really cheap  especially when they have their 50% off sale. So, while some of you may know this film, I can only encourage others to seek it out. I had a lot of fun watching it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I've seen better musicals, but Manhattan Merry-Go-Round did entertain me as light, escapist fare with a few interesting plot twists and some comparatively well done numbers. Some of the actors did a great job while others could have worked harder at acting more convincingly; for example, when Kay Thompson (playing herself) is singing along with a chorus of young ladies sometimes the chorus seems cheerful and at other times--in the same sequence--the chorus looks quite sad as if a funeral has just broken out! The choreography is rather good but the cinematography is also uneven--at times the camera was very well used but again (and this is just one example) in the scene that has Kay Thompson with the chorus, the camera at times makes it appear as if Kay and the chorus were looking at each other yet at other times it is clear that the chorus is looking straight ahead and therefore not at Kay who is sitting at the piano looking straight ahead from her own perspective! The plot moves along well although they could have edited out a few minutes to make the action tighter but then again the background musical score does enhance the film. The quality of the print could have been better but at least my copy wasn't tinted green as another reviewer notes.

When the action starts, we meet gangster Tony Gordoni (Leo Carrillo) and his ""boys;"" Tony has just taken over a recording studio that makes records but Tony doesn't even understand what making records actually is! They make fun of the gangster film genre with this angle to the plot because Tony doesn't appear knowledgeable about something as basic as making records for people to play on record players which was common at the time; they didn't have CDs like we do now! There is some stereotyping of Italian people as well (ouch). At any rate, Tony and his men go to the studio and demote the top guy J. Henry Thorne (Selmer Jackson); now Tony is in charge. Thorne explains to Tony that they have to make records although there's also the issue of what to do about a former recording artist who very much alienated Thorne after a huge fight, Jerry Hart (Phil Regan). It's also interesting to see that Jerry is in love with Mr. Thorne's secretary Ann Rogers (Ann Dvorak) and fortunately for Jerry now that Tony is in charge of the studio Ann convinces Tony to rehire Jerry.

And they make records and sell them--until, that is, Tony's mother insists that Tony make a record in Italian! This leads to a series of unexpected consequences as Tony forces Jerry to miss his own wedding to Ann to talk the great Italian opera star Charlizzini (Tamara Geva) to make a recording. I could tell you more about the plot both up to now and after but I will stop here so you can watch the film and hopefully be entertained watching how everything plays out.

Look for some great cameos by Ted Lewis and His Orchestra as themselves; Cab Calloway and His Cotton Club Orchestra as themselves; Kay Thompson and Her Ensemble; Joe DiMaggio as himself; Louis Prima and His Band and Gene Autry also as himself. James Gleason plays ""Danny the Duck,"" one of Tony's men; Henry Armetta plays Spadoni; Luis Alberni plays Martinetti; Max Terhune plays himself and Smiley Burnette plays ""Frog,"" an accordion player. Whitey's Lindy Hoppers are amazing and if you look closely you can see Ralph Edwards as an uncredited radio man and Dorothy Arnold as a dancer who became Joe DiMaggio's first wife after they met while filming this movie.

Manhattan Merry-Go-Round has its pluses and minuses; but I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it. In addition, people who enjoy musical comedies with some drama may want this for their collections.",1380931200,2,3696,4.704791344667697
8076921,4,B000AABGB2,"I was tipped off about ""Manhattan Merry-Go-Round"" by mention of it in Kostya Kennedy's marvelous book ""56."" It was on the set of the movie that Joe DiMaggio met his drop dead gorgeous first wife Dorothy Arnold. ""Manhattan Merry-Go-Round"" was also for nearly two decades the name of a popular music program on NBC radio. Like the movie, it also sought to capture the atmosphere of a night club.",1341619200,3,393,4.7101449275362315
8076922,4,B000AABGB2,"This is for the VCI release.  While this film shows its age, it is most acceptable viewing.  Unfortunately, it is a TV re-issue print in which the beginning Republic logo has been removed, and the end title appears changed.  It should be noted the VCI release is a DVD-R and clocks in at 87 min.  I have not yet been able to confirm the running time.",1325116800,,350,4.257575757575758
