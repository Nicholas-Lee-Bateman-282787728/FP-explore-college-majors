This one is fun--Larry Talbot brought back from the dead by Superman's Inspector Henderson (Robert Shayne).  Love those old-timey actors.",1482537600,,398,5.403225806451613

It begins at the Los Angeles Hall of Justice. Detective Lt. R. Chasen tells about this case. Butcher Benton was convicted on the word of his accomplices, he refused to share the $600,000 loot with them. Im going to get you. He won't tell where the stolen money is hidden. Lt. Chasen will continue to investigate even though this case is closed. Eva Martin is a professional dancer, she didn't know. Paul Lowe opens that letter to find a map. Dr. Bradshaw wanted a human body for experimentation, and gets one. An electrical jolt is applied, will it work? Drugs are used too. Benton attacks the men who brought him back to life. [No good deed ever goes unpunished.] Lt. Chasen tells about his past. He wants to find that $600,000 loot and convict Bentons accomplices.

Eva tells about her past, she won a beauty contest and came to Los Angeles. Chasen watched Marcelli and Lowe. Marcelli is unemployed and takes a job offer (no one wants a squealer). Benton walks to Los Angeles, then finds a car with a flat tire. This is repaired, Benton drives away with it. One patrol car finds him but can do nothing! The whole force is on the job. Benton visits Eva and learns about the letter. Then she calls Chasen. Eva warns Sweeney, but he doesnt believe her. Fingerprints on the stolen car identify the killer! Eva rides the railway. [Bunker Hill?] Paul Lowe is ordered out of a bar after he asks for help. Will he be safe at his office? Will his pistol save his life? Then Eva learns about another murder.

The police learn more about Benton. Can the police find and stop him? Can a flame-thrower stop him? Benton finds the hidden cash. [It looks fresh after being stored in a damp environment.] The police shoot a bazooka rocket at Benton, it does little! They find the money. The flame thrower is used, to no avail! Benton escapes through a hatch in the sewer. There is an electrical power substation. Danger High Voltage is the warning sign. Benton climbs a ladder to escape. There is a great electrical flash, and Benton is stopped. The money was recovered, case closed. Chasen gets 48 hours off. Eva is happy its over. There is a change in her plans. [Will it work out?]

This is an interesting adaptation of the Frankenstein horror story for modern times. It shows Los Angeles as it existed in the early 1950's. Note the few automobiles on the streets then. The final scenes recall He Walked By Night. It is a good movie but not a great one (like a TV movie). Were there similarities to The Asphalt Jungle? This movie did not have a big budget. Lon Chaney Jr. played in many movies since The Wolf Man.",1477180800,,2632,4.523109243697479
