8178944,4,B000NJWIFS,"I enjoyed this film.  The director throws in a monkey-wrench once in a while, changes the plot and surprises you. A bit crazy when the aliens and the robot enter the story.  Obviously dubbed from the Spanish. I'm giving this 4-stars.",1297814400,,233,4.658536585365853
8178945,3,B000NJWIFS,This movie was weird and interesting.  It was pretty funny and at times made no sense but you could still follow it.  I recommend it to people who like interesting movies.,1215475200,,171,4.483870967741935
