186783,5,1567301614,"This is a film about three  promiscuous  people looking for  every  opportunity to have sex, without any qualms of conscience or fear of Aids. It makes you quite envious. Marie, who is living with and supporting Alexandra, doesn't complain about and senses no danger in these peripheral affairs; she has a firm believe in the soundness of their core relationship.
As Alexandra  is walking past a cafe one day constantly on the look-out, he catches the eye of Veronika and decides that she will be his next adventure. Without a moments hesitation he chases after her as she leaves the cafe and says, ""I haven't time to go for a drink at the moment but will you give me your telephone number?"" She does, and from that moment Marie finds herself with some serious competition. At first she is so sure of Alexandria's love that she is even willing to allow Veronika to share their bed! Only later does she have misgivings and pangs of jealousy.
Veronika is far from being your wholesome girl-next door,  she too is addicted  to sex and offhandedly mentions that she has been with a great many men in the five years since her 20th birthday. Being a nurse she says makes it easy for her.
Alexandra is an idle,  narcissistic,  garrulous intellectual who will spout his ideas to anyone willing to listen. He has that much in common with Veronika; both have long scenes in which they talk in close-up directly to the camera. Because of this and because there are so many of these scenes and the film is so long, you have a real sense of getting to know the characters. There is one long scene in which nothing happens at all but which didn't bore me for a moment. Marie, alone, puts on a long-playing record and then lies on the mattress on the floor in her sparsely furnished shambles of a bed-sit and we listen with her to the whole of one long track of music. Apart from lifting her hand to her face at one point she does nothing and yet we feel sympathy for her and feel we know her better at the end of it.
Such uneventful scenes are a characteristic of French films and are what make them seem so realistic and  true to life. They seem realistic because in real life we do listen for long periods to others talking, and we do listen to music with others in silence, and because we are with these people as we are with friends in real-life. Thus the length of the film is a positive advantage. I recommend it.",974332800,23,2405,4.420814479638009
186784,5,1567301614,"first off, let me start off by defining my rating system so you can get a grasp on how brilliant this film is.  There is only one film that i consider amazing (9/10) and that is Full Metal Jacket.  there are a handful  of others clustered at 8, but it is a very selected few (i.e., LaStrata,  Persona, apaclopyse now)
why is this movie so brilliant?  well, for  starters, it has something that most foreign films, as well as movies in  general, lack -- origionalliy.  No, this film is not like the other foreign  films that you have seen that rant on about harsh childhoods under a  catholic upbringing and how everything depresses them (although those can  be interesting).
The movie is the story of a person feeling towards  love, and how a person's grasp on love continues to change.

7796743,5,1567301614,"Can you take a mostly uneventful plot with more than 90% of ""static conversations"" and make a coherent, intriguing and engaging film to hold the absolute attention of your audience for the entire 3 hours and 40 minutes? In this 1973 black-and-white film,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mother-and-the-Whore-VHS/dp/1567301614/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mother and the Whore [VHS</a>]  (La Maman et la Putain in French), Jean Eustache and his team achieved all these and more. For me, this is a masterpiece, an overwhelming experience comparable to Franois Truffaut's The 400 Blows.

Indeed, the reference to The 400 Blows is not merely coincidence. The lead actor Jean-Pierre Laud, playing Alexandre here, began his distinguished career as Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's debut film 14 years ago. Alexandre was involved in the May 1968 Movement in France, a defining event for many in his generation. The film's story happens over a period of a few days in the summer of 1972 in Paris. At his late 20s Alexandre is an unemployed young man living in with a boutique owner Marie (Bernadette Lafont). He picked up a Polish nurse Veronika (Franoise Lebrun)(*1) at the caf Les Deux Magots after an unsuccessful marriage proposal to a former love, Gilberte (Isabelle Weingarten). Three of them are then entangled in a promiscuous triangle affair.

If the plot reads like a melodrama, it is. Alexandre is an obsessive talker, a pseudo intellectual who loves to hear himself talk about everything, from mundane jokes to personal fantasies, with references to Marcel Proust (Alexandre often holds a volume of In Search of Lost Time in caf Flores), Robert Bresson (Weingarten appeared previously in Bresson's film Four Nights of a Dreamer (1971)) and Jean-Paul Sartre (in Les Deux Magots). The entire film is comprised mostly of conversations, with music playing occasional but important transitions. (Music includes Jacques Offenbach's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Belle-Hlne/dp/B0001EQI06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Belle Hlne</a>&nbsp;and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem/dp/B000003D1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem</a>, together with other pop music and French chansons which I am not familiar with.) On top of that, there is no poetic editing (a la Alain Resnais or Ingmar Bergman)(*2), no spectacular shots (a la Orson Welles), no deliberate grittiness often associated to independent productions (a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Cassavetes/dp/B0002JP2OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Cassavetes</a>). If this sounds like a recipe for failure, Eustache somehow magically holds everything together magnificently. In fact, I must assume that these lengthy conversations are distilled from Eustache's own life experience, as it just seems well-neigh impossible to have created out of thin air 3 hours worth of very diverse conversations. (Eustache writes the film script himself.) I imagine that one has to spend many years to collect these from ""interesting"" parties filled with (pseudo) intellectuals! Often a conversation is not particularly interesting on its own, but it contributes subtly to the whole and forms a part of an engaging experience.

When this film was first screened in Cannes Film Festival in May 1973, it created some sort of scandal due to the ""obscenity"" and ""immorality"" of the contents. In spite of that, it won Grand Prix Spcial du Jury and Fipresci (International Critics) Prize. Today, 40 years later, the ""scandalous scenes"" are no longer so shocking. It is still relevant to us, not (only) because of its message, but mostly because it excels on purely cinematic ground. The acting from the lead performers are excellent. Laud, in particular, outdoes himself in The 400 Blows and personifies Alexandre. However, I feel the auteur Jean Eustache is the main force behind this magnificent success.(*3) As mentioned above, the cinematography, composition and editing are unpretentious. They serve the film rather than attract attention to themselves. Each scene can stand on its own as a vignette, but the seemingly loosely organized storyline actually forms a coherent structure, leading to the climactic monologue by Veronika. It's a great loss of humanity that Eustache only made 2 feature films. (His 1974 film, Mes petites amoureuses lasts 123 minutes according to IMDB and wikipedia, although the version I watched was just under 2 hours, perhaps due to ""PAL speedup"".)

---
The VHS quality is, well, like what you would expect of VHS. The details, colors, contrasts leave a lot to be desired in this New Yorker Film release. I had previously emailed Criterion Collection to suggest this film, but no success so far for CC to answer my request! I hope some day a good transfer for home video formats will be available. (In fact, as far as I know, this film has only appeared once as Japanese DVD, which is unfortunately out of print.(*4) In the meantime, anyone who is interested in film should either get the VHS or take any chance to see this film when it is shown in your area. This film deserves to be watched multiple times. It reveals more depth with each re-viewing, a hallmark of a masterpiece.

Highest recommendation!

(*1) Lebrun was Eustache's former lover.
(*2) In fact, Eustache's constant ""fade-out"" instead of cuts could have easily infuriated the French new wave pioneers! :)
(*3) Eustache can be seen in a cameo in the supermarket scene as Gilberte's fianc, when Alexandre's shopping cart bumps into his.
(*4) Rumor has it that Eustache's descendants are asking a prohibitively high price for the rights. However, I don't know a reliable source to confirm this.",1369785600,4,5852,5.67351598173516
7796744,5,1567301614,"Just finished this dark masterpiece for the 2nd time and have to express some thoughts on it. First viewing was a huge thing, a most impressive experience it was. It's message or as much of it as I grasped is a kind of message rarely expressed with such weight and with such seriousness in movies (Perhaps I'm wrong here, so many to see so little time). From the sequence of the lady's monologue to the last moments built up like some primordial volcano, a raging against loose societal norms perhaps is the kind of vibe I felt. This 2nd time I understood more of what was happening up to that wonderfully savage monologue, the behaviors of the characters weren't such a mystery hence, but still explosive. I'd love to see some legal resolutions happen so that more of Jean Eustache's films can be made available, for as gritty and uncompromising as it is it can't be because of that that it's been kept from the DVD market for so long.",1365984000,,936,4.511764705882353
7796745,5,1567301614,"I first got to see ""La maman et la putain"" (""The Mother and the Whore""), many many years ago (sadly, there still isn't a DVD release. Why?). Anyway, after seeing some of the reviews (especially the two lone dopey-reviewers that obviously have no concept of Cinema!), I just had to add my own take on this cinematic masterpiece. ""La maman et la putain"" is from 1973 and was directed by Jean Eustache. I think what most people missed here, was the premise to the whole thing, which is really key and essential to understanding the overall story. This was simply an analysis of the French student uprising of 1968 (Jean-Pierre Leaud's character of 'Alexandre' literally exemplified this), and the impact of that generation on French society and the world for that matter. Like all movements, ideologies become complacent and fall apart, resulting in disillusionment, theirs was no different. The characters of 'Marie' (Bernadette Lafont) and 'Veronika' (Francoise Lebrun), represented freedom and change and an openness to change ('Marie' was the past, 'Veronika' the present and future). The whole film concerned itself (the film was very experimental), with questioning the human condition, from a sociopolitical perspective anyway. The dialogue and scenes were so realistic, you felt like a part of this exercise (it seemed like most of the dialogue was improvised, and the takes were in real-time and not edited down to please public tastes). The acting too, seemed natural and simplistic as possible, the actors really opened up and gave of themselves completely. Some will say, that the whole thing came across a little superficial and pretentious. That's the point, most intellectuals are superficial, but the women were anything but that! They were real, and a big contrast to the all-male posturing that is responsible for so many of the world's problems (although some women can definitely fall into that category as well). This film had some of the most intelligent lines I have ever had the pleasure of hearing! Jean-Pierre Leaud is one lucky guy, to have been able to participate in so many landmark films. On second viewing I got so much more, and even its long running time did not wear me down. I was enthralled and fixated on these characters (the transitions were done with fade outs, instead of being conventional the film was ahead of its time). The openness of the film on so many subjects, but especially on 'sex', really spelled it out for me. This is undoubtedly one of the most important films of the 70's (or any era for that matter), that you will ever see. One more thing, Bernadette Lafont after Annie Girardot, is my favorite French actress of all-time. I simply adore her, too bad she is not better known in the U.S. The picture quality on both VHS tapes (2 parts) from New Yorker Films was excellent. NTSC, French language (English subtitles), NR 208 mins.  (BTW: There is female full-frontal nudity and very open and frank discussions about sex and other topics, that will embarrass and shame the Hollywood 'movie business'!)

7796746,2,1567301614,"The movie can be described as ""several days in the lives of a nymphomaniac, a sucker, and a satyr/gigolo"". Between their sordid sexual romps in squalid rooms with various people, the three sit (endlessly it seems) boozing and smoking and soliloquizing about sex, and life, death, and themselves--just to hear themselves talk. If they were at least good-looking (they are plain)! Don't they have anything to do with their lives? No ambitions? No purpose? How about finding a job, Alexander, and stopping borrowing money from your sucker girlfriend? And why should anyone care about these runting losers?

PS: I don't give this one star because the story, such as it is, is not buried in flashbacks and the camera does not endlessly blur and swing around. Thank God for little favors!",1339459200,,782,4.969465648854962
7796747,5,1567301614,"I am watching 'La maman et la putain', I think for the third or fourth time. I don't want to say it's a 'great' film, because the only sure meaning of great is big: I prefer to say it's a true film.

It's the story of lost souls. Should there be an afterlife it will have a heaven and a hell, but it will also have a city of lost souls. And, you know, heaven will be sparsely populated, hell will be almost empty (the ultimate punishment) but the city of lost souls will be crowded, that's where most of us will be (already are?).

The film tells of some almost meaningless events in the life of three characters who, by chance, have interacted with each other in the Paris of the 1970s. They've all long since ceased to ask for meaning, even the delusional meaning of love. The film starts and ends with a proposal of marriage, and both proposals are robbed of their conventional purpose, standing for something else entirely which it takes the whole film to explain. Two women, Veronika and Marie, have the defense of sex; the man, Alexandre, has the defense of rhetoric. A woman's rhetoric turns sex into love: a man's emotional needs turn despair into philosophy. In an amusing scene towards the middle of the film the men see Sartre in a caf and theorise his philosophy is devised to obscure the fact he's a drunkard.

Jean Eustache, one of cinema's most extraordinary film makers, was neglected in his lifetime. He was too extraordinary. In a moment of frustration, after being immobilised for months following an accident, he took his own life, long before he could realise his promise of being a major film maker. And so he became one of his own characters, like the girl with the bandaged hand who has murdered her lover, a pretended priest, and complains to Alexandre of the jealousy of her current lover.

'The mother and the whore' might seem a feminist's point of view on the roles men assign to women (you know them: virgin, mother, whore, sybil). What woman doesn't feel frustrated with the choice when she's, damn it, only a woman and just like a man she only wants someone to love. But the three main characters, and many of the minor ones, are painted warts and all. The film is broader in scope than feminism, for it embraces despair. This is a condition far more prevalent in men.

For anyone who has watched Jean-Pierre Leaud in the charming and utterly frivolous films of Franois Truffaut (who was the author of the unrealistic 'auteur' theory of film making), his performance in this film is a revelation. Here is exactly the same persona, the same mannerisms, given a touch of profundity by a kind of existential honesty quite foreign to Truffaut. Perhaps stardom helped Leaud to reach this state, this elevation of the image and neglect of its content. Bernadette Lafont has a number of great roles in her repertoire; she gives a powerful performance. The surprise is Franoise Lebrun, playing Veronika. Lebrun hadn't acted before; her performance has to be seen to be believed. The magician here is surely Eustache. His script and his direction must have touched something deep within his actors. The film pulls no punches; it is an honest film. And who isn't disturbed and frightened by honesty?

The story is that events and anecdote in the film come straight from Eustache's life. He had an affair with Lebrun, who left him. He wanted to tell this story, with Lebrun and Leaud in the parts. He said that without their involvement the film would not have been made. Every inconsequential happening and statement in the film is based on fact. This is the source of its achievement and yet completely irrelevant.

What is relevant is that this story of people who have lost something important and can't remember what it is can mean something to all of us in the same sorry state. After all, a world without meaning can be endured, with the help of sex, alcohol, television, the internet. Merely to depict this state would be only sentimental. Eustache does more. Just as Gilgamesh battled death futilely yet achieved immortality, 'The mother and the whore' shows us that confronting despair with honesty gives hope. The characters in the film don't feel this: the viewers do.

Eustache was a documentary film maker, as Kieslowski was, and the Kieslowski of 'Dekalog' is a useful comparison. Where Kieslowski looks at the morality of despair, how to function honestly in a life where we don't know the rules of the game, Eustache in this film is taking things a step further, looking at how we behave when we lose our faith. After all, most causes are subverted. Alexandre has seen the student movement of '68 fizzle out, a devastating blow to him, and his generation. He's seen the Black Panther movement become just a news story (people just a few years ago would have seen the same thing happen with punk, hip-hop, rap).

Veronika has a speech towards the end of 'The mother and the whore' that viewers are not likely to forget. Sex is how she gets by, and all the accumulated resentment she has comes forth in a tirade that has the bitter pathos of a little girl in a tantrum explaining why she wants an ice cream NOW.

Three and a half hours of epigrammatic French conversation in black and white photography might sound as stimulating to most as internet pornography. The only suggestion I can make is that you pay attention to what the characters do NOT say. And you can only do this by referring the spoken and unspoken conversation to your own life. As Samuel Becket makes one of his characters say: ""I can't go on: I must go on"". None of us has any choice at all. Our free will consists only of accepting or ignoring this.

A very moving love story, magnificently acted and directed with power and great originality. The story of a man who can only love the shattered mirror images of a woman and who has no idea of the reflection's original. And a story, rare in cinema, of the painful process of living. I would rate it as a masterpiece.",1224374400,5,5974,4.626415094339623

7796749,5,1567301614,"Ok, what more can I add to the comments already given in the reviews? Besides the fact that one could write a whole book about the richness and diversity of this film, not much, if one has only a few lines to express the joy and wonder, the lust for life one can get from spending a few hours watching a movie.

I saw the film the second time in my life today in the cinema, and while it hadn't the same impact as the first, whith such a flm this hasn't much to say.

One of the greatest film of all times, by all means try and see it if you ever get a chance!

And to see more of the greatness of Eustache, watch his second feature ""Mes petites amoureuses"", which is as good as ""the mother and the whore"" but has on top of that one of the best camerawork I have seen on screen (by Nestor Almendros).

Eustache's films should really be better known, but so should be the films of lots of other great directors (e.g. Sarunas Bartas, Ken McMullen), and I'm happy, that at least one of his films is available on Video.

Hopefully there will be some DVD editions in the future, so that a broader audience will have access to these gems.",1122508800,9,1132,4.127272727272727
