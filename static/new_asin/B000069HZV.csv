1735238,5,B000069HZV,"Since everybody and his brother is out reviewing the recent re-release of Hard Day's Night (including people who cannot tell John from Paul!) I thought I'd review Richard Lester's other great film instead.
Richard Lester obviously learned to tell a joke at the knee of Spike Milligan. It's a shame that the television shows he directed for Milligan (and Peter Sellers) in the 1950s haven't survived the BBC's notorious indifference to posterity.  This makes it even more important that MGM has again made available this film that is now so politically incorrect I long ago concluded it was being surpressed.
This film won the Palm d'Or (best picture) at Cannes in 1965.  It has more brilliant silent sight gags than most any three Buster Keaton pictures combined yet has so much verbal wit that you'll likely be back to watch the film at least three times, just to make sure you really got it all, which I'm not certain is really possible.  The running commentary on youth by the older generation is one of the most hilarious things I've ever heard (and I am amazed I've never seen anyone steal the idea for a lesser picture.)  Listen carefully to the broken dialog in the teacher's lounge where a spinsterish teacher worries no one wants to rape her and a boorish old male teacher reminisces over once hitting an unruly student right up the nose with a piece of chalk.  The sight gags are more obvious, usually broad though occasionally subtle, with large parts of the film having no dialog at all, such as the sequence pushing the old bed frame across London, the sequence with which the film is most frequently identified (note that the bed turns white when they get pulled through a car wash).
The film is politically incorrect from the first shots of all the identically dressed girls queued up the stairs waiting for their turn in Tolin's (Ray Brooks) room. (Tolin has guestbook in his room and asks women to keep their comments to a single word).  School teacher Colin (Michael Crawford) is obsessed that he will end up one of the dirty old men who hang around the school yard to watch the little girls play sports.  Tolin offers to let frustrated Colin share his girls if Colin, who owns the house, will rent the empty room downstairs to Tolin's ladykiller friend, Rory, with everyone sharing in all the girls (we never do see Rory in the film but his presence keeps popping up in important ways).  Before Tolin can move in his friend, however, a stranger, Tom (Donal Donnelly), a painter who paints white everything he sees, moves into the room on his own initiative.  Releaved at not being drawn into the sex deal, but still wanting the knack of getting girls, Colin decides that his real problem is the size of his bed.  Meanwhile, in the other story line, innocent Nancy (Rita Tushingham) has just arrived in London, where, in one of the film's best sight gags, she soon gets an educating eyeful from a prostitute working the photography booth trade.  Nancy has further adventures trying to find the YWCA, including a very funny sequence in a dress shop where a salesman gives the same seductive spiel to each customer, various silent gags involving getting around the streets, and a very strange encounter in a phone booth with a man taking a call about Rory.  Finally, she encounters Colin and Tom out acquiring a large old bed, that Colin likes because of the noise it makes.  The three roll the bed back to the house across London.  But back at the house Tolin quickly puts the moves on Nancy just to show Colin how its done.  And then it all gets even more politically incorrect in a hurry so I'll leave the rest for those who watch the film.  Let's just say it has a nicely moral ending even if the commentary from the older generation disagrees (there are things on their clothes line you wouldn't expect from three young lads).
Another review on Amazon describes the film as anarchic but I think that misses it.  The jokes do come very fast and there are some decidely surreal sequences, some very stylish editing, and the occasional interupting fantasy.  Yet somehow nothing ever seems so silly or outrageous that you completely lose some sense of reality.  In this sense it is more Hard Day's Night than Holy Grail.
The picture and sound quality of the DVD are very good despite the picture's age.  There is obviously a small amount of cropping of the original picture taking place though the aspect ratio is said to be the original 1.66:1.  The DVD provides no extras beyond it's very entertaining trailer.  Since the idiots at Mirimax didn't include Lester's Running, Jumping, Standing Still film on the new Hard Day's Night double DVD set, when it was on the earlier cheapo DVD release, it would have been awfully nice for MGM to include it here.",1033689600,9,4771,4.675029868578256
1735239,5,B000069HZV,"i first saw this film back in the mid 80's. i was in high school then. i remember not really ""getting"" the film, but that i really enjoyed it, especially the music, the fashion, and the energy. i saw it that one time (on pbs, believe it or not) and i had been looking for this film for a long time. i'd forgoten about it until recently. now that i finally have my own copy, i can see that i didn't ""get"" it the first time because it was all just some energetic mod absurdity! this film is so much fun....impress all your hipster friends and get this film. if you're a fan of quadrophenia, to sir with love, or a hard days night (richard lester directed this film and that famous beatle one) you must add this to your collection! this needs to be on DVD!",1006128000,5,753,4.129251700680272
1735240,5,B000069HZV,"This movie is great in the grand sense of the word. The cast is superb, the gags are funny, and it is among the most stylish films I've ever seen. Other reasons to see it:
1) Rita Tushingham stars---Tushingham is gorgeous in an unconventional way, and is known for being a gay icon---the first leading lady who preferred the company of gay men over straight.
2) A young Michael Crawford in a hilarious performance
3) Swinging London portrayed in a non-cliched manner.
4) The film in its entirety (cast, script, setting, cinematography and wardrobe)is more ""hip"" and avant-garde than anything I've ever seen---and it was done forty years ago.
If you are a fan of smart comedy, hip fashion and lifestyles, or just great cult films, you must have it. If you are none of these, you probably won't get. Let it be known---Lester, who is known most for A Hard Day's Night, surpassed that film tenfold in making The Knack...and How To Get It.",1004832000,9,934,4.666666666666667
1735241,5,B000069HZV,"This film, from Richard (A Hard Day's Night) Lester, is a black and white, darkly hilarious comedy about sexuality and relationships in 1960s England. The filmmaking is anarchic and brilliantly edited; it looks modern compared to films of today, even thought its influence is not widely known. Lester is working at the height of his ability here, and ""The Knack...and how to get it"" stands as his greastest achievement in a long and varied career. It's fun and the performances, though all comically exaggerated, are top-notch.
I bought the video on a whim, and I consider it a great investment in any video collection of experimental, obscure films.

1735284,2,B000069HZV,"Blimey!  While this Richard (the Beatles! the Musketeers! Robin and Marian!) Lester film is chock full of period slang and locations and fashions, it utterly fails to captivate this modern viewer.  I was disappointed when I finally saw this so-called classic. It's not one of Lester's stellar  offerings and has not aged well at all compared to his best work.

The scattershot, nonsequitur script, based on a play,  is painfully plotless and artless and a good cast strives to bring some life to an overbearing series of gags, puns, clever cuts,  and sheer dada nonsense.  Many of these faces are familiar from other Lester movies (the Beatles' flicks; the similar but superior ""How I Won the War"") and English cinema of the time but here they flail and play to type in a most dismal fashion (despite the splendid mid-Sixties fashions).  There is no rhythm or pulse to the movie, just a bunch of blokes and birds thrashing about aimlessly. I watched the clock for the entire running time, and none more so than the last thirty minutes, when the subject of rape (yes, rape; date rape, basically; ""no means yes"" and how all women want it and all men will do it at the drop of a trouser leg) is treated as a comic foil and punchline for an interminable last act.  It's ghastly, and shocking to see something so gauche and juvenile and crass and tasteless, not to say offensive,  from a filmmaker normally more classy and sensible.",1378771200,2,1427,4.672
1735285,2,B000069HZV,"Some fine performances, sets, cinematography and amusing sequences. Sandwiched within the naive and frivolous fun, though, is a vile disrespect for women that goes even beyond what was routine in the cinema of the time. That Rita Tushingham nearly manages to pull off her character credibly is a credit to her talent.",1322092800,4,317,5.115384615384615
1735286,5,B000069HZV,"'The Knack' is a mood piece centering on the hapless Colin (played by a young Michael Crawford), who watches the succession of women flowing in and out of his flatmate's (Ray Brooks) bedroom with awe and dismay.  Colin, a maths teacher, attributes his lack of success with women to his 'late starting' and his narrow bed, but the audience sees how dismayed Colin is by the casual attitudes to sex emerging in the 60s.  As much as he appears to stagger his way through a fog of lust, Colin is desperate for intimacy, not merely sex.  He finds this in the naive but quirky fresh face (Rita Tushingham), who is at first flattered by the attentions of Tolen, but eventually realizes his flash affectations mask an alarming lack of substance.  Directed by Dick Lester ('A Hard Day's Night'), 'The Knack' is at first glance light-hearted, but beneath that simplicity is a story replete with all the angst and uncertainty of youth, and the secret longing to recapture innocence.  Michael Crawford is particularly wonderful, his intensity is almost heart-breaking in his quest to be taken seriously.",1297382400,2,1091,4.875675675675676
1735287,3,B000069HZV,"Forty years on the once scintillating British comedies of Richard Lester have lost a lot of their fizz. Even ""A Hard Day's Night,"" though buoyed by the Beatles and their tunes, seems a little tired and old-fashioned. ""The Knack,"" which Lester did a few years later, uses the same tricks: madcap antics, irreverent humor, verbal nonsense (that somewhat foreshadows Monty Python), quick-cut editing, cute locations and such. Though based on a play, the film is long on style and attitude and short on plot. Nerd (Michael Crawford) envies a stud (Ray Brooks) with a ""knack"" with the ladies. Along comes Nancy (Rita Tushingham), a sort of everywoman, and the tussle for her begins. Oh, and there's daft painter about, a sort of revisitation of Gulley Jimpson, adding to the chaos. The picture captures the mood of mod '60s London pretty well, and David Watkin's black and white photography and Lester's visuals are striking. And to top it off, there's John Barry's rather famous score for organ and jazz orchestra, probably one of his best. Most of the fizz that's left is there.",1122249600,10,1075,4.912087912087912
1735288,2,B000069HZV,"This movie is of its time and has not aged well.  It's a not very vivid portrayal of the swinging sixties in London, with four  uninvolving characters spewing bizarre non-sequiturs at one another.  Watch it with the subtitles off and you'll think it doesn't make sense; watch it with the subtitles on and you'll realize it's not supposed to make sense.  In neither case is it at all funny.  The film also betrays its origins as a play; despite the best efforts of the director to open it up - he spends about five wordless minutes showing three of the characters rolling a brass bed through London - it feels stagebound.

What's good about it is the John Barry score.  The first dreamlike scene in which the music spirals around and around a bevy of beautiful girls is worth seeing.  I also enjoyed the random comments of the disapproving older English observing the wacky doings of the the ""mods"" and the ""rockers,"" though only one of the characters is a mod; none are rockers.  Most importantly, none are interesting.

Avoid the movie; buy the soundtrack.  If you want a vivid movie portrayal of London in the 1960's watch Michael Caine's ""Alfie"".",1115424000,7,1149,4.666666666666667
1735289,3,B000069HZV,"Forty years after its release, it's hard to imagine how new and fresh this film was. Borrowing heavily from the French New Wave in terms of look and feel, the film and its inseperable and sublime John Barry soundtrack are a fascinating snapshot of the so-called swinging sixties in London.

Whilst The Knack has some stunning elements all captured beautifully on the otherwise feature free DVD - the stark black and white photography, the white on white decor of the downstairs flat and the views of London (somehow familiar yet quite alien) the film is not what it was.

Perhaps it's original uniqueness has been copied or pastiched so many times that the film is now a cliche. Scenes of 'wacky' youth leaping around in the street is a bit cringe inducing, while the scenes where Tolen tries to enamour himself of Nancy  and the ""Rape"" last act are downright disturbing.

For fans of the movie's director Dick Lester the Knack is closer to A Hard Day's Night than Help and like those films it has a cool soundtrack.

It's a shame that the DVD didn't have a bit more to offer - there isn't even a trailer - something the soundtrack included when issued as an enhanced CD

Ultimately The Knack is essential viewing for those interested in Sixties London and how young some of the actors look - (check out early performances from Jacqueline Bisset and one time John Barry squeeze Jane Birkin).

1735290,3,B000069HZV,"""The Knack...and How to Get It"" is a moderately engaging comedy about a young teacher/landlord(Michael Crawford) who is envious of his tenant's(Ray Brooks) ability to woo women effortlessly.  The object of their mutual affection is a young sweet-faced girl (Rita Tushingham) new to London.  Donal Donnelly, as an artist, makes an amusing contribution to the film.  All the primary actors, for that matter, deliver good work here.  The black-and-white photography of swinging London is gorgeous.  As are most of the ""birds"" in the movie.  My problem is probably with the story-telling style that director Richard Lester employs here.  He achieved great success with this avante-garde approach with the Beatles in ""A Hard Days' Night"" and to a lesser extent with ""Help!"".  Here it seems dizzying and confusing and it's not helped with the heavy use of British vernacular.  I recommend this film for anyone who is interested in the work of Lester or hopeless anglophiles.",1099008000,2,968,5.193548387096774
1735291,4,B000069HZV,"This 1965 Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or winner still looks innovative nearly 40 years after it was made.  The John Barry soundtrack used throughout the movie is outstanding.  This film is not to be missed by those who love the 1960s and the films made during that decade.
The story started out as a play by Ann Jellicoe.  The film shifts between broad slapstick and avant-garde as it tells the story of an unlucky in love schoolteacher, his womanizing housemate, the artist who moves in with them, and a naive girl who has just arrived in London.
Director Richard Lester uses all kinds of editing shots that still look fresh and there's something about this film being in black and white that somehow makes it more ""1960s"" than if it had been shot in color.
MGM released this in widescreen with the theatrical trailer but it really could use some extras where the making of the film is discussed.  (Check out the liner notes on the CD soundtrack for some behind the scenes information.)  Audio commentary from Richard Lester and any of the actors would have also been much appreciated.",1041033600,10,1086,4.6947368421052635
1735292,5,B000069HZV,"...So Tom tells us about half way through ""The Knack...and how to get it"".  Whether he speaks for the other characters or for humanity as a whole the viewers have to decide for themselves but it is just the sort of thing that keeps you guessing in this amazing film.
When someone askes me to name my favourite film I usually say ""The Knack...and how to get it"" which is almost always met with a puzzled look in responce; so few people have seen this movie, even though it won the main prize at Cannes the year it was made and was a popular and commercial success across the world, that you might be forgiven for thinking that perhaps it had been surpressed or maybe overtaken by fashion that lumped all the ""Swinging London"" films together and forgot them.  Either way I think it is a neglected clasic that deserves wider recognision.
Taken from a not very successful play by Ann Jellicoe, that ran at the Royal Court experimental theatre for six weeks about a year before it was filmed, Charles Wood's screenplay expanded the action away from the run-down house, which is at the centre of the play, to use London as the backdrop for the film; not tourist London but the back streets and slightly run down areas of Shepherd's Bush.  The true masterstoke was to give the running commentary by the old people on what the four main (young) characters are up to.  This babble is so typical of the British attitude to sex sensorious, but at the same time obsessed  and slightly regretting that they haven't done it themselves that it is hillarious. This aspect of the film is clearly influenced by Dylan Thomas' ""Under Milk Wood"" but used here it takes on it's own identity. Charles Wood also has a small part in the film himself; he is one of the Guardsmen that Nancy encounters in their ""Bear Skins"" (pun fully intended) while trying to find the YWCA.
The performances by the main actors are all superb.  Michael Crawford as the accident prone, sex starved Colin, living in his run down Victorian house, who careers from one disaster to another is clearly the reletive of Frank Spencer the character Crawford played to such great effect in the 1970's ""Some Mother's Do 'ave 'em"" before he went on to even greater success in West End and Broadway musical theatre.
Ray Brooks delivers a totally beliveable Tolan, the superior, promiscous man living on the top floor of Colin's house who's  self confidence eventually leads to his own downfall. A year after making this Brooks was the male lead in ""Cathy Come Home"", one of the most famous  British television plays of all time, which shocked a nation by graphically showing the full reality of the homeless in the UK. It is difficult to imagine two more contrasting rolls.
Donal Donelly as Tom the manic painter and decorator who acts as the catalyst bringing the other elements of the film together. He was in some other 1960 movies including ""Waterloo"" but I haven't seen him in anything for a very long time now.
Rita Tushingham always has a vulnerability about her and never more so than in this film as Nancy. She arrives in London and wanders haplesly around costantly being mis directed to the YWCA until she comes across Colin and Tom in a junk yard.  As she comes to know the other characters she comes under Tolan's spell until she suddenly finds she is in love with Colin.  Tushingham handles her part well as she develops from the innocent new girl in town to the more confident woman at the end of the picture via a sort of breakdown after which she accuses all and sundry of ""rape"". It is this aspect of the film which has drawn most criticim bringing with it accusations of misogyny.  I don't think that it is justified after all nobody gets raped they just shout it a lot!
John Barry's score brings the whole film together;  He uses a choir of womens voices and the jazz organist Alan Haven, who had previously enlivened the opening titles of ""From Russia With Love"", to a variety of moods with one basic theme in 3/4 time.  It is one of the most creative uses of music I can think of.
Richard Lester directed this gem of a film on location at break neck speed just as he had some months earlier with ""A Hard Day's Night"".  His surreal imagination, sense of humour and love of scilent movies all combine to make one of the most original films ever made.  Using black and white stock allowed him greater freedom to film in awkward locations as well as to experiment with over exposure so what started out as a budget restriction became a creative tool.  There are some wonderful individual shots; at one point, for instance, Colin, Tom and Nancy are seen throwing stones in the river and there is a shot of their reflection it is only there for a few seconds but it is the composition of the film for me. It is rare to find a film which has good dialoge and creative cinamatography.
On DVD the film looks great even with so few extra features.  I was pleased that there were suptitles as some of the lines of dialoge are  a bit indisdinct and even as a native English speaker I've often wondered what they were.
One final thing.  Whenever I'm feeling a bit depressed I often look at this film and it never fails to make me feel better you never know perhaps it will do the same for you.",1034985600,38,5246,4.503157894736842

It not unlike the whimsical British comedy of School for Scoundrels but is light years ahead of filming from the likes of Terry Thomas and Ian Carmichael. The film though is unique and timeless.

Ray Books plays the self confessed womaniser who has a certain success with the ladies: his character is nasty and manipulative his conquest is to seduce women, but will curtail himself from committing rape he will though humiliate his rivals. Starring together, and with ingenious casting, we have a magical formula with Rita Tushingham, and the delightful Donal Donnelly. This will balance into creative comedy that enlightens the film, and will change the status quo in favour of Michael Crawford....

This is Britians very own comedy in 15 cert.  the film has a classic and an iconic feeling in advanced timing. Magic too in black and white filming in the autumn streets of London in the 1960s: it is truly inspired with a jazzy music score by John Barry. The film engages a freshness of living in a cusp of a new generation of imaginative thought: it invigorates and evokes. The film photography is fantastic, and invites us to be there too.

The loveliest part of the film is when a jumbo sized bed is transported across the streets....the buzz of the film also continues when Ray Brooks scooters along with Rita Tushingham in pillion, followed in a chase by Michael Crawford and Donal Donnelly on foot.

On reflection, the charm of comedy may test itself upon the false and comical cry of rape from Rita Tushingham this is strangely funny in itself; but rightfully so, it will frighten the boys to restrain from their promiscuous behaviour in desire towards the opposite sex  they react by dropping leaves in the park and cowering in retreat - this episode is treated light heartedly as the film intends to portray; but may disturb and offend present audiences as it is actually not very far from the truth of today.....

Michael Crawford will win the day by confidence alone- his acting is so remarkably natural, that by the end of the film, we really think he should have been cast in more films as the leading man of heart--throb charm. Ray Brooks, on the other hand -in character of Dolan- will alternatively be cast off into a soulless pit of resentment, along with older people of whom the film seems to reflect in an imagined thought of hostility towards a new generation?

I genuinely love this film -a favourite of mine, and I find it fascinating to watch again, and to enjoy with fun and with freedom of thought: I personally think it is a classic! The film is directed by Richard Lester.

7965883,3,B000069HZV,"This lovely dated movie holds the answer to one of the most enduring Beatles mysteries, to wit: Just how many holes does it take to fill the Albert Hall? John Lennon, who wrote the song, mumbled about something vaguely remembered from a newspaper, but this movie imbeds a better answer.

(Evidence offered: Richard Lester, the director, had just directed ""A Hard Day's Night"" and would next direct ""Help!"")

The film is a fun, slight piece of nonsense unless you're into that Rita Tushingham square-jaw 'n square hair 'n square stare look (sigh...) But it also involves two studs who compete on how many women they can bed. To settle the bet, they invite all their conquests to the Albert Hall.

HENCE: ""Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.""
