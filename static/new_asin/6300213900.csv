236913,3,6300213900,"Slow-moving prison film with Eastwood as Frank Morris, a convict transferred to the hellish Alcatraz from an Atlanta prison. Morris, after standing up to the local prison rapist-to-be, starts to look for a way out.  No one had ever escaped alive from Alcatraz, but he and several cohorts try  to foil the warden and authorities. The movie is by-the-numbers and plods  along, but the authentic locations and Eastwood's force of a personality  lift it a little bit.",963792000,,463,4.974025974025974
236914,4,6300213900,"Since MADIGAN and ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ, two movies directed by Donald Siegel, have been presented these last months in the DVD standard, it would be a good occasion to rediscover this director who gave us such  masterpieces as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE KILLERS.
The plot  of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ isn't the most original story on the subject but  contains a certain number of interesting ideas. Firstly, Richard Tuggle,  the screenwriter, and Donald Siegel have chosen to compare Alcatraz to a  zoo and the prisoners to animals trying to escape from their cages. The  leader of the coloured prisoners compares himself to the king of the apes  and the only newspapers permitted in Alcatraz are of the wildlife  documentary kind.
So you will be amazed by the number of animals a prison  like Alcatraz can hide in his walls : mouses, cockroaches, rats and birds.  They're all here, in front of Siegel's camera, to make us understand the  condition of the prisoners. OK, it's a little bit heavy, symbolically  speaking, but unusual in this kind of movie.
Since the prisoners are  constantly observed, the only way to escape from this prison is to be  present and away in the same time. How ? by imitating the reality with  walls in paper patiently built during the night or by putting mannequins  under their blankets. Another way to escape from Alcatraz is to become mad  . Believe me or not, It's not Clint's choice.
As bonus features, you will  only have a scene access (thank you, thank you, thank you). Sound,  surprisingly, is not as good as images.
A DVD for the beast in you.",959385600,3,1591,4.72

237199,5,6300213900,"Truth often being stranger, and often more interesting, than fiction Eastwood's Escape From Alcatraz plays it mostly straight, and why not since the actual escape had all it needed for a fantastic story.  It only adds to the legend that the open ending is just that.

Escape From Alcatraz is probably the second best prison move, escape or otherwise, after The Shawshank Redemption.  It could have actually been quite plodding and nowhere nearly as great without Eastwood's ""good guy"" toughie.  He makes you root for the cons to escape without breaking a sweat.  Though approached lightly, Patric McGoohan's constant tense portrayal of the heartless warden adds more inhumanity than is actually seen on screen becoming the bad guy outstripping the actual prison bully Wolf who is a murderer itching to add Frank Morris to his body count.  I certainly have enjoyed McGoohan's penchant for creating an enigmatic and cagey charactrer from his The Prisoner British TV series, but in far less screen time he manages to give a equally brilliant edge to Alcatraz.  Finally, credit must be given to director Don Siegel who Eastwood has publically said he learned everything about directing movies from.  Siegel, and writer Robert Finch. wisely steered away from adding bombast allowing the real element of the utterly hopeless incareration on Alcatraz to underpin the excellent performance of the principals.  This movie was stripped down to the essentials, masterfully telling a powerful story which lives on yet today as legend.  Escape From Alcatraz holds up to repeated viewings as an excellent movie actually propelling the legend.  Being available for Amazon Prime made it an easy recommendation which was much appreciated by this viewer.  It's at my list's top of a non-western Eastwood flick without doubt.",1488412800,5,1806,5.211072664359862

237492,4,6300213900,"A nice Eastwood classic, ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is an enjoyable movie about several inmates who attempted to....what else?  Escape.  It's presentation appears somewhat dated because of the pacing and there are less-than-convincing scenes, such as the confrontation between Eastwood's character and the prison bully, that make the movie lose a bit of its impact.

The transfer itself is a solid Blu-ray transfer. Video quality is quite good, though no records are set for either video nor audio quality.  The disc itself is a bare bones item, given that it only contains the movie.  There are no special features.

Still, for the low price you can't complain.",1477958400,,658,5.160377358490566

237807,3,6300213900,"Interesting enuf but...the ever-halting ""but"", it did seem a bit slow & erratic in developing the story. I suppose I held on simply to see how it would play-out. It did speed-up near the end and overall it was ok but I hesitate to recommend it too highly. It doesn't deserve that in my opinion. And too, the story is based on a book that is speculative so it seems somewhat wanting factually. If you like Clint and you're interested in Alcatraz folklore, you might find this satisfying.

The escape plan is so ingenious, the warden is such a self-important and inhumane person.  Tension mounts as the escape plan is threatened by unrelated circumstances.  Luck plays a big part.  The fact that the film is based on a true story adds a great deal.  Casting, performances, pacing and direction are all right on.  Taut and tension filled.

237928,5,6300213900,"Classic Clint Eastwood at his best. Clint is always cool, a man's man, a real thinker and this movie fits him perfectly. I have seen this movie over and over and perhaps Escape From Alcatraz and The Great Escape were the two movies that inspired my three jail breaks from Ventura County jail in 2004, 2006, 2008. I always wanted to do it. I have visited Alcatraz many times since I was a kid and it never gets old. I just love walking around in the prison, on the island and imagining what it was like to be in there and to break out of an unreachable prison. This movie is so authentic, it really takes you there. Prisons today are nothing like this. These were the good old days when men were men and men used there heads to think - kept quiet - knew how to organize - before the convicts were all gang bangers, crack heads and meth tweakers. These were real dangerous men because they knew the code and they lived by it. This is why I believe that they made it off the rock in one piece. They were smart enough to know that they had to disappear forever and leave no tracks unlike the wannabe criminals of today who would get picked up within 30 days partying in all their old spots, getting high and committing more crime or bragging about their escape. This is a must watch. Organizing a jail or prison break is much harder than it sounds. It's like herding cats. Everyone has their own ideas and thinks that they know best.",1464220800,,1429,4.276752767527675
237929,4,6300213900,"Classic that you have to see, especially after visiting Alcatraz Island. You'll notice that the storyline of the movie is pretty similar to what actually happened at Alcatraz. (The Alcatraz tour still shows the paper mache heads in the prison cells)
It's fascinating to hear the theories of where these fugitives went after their escape, and then seeing the movie's perspective of it. (And it still blows my mind that this feat was actually accomplished!)",1464134400,,455,5.08

The whole premise of escape seems pretty preposterous based on how it's executed, but the film is based on a real story of the three men who escaped Alcatraz.

The film looks rather dated on Blu-ray -- probably the best it can look.  Glad Warner licensed this from Paramount and got it out on the format.

Great story and of course the interesting views in and around Alcatraz are very cool to see on Blu-ray now!  The transfer looks good overall though the focus in some scenes isn't quite as sharp as I hoped, but I'm not sure that's the HD or just the original film.  When the Warden finds a painting of himself hidden in Doc's cell, and he suddenly snaps to it and turns on the light, you can see the grain of the canvas behind the paint which looks impressive.  The sound is also very crisp.

There's a lot of language support, too - when you insert the disc it asks you to select between a multitude of language buttons... and the subtitles also work in several languages (English is the 3rd option for captions).  The dialog appears accurate and the CC actually helped me catch a few things here and there that I hadn't completely heard before (mostly thanks to seeing this many times on VHS or grainy SD cable back in the day).",1444953600,8,1024,4.335078534031414

238242,4,6300213900,"Don Siegel's gritty, atmospheric prison drama based of the famous true-life escape. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his finest performances as master bank robbery Frank Morris, a cunning new inmate at The Rock who discovers a way to break out of the inescapable prison. Working with the Anglins brothers John & Clarence, well-played by Frank Ward and Jack Thibeau and Charley Butts, nicely played by Larry Hankin, Morris devises an intricate escape plan involving digging through the corroded concrete of the individual cells, fashioning dummy heads out of papier-mache and creating life rafts out of rubber rain coats. But looming over their carefully crafted plans is the sadistic, cold-hearted warden, played brilliantly by the late Patrick McGoohan, and a murderous gay inmate named Wolf, played memorably by Bruce M. Fisher who intends to kill Morris. Expertly filmed on the actual Alcatraz island prison. Astute direction by Siegel, with striking cinematography by the late great Bruce Surtees. There are exceptional supporting performances by the late Roberts Blossom, Paul Benjamin, and Frank Ronzio. A solid, captivating motion picture.

Escape from Alcatraz portrayed Clint Eastwood's character while incarcerated in prison as a smart, cunning and confident individual. But definitely did not portray himself as arrogant towards the warden and prison guards.  The warden was portrayed as someone that was equally cunning so long as he controlled the upper hand obviously.  However, prisoners knew how to pull off the escape by impeccable timing and a bit of luck and opportunity.

238629,4,6300213900,This is a well made movie based on the famous story of Frank Morris and his accomplices who escaped from the prison on Alcatraz island back in the early 1960's.  It is entertaining and well produced.,1432944000,,199,4.527777777777778
238708,5,6300213900,"If you watch enough stupid commercials -- you know, the ones where the dudes hang out in the ""man cave"" and ""reminisce,"" if reminisce is the right word -- the guys will always watch sports, do high fives, and tell each other ""You da man!"" even though, in reality, none of them are ""da man.""  Of course, nowadays, since the media wants to make men look bad -- and conversely, make women look good -- you'll always see that the white guys are fat and stupid (and usually balding), while if there is a guy with any redeeming qualities, he will always be a minority.  Hey, I don't make the rules, I only observe and report, just like Paul Blart.  Another guy who isn't ""da man,"" even though he's a nice guy.

But if Clint Eastwood were to star in one of these commercials -- he's way too white and he's way too cool and he's way too smart to do that -- and if another actor were to say to him, ""Clint, you're Da Man!"" that other guy would be right!  Mr. Eastwood IS Da Man.  And ""D"" and ""M"" must be capitalized, for effect.  Man, I tell you, Mr. Eastwood has played the good guy, the bad guy, and the ambiguously good-or-bad guy, and he plays all those guys better than any of those other guys.  Heck, he's even cool talking to a chair.  (I would rather talk to a chair than Obama myself, but I digress.)

And in this film, Mr. Eastwood plays kinda the bad guy -- Frank Morris -- but he plays that character straight.  He's not too bad, and he's not too good, just like most people are in the real world, even many criminals.  And I really liked the fact that the guards and warden were pretty mean too, but not TOO mean.  From interviews that I've seen with guards nowadays at San Quentin (yes, a different prison, but right up the bay), supposedly, guards don't want to be mean to prisoners, unless they absolutely have no choice.  Those guards want respect both ways, to make everyone's day easier.  I understand.  When you work with ""Dead Men Walking"" on Death Row, you don't want to become a ""Dead Man Laying"" at the end of the day.  (Or is that ""lying""?  I always struggle with this construction.)

I saw this film not long after it initially released in the theater and liked it.  After watching it again -- digitally remastered for streaming in 1080P -- I loved it this time.  I guess that I've grown to appreciate terrific acting over the years.  No one overplays his hand in this film, in particular Mr. Eastwood.  Watch the subtle movements of Da Man.  He has a real economy of movement here, and it makes sense; if you were in prison, you wouldn't want to bring too much attention to yourself.

Did the prisoners actually make it out alive, something that the warden said was impossible for anyone on ""The Rock""?  Well, maybe, but that's not the point.  The point is:  Clint Eastwood is Da Man.  If he's the good guy; if he's the bad guy; if he's the in-between guy.  He'd be cool even if he died trying.  And he'd be especially cool just talking to a chair.  Something that I'd rather do myself than talk to some people.  Hint hint.

(BTW:  I thought about John Madden while writing this review.  I really miss him as a color commentator; I wish he'd unretire.  But I tried to write this as if he were saying it, although I added my own political leanings.)",1432771200,2,3266,4.33003300330033

238771,4,6300213900,"Not many historical movies have ever been shot in the exact locale of the events that actually took place, which makes ""Escape from Alcatraz"" a unique film experience. The entire film was shot at the real Alcatraz Prison. The cell from which Morris escaped, the ventilator shaft where the escapees trekked from their cells to the rooftop, and finally down vertical piping on the wall to the bay are all areas of the prison. In short, the camera followed the footsteps of the escapees down nearly the exact path they may have taken, the actors crawling, sneaking, and climbing as Morris and his cohorts did almost 20 years before the making of the film.

The most interesting aspect of the film is of course the plans, the ingenuity, and the hard work that went into the escape. The dummy heads, the fake grills, and the raft were all pieces of a larger puzzle designed to not only get them out of Alcatraz, but give them a head start over their captors. This aspect is what makes the film compelling from start to finish. The tools and materials stolen and procured are what allowed the escapees to enact what has become probably the most famous and talked-about prison break in the history of American crime. And the film does an excellent job of showing the many ingenious innovations enacted by the escapees.

Almost as compelling as the logistics of the break is the portrayal of prison life. Given that no film cam substitute for the true experience of prison life, ""Escape from Alcatraz"" may come the closest. In parts, the viewer almost feels like he or she is within the brick and mortar of Alcatraz along with these inmates experiencing the lock-up of lock-ups. People are not terribly friendly. There is no world except the prison. Magazines like ""Boys Life"" are fought over by the inmates. Solitary confinement, or D-Block, is the punishment for transgressions inside the prison, often imposed without a fair hearing. This is prison life at its darkest and loneliest.

There are a few Hollywood embellishments which are to be expected. Clint Eastwood portrays Frank Morris on the relatively positive side, as one who befriends a black inmate, commiserates with a few of the older prisoners, and even cares about some of the lifers. An older inmate is a painter, and another has a pet mouse or rat. Eastwood takes an interest in both characters. And the warden, played with stoic cynicism by Patrick MacGoohan, is cold, heartless, and, at one point, offended by the painter-inmate. The movie is from the inmates' perspective, and most viewers will inevitably take their side and root for the escapees.

The real Frank Morris sounds like he was probably the last person to make friends with many people, let alone those of African-American descent. Based on what little is known about him, he was probably neither sentimental nor caring. What the movie does reveal correctly is that Morris had exceptional intelligence, which allowed him to successfully rob banks and escape from other prisons. It is fun to wonder whether the real Frank Morris ever saw this movie and took pleasure in being portrayed by Clint Eastwood. The portrayal of the other cohorts by Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau as the Anglin brothers was probably more true-to-life. And even if they didn't make it out of the Bay and to freedom, Morris and his partners have been immortalized by this film.

Overall, a great film with exceptional production value, and not to be missed. The portrayal of the shut-in is maybe unequaled in film history, even if the characters were slightly sentimentalized. And the film also reaffirms human beings' knack for attempting the impossible against all odds. And why shouldn't they try to escape? They have nothing to lose.",1431734400,,3733,4.863207547169812

239566,5,6300213900,"This is a stellar movie for several reasons. Clint Eastwood plays the lead role and idoes it in his usual,unique way. Some of the best escape movies have always been memorable. This one takes place in Americas's most secure prison. That is not debatable, as in its 29 years operation, there have been no successful escapes. This is not a fictional story as the prisoners who were attempting to escape were real prisoners and they actually were successful in escaping from the confines of the prison. However;whether or not they were successful in conquering the extremely cold and treacherous waters surrounding the island of Alcatraz,remains unknown.
 The method they used to escape was really what they planned and executed. The only difference was that it took them about 2 years,somewhat longer than the movie implies. Another thing that was not exactly true was the racial  interplay between Morris and a black prisoner. There was also a situation in the yard where a prisoner told Morris his name was Al Capone. In fact Capone had been released from Alcatraz on Jan 6,1939. Maybe that prisoner was just joking.

 Alcatraz ,is America's most famous prison in spite of its short years of operation. This movie was based on the book ""Escape from Alcatraz"" by John Bruce Campbell. Another interesting book is ""Breaking the Rock"" by Jolene Babyak,who actually lived on Alcatraz ,as a daughter of an assistant warden. There are many other good books about Alcatraz and the criminals who did time there.
 An interesting book and movie,starring Burt Landcaster, is the ""The Birdman Of Alcatraz"" ,about Robert Stroud. He in fact, did a great deal of work on the treatment of bird diseases. However; he did all this work at Leavenworth,not Alcatraz. He was transferred from Leavenworth and spent his final years in Alcatraz,but the warden refused to allow him to carry on with his work there. Stroud actually wrote the definitive book on the treatment of bird diseases and also wrote many articles in popular bird magazines under an assumed name;all from prison.",1422662400,,2058,4.988338192419825

239649,5,6300213900,GREAT MOVIE,1420588800,,11,5.0
239650,2,6300213900,"The dialogue is geared to inform the uninitiated about the conditions in Alcatraz and the impossibility of escape. The story line is sympathetic to the plight of the prisoners, but ignores to a great extent their cruelty and evilness, which landed them in prison in the first place. Many of Clint Eastwood's lines are basic one liners, much in the spirit of his other tough guy roles. The depictions of life in Alcatraz have a measure of accuracy and other aspects had to be abbreviated for the movie, which is understandable. But everything falls short. Everything is simplified to the ABCs of life in prison and the planning for the escape. Particularly disappointing is how, after making a few observations, Clint Eastwood wakes up one day, goes to the mess hall and explains to his accomplices a fully hatched plan, complete with details. This is unbelievable. Then in another scene, he has a nasty exchange with the warden about the warden's decision to take away an inmate's painting privilege. Somehow and without explanation, Eastwood's character discerns that the warden did not like something that the inmate had painted, but in the corresponding scene, the warden is by himself in the prisoner's cell with no witnesses.
The only thing that I like about this movie is how one gets some idea of what the prison looked like while it was in operation. Even though the details of the escape are for the most part accurate, the treatment and story line is simplified way too much, to the point of childishness.",1420243200,,1515,4.853281853281853

Several movies were mentioned and we decided to watch Escape from Alcatraz because it was based on an actual escape. The movie is a little old fashioned according to modern tastes that run to special effects and larger than life characters. We both enjoyed the movie very much. It seemed plausible and showed the ""mechanics"" of the escape very well. The warden was very mean and some of the inmates seemed perhaps too nice. After all the modern portrayals loud-mouthed, screeching, sexually aggressive, super violent, psychopathic prisoners we see on T.V. and in movies nowadays, these criminals seemed a bit tame.",1409961600,4,733,5.066115702479339

240130,5,6300213900,"Who doesn't love a good prison break?  Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I sure do.  And best of all, this escape actually happened.  Frank Morris, played by Clint Eastwood, plans a daring breakout from the country's most secure maximum security prison.  He recruits old friends John Anglin, played by Fred Ward, and John's brother, Clarence Anglin, played by Jack Thibeau, and new friend Charlie Butts, played by Larry Hankin and based on real-life Alcatraz prisoner Allen West, in his preparations as they set out to not only escape from the facility but to delay anyone realizing that they were gone, giving themselves a longer head start.  While a few (very few) changes were made under the name of ""artistic license"", this is a film that can be enjoyed as much today as it was back when it came out in 1979.  I think filming on the real Alcatraz Island helped, but a lot of credit goes to the actors and filmmakers as well.  It can't have been easy to shoot this, whether on a studio set or in the real place.  All of the inmates were convincing in their roles, whether major or minor.  The escape plan, which remained unchanged from real events, was creative and kept my attention.  This is a film that will surely continue to be enjoyed for years to come.  Watch it!  Enjoy.",1402617600,,1289,4.556521739130435

I'm not ordinary a Clint Eastwood fan, but he does do a great job here playing mastermind Morris who is determined to break out of the Rock (Alcatraz's nickname). He keeps his eyes and ears open, and most importantly, keeps it cool.

Patrick McGoohan plays the hard-nosed warden, subtle yet can be vindictive when he wants to be (he has one inmate's painting privileges taken away after discovering a portrait of himself in the inmate's cell). He practically dares Morris to try and escape when he says no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz alive and no one ever will. Again, it's still unknown whether the warden was right or wrong.

240813,4,6300213900,"This is certainly a fascinating story, and it seems the facts were closely adhered to, but it needed a bit more zing.

Here's the scoop. Frank Morris (Eastwood) is a career criminal sent to Alcatraz. He has an I.Q. of 133 and has broken out of other prisons. The warden (McGoohan) is a rotten egomaniac and lectures Morris that he won't escape Alcatraz. Right! Morris gets together with a few other inmates and devises a plan to escape. It works.

This is a good, solid effort with Don Siegel at the helm. The writing is decent as is the acting. Having read the account of the escape, they did seem to have stuck closely to the facts but that might be the problem. The plan was well thought out and the perps didn't seem to rush things. They were going to take their time and get it right which they did, so it seems the writers needed to do a few things to up the tension. These were small parts of the film but they stuck out. I'd have to think how else this could have been handled, and it might have made for a real boring movie were they not inserted, but they just seemed so obviously manufactured.

Be that as it may, this is still a steady watch. It moves like clockwork and I wasn't bored in the least. Eastwood has his usual great screen presence and everyone else on hand did a fine job.

240957,4,6300213900,"1979's ""Escape from Alcatraz"" is a surprisingly good and genuinely suspenseful thriller starring Clint Eastwood, Fred Ward, and Patrick McGoohan.  The premise was the real-life, and still unresolved, escape of three inmates from the Alcatraz maximum security prison in 1962.

""Escape from Alcatraz"", filmed on location in the refurbished prison on Alcatraz Island, effectively recreates the cheerless and claustrophic atmosphere of a tough prison for tough criminals.  Eastwood plays Frank Morris, an inmate who discovers a possible way to escape.  he enlists the aid of three other convicts, including John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau).  The movie closely tracks the nail-biting suspense as Morris and the Anglin brothers make their preparations under the noses of the prison guards.  Their break for freedom depends on minute by minute execution of a difficult escape plot, including surviving the cold waters of San Francisco Bay.

Veteran director Don Siegal populates the prison with an unfeeling warden (a menacing and cynical McGoohan) and a collection of eccentric and sometimes vicious criminals.  The action of the movie is held strictly to the island and the need to escape; there are no distracting side stories from outside the world of confinement.  The ending is nicely ambiguous; viewers can draw their own conclusions. ""Escape from Alcatraz: is highly recommended to Clint Eastwood fans.",1333152000,,1424,5.465753424657534

241103,3,6300213900,"There are many reviews of this movie here that are quite odd. I haven't seen so many zero ratings by other readers for the reviews as in ""Helpful"" or not. Many of them appear to have been written by teenagers. They are short and don't say much at all.

As escape movies go, this one is okay, but using them as for comparison, this certainly isn't the best one. It's not nearly on the level of ""The Great Escape.""

I agree with the other reviewers who noticed it moves slowly.

One of the other problems I had with it is the lack of problems to overcome along the way to the escape attempt. There were no real setbacks as in other escape movies in the process of setting up the escape. They didn't get caught and have to start over, for example (cf. Colditz). None of the escape team were injured, killed, or replaced beforehand. There is no mole. There isn't a lot of tension or difference of opinion between the members of the escape team, or controversy deciding who gets to be part of the team.

Then, during the actual escape attempt, there really weren't any great new challenges to overcome where they had to adapt to unexpected events or circumstances. Sure there is drama and some suspenseful music in EFA, but there could have been so much more, and there will be if/when there is a remake.

Clint Eastwood plays his popular persona in Escape from Alcatraz that he played in numerous popular Westerns and police movies. Tough, reserved, independent, leader. He's more restrained than he was in the Dirty Harry movies he did a few years before this in the 1970s.

And that's one thing I liked about EFA: its restraint. There is some prison violence, but not that much considering how extreme the prison and its inmates. The warden is mean but not as vicious as some prison wardens in other prison movies (Midnight Express).

The cast of characters:

* a prison escape artist (Eastwood)

* a mean prison warden

* a middle-aged white inmate who likes to paint

* a cool ""senior"" black inmate who works at the library

* a spurned ""gay"" inmate who seeks revenge on Morris (Eastwood)

* a middle-aged inmate who has a pet mouse

* a few con men who become part of the escape team

* an inmate who is Morris's ""neighbor""

* a few other inmates and guards

The characters aren't that interesting.

Anyways, my personal connection to this goes back to 1978 when my family took a vacation to San Fran and we toured Alcatraz.  They were refurbishing sections of the prison for the upcoming film starring Clint Eastwood.  Even though I was a lad, I was already a huge fan of Clint!  When the film came out, we went and saw it in the theater, I was fascinated.  Final note, look up this subject on the net, there was just a posting about a manuscript that came from Seattle and the owner gave it to the authorities to look into.  This story says that the three men did make it, and then were murdered for money and buried off I-90 somewhere in Washington.  Maybe? who knows?

 Although the movie was released way back in 1979 the film still holds up today. It's mainly about a prisoner, played superbly by Eastwood, who attempts to escape prison with two other inmates. The movie documents their attempts in leaving one of the most well-secured prisons in the U.S., Alcatraz, located in San Francisco Bay. Roberts Blossom, who once played one of the most evil characters in soaps (Sven in ""Another World""), also has a supporting role as a prisoner who befriends the Eastwood character.

If you're familiar with the books on the subject: ""Escape from Alcatraz"" by John Campbell Bruce, and ""Breaking the Rock"" by Jolene Babyak, who actually lived there, you'll find that the real story is way more intriguing than the film could ever be. So much of the film tries to unnecessarily sensationalize events or characters, like the the black inmate English, and his relationship to Morris never existed, nor could it have in 1960-62 prison life. One of the reasons these guys wound up in Alcatraz was because of their extreme racial animosity. The efforts of the (four) prisoners to get out was more intense, involved, time consuming, and dangerous than the film makes out.

241155,4,6300213900,"Prison movies have a tendency to dissolve into contrived stereotypes, so watching ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ is soothing relief.  Outside of the typical sadistic warden (yet Patrick McGoohan makes a most interesting and believable villain), this film concentrates more on the logistics of breaking out of ""The Rock""--the formidable federal prison Alcatraz, isolated on its own island in the icy waters of San Francisco Bay.  Based on a true story, Clint Eastwood plays calm, level-headed Frank Morris, a prisoner on a mission to be the first to escape.

While conditions inside the prison are stark, brutal, and harsh (yet name me one maximum security prison where they're not), this movie doesn't reach its stride until Morris makes up his mind to escape, comes up with an ingenious plan, then patiently implements it.  Assisted primarily by two brothers (look for a young Fred Ward), the machinations as the prisoners chisel away at their air vents, smuggle tools into their cells, utilize plaster of paris (as well as making it in their tiny sinks), are fascinating viewing.  There are setbacks to be sure, along with plenty of almost-getting-discovered suspense, but as ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ concludes you'll be cheering the escapees on.

I doubt it was a coincidence that the warden remains unnamed...identifying him as a person would've begun to assign some vestige of humanity to the character  ( from reading the actual book which this movie was based on, I believe the warden in the movie was a composite of wardens Blackwell, Johnston and Madigan ).  Conversely, very little is shown regarding Morris's actual crime(s), beyond a very brief glimpse of his folder, with the word ""larceny"" visible.  I suppose the intent was to build camaraderie and support throughout the movie  ( might have been more difficult to garner sympathy for Morris had it been revealed that he was a sociopath, or chronic child abuser! ).",1241395200,2,951,4.839506172839506

And Eastwood, laconic as ever, is captivating as the brains behind the plan. His scenes with McGoohan, though brief, are thick with psychological tension. Though ""Alcatraz"" takes its time building to the climactic bust-out attempt by Morris's team, Siegel never lets your nerves rest.",1183420800,,525,5.337349397590361
241239,4,6300213900,"In the 29 years of Alcatraz's existence, and despite the strict measures, 39 captives tried to escape from America's premier maximum-security prison during its existence... Thirty six of whom failed... This script is about the other three, of whom nothing is known... They may have drowned in San Francisco Bay, or they may have got away...

Morris (Clint Eastwood) was a loner, a rebel against society, the perfect hero that Siegel loves... Lee Marvin in 'The Killers', Steve McQueen in 'Hell is for Heroes', and Richard Widmark in 'Madigan' were all similar types in films which he had directed..

In 'Escape From Alcatraz,' Eastwood gives his best screen acting to date... It is a charismatic performance that is so idiosyncratic, persuasive, and powerful... Eastwood, gave Morris the rough, intelligent aspect that is immediately palpable...

The first few minutes of the film consist of Morris being brought by boat to Alcatraz, inspected by a doctor and thrown into a cell... Throughout this, Eastwood does not speak... But already the audience feels it... They know the character... He has been through this before... He tries to control his mind... He builds a barrier between himself and his surroundings... He holds back his fear but he's not so foolish as to appear brave... Behind his impassivity, his mind is calculating... He is studying everyone... Everyone knows, prison guards and fellow prisoners alike, that this is not a man to be intimidated with easily...

But Siegel wasn't making a film about penal cruelty or miscarriage of justice or anything like that... He was presenting a meditative study of the inflexibility of human spirit, with a star strong enough in himself to join one sequence to the next... Both Siegel and Eastwood are known for violence, but there's relatively little of it this time...

This is not to say that Siegel has no interest in character... Stereotype characters, such as Doc and Litmus, make the film more entertaining... A further example is the inevitable homosexual Wolf (Bruce M. Fisher), who points out that Morris is a potential victim but realizes he has met his match when he approaches him in the showers one morning and gets three unexpected blows in the groin and a bar of soap in the mouth for his harassment... Another familiar type of character is English (Paul Benjamin), the leader of the Black mafia, who sits in the yard far away from the white inmates... English proves to be a nice guy..

But the biggest stereotype of them all is the cold warden, although Patrick McGoohan tries as hard as he can to provide Morris with some individual personality... Apart from the flower-crushing and constant attention to his nails, he is permitted by the scriptwriter merely to recite phrases that might have come from the prison handbook: 'No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz alive. Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket. I was specially chosen to make sure the stink from that basket doesn't escape.'

But two elements in the film are absolutely real: one is the central character, which will be considered in a moment, and the other is 'The Rock' itself...

Siegel's overwhelming achievement is to send the audience to infamous prison for two hours... The claustrophobia, the implicit suppression of any joy, the barbarity of being caged in isolation cells, all these suffocating atrocities come across with such reality that one experiences a total sense of relief when the camera moves into the recreation yard for the clear bright light of every early morning... Siegel's technique in this respect is unique...

Siegel's film style seems almost a cinematic interpretation of Eastwood screen persona: lean, clean, and harsh... Here is one example: When the incorrigible psychopath is out to finish Eastwood, his one chance is in the exercise yard... When he enters the yard, he is in need for a weapon... He has none! He slowly advances into the yard toward his victim... The camera goes down to the man's right hand as he walks... After a moment, another man puts a knife in that hand... The camera stays on the hand as he keeps moving... After another moment, another hand reaches in and grabs the con's arm.... The whole brief sequence is loaded with surprise and suspense... It is in two words: pure cinema...

Siegel's movie follows the known facts of the escape constantly, permitting itself only one act of poetic license at the very end... Throughout the film, Siegel uses a yellow chrysanthemum as a symbol of 'heart', to indicate that although the brutal system may have removed everything from the inmates save the questionable privilege of remaining alive, in some men at least their spirit survives...

'Doc', an elderly inmate who has spent twenty years there but who is permitted to paint and cultivate chrysanthemums, introduces the concept...",1167177600,43,4849,4.9888613861386135

241302,5,6300213900,"""Escape from Alcatraz"" is based on a true story; but I'm not sure just how true the story is. What I do know is that three men did escape from Alcatraz and were never seen again. No trace of their bodies were ever recovered. While, in the end, it looksl ike they probably drowned. It's still interesting to think about. Anyway, don't worry that wasn't a spoiler. You can get that from the back cover. This movie (despite knowing what's going to happen) is very entertaining, genuinely suspenceful, and it's clear just how much shows like ""Prison Break"" owe to it. The movie stars Clint Eastwood ('Unforgiven') as Frank Morris, a convict who is shipped to the infamous Alcatraz Prison after attempting to escape from the last prison he was in. Frank adapts to life at Alcatraz, although it isn't easy. While, this film doesn't match the brutality a movie like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" did, this film captures the claustrophobia of the prison perfectly. Anyway, Frank quickly befriends a few colorful characters; Doc (Roberts Blossom), English (Paul Benjamin), Charley Butts (Larry Hankin), and two people we gather he'd known before...John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward & Jack Thibeau).

While only 3 of the men escape, all these characters end up playing important roles in the escape. This movie was made way back in 1979 and barely seems dated. It's realistic for it's time and all and was actually shot at Alcatraz, which helps. All the actors are really good, especially Eastwood who's in one of his best performances here. The movie is also very smart, it explores in detail exactly what they did to get out. The biggest problem with this movie isn't even the movie, it's the DVD. They need to do a new transfer and put out a special editon. This might only pertain to my copy, but there were times where I could barely hear the dialogue (and there's no English subtitles). There's no special features (a featurette on the escapees would have been nice); But the movie is really flawless. If you like the show ""Prison Break"" or enjoy prison movies, this is one of the best.

Clint Eastwood plays a convict sent to Alcatraz. He has been in other federal prisons but his proclivity to escape has gotten him sent to the island. While there, he befriends some other convicts and makes plans to do what nobody else has ever done. He plans to escape.

Most of the first part of the movie is spent learning about the convicts and what brought them to Alcatraz. It examines the motivations and shows what leads each one to be willing to risk death in order to get out of the hellhole. The second half deals with how they actually make their escape. It is no easy thing on a rock island. Throughout it all, Patrick McGoohan, as the warden, puts in brief but memorable appearances. It is his style of running things that so makes everyone want out. When they make it, you are glad he finally has egg on his face.

There is not much action in terms of fights and stunts but most of the film is action in the sense that people are shown doing things. Dialog is minimal compared to seeing what the characters are actually doing.

The film concludes emphasizing that Frank and the Anglin brothers were never caught, and their bodies never found, and notes the warden's quick declaration that they drowned.  The movie, in my interpretation, implies that the escape must have been successful.

However, it is far more likely that they drowned.  The plan was for the men to swim to Marin County via Angel Island, break into a clothing store in Tiburon to change out of their prison clothes, and steal a car to get out of the area.  No such crimes were committed in the days or weeks following the escape.  Furthermore, the Morris and Anglin families were never contacted by the escapees, something that would seem likely in the weeks, months, or years since.

Another interesting fact is that a man (Seymour Webb) committed suicide, in front of numerous witnesses, off the Golden Gate Bridge on the very night of the escape and during the same window of time -- his body was never found either, despite very quick attempts by the Coast Guard to rescue him.  (The tidal currents can be very strong in San Francisco Bay.)

There has been at least one Alcatraz escapee (Floyd Hamilton) who was declared drowned but found alive two days after his escape when he returned to the prison (starving and cold) after hiding in a cave along the shore.

Attention Directors and Producers:  There's plenty more true historical Alcatraz material for a new version of this movie or on other Alcatraz subjects!

241310,5,6300213900,"I first saw this movie when I was real young and didn't remember it much. I saw it was coming on the TV but I was skeptical about watching it and thought it might come off as boring. This was not the case at all. The movie turned out great and I think it is a must see. You get drawn in very quickly by the characters and then when they start their escape plans you get drawn in even more. I can't believe people actually thought of such a difficult way to escape but they did and boy did it work. I feel bad for the lone guy who didn't make it out to escape in time. English was probably my favorite character. He is intriguing and very cool. Once you watch it I'm sure you will have your opinions.

One thing I thought the movie could use was.... More time. I think it could have been played out a little more inside the prison or something.

On a side note I find it akward that alcatraz closed about a year after these guys escaped. Had their escape sort of closed the doors? If so why? It still could be a top security prison with the help of a little more focus on certain things.

It's great watching the build up to the prison breakout. My only slight niggle is that the film ought to have been a little bit longer. But overall, it certainly stands up to repeated viewing and comes well recommended. If you are considering purchasing this on DVD be warned, it comes with no extras.

241392,5,6300213900,"This is pretty much a pretty agreed upon film by fans and critics alike. Director Don Siegel delivered one of the finest prison films, and told it like it is. Not a content film?. Please. Fan-worthy only?. Nope. This is the real deal. It's based upon a strue story of three inmates, and the greatest escape put together on the island prison known as Alcatraz. The one and only Clint Eastwood stars as real life convict Frank Morris, a life long criminal who was shipped to Alcatraz on a rainy night on January 20, 1960. Morris' crimes began at a very young age, but by the time he became a young adult, he was involved with narcotics possession and robbery. Because of his widely know intelligence, and his penchant for amazing escapes elsewhere, he is sent to the rock. There, he butts heads with the steely cool warden, played marvelously by Patrick McGoohan, who you will remember from the old TV show, ""The Prisoner"". Morris' plan of escape sets into motion when he meets fellow convicts, the Anglin brothers, John and Clarence. One of whom played by a then unknown Fred Ward. Through working in the prison and creating such helpful escape concoctions they made like rafts, and rubber boats, the plan was in motion. The biggest creation they made were life like dummies of their heads, to sit in their beds to fool their guards. The Anglin brothers even named their own dummy heads. They named them Oink and Oscar. If you don't know the story, or the whole thing, saying anything more like how they got out and what the result of their ingenious escape was, would be saying too much. I'll let you watch and find out yourselves. The movie has the right feel of a prison. Actually filming on location at the famed prison certainly didn't hurt either. That's one of the best things here that adds to the movie's truthful story and it's authenticity. Eastwood is one of cinema's best film idols, and this is definitley one of his best roles among many. He doesn't portray Frank Morris as a character on a page in a Hollywood film script, but fully imbues the role with realism and humanity. McGoohan is equally good as the warden, and the scenes and chemistry between the two are as engaging and interesting as anything else. The movie may be slow and uneventful for some, but anyone with an attention span and appreciation for a fine film faithfully re-telling a true story, you will see just how addictive this film really is. The tours they have at Alcatraz include seeing just where and how the three got out of their cells. Of course, their cells are marked and shown, and there are pictures of the dummy heads. Sadly, the real things are not on display for anyone to see. There is a sign saying which cell Eastwood used in the making of the film too. There hasn't been anything like it since.",1092873600,6,2798,4.575697211155378

second--i have no idea what the reviewer below is talking about with regards to mr. mcgoohan's personal life.  it's a hurtful and ridiculous accusation to begin with, one that i've never heard before in any interview, trade; or coming from any source; and at any rate, it has absolutely nothing to do with an actor's skills or their ability to be a great performer.
in fact, i've never even heard of this idiotic rumor in a tabloid.  perhaps the reviewer below needs to get his facts straight before talking trash about a great actor like mr. mcgoohan, who is undoubtedly one of the most underrated performers out there, but still one of the best.",1089676800,6,1042,4.804469273743017

No gimmicks, no sex to speak of, and really it was a man's movie as I believe only one female appeared in the whole movie. Everyone was acting their all and even the bit part actors were in top form.  It was exciting without being a bloodbath and I enjoyed seeing the movie again after many years.  Nearly 2 hours of first class entertainment and look out for Danny Glover in his first starring role I believe.

241397,5,6300213900,"Seldom do Amazon.com reviewers agree on ratings for films they watch, but for this one, the vote is in and it is unanimous.  Escape from Alcatraz is a winner.
Director Don Siegel is pitch perfect from beginning to end.  Many reviewers who have been to Alcatraz comment on the realism of this film.  Siegel gives us an inside look at what it might have been like to be imprisoned on ""the rock.""  From the black hole of solitary confinement to the painfully small individual cells of the prisoners, Alcatraz was a nasty place meant for only the nastiest criminals.
One of these prisoners is Frank Morris, expertly played by Clint Eastwood, who is transferred to Alcatraz, gets into a fight with an inmate who wants to make him his ""punk,"" and spends time in the black hole.  When he gets out of solitary, Morris begins to plan his escape.  Several reviewers comment on the fact that Hollywood does not get these facts straight, but I didn't much care.  I was pulled very quickly into Morris's plans and then the actual mechanics of the breakout, which were genuinely interesting and toward the end, had me sitting at the edge of my chair as I waited with suspense to see how the story would end.
The escape is obviously central to the entire plot, but the life of prisoners at Alcatraz is also dramatized expertly by Don Siegel.  The warden, Patrick McGoohan, is aloof and professional, but he has a mean streak, which makes life harder than it needs to be on the rock.  Frank Morris is smart enough not to get mad, but to get even, and this he does with three other inmates who assist him in the breakout. The warden and his guards are constanly on the alert for any suspicious behavior and we hold our breath from time to time as the escape plan is almost detected.
At last the time comes and we go step by step with Morris and two of his crew as they head for the icy waters surrounding Alcatraz.  The fourth member of the crew hesitated and was left behind.  This appears to follow the real-life events as mentioned by other reviewers.
Did Morris and his buddies successfully navigate the treacherous waters surrounding Alcatraz?  I'll leave that question unanswered.  Viewers can decide for themselves.
What is certain, at least to the reviewers of Amazon.com, is that Escape from Alcatraz is a well-made, highly suspenseful film from beginning to end, and it is one of Clint Eastwood's best roles -- that's saying something.  Highly recommended!",1077321600,36,2449,4.651972157772621
241398,5,6300213900,"This is one of these great movies that keeps you cheering for the villans as they attempt to outwit the establishment; This time it's the notorious Alcatraz Federal Prison and it's cold and heartless warden, played excellently by Patrick McGoohan (he also played the equally cold and ruthless King Longshanks in Braveheart).  By prison movie standards, this one is very realistic and keeps you in suspense right to the end. It's my second-favorite prison movie, just behind The Shawshank Redemption.
Clint Eastwood plays Frank Morris, a life-long con who has been sent to Alcatraz in part because of his successful past escape attempts.  The warden advises Morris that Alcatraz was built to keep all the ""rotten eggs in one basket.""  Seconds later, Morris finds his first 'tool' to assist in his escape; the wardens nail clippers!  Later, Morris meets his soon-to-be accomplices, brothers he met in another institution.  It's not long before Morris finds his path to freedom, with the unlikely aid of a cockroach. Together, taking risky and cunning chances to sneak items into their cells to assist in their escape, the three men and one more-reluctant con find a way to make their break.  The build-up to the escape is absolutely brilliant.  Every scene leaves you on the edge of your seat.  You can imagine what it was really like trying to pull off this escape.
The beauty of this movie is that it is based on a true story.  It is the most famous of all prison escapes and one of the few where the fate of the escapees is unknown to this day.  It would be awesome, assuming they lived, that one or more of the escapees would come forward to tell their story today.  I would support a pardon for all three of them just for pulling it off. As for their fate, I recently watched a documentary that attempted to replicate their escape and determine if they could have survived swimming in that frigid Bay-area water.  Even an experienced swimmer could not make it.  It was determined that unless a boat was waiting for them, they would have died of hypothermia and been swept out to sea by the strong currents.
There was a fourth escapee of Alcatraz that we don't know the fate of: the little mouse that belonged to the old man.  Remember, Morris put him in his shirt pocket and said, ""You're coming along, too."" I hope they made it!",1043366400,5,2332,4.669926650366748

He stated that ""Escape from Alcatraz"" is the most accurate account out of any movie out there. ""Murder in the First"" is more interesting and moves faster, but that is because they change almost the whole story around.

241450,5,6300213900,"I have had a fasination about what it was like being a prisoner on the rock. Recently I went to visit Alcatraz to take a look for myself and I was so stunned that I was actually on the rock, where they kept the worst of the worst. After my trip I immediatly rented Escape of Alcatraz(because out of all of the movies made of Alcatraz this one is the most acurate!).The movie was based on a true story about the 1962 breakout.  After watching it I found interesting little things that hollywood changed just to make it unique. In the movie there were three people in on it ,but in reality there were four and Clint Eastwood's charactor wasn't the one that planned it. Sure his charactor made it out ,but since this was hollywood and Clint Eastwood was star of the movie his charactor needed to plan it and escape. The one who planned it didn't make it out with the others. He did try five hours after the other three made it out.
It's still a hollywood gem. I loved the movie a lot. Clint Eastwood is great in this one (as he does with all of his other films) I enjoyed it even more that they acually filmed the movie on Alcatraz(so if you've been there you would notice many of the places they filmed at). The story is very straight forward and rock hard performances. As well as an ending that leads you to differant conclusions.",1029628800,,1330,4.298804780876494
241451,5,6300213900,"Escape from Alcatraz is one of my most favourite movies of all time and has to be one of the best true stories that ever made it to the screen as far as true crime goes. Yes, it was a true crime because they escaped from prison and that is a crime in itself. Eastwood is my favourite actor and has been since I was seven and I am now thirty one. His performance is one of the best here in this movie, he doesn't disappoint. There are some standout scenes in this movie-one is where the warden tells him no one has ever really made it on the outside after escaping from prison. They have either been caught or shot. The warden tells him no one has ever made it and no one ever will. When the warden tells Morris(Eastwood)that the look on his face looks like the warden has just issued him a challenge and Morris's face looks like as if to say, We'll see about that. Don't bet on it.
Other standout parts in this movie for me are the following scenes:
A prison guard tells Morris that he has a new job and that he will be paid fifteen cents an hour and Eastwood replies,""Well, I always knew crime would pay.""
Another scene is a convict tells Eastwood he always wanted to see San Francisco but he thought it would be never like this-he had stolen a car from a prison guard and drove it across the state and wound up in AlacatraZ.
Same convict asks Eastwood did he know how old he was and he said he didn't know and the convict says,""Jeez, what kind of childhood did you have?""
Eastwood replies,""Short.""
An actor I found interesting in this movie too was Fred Ward playing one of the Anglin brothers. The Anglins were caught trying to escape over a prison wall and sent to Alcatraz for Fifteen years. Ward asks himself, ""I wonder how i would be after fifteen years in this place?"" He never found out. He escaped with Morris.
How these three escaped, Morris and the Anglin Brothers was a stroke of genius. I wonder if they would all be alive now if they made it since they would be in their seventies now probably.
I recommend this movie a lot. I watched it three times in a row and I don't usually do that even with other great movies.",1023753600,2,2131,4.238329238329238
241452,5,6300213900,"Eastwood delivers one of his best performances as cool-headed escapee Frank Lee Morris. There's no Hollywood hype involved here, this movie is based on the actual events of the June '62 breakout from the maximum security prison. Many people have speculated that the three actually made good on their escape, this movie does nothing to dispel that notion. A great book for fans who want to know more about this infamous escape is 'Riddle of the Rock' by Don DeNevi. He clears up a lot of the details that went into the escape based on interviews with surviving ex-cons who were there at the time. Ironically enough, it was less than a year after the break that the prison was closed for good. As late as 1990, the ""tablespoon trio"" were thought to have robbed a bank up in Marianna, FL in the panhandle. The FBI put out a new poster offering a 1 million dollar reward leading to their arrest. What a story it would make if at least one of the surviving members were able to impart a ""death bed"" confession about their 40 years on the run!

Clint Eastwood portrays a very believable inmate who has a genius IQ. The locations are all authentic and the living conditions were right in line with accounts given by past inmates during interviews. I also would recommend The Shawshank Redemption, but would like to mention that the wardens in the two movies are different people. Patrick McGoohan is the warden in Escape From Alcatraz and Bob Gunton is the warden in The Shawshank Redemption.

241455,3,6300213900,"As the movie opens, the man (Eastwood) is stripped of his clothes and dignity.  The warden tells him no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz and never will.  From the inmate's perspective, this statement lays down a challenge for him.  With amazing resourcefulness, brilliance, patience, and team-work, he and two others escape from what the movie portrays as a tyrannical, cruel jail.
Some people say you can judge the state of a society by its jails.  If this is the case, according to this movie, society is inhospitable.  A man showed a flower, which he painted a picture of himself holding, which to him symbolizes what freedom the jail can't take away.  Painting is the only thing this man has to occupy his mind and the warden takes it away from him.  The man goes crazy and chops off his fingers in the woodshop. It isn't known where he got the flower from but the escapees leave it on the shore the night they escape.  The warden crushes it in his hand, vowing to find the drowned bodies in the water...
I think the movie portrays the escape as a hard-earned act of justice; the unlikely triumph of men desperately trying to survive in a cruel place (or cruel world, as the viewer may see fit). This movie is comparable to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" which I also recommend.  The same actor portrayed the warden in each movie.  I think both movies downplay the criminality of the inmates and instead portray them as the victims and their captors as guilty of cruelty.  Both involve successful jail escapes except that Escape from Alcatraz involves a much simpler plot and in the Redemption, there is a more powerful reversal after the escape.",997401600,,1648,4.6678200692041525
