8349977,5,B0023SPA6G,"The title includes ""3-years later.""  Over 140-Actors, 14-Nationalities and filmed on location in Thailand, Belgium, Bulgaria & the Ukraine.  Not to give away any of the plot lines, though a number of the main characters return, as part of a huge cast.  May just be the best done series that I have ever watched.  If you need further convincing, there is a very well done trailer that you can view by plugging the title into your search engine.  Unfortunately, there will not be a third series, though watch out for work to come from Marc Punt & Guy Goossens.",1253577600,,558,4.595959595959596
