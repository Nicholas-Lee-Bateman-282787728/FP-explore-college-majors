3041918,4,B000ZIZXAO,The first match with flair vs mvp was boring. Nothing even happened.  I give it a 2/10. The second match with jericho vs jbl was still not an eye opener but a bit better. 4/10. Now edge vs rey mysterio. It was okay but why was mysterio getting booed? And it was in edges heel days so of course he used vickie to win. 5/10. Next is jeff hardy vs randy orton. Nothing to say. Boring match. 1/10. The royal rumble event made up for crappy starter matches 10/10,1351209600,,457,4.134831460674158
3041919,5,B000ZIZXAO,this was an awesome Royal Rumble..i was honored & lucky to have witnessed this live as i always do a WWE Event at the garden...all the matches were good...loved that Y2J & JBL had a blood bath..i loved it all...wished my Boy Triple H won..the John Cena  30th entrant surprise nobody expected...this is still 1 of the better royal rumbles..def worth the purchase,1295395200,,361,4.73015873015873
3041920,3,B000ZIZXAO,The 2008 edition of the Royal Rumble lacked something for me...Ric Flair defeated MVP in a match that was plodding and sedating to me as the watcher. The Savior Chris Jericho went bezerk on JBL with a chair as part of a fued that I don't recall going much of anywhere and even the Rumble match lacked a bit of star-power after the Undertaker-Shawn Michaels left. Although the crowd did seem reasonably excited for the showdown between Triple H and John Cena. The part of the Rumble with Piper and Snuka was kinda sad two guys nearing sixty staggering around the ring getting their licks in on guys half their age before they where mercilessly eliminated by Kane. Randy Orton and Edge retain championships as the Road to Wrestlemania begins.,1276732800,,740,4.7

3041922,4,B000ZIZXAO,"Career Threatening Match: MVP vs. Ric Flair

This match was fun. The special stipulation that Vince McMahon set up for all of Flair's matches in 2008 was that the first time he lost, it would be his retiring match. They played up the fact that MVP was disrespecting Flair and Flair well, plus the match was very well done, with a lot of back-and-forth action. Everything was fast-paced, and Flair even took some bumps, including a superplex and a sick big boot in the corner. The finish was swift and precise, and harkened back to earlier in the match when Flair locked in the Figure Four and had worked over MVP's leg. The only problem was the match was way too short. Match Rating: 4/5

Chris Jericho vs. JBL

There was actually a story behind this one. The month prior at Armageddon, JBL had cost Jericho the WWE Championship by getting Randy Orton disqualified when he intjerected himself into the match and nailed Jericho with a big boot while Jericho had Orton in the Walls of Jericho. JBL and Jericho then had a back-and-forth, very violent feud leading up to this match. The actual match was quite good, with Jericho and JBL nailing a lot of powerful moves with lots of excitement and counters thrown in. This match was also way too short and the ending, Jericho getting disqualified for smacking JBL with a chair, was just a bad idea. There was actually blood in this match though, a rare thing for WWE these days it seems, and the aftermath was pretty violent with Jericho smacking JBL with the chair again and choking the life out of him. Match Rating: 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (champion) (w/ Vickie Guerrero, Curt Hawkins, and Zack Ryder) vs. Rey Mysterio

Holy damn. This match was fast-paced and pretty epic throughout the entire thing. Rey was particularly amazing, hitting all of the sweet spots and being very unorthodox and original. He nailed a tornado DDT on Edge on the outside of the ring, and he also took a few bumps. Edge worked over Rey's leg for a lot of the match and he tried to cheat a couple of times, and the finish was also pretty good. Vickie Guerrero took the blunt of the 619 for Edge, and when Ray went to hit the West Coast Pop regardless, Edge Speared him in mid-air. Fantastic match and a fantastic finish. Match Rating: 5/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (champion) vs. Jeff Hardy

Another great match. The crowd was really behind Jeff, and there was a lot of solid wrestling going on. Orton and Jeff took a few bumps, with Orton nailing the security barrier pretty damn hard at one point. There were a lot of near falls and Jeff nailed a sweet moonsault on the outside of the ring, though they messed up and only a tiny part of Jeff's leg actually hit Orton. The match did slow down at one point when the two men grappled in the center of the ring, which was disappointing since it's a Jeff Hardy match and it didn't really work well, but the finish was great. Jeff went for the Twist of Fate (after missing the Swanton Bomb), but Orton spun with it and nailed Hardy with the RKO to get the pinfall. Match Rating: 4/5

Royal Rumble Match

I was disappointed a little with this Rumble. There were no weapons or anything cool like that used throughout the whole thing, but there were quite a few highlights. Undertaker and HBK were the first two entrants, which was perfect considering they were the last two men in the ring at last year's Rumble. Shelton Benjamin leaping on top of the top turnbuckle was impressive, and the surprise appearances by Jimmy Snuka and Roddy Piper, as well as their mini-match, was also pretty cool. Undertaker went ballistic and leg dropped Snitsky through a table for really no reason, and the last three men, Batista, Triple H, and (surprise) John Cena, played their parts well. Triple H was the last man eliminated by John Cena nailing an FU to the outside of the ring as the two of them had a pretty impressive one on one battle for a while. Regardless of Cena's surprise appearance, Michaels and Undertaker really stole the show. Mick Foley being in a match without using any weapons was just sad, as well as the lack of hardcore action in general. Match Rating: 4/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

There were some funny moments with Santino Marella, Ashley, and Maria. Santino is great on the mic and he deserves more attention. Also, Ric Flair, Mr. Kennedy, Shawn Michaels, and Batista shared an epic segment in the locker room. There is also a scene with Vince McMahon, Hornswoggle, and Finlay, continuing the storyline that states that Hornswoggle is Vince McMahon's son. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS

The highlight of the Extras is really the Intercontinental Championship Match that took place between Orton and Hardy prior to the Rumble. Jeff's Swanton Bomb off the top of the Titan Tron was breathtaking and totally worth watching repeatedly. Extras Rating: 5/5",1246492800,,4857,4.653442240373396
3041923,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Ric Flair Vs. United States Champion M.V.P. - This was a good opener as it didn't bore the crowd. Flair looked a little off in the match but this is still better then their match from Vengeance. A nice opener but nothing really to mention here. 3/5

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield Vs. Chris Jericho - Bradshaw's first in-ring PPV since Judgment Day of 2006. The match came off more of a brawling and slugfest type of bout as we see from J.B.L. rather then a technical masterpiece we see from Jericho. It ends when a bloody Chris Jericho gets himself disqualified after hitting J.B.L. with a steel chair and then proceeds to choke out Bradshaw with a camera cable. A good Rumble return for both Chris Jericho and J.B.L. but isn't their best match. 3.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge Vs. Rey Mysterio - Edge was the huge favorite in this match as he got more cheers from the NYC crowd then Mysterio got. Edge targets Mysterio's knee a few minutes into the match to allow Rey not able to use his high flying offense against Edge. Rey was able to pull out new moves out of his bag of tricks to counter Edge that includes Rey sliding out of the ring to score with a DDT to Edge on the floor. After an interference from Vickie Guerrero (who gets a 619 for her troubles), Edge hits Rey with a spear out of mid-air for the win. 4/5 (Also Available On ""Edge: Decade Of Decadence"")

WWE Championship
Randy Orton Vs. Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy - This match had a big time buildup and feel to it. Orton and Hardy gave a great performance out there and they produced a very good WWE Title Match. The MSG crowd was very electric in this match as Hardy and Orton went back and forth against one another. In the end, Randy Orton hits a RKO out of nowhere and since Survivor Series against Shawn Michaels, Orton getting a clean WWE Title win. 4.5/5

30 Man Royal Rumble Match
This Rumble Match, unfortunately, didn't stick out like previous Rumbles in the past has done. The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels has very good showings after entering at #1 and #2. Batista is another that has a long perfromance showing in the match after entering at #8. This Rumble Match has many surprise entrants in Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Mick Foley, and the biggest in John Cena. The HHH and Cena face off in this Rumble Match reminded me of the Hulk Hogan/Ultimate Warrior face off from the Royal Rumble in 1990. After the #29 entrant, things begin to pick up and get more interesting. Again, this isn't a bad Rumble Match but it isn't one of the top Royal Rumble Matches. 4.5/5

Overall, this a nice Royal Rumble PPV to see. None of the matches were bad but they aren't anything special that will blow you away (besides the Orton/Hardy WWE Title Match). The Royal Rumble Match is good but it isn't one of the bests.",1243123200,,2795,4.4833005893909625

3041925,5,B000ZIZXAO,"2008 kicks off for the WWE with one of the biggest ppv's of the year: the Royal Rumble. As always, this show is billed as the place where we begin the ""Road to Wrestlemania."" The much anticipated Royal Rumble match will determine the main event for Wrestlemania. This DVD provides the show in full and has a bonus match from Raw.

THE SHOW
* Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs. MVP. Flair gives a good brief speech before the match, which gets the crowd fired up. These two give a better performance than their last meeting at Vengeance in June 2007. This is a good opener, with the hot New York crowd boosting this from a decent match to a good match.

* Mr. McMahon discusses the Rumble Match with Hornswoggle.

* Chris Jericho vs. JBL. These two give a good brawl. It is certainly not a wrestling match. JBL hasn't wrestled on ppv since Judgment Day of 2006, and he seems a bit rusty. However, the technical failings are covered up by some fun hardcore brutality. Jericho's big return seems to have fizzled quickly. :(

* Ashley tries to talk to Maria.

* World Championship: Edge (c) vs. Rey Mysterio. After winning the belt back last month at Armageddon, Edge defends his title against Mysterio. These two have always had good chemistry. Having been tag champs together, they know each other well. The match is enjoyable, but Edge never seems in danger of losing. The match ends with a cool looking spot.

* Ric Flair in his locker room. Good interactions with Kennedy, HBK, Batista, and Triple H.

* Maria's Kiss Cam. Ashley & Maria tease the annual Playboy shoot. This would be a failing boring segment if it weren't for Santino's humor. He's just really entertaining to watch.

* WWE Championship: Randy Orton (c) vs. Jeff Hardy. Following his upset victory at Armageddon, Jeff gets his first ppv title shot. The crowd is clearly behind him. Orton and Jeff were okay together, but seem to lack the strong energy needed to put on an amazing match. The suspense at the end is agonizing. There was a real feel that Jeff might actually win the title. The fans really wanted it, but they were denied.

* 2008 Royal Rumble match. This year's rumble was fun. The two to start it were the two that ended it last year. Throughout the match, we got a lot of good moments. The New York crowd really helped this match. There were some good surprise entrants, like Foley, Roddy Piper, and Jimmy Snuka. Now, the ending... despite how people complain about it now, just listen to the reaction when Cena arrives. It was easily the biggest surprise in ages, and the crowd's initial reaction tells it all. Its a lot of fun to watch the final three face off. This match had a good start and a good ending. The middle was a little slower this year, but certainly not bad.

EXTRAS
* Raw 1/14/08 - Intercontinental Championship: Jeff Hardy (c) vs. Randy Orton.

* Home Video Exclusive: Triple H talks to John Cena post Royal Rumble match.

Overall, this was a really fun show. The Rumble always adds some excitement to a show. Once again, some young wrestlers got to challenge for the World titles. Cena made a surprise return, and Jeff showed he had what it takes to be a main eventer.",1212019200,,3176,4.542907180385289

3041940,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Ric Flair vs. M.V.P. - It was a nice opening match that didn't bore me like their Vengeance match but past that, nothing really to mention here.

Chris Jericho vs. J.B.L. - The in-ring return of J.B.L. to PPV since Judgment Day 2006.  I thought it was just me but by reading the other reviews, I'm not alone here in that they seemed to be somewhat off & lacking that ""it"" to make this just anything past an ok match.  Maybe it was Bradshaw's ring rust but who really knows.  The best part of the match was everything that happened afterwards.

World Champion Edge vs. Rey Mysterio - Before I get started, I liked the fact that Michael Cole didn't ignore history & put over the fact that they were former WWE Tag Team Champions together...and an interesting trivia note is that they lost those titles in the exact same arena, MSG.  The match saw Edge (who had a heavy amount of fan support) target Mysterio's knee after the first couple of mins. resulting in Mysterio using other moves like him sliding under the bottom rope & hooking Edge for a DDT all in one motion.  Edge won after a spear on Mysterio who was in the middle of a top rope springboard.  The first ""better than average"" match of the night.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Jeff Hardy - This match had a big match buildup & feel to it.  They gave it their all here & showcased a performance that had the crowd going back & forth more than they had any other time of the night with Orton getting the victory after a RKO out of nowhere.  Orton got the strong performance & CLEAN PPV victory he's been needing since becoming champion.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - Before I get started again, that's was an awesome promotional ""by the numbers"" video WWE did on the match itself.  Unfortunally, this Rumble fell kind of flat as it was really lacking standout Rumble moments with some questionable & poor booking...like Finlay being disqualified for using a weapon (yet the Rumble went hardcore in 2001 & 2003).  Some things happened that got my attention like HBK, Taker, and to a lower extent Batista's long performances & the suprizes of Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, and John Cena.  Love or hate him, props to WWE for being able to keep that secret from leaking out.  It wasn't as boring as previous Rumbles have been but it's not one I would put on my top list either.

DVD extras are a backstage confrontation between Cena & Triple H along with the huge swanton bomb Hardy did to Orton on RAW. As a side note, it would have been sweet if they had one of those ""behind the scenes"" of the commercial things because that was one of the most entertaining WWE PPV commercials in recent memory.

So overall, this Rumble didn't have a bad match but it didn't really have any that would blow you away either past the Orton/Hardy match.  It was an average PPV that I recommend for a rental & see from there.",1204588800,6,2856,4.426386233269598
3041941,5,B000ZIZXAO,"There are a lot of naysayers about this PPV out there and I wanna clear the air.  Whether you like John Cena or not, this guy gives 110% to the fans and tried so hard to get through rehab at the speed he did.  When he arrived at the Rumble, people initially thought he was a guest backstage.  His return was amazing and done perfectly.  All the other matches on here were nothing less than great.  The Jeff Hardy one stands out.  Of course he wasn't gonna win the match, but being in the main event at the RR is an honor and proved that he can hang with the best of them.  He will probably win the title somewhere down the line this year or early next year if he keeps this up.",1204156800,,677,4.007462686567164
3041942,3,B000ZIZXAO,"The 21st edition of WWE's Royal Rumble takes place at Madison Square Garden this year, and there are a few questions that need to be answered. #1 Who is the better man JBL or Y2J? #2 Can the underdog Rey Mysterio beat Edge for smackdown's world title? #3 Can the risk taker Jeff Hardy take advantage of his WWE Title shot against the legend killer Randy Orton? and finally Who will win the rumble and go on to main event Wrestlemania 24?

Flair's Career On The Line
Ric Flair Vs. MVP
This was a pretty steady match considering how old Flair is now, it was an ok opening match but it doesnt come close to any classic Ric Flair match. Rating 3/5

JBL Vs. Chris Jericho
This match was ok it just wasn't long enough for me, all this match was used for was to further the storyline of jericho vs. jbl. I don't mind them trying to further the storyline but at one of your four biggest pay per views of the year that should not be the only concern you should also try to put on a entertaining match especially for the fans at home that paid to watch. Rating 2.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Rey Mysterio Vs. Edge (C)
Now this match was exciting although I think any world title match should be at least 20 minutes and I didn't really like the ending but it does set up another match between the 2. While this match is far from a classic it is also far from awful. Rating 4/5

WWE Championship
Jeff Hardy Vs. Randy Orton
Ok other than the actual rumble match this is the best of the night. These guys put on a good show, I think they should've been given a little more time but it was still a good solid title match. Rating 4/5

Royal Rumble Match
This was exciting as it is each year, and of course as many of you know John Cena made his surprise return to the WWE ahead of schedule as he was supposed to be out 6-8 months and he was only gone since october. I won't spoil anything else for whoever out there hasn't seen it yet but the dvd is worth owning if you love the rumble. Rating 5/5",1201651200,7,1988,4.166666666666667
3041943,5,B000ZIZXAO,"I'll just start by saying, this is the best WWE PPV since last WM.

Ric Flair vs MVP (Career Threatening match for Ric Flair)
A pretty slow-paced match. Ended in a Playmaker countered to a Figure-4 Leg Lock in which MVP tapped out. MVP gave two violent big boots to Flair. No cheating by either side is the biggest dissapointment. 2.5/5

Chris Jericho vs JBL
Lack of spots is the biggest fault in this match. Also I didn't buy this feud from the start. Best part was when they botched a Bulldog and the crowd booed loudly. Ends with Jericho DQing himself, and then strangling JBL with a cord. 3/5

Edge vs Rey Mysterio (World Heavyweight Title)
A few high-flying moves by Mysterio, and a couple of more powerful moves by Edge, including a powerslam. Ending was O.K. although many see it as a screwjob. Vickie takes the 619 for Edge, Edge mid-air Spears Mysterio. That was awesome. 4/5

Randy Orton vs Jeff Hardy (WWE Title)
An instant match of the year candidate. Many high-flying moves by Hardy. The best part about this is that finally, a heel wins with a clean finish. Jeff gives Orton a violent kick which sends him crashing to the security wall. It ends with Orton countering Jeff's Twist of Fate to an RKO. 5/5

The Royal Rumble Main Event
Wow... the WWE creative team should be killed for this. Cena comes back and wins the rumble. They could've let HHH win it but no. The one everyone hates comes back and wins it. Otherwise this was my favorite rumble match of all-time. But that bloody Cena comes... why can't he just go somewhere and die in peace. That takes 1 point from an otherwise awesome match. 4/5

Overall: 74% of possible points. That means it is the best since last the last WM.",1201564800,5,1698,4.4789644012944985
3041944,5,B000ZIZXAO,"To the reviewer from Germany who named it ""Royal Fumble"", I strongly suggest you get some help if you were disappointed with the Rumble ending. Also, you obviously don't follow WWE because NOBODY knew Cena was going to be in the match as he was supposed to be out until the summer. You said there was nobody left in the ring worthy of a mania title shot so that meant Cena was coming out??? haha, Batista and Triple H were still in there buddy, and incase you didn't know, they are good to go as far as main eventing mania is concerned.",1201478400,,536,4.264705882352941
3041945,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Someone who didn't watch WWE since they changed their name may be surprised, and most likely quite irritated, by the names who headline major WWE events nowadays. And their irritation is not quite unjustified.
People like Randy Orton, Edge or John Cena lacks a certain punch - or in the case of Cena, everything - compared to the likes of Michaels, Triple H, Jericho or The Undertaker.
And to this day I would rather turn in for Ric Flair than Edge or Orton.

Ric Flair opened with his carreer-ending match against MVP. Seeing Flair and Charles Robinson in the same ring brought back memories of the late WCW. I realise this has little to do with this event, but as the event has little to do with old WWF, it may be worth mentioning.
That were good times in WCW, before it turned into RAW light, when Robinson was Flair's personal (gimmick-) referee, which led to a feud with Roddy Piper and Randy Savage, culminating in a match at Slamboree between Robinson and Savage's female protege Gorgeous George for the Macho Man's carreer. That was entertainment, that was witty.
Enertaining, witty ... so I was right, this has nothing to do with WWE.
To witness in this match.
It was a perfect examination for those who want to know why WWE lacks grand character in this era. Look at Ric Flair, even at his age it's all about flow, performance and credibility. Now look at MVP, all fancy moves and posing, but no flow, no character; just move after move. Flair outperformed him in every aspect.
Had this been Flair's last match, it would have been, lightly put, a disgrace.
And it starts a series of mishaps throughout all matches. (2/5)

Next one on the card was Jericho Vs JBL. This promised as much as Wrestlemania 22's Chris Benoit Vs JBL, with the additional bonus of having an intense storyline. It was one of those matches who have no real start and no real ending, and therefor no real climax. The crowd wasn't into this at all, continuing the atmospheric downfall of the Flair match.
And it continued the series of half-cooked spots and inexplicable mishaps. At the match's supposed climax, Jericho fumbles his running facebuster, which caused the audience to boo.
The DQ ending in favour of JBL didn't help the atmoshpere either. Not even Jericho's retaliation. (2/5)

Edge Vs Rey Misterio. Rey Misterio. Let me ask the booking team the following: do you have *any* idea why it's called HEAVYWEIGHT championship? At least it's consistent with the credibility of having John Cena as the leader of the company.
Rey has fantastic abilities, Edge, undoubtly, has talent. This match, however, doesn't showcase it. If you consider for a moment what high-paced athletes these two usually are, this match was as slow as a match between Khali and Mark Henry. The two R-Rated no-names acting as Edge's bodyguards are useless as well.
At this point of the Royal Rumble, the sloppyness of the matches was really apparent. Rey fumbles no less than three Hurancanranas, and Rey and Edge seemed very irritated by one another.
And of course nobody expected Vicky Guerrero to interfere ... (2/5)

Oh, and we're treated to the first-ever ""Royal Rumble Kiss-Cam"". Great, as if the atmosphere wasn't cold enough!

Jeff Hardy Vs Randy Orton was the only decent, well-paced match of the evening, with a satisfying end. And apparently the WWE Title works just as well without John Cena. Never was the phrase ""You can't see me!"" more useful.
Make no mistake, the match was nowhere near the quality a match for the WWE Title at a Royal Rumble should have, but looking at surrounding events, it's probably as good as it currently gets. (3/5)

Now on to the Royal Rumble match. Michael Buffer gave the event a glamour that wasn't at all present in the last two hours. Nevertheless, a cool way to start (Buffer used to announce all WCW PPV main events, so that brought back some memories).
First impressions first: what Taker (#1) and Michaels (#2) showed in the first three minutes clearly outclassed anything we've seen thus far.
This Rumble was in my opinion the best of the last few years because there was always something going on, and the eliminations were well-placed. To my great joy, the crowd yelled ""You can't wrestle!"" as The Great Khali entered. Thank god he survived only a minute.
The Rumble could have been a great joy, but with John Cena in the equation, it was all more or less predetermined.
I knew Cena was coming back, it was no great mystery if you strictly follow the Cena-logic: he always has the biggest venue despite his patently limited skills and he can only come in as # 30 because he can't handle being in a Rumble.
Even though I knew it before the event, you knew it at the latest when, at # 25, nobody worthy of a Wrestlemania main event was left (worthy in the McMahon sense).
For a horrible moment, I thought Hornswoggle was going to win, since he dwelled underneath the ring the whole time, until Finlay went backstage with him. You never know what a McMahon is capable of, right?
The final three were Batista, Triple H and, you guessed it, John Cena, who had no problem to singlehandedly create the worst Rumble finale ever. After Batista was out, all these two did was to exchange a series of failed Pedigree- and FU- attempts. And just when you thought ""for god's sake, do something else"", Cena FUs the King over the top rope.
John Cena returns in true Cena-style, celebrating the unworthiest Rumble win ever, with the help of the two moves of doom.

2008's Royal Rumble was indeed the only PPV I can remember that I was watching, and at the same time actively praying that no title would change hands. Because I think I would have broken out in tears if we were heading towards WrestleMania with Jeff Hardy and Rey Misterio as HEAVYWEIGHT champions!
Every match of the night, save for the Rumble and Orton versus Hardy maybe, seemed like it was improvised. If this was a play, you could rightfully ask whether the actors had any rehearsal at all.
The sloppyness of the matches reached a point where the audience didn't know anymore whether to cheer or to boo.
The new ring announcer, or commentator, or whatever he is, made a nice first impression by mispronouncing ""Jeff HarBy"".
You could cynically say the only well-organised portions of the PPV were the promos.

The Royal Rumbel match itself was booked perfectly, it tells a great story and great surprise ending.  Edge vs. Rey was by far the best match, other than the rumble, and it was fun to hear the crowd chant for edge.  So if you like Rey Jr. or edge buy this dvd.

MVP vs Ric Flair

I think this was there best match together and it was better than there Venegence match. MVP mostly dominated the match but Flair kept the crowd into it. The crowd was very into this match and it was better than expected. Good match. 7/10

JBL vs Chris Jericho

Jericho bled a lot in this match. I seen a botch in their but it was good. Although it ended in a dq ending it was good also. After the match Jericho beat JBL so hard and so much. The crowd was into this also to. Crowd gos crazy after the match. 8/10

World Heavywieght Match
Edge vs Rey Misterio

The crowd was into Edge all the way. This was preety good also. Although I wish there could have been more high flying from Rey but he acted like hes a technical wrestler. It did look like Rey was going to win but Edge came back and speared him in mid air. 7.5/10

WWE Championship match
Jeff Hardy vs Randy Orton

I didn't really like this match. This was a let down. They kept it very average and Hardy didn't even do that much exciting things. Yeah he did some things but it sure wasn't enough. Decent. 6/10

Royal Rumble
This was the best Rumble Ive seen so far. It was night of the match and it was so exciting. Every brought there a game. Hornswaggle brought comedy, there was a lot of big men in this Rumble. The surprise 30th entrant makes everyone in the building go crazy. 10/10

The Savior Chris Jericho went bezerk on JBL with a chair as part of a fued that I don't recall going much of anywhere and even the Rumble match lacked a bit of star-power after the Undertaker-Shawn Michaels left. Although the crowd did seem reasonably excited for the showdown between Triple H and John Cena. The part of the Rumble with Piper and Snuka was kinda sad two guys nearing sixty staggering around the ring getting their licks in on guys half their age before they where mercilessly eliminated by Kane.

3276419,4,B000ZIZXAO,"Career Threatening Match: MVP vs. Ric Flair

This match was fun. The special stipulation that Vince McMahon set up for all of Flair's matches in 2008 was that the first time he lost, it would be his retiring match. They played up the fact that MVP was disrespecting Flair and Flair well, plus the match was very well done, with a lot of back-and-forth action. Everything was fast-paced, and Flair even took some bumps, including a superplex and a sick big boot in the corner. The finish was swift and precise, and harkened back to earlier in the match when Flair locked in the Figure Four and had worked over MVP's leg. The only problem was the match was way too short. Match Rating: 4/5

Chris Jericho vs. JBL

There was actually a story behind this one. The month prior at Armageddon, JBL had cost Jericho the WWE Championship by getting Randy Orton disqualified when he intjerected himself into the match and nailed Jericho with a big boot while Jericho had Orton in the Walls of Jericho. JBL and Jericho then had a back-and-forth, very violent feud leading up to this match. The actual match was quite good, with Jericho and JBL nailing a lot of powerful moves with lots of excitement and counters thrown in. This match was also way too short and the ending, Jericho getting disqualified for smacking JBL with a chair, was just a bad idea. There was actually blood in this match though, a rare thing for WWE these days it seems, and the aftermath was pretty violent with Jericho smacking JBL with the chair again and choking the life out of him. Match Rating: 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (champion) (w/ Vickie Guerrero, Curt Hawkins, and Zack Ryder) vs. Rey Mysterio

Holy damn. This match was fast-paced and pretty epic throughout the entire thing. Rey was particularly amazing, hitting all of the sweet spots and being very unorthodox and original. He nailed a tornado DDT on Edge on the outside of the ring, and he also took a few bumps. Edge worked over Rey's leg for a lot of the match and he tried to cheat a couple of times, and the finish was also pretty good. Vickie Guerrero took the blunt of the 619 for Edge, and when Ray went to hit the West Coast Pop regardless, Edge Speared him in mid-air. Fantastic match and a fantastic finish. Match Rating: 5/5

WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (champion) vs. Jeff Hardy

Another great match. The crowd was really behind Jeff, and there was a lot of solid wrestling going on. Orton and Jeff took a few bumps, with Orton nailing the security barrier pretty damn hard at one point. There were a lot of near falls and Jeff nailed a sweet moonsault on the outside of the ring, though they messed up and only a tiny part of Jeff's leg actually hit Orton. The match did slow down at one point when the two men grappled in the center of the ring, which was disappointing since it's a Jeff Hardy match and it didn't really work well, but the finish was great. Jeff went for the Twist of Fate (after missing the Swanton Bomb), but Orton spun with it and nailed Hardy with the RKO to get the pinfall. Match Rating: 4/5

Royal Rumble Match

I was disappointed a little with this Rumble. There were no weapons or anything cool like that used throughout the whole thing, but there were quite a few highlights. Undertaker and HBK were the first two entrants, which was perfect considering they were the last two men in the ring at last year's Rumble. Shelton Benjamin leaping on top of the top turnbuckle was impressive, and the surprise appearances by Jimmy Snuka and Roddy Piper, as well as their mini-match, was also pretty cool. Undertaker went ballistic and leg dropped Snitsky through a table for really no reason, and the last three men, Batista, Triple H, and (surprise) John Cena, played their parts well. Triple H was the last man eliminated by John Cena nailing an FU to the outside of the ring as the two of them had a pretty impressive one on one battle for a while. Regardless of Cena's surprise appearance, Michaels and Undertaker really stole the show. Mick Foley being in a match without using any weapons was just sad, as well as the lack of hardcore action in general. Match Rating: 4/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

There were some funny moments with Santino Marella, Ashley, and Maria. Santino is great on the mic and he deserves more attention. Also, Ric Flair, Mr. Kennedy, Shawn Michaels, and Batista shared an epic segment in the locker room. There is also a scene with Vince McMahon, Hornswoggle, and Finlay, continuing the storyline that states that Hornswoggle is Vince McMahon's son. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS

The highlight of the Extras is really the Intercontinental Championship Match that took place between Orton and Hardy prior to the Rumble. Jeff's Swanton Bomb off the top of the Titan Tron was breathtaking and totally worth watching repeatedly. Extras Rating: 5/5",1246492800,,4857,4.653442240373396
3276420,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Ric Flair Vs. United States Champion M.V.P. - This was a good opener as it didn't bore the crowd. Flair looked a little off in the match but this is still better then their match from Vengeance. A nice opener but nothing really to mention here. 3/5

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield Vs. Chris Jericho - Bradshaw's first in-ring PPV since Judgment Day of 2006. The match came off more of a brawling and slugfest type of bout as we see from J.B.L. rather then a technical masterpiece we see from Jericho. It ends when a bloody Chris Jericho gets himself disqualified after hitting J.B.L. with a steel chair and then proceeds to choke out Bradshaw with a camera cable. A good Rumble return for both Chris Jericho and J.B.L. but isn't their best match. 3.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge Vs. Rey Mysterio - Edge was the huge favorite in this match as he got more cheers from the NYC crowd then Mysterio got. Edge targets Mysterio's knee a few minutes into the match to allow Rey not able to use his high flying offense against Edge. Rey was able to pull out new moves out of his bag of tricks to counter Edge that includes Rey sliding out of the ring to score with a DDT to Edge on the floor. After an interference from Vickie Guerrero (who gets a 619 for her troubles), Edge hits Rey with a spear out of mid-air for the win. 4/5 (Also Available On ""Edge: Decade Of Decadence"")

WWE Championship
Randy Orton Vs. Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy - This match had a big time buildup and feel to it. Orton and Hardy gave a great performance out there and they produced a very good WWE Title Match. The MSG crowd was very electric in this match as Hardy and Orton went back and forth against one another. In the end, Randy Orton hits a RKO out of nowhere and since Survivor Series against Shawn Michaels, Orton getting a clean WWE Title win. 4.5/5

30 Man Royal Rumble Match
This Rumble Match, unfortunately, didn't stick out like previous Rumbles in the past has done. The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels has very good showings after entering at #1 and #2. Batista is another that has a long perfromance showing in the match after entering at #8. This Rumble Match has many surprise entrants in Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Mick Foley, and the biggest in John Cena. The HHH and Cena face off in this Rumble Match reminded me of the Hulk Hogan/Ultimate Warrior face off from the Royal Rumble in 1990. After the #29 entrant, things begin to pick up and get more interesting. Again, this isn't a bad Rumble Match but it isn't one of the top Royal Rumble Matches. 4.5/5

Overall, this a nice Royal Rumble PPV to see. None of the matches were bad but they aren't anything special that will blow you away (besides the Orton/Hardy WWE Title Match). The Royal Rumble Match is good but it isn't one of the bests.",1243123200,,2795,4.4833005893909625

3276422,5,B000ZIZXAO,"2008 kicks off for the WWE with one of the biggest ppv's of the year: the Royal Rumble. As always, this show is billed as the place where we begin the ""Road to Wrestlemania."" The much anticipated Royal Rumble match will determine the main event for Wrestlemania. This DVD provides the show in full and has a bonus match from Raw.

THE SHOW
* Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs. MVP. Flair gives a good brief speech before the match, which gets the crowd fired up. These two give a better performance than their last meeting at Vengeance in June 2007. This is a good opener, with the hot New York crowd boosting this from a decent match to a good match.

* Mr. McMahon discusses the Rumble Match with Hornswoggle.

* Chris Jericho vs. JBL. These two give a good brawl. It is certainly not a wrestling match. JBL hasn't wrestled on ppv since Judgment Day of 2006, and he seems a bit rusty. However, the technical failings are covered up by some fun hardcore brutality. Jericho's big return seems to have fizzled quickly. :(

* Ashley tries to talk to Maria.

* World Championship: Edge (c) vs. Rey Mysterio. After winning the belt back last month at Armageddon, Edge defends his title against Mysterio. These two have always had good chemistry. Having been tag champs together, they know each other well. The match is enjoyable, but Edge never seems in danger of losing. The match ends with a cool looking spot.

* Ric Flair in his locker room. Good interactions with Kennedy, HBK, Batista, and Triple H.

* Maria's Kiss Cam. Ashley & Maria tease the annual Playboy shoot. This would be a failing boring segment if it weren't for Santino's humor. He's just really entertaining to watch.

* WWE Championship: Randy Orton (c) vs. Jeff Hardy. Following his upset victory at Armageddon, Jeff gets his first ppv title shot. The crowd is clearly behind him. Orton and Jeff were okay together, but seem to lack the strong energy needed to put on an amazing match. The suspense at the end is agonizing. There was a real feel that Jeff might actually win the title. The fans really wanted it, but they were denied.

* 2008 Royal Rumble match. This year's rumble was fun. The two to start it were the two that ended it last year. Throughout the match, we got a lot of good moments. The New York crowd really helped this match. There were some good surprise entrants, like Foley, Roddy Piper, and Jimmy Snuka. Now, the ending... despite how people complain about it now, just listen to the reaction when Cena arrives. It was easily the biggest surprise in ages, and the crowd's initial reaction tells it all. Its a lot of fun to watch the final three face off. This match had a good start and a good ending. The middle was a little slower this year, but certainly not bad.

EXTRAS
* Raw 1/14/08 - Intercontinental Championship: Jeff Hardy (c) vs. Randy Orton.

* Home Video Exclusive: Triple H talks to John Cena post Royal Rumble match.

Overall, this was a really fun show. The Rumble always adds some excitement to a show. Once again, some young wrestlers got to challenge for the World titles. Cena made a surprise return, and Jeff showed he had what it takes to be a main eventer.",1212019200,,3176,4.542907180385289

3276437,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Ric Flair vs. M.V.P. - It was a nice opening match that didn't bore me like their Vengeance match but past that, nothing really to mention here.

Chris Jericho vs. J.B.L. - The in-ring return of J.B.L. to PPV since Judgment Day 2006.  I thought it was just me but by reading the other reviews, I'm not alone here in that they seemed to be somewhat off & lacking that ""it"" to make this just anything past an ok match.  Maybe it was Bradshaw's ring rust but who really knows.  The best part of the match was everything that happened afterwards.

World Champion Edge vs. Rey Mysterio - Before I get started, I liked the fact that Michael Cole didn't ignore history & put over the fact that they were former WWE Tag Team Champions together...and an interesting trivia note is that they lost those titles in the exact same arena, MSG.  The match saw Edge (who had a heavy amount of fan support) target Mysterio's knee after the first couple of mins. resulting in Mysterio using other moves like him sliding under the bottom rope & hooking Edge for a DDT all in one motion.  Edge won after a spear on Mysterio who was in the middle of a top rope springboard.  The first ""better than average"" match of the night.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Jeff Hardy - This match had a big match buildup & feel to it.  They gave it their all here & showcased a performance that had the crowd going back & forth more than they had any other time of the night with Orton getting the victory after a RKO out of nowhere.  Orton got the strong performance & CLEAN PPV victory he's been needing since becoming champion.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - Before I get started again, that's was an awesome promotional ""by the numbers"" video WWE did on the match itself.  Unfortunally, this Rumble fell kind of flat as it was really lacking standout Rumble moments with some questionable & poor booking...like Finlay being disqualified for using a weapon (yet the Rumble went hardcore in 2001 & 2003).  Some things happened that got my attention like HBK, Taker, and to a lower extent Batista's long performances & the suprizes of Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, and John Cena.  Love or hate him, props to WWE for being able to keep that secret from leaking out.  It wasn't as boring as previous Rumbles have been but it's not one I would put on my top list either.

DVD extras are a backstage confrontation between Cena & Triple H along with the huge swanton bomb Hardy did to Orton on RAW. As a side note, it would have been sweet if they had one of those ""behind the scenes"" of the commercial things because that was one of the most entertaining WWE PPV commercials in recent memory.

So overall, this Rumble didn't have a bad match but it didn't really have any that would blow you away either past the Orton/Hardy match.  It was an average PPV that I recommend for a rental & see from there.",1204588800,6,2856,4.426386233269598

When he arrived at the Rumble, people initially thought he was a guest backstage.  His return was amazing and done perfectly.  All the other matches on here were nothing less than great.  The Jeff Hardy one stands out.  Of course he wasn't gonna win the match, but being in the main event at the RR is an honor and proved that he can hang with the best of them.  He will probably win the title somewhere down the line this year or early next year if he keeps this up.",1204156800,,677,4.007462686567164

Flair's Career On The Line
Ric Flair Vs. MVP
This was a pretty steady match considering how old Flair is now, it was an ok opening match but it doesnt come close to any classic Ric Flair match. Rating 3/5

JBL Vs. Chris Jericho
This match was ok it just wasn't long enough for me, all this match was used for was to further the storyline of jericho vs. jbl. I don't mind them trying to further the storyline but at one of your four biggest pay per views of the year that should not be the only concern you should also try to put on a entertaining match especially for the fans at home that paid to watch.

World Heavyweight Championship
Rey Mysterio Vs. Edge (C)
Now this match was exciting although I think any world title match should be at least 20 minutes and I didn't really like the ending but it does set up another match between the 2. While this match is far from a classic it is also far from awful. Rating 4/5

Jeff Hardy Vs. Randy Orton
Ok other than the actual rumble match this is the best of the night. These guys put on a good show, I think they should've been given a little more time but it was still a good solid title match. Rating 4/5

Royal Rumble Match
This was exciting as it is each year, and of course as many of you know John Cena made his surprise return to the WWE ahead of schedule as he was supposed to be out 6-8 months and he was only gone since october. I won't spoil anything else for whoever out there hasn't seen it yet but the dvd is worth owning if you love the rumble. Rating 5/5",1201651200,7,1988,4.166666666666667
3276440,5,B000ZIZXAO,"I'll just start by saying, this is the best WWE PPV since last WM.

Ric Flair vs MVP (Career Threatening match for Ric Flair)
A pretty slow-paced match. Ended in a Playmaker countered to a Figure-4 Leg Lock in which MVP tapped out. MVP gave two violent big boots to Flair. No cheating by either side is the biggest dissapointment. 2.5/5

Chris Jericho vs JBL
Lack of spots is the biggest fault in this match. Also I didn't buy this feud from the start. Best part was when they botched a Bulldog and the crowd booed loudly. Ends with Jericho DQing himself, and then strangling JBL with a cord. 3/5

Edge vs Rey Mysterio (World Heavyweight Title)
A few high-flying moves by Mysterio, and a couple of more powerful moves by Edge, including a powerslam. Ending was O.K. although many see it as a screwjob. Vickie takes the 619 for Edge, Edge mid-air Spears Mysterio. That was awesome. 4/5

Randy Orton vs Jeff Hardy (WWE Title)
An instant match of the year candidate. Many high-flying moves by Hardy. The best part about this is that finally, a heel wins with a clean finish. Jeff gives Orton a violent kick which sends him crashing to the security wall. It ends with Orton countering Jeff's Twist of Fate to an RKO. 5/5

The Royal Rumble Main Event
Wow... the WWE creative team should be killed for this. Cena comes back and wins the rumble. They could've let HHH win it but no. The one everyone hates comes back and wins it. Otherwise this was my favorite rumble match of all-time. But that bloody Cena comes... why can't he just go somewhere and die in peace. That takes 1 point from an otherwise awesome match. 4/5

You said there was nobody left in the ring worthy of a mania title shot so that meant Cena was coming out??? haha, Batista and Triple H were still in there buddy, and incase you didn't know, they are good to go as far as main eventing mania is concerned.",1201478400,,536,4.264705882352941
3276442,3,B000ZIZXAO,"Someone who didn't watch WWE since they changed their name may be surprised, and most likely quite irritated, by the names who headline major WWE events nowadays. And their irritation is not quite unjustified.
People like Randy Orton, Edge or John Cena lacks a certain punch - or in the case of Cena, everything - compared to the likes of Michaels, Triple H, Jericho or The Undertaker.
And to this day I would rather turn in for Ric Flair than Edge or Orton.

Ric Flair opened with his carreer-ending match against MVP. Seeing Flair and Charles Robinson in the same ring brought back memories of the late WCW. I realise this has little to do with this event, but as the event has little to do with old WWF, it may be worth mentioning.
That were good times in WCW, before it turned into RAW light, when Robinson was Flair's personal (gimmick-) referee, which led to a feud with Roddy Piper and Randy Savage, culminating in a match at Slamboree between Robinson and Savage's female protege Gorgeous George for the Macho Man's carreer. That was entertainment, that was witty.
Enertaining, witty ... so I was right, this has nothing to do with WWE.
To witness in this match.
It was a perfect examination for those who want to know why WWE lacks grand character in this era. Look at Ric Flair, even at his age it's all about flow, performance and credibility. Now look at MVP, all fancy moves and posing, but no flow, no character; just move after move. Flair outperformed him in every aspect.
Had this been Flair's last match, it would have been, lightly put, a disgrace.
And it starts a series of mishaps throughout all matches. (2/5)

Next one on the card was Jericho Vs JBL. This promised as much as Wrestlemania 22's Chris Benoit Vs JBL, with the additional bonus of having an intense storyline. It was one of those matches who have no real start and no real ending, and therefor no real climax. The crowd wasn't into this at all, continuing the atmospheric downfall of the Flair match.
And it continued the series of half-cooked spots and inexplicable mishaps. At the match's supposed climax, Jericho fumbles his running facebuster, which caused the audience to boo.
The DQ ending in favour of JBL didn't help the atmoshpere either. Not even Jericho's retaliation. (2/5)

Edge Vs Rey Misterio. Rey Misterio. Let me ask the booking team the following: do you have *any* idea why it's called HEAVYWEIGHT championship? At least it's consistent with the credibility of having John Cena as the leader of the company.
Rey has fantastic abilities, Edge, undoubtly, has talent. This match, however, doesn't showcase it. If you consider for a moment what high-paced athletes these two usually are, this match was as slow as a match between Khali and Mark Henry. The two R-Rated no-names acting as Edge's bodyguards are useless as well.
At this point of the Royal Rumble, the sloppyness of the matches was really apparent. Rey fumbles no less than three Hurancanranas, and Rey and Edge seemed very irritated by one another.
And of course nobody expected Vicky Guerrero to interfere ... (2/5)

Oh, and we're treated to the first-ever ""Royal Rumble Kiss-Cam"". Great, as if the atmosphere wasn't cold enough!

Jeff Hardy Vs Randy Orton was the only decent, well-paced match of the evening, with a satisfying end. And apparently the WWE Title works just as well without John Cena. Never was the phrase ""You can't see me!"" more useful.
Make no mistake, the match was nowhere near the quality a match for the WWE Title at a Royal Rumble should have, but looking at surrounding events, it's probably as good as it currently gets. (3/5)

Now on to the Royal Rumble match. Michael Buffer gave the event a glamour that wasn't at all present in the last two hours. Nevertheless, a cool way to start (Buffer used to announce all WCW PPV main events, so that brought back some memories).
First impressions first: what Taker (#1) and Michaels (#2) showed in the first three minutes clearly outclassed anything we've seen thus far.
This Rumble was in my opinion the best of the last few years because there was always something going on, and the eliminations were well-placed. To my great joy, the crowd yelled ""You can't wrestle!"" as The Great Khali entered. Thank god he survived only a minute.
The Rumble could have been a great joy, but with John Cena in the equation, it was all more or less predetermined.
I knew Cena was coming back, it was no great mystery if you strictly follow the Cena-logic: he always has the biggest venue despite his patently limited skills and he can only come in as # 30 because he can't handle being in a Rumble.
Even though I knew it before the event, you knew it at the latest when, at # 25, nobody worthy of a Wrestlemania main event was left (worthy in the McMahon sense).
For a horrible moment, I thought Hornswoggle was going to win, since he dwelled underneath the ring the whole time, until Finlay went backstage with him. You never know what a McMahon is capable of, right?
The final three were Batista, Triple H and, you guessed it, John Cena, who had no problem to singlehandedly create the worst Rumble finale ever. After Batista was out, all these two did was to exchange a series of failed Pedigree- and FU- attempts. And just when you thought ""for god's sake, do something else"", Cena FUs the King over the top rope.
John Cena returns in true Cena-style, celebrating the unworthiest Rumble win ever, with the help of the two moves of doom.

2008's Royal Rumble was indeed the only PPV I can remember that I was watching, and at the same time actively praying that no title would change hands. Because I think I would have broken out in tears if we were heading towards WrestleMania with Jeff Hardy and Rey Misterio as HEAVYWEIGHT champions!
Every match of the night, save for the Rumble and Orton versus Hardy maybe, seemed like it was improvised. If this was a play, you could rightfully ask whether the actors had any rehearsal at all.
The sloppyness of the matches reached a point where the audience didn't know anymore whether to cheer or to boo.
The new ring announcer, or commentator, or whatever he is, made a nice first impression by mispronouncing ""Jeff HarBy"".
You could cynically say the only well-organised portions of the PPV were the promos.
Outside of the Rumble, almost all the opponents were so confusingly irritated by each other that it was baffling.

The three stars are for the good Rumble and the sheer John Cena entertainment value.",1201478400,7,6480,4.68804920913884

The Royal Rumbel match itself was booked perfectly, it tells a great story and great surprise ending.  Edge vs. Rey was by far the best match, other than the rumble, and it was fun to hear the crowd chant for edge.  So if you like Rey Jr. or edge buy this dvd.  For any big WWE fans: you have to get this because it is one of the best rumbles of all time.",1201392000,,445,3.752688172043011

MVP vs Ric Flair

I think this was there best match together and it was better than there Venegence match. MVP mostly dominated the match but Flair kept the crowd into it. The crowd was very into this match and it was better than expected. Good match. 7/10

JBL vs Chris Jericho

Jericho bled a lot in this match. I seen a botch in their but it was good. Although it ended in a dq ending it was good also. After the match Jericho beat JBL so hard and so much. The crowd was into this also to. Crowd gos crazy after the match. 8/10

World Heavywieght Match
Edge vs Rey Misterio

The crowd was into Edge all the way. This was preety good also. Although I wish there could have been more high flying from Rey but he acted like hes a technical wrestler. It did look like Rey was going to win but Edge came back and speared him in mid air. 7.5/10

WWE Championship match
Jeff Hardy vs Randy Orton

I didn't really like this match. This was a let down. They kept it very average and Hardy didn't even do that much exciting things. Yeah he did some things but it sure wasn't enough. Decent. 6/10

Royal Rumble
This was the best Rumble Ive seen so far. It was night of the match and it was so exciting. Every brought there a game. Hornswaggle brought comedy, there was a lot of big men in this Rumble. The surprise 30th entrant makes everyone in the building go crazy. 10/10
