1969241,3,B00013RC7U,Having lived in (West) Berlin just before this happened I wanted to see the movie.  It was interesting but certainly nothing deserving praise.  It was just interesting.,1362873600,,168,5.185185185185185
1969242,3,B00013RC7U,"I chose to watch this movie because it's based on actual events that took place in 1978:  an East German couple, after being unable to flee to the West with forged passports, decide to hijack a plane from Poland to Berlin-Templehof, which during the Cold War was a US Air Force Base.  The acting is OK all throughout this movie, with the German actors playing their rolls authentically, but the overall production of this movie, both audio and video, feel very amateurish.

Sean Penn's roll is a very minor roll.  He hardly speaks much, as he's nothing more than a young man and father who happens to be a passenger on the hijacked plane, and opportunistically decides to stay in the West despite his ailing mother left behind in East Germany.  We never learn much more about his fate.

Department of Defense personnel in Germany debriefed (in the movie ""interrogated"" is used, which is wrong) refugees that were of military or state interest that came from Warsaw Pact countries.  high profile personnel were often granted US asylum if the US government felt their information was critical.  While the military personnel in this movie are portrayed as ueber-patriotic people, Sheen plays an overly constitution-conscious lawyer whose only interest is the humane and democratic trial-by-jury of the detained German family.

There isn't much character development in this movie.  The plot seems to focus on Martin Sheen's character, an ambitious prosecutor who has taken big league politicians down in the past, and who once again takes on the government and wins.  No one expects this case to go bad, either, and it doesn't.

I did like the scenes around Berlin.  They are authentic 1970s Berlin, but despite the realism of the surroundings, lacks all thrill and suspense.  It's not much of a courtroom drama, either.  We can only be glad the German family and the passengers who opted to stay in the West were able to be set free without retribution by the East Germans.  That this happens is no surprise as their wasn't much suspense in the first place.",1348358400,3,2055,4.878962536023055
1969243,1,B00013RC7U,"Exactly why anyone would bother to put a film of this poor quality out on a blu-ray disc completely evades me.  The video quality and audio quality are both unbelievably bad.  I purchase blu-ray discs at least partly for the experience provided by the normally outstanding video and audio quality of the discs themselves.  The movie itself has the feel of the cheap, made for television flick that is is, although I don't ever recall seeing a movie of any sort of this recent a vintage that both looked and sounded so bad.  The production of this film is 80's cheese at its worst.  The color is terrible.  If the blu-ray is this poor I can't imagine how bad it must have been in other formats.  I have VHS tapes created using the slowest recording speed that look better than this on the big screen.  The quality is so poor it really should come with a warning on the label.  Avoid this one.",1325203200,,891,4.41717791411043
1969244,1,B00013RC7U,"I received this BD recently and am very disappointed in the picture video.
Frankly, it looks little better than a VHS tape.

I don't know what happened here, but it is unfortunate.
This is a fine film and deserves a better presentation.",1301097600,4,236,4.619047619047619
1969245,5,B00013RC7U,"I viewed it before many times over, and this time, twenty years past, I still am exhilarated with its pointers on international politics, fighting tyranny, asserting one's rights, and of course, having a conscientious judge played well by Martin Sheen.",1285545600,3,252,5.325
1969246,5,B00013RC7U,"Based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-book-with-the-same-title/dp/0451155661/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a book with the same title</a>, this film tells an unusual story that really happened.

Until 1991 Berlin was formally under 4-power Allied military occupation. In the later years of the Cold War no one really paid much attention to that: The Soviet Zone, East Berlin, was the capital of the German Democratic Republic. West Berlin was essentially a part of West Germany with the French, British and U.S. zones combined as single municipality.

Then a hijacked airliner--taken over by nice people fleeing Communist subjugation--landed at Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin.

Nice hijackers are still hijackers and the commies demanded their return. Suddenly West Berlin was an allied military zone again. Neither the West German nor the West Berlin governments would touch the issue. The Germans reminded all that the occupation was technically still in effect. Since Tempelhof was in the U.S. Zone, it was for the United States to handle the case.

And that is what this movie is about. The U.S. set up a unique court in the American Zone of Allied Occupied Berlin. The judge--played by Martin Sheen--was a federal judge from New Jersey. The fascinating part of the story is how remarkably complex it was to set up that court and adjudicate the case.

The made-for-television Judgement in Berlin was filmed where it happened. It is no work of art but the story is an extraordinary and true legal tale.",1226880000,9,1552,5.504201680672269
1969247,5,B00013RC7U,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW GIVES AWAY PART OF THE ENDING. I HAVE PUT THREE ASTERISKS BEFORE AND AFTER THAT PART OF THE REVIEW.

I just found a copy of ""Judgment in Berlin"" (1988), which stars Martin Sheen, Sean Penn, and Carl Lumbly (Syney Bristow's partner in the TV-series ""Alias""), among others. It's an excellent story, co-written and directed by Leo Penn (Sean's father).

Synopsis: Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, an East German man hijacks a plane bound for East Berlin and diverts it to West Berlin. Because he did not merely escape but committed hijacking, which the US government claims is ""terrorism,"" he must stand trial in West Berlin in a specially-constituted American court.

The government argues, among other things, that constitutional rights do not apply since the court is an ""occupation court"" which is a tool of the Department of State in its exercise of foreign policy, not an independent ""Article 2"" federal court.

((DON'T READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE END!)) ***The judge disagrees and in the end refuses to allow the defendant to be put into the hands of the government at all since he says he believes them when they say they won't respect his rights.***

Many of the legal arguments and aspects in the film mirror those being used today in US detentions and prosecutions both in the US and overseas. (For example, ""unlawful enemy combatants"" held in the US in military brigs, Guantanamo detainees, and several cases of American citizens held by the US and being prosecuted in Iraq.)

In other words, the film is accurate in its legal and political framework. The film, moreover, raises the same moral questions often NOT being raised or considered now in cases analogous to the one in the movie. The film is an excellent teaching tool about these issues.

Not an exciting action film, just a straightforward story, it is nonetheless a good script, good directing, and good acting.  Sheen plays the judge quite well. Penn does a good job playing a young German who testifies for the defense (as someone who lived in Austria as a child, I thought his accent was pretty good).  Young Lumbly does equally well as a prosecutor.  Others in the cast, all fine.

8006106,5,B00013RC7U,"If you have ever been interested in movies/stories about East/West German relations, escapes, politics, etc., this will interest you intensely.  I found it was very stimulating and Martin Sheen, I felt, did his best performance of all.  He did many horror movies, but he really missed his calling in life by doing them.  He did the best job with this -- my humble opinion.",1391385600,,372,4.78125
8006107,4,B00013RC7U,"Martin Sheen plays Judge Herbert Stern. He must make the most difficult ruling of his career in a legal battle behind the Iron Curtain. In 1978 (true story) Helmut Thiele, desparate for freedom, hijacks a Polish airliner bound for East Berlin, forcing the pilots to change course and land at an American air base in Wesy Germany. Once the plane is on US soil the real drama begins with a court trial. Do you punish a man for doing whatever it takes to escape oppression, even if it means breaking the law? In an American court in Berlin it is up to Judge Stern to make this life or death decision.",1373068800,,597,4.387387387387387
