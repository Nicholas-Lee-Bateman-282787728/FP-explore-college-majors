6680560,5,B00NUTFLCU,"Majority of the segments are a repeat from many different BBC documentaries that I have seen within last few years. What was interesting to notice once all these misfits came together is evolution which has caused the misfit in the first place. Watching those pandas eat sixteen hours a day, forty pounds of bamboo at a time as well as the only green mammal on earth, sloths where they have the slowest digestion of any mammal, hardy eat any leaves since it takes them two weeks to process a single meal, it all becomes about expending energy which requires them to do less. No wonder grizzly bears get to hibernate few months out of the year after few weeks of pure salmon protein feast while pandas have to stay out in the cold and eat that empty calorie bamboo year round.

The Black Footed Albatross fledglings had quite a while to take off into the air with out Ending up as shark food.",1517875200,,290,4.388888888888889
8680355,5,B00NUTFLCU,"The magnificent photography and the interesting choice of animal kingdom subjects makes this perfect family viewing  with just one or two small provisos.

There are two modest scenes of mating  one involving pandas and the other involving chameleons. These might cause young children to ask, What are they doing, Mommy? If you're not ready to have that conversation, you might want to hold off on showing this DVD. Also, there is one brief scene of successful predation involving young albatrosses. Theres nothing grisly about the scene though, so it shouldnt present a problem for children.

The other proviso is that the narrator purveys a bit of dubious science right at the beginning of the DVD, in the section again involving pandas. He points out that pandas are very slow to reproduce He goes on to attribute their infrequent mating to the fact that they eat only bamboo, and because bamboo has so little nutritional value, they have to keep chomping away most of their waking hours. This means they go through a lot of bamboo. He seems to conclude that pandas consequently keep their numbers low so that they won't decimate their bamboo supply.

Most evolutionary biologists would probably disagree with that statement. Such motivated population control implies that the pressures of natural selection work on the level of groups. That thinking has generally been superseded by biologists who instead see selection pressures working only on the level of the gene (Dawkins) or on the level of the individual (Gould). If you want to read an interesting, impartial summary of the differences between these views  I recommend reading The Extended Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, starting around Page 146.

But other than that little lapse, this DVD is amazing and amusing. See how even a certain kind of stalk-eyed fly has an astounding repertoire that includes a macho display between males, as they literally measure-up each other.

The DVD also gives support to young people who might be feeling pressured to conform to established norms. It lends encouragement to those who would prefer to creatively go their own way  in vivid color.",1488153600,,2143,5.065340909090909
8680356,5,B00NUTFLCU,"This is one of my favorite animal documentaries.
It is fun and lighthearted, showcasing many unique animals.  There is only one scene that may be considered scary to younger or more sensitive audiences which shows birds being grabbed by sharks as they attempt to fly for the first time.  Other than that it is very lighthearted and shows the uniqueness still left in the world.

This documentary brought my attention to the Kakapo, an endangered parrot in New Zealand, which I am now actively following the breeding and recovery group.  So glad to have been made aware of this unique bird and learned so much about many unique animals.

I always love the PBS nature shows and highly recommend this one!",1469318400,,702,4.768595041322314
