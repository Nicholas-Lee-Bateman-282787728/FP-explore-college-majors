8295970,5,B001E1820E,"A great momento of a classic year at Wimbledon

A Landmark Year at Wimbledon for Rafa Nadal fans as he won his 1st title there in that classic 5 setter that ended in twilight due to the rain delays that will never occur again as Wimbledon has a roof now so this is really a piece of history.

A really good film, covers lots of players, men & women as they progress towards the final, a great momento to remember a vintage year at Wimbledon.

I must just tell Rafa fans about this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;it's got 80 poems in about how us fans feel about him, the highs the lows and his lovely humble personality and his sexy looks, and the other poems about love are good too.",1298419200,2,877,5.340579710144928
8295971,5,B001E1820E,"This film is very well put together & shows excerpts from many matches in both the ladies & mens as they get closer to the final, it gives you the true feel of how the Championships progressed coming to the climax with the mens final between Federer & Nadal which has been refered to as ""Rafa's Triumph at Twighlight""

It was a true classic for many reasons: it didn't finish till about 9pm due to rain delays & it was a 5 set thriller which John McEnroe called ""The Greatest Match of all time"" It was emotional, nailbiting and was a treat for Rafa's fans as he finally won Wimbledon for the 1st time after losing in the Final to Federer the previous 2 years in a row.

If you're a Tennis Fan this is a great Souvenir.

Rafa fans will also love the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;as it has a long chapter called ""A Fan's Feelings"" of 80 poems about Rafa, his career, his personality & his good looks (& the rest of the book is brilliant too) No Rafa fan should be without it!",1298419200,2,1168,5.010309278350515

Being the tennis lover that I am-I would definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks again and if you have anymore videos of this type,I would be very interested. Even though I watched this final last year on TV-it's nice to have my own copy to watch over and over. The match between Nadal and Federer was awesome.",1237507200,,459,4.679012345679013
