7812946,1,6301606906,Absolutely low budget flick and not worth watching. Viggo Mortensen has a cameo role and a few lines. But it is a pity to watch.,1326672000,,128,4.16
7812947,4,6301606906,"This had Class B written all over it, yet it was still very entertaining and not a bad action film. For an R-rated film, it was surprisingly free of some things you normally see and hear. Some of the scenes in the bars were crude and the beginning had Rambo-like violence with little credibility, but the majority of this was a well-done film.

A big thing it had going for it: it should keep everyone's interest all the way. It certainly did with me. This is an unknown movie, a real ""sleeper."" You can kind of guess that since there are only three of us who have reviewed it, as of this writing.

The opening scene is real attention-grabber: six minutes of almost no dialog and some intense action.

The lead actor, Terrence Knox, is not someone I was familiar with, but he was okay. I was sorry David Warner didn't have more lines as he's usually interesting and I was surprised Yaphet Kotto's character kept his cool. I kept waiting for him to blow up.

Note: the cover on the VHS box is misleading. They show the hero being dragged by a truck. In the film, that happens to the bad guy, not him.",1244246400,,1099,4.3463414634146345
