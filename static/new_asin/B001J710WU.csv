3652655,4,B001J710WU,My 16 year old daughter's fave! Lol. She loves to bake and recalled this episode while decorating heart cookies for a party. I watched it with her and caught myself singing along to the songs too. Great characters and setting. Fit the Valentine's theme to the tee!,1403568000,2,264,4.638297872340425
3652656,4,B001J710WU,Renting the seasonal holiday Barney Movies has become a tradition at our house. The kids love the predictable songs and upbeat songs! This one often triggers other family activities such as making valentine boxes and decorating heart shaped cookies!,1394323200,2,249,5.410256410256411
3652657,5,B001J710WU,"I remember Barney from when I was growing up, and I'm really surprised at how his messages are still on point.  Except sometimes when they talk about boomboxes.  Otherwise, though, the themes could have been done today.",1387497600,3,219,4.891891891891892
3652658,4,B001J710WU,Barney always keeps the kids occupied!!! Love how they use their imagination!  My four year old daughter loves this Valentine's Barney movie!,1362700800,2,141,5.409090909090909

3652660,2,B001J710WU,"On February 14, 2017 I purchased this title to stream & like many others, my family was disappointed to find the description was not accurate as no other titles or bonus materials were included.  Hopefully Amazon will either correct the description, make the additional offerings available to stream or offer a refund in the future.  As of this review, Amazon still hasn't modified the title's description for streaming purchase or changed the price.  The video itself was classic Charlie Brown & enjoyable as ever, just wish the streaming title description had not been so misleading - wouldn't have purchased it considering the price, would have just ordered the DVD.",1489104000,5,669,5.1192660550458715
3652661,5,B001J710WU,Really funny. I really enjoyed this one.,1487376000,3,40,4.857142857142857
3652662,1,B001J710WU,Not as described! You only get the one 25 minute episode. WAY OVER PRICED.,1487289600,3,74,4.357142857142857
3652663,1,B001J710WU,Not as advertised!!,1487030400,3,19,5.666666666666667
3652664,3,B001J710WU,"As the other reviews say below, this is only for the first episode, be my valentine, Charlie brown.  It's fine, but we bought it for the other two and didn't see the reviews until after we purchased it.  Amazon refunded us.  But until they've fixed it, I'd steer clear of this one...",1487030400,2,283,4.403846153846154
3652665,1,B001J710WU,"I love the show, but this is supposed to be a deluxe edition with more than just the 25 min show. I would not have purchased it at 9.99 for just the one show had I known.",1487030400,3,170,3.6216216216216215
3652666,2,B001J710WU,"Not what's advertised and way over priced for what is actually available: a 25 mins. Charlie Brown special with no extras.

I buy a TON off of amazon and instant video, but this purchase is really frustrating.",1486944000,8,209,4.648648648648648
3652667,5,B001J710WU,"pricey purchase, but worth it. My son loves Charlie brown and the quality of the program is extremely high end. We will watch again and again.",1486944000,2,142,4.5
3652668,2,B001J710WU,"ADDED: I contacted Amazon Customer Service. They agree there is a problem. They are going to try to resolve the issue, either by making the entire listed content available or by correcting the description.

The description says that the runtime is 25 minutes. This is accurate.

The description also says that it is a ""deluxe edition,"" and says that in addition to ""Be My Valentine,"" it also includes ""bonus episodes It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown and You're in Love, Charlie Brown, and the special documentary featurette, Unlucky in Love: An Unrequited Love Story.""

That's NOT accurate. It does not. They are not included.

I was misled. I thought that for $9.99 I would be getting the equivalent of a DVD, which would be good value. At $9.99 for a single 25-minute program, I don't think it is.

I hope Amazon will either correct the description (and lower the price), or that they will look to see whether they made some mistake and whether there is a technical issue that could be corrected.",1486771200,10,1001,4.763005780346821
