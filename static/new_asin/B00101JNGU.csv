3044756,1,B00101JNGU,"Review on Get Rid of Sciatic Pain for Good with Kathi Casey

My suggestion is Do NOT BUY THIS DVD unless you are in the upper 2% percentile of athletic prowess. Four people witnessed this DVD with me. One a yoga teacher, one a Tai Chi teacher, and two English teachers and myself a Teacher Trainer for Art Teachers who wish to teach in the public schools. The presentation is misleading and irresponsible. I was very disappointed. The presentation does not take into consideration the audience she is marketing the tape to reach and help. She gives no simple lead in exercises that someone with painful sciatica can do. Her presentation ignores the first and most important aspect of teaching. Know your audience, communicate to their needs, and present levels of entry that are reachable.

Her approach is friendly, and she is probably a very nice person, and she probably meant well. She exhibits the fact that she knows and can do yoga on very high level. She is very flexible.

I just need information from someone who is more conscious in her teaching. I have done gentle yoga off and on for years, but my sciatica is painful and Kathi Casey gives no real entry yoga postures. Most of her exercises would be better received if she included using a chair or props that would in reality be much safer, easier and doable at the beginning when simple moves create more sciatic.  One of her poses, I have myself done on the edge of my bed for years. It is a helpful pose, but it has not cured my sciatica.

The following 4 misleading marketing statements are on the outside casing of the DVD I purchased for $14.95. I wish I could get my money back.

""Three Simple Exercises that anyone can do!"" Who and where are those people who have a painful case of sciatica or no sciatica and are capable of doing the difficult exercises presented on this video when just bending over or taking a step can create sciatic pain.

""Get Relief From Sciatic Pain Now!"" I do not think so, not with her presentation.

""These Exercises Really Work"" On whom, the 2% who can do what she can do.

3044780,5,B00101JNGU,"In hopes of controlling the pain from my sciatic problem, I decided to check out this DVD in spite of its mixed reviews.

Kathi Casey's three exercises (combined with deep breathing to bring oxygen to the area of concern) are designed to stretch the piriformis muscle that goes across the butt (as well as other muscles). When that muscle gets tense or tight, it puts pressure on the sciatic nerve and causes pain. In some cases of sciatica, the pain is relieved or avoided by the stretching of this muscle. She advocates doing the exercise program daily, whether a sciatic problem is active or not.

One Amazon reviewer focused on how impossible it is for the average person to do these exercises. After reviewing the DVD, I find that assessment very puzzling. First of all, Casey makes it clear that you do not need to do all three exercises, but just one or two of them. Secondly, she shows variations of the first two in order to accommodate different fitness levels. I am 65 years old, do not have a flexible body, and have not done a regular yoga routine in 35 years. I have no trouble doing at least ""very modified"" versions of her first two exercises (not always bending as far forward as she does, etc.), and doing her third exercise sufficiently. If someone is ""heavy-set"" and/or has a REALLY inflexible body, maybe they can't do any of these exercises (as modified), but I have to imagine that most people can do at least one or two of them (as modified).

Kathi Casey, who demonstrates the exercises, is not a super-model and the DVD, while ""adequate,"" is not some hi-tech production filmed on the shores of Hawaii. WHO CARES? The film quality is reasonable, the purpose behind the exercises is well explained, and the exercises are sufficiently demonstrated, with very good instructions. And if they work....well, they work. That is what is important to me.

I just got the DVD from Amazon and watched a couple of times, while doing the exercises. Frankly, my sciatic problem is caused by a herniated disc, so I am not sure how much it will be helped by stretching the piriformis muscle. For people whose sciatic problem is caused by a tight piriformis muscle (piriformis syndrome), this DVD would progbably be more helpful. I would guess that stretching the piriformis muscle, and other muscles the exercises relate to, would be helpful ""to some degree"" for anyone that has sciatica. (Another DVD that would probably be more helpful for bulging or herniated disc and sciatica [among other back problems] is ""Yoga Therapy for Back Pain"" with Emily Kligerman. Some of Kligerman's poses are similar to stretches given to me by my chiropractor & my osteopathic physician, just with more movement and less time ""holding"" the position.)",1297036800,52,2744,4.79492600422833

When that muscle gets tense or tight, it puts pressure on the sciatic nerve and causes pain. In some cases of sciatica, the pain is relieved or avoided by the stretching of this muscle. She advocates doing the exercise program daily, whether a sciatic problem is active or not.

One Amazon reviewer focused on how impossible it is for the average person to do these exercises. After reviewing the DVD, I find that assessment very puzzling. First of all, Casey makes it clear that you do not need to do all three exercises, but just one or two of them. Secondly, she shows variations of the first two in order to accommodate different fitness levels. I am 65 years old, do not have a flexible body, and have not done a regular yoga routine in 35 years. I have no trouble doing at least ""very modified"" versions of her first two exercises (not always bending as far forward as she does, etc.), and doing her third exercise sufficiently. If someone is ""heavy-set"" and/or has a REALLY inflexible body, maybe they can't do any of these exercises (as modified), but I have to imagine that most people can do at least one or two of them (as modified).

Kathi Casey, who demonstrates the exercises, is not a super-model and the DVD, while ""adequate,"" is not some hi-tech production filmed on the shores of Hawaii. WHO CARES? The film quality is reasonable, the purpose behind the exercises is well explained, and the exercises are sufficiently demonstrated, with very good instructions. And if they work....well, they work. That is what is important to me.

I just got the DVD from Amazon and watched a couple of times, while doing the exercises. Frankly, my sciatic problem is caused by a herniated disc, so I am not sure how much it will be helped by stretching the piriformis muscle. For people whose sciatic problem is caused by a tight piriformis muscle (piriformis syndrome), this DVD would progbably be more helpful. I would guess that stretching the piriformis muscle, and other muscles the exercises relate to, would be helpful ""to some degree"" for anyone that has sciatica. (Another DVD that would probably be more helpful for bulging or herniated disc and sciatica [among other back problems] is ""Yoga Therapy for Back Pain"" with Emily Kligerman. Some of Kligerman's poses are similar to stretches given to me by my chiropractor & my osteopathic physician, just with more movement and less time ""holding"" the position.)",1297036800,52,2744,4.79492600422833
8236529,5,B00101JNGU,"I got this out of desperation, due to the constant pain on my buttocks and numbing, burning, shooting pain down my leg, heel and sole of my right leg, Sometimes the  pain would also go up my back, almost wrapping itself along my rib-cage.  I also got prime video--Tools for Sciatica Relief.
Before going to bed I decided to follow her and do the 3 stretches. As I was doing the last 2 stretches, which I had done before with other barre and yoga exercises, I noticed a release. I don't know if it's because she was walking me though them, emphasizing to be gentle and giving me different variations on being careful and not to overdo myself--we don't want to irritate that which is already irritated.
As I was doing the last 2 stretches, I began to feel a release on the front part of my gate/hips.
Last night was the first night I was able to sleep without that constant pain, that constant burning shooting all throughout my right leg and foot.
I had to write this review, even though it's only been one day. As she states, you have to do these 3 stretches for the rest of your life, they are just 3 stretches.  2 years I lived with this  pain, I can certainly continue to do these 3 stretches for the rest of my life. I will do them in the morning and at night.
I'm not flexible enough to do these stretches, but she does give you alternatives. I don't know why some people are giving her bad reviews when she gives you modified, or alternative stretches to do.
Stretches:
Pigeon stretch,
cross over leg stretch,
hamstring stretch.
I also did the figure four stretch, sitting on a chair and a butterfly stretch.
You can also go to: spine-heath dot com and click on sciatic piriformis. They also have about the same videos.",1510704000,5,1725,4.398119122257054
8236530,5,B00101JNGU,"I love this video! The poses are fairly easy to do (I have been doing yoga for several years now) but if you have never done yoga, she does show alternative poses to do to achieve the same results. I watched the video a couple of times and now I just do the 3 poses when I have a few minutes and don't even need to watch the video while I do them. After a few days of doing the poses my sciatica is feeling great!",1507852800,2,413,3.813953488372093
