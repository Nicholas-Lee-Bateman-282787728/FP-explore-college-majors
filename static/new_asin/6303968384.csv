I concur with the other reviews here, but this must be added:  The cinematography is outstanding.

764637,5,6303968384,Excellent film for anyone interested in Buddhism. There are so few dramatic films about Buddhism; most are documentaries about Buddha or Buddhism. This one teaches the principles through the story. Have watched it several times.,1384819200,,228,5.542857142857143
764638,2,6303968384,"Buddhism, particularly Zen Buddhism is a central part of my life.  Of course that does not make me a faultless judge of something which purports to be proselytizing one of the most compassionate religions of the world.  And I am sure many of the Buddhist followers/scholars will disagree with my opinion of this movie. Ultimately in things like art and religion, we each must form our own values and opinions, of course.
But in short, from my understanding of Zen Buddhist criteria, ""Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East"" is a very weak and incomplete visual sutra. One of the primary tenets of Buddhism, in all the vehicles, is compassion. And instead of illuminating compassion, this film focuses on alienation, abstruse narrative, emotional coldness and sometimes even cruelty.  Perhaps its purpose is to show that life is hard.  But if that is the case, where is the saving grace of true Buddhism demonstrated here?  The only dharmic moments come from the landscape.  If the film had had no humans in it, I believe it would have taught us more about love and beauty.  Even the statements of the aged monks in the film seem distanced, empty, confusing, and lacking warmth.  So, regretfully, I can't recommend it as a Buddhist film.
Not only this, but ignoring Buddhist matters, the film is in great need of some artistic and intelligent editing.  The Tricycle magazine review on the cover praises the movie as in the tradition of the Japanese filmmaker Ozu.  That is extremely far from the truth, if Ozu had done this film it would have lasted ca. 90 minutes, if that, not 145 minutes.  He believed in not prolonging a narrative sequence, but keeping it cryptically brief (he also believed in subtracting movie plot-line).  He would have never allowed such a mass of footage to remain in the film which does not contribute in some way.  Granted the lengthy parts which allow the gorgeous landscapes to soak in, could be contributive, but I feel the movie suffers from just being too long.
Instead I recommend with great enthusiasm the recent Japanese film by Takahashi Banmei, simply titled ""Zen"".  That film will move you closer to the heart of Zen and ironically to the heart of Christ.",1349395200,6,2193,4.8133333333333335

did enjoy it much more on 2nd viewing.

I do find it slow. Maybe because of my long interest in
Buddhism, many of the ideas are familiar enough to me that in some
cases it felt like simply an illustrated lesson on things I've read.

However, a other times, it makes some central Buddhist ideas really
come to life in a very meaningful, moving way.

It earned a few votes on Sight and Sounds '10 Greatest Films Ever Made'
list. A few noting that the film improves on repeat viewings, once the
expectation of plot, etc has been removed.

It's really more a meditation than a 'film' in the usual sense.

764641,3,6303968384,"if you can't sit still for 1 minute - this film probably isn't for you - it's a film composed mostly of disjointed scenes - each like a meditation - of 3 monks in the Korean mountains performing their activities - generally without dialog - absolutely without explanation

the little dialog there is - including a voice over - offers koanic advice - as well as advances 3 subtle plots - the old monk is ill and needs medicine - in fact - he's almost eager to die - the young adult monk is feeling guilty for abandoning his family in the ""world"" for this ascetic life - the adopted young boy is exploring the only life he knows

the transfer to this DVD seems to be high quality - the visuals are often strikingly beautiful - the sounds are either ambient or of exotic sounds or music

In any case this movie is well not too interesting. Contains some nice images.

When this newer version came out, I was hesitant to purchase it because, of course, I already owned a copy.  However I am glad I did.  The enhanced audio and visual quality of this release made the purchase worthwhile.  I even enjoy the added scenes that are not in the earlier version.

""I was thinking (first mistake!) of saying, ""Top Five."" Then I realized that this is more than even ""Top Three (or Two)"" of all the movies I have in my collection, or have ever viewed, for that matter.

I respect it and in many ways I try to practice it. I watched this film twice giving it my full attention.  I truly enjoyed the scenery and the overall artistic style was very nice.  I did watch it on a VHS tape so it was a bit grainy but that may have added to the charm.  The problem I have with this film is that it goes against my understanding/concept of Buddhism and Zen teachings.  The entire film was a depressing ordeal from beginning to end. I understand the intent and lessons of the film but I would rather see a Zen Master who treated his family with kindness and affection.  A boy lost in the woods and no one cares.  A group of people sitting around the fire in silence who do not recognize the existance of another human being. This is not a Master who I would respect or even enjoy being in his company.  A dying Master who smiled on his death bed and showed compassion is what I want to see.  Life and Death is a combination of emotions.  There should be SOME joy in both Living and Dying. Perhaps this Master needed more training... Then again maybe it will be better for him the next time around. If the intent of this movie is to show how unhappy people can be then it is a Winner. Looking at the other reviews for this film shows that I am in the minority... Guess I can live with that (LOL).

To those who disliked or didn't care for this movie, I'd like to quote film critic Roger Ebert, in that you should rate a movie for what it DID rather than what YOU thought it should've done. Korean Buddhism has helped Koreans weather their turbulent and sad history, and well, I'm sorry if you were disappointed that it wasn't a ""yipee, I'm so happy"" type of feel-good film.

It's a contemplative movie, much like the Iranian stuff Kiarostami has made popular. So what we need to look at first are the images and the atmosphere. Well, it's very dissapointing. There are sparks of beauty and raw emotion here and there, but most of the images are murky, badly framed, and sometimes a stereotypical ""city is bad, rural is good"" pap. The DVD itself is TV-quality, and this detracts greatly from the shots. I don't care where (South Korea) or how (with one handheld camera) it was filmed, if it looks crappy, it can't be a good contemplative movie, period.

764745,5,6303968384,"Those viewers wanting an entertaining evening at the movies may wish to stop reading this review now. Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? is not an entertainment in any traditional sense. The purpose of this film is to help us make connections with the world as it is.  As we patiently watch the screen we may be gently or not so gently startled by what we experience.  It may be that what we thought we knew we see truly for the first time.

Korean director Bae Yong-Kyun accomplishes this awakening in three ways.  First he presents a story of two monks and a young orphan boy.  The old Zen master, Hyegok, rescued the boy, Haejin from poverty in the city and brought the boy to a Zen mountain retreat to live.  The young novice monk, Kibong, leaves his blind mother in the city to seek enlightenment.  Kibong is directed by a Zen priest to go to the mountain retreat to assist the old master, who is dying.  The master instructs his student and the young boy with few words, the example of his own life, and an occasional sharp remonstrance.

One important lesson the master teaches is the illusion of self and the interconnectedness of all beings.  Suffering arises from the false desires of the self.  The novice suffers deeply because he is confused about the right action to take and the purpose of his life.  He feels guilt for having left his blind mother.  At one point the novice goes down the mountain to buy medicine for the master in the city.  He looks in on his mother without announcing himself and then quietly leaves her alone.  He has made the decision to care for his master, not his mother.

The orphan has his own story.  What little action takes place in this film centers on the activity of the boy.  First, he throws a rock and stuns a bird which falls in the water.  He quickly retrieves the bird and tries to nurse it back to health.  Next, he himself is almost drowned by a group of boys who continue to dunk him under water as a screams in his fear and anguish.  Soon after his encounter with the boys, he is standing on a rock face above the water and he is startled by the mate of the bird he wounded.  He falls from the rock into the water and almost drowns.  At the last moment he relaxes completely and begins to float.

The screech of the bird directs us to the second important element in the film.  Sound is carefully used to bring us back to attention from our slumbers.  This movie is so quiet and peaceful at times that we may be so relaxed we begin to doze off.  The scream of the boy in the water, the screech of the bird, the gong struck by the novice, even the opening frame of the film in which the noise of a train passing alerts us to pay attention to all that will follow.

The peace I mentioned directs us to the final ingredient to be discussed.  This film takes place in the beautiful mountains of Korea.  Wind and water, fire and air, forests and fields are all lovingly shown and tell their own story of change and interconnectedness.  For much of 137 minutes we watch from the mountain top the beauty of the world unfold before us.  The master directs the attention of his novice to the breathtaking beauty and reality of what is right there for him to experience.

After my first viewing of Bodhi-Dharma, I waited a couple of days and then picked a quiet time to watch the film again.  The elements I have mentioned in this review became more clear with the second viewing.  This is one of those films that repay study for those who want to understand director Bae Yong-Kyun's vision.  Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? is his only film and it was seven years or more in the making.  This film justly deserves the praise and attention it has received.

764748,2,6303968384,"As a Buddhist from a devout Buddhist family, I was delighted to find a film about the Mahayana.  I bought it and brought it to California with me on a recent trip when I visited my family, and even invited our teacher, a Vajrayana lama to watch with us.
I going to try to word my words respectfully.  Though I appreciate what the author has done and I fully applaud all efforts in Buddhist filmmaking, I was left disappointed with 'Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East.'
The movie is indeed shot beautifully, with gorgeous images and very poetic scenes.  However, imagery does not a movie make.
I can see the director's intentions, but some parts terribly misrepresent the path of cultivation.  For instance, the old monk's body is in its current damaged state because he meditated up against a block of ice in attempt to conquer sleep.  Not only is this not advisable and detrimental to health, but misrepresentative of the practice.  Buddha starved with the ascetics only to come to the conclusion that to put his body through so much suffering is extremist, and instead, we should opt for moderation and the middle way.  And why should we want to conquer sleep, anyway?  What's the point?  When Buddha walked the earth with us, even he had to bow to the physical limits of his nirmanakaya form and ate, slept, and cared for his body.
The Dharma should bring its followers peace of mind, fulfillment, contentment, and more and more happiness as we practice it more and more.  However, this movie portrays monks undergoing mental torment and anguish throughout the movie.  It seemed as if the movie piled more and more anguish on the monks as the movie progressed.  The only scene I saw where they were at ease and happy was when the old monk pulled a tooth from the boy monk with the help of his other disciple.  In my opinion, it should have been the other way around, with them growing freer and freer, happier and happier, more and more peaceful as the movie went on.
Zen is not abstract, it is actually a very straightforward practice, but I fear non-Buddhists who watch this and base all their opinions off it will take away the wrong message of not only Zen, but Buddhism in general.  The concept of Bodhicitta (vast, impartial love for all beings) that is the very heart of all Mahayana practice isn't even addressed (a slight reference is made to compassion).
I would consider a successful Buddhist film to be one that inspires its viewers to arouse bodhicitta themselves and, like the Buddha, go forth into the world bravely to alleviate the suffering of the world.  That was not the goal, however, with this film.  It instead focuses on Zen, but without portraying and emphasizing the bodhicitta (or growing, budding bodhicitta) of the monks and how they progress towards that goal using Zen as a means of practice, the concept of ""Zen"" itself becomes pretentious, useless, and hollow.  With this movie, it's as if the very heart of the practice- love, compassion, tolerance for all beings- was left out.  Zen is just a way of practice.  If Zen is the ship and wisdom the anchor, compassion is the wind that powers the sails.  To make a movie just about ""Zen"" without giving equal (if not more) emphasis to the other two- wisdom and compassion- is to have a boat lost and just sitting out at sea.  That's how I felt about the movie, that it had no sense of direction or point at the end.
That's how I feel about the movie, that it lacks heart.  If you're looking for a Buddhist movie with plenty of heart, I would suggest the movie ""The Cup"" over this one (it was nominated for 'Best Foreign Film' from Bhutan, but lost the Oscar to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon').  It's absolutely delightful and wonderfully represents active compassion in practice.

The film is not much a story telling but somewhat like a series of beautiful still photos. Anyone who loves films in a little bit serious manner not just for an ENTERTAINMENT must watch this film. Even if you don't have much interest in Eastern culture or Buddhism, you may be able to enjoy this film at least the fantastic visual images only if you have a little imagination on what the original colors were like.

I have studied Zen as well as several other different lineages of Buddhism for most of my life and found this movie to be a wonderful depiction of the philosophies of the East. Beautifully filmed. A must see for those who look for the positive in all they see! I will admit that this movie is not for everyone. With the films that most of us are used to this will appear to slow for many.

764824,5,6303968384,"As a young Korean immigrant, it's impossible to describe in words my feelings when I found this movie in USA. Even though so many wonderful films are made in Korea, they seldom get noticed world-wide. This is one of the ""wonderful films"" that are hard to find. I've watched this movie several times now, but frankly, there still are a lot of things that I don't understand. The reason I keep watching, though, whenever I have time, is because of pure aesthetics in words and images. In my opinion, you don't have to understand anything, nor should you be buddhist or have knowlege in buddhism to like this movie. Every words and images have beauty all by themselves and they make you feel something, and think something. Well, if not, at least they make you feel peaceful.  If you are a person like me, who's tired of car honking, crowded train, and this jungle of concrete buildings, I strongly suggest you grab this movie, and have a moment of serenity. The English subtitle looks very good, although there are some words that are just not translatable. But that's just my opinion, since I'm more accustomed to Korean than English. My last words -- if you decide to buy this movie, enjoy the scenery. Korean mountains are SO BEAUTIFUL!",974332800,14,1237,4.674311926605505
764825,5,6303968384,"There are not nearly enough Korean films available in the West, and this is the kind of movie which reminds me that we're missing out. A Buddhist monk and his apprentice live in a temple up in the mountains, and  contemplate life and all of its meanings. This is the basic premise for a  film which lasts for 2 hours. And it took 10 years to make. But this is no  criticism. Plenty of Zen Buddhist philosophy abounds despite sparse  dialogue. While the film has a very challenging duration to endure, people  who do stick with it will learn something of this popular religion (which I  for one find interesting), and will also be treated to a lot of simply  beautiful, captivating and breath-taking Korean natural scenery. If you  can't watch a film without action, or a dialogue-driven drama, then don't  torture yourself. This is not for you. Everyone else however will find a  damn good film with depth-aplenty.

However, once you touch even a small part of it, you will be surprised how natural and easy it is. In this movie  the director tries to simplify and symbolize Mahayana Buddhism for viewers.  Of course, it is not easy to understand for the first time. But, I am sure  that you will at least get the big frame of Mahayana Buddhism after  watching it again and again. If you hate this movie, please think about the  director. He spent about 7 years in the mountains in order to make this one  movie.

764829,5,6303968384,"When I was in Korea about ten years ago, I heard about this movie, but I have not seen this move until DVD is released recently.
This movie is not for everyone, because it is hard to understand Zen and other underlying  stories (also the cinematography). I am not a Buddhist, but I think I know  better than usual Western viewers. Keep in mind that my review is of  novice.
At first scene, you hear very loud warning sounds from traffic  signals and sounds of a train passing by. The sounds from wooden bells  carried by Buddhists have been used to open the closed minds of common  people (fools) by the strong wave energy penetrating into their inner  minds. You later hear sounds of the wooden bell by the monk in the market.  Also, you can hear various sounds from metallic bells and others in the  movie.
The Zen koan is also used to open the closed mind by sudden  striking force. You can not easily escape from old habits, stereotypes and  various beliefs which you have accumulated and learned after your birth. To  cut those connections which are usually obstacles to the Way to  enlightenment, you need some sudden and strong force. A sound or koan can  be used for this purpose.
'Karma' is a basic principle to make the story  in the movie. The boy killed a bird. He later suffered in water. The cow  symbolizes a kind of lucky guider when you are struggling to escape from  darkness. Due to any kind of guider, you can have a chance to move toward  the enlightenment or Nirvana, which is given because you have accomplished  somethings or have helped other lives during the past life.
The woman  wearing black Korean cloth is the boy's mother. She appeared in the dream  of the boy when he struggled to escape from a crisis. I could not interpret  who is the woman who danced when the old monk (master) was to pass  away.
There are other 'karma' stories overlapping each other, but I could  not interpret all of them. I believe I can understand most of stories,  after seeing the movie several times more.
What is the answer to the  title, ""Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?"". My primary  answer is that he left because he could not stay at the same place any  longer.",946252800,11,2185,4.477157360406092

Many messages acted out (rather than spoken), which is very ""koan""-like.  I too was frustrated and somewhat bored at points but realized that's part of the problem of the human mind.

The film doesn't have gross shocking scenes the way most movies do, therefore it's visual scenes can be appreciated, even when someone dies. The movies has subtitles for English, but there isn't much dialogue  therefore it isn't a struggle trying to view a movie while at the same time read the subtitles.
Maybe the disc I received was a bad oddity and if so I hope your last longer. Half way thru the film the disc starts to skip or get stuck for a few seconds with its signal and color becoming a problem, and this happened off and on throughout the rest of the film. So I trashed it, because when this happens to a disc, I haven't had any luck trying to fix it. Cleaning, etc.

7859602,5,6303968384,"Directed by a reclusive arts professor in Korea, who used his own resources in the film that took over seven years to make and did not use any professional actors, ""Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?"" is a philosophical film that seeks to understand the meaning of life through two Zen koans. 'Koan' is an the enigmatic phrase whose purpose is to tie our tongue so that we may reflect in silence and thus enter meditation. The koans that this film presents are: What is my original face before my mother and father were conceived? and; In death, where does the master of my being go? The film does not answer the koans. It rather invites the viewer to ponder on them as one watches an aging Zen master who is on the verge of dying; his apprentice who is questioning his faith; and an orphaned boy who has deliberately wounded a bird and is beginning to realize that all may not be well. As someone remarked, this film is not about zen, it is zen.",1416960000,,951,4.378531073446328
