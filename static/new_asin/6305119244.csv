7883936,4,6305119244,"It's a dumb movie but I love it.  I have been insanely mad for these madcap British comedies since I first saw them in high school. A great repertoire of British actors round out the cast..Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, and Hattie Jacques to mention a few.  The bad thing about this film is that it is a poor print and not transferred to cassette like its predecessor ""Carry On Nurse.""  It looks like it was filmed with a camera aimed at a television screen while the movie was on.  If you love the ""Carry On"" series it is probably worth the investment.  However, the quality of film is a major disappointment",999561600,4,607,4.4324324324324325
7883937,3,6305119244,"One of the early films in the series made at the end of the 1950's and shot in black and white. This is a simple comedy, reminiscent of the St. Trinians comedies that were around at the same time. The general plot is  of a headmaster who wishes to transfer schools only when a group of school  children overhear his plans they do everything they can to ensure he stays  on due to his popularity with the pupils. So follows several comic  misunderstandings and slapstick mayhem such as the staffs tea being laced  with alcohol, superglue on chairs, doors that fall down when  opened...predictable yes but good clean old fashioned stuff and is one of  the better early entries in the series. This stars most of the familiar  faces such as a very young looking Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Hattie  Jaques, Charles Hawtrey and Kenneth Connor. A good comedy on the whole with  a surprising touch of sentimentality at the end of the film. Calmer than a  lot of the later entries and it doesn't 100% feel like a Carry On but then  it could hardly be anything else!",961632000,4,1057,4.534391534391534
