885285,2,6304475357,"I just bought this one because it was on sale. I do not recommend it because it is VERY deorganized in all aspects of the video. There are many minutes without explanation, there is not a ""script"" or something. Sometimes you don't know what they are talking about, and I gopt sick of seeing all the times the same footage without comments nor explanation.
Don't waste your money. It is not worth it.

The production value is very high - everything from the narration, story-telling and the science behind each incident is very well done, as I would expect from the Smithsonian association.

It's definitely not for the faint of heart becuz some of these episodes don't have happy endings.  The crashes often involve either everyone onboard dying or most of them.  But there are also several stories, with close calls, where luck & quick thinking by the pilots saved everyone's lives.  Whatever the outcome, these episodes are always fascinating & entertaining to watch.  There are interviews done with the pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers & NTSB investigators. Decent actors are also used to re-create the drama that unfolded.  I also like that they not only show the american airlines but international ones as well & how they use CGI animations of the planes to show what went down. The most interesting part to me though is that they dive deep into why the accidents happened in the first place & also show what measures were taken to make sure they would never happen again.

This is my fav series on the Smithsonian channel & it is a great series to watch.  Even if you're a nervous flier like me.  LoL",1426118400,,1116,4.682051282051282

886219,5,6304475357,"I've put off writing a review of this series for months hoping to come up with something special to say about it.  I can't do the series justice, but that's my failing, not theirs.
  It is easily one of the best documentary series I've even seen and I've been watching them for 40 years now.  I like documentaries about engineering and science and this one is not only more technically-oriented, it's also very thorough.  It is not just the creators of the series that are thorough, but the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) and the other organizations around the world dedicated to discovering what causes airplane crashes that are to be thanked for all their work.
  They are never satisfied with a single answer, a simple cause for a disaster; they continue to ask questions until they understand what happened from all angles.  One example was the case of a DC-9 that landed on a highway in Georgia many years ago.  The immediate cause was flying through a thunderstorm, but they did more than recommend not flying through storms.  They also came up recommended improvements to the radars carried on airliners; changed policies at airports so that weather reports are better communicated to all aircraft in the area; modified procedures for flying through a storm (should it happen).  And more.
  All of the accidents covered that have been included in Seasons 1 through 4 enjoy the same thorough coverage.  And they always manage to explain things so that amateurs like me can understand them.  They interview experts and, in the case where there are survivors, crew and passengers; and make a very full report of what happened, before and after the accident.
  These episodes are both interesting to watch and, for me, a comfort in that I know someone is trying to make air travel as safe as possible.
  It's well worth watching and highly recommended.",1416009600,2,1868,4.8544303797468356

886366,1,6304475357,"This is typical garbage produced by the media.  The experts that appear in the show have unquestioned credentials in the aviation community, and do not make any false statements, so it makes me wonder who is making the final decisions as to what goes into the content of these programs.  I recently saw the ""Mixed Signals"" episode on the Smithsonian Channel, and I was appalled at the lack of knowledge displayed in the narrative about how an air data computer works to display airspeed.  Contrary to what the program says with authority, the airspeed errors induced by this pitot system blockage were NOT due to expanding air in the blocked pitot system.  They were due to NORMAL BEHAVIOR of the air data computer when pitot pressure does not change, but pressure in the STATIC SYSTEM does.  Contrary to what the program clearly states, the air data computer does not have only one connection to the outside world for airspeed information.  It does NOT only rely on the pitot system for indication, but also the static system.  The reason the flight crew saw an ever-increasing airspeed indication as they climbed was due to the fact that THEY WERE CLIMBING!  An air data computer will increase its airspeed indication if altitude increases and pitot pressure remains constant (such as would happen with a blockage).  I have to wonder how long it ACTUALLY took to pursue a theory in the investigation of the FDR and CVR tapes, as the conditions shown in both OBVIOUSLY indicated a pitot system failure.  Mud dawber wasps are a problem in MANY locations for packing aircraft instrumentation systems.  Also, autopilots have built-in safety features that cause them to disconnect when abnormal acceleration is encountered.  Did this program really chronicle investigators that were that incompetent, or were the actual facts altered to make for better entertainment?  I'd like to know how much these consultants and investigators get paid, because although I make a very good living as an avionics inspector of 20 years, I sure would like to make what these guys are making.",1384646400,,2072,4.971014492753623
886367,4,6304475357,"This is a documentary series produced by National Geographic and public broadcasting in Canada in 2007 that was picked up by the Smithsonian Channel.

Each episode is a documentary account of an air disaster, some of them famous and familiar, some of them more obscure, that goes through the findings of government authorities (often the U.S. National Traffic Safety Board, but some of the safety agencies of other nations) on the cause of a particular accident and actions taken or recommended in light of the investigation. Often, the safety investigation agency has only the ability to make ""recommendations"" for change, but cannot compel change. Generally, the program seems to deal fairly with these issues. Where ""recommendations"" are not subsequently compelled, the program usually provides a fair and balanced explanation of the countervailing view(s).

Some episodes use footage from other episodes involving similar accidents, which is fine if not overdone. There have been occasions when I've felt I'm viewing a ""clip show."" Similarly, pilots, or others with significant familiarity with aviation, may see where the program is going long before it gets there.

In one instance, a brand new jetliner suddenly loses both engines in perfect weather and has to make an emergency landing on an abandoned military air strip that has been converted to a drag strip. While I'm sure the investigators in fact looked at all of the possible causes the program details, any pilot would suspect a defective calculation in fuel load (conversion of volume in gallons to - in this case - weight in kilograms). That is exactly what happened. The knowledgeable viewer is frustrated: ""Why don't you check the fueling records?""

In another instance, pilots attempting to take off as soon as possible to avoid bad weather get lost, traffic control changes their runway at the last moment to one much shorter than the one they anticipated, the plane is - at best - fully loaded, if not overloaded, the pilots rush through the checklists, cleared for takeoff, the plane rotates, but doesn't fly. Yup. In their haste, they forgot to put the flaps down. The program, however, takes forever to get there.

In these instances, the program would have been better if it gave the obvious cause up-front. Viewers would still be interested in learning how thoroughly each accident, even the most obvious, is investigated. And, in most cases - even the two listed above - there were other factors that contributed to the accident.

I titled this review as I did because, while the producers sometimes go into detail about the technical matters of flight, the re-enactments include dialogue taken from the transcripts of the flight voice recorder, and some data from the flight data recorders is presented that would be baffling to the uninitiated. [This is particularly true of the dialogue from the flight voice recorders. The producers seem to assume that the viewers know what the pilots and controllers are talking about. Although I am not a pilot, I am fortunate enough (having flown on enough private jets and having friends who are pilots) to know what's going on and what all the acronyms and abbreviations mean; other viewers are not going to get as much out of the programs.

On the other hand, there is much to be learned from this series that has nothing to do with aviation. The accident investigations are so thorough that they teach a great deal about how ""mission critical"" tasks might be better accomplished in any organization. A management consultant could write a book based on what has been learned from aircraft accident investigations.

Finally, I have a few quibbles. Sometimes, whoever transcribed the flight voice transcript to dialogue didn't listen carefully and gets it wrong. You can't,""turn right to heading 8-2-0."" There is no such heading.

And, the episode on Korean Airlines flight 007 (the 747 shot down by the Soviets in 1983 for allegedly invading their airspace) was not well researched. The episode claims the plane was off course because it was traveling on a magnetic heading rather than on the intertial guidance system, and a graphic is presented that shows the plane on a constant, incorrect, course. There have been books written on that incident. The pilots may have been lost or confused, but that flight did not fly on a single progressive course. It deviated in various directions for quite awhile.

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, their records (as well as the flight voice and data recorders) became available. The episode includes interviews with the relevant Soviet personnel, including the pilot who shot the plane down. It may be that diplomacy trumped accuracy, but I was disappointed. [I was also disappointed that, in light of 9/11, the producers didn't question seriously the attitude of moral superiority of the U.S. at the time. How would we respond today if an airliner from a non-friendly (or even friendly) nation deviated significantly off-course and headed for Earle Naval Weapons Station in New Jersey? What are those F-16s doing up there these days?]

All-in-all, the program is enjoyable and worth the money.",1379462400,,5170,5.07773851590106

886484,4,6304475357,"The investigations into the disasters are well covered and like while it isn't quite as good as Air Crash Investigation or Seconds From Disaster, it is still a good series. The accident and the causes are well covered and lots of information about what happened and how they changed aviation we know today to be safer.

If you are worried about flying, don't watch these before a flight. If you are keen to know how aviation got to where it is today and enjoy flying then this is definitely worth a watch.",1359158400,5,505,4.489130434782608
886485,5,6304475357,"There are very few shows like ""Air Disasters"" on TV, which is why I really appreciate that the Smithsonian Channel chose to make this series.

I've always found the subject of plane crashes fascinating. What's nice about how the Smithsonian Channel covers each case is that they give very thorough explanation and analysis of not only how planes fly, but why they crash. I love the very detailed technical explanations of what exactly happens to an airplane to cause it to crash(each episode of the series is about a specific crash). It's fascinating from a technical and scientific standpoint.

I also like that the show doesn't forget to show us how human life is affected by each disaster. Each episode discusses the experiences of a few passengers or family members of passengers from each flight. The show also focuses on what the flight crew and pilots may have been thinking and feeling in the moments leading up to the disasters.

Each episode makes sure to also include the accident investigation findings as well as how aircraft may have been updated, or in some cases even discontinued, after investigations. The re-creations of the crashes (including the inside and outsides of the planes) are really realistic looking and make the viewer feel like they are seeing it happen first hand. The very high-tech simulations are interesting to watch.

A good show overall.",1357862400,,1377,4.973913043478261

886487,5,6304475357,"I really enjoyed this series.  Each episode brings something new.  The historical matter is important for prevention of future accident.  Some of these disasters involve human error.  Like the cockpit crew that were discussing their problem as if they were in their home living room and they forgot that they were flying a new plane.  This accident was very costly to Eastern Airlines.  The airline went down tool.

Great series.

886488,5,6304475357,"Great educational program, and...

I really like air disasters videos, its very educational, and weirdly gives you re-assuring mentality when flying.. Each disaster incident triggers a insanely detailed investigation that puts together all the missing pieces that contributed to loss of life. These are hard lessons, but all those poor souls that died is such horrific circumstances did not die in vain! Most high profile crashes that happened in the past do not happen again, so these videos will give you some assurance that air travel still is the safest means of travel! For the most part all crashes happen because of mechanical failures, lesser numbers for pilot errors, or combination of both! Currently there are more automation lessening pilot errors, and planes that are built from new composites making equipment more durable and lighter. Here are the staggering facts; each and every day there are approximately 85,000 to 90,000 flights a day!!!! Worldwide, there are 1000 airlines! These are staggering figures, but what is even most impressive that there are almost no accidents! Sure small planes, low profile flights never make it to news headline, many lets say are fender-benders, or close calls. Nothing is perfect, but that is very impressive considering the amount of flights each and everyday 24-7 365... Without a doubt all those poor souls are watching over us making sure this won't happen to us what happened to them!",1352419200,3,1443,5.166666666666667
886489,4,6304475357,This tape was somewhat bothersome but also intriging.  I was somewhat skeptic about the narrator telling you only 3 people died in a crash but upon looking at it.. you wonder how anyone survived. I'm giving this 4 stars because of the footage.  I don't mean to sound morbid but one thing about VHS is that you can rewind and watch again and again.  Also..it brought a smile to my face when it showed the true skill of a pilot..when in trouble.. made a safe landing :)  This is not a blood and gut VHS but if you want to see some incredble footage (I'm not going to say crash) espescially at airshows you will like this VHS,1129507200,,622,4.245762711864407
886490,4,6304475357,"A very good video concerning the clips, including military and air shows. I was pleased to see even the current prototypes like the F-22 and the Grippen, which all seemed to have some trouble.
Seeing as most air enthusiasts understand to some extent the causes of air accidents I was pleased to see the actuel errors and causes that make air accidents so terrifying.
I would suggest this video as it shows a great extent of current planes and also the price is very appealing.",999907200,3,476,4.6117647058823525

7872366,5,6304475357,"Enjoyed Air Disasters so much that I have seen most of the recordings, and will view the rest as they become available. I think the crashes due to pilot error are the most frightening, and many times could have been prevented. One airline thought it would be cool if the passengers could watch the take off on a huge screen. When the plane plummeted to the earth, the passengers witnessed their impending death. The screen was never used in airline after that incident.",1510444800,,469,4.662650602409639

7872368,4,6304475357,"This is a well made and balanced documentary. I'm taking off one star because of the soundtrack. Yes, these disasters are actually industrial accidents due to mechanical, training or human error and yes, investigation and learnings is necessary, but real people died! Why have sensational music or melancholy music accompany something factual? This is not a commercial movie.",1489190400,2,375,5.482758620689655

7872371,5,6304475357,For months I've been getting emails from Amazon to start watching movies on Amazon for 'free'. But as soon as I checked it out I found out only one show in a series was 'free' and I'd have to pay to see the rest. Amazon used a typical gimmick to try to trick me into paying for what their ads said were free. The same shows they were selling I could get FREE from other online sources. I'm so sick of dishonest corporations and the psychopaths who run them who try to rip off people. Some love this form of 'capitalism'. I'm too ethical and moral to fall for their corrupt tactics.,1482969600,3,581,4.196428571428571
