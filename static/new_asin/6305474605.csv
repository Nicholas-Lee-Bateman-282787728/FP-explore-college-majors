7889860,5,6305474605,"This adaptation is very close to the original book and provides an insight  into the 'Old Bailey' and the justice system.  The series was filmed on  location in the actual courts, and around the 'Lawyer's' haunts of inner  London.  The normally staid, conservative corridors of the members of the  bar are thrust into a world of fear and horror, death and revenge, when one  of their own is murdered in their chambers.  The repercussions reververate  further afield when the victim's daughter is also put into danger.  It  becomes a race against time to save her. Again, Roy Marsden portrays Alam  Dalgliesh with his renowned flair. He is an accomplished actor who can  portray an inner thought of Dalgliesh through a simple twitch of an  eyebrow!  The cast is excellent,and like Marsden, come from theatrical  backgrounds, giving superb, clear diction, acting excellence and  verisimilitude to the whole story.  Only the English can make such a great  mystery show seem so authentic.  The evil murderer, Gary Ashe, and the  bitchy, aloof Venetia Aldridge QC, the victim, are chillingly portrayed.  Like the book, this adaptation elegantly shows the philosophical themes of  the older P D James, as the story ends with a brilliant twist, that leaves  the viewer wondering if justice has been served at all - or at best, only  'A Certain Justice.'",962755200,29,1346,4.981900452488688
