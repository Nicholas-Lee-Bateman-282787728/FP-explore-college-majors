It's 30 mins of sheer pain :)  Normally when you hear people complain about Anime is becuase the acting or writing of the dub was bad.  This show was doomed from the start!  I'm not sure what the Japanese script writers were thinking but their final result was an EPIC FAIL!!!  But if taken with a grain of salt, this show is actually a fun spoof to watch.

Why 5 atars?  This show is getting pretty rare and worth having just for that.  It's a classic piece of 90's era Anime that goes to show just how far the industry has come (on both sides of the Pacific.)  So buy it, put it in your collection, and torture your guests with it at a late night party!",1285027200,,775,4.140939597315437
