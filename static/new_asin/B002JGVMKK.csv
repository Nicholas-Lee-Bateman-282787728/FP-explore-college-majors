8371423,3,B002JGVMKK,"I own all of the Globe Riders videos and have to say this was my least favorite. It's still a good movie and worth buying, but it lacked the ""awe factor"" from some of the other films. The best part of this film is its emphasis on trip & bike preparation. I'm still a loyal fan, and would recommend anyone purchase the film. I won't be giving my copy away anytime soon :)",1307577600,,370,4.082191780821918
