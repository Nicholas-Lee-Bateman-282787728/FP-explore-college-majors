If you ever wake up in a mental hospital, and sometime tells you that you were hysterical, and now you can't remember any of it, STRONGLY suggest they help you keep the memory loss..
This brave woman undergoes ten sessions of hypnosis.  Each session not-so subtly takes place on a floor in a ten story building with its own color.  (Corny, yes, but hypnotists will employ corny if it works)  When she eventually puts it together, Sweet Jesus!!!  I almost chastice the character:  did she think she was going remember a bad toothace or stubbing her toe .You don't need a big budget to portray horror.  I suspect this script is mulling around Hollywood.  We may see it again on the big screen.",1526169600,,851,4.727891156462585
7970214,1,B00006JDU2,"A woman is hypnotized to face her demons as she walks through her home. The film is filled with drugs, bad acting, and confusing scenes. This low budget film misses on all cylinders. Bad acting (Especially Chris Martin who smiles at the wrong times) bad film quality, lousy sound, terrible dialog, and shoot the script writer. The opening party showed promise, but once we got by the crazy conversations the film became unwatchable.

Worth a punch on the your hacker's card if you can make it all the way through the film without using the FF button.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1388707200,2,594,4.701923076923077
7970215,4,B00006JDU2,"I really like a good story and this movie delivers.  Director John Specht (ABSOLUTION) guided the story through an exciting array of locations and imagery.  I was impressed by the lead performances of Robin Garrels and Chris Grega in this movie.  This is an excellent low-budget feature that is interesting to watch over and over to catch different nuances of the main character as she is caught in the chaos of her own mind.  I enjoyed the horrific imagery, but was much more impressed with the psychosis of the characters and the relationships portrayed.  Pick this one up!",1121212800,3,575,4.826530612244898
7970216,1,B00006JDU2,"Was this even a movie that I watched? There is absolutely no gore, no script to think of, and no acting ability documented on this 82 minutes waste of my life. The film is extremely low-budget, and the only reason that they couldn't get an MPAA rating is that the filmmakers probably couldn't afford a stamp anyway.

The plot has something to do with getting $2000, drugs, amnesia, drugs, and more drugs. I think there might have even been a scene where drugs were not the major plot-point, but I can't even recall a scene with a plot at all for that matter. A big bowl of dumb that camp fans can't even laugh at, you'll just feel sorry for these guys.",1112918400,,652,4.344262295081967
7970217,5,B00006JDU2,"I was very impressed with this title!  I've seen many micro-budgeted features, but rarely have I've seen one as thoughtfully written as this one was.  On top of that, the movie features some strong performances (especially from Chris Grega and screenwriter Robin Garrels), tight editing and some excellent music.  If you're looking for Hollywood production values, look elsewhere cuz' this flick ain't for you.  If you have an open mind, you may find a lot to admire about this flick.  To check out a recent display of Garrel's talent, but sure to check out CHINA WHITE SERPENTINE, which she co-directed with Eric Stanze (SCRAPBOOK, ICE FROM THE SUN).  Good stuff!!!",1092009600,3,666,5.009090909090909
7970218,1,B00006JDU2,"The premise for this one is halfway interesting, but the actual product is boring, blundering, confusing, loop hole-filled, and very dry--as in not much blood.  Sub Rosa labels this one as ""Extreme"" as if it were actually living up to some standard when in reality it is much the opposite.
I can get past bad acting and how slow most horror movies pace themseleves, but when it adds up to nothing it makes me very mad.  Don't you dare buy this.  Shatter Dead is one of Sub Rosa's better pics, but other than that, I haven't seen much that impresses me by this company.",1054166400,2,568,4.4423076923076925
