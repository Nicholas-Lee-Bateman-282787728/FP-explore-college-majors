When I got a chance to watch this documentary, I was amazed how Mr. Worth has brought the Eastern philosophy to the Western World.

This is a MUST watch for all.

I saw the most recent version in Youtube. Here is the link to it:

Please pass it around. This is the best Masterpiece so far.

In this documentary, Ravi talks about his music up to that point, questioning the sudden popularity he gained after George Harrison mentioned him in interviews.  He comments that he never expected the kind of response he does get when he travels around the world, but wonders how long it will last.  He also wonders if the music listeners truly understand, or are they listening to it as a trend or fad.  He is humble enough to question his own importance, but says he would do anything to share his music and his culture with the rest of the world.  When he got the opportunity, he jumped at the chance.
Ravi himself speaks through voice-overs, laid over footage of him meeting people, performing, or even at a recording session.  One of the highlights happens in the beginning, when he is traveling by train back home to meet his guru, the legendary Ustad Allaudin Khan.  He said he hasn't seen his guru in years (""he must be fast approaching 100"") and is very afraid of what would happen.  But as soon as Khan is seen, Shankar bows to his feet and then hugs him.  When they are inside, Ravi comments on his his devotion to his guru was often more important than that with God, bordering on a fanatical state.  Here's a man who gave up seven years of his life to master the sitar, and now they are singing together like father and son, or teacher and student.
Other highlights include seeing him conduct a recording session with an Indian orchestra, teaching classes in India and California, and also talking about what made him want to play music in the first place.  He basically says music was always in the air, it was impossible to avoid.
It's been 32 years since the release of this film, and there definitely needs to be a proper follow-up.  ""Raga"" is a document of his music and its importance.  While there are a few so-called psychedelic scenes in here, this is not a psychedelic film.  Director Howard Worth did an excellent job in showing Ravi Shankar as a genuine musician, not as a guy who hippies wanted to worship.  If Mystic Fire plans to release this as a DVD, I hope they can digitally remaster this properly, and perhaps include some full performances, maybe even commentary from Ravi himself (and some perspectives from his daughter, Anoushka).
The VHS tape is taken from the best print of the movie they could find, and is definitely worth a purchase.",1007596800,7,2577,4.571739130434783
7850248,5,6303504124,"This video is a documentary about Ravi Shankar done in the late 60's. We see him perform with various musicians, teach  (George Harrison for ex.) and follow him to India where he meets his old teacher, and we hear his  comments on the 60's interest in all things Indian. This is a great video  not only for those interested in Indian music and culture but also for  those who are interested in the late 60's. (The video even has a typical  psychedelic part).
I've been a fan of Ravi Shankar for many years so this  video was heaven sent, it is great to be able to see  the master playing  and to hear his thougt on Indian music and culture.
I also highly  recomend his book, ""My music my life"" and of course all his great  recordings, Ravi is without a doubt one of the great musicians of this  century, regardless of style, and I am looking forward to reading his new  biograpy Raga Mala.",937699200,17,889,4.321212121212121
