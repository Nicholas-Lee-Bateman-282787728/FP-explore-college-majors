Had to add it to my collection. Heard that Robert Englund is going to do one more Freddy movie too. Can't wait to see it if it actually gets produced and not just some rumor I heard.",1486425600,,331,4.107692307692307

8725922,4,B012BYDK4K,"And here we find ourselves with yet another series of re-releases of the Friday the 13th franchise.

There are no versions of the feature films. There are no new special features. The contents of these discs is exactly identical to those that were included in the 2013 blu-ray box set that collected the Paramount franchise up to and including Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 remake. For those of you who own that now OOP set, there's nothing new to gain from buying these two disc sets.

The practical upshot of these is that if you don't own the complete set, you can pick and choose which films you'd rather have in relative comfort, and it also saves you the grief of the horrifying packaging that was inflicted upon the 2013 complete series box set (discs were damaged by the cardboard sleeve casing, as well as ill-placed dollops of packaging glue). Just be warned that your order may take some time to ship: I pre-ordered the Part V/Part VI set here at Amazon -- those are my favorite films in the series -- and it has yet to ship and is listed as temporarily out of stock. This in spite of my having placed the pre-oder back in July. It seems the sets are selling relative well, then.

If you haven't picked up the complete series box set, you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up all of the Blu-ray Double Feature Sets. They sell at a great price and you get all the content on the full set.",1441670400,,1403,4.347328244274809
