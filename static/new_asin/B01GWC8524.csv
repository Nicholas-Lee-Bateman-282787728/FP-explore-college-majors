7769106,5,B01GWC8524,"Shop around and you will see this set generally sells for around $32. Any one of the movies easily sells for $9.99. The movies themselves are all great. ""Home Alone"" most people are familiar with Macauley Caulkin causing havoc on burglars. In ""Jingle All the Way"", Arnold Schwarzenegger goes nuts trying to buy a kid a hot new toy. George C. Scott is excellent as Ebenezer Scrooge in another version of ""A Christmas Carol"". The remake of ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is good as well. I had two of these but for this price I bought the set so I could get the other two and then give two away or donate two to a good cause.",1197936000,7,617,4.282051282051282
7769107,3,B01GWC8524,"""Runaway Jury"" does justice to John Grisham's best-selling novel and they did a good job with casting, directing and acting.  Good quality DVD.  This is the best movie of the four in Legal Legends Collection Box Set.  I would rate ""Runaway Jury"" ***** and next time would only purchase ""Runaway Jury"".

""The Verdict"" I didn't finish viewing the movie, I would rate it * because of Paul Newman's overacting--it became tedious watching him ""drunk""--I have resold this DVD.

""Class Action"" I would rate ****; Gene Hackman is excellent and it was an interesting movie although there were few surprises in the plot.

""Compulsion"" I have not had a chance to view yet--will rate in the future.",1173312000,2,686,4.870689655172414
7769108,4,B01GWC8524,"This is a great bargain. Don't get me wrong! I would buy this again if it got lost. Can't beat the price for 4 good Christmas flicks.

Although I do wish they had included a newer edition of HOME ALONE in here. This one is the older letterboxed edition that is not enhanced for widescreen TVs. If your DVD player/TV/projector has the picture zoom option like mine, you can escape the problem with the black frame all around the picture on a widescreen TV, but the resolution/picture quality is still poor, of course.

JINGLE ALL THE WAY was the same thing, despite the deceptive cover which stated that the movie on the DVD was included in both Full Frame and Anamorphic Widescreen versions. Not so! The same crippled leterboxed frame.

No complaints about either the MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, which is presented here in beautiful Anamorphic Widescreen, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL, which, as a made for TV movie, is presented in Full Frame, maintaining the original aspect ratio.

All in all, a great deal for the money.",1169510400,31,1012,4.700564971751413
7769109,5,B01GWC8524,"I bought this box set for my friend's children as a Christmas present.  I really just wanted to send ""Home Alone,"" but it came with all the other films too, which was a bonus.

My friend and her family moved from California to Massachussets last year.  The kids (age 4 and 6) were very entertained when they saw Governor Arnold acting in the Christmas movie ""Jingle All the Way.""  It was a big hit and reminded them of home in California. Plus it entertained the parents too.  An unexpected bonus, and a great story to tell, don't you think?

""Home Alone"" reminded them of their visit to see us in Chicago a year and a half ago.  That was my intent in sending that movie to them.

""Miracle on 34th Street"" reminded them of when we all went to New York City last spring when we went to visit their Massachussets home.

Although my review is unusual to say the least, it was a very meaningful Christmas present to the kids since the box set highlighted all of the places we have visited together over the past year.  I am sure that is not what you intended when you put the set together, but it was a really great gift.  Thank you!",1168473600,,1129,4.278301886792453
7769110,4,B01GWC8524,Fabulous value! The home alone movie was a great movie to be included in this box set along with the classics!,1168300800,,110,4.285714285714286
7769111,4,B01GWC8524,"This set is a real sleeper that can fit into every home. The iconic fame of ""Home Alone"" among kids is no secret, but at least one  other movie makes the set worth buying. ""Miracle on 34th Street"", the only remake IMHO ever done better than the original, is a beautiful tapestry of uplifting story, touching script, great cast, and magnificent cinematography. It's my favorite contemporary Christmas movie. ""Christmas Carol"" with George C. Scott was well made, but it's hard to supplant the sentimental older favorites with Reginald Owen and Allistair Sim. ""Jingle All the Way"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger had a great message, but seemed to lack holiday atmosphere. Not bad, though, as a filler item. Overall, a set well worth the money.",1168300800,,736,4.983739837398374
