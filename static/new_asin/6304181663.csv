7868405,5,6304181663,One of my all time favorite movies.  I really wish I could find it on DVD.,1491868800,,74,3.625
7868406,4,6304181663,"Thanks to the supplier for actually HAVING a copy of this film. It's hard to find. The product was clean and looked nearly new. More than I ever expected and I'm happy with my purchase. This film is not the best movie ever made, but it has its place, showing us how we are losing our human connection through technology. They communicate through phone calls and never quite make a connection. A funny look at how are ways of communication were changing: we need an updated remake.",1362182400,,480,4.528735632183908
7868407,5,6304181663,This movie is a precurser to texting.  It shows what has actually become of us now that we depend on computers and phones for contact.,1328054400,,134,4.36
7868408,5,6304181663,"This is a smart, funny, creative and original film. This is a fresh comedy about 6 young New Yorkers who ""live"" on the phone. These phone-a-holics fall in love, break up, psychoanalyze each other, give birth and even die without getting off the phone. With an enjoyable score and very well written, this film is fun, marvelous and sophisticated. Released in 1995 it stars Caroleen Feeney, Tim Daly, Dana Wheeler Nicholson, Aida Turturro, Liev Schreiber, Alanna Ubach and Dan Gunther.",1106870400,,483,5.05
7868409,4,6304181663,"This movie is funny and a little sad.  We are fast becoming ""disconnected"" physically from the human race.  We communicate via phones, emails, faxes, etc.  Why even go out to the movies when you know it will be on cable in 3-5 months.  We order in food, shop on-line and talk on the phone in text messaging and can speak to an advice nurse on the phone.  This movie hits it on head!  Funny, funny, funny.  Frankly, I'm with Jerry (Liev Schreiber).  I could live in p.j.'s and never have a need to leave the house.  I may look into homeschooling the kids so I don't have to drive them to school and work from home.  Starting to really like this idea!",1034726400,2,649,4.245901639344262
7868410,4,6304181663,"Never judge a book by it's cover-that's what you learn from watching this trendy little grinfest.  Although it's quite brief and it's got a cast of unknowns-it succeeds.  In my opinion, a movie is a winner if it delivers effects that it's genre promises.  For example, a horror movie is good if it scares you-a drama is good if it makes you cry or at least grabs your full attention.  This parody of human communications IS funny, and it has the power to KEEP you staying in tune with the storyline.  So many things happen in the characters' lives and we learn this by listening to dozens of brief phone conversations.  With it's amusing subplots and charismatic characters, you will like this film.",1004486400,3,699,4.642276422764228
7868411,3,6304181663,"I recently caught this movie on cable, and I thought that it was okay.  It deals with a bunch of busy thirty-something-year-old New Yorkers, who are  friends, who can never find the time to get together.  As a result, they  mainly communicate by talking on the phone.  This movie blends romance with  comedy; during its course, one of the characters tries setting up one  friend with another friend, and another character is contacted by a  pregnant woman whom he artificially inseminated.  I found some of the  scenes to be funny, but I thought that the rest of the movie was sort of  dry.",966988800,2,590,4.631067961165049
