385110,4,6301933532,"I caught this movie on SciFi, and it wasn't as good as it looked from the advertisements, but it was better than what I thought it would be. I have a hard time understanding why some people say Kate Capshaw is a bad actress. She seemed good to me! I saw the TV version, and so the bed scen in some guy's dream seemed cut off, but still... it *was* funny. Or at least I could tell it had the potential to be funny. Unfortuantely, the resident geezer made me turn the TV off because there was a six year old, a five year old, a four year old, and a two year old in my TV room. I am currently searching for it so I can see the entire thing and not miss the gory and ""suggestive"" parts.",994377600,3,682,3.9136690647482015
385111,5,6301933532,"Forget about ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" by Nicholas Roeg. The TV movie ""V"" is good, but it must be pushed aside to this studio production. This is one of the most original and exciting science fiction movies to come along in a long time. It is intriguing, surreal, and imaginative without being off-putting or overlong. It has everything, right down to the romantic sub-plot. Still questionably underrated, this brilliant film about the process of 'dreamlinking' and helping people get over their nightmares is a very interesting idea. Performances are good and the special effects amazing. Everything I expected it to be and more.",989020800,6,632,5.0285714285714285
385112,5,6301933532,"If you love scince fiction with a good helping of what could be really possable in life, you will love this film. It's well filmed, well acted, and most of all a brilliant all round sci-fi adventure film into the unknow world of dreams, and nightmares... definatly a 10/10 score, more like this please!",974246400,2,302,4.611111111111111
385113,5,6301933532,"""Dreamscape"" is one of those often overlooked cinematic gems, which came on the vanguard of the mid-80's resurgence of lower budget SF which included  ""Real Genius"" and ""Wierd Science"", among others.

  Here we have Dennis Quaid exercising every charsima cell possible as a  washed-up psychic, who is enlisted by former mentor Max Von Sydow into a  top secret program to enter and control people's dreams.  Overseeing the  project is shady government spook played by Christopher Plummer, with plans of  permanently correcting US President Eddie Albert's apocolyptic nightmares.  Of course, some of the more fantastical SFX that seemed cool in theatres in  1984 show their matte lines now on video,  but the movie does harbour some  truly impressive tricks and unsettling dream sequences.  The story itself  is compelling, and the fine cast helps matters along by selling it  brilliantly, and it is a complete treat to see old scenery chewers Von  Sydow and Plummer acting against each other.  Another fine performance  comes from perennial 80's sleazebag David Patrick Kelly as Plummer's dream  assassin, but a weak link is Kate Capshaw's typically wooden performance as  Von Sydow's assistant.

 For some reason, I had a hard time hunting down  this film, eventually settling for a well-worn rental at the local Mom  & Pop videostore.  But this entertaining SF yarn is well worth the  search, if you can find it possible to see through the shamelessly obvious  Raiders rip-off box cover design.  Interestingly, Capshaw herself would end  up appearing in the second Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, and eventually  become Mrs. Steven Spielberg.  Good thing too, because she really wouldn't  have lasted long as an actress with her painfully stilted acting presence.  But don't lose any sleep over that, ""Dreamscape"" has enough  charm, momentum and surprise to overcome even the worst acting nightmare.",965952000,3,1899,5.216666666666667
385114,1,6301933532,"The film has always been one of my favorites, but this new DVD version has edited out some of my favorite most memorable scenes!
I really wish I had know this before I picked myself up a copy of this title!  I'd have rather  rented it just to see it again than own this terribly edited version of the  film.  Heck, you could tape it off of television and get this print of the  film.
I hope that some other company will release the real version of  this film one day, as it stands, I really wish I could return this poor  excuse for a release.  I would love to complain to Image Entertainment  about this release but after searchin all over the place, cannot find a  single email address or phone number on their site!  If anyone has any  contact information for this purpose please contact me.
The film in  itself is one of my all-time favorites, the humor and horror, along with  it's sci-fi elements I've always loved in this film.  Back in the day when  this was released along with the film Nightmare On Elm Street, the invading  people's dreams was a pretty new topic in film.  Now it may have been  overdone since, but this is a gem.  It's just too bad that this cut ruined  one of my favorite funny scenes, and even lowered to blood content.",963792000,20,1249,4.297413793103448
385115,3,6301933532,"I adore this movie for various reasons; the good script, lots of memorable scenes, and a great cast including the very inviting Capshaw and the very underused Kelly. To me it's not so much the movie's special effects, but  the genius story that involves you and make you want to watch it from time  to time. -Especially now that it's been letterboxed. However, as good  looking as this DVD is, there are a couple of ridiculous cuts. -The kid  cutting off the snakeman's head, now with less blood spurting than before.  -This cut is rather pointless since there wasn't that much red stuff seen  to begin with, and certainly not more than people are used to today. Even  worse though, are the changes made to the Homer Simpson guy's dream  sequence. -What was before a very amusing bedroom scene, now is shortened  to an unfunny mess leaving those who know it uncut perplexed. It really  makes no sense to cut this film, when it wasn't before. Who are they trying  to protect ?. Just because it's out on DVD, doesn't necessarily mean it's  now suddenly more available to folks with small children, does it ?.  They've jammed the disc with lots of extra goodies, like a commentary  track, but why go to that extent and still cut it ?. Did they plan it for  the family market, or what ?. We, the true fans of the movie are left  feeling somewhat cheated, and so in the end nobody really wins.",962323200,63,1388,4.492
385116,3,6301933532,"I saw this film years ago on TV and loved it.  In fact I've still got an ancient video version that I taped over 10 years ago.
It was great to see it again in widescreen and with DVD quality and it was as good as I  remember - except for the cuts.
In the UK we get films cut all the time,  a little at the cinemas and often more on VHS.  So imagine my shock to  discover a Region 1 DVD with more cuts than the UK television version of  over 10 years OK.  In the version I originally saw the nudity in some  scenes was limited, mild and ""in context"" in my opinion.  So I am  amazed it was cut from this DVD release.
However - I'd still say this DVD  is still well worth owning if you like this film.  The picture is great and  the sound is even better.",961891200,9,751,3.7987012987012987

385118,1,6301933532,"I love this movie.  It was one of the first PG-13 flicks to come out, so when I was a kid this was quite exciting.  It had some action, some nudity and a snake-monster all rolled into a fun pseudo sci-fi package.
Imagine  my disgust and horror upon discovering that the DVD of the film had been  edited for content!  Don't believe me?  Compare it to the video or laser  version.  The comical sex dream scene at the beginning has been altered so  that there are no breasts.  There are also no children watching.  This may  not seem all that important to you, but I think that this silent trimming  is quite insidious.  The film is rated PG-13 after all, which means that  parents should be cautious about showing it to younger kids.  Why then must  it be cut without telling us so on the package?
To sum it up, I love the  movie, but I hate this version.  Hooray for Hollywood.",960336000,208,876,4.296296296296297
385119,5,6301933532,"This movie is kind of obscure to most but it's still an exceptional film.  Dennis Quaid was pre-Inner Space, pre-Dragonheart and was sort of on the threshold of being one of the more fun and interesting actors of our time.  This was also an overshadowed film by the mega horror spectacle ""A  Nightmare on Elm Street"" but it's still great fun to enjoy.  Very  imaginative and different.  The dream sequences were phenominal for the  time when this film came out.  Sort of an Indiana Jones meets Jacobs  Ladder.  With the exception of a weak ending and geeky special effects it's  a great story and one that should be a addition to any collection.  Enjoy!",958867200,4,653,4.631578947368421
385230,3,6301933532,"While it was great to see this again in HD after so many years, I echo the other reviewers that I was disappointed in its apparent editing for content (the artificial zoom to hide the nudity in the 'cheating wife' dream).  Beyond that, I was also let down that this has NO SUBTITLES/CC - come on, that's a huge no-no in this day and age - especially with older movies with sound that goes up and down a lot (I found I had to ride the volume button a lot).  Good movie, fantastic to see several of my favorite actors in their younger years (Kate Capshaw obviously is HOT, but it was cool to see David Patrick Kelly as well in his sinister part).  But definitely this release could have been so much better.",1498262400,,705,4.246268656716418

385235,4,6301933532,"I loved this movie when it was released in the 1980""s but over the years it became very dated and the visual effects just looked terrible. VHS and then DVD versions didn't help and then large format tv's showed up and 1080 resolution. I never imagined that this movie could be pulled into the modern era without spending an enormous amount of money on a brand new restored and remastered edition. Scream Factory arrives on the scene and does a remarkable job. I only have a 1080 tv so perhaps that is why this movie worked for me. The movie is still solid and looks very good, if not excellent. There are still issues dealing with the compositing of images, but you can't change the source materials unless you are George Lucas. The story and characters still stand up and the acting is much better than I remembered. In all the new version is very good, but I still would like to see the deleted scenes that I've read about for years and still never seen. Maybe next time.",1488931200,3,973,4.441340782122905

385300,4,6301933532,"The movie looks great on Blu Ray and is as fun as ever but it needs to be said that this Shout Factory release is still not the uncut version.  Not sure of the whole legend of why some versions of this film have nudity and some do not but this is a ""does not"" version.  I don't believe it is simply a matter of the way it was cropped when it appeared on television in the 1980s--the dream scene on this Blu Ray where the cheating wife is briefly seen topless looks to me like it is artificially zoomed in on her to remove the toplessness (and yes, it is weird to be writing about this in such detail).  Whether that was the initial intent or not I couldn't say (maybe there's some sort of legal issue at play involving nudity clauses?  Who knows?)  That being said, this is probably as good a release as we can expect to see for this film and if you can get past a couple of fleeting seconds of nudity being missing you will still have a fun time with this flick.",1482451200,13,963,4.074074074074074

385404,4,6301933532,"This DVD version looks very good on a widescreen LCD panel in 16x9 format. There's minimal dirt and specks, along with the predictable grain that you might expect though far less of it than you'd expect. Sound quality is good also, with very few exceptions of channel drop-out (that's what it sounded like to me).

The biggest draw for this movie is the stellar cast; the biggest drawback is the stop-motion snake man. Director/co-writer Joseph Ruben decided to move the story away from sci-fi/horror and more towards espionage in the style of a Hitchcock thriller such as The 39 Steps or North By Northwest. The decision paid off handsomely with fewer scares but lots more suspense. Suspense has more re-play value.

Two things I still don't get are the motor-bike chase scene and Maurice Jarre's music. The bike chase scene always seems comic and anti-climactic. All I can figure is that Ruben was trying to be different and (alas) it didn't quite work. Jarre's sinuous love music for saxophone is dreamy and delicious, but the weird electronic sounds behind it distract me every time. It sounds like he didn't know much about synthesizers and may have been learning on the job.

As well as I can recall, this movie received high praise from Pauline Kael in The New Yorker when the movie first came out. The movie retains most of its original appeal, so as usual Kael was right.",1451779200,,1380,4.7656903765690375

385449,5,6301933532,"Fantastic movie!!!  I've been keeping a dream journal for ten years and belong to the California-based Earthboppin Dreams/Visions/Prophecy internet message board where I post some of my prophetic and other noteworthy nocturnal adventures.  This movie was released in 1984 when I was in college, but I only discovered it recently.  A Washington, D.C.-based ""think tank"" (probably affiliated with the U.S. government) tried to recruit me and other members of the internet dream board a few years ago, so the movie actually rang true in regard to the government intelligence agents who infiltrated the California-based dream-research lab.  This also harkens to the ""former"" psy-ops program at the California-based Stanford Research Institute (SRI) where the CIA recruited ace psychic-telepath/remote viewer Ingo Swan (now ""passed"").  On a current note, the film's plot involves the president of the United States who's been having recurring nightmares of a nuclear holocaust.  The president (played by Eddie Albert) wants to facilitate peace by getting rid of the nukes, but a dark psychopathic element within the U.S. government intelligence apparatus would rather assassinate the president than let him bring peace (ala JFK & Secy. Dulles).  Currently, the Obama Administration and Russia's government under Vladimir Putin are escalating tensions in war-torn Syria with U.S. and Russian fighter jets flying awfully close for comfort.  World War I began  with an isolated incident that quickly escalated and got out of hand.  To quote Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind"":  ""How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?""",1445817600,,1645,5.462450592885376

385593,5,6301933532,"Very cool 80's action adventure sci fi flick based on a 1960's sci fi novel where Dennis Quaid is selected for secret dream tests in a college science lab funded by a shadowy secret government organization run by the sinister Christopher Plummer (Star Trek & other various films).

 I remember seeing this film when I was a young boy in the theaters, and after many years later I had watched it online again trying refreshen my memory of the movie.  The biggest element I remember had been the ""Snake Man"" creature who haunts this little boy and Denis Quaid.

 Kate Capshaw (Indiana Jones & various other movies + wife of Steven Spielberg) plays a dream and brain doctor who is sort of a sexual love interest for Quaid as they try to survive an evil ""nightmare"" conspiracy involving Plummer and his evil intentions to use Quaid's psychic abilities for nerfarious purposes including complete control over the US Government.

 Even Norm from ""Cheers"" has a cameo role in this picture to really drive home the 80's theme.

 At one point Quaid, the woman, the young boy, and the President of the United States (this movie's loose interpretation of Ronald Reagan) team up in the dreamworld to stop the ""Snake Man"" and the other plotters.

 What I liked about the film was the cool ""nightmare"" inspired artistic imagery, the long maze like steps into an abyss, the ""funhouse"" like theme of the film where the heroes have to escape from this ""Snake Man"" guy & his true identity, then ultimately confront him in battle with in this ghoulish maze called the ""Dreamworld"".

 The film looks like a dream, with at the time fair special effects and weird imagery like this train traveling into what looks like ""Hell"" or another dimension.

 Actor Max Von Sydow is also a scientist featured in the film, and it was cool to hear he will play the next major villain in the new ""Star Wars"" films coming out.  Good film if you like both horror, sci fi, and action adventure movies like I do.

 This version of the film may be cut to the ""PG-13"" release because the original director's version features swear words, violence, and some nudity, so try to find the non-PG version if you can online here.",1422921600,,2181,4.650130548302872

385846,4,6301933532,"Hmmm, getting into another person's dream to manipulate them. Interesting concept...though a little far fetched. BUT it does make for some interesting situations in this film. You've never seen Dennis Quade quite like this in his other movies. At the time of its release in 1984, it was very much the new state of the art for science fiction and horror...getting into another persons head, specifically their dreams. Talk about your privacy issues! The cast, in addition to Quade, includes Kate Capshaw, Christopher Plummer and Max von Sydow, and Eddie Albert (the guy from Green Acres) as the president of the United States. These are some heavy weight actors and it supports the idea that this was a really strong effort at making a quality film. It is rated highly by Rotten Tomatoes and other individuals who have seen the film. It is the old battle of evil verses good. And if you have ever had a bad dream or even what is technically called a night terror (the ones that make you sweat and scream) then this film may unleash a few of your own evil dream spookys! Rather scientific and psychological in its approach, there is an attempt made on the president's life in order to overthrow the government by the military-industrial complex......sound familiar? I have tried what is called ""lucid dreaming"" for a college class that I have taught. Lucid dreaming simply means you are so aware that you are dreaming that you can actually manipulate the content of your dream. Not sure if it works but in this film it not only works, but works in another person's dreams! Somewhat dated in its special effects but a real keeper and worth the price and viewing time.

Of course you can't compare the graphics or special effects, in fact, the effects in Dreamscape are laughable by today's standards, but this was really the first movie to explore entering someones dreams. The story is wonderfully creative with unlimited possibilities, but at the time it was made, you couldn't rely on the special effects to make the movie, the way some films today do. What Dreamscape really needed was a young charismatic star to put the film over the top, and they found him in Dennis Quaid. The difference in his personality and the types of roles he chooses to take have done a complete turnaround over the last thirty years. The Dennis Quaid of today is a strong, emotionless character, who is determined to do whatever he sets his mind to. In Dreamscape he's funny, ambitious, and absolutely adds character to a story that could have gone either way. What the film loses in predictability and the sometimes slow pace, is more than made up for with Quaid's standout performance. I'd always heard good things about Dreamscape and how it was the inspiration for Inception, but it's a thirty year old film with outdated effects and some really cheesy stuff, I really didn't expect it to be as good it as it was.",1361491200,,1296,4.68859649122807

The Upanishads show that dreaming is just another reality.

This is revolutionary for its time. Now we have seen the schema several times since and there is more versions to come. However, this still plays well today. You will have to overlook the cheap cheesy electronic background music. O.K. and the cheap cheesy graphics.  However, there is a beautiful shot of the Pacific coast Highway.

Psychic Alex Gardner (Dennis Quaid) is compelled to take part in an experiment that as with any science can have a great impact for good or evil. Therefore, we need to figure out who are the good people and who are not.  He works with a beautiful doctor Jane DeVries (Kate Capshaw), his old mentor, Doctor Paul Novotny (Max von Sydow) and a mysterious authority Bob Blair (Christopher Plummer).

386032,4,6301933532,"I saw this movie when it first came out.  I liked it and found it had great writing and acting, well casted, and looking back, it WAS a great movie for the times.  Everything in the 80's was big; big guns, big muscles, big hair, big mouths and foul language.  This was one of the few movies that had some intelligence put into it for the times and instead of having millions of sense-draining special effects, it relied on very few graphic special effects and just good ol' directing and decent writing.  The only part I felt was 'weak' was some of the dream sequencing.  Because our dreams can seem more real and vivid than real life, and because of the very serious nature of the dreams in the lives of these characters, I would have embellished the dream sequences a bit more.  Seems like they were lacking a bit more detail.  But coming from a background as a Hollywood production background development artist, I would notice things that maybe some people wouldn't give a patoot about.  So  ignore my comments about the lack of detail in the dream staging of this movie if backgrounds are of no interest.

The acting is great and the writing is great.  Nice to see a movie come out of the 80's that wasn't all sex, violence, and foul language - and yet can keep audiences interested through the tension much like a Hitchcock movie.  It is understated on the surface but hits you with powerful surprises to keep you intrigued every step of the way.

Yesturday's audiences were not as anesthetized of their senses like today's audiences.  With all the Fx, graphics, and digital computerized effects that comes with movies like ""Inception"", I still didn't find ""Inception"" as interesting or written as well as this movie Dreamscape.  Dreamscape was the FIRST to explore what it would be like to make rescue operations while in the dream state and it was accomplished in a very believable way.  And the characters in Dreamscape didn't need drugs and medication to be induced to get their job done.  Seems like today's audiences can't believe the supernatural without some kind of drugs or physical manipulation explanation for everything.  With all of our technology and special effects and computerization sensationalizations up to our eyeballs, no wonder there is a lack of appreciation for good intelligent writing which relied on our imagination instead of having everything explained to us like children.  Dreamscape is an excellent move and after 26 years of watching movies, it still stands out in my mind as worthy entertainment value.  It keeps you on the edge all the way through!

Also, another excellently written and directed movie is ""Frequency"".  It is another very well written movie and keeps you guessing and on edge till the very end!",1287100800,5,2754,4.802547770700637

386091,4,6301933532,"I missed this movie in 1984 when it first came out; too busy raising the kids, I suspect. I've always admired Dennis Quaid's versatility and since I just saw him in the humorous role of Jerry Lee Lewis in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Balls-of-Fire/dp/B000063JDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Balls of Fire!</a>, I didn't switch channels when this came on TV.

I'm also a big fan of the newer high-tech special effects, so wanted to compare ""yesterday"" with the great graphics of today. I wasn't disappointed because I think the effects were quite dynamic for that era. I enjoyed the way the characters traveled back and forth between dreams and reality; I was properly horrified. The scenes were eerie, frightening, and fast-paced, just the way I like my action.

Good acting from Quaid, a psychic who gets involved in a government dream study where scientists Kate Capshaw and Max Von Sydow are wiring telepathic people into dreams of troubled people. Quaid refuses to join them at first, but wants to help a young boy get over his nightmares, so agrees to go into his mind. The intent of the program is to help people, but a corrupt government man (Christopher Plummer) has more sinister intentions. That's the general gist of the story...

I thought the premise was fascinating, building in tension as the movie progressed. The action scenes were fast-paced, scary and realistic (that snake monster actually made me cringe). The weak points in the movie were that some of the dialogue seemed too ""canned"" and some scenes weren't shot at quality camera angles.

Overall, I really enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamscape/dp/B0006Z2KFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamscape</a>; it was time well spent. If you like sci-fi action, you'll like it too.

While the sound was on par with standard DVD audio the picture was horrible.  The movie had all the little white static-like spots in every frame as if you were watching a high school reel projector movie.  It was VHS quality visuals.  Nothing is touched up visually from the original movie.  The green screen scenes are obvious.  And with barely 5 minutes of extras, most of which are still photos, this can hardly be considered a ""special edition"" of anything.

Image Entertainment has made a name for themselves releasing IMAX and concert blu rays.  Reviews of those discs have me scratching my head as to why they would release ""Dreamscape"" on blu ray at all when they enhance other films for the blu ray upgrade. It is apparent to me this movie came out to capitalize on the upcoming blu ray release of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" which shares some similar themes.

Do not buy this blu ray.  You can purchase the ""Special Edition"" DVD release here on amazon.com for $6.99 or this movie shows up in the Walmart $5 bin from time to time.  There is no difference in the quality of the DVD and blu ray releases except for the price.  Someone should prevent these companies from releasing ""fake"" blu rays at once.

386097,2,6301933532,"From the premise to the cover everything thing about this movie on the outside just speaks of an epic.  The cover especially has an Indiana Jones quality that adds to these expectations.  Unfortunately, the movie never reaches such epic levels and falls into a series of boring discussions and lack-luster action-sequences.

The general plot goes like this: Alex Gardner, a very very young Dennis Quad (gotta say that was a shining point of the film, even if his performance was so-so), is a psychic that gets wrapped up in this dream study funded by the government.  The scientists, including Kate Capshaw (Willy from Indiana Jones...thankfully she's more low-key in this), have created a way for telepathic people to wire themselves into dreams.  Of course the evil government guy has more nefarious plans for the project and that's where the general tension of the movie lies.

Ah yes the 'tension' of the movie.  Well my biggest complaint of 'Dreamscape' is that all the acting and thus action seems really flat.  This is most prominent in the dialog.  Almost everything conversation is between only two people who are standing still with the camera at the same distance.  Don't believe me...just try tracking this throughout the movie (if you do end up seeing this).  The best example is during the final part, when the tension has supposedly mounted, an actor gets out of the car and just stops to talk to the bad guy.  These talking scenes are about 90% of the movie and are delivered with only some gusto.

This movie is classified as a type of mind-bender but the realistic environments (even the dream worlds weren't that crazy) and normal camera angles didn't quite give me that test-of-the-human-psyche experience.  Sure everything is discussed and delivered nicely, but the plot doesn't really deviate from what it originally set out to do.  I think that's really what kinda bored me about the movie, it was a sci-fi action plot delivered like a mind-bender.

To be honest the movie wasn't god-awful and I can see why others would enjoy it, especially if they had seen it back when it originally came out in 1984. 'Dreamscape' probably won't entertain the eyes of the younger generation and only be appreciated by fans of 80's cult-style movies.",1261180800,,2258,4.902631578947369

Alex Gardner was born with certain ""talents"" - a telepathic genius - able to manipulate the conscious mind. But it is not until he is approached with an offer to further parapsychology that he learns just how profound his abilities can fathom.

Living a life of mundane concerns*, at the behest of Dr. Novotny {Max Von Sydow}, he returns to his former life engaging in psychical research to further the efforts of the mind to tap the abyssal subconscious, projecting into others' dreams, in what is essentially the practice of Lucid Dreaming, what some of us have already mastered. With the aid of a 'dream machine' situated in the 'dream chamber' {""Who's your decorator, Darth Vader?""; it is a nice chamber!}, which merely regulates bio-functions, it begins as a form of therapy, witnessing patients' fears, such as the man who suspected his wife of cheating {including with his brother, a priest, and... even you... Fakuda...?}; and the construction worker with bathophobia {fear of falling from high places}. The reality of the situations amaze Alex, who thereby dedicates his skills full into the project.

Upon reaching REM sleep state, each dream sequence is quite a remarkable spectacle {whose ingress, incidentally, very much resembles the I-Tunes visualizer}, with amorphous transmutations in light and sound surrounding until full presence is achieved.

Then he meets Bob Blaire, whose innocuous first introduction belies his true character as sinister mastermind, and later Tommy Glatman, a psychopathic dream killer obsessed with Martial Arts movies who actually murdered his own father. Blaire runs a top-secret organization within the CIA whose nefarious influence is all-pervasive. The two work in tandum and plan to assassinate the President {Eddie Albert**} in his dream by whatever imaginative scenario, utilizing dream weapons to achieve that end, which results in various stress and shock related maladies in ""dayside"" state. That is the ultimate idea herein - to cause reactive effects in which a kill in the dream results in the actual demise of the dreamer IN ACTUALITY.

Through entering the dream of an attractive female Doctor with what is essentially an incubus visualization, Alex eventually learns to project without the use of the machine, by merely stilling himself in a quiet, gloomy environment, initiating controlled breathing techniques {sounds familiar...}, he sharpens his senses enough to subsequently confront a serpentine creature known as 'The Snakeman' {a boogie-man archetype and Glatman's fearsome ""totem""} who has invaded a boy's dreams. From within a haunted house on a stormy night, down a twisting staircase into an inferno of horrors, the two battle the snake beast in a fantastical scene reminiscient of white knight verses dragon. Although in the dream world, anything is possible.

After the sad execution of Novotny ordered by Blaire, Alex and Tommy square off in The President's nightmare wherein the one with the greater imagination, cleverness, and willpower prevails. The Snakeman manifests again, and through a very shrewd apparition, the President is saved.

Demon hounds, a snake monster, nuclear zombies, sudden scares, cloak and dagger scenarios, secret government conspiracies, a motorbike chase, and horrific environments fill this dreamscape of nucleic creation.

386133,5,6301933532,"The photo makes one think of Indiana Jones (and Kate Capshaw, who was in ""Temple Of Doom"", is a good reason for the comparison), but this is more science fiction.  It deals with psychics who are able to enter people's dreams.  This puts it into the category of true science fiction, speculating possibilities, their benefits, and their dangers.

Dennis Quaid does an excellent job as a con man with an exceptional ability.  Max Van Sydow is just as good as his mentor.  Christopher Plummer makes an great villain.  And when somebody casts one of my favorite actresses like Kate Capshaw as the love interest . . .  George Wendt also is good in a brief role, and Eddie Albert is presidential.

I will conclude that the ending bothered me philosophically.  If someone wants to discuss it, feel free to let me know.  However, I don't want to spoil any surprises.

It is PG-13, meaning it is not for children;  feel free to attend with your junior high or older child, where you can discuss the issues with him.

386140,4,6301933532,"Dreamscape is a fun, if undeniably underrated, thriller from the early 1980s.  Dennis Quaid plays a psychic who is recruited into a secret, government-funded operation by Max Von Sydow.  Under the direction of Von Sydow and colleague Kate Capshaw, Quaid learns how to enter other people's dreams.  Amongst other things, this ability allows Quaid to romance the reluctant Capshaw and to help a small boy who is haunted by nightmares involving a demonic creature known as Snake Man (who, years later, remains one of screen history's scariest monsters).  However, Quaid also discovers that the real force behind the project is Presidential advisor Christopher Plummer and Plummer has somewhat more sinister goals in mind for Quaid's newfound abilities.  President Eddie Albert, it seems, is having nightmares of his own and there leading him to sign a disarmament pact with the Russians.  While Plummer makes plan to send his own personal assassin (David Patrick Kelly) into the President's dreams, Quaid and Capshaw struggle to save the President's life.

Dreamscape is an entertaining film that, luckily, doesn't take itself all that seriously.  The film itself is a hybrid of several different genres -- part horror film, part political conspiracy thriller, part speculative science fiction, and part comedy and director Joseph Ruben manages to pull of an impressive balancing act by seemlessly integrating all of these elements into a cohesive whole that actually holds together pretty well.  Ruben keeps the action moving nicely and brings a truly memorable flair to the film's dream sequences.  As stated previously, the Snake Man (a creation that would simply be a cartoonish computer-generated image if the film were made today) is still truly frightening and the President's nightmares, with their images of nuclear devastation, still retain their power to disturb.  Ruben also gets uniformly good performances from his cast with special praise going to David Patrick Kelly who creates one of the most memorably quirky and hateful film villians of the 1980s.  All in all, Dreamscape is a blast from the past that is more than worth tracking down.",1140220800,14,2152,5.278592375366569

It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch.

Despite the fact that the movie came out in 1984, the digital transfer to dvd came out great.  The quality of the pictures and sounds are excellent for this Widescreen Special Edition.

The story is original.  What would you do if you had the power to  enter people's dreams?  Through Max Von Sydow (as the head of the research facility) and Christopher Plummer (a high level government official), you are presented with two opposing philosophies on how this special gift should be utilized.

Like other reviewers mentioned, the cast gave wonderful performances.  I've never seen a young Dennis Quad performance before, and he played the role of Alex perfectly for this film.  I recognize Kate Capshaw from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and arguably she gave a better performance in Dreamscape despite having a much more passive role.  And Christopher Plummer played a very convincing villain.

I think this is a solid entry into the SciFi genre and certainly well worth what you can pick it up for on DVD.

The special effects are still nice to look at and the music was catchy. The whole premise of dreams being entered with electronic assistance is not so far from what we can do today. At the time it seemed far fetched, especially when it was done without electronic assistance. Granted that is still out there, but look at how far we have come in dream research and our capability to monitor and effect sleep. With current remakes of psychological movies like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" I wouldn't be surprised to see a remake of this one.

I rarely do...unless they are of the really intense kind and I wake up during the dream, and even then the images tend to slip from my conscious like grains of sand through your hand.  Why am I bothering telling you this?  Well, I needed some kind of opener for my review of Dreamscape (1984), a film that deals with dreams and such, and this was the best I could come up with at the time, lame as it may be...directed by Joseph Ruben, who later did Sleeping with the Enemy (1991) and Money Train (1995), Dreamscape presents quite a cast with Dennis Quaid, Max Von Sydow, Christopher Plummer, Kate Capshaw, Eddie Albert, and even George Wendt (Norm!).

Dennis Quaid plays Alex Gardner, a young man of fantastic psychic abilities who has since dropped off the radar, preferring to use his `gifts' to manipulate women and pick winners at the horse track, rather than continuing to subject himself to an endless series of tests meant to study and learn of his abilities, tests conducted by Doctor Paul Novotny (Von Sydow).  Seemingly content to squander his skills, Alex's path once again leads him back to Dr. Novotny and his assistant, Jane DeVries (Capshaw) as they've developed a machine that would allow someone with Alex's talents to enter the dreams of others, and possibly help those plagued with reoccurring nightmares, specifically in the President (Albert) who is suffering from apocalyptic dreams that are beginning to affect his ability to do his job.  Seemingly concerned with the President's well being, Bob Blair (Plummer), government head of Dr. Novotny's project and shadowy leader of an intelligence group even the CIA fears requests Dr. Novotny assist in relieving the President of these nightmares, but we soon learn he has other plans, plans of a sinister nature involving another, less stable psychic within the project by the name of Tommy Ray Glatman (David Patrick Kelly).  Can Alex uncover the plot, help the President, and stay alive?  Possibly, but the odds are certainly against him...

Given some of the films that came out in 1984 like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Ghostbusters, Amadeus, Footloose, Romancing the Stone, Starman, A Passage to India, and The Killing Fields, it's no surprise this `sleeper' got lost in the shuffle.  I've always enjoyed it, and thought it deserved a bit more credit than it's gotten.  Dennis Quaid is really good and charming as hell as the smart alecky Alex Gardner, a character who seems to be able to handle himself, yet exhibits a smidgen of naivet which possibly stems from a core belief of decency, despite his ventures into gray areas, specifically using his skills to determine winners of horse races, earning him money to live.  Max Von Sydow is also very good, although I feel as if I've seen him in similar roles so many times before, as a doctor involved in ground-breaking research, not being able to see the forces which conspire to use his research for their own, sinister means until it's too late.  As far as Kate Capshaw, I have to admit I've never cared for her all that much as I found her character in Temple of Doom to be highly annoying and distracting.  She's not bad here, even though she does suffer from a common malady of the 80's here in big-hairitis syndrome.  Plummer is good as the conniving powerful government agent with a secret agenda, although I've seen this whole `evil government stealing research meant for the good of mankind for it's own corrupted means' theme about a thousand times before.  Even so, he's perfectly suited for the part, oozing a smarmy, almost quiet charm that hides disturbing ulterior motives...I did like the aspect that his goals were driven mostly by his desire to protect what he thought needed protecting, even if he was misguided by his own sense of  twisted patriotism.

The special effects, while seeming quite dated now, were actually very good for the time this film came out, especially the dream sequences of the President detailing post-apocalyptic visions of decimated cities and ruinous wastes.  The stop motion work, while not really appreciated by many, is really pretty good and reminds me of those old Ray Harryhausen films I love so much.  One thing that annoyed me the most about this release is what's missing due to a hack editing job on a few scenes, all within dream sequences, I suppose, to more aptly fit the movie's PG-13 rating.  One scene involved Quaid and Capshaw and a romantic interlude on a train with some pretty steamy stuff, but here it's cut short, removing the nudity.  A second edited scene had Quaid inside a mousy man's dream about his wife, which contained some nudity that was excised out of here, and finally another scene has to do with Quaid's character helping a little boy overcome a terrifying reoccurring nightmare about a monstrous snake man.  The part removed had a bit of gore in it, but it certainly wasn't anything, in my opinion, that deserved to be removed.

It says the movie is available in full and widescreen anamorphic formats, but I only saw the widescreen format.  The picture quality is pretty good, but the transfer print does suffer very minor age deterioration at some points, but it's hardly noticeable.  The audio is much better, with Dolby Digital 2.0, new Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Audio available.  Special features include an audio commentary track by producer Bruce Cohn Curtis, writer David Loughery, and special effects artist Craig Reardon that's pretty good, although dry at more than a few points.  Also included are a behind the scenes special effects makeup test reel and a slide show.  I really wanted to give this four stars, but given that's it missing parts from a few scenes, I have to go with three...

386229,4,6301933532,"I saw the film now for the first time and were very surprised with the argument. A lot of parts are very similar to the ""Elm Street"" movies, which began one year later, even the knife-fingernails of the murderer, but especially that all victims were killed in their dreams.
I agree with the other reviews, the film has great performanes.
On the other hand there're a lot of mistakes and contradictions in the argument. For example, the last victim (the bad guy from the government) is killed although the protagonist is far away and can't influence his dream. But all in all I think you'll not loose your time seeing this movie, especially if you're a great science fiction/horror fan.",1058227200,,685,4.716666666666667
386230,3,6301933532,"I still can't believe they edited this DVD.  I remember this movie well - I saw it 5 times in the theater.  It is a good oldfashioned B movie.  Decent plot you can follow with poor special effects trying to be 'top notch'.  I was suprised at the quality of the acting at the time, and not shocked when I saw Quaid break through soon after.
The plot is basic horror stuff.  A man (Van Sydow at his 'nerdy proffesor' best) studys dreams, to determine if one person can actually enter another's dream.  Then comes in the Government agent (Christopher Plummer at his most evil) representing the true source of the study's funding.  They want to use this information to attempt to determine if they kill someone in their sleep will the person die.  If so the plan is to use this information to assassinate those not 'helpful' to America. Dennis Quaid plays the young college dropout who is recruited for the study, and Kate Capshaw his love interest.  The battles are fought in dreams.
If you've never seen it in theaters, rent this one tonight.",1023062400,4,1040,4.548387096774194

And being able to get it in BLU-RAY format was icing on the cake. The quality and speed with which I received this product is extremely satisfying. If there is a catalog of what is available I would appreciate it. Thanks.,1526256000,,356,4.578125

7817801,1,6301933532,"I cannot really review the movie because ... it's my fault ... I bought a U.S. BD when, ironically, I'd learned of the insidious DRE from Amazon itself. Yes, this is a scheme to prevent foreigners from putting a Region 1/A disc in a multi-region player. I don't know anyone in Australia who _doesn't_ have one. And I don't understand the rationale for such arbitrary policies.

It certainly isn't ""to protect the cinema owners"" (and that lie never passed the smell test). More likely it's about control of market share. That leaves those of us who've paid honest money for a product we cannot view thinking ""IP Awareness"" is a sick joke.",1506038400,,637,4.6875
7817802,5,6301933532,"I  am  glad  to  own  this  movie  again.  I  did  have  it  on  VHS  until  it  got  messed  up.
I  like  these  kind  of  movies,  this  one  is  pretty  decent.  There  really  isn't  that  much  blood  shed.  So  don't  worry.
Alex  is  a  gambler,  &  uses  his  so  called  gift.  He  has  his  friends  &  foes.
The  beginning  with  the  presidents  daughter  running  from  the  atomic  bomb,  &  the  president  just  having  a  bad  dream  will  soon  become  the  focus  on  the  movie.  &  that  someone  wants  him  out  of  the  way.
The  movie  is  scary.  &  gives  you  an  inside  look  at  what  our  world  would  like  after  a  nuclear  explosion.
There  is  at  least  5  different  dreams  Alex  experiences,  first  having  an  accident  with  a  skyscraper,
first  encounter  with  the  evil  snake  man,  &  helping  a  couple  resolve  a  love  affair  problem.
Having  learned  that  young  Alex  will  eventually  become  a  threat,  Bob Blair  (Christopher Plumber)  wants  him  dead  &  out  of  the  way.  &  he  &  his  employees  are  willing  to  do  anything  to  takeover  the  dream  research  company,  &  kill  Alex,
&  Paul  (Max Von Shadow).
&  once  becoming  a  professional  &  not  needing  the  machine  Alex  must  focus  all  his  talents,
&  stop  Tommy  Ray  who  has  gone  psycho  &  Bob Blair,  &  save  the  president  before  its  too  late.
The  movies  great.  Terrific  scares.  You  got  great  music  in  the  movie  that  kind  of  music  that  almost  makes  you  feel  as  if  your  visiting  a  haunted  house.  &  all  the  unusual  things  that  can  only  happen  in  the  dream  world.  &  don't  worry  that's  not  always  true  what  Bob Blair  said  (when  you  dream  that  you  die  you  die  in  life,  during  the  dream  before  you  get  out  of  your  dream).  I've  dreamed  that  I've  died.  &  I'm  still  alive  &  well.
&  I  recommend  it  to  anyone.
Its  what  I  call  decent  horror  movie.",1502150400,4,1983,4.242990654205608
