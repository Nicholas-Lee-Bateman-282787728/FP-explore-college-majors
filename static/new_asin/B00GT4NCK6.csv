8627300,5,B00GT4NCK6,"I have always loved this irreverent series about an 18 year old who dies from  being hit by a toilet seat from the space station. Rather than going to the hereafter, or wherever we go when we die, George is told that she is now a reaper - - someone who helps others pass to the other side when they die. Ellen Muth plays George with just the right amount of sarcasm and naivet with her fellow reapers, including boss Mandy Patinkin. If you don't take life or death too seriously, this is the series for you.",1424390400,3,507,4.22680412371134

8627302,5,B00GT4NCK6,"""Dead Like Me"" is a wonderful series that is loosely based on the first ""Incarnations of Immortality"" book by Piers Anthony, ""On a Pale Horse.""

""Dead Like Me"" easily deserves five stars, but ""On a Pale Horse"" deserves even more.

This movie is not an adaptation of the book, but it is the inspiration.

Let me give you a comparison between the book, On a Pale Horse (PH) and the TV Series and Movie, Dead Like Me (DM), and how they might agree with each other (AGREE):

WHO ARE THE MAIN PROTAGONISTS, BEFORE THEY BECAME IMMORTAL?

(PH): Zane is an average run-of-the-mill, down-on-his-luck, unsuccessful former photographer, who is so depressed that he is about to give up on life. Computers and advanced equipment have made it very hard for Zane to find work, so hard that his camera is in hock, and he's about to be kicked out of his apartment. We see quite a bit of Zane's pre-Death (note Caps) existence in numerous pages, and in some flashbacks later in the book.

(DM): George (Georgia) is 18, mostly disillusioned with life, a college dropout who does not have many, if any, friends, who practically ignores her younger 11-year-old sister. Her mom has to force her to go out and find a job, and wants to kick Georgia out of the house. Mostly we learn about her life in flashbacks, because she dies in the first minute of the movie.

(AGREE): Both mortals were experiencing lives in which they were dissatisfied with their existences. They were just getting by in their drab existences, and looking at evictions from their homes.

CAPITALIZATION OF DEATH

(PH): In all eight ""Incarnations of Immortality"" books, Death, when used to describe Zane, is capitalized because he is one of the major Incarnations, Thanatos, along with Time (Chronos), Fate (Clotho / Lachesis / Atropos), War (Mars), Mother Earth (Gaea), Evil (Satan), and Good (God). Years later, Night (Nox) finally gets her own book, which I'm looking forward to reading after I reread books 1-5, then 8, then 6-7.

(DM): In the TV series, death is not capitalized, because George and the other grim reapers are all subordinates of the actual Incarnation of Death, who we never see.

HOW DO THE CHARACTERS BECOME IMMORTAL?

(PH): Zane, totally disillusioned, decides to end his life. While he is pulling the trigger, Death in his black cloak walks in the door. He can't stop his finger from pulling the trigger, but the shock of seeing Death helps him move his arm, and he ends up murdering Death, who had been so careless not to close his impenetrable cloak. Any person who murders Death becomes the new Death.

(DM): Georgia is killed by a toilet seat that came from the old MIR space station, turning her into a spirit. She soon finds out that the grim reaper who had retrieved her soul had just met his quota, so she has to take his place because he has retired to his next life. It was just luck that she became a grim reaper than that the previous or the next soul to be retrieved.

(AGREE): Zane does not die, he is a human being who becomes Death, and will remain immortal until he chooses to leave the office or he is careless. Georgia (and all grim reapers) must die before they become immortal.

HOW DO THE CHARACTERS KNOWS WHICH SOULS TO RETRIEVE?

(PH): Chronos, the Incarnation of Time, feeds all the information into Zane's DeathWatch, which not only tells Zane where to go, but how much time he has until he must take the soul.

(DM): A never seen character delivers a list of every death to Rube every morning. Rube gives George and the other grim Reapers their information for that day's collections on post-it notes.

(AGREE): We could easily decide that Chronos gives the information to his subordinates, who deliver the lists to all the supervisors, like Rube, around the world.

WHAT IS THE CHARACTER'S TERRITORY?

(PH): Zane collects souls all over the world.

(DM): Georgia's group only collects souls in the Seattle area.

(AGREE): They could easily be in the same world, but Zane is always somewhere else.

WHICH SOULS DO THE CHARACTERS COLLECT?

(PH): Zane only collects the souls of those people who were so close to perfectly balanced that his subordinates do not know if the souls are destined for heaven or for hell. He has magical instruments that can help him decide where each soul must go, or if he can't figure it out, he can take the soul back to Purgatory where even more precise equipment is available.

(DM): Georgia and her associates only collect souls who were surprised at their deaths, my way of describing the list or circumstances, which include a lot of accidents.

(AGREE): The grim reapers in the TV show could easily be the subordinates that the book talks about, who take care of all the normal passings, leaving the tough cases for Zane to handle.

WHEN DO THE SOULS GET COLLECTED?

(PH): Zane collects the soul after the body has died, but the body cannot die until the soul is removed.

(DM): Georgia's group do their best to collect the soul before the actual death, but the body remains alive until the accident. If they do not get to the soul in time, the body is dead, but the soul is aware of everything that is happening to the body, including any autopsy.

HOW THE CHARACTERS GET AROUND

(PH): Zane has a Pale Horse, which can also turn into a beautiful car, boat, airplane or whatever Zane needs to get him there.

(DM): The characters must get around on their own, but eventually, some of them acquire cars which can make it easier. Most of the grim reapers need to get jobs so they can pay for meals, lodging, etc.

CAN THEY CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE A LIFE?

(PH): At first, Zane had no choice, but eventually, he learned that he could make choices, and Fate and the others would have to make changes, like Fate reweaving part of her web, the tapestry of life. Chronos could even help Zane by taking him through time so he could undo something that happened so a boy could live.

(DM): The reapers are pretty much stuck. If they choose to change a character's fate by moving objects or causing the person not to be where the death would occur, there are almost always consequences to pay, such as worse outcomes than would have occurred otherwise.

ARE THE CHARACTERS VISIBLE TO MORTALS?

(PH): Only people near death can easily see Zane, or any people Zane chooses to let see him. If he is seen by others, the people usually see him as someone that they'd expect to see on the scene. Very religious people can see him as Death. When Zane takes off his robe, people see him as he was in life. When his hood covers his face, Zane's face looks (and feels) like a skull. When he wears his gloves, his hands look and feel like bones, but return to normal human look and feeling when he removes the gloves again.

(DM): The grim reapers are totally visible, but except on Halloween evening, they always appear to be someone different than who they were in their mortal existence.

CAN THE CHARACTERS BE KILLED?

(PH): As long as Zane is fully dressed, he is invulnerable to any attack, even from Satan or other immortals. The reason the prior death was killed was because he had grown careless, and had not covered his face with the hood.

(DM): The grim reapers heal very quickly and cannot be easily killed, and in fact, none of them are killed in seasons one or two of the tv series. The other reapers do manage to destroy a particularly obnoxious, even evil, grim reaper in the movie, but they REALLY had to work at it.

ARE THERE ANY CREATURES IN THE SHOW THAT ARE NOT IN THE BOOK?

(PH): The book focuses on free will. Yes, Fate knows when each creature will die, but there are no evil creatures going around making accidents happen. Every creature has choices that affect its future. There are no creatures that deliberately make accidents happen.

(DM): Gravelings are strange creatures that only some of the grim reapers, and only a rare human, can see. They go around making accidents occur, like loosening wires, moving a banana peel, etc.

IS THEIR UNIVERSE ONE OF MAGIC OR ONE OF SCIENCE?

(PH): Science and magic coexist in the book's universe. Jet airplanes fly passengers across the ocean, but flying carpets can be used to get from place to place on land. Some average humans have magical powers.

(DM): This appears to be a universe of science. The only characters with supernatural powers appear to be the grim reapers and the gravelings. No humans have magical powers.

RECOMMENDATIONS

I highly recommend both the books and the television series. Don't forget the movie which came afterward, but don't watch it until you've watched both seasons of the TV show

I also recommend that you read Piers Anthony's excellent Incarnations series. You can read books 1-5 (and probably 8) in any order, but do not read book 6 until after you have read all of books 1-5 (and possibly 8); and do not read book 7 until after you have read all the others.

If you like my review, please say so, and if you have any questions, feel free to add a COMMENT below and I'll get back to you.",1406160000,9,9013,4.587905236907731
