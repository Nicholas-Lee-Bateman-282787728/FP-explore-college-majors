6019612,5,B00FPT727U,Eddie Aikau should be a household name because of all the hundreds of people's lives he saves who were literally in over their heads in the waters of Hawaii.  A great humanitarian to the end when Eddie attempted to find help for the stranded Hokule'a.  Follows the book printed by BESS Press very well,1414022400,6,301,4.555555555555555

6019616,4,B00FPT727U,"The best message related to Eddie's life is:  He was not a hero because he excelled at a sport; he was a ""hero"" because he was willing to take an incredible risk on behalf of others.  ""Eddie would go.""",1406937600,5,201,4.128205128205129
6019617,5,B00FPT727U,"I first saw this film  on PBS and couldn't wait for until it was released on DVD.  After reading several books and hearing stories

himself for his people and his culture. So much Aloha.",1403308800,8,306,4.545454545454546
6019618,5,B00FPT727U,"This is one of the top five surf documentaries.  Poignant, with details of his final days.  Details of his impact on others who knew him.  I remember a Discovery Channel docu of people who almost lost their life.  A 60-something Caucasian tells the story of Akai saving his life when he waded too far out, back in late 60's.  He one of many who owed his life to Lifeguard job of Akai at Waimea Bay, Oahu.  Special Features also with Rabbit Bartholemew.",1389052800,7,452,4.451219512195122

Some trying to make surfboards in woodshop.  So why is it I never heard of Eddie Aikau?  I knew about Endless Summer and various board manufacturers like Hobie, and guys like The Bull. Interesting story...and tragic.",1528934400,,388,5.126984126984127

There was a patch sewn onto the shorts commemorating Eddie Aikau, so I asked the Lifeguard about him but always wondered about the truth of the story. Such a great video and a must for all surf fans.
