2753269,4,B000N30RJS,"This DVD is really good and it brought back alot of memories.  The quality and clarity is great, the entertainment is fantastic.  This is back in time when there was quality entertainment on tv with people that are actually talented.  The only complaint that I have is that these are not complete shows.  For instance, in the openers, they used to have singing and/or dancing and that's not included in most of these shows.  It's a real shame that they didn't release the entire show.  Some of the programs do have some skits included which I think add to the show.  Anyway, if you were an 80's child and you liked this show and country music, I don't think you'd be disappointed in purchasing this DVD.  It's really good.",1267833600,8,722,4.542635658914729
2753270,5,B000N30RJS,I am very impressed with this seller. It was like almost overnight from the time I ordered this item and it was delivered only in a couple of days. Excellent service. I definitely would order from this seller again.,1244678400,,215,4.538461538461538
8174277,5,B000N30RJS,"The Mandrel sisters are SO talented.  Any Country music fan, and even those (like me) that are not Country music fans, but are just looking to relax and enjoy some quality entertainment, are sure to like these DVD's.  Additionally, if you grew up in the 80's, remember the 80's, or are curious about what the ""vibe"" of the 80's was, these DVD's will take you back.",1515801600,,364,4.5
8174278,5,B000N30RJS,Loved their show and love this set that lets me relive some of the past years.,1418169600,,78,3.9375
8174279,3,B000N30RJS,loved watching the show but was hoping could find the show in seasons and not just clips,1414281600,,88,4.235294117647059
8174280,2,B000N30RJS,"This was definitely not the ""Best"" of Barbara Mandrel - too much silly skit stuff and not enough of her superb singing, playing instruments and dancing - Guest singers were good but there were many more that could also been used",1395014400,,228,4.585365853658536
8174281,5,B000N30RJS,When I am searching for an informational source I have used Amazon many times for that purpose. I watched these shows in their 'heyday'. Great musicianship and not many examples available. Amazon's Software documentation and education resources are excellent and I have found the whole process is very rewarding. I have been very satisfied with the product and the delivery. I would use again!,1388880000,,393,5.15625
8174282,4,B000N30RJS,This is exactly what I was looking for. It brought back a lot of old memories of her TV show.,1388793600,,93,3.7
8174283,4,B000N30RJS,"Product was as expected. With most of the current TV programming not worth watching, it's nice to be able watch some of the older shows again.",1388534400,,142,4.5
8174284,5,B000N30RJS,"You can't pass up an opportunity to capture time in a bottle like these three DVDs of this show, with those three knockout sisters, and all the stars of that time that they had on.
Of course, we can't recapture the past, but no one's trying to.  It's just fun to have a little light-hearted entertainment to look at once in awhile, and see these ageless girls doing their thing.
It's no different than having a DVD of a good movie, where you see the stars in all their youthful glory, knowing they will never age, and will always look as great as they did then.",1341705600,,561,4.2924528301886795
8174285,5,B000N30RJS,I really enjoyed watching this DVD set! Barbara Mandrell is one of my favorite performers and this DVD set is a must for all Barbara Mandrell fans!,1332460800,4,147,4.481481481481482
8174286,3,B000N30RJS,"While the quality of this DVD is excellent, it isn't exactly what I was hoping for.  Rather than it being full length shows, it is excerpts from various episodes throughout the show's run.  I always enjoyed the opening number and the dance numbers the most and so far, I haven't seen any of those (but I've only watched most of the first DVD in the three DVD set).  If you enjoyed the guest stars more, this DVD set is for you.  If you (like me) preferred the dance numbers and opening numbers more, keep looking.",1321228800,5,513,4.368421052631579
