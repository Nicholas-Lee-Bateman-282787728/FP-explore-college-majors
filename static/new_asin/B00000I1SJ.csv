Most of the songs are song by people who would have a hard time getting gigs at Holiday Inn lounges.  The videos themselves have nothing to do with the lyrics of the songs since the director thinks that all of of the songs can be summarized visually as ""bimbos in cheap bikinis (or other forms of revealing clothing bought at K-Mart).  Not that the director could have done much with the actors.  The girls look like strippers at a low-class country strip clubs and have the same level of acting ability.  The guys look like Sears catalogue models who are either semi-nude or are wearing tacky and cheap cloths and they have the same dopey ""I am posing for the underwear shoot"" expression no matter what they are supposed to be doing in the video.  You will be terribly disappointed if you buy these terrible DVDs.",984182400,23,963,4.4375
7909239,3,B00000I1SJ,"Hello,
There is a song missing on this dvd,  Killing me softly. I bought this dvd for the next numbers: my way, whenever i call you friend, show me the way, if you leave me now, fame and killing me softly.  So you  understand that i was disappointed. For the rest it's a fine dvd.",951091200,7,280,4.054545454545455
