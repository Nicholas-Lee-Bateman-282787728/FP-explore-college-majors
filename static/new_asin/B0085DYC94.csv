5132851,5,B0085DYC94,"This movie is a must see for everyone in America and the world. Do you feel something is wrong in our country but not sure what? This film will open the door to that question and if you are open to its reality it will not just open the door but it will kick it in! Filled with a literal who's who of educators and scholars in finance, history and the principles of the Constitution. You want your country back? Are you tired of the over reach of big government invading into your home and life? Then this film is your first step to the cure. It is a literal investment in your future.",1339632000,33,584,4.131578947368421
5132852,5,B0085DYC94,"Nowhere to turn, the truth just kept pounding on my conscious, beating me into prideless submission. Unlike most projects that drone on and on until, eyes glazed, you fall asleep. The combination of professionals, statesmen, entrepreneurs, musicians, figures from history and the heartfelt Americans, known and unknowns, coming forward with their witnesses, was a wonderful thrill-ride building the case of the true conspiracy in our midsts! This is an awakening clarion call for the People to use as a foundation to start their own research into the truth that has been denied us for far too long. If you or a loved one is still 'asleep-at-the-wheel' this work will awaken you to the lateness of the hour! BRAVO, BRAVO, & congratulations on completion of an excellent project!  I look forward to the continuing story to come forward as time permits for production of the saga. JB",1339632000,44,880,5.027397260273973

It communicates a lot of important truths in a way that is relatable and understandable to any common person, rather than in that scare tactic, conspiracy-theory kinda way that scares people off.

5132865,5,B0085DYC94,"Pale Horse goes into detail on whats been happening in America for many years. Having been involved in the political system for over 23 years I've learned a lot about the ""power brokers"" the deal making, deceptions and that which is carefully screened for public consumption vs the truth. Government was and is about control. Government in America has become an all consuming maggot interested only in preserving its power and control. The Constitution, Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence was drafted by men who knew well the tyranny of a dictatorial regime.
The film goes into agenda 21 in depth; the agenda that the power hungry deny exists. ""(See Democrats against agenda 21). This is the playing out in real life of the Communist Manifesto.
Highly recommend it to those who are ready for the truth. We are losing our liberty at an alarming rate. Our schools have been dumbed down over the last several decades to where they don't teach the history, the Founding Fathers and the documents that, by their signing, could have cost them their lives.

Our country is falling under a Socialist / Communist form of government. The President is bent on tearing America down until it is the same as other 3rd world countries. His tactics are in line with other Dictators. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves this country and our freedoms. People must wake up NOW or find themselves in chains, doing what they are told, where they can live, what and when they can eat. This will be like Russia, and Germany in the 1930's.

5132870,4,B0085DYC94,"I bought this out of curiosity and because my son's college class had talked about conspiracy theories in one of his classes. There is also another video which was panned by many which was a supposedly ""home made' video by the author of a book by the name . Because I like Charlie Daniels' music I decided to purchase it out of curiosity. There are some alarming points presented (pertinent to today's happenings) and some good points are made by a variety of different people. The problem with this is that they  take too many people and consequently make the video too long. If you purchase this to show to someone to try to change their mind (or open it up) I don't think you would have much success because they would lose interest due to the length. This could have been a good video to show in an American Problems class or Sociology class as a lead-in to classroom discussion (and still could be if you take excerpts). Also, they periodically put in a gentleman to portray George Washington and it loses its effect -pretty corny-could have been more effective without the ""acting,"" actually made me roll my eyes.",1383004800,4,1119,4.595

5132884,4,B0085DYC94,I think it is enlightening for those who follow only the main stream media.

5132898,5,B0085DYC94,"I've been ""awake"" for over 10 years now, so this information really isn't new to me, but the documentary covers an enormous amount of info that might just blow the minds of some people who are just coming out of the ""sleep mode.""  The newbies are going to have to go research the facts brought forth for a deeper understanding. The ""rabbit hole"" is deeper than one can imagine.  Many people just can't believe that anyone can be that evil or have that much power to enforce their evil agendas on them as this DVD acknowledges is happening. Most people are generally ""good"" or believe themselves to be ""good"" and no one could be that evil. But when you look around at what is happening, you begin to see and hear the truth. Suddenly you realize the truth. It can be scary. Once you learn the truth, you can't go back. You now have the responsibility to speak it and let more people know about it.

However, there will always be those people who will refuse to see or hear the truth and continue to go along with the evil agendas. May your chains rest lightly on your necks.

I loved the format of this documentary. The switching back and forth between the experts being interviewed was refreshing. There were serious conversations and some light hearted conversations that made me laugh. (Gerald Celente and Charlie Daniels have unique ways of getting serious messages across in a light hearted manner.)

Yet Agenda 21 is so insidious and extensive that it's hard to get people to listen to much of an explanation.  With its appeal to the emotions and the awesome country music of Charlie Daniels, this film is the perfect tool!  I thank God for it!

It mixes country common sense wisdom, faith, and patriotism with a good dose of quotes and commentaries from George Washington, and information from experts who KNOW and have researched.  It is definitely good on an emotional level for getting people involved.  I have lots of films with scholarly documentation on Agenda 21, but was also needing one that would appeal to the emotions.  This is it!  I plan on using both to get my friends and family off the fence and into the arena to humbly pray and diligently work to restore America.  We may not be able to do it.  But because of my love for the America that stood for God's principles, I'll go down trying!  Give me liberty or give me death!

It is most unfortunate that some continue to ignore the warnings and claim a conspiracy theory.  The fact of the matter is that none of this is hidden from public view.

If you rely on respected NON-PARTISAN fact-check sites like factcheck.org, politifact.com, and snopes.com, you can easily debunk all these types of silly and ridiculous constructionist, fabricated memes.

This is desperation at its finest, and it is wasting YOUR time, your life. Think about it. You are only hurting yourselves by willingly staying deluded and squandering your precious time and energy.

Therein should lie your motivation to seek truth instead of just things that fit and support your ideology.

If it is true, based on respected sources, then fine, but otherwise give up the hunt and use your remaining time on this earth more productively.

5132914,5,B0085DYC94,"Prior to purchasing this DVD, I examined the reviews and almost did not buy it because a few complained of the production speed in viewing.  However, I am so glad I bought this DVD, as the production is highly professional and the speed of information that flows is just fine.  I had no trouble following the speakers and the cut-aways, etc., and felt each piece of information was related solidly to the prior piece.

PROS:  The content is incredible and calls forth action from every patriot.  The quality of the guests / speakers is amazing.  I never heard of most of these folks, but they are passionate, learned, skilled, and very convincing.  What comes across is everyone's sincerity in their topics.  Charlie Daniels as a narrator is wonderful, and his down-to-earth style of speech and mannerisms are refreshing.  The speakers are divided between men and women, and the women rock!  These women in the film really know how to teach.  I am going to re-watch this DVD several times, and wait for the next in series.

CONS:  There is a small section in the film that focusses on Biblical Eschatology, as in the ""coming of the Anti-Christ,"" and the ""mark of the Beast"" type theology.  However, when it comes to Eschatology (the study of end-time or future prophetic events), no one group has the definitive answers. It is just my personal pet-peeve to hear any one group of ""theorists"" talk as if their view is the only correct Biblical view.  Understand, I am not referring here to Doctrines or Fundamental Theological system of salvation, but end-time or prophetic ""theories"" espoused to be definitive truths.  So, when the film diverts to the topic of Eschatology in explaining the ""mark of the Beast"" or the ""Beast"" as Anti-Christ, it proposes an ""INTERPRETATION"" of the book of Revelation.  And there is no one system of interpretation that has all the answers to such a book.

However, I still give this film 5-stars because overall i found it good and rewarding.  My personal bias and peeves about Eschatology should not come in the way of preventing anyone to see this film.",1347235200,,2087,4.795518207282913

understanding of what is going on in the nation and the world.  It is must watch for everyone. Gives a good understanding of our past and our future.  Look forward to seeing more.",1346630400,,319,4.283333333333333
5132916,5,B0085DYC94,"How to start this review. Let me see. If you bow the knee to the Republicans or Democrats this is not the video for you. If you like living life with your head in the sand this is not for you either. But if you like truth and seek truth and have an understanding that things are not what they seem then this video is for you.

Charlie Daniels is an awesome speaker and when he begins to talk I found myself glued to what he was saying. He and many other liberty seekers are representing in this film what I have been warned was coming in the Baptist church all my life. The one world govt, one world money, one world economy with a few upper crust controlling the world.(Antichrist is what it is called int he Bible). This is much out of Revelation in the Bible. So I was not surprised at this revelation as it is what Dr. David Jermiah, Irvin Baxter and Dr. Jack Van Impe have been speaking about for a while. What this video does that is different than these preachers is they name names and places and like I said if you love the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas and Kissinger and Rockefeller you will get angry at this video.

But I have read Revelation and much of Daniel and Ezekiel and I know who wins. The end time process has begun I just hope America does not continue on the path of marking their citizens with the chip.  I hope she will stand apart from the other nations and be a friend to Israel in these end times.  The video gives documentation of where we as American's are heading and what is happening in our nation.  If the viewer of the film has a spine and an open mind they will want to watch this dvd.

One suggestion for the film makers is to caption the Jewish woman as it is difficult to understand her.  But I got the point that the general was speaking of where we are at today in America and as a Jew in Germany under Hitler we have similar paths.  And we are on this path because of the names mentioined in the first paragraph.",1345852800,27,1958,4.161375661375661
5132917,5,B0085DYC94,"This is one of the most MUST SEE documentaries I have seen.  The film is FACTUAL, REFERENCED, CREDIBLE, and above all, PURELY BASED ON TRUTH AND FACT.  Whether you are an Atheist or a Christian.....we ALL have a right to FREEDOM AND LIBERTY.  This film isn't about simply gaining control of our true America, it is about gaining control of Freedom and Liberty GLOBALLY.  Every man, woman, and child of the World deserve both.
TRULY A WAKE UP CALL, I recommend this film for citizenship classes, city council meetings, coffee houses, churches, access television, military personnel, policemen, ...exposure to any and all.  Get it, watch it, share it..... before it may be taken off the mass market.

This movie not only will open your eyes to what exactly it is our government is doing but, it will also inspire you to make changes, which is exactly what needs to be done.
I am a college student and I urge anyone in college, or high school, to watch this movie. Our parents cannot fix this on their own. They need EVERYONE in the fight to bring back the America we love!",1344816000,,543,4.333333333333333
5132920,5,B0085DYC94,"If so you must see the movie on the brink of going viral, ""Behold A Pale Horse.""

The cast (Gen. Jerry Boykin, Gerald Celente, Dr. Stan Monteith, Larry Pratt, Joel Skousen, Dr. Katherine Allbrecht, Jim Marrs, and Michael Shaw to name a few) do an absolute fantastic job at explaining the situation every American faces. For too many years I dismissed the United Nations as a non-player in world events. That is until I saw the footage in this movie!

The message is laId out in a concise manner and is easy to follow. One is kept on the edge of their seat from scene to scene with anticipation and an appetite to learn more. It's moments before midnight and the end is drawing near. As America goes so goes the rest of the world. This is a must see movie.

And in case you were wondering Charlie Daniels and Mark Collins (who plays George Washington) are nothing short of amazing.

5132921,3,B0085DYC94,"This information and warning to our country is both timely and greatly needed but I must admit that I was extremely put off and distracted by the constant scene changes and the switching back and forth of speakers.

My husband and I would be trying to absorb the information that we had just heard when it would quickly jump to something else.....and this continued on, all the way to the end.  We also did not like the dramatic heart-pounding music that played in the background throughout most of the documentary.  I know that this was added to evoke emotion but it simply was not needed since the ills of our country evoke enough emotion in most Americans already!  The music also made it hard to hear and understand the speakers at times.

With that said, I do appreciate, and I am thankful, for this first part of a three part series.  I only hope that the producers pay close attention to constructive criticism so that these things can be ironed out in the next two parts of the series. God bless!",1344384000,15,1004,4.519337016574585

Our forefathers that set up our republic and gave us the Bill of Rights and The Constitution are currently rolling in their graves as they witness the wholesale assault on our individual freedoms and states rights. A one world government is not what they envisioned and we must stand together as Americans to stop it in it's tracks by holding our elected officials accountable on both sides of the aisle. The documentary ""Behold a Pale Horse"" gives the viewer an idea of what we as freedom-loving Americans are up against.

This dvd is a blessing from The Good Lord for us.  The filmmakers' and participants' heart, soul and patriotism are obvious in this work and you will have much more knowledge and wisdom about what is happening to us right now.

5132928,5,B0085DYC94,"I saw the film when it was first shown at the Fredericksburg Film Festival a couple of months ago (and then I bought the DVD too).  It was electrifying, and the standing ovations went on and on.  And rightly so.  And what an experience it is! I am someone who tries to follow as much of the alternative news as I can fit into a day, and this is especially helpful to share with friends and family, the ""doubters"" who won't listen to you trying to wake them up to the ugly truth that's happening to America and the world. Especially also, but not only, those who you feel sense there is something awfully wrong in America. I particularly like and appreciate the fact that so many participants in this film have contributed to it in their own ways from so many perspectives.  Kudos to all!! This DVD gives so much detail in so many ways that a lot of it will have to start sticking in the minds of even the most reluctant audience. It's so utterly important and the hour is late - so please get this out to as many people as you can. This is something to see and absorb by EVERYONE, the novice to finding out the truth as  well as the deeply concerned well informed folks.",1340409600,5,1170,4.252252252252252
5132929,5,B0085DYC94,"Finally! Someone has concisely organized so many important voices in one place. THIS IS A MUST SEE for every citizen in America. I really appreciate the way Charlie Daniels asks us not to take his word or to necessarily believe the content of this artistically mastered film, but to go and DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK after seeing this. This WILL OPEN YOUR EYES and make you want to dig deeper and investigate this topic. The documentary's website provides more follow up info and allows you to preview who will be among those interviewed in the next volumes. The historical vignettes are well done and that really connected me to the depth of patriotism of our founding fathers. George Washington is awesome in here.
It is no longer a conspiracy theory when the evil of the world has published material calling for the abolishment of all private property rights and such drastic measures as an 85% reduction in global population. THIS IS YOUR WAKE UP CALL FOLKS. ""We need a thousand Paul Reveres'"" You nailed it Charlie!

Our country has lost its way and if we the people don't stand up claim back our freedoms the enemy will take over! However, it jumped around so much, (different people talking about one subject and not keeping in consistency with one subject at a time), I found it very hard to stay focused & follow the message. I appreciate the fact that Charlie Daniels and all those involved are trying to do something to wake up America. But with too many voices speaking all at once & flipping back & forth we lose our focus on what the DVD message is all about. When it was all said & done I just didn't like the way the producers put this one together.",1340236800,7,788,4.225165562913907

This is really not a indepth documentary you will have to look up all the terms and groups this DVD talks about. I didn't care for the way the director kept switching back and forth with the video of interviews with people it just seemed too disorganized maybe they wanted to get ""part one"" out quick to make a quick buck. But I won't be purchasing the other parts if they are ever released. Just a terrible production of what could of been a lot of good information.",1340150400,5,560,4.3428571428571425
5132933,5,B0085DYC94,"The ""Behold a Pale Horse"" DVD is very accurate and timely, because it tells the real truth about what is going on in America. Chuck Undersee has assembled a very knowledgeable cast of experienced Patriots, who tell it like it is, as they have witnessed what is going on.  Tell everyone who will listen to purchase a copy of this GREAT DVD and share it with all of their friends and relatives.
