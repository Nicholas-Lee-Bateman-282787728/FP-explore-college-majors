7915427,5,B0000296R2,This is one amazing movie with good actors and directed by one amazing director Yuen Woo Ping! Highly recommend this movie!:),1391385600,,125,5.0
7915428,5,B0000296R2,"One of the most imaginative and fun martial arts flicks of all time. My favorite Yuen Wo Ping film by far. Taoism Drunkard, Shaolin Drunkard and Drunken Dragon are the 3 films that most resemble the free flight creativity on display here but Miracle Fighters is the best of the bunch. I would love to see other martial arts films that are in the same vein if anyone can recommend any others.

I can't see how anyone who appreciates martial arts films and good films in general could not REALLY enjoy Miracle Fighters. It's one of those rare films that truly surpasses its genre. Don't hesitate to buy this DVD if it is available on Amazon as it seems to go out of stock for long stretches at a time and becomes hard to find otherwise.",1253318400,,734,4.397058823529412
7915429,2,B0000296R2,"I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of Yuen Woo Ping, but came away wondering what it was all about. There were some martial arts in it, but it seemed to be mainly some sort of stream-of-consciousness comedy that I didn't get. There's a whole lot of plot that doesn't really go anywhere, and some wire fu that seems to be there because he can do it, not because it has anything to do with the movie. I guess when you do as many movies as he does (sometimes 3 in a year) you're bound to end up with a few like this one.",988934400,,521,3.9245283018867925
7915430,4,B0000296R2,"This movie is one of the best fantasy/comedies from hong kong that I have seen. Yuen Woo Ping (Drunken Master, Magnificent Butcher, The Matrix) directs and choreographs this gem with great humour, inventiveness and  flair. The sets and cinematography are also top notch. Some of the wacky  set pieces include ""a pedal-powered massage chair, a feather  barometer, a homonculus-like baby, masks, flying drills, and a fighting  stick-man"". The film culminates with a tournament of sorcerers which  is great fun. Many people that aren't die hard fans can find hong kong  Cinema a bit of a chore but this is one of the films that will be enjoyed  by anyone with a sense of humour and a taste for the bizarre and wacky.  Also the Martial Arts scenes are fantastic - fast and furious with some  stunning choreography - check it out!",959644800,,825,4.794326241134752
