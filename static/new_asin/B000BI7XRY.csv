8086947,3,B000BI7XRY,"A semi-interesting dvd, but can become terribly boring with an endless loop of design by four artists accompanied by a variety of musical selections. 140 minutes of not-so-good ambient music (don't expect anything creative like Brian Eno or Harold Budd), too long, and not appealing to non-designers I suppose.  Available at Conran and online for $20.",1416873600,,351,5.267857142857143

8086949,2,B000BI7XRY,"A beautiful way to give at the music a color theme and atmosphere to your personal space. 'lso this maybe good for cafe, hotels or metro stations etc.",1217462400,,150,4.392857142857143
8086950,4,B000BI7XRY,"Put in the disc, hit ""Play All"" and forget about it.  The scenes repeat.  I play my own music and the TV room has a nice glow without the distracting chance of people actually watching a program.",1168646400,4,195,4.243243243243243

8086952,5,B000BI7XRY,"A very soothing, visual tour-de-force. It's the perfect companion if you want gallery style on a budget. Celebrities step aside, Colorcalm is gonna run a technicolor gamut through your pixelbox.",1145836800,6,194,5.5
8086953,4,B000BI7XRY,"I did yoga to this for an hour this morning. I was just going to do 30 minutes but I was so relaxed and felt so great, I just kept going.

Not something you want to sit down and stare at but definitely great background ambience.",1143504000,4,228,3.9565217391304346
8086954,5,B000BI7XRY,"Upon popping this disc into my DVD player, my living room immediatly became ten times classier.  My TV went from a gaping black hole, to a pretty cool piece of moving art.  I doubt that anyone in their right mind would sit down and watch this DVD from start to finish (unless you are a huge Peter Saville fan or are really stoned), but thats not what this is made for.  Really, it's quite elegant and well done.  Definitely cooler than those fireplace/fishtank DVDs.  I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to add something different to their apartment/home.",1139961600,17,565,4.666666666666667
8086955,2,B000BI7XRY,"The majority of this DVD, visually, is pretty non-descript.  It's essentially color in motion.  Music is so relaxing it should be in a spa, in which case you wouldn't see the video cuz you're sleeping!!  Only a true Peter Saville fan and/or New Order fan can appreciate this but, although I do, it is not a must buy.  Peter Saville is a graphic genius, that being said, go buy a book about him...and if you must, borrow this DVD from a friend and burn it.",1139961600,4,455,4.317647058823529
