8048993,5,B0007MUS5S,I used this on my now 17 year old and now 13 year old and am about to embark on another pain free adventure tomorrow with my third child who has just hit 5. I think you could do it earlier if the peddle a lot and / or have a stryder but I'm just get round to it. This really does work. I paid first 2 times but now it looks like you can stream a version on youtube - there is a mechanism to pay and I think people should but it's there for free / pay what you want,1503705600,,464,3.5588235294117645
8048994,5,B0007MUS5S,"The guy who invented this should be a millionaire -- instead he's only making a little money selling this idea on the internet.  My kids are big now, but I taught the first one (a total bike-o-phobe) to ride in 5 minutes using this technique.  The second one had been riding with training wheels (which the inventor tells you will predispose the kid to lean to one side and thus make it harder to learn) and it took me 25 minutes to teach him. :)  Both kids will tell you fondly how they became instant big riders thanks to ""pedal magic.""",1465776000,,538,4.306930693069307

8048996,5,B0007MUS5S,"Anything that is patented is described in a patent filing. If you want to know the Pedal Magic technique before buying, look up the patent (search for ""method for teaching an individual to operate a bicycle"". It won't give you a step-by-step practical guide to implementing the technique - if you want that buy the video. The technique is smart, so 5 stars.",1429833600,,357,4.682539682539683
8048997,5,B0007MUS5S,"Go to the website (I'm sure you can figure out the address) and buy the video online--I don't believe they're producing DVDs any more. Seriously, I was quite skeptical about the promises, but I figured a money-back guarantee removes the risk, so I paid up. The exercises are quite simple, but nothing like what I expected. (Do you wonder why I don't describe them? Well, the guy who came up with the technique asks people not to pass it on, and I'm happy to comply--read on to find out why.)

See, I wasn't teaching myself--I can't even remember when I couldn't ride a bike. And I wasn't teaching a little kid, either. I was teaching a hard-headed young lady of 16, who was completely convinced that she ""just couldn't"" ride a bike. ""Lessons"" in the neighborhood high-school parking lot, from both me and her uncle, were spectacularly unsuccessful. Crash after crash. We were just reinforcing ""I can't"" with our well-meaning efforts.

So I figured, what the hell, let's try this video. We watched it, we practiced the exercises in the garage for about 20 minutes, and then we walked down to the parking lot, and JUST LIKE THAT, I launched her and yelled ""GO, GO, GO!"" and she rode away across the lot in a big sweeping circle like she'd been doing it all her life! I was absolutely dumbfounded. Delighted, too, of course.

Seriously, this is something different and unique. None of this ""take the pedals off the bike"" stuff, no ""push it like a scooter,"" no training wheels, nothing like that. Your kid (or grownup) will be RIDING THEIR BIKE as though they'd been riding for ages. I think the guy who came up with this technique deserves every penny. I think you will agree, if you just give it a try. It's exciting and amazing to watch.

(I know, I know--I sound like the Shamwow guy or something. I'm really not. I'm just so thoroughly impressed that I'm writing a review, five years after my kid finally learned to ride her bike.)",1406851200,,1932,4.591304347826087
8048998,5,B0007MUS5S,"We bought this video because our daughter was 9 years old and very fearful of riding a bicycle. I sent my husband down to the local park and it's parking lot and in 35 minutes they returned triumphant!

He had her riding the bike in 10 minutes and she didn't fall once- amazing! No one could have been more fearful than our daughter and we were astounded by her success.

Please try this- it works!",1390176000,2,398,4.293333333333333
8048999,5,B0007MUS5S,Pedal magic is easy and it works!!! My daughter with spastic diplegia learned to ride in 3 sessions. I would recommend it to anyone. Worth every penny.,1362873600,,151,4.62962962962963

8049001,2,B0007MUS5S,I guess this works for some people but not for me. It is very simple but I believe a bit over priced. I did not learn to ride with the advice on this tape. Searching the web for free advice is the best just type in learn to ride a bike.,1239926400,,236,3.6470588235294117
8049002,5,B0007MUS5S,"I purchased this as a download on the web, so I haven't seen this video, but the system worked really well for my 5 year old.  We had been struggling to teach him to ride without training wheels and he just wasn't getting the hang of it.  We tried Pedal Magic and in just a few practice sessions, he was riding like a pro.  It DOES take a bit longer than the 5 minutes promised, but for us it was about 3 sessions of 15-20 minutes each before he had it down pat (after spending hours of frustration running alongside the bike before seeing the Pedal Magic sustem).  All I can say is that it worked for me.",1199232000,6,605,4.101694915254237
