8700817,5,B00T797C9M,"Udin is a lucky orphan orangutan who is raised in captivity and is released into the wild by The Orangutan Project (TOP), a not-for-profit organization. If there is one place you can actually see how rewarding it is to release a captive animal into the wild, it should be in Sumatra. Asia's most intelligent ape, orangutans once roamed across the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java, but today, fewer than 7,000 Sumatran orangutans remain in the wild. 85% of the Sumatra's orangutan can be found in an area three times the size of Yellowstone National Park, in the Leuser Ecosystem, where it harbors the most sophisticated orangutan culture on Earth. Orangutan which translates into ""People of the Forest"" is a very calm and relaxed type of monkey specie, not territorial and do not leave in groups. Mother orangutan gets to raise one offspring at a time for ten years where they get to be with each other day and night. In order to protect these orangutans from poachers, they are raised in the very dense northern jungles of Sumatra where TOP volunteers have to travel some twelve hours along the edge of the coastline to get to these very remote forests. If you ever want to see some extreme four wheeling, then you can see it in this documentary. It is just unbelievable how well those Toyotas are made since they go through rivers and washed off trails especially in the wet jungles of Northern Sumatra. Raising these orphan wild orangutans not only is a difficult task but a human mission. Rapid deforestation of these original and productive forests seems to be unstoppable by the same families who need to live off the land by burning the forests as well as well as other family members in being active workers in protecting and raising those orphan orangutans. A very complex issue. Big Agra, log and burn the original forests to make way for vast lifeless palm oil plantations and for animals from orangutans to elephants to tigers, it is becoming impossible not only to enjoy the freedom of forest but having a home to live while becoming refugees and declining in population.

In few decades none may be left due to human activities so watch this informative and touching documentary with your kids. You can go to orangutan.org.au to donate and even adopt an orangutan while saving forests of Asia for many other species including humans. I got to see ecologist Chris Morgan in a bear documentary. Chris is a well spoken individual who not only stars in his documentaries but narrate as well. What a good choice by the producers of this well done orangutan documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1424908800,6,2605,4.788888888888889
