8233919,2,B000YQL6LC,"With all respect to the late Christopher Lee, this is possibly the worst of his Fu Manchu films. This particular version of his 4th Fu film is a toned-down , less explicit rendition (not necessarily a bad thing) of the movie  with an alternate title.",1442275200,,250,4.555555555555555
8233920,2,B000YQL6LC,This is the cheesy  fourth entry in Lee's  Fu Manchu series originally titled The Blood Of Fu Manchu. This time the arch-fiend is in Brazil where he infects ten beauties with a deadly poison they transmit to anyone they kiss. The girls are then sent out to give Fu's most hated enemies a fatal smooch. Not the worst of the series but still pretty mediocre and seems to have been cut from a spicier Euro-print.,1202947200,,409,4.44
