This dvd is the 4th installment of ROH's retail set, and it's a classic.  It showcases some of ROH's best matches, built on rivalry, be it professional or personal.  I have to tell you that these matches are or were definite candidates for Overall match of the year, respectively, in my opinion.  If you are new to ROH, or would just like a good compilation of matches as an ROH fan, this dvd is for you.  Don't skip on the other three: Best in the World, Bloodstained Honor, and Stars of Honor.",1231459200,,609,4.45045045045045
3167325,5,B00175GAEW,"ROH, although still a relatively unrecognised promotion has done a lot for the wrestling industry. It has helped build and develop such big name stars like Samoa Joe and CM Punk, and it has given the hardcore wrestling fans something to take their mind off ECW. ROH has to most fans given us some of the most memorable moments in a wrestling ring, in its short 6 year history than the WWE has given us in its lifetime. Forget the monday night wars, experience CZW vs ROH and then you have a true company battle for supremacy.

This, another excellent addition to the ROH retail DVD set, this one showcases the best matches from the best rivalries in ROH history. Raven challenging the ideals of CM Punk, Samoa Joe & Homicide brutalising each other and BJ Whitmer against Jimmy Jacobs taking it to a whole new level of extreme violence are just some of the great rivalries that took place over the history of the company. Now doubt, however is that the one that got the wrestling industry talking was CZW vs ROH. This was a clash of styles with ROH being all about Honour and purity whereas CZW was all about violence, blood and weapons. This was truly the Monday Night War for the independent circuit, which ended in possibly the most violent match to ever take place in an ROH venue.

Match List:

CM Punk vs. Raven (Dog Collar March- Elizabeth, NJ, 7/19/03) CM Punk is Straight Edge, he doesn't drink and he doesn't do drugs, which at the time gave Punk the assumption he was better than most. Raven sought to teach him otherwise.

Samoa Joe vs. Homicide (ROH World Title Match- Wauwatosa, WI, 7/23/04) Both very fast and talented individuals in their own way and they needed to prove which was the better man.

AJ Styles with Mick Foley vs. Jimmy Rave (Lake Grove, NY, 9/17/05) This was the fight of the original vs the copycat with the original Styles Clash vs Rave Clash.

Jay & Mark Briscoe vs. Austin Aries & Roderick Strong (ROH World Tag Team Title Match - Liverpool, UK, 8/12/06) Briscoes easily one of the most talented tag teams in the business going against the remaining members of Generation Next.

BJ Whitmer vs. Jimmy Jacobs (Steel Cage Match- Detroit, MI, 3/31/07) These are easily two of the most hardcore and craziest people on the ROH roster and every time they get in the ring together they almost kill each other. I have had the privilege of seeing these two kill each other live when ROH came to Liverpool in the UK and let me tell you it's even more graphic in person.

Bryan Danielson vs. Austin Aries (3rd Match In The Best of Three Series- Philadelphia, PA 11/2/07) I have to be honest I'm not very familiar with their feud and I'm actually surprised this match has been put in in replacement of a Danielson vs McGuinness match.

Adam Pearce, Ace Steel, Colt Cabana, & BJ Whitmer vs. Claudio Castagnoli, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher, & Spyder Nate Webb (Team ROH vs. Team CZW Anything Goes Match - Dayton, OH, 4/28/06) I would have preferred the Cage of Death match, but this match is just as insane and has some excellent bumps and real violence.

Roderick Strong vs. Erick Stevens (FIP World Heavyweight Title Match- New York, NY 12/30/07) I actually haven't seen anything of this feud either, but from what I've heard this has been a very hard hitting battle between the two strong men

It's an excellent choice of matches, at least from the ones I've seen but I'm genuinely surprised that there wasn't a Danielson vs McGuinness match as I think a lot will agree, that's been one of the more intense feuds in the entire ROH history.

Excellent set overall and is something every wrestling fan should own.",1220227200,3,3634,4.582434514637905

2. Samoa Joe vs. Homicide (ROH World Title Match- Wauwatosa, WI, 7/23/04) - great match, but I so would have put their match from FYF: Finale on here instead.

3. AJ Styles with Mick Foley vs. Jimmy Rave (Styles Clash vs. Rave Clash Match- Lake Grove, NY, 9/17/05) - one of 2005's best feuds, it's hard to believe how over Rave was as a heel during this time

6. Bryan Danielson vs. Austin Aries (3rd Match In The Best of Three Series- Philadelphia, PA 11/2/07) - INCREDIBLE match from the best mini-series I've seen in years.

8264881,5,B00175GAEW,"Like most wrestling fans, I've been frustrated trying to find worthwhile wrestling.  WWE is more determined to prove they are providers of ""long running episodic television"" where the sports part of sports entertainment takes a back seat.  TNA is determined to prove they know sports entertainment better then WWE, but fail miserably.  While both will occasionally put a respectable match on TV, this almost seems like accident.

Enter ROH.  There current TV show has consistently good wrestling shows, with lots of ""bell to bell"" action as good old JR would say.  If you can't find their show, it is available for streaming free on their website.

These DVD collections are a great way to catch up on ROH's past and see recent WWE & TNA stars doing what they do best.  CM Punk is shown here in a great dog collar match, as part of his feud with ECW original Raven.  Other current WWE stars seen in this collection are Cesaro (Claudio Castagnoli) and Daniel Bryan (Bryan Danielson).  More recent TNA stars Samoa Joe, Austin Aries and AJ Styles are also featured in this collection.

Long time ROH stars the Briscoe Bros., Roderick Strong and Jimmy Jacobs are also featured in some classic matches.

8264882,5,B00175GAEW,"For those who don't already know, Ring Of Honor (ROH) has been around since 2002 & has been called by many as the top independent promotion in the world based off the labeling of being an ""entertaining sport"" than ""sports entertainment"" due to a heavy focus on the aspect of in-ring professional wrestling resulting in the development of stars who have gone to be become top talents & even World Champions in other major organizations including C.M. Punk, Bryan Danielson (Daniel Bryan), Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, and Austin Aries just to name a few.  ROH released a series of DVD's a few years ago showcasing their matches & this one in particular focuses on their greatest rivalries in the company's history hosted by Lenny Leonard & Dave Prazak.

Dog Collar Match: Raven vs. C.M. Punk - Punk attempted to get out of this match & run away only to find out he couldn't with Raven using the chain to whip & choke Punk while also making him bleed using whatever else was around him before it took desperate tactics to regain control & gave the same punishment he received with the chain & taking advantage of the environment around him to also make Raven bleed as the fight continued throughout the crowd & in the ring with both men using chairs & the chain to their advantage while Punk continued to use his words to verbally attack Raven as well.  This was a violent bloody match with both men taking as much punishment as they gave.
""Death Before Dishonor"" July '03

ROH Champion Samoa Joe vs. Homicide - Homicide's crew of The Rottweilers were removed from ringside early as both men started off trading strikes & kicks & hard chops with Joe focused on wrestling with moves like a long vertical suplex while Homicide resorted to more brawling tactics with eye pokes & back rakes causing Joe to retaliate ramming Homicide into the guardrail on the outside.  Both men continued to trade momentum with Homicide focused on Joe's neck with aerial offense dropping a knee to the back of the neck to dropping Joe's weight onto it with a neckbreaker & piledriver while also mocking the fans & Joe which came back to haunt him as Joe executing power moves such as various powerbombs & powerslams & suplexes along with working over Homicide's neck with his own piledriver & muscle buster.  This was a very competitive match.
""Death Before Dishonor II"" July '04

Finishers Match: A.J. Styles vs. Jimmy Rave - With the story behind this feud being Jimmy Rave taking A.J. Styles' ""Styles Clash"" finisher as his own ""Rave Clash"" that the first man to hit their finisher on the other would be winner with special stipulation that the loser can never use the finisher again but Prince Nana was in Rave's corner & Mick Foley, making his final ROH appearance, was in the corner of Styles.  Styles took control early with aggression going aerial with a high dive over the top rope & high elevated elbow drops with both men brawling on the outside from ringside to the stage area tossing each other into guardrails with the action later continuing with weapons coming to play both men feeling the effects of a broken table on more than one occasion to more than just the legal participants using a chair.  This match saw a ""hardcore"" side of both men that we usually don't see from them.
""Glory By Honor V"" Sept. '05

ROH Tag Team Champions Austin Aries & Roderick Strong vs. Briscoe Brothers - This was held under special circumstances as it was ROH's United Kingdom debut with this also being the Briscoe's final shot at the tag team titles as both teams were evenly matched early on exchanging chest chops as their offense against the other varied with unique offense individually such a full nelson applied using the legs & one man launching himself off one opponent to knock the other off the apron & suplexing one man into the other while both teams showcased a heavy amount of teamwork together with various combinations such as chop & brainbuster, Razor's Edge & Diamond Cutter, missile dropkick & powerbomb, top rope spike piledriver, springboard Doomsday Device, and powerbomb & 450 splash.  This was a very strong tag team match full of non-stop action between two team that were evenly matched from bell to bell.
""Unified"" Aug. '06

Steel Cage Match: B.J. Whitmer vs. Jimmy Jacobs - Former ROH Tag Team Championship partners feud leads into this cage match with Jacobs starting the match off with a bang right away with a suicide dive out of the cage only for B.J. to respond sending him into the cage multiple times before things got more violent with a chair becoming very instrumental with being used to attack both men with chairshot & other unique ways to their faces & backs to the point where there was bleeding from the mouth & a tooth getting knocked out with things getting even more violent with weapons used by both men on each other including steel spikes & barbed wire baseball bat that carved up various body parts along with both men sacrificing themselves just to hurt the other more while another important figure in this feud made her presence known as well.  The commentators perfectly summarized this match as it was ""absolutely barbaric"" with both men coming out of the match a bloody mess.
As a side note, it's no secret that B.J. Whitmer recently retired & made statements in regard to the heart of Jimmy Jacobs in & out of the ring with this match being a perfect example of it.
""Supercard Of Honor II"" Mar. '07

Bryan Danielson vs. Austin Aries - This was the finals of a 3 match series to determine the #1 contender for the ROH Championship as both men were evenly matched with Aries heavily focused on controlling the arm with multiple armdrags & armbar before Danielson heavily focused on submissions such as a crucifix stretching that trapped the head & leg & arms along with others such as triangle choke causing Aries to pick up the intensity with offense such as a suicide dive that drove both men against the guardrail to the point where both men eventually knocked each out out at one point as they continued to show signs of knowing each other so well that you saw them reverse & counter each others signature moves & submissions including those they used to beat the other in their previous two matches.  This was very competitive & that got more intense over time.
""Glory By Honor VI"" Nov. '07

Anything Goes Match - Team Ring Of Honor vs. Team Combat Zone Wrestling: Adam Pearce, Ace Steel, Colt Cabana, B.J. Whitmer vs. Claudio Castagnoli, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher, Syder Nate Webb - This was a rarely in wrestling as two independently owned promotions declared war on each other allowing so many crossover appearances & invasions of one promotion into the other.  This started out with Samoa Joe calling out Team CZW leading to nothing but absolute chaos as it was an all out brawl in & out of the ring to the point where the announcers left for their own safety as chairs were being thrown all over the place & guardrails being tossed & people being put through tables with not everyone coming into the fight healthy yet still dishing out punishment as Whitmer was wearing a neck brace delivering chairshots & Pearce had 20 staples in his head while giving piledrivers on the ramp.  This wasn't a wrestling match or even be classified as a wild brawl, this was a riot.
""Weekend Of Champions"" Apr. '06

Full Impact Pro Champion Roderick Stong vs. Erick Stevens - For those who don't already know, Full Impact Pro was the sister promotion associated with ROH for a time.  Strong heavily worked over the back using the environment around him like the apron & guardrail & floor to make his normal offense have more impact along with various submissions stretching the back with Stevens coming back with offense such as a full nelson slam as both men traded momentum with Strong continuing to work over the back & Stevens attempting to wear down Strong with power offense as both men delivered moves such as a superplex, TKO, powerslam, backbreaker, and release german suplex.  Good back & forth match.
""Final Battle"" Dec. '07

While the debate of the greatest feuds will always be debatable, they did a great job here in choosing a diversity of matches showcasing the different types of rivalries throughout the company's history up from those based strictly off in-ring wrestling ability to those more personal to the point where it was very violent & bloody.

8264886,5,B00175GAEW,"Though this is an ROH release, I would put their action up against anyone past or present. That includes WWE, TNA, ECW (original one), AWA, WCW/NWA, World Class, Mid-South/UWF or Mid-Southern!

To this release itself, it starts slow, picks up in the middle and kind of cools down at the end BUT there isn't one bad match on here! Let's get to the matches:

C.M. Punk Vs. Raven (Dog Collar Chain Match) - This was the blow-off of their feud as C.M. Punk was looking to make a name for himself at the expense of Raven and push his ""straight-edge"" philosophy (similiar to his feud with Jeff Hardy in WWE and his short lived group ""The Straight Edge Society""). While I've seen worse (no D.C.M. matches Piper Vs. Valentine from the early 80's), it has its moments! Ends when Colt Cabana comes in and DDT's Raven, allowing Punk to get the victory.

Samoa Joe Vs. Homicide (ROH World Title Match) - It begins as basically a 4 on 1 match as Homicide had a manager (can't remember the name) and his Rockwiler partners (one of which was Low-Ki, better known to WWE fans as Kabal) at ringside but the referee quickly banned them for this match. From there, it was a back and forth bout with both men taking the other's best moves! Have to admit, Homicide's tougher than I thought! He even survived Joe's ""Muscle Buster""! In the end, Joe would retain his title after using his Kokina Clutch/Chokehold to knock the ""187"" out for the win! The last laugh would belong to Homicide however as The Rockwilers came back out to beat Joe down! Great match though!

BJ Whitmer w/Daisy Hayes vs. Jimmy Jacobs w/Lacey (Steel Cage Match) - This has to be one of the craziest cage matches ever! This is not only wild by ROH standards, this could've easily have been part of ECW lore! It is that violent! Chairs, tables, railroad spikes and even the dreaded barbwire baseball bat is used in this one! Adding to the mayhem was the respective seconds for the wrestlers though they weren't that much of a factor other than to get their respective charges some weapons! Ends with an awesome backsplash through a table that has to be seen to be believed!

AJ Styles w/Mick Foley vs. Jimmy Rave w/Prince Nanna - In this match, the first to use their version of the face-first piledriver (Styles Clash) will win the match and the loser can no longer use that finisher! This was a pretty intense affair that was mostly athletic as very little weapons were used save a chair and a table at the end. Speaking of the end, it comes when A.J. gives his ""Styles Clash"" to Rave from the ropes.....THROUGH THE TABLE! Also, check out the post-match speech from Mick Foley. Hilarious!

Jay and Mark Briscoe vs. Austin Aries and Roderick Strong (ROH World Tag Team Title Match) - Hard hitting tag team match! Admittedly, this opened my eyes to Austin Aries as I have only seen his heel work until I watched these recent ROH DVD's! He is tremendous! The Briscoes (no relation to the late Jack Brisco and his brother Gerald Brisco) are an awesome tag team and I've always liked Roderick Strong! If you have an itch to see good tag team wrestling action, this match is for you! I won't give away the finish on this one but needless to say, the winner earned this victory!

Team ROH (Adam Pearce, Ace Steel, Colt Cabana & BJ Whitmer) vs. Team CZW (Claudio Castagnoli, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher & Spyder Nate Webb) - This is just a straight up fight with some very brutal spots! For those that like a wild brawl, this match is for you!

Bryan Danielson vs. Austin Aries - This was part of a best of 3 match series. The matchup here is the third and deciding bout! Both men really showed their wears here. And, as I said in other reviews on ROH stuff, if all you know of Bryan Danielson is his Daniel Bryan persona in WWE then you really need to see one of these releases! And, as I said earlier, Austin Aries is tremendous! Move after move and counter after counter that ends with a victory for Aries!

Roderick Strong vs. Erick Stevens (FIP World Title Match) - FIP was a training ground for ROH wrestlers. These two were their top guys. Roderick, the champion in this match, was the heel but both men got their share of cheers! Admittedly, this match was slow and methotical but does have some nice spots. It does pick up towards the end and sees (in my view) an upset as Stevens beats Strong for the FIP title!

Overall, this is a good release!",1306368000,3,4398,4.465753424657534
8264887,5,B00175GAEW,"Well, Big T is back from a long absense from amazon with another review that i actually put on here. I did not put that WM 26 review on here. Anyway.

Dog Collar Match-Elizabeth, NJ 7/19/03
CM Punk vs. Raven
This match actually surprised me a little bit and turned out to be good. Some very slow and crappy action with Raven dominating in the opening minuets, until the weapons came into play. I enjoyed watching this match and actually found it entertaining and that i had a match from the early days of ROH. 3.75/5

ROH World Heavyweight Championship-Wauwatosa, WI 7/23/04
Samoa Joe vs. Homicide
Well, in my opinion, this was more of a TNA match than a ROH match. Becauase in those future years, they would end up being signed by none other than TNA. But, this match had its moments and feautures these two athletes on the cover and back. But, this was a very nice technical match and i also enjoyed this one. But the two styles of these guys when there in the ring is great. 4/5

Steel Cage-Detroit, MI 3/31/07
BJ Whitmer vs. Jimmy Jacobs
Another great match on the greatest rivalry dvds. These guys can really put on a show in the ring. Both somewhere in there leauge, big men. But these two just finally settled the freakin crap inside the steel cage. Some blood(of course), and a whole lot of action. I really liked this match and what they had done to build the rivalry. 4/5

ROH World Tag Team Championship-Liverpool, UK 8/12/06
Austin Aries and Roderick Strong vs. The Briscoe Brothers
Well, this is gotta be my favorite match on this card, even though it wasn't a ppv. These guys just went out there and beat the holy hell out of each other. Some great moments. A DDT on the stage, highflying action, and when the match just got to the point where no team would loose. Well, these are my favorite tag teams here at the time and the briscoes still are, its just this is and will always be the best match on this DVD. 5/5

Anything Goes match-Dayton, OH 4/28/06
Team ROH(Adam Pearce, Ace Steel, Colt Cabana, BJ Whitmer) vs. Team CZW(Claudio Castagnoli, Super Dragon, Necro Butcher, Spyder Nate Webb)
Holy Freakin Cow. Can a match be anymore either hardcore, go anywhere else in a arena, or just down right crazy. I think not. We saw Joe come out and cut a promo on CZW and how ROH can beat their sorry ass's. Which led to a 4 on 1 beat down, before the rest of the team could get there. But as we saw, i think it was Adam Pearce, which got his neck broken after being slammed through a table and landing on his head on the outside. But i enjoyed this match and the total brutality, but i wasn't happy with the ending. 4.5/5

FIP World Heavyweight championship-New York, NY 12/30/07
Roderick Strong vs. Erik Stevens
Pretty nice match going on here. I have always been inpressed with strong and his in-ring ability and the action that Stevens brought to his matches. But, i had a nice feeling about this match when i got it and i was happy with the turn out. I don't have much to say about it, but i know that you will enjoy it. 4/5
