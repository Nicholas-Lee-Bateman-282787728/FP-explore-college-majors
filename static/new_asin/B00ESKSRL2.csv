5940160,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I have been teaching Pilates since 2006, and this DVD has been a huge help to me in terms of understanding how the work I do with other people affects them in their circumstances.

Before I watched this DVD I simply had no idea that bone density issues were so prevalent and such a risk factor for otherwise healthy people, and how the traditional Pilates method can actually cause serious injury to such people.

Now, the first thing I do when I meet a new client is ask them about their bone density status. Many people don't know, and many people who do know don't understand what it actually means to them, so will try to do things that are seriously contraindicated if you let them.

This DVD gave me what I need to be able to work confidently and safely with these people while also giving them a really challenging workout, so they don't feel like they are being coddled or treated like a cripple.

What I like just as much as the technical expertise is Teresa's orienting philosophy that Pilates and development of physical health is a practice, not something you just do once and then forget about it. I like the way Teresa helps me and my clients to stay engaged.",1380240000,5,1173,4.4672897196261685
5940161,5,B00ESKSRL2,"""BoneSmart-Pilates"" exercise DVD for those with osteoporosis (and for all who are interested in keeping strong) is a wonderful DVD, and Teresa is a beautiful, life-giving teacher. The confidence I have in Teresa's teaching is based on her solid background of physical therapy and pilate training and years of professional dance. As someone in my 70's living with osteoporosis I find her sequences both trustworthy and stimulating. Her strengthening exercises are refreshing, graceful and lead you into health. Highest compliments.  Carla (Arthur's wife)",1380067200,14,553,5.662650602409639
5940162,5,B00ESKSRL2,"As I get older, I worry more and more about my bones.  Having suffered thru frozen shoulders, first left then right, I experienced for the first time -- steroid shots and much physical therapy.  I wish I had this DVD before all that happened.  I'm sure I would have been able to avoid it all with regular pilates.  This DVD takes PT above and beyond to the next level.  What's great about this DVD is that Teresa has a tutorial before each section and breaks down the exercises for the novice beginner (me!).  You learn what to watch for in terms of correct posture and what's not correct.  Then you get the actual demo with different additional individuals joining the sessions to follow along with once you understand the sequences.  Meticulously thought out, Teresa's teaching is easy to follow and I look forward to using this DVD to strengthen and tone my body and bones in the privacy of my home.  Nothing else I've seen is quite so comprehensive and full of material for any age and any body type.",1379980800,20,1004,4.533333333333333
5940163,5,B00ESKSRL2,"If you are interested in a Pilates DVD that works those bones as well as those supporting muscles, this is for you. Teresa M. is knowledgeable as well as accessible as she explains and demonstrates the moves. As an Instructor this has been an invaluable tool in bringing fresh bone-building exercises into classes. The perfect combination of Pilates and physiotherapy. Thank-you Teresa for making this DVD available in Canada.",1379635200,8,426,5.188405797101449
5940164,5,B00ESKSRL2,"As a beginning Pilates student, I found BoneSmart Pilates extremely valuable in explaining the basic principles of form and movement that are necessary to build bone strength and prevent injury.  Teresa Maldonado Marchok is an excellent teacher and her method of demonstration is easy to follow and moves at a very manageable pace.  For me personally this is a very satisfying life changing experience and I highly recommend BoneSmart Pilates!

5940165,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I have been a Pilates Reformer student for about six (6) months and have a great instructor.  Since I have severe osteoporosis, I bought this DVD to learn more about how to do Pilates without injuring myself.  When I got the DVD, I invited a friend of mine, and fellow Reformer student, over to watch it with me for the first time.  Both of us were extremely impressed with the level of detail that Teresa went into with each exercise.  Teresa described safe ways for osteoporotic people to do each exercise safely as well as imparted a wealth of information about keeping your bones healthy while describing how to do each exercise safely and correctly.

It was obvious that Teresa's background as a physical therapist is supplemented by a lot of additional research into osteoporosis.  This DVD is not just for osteoporosis but is also for people who want to keep their bones strong.  My friend who does not have osteoporosis really liked the ""bone dance.""  She felt that she learned a lot from this DVD as well as I did and wants a DVD of her own.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to keep their bones strong or for anyone, like me, who has osteoporosis and wants to keep from injuring themselves.",1378944000,33,1216,4.566820276497696
5940166,5,B00ESKSRL2,"Teresa Maldonado Marchok is a licensed physical therapist as well as a Pilates expert, so her understanding of the body is way beyond your average Pilates teacher.  She has been teaching Pilates to people with Osteoporosis for years and is an expert in the field.  You are in good hands with her.

In addition to having seen the DVD (which, by the way, is absolutely full of useful material for people of any age or physical condition), I have been doing physical therapy with Teresa for about a year.  She really knows her stuff.  She is very tuned in to detail, which is what makes this DVD so good.  She goes to great lengths to break down the exercises and to troubleshoot any potential posture corrections that you may need.

I like that the breakdowns are separate chapters from the workouts, which means that once you have already heard the explanations you can simply skip them next time and go straight to the workout.

Overall it is a 5 star DVD!",1378425600,40,956,4.549707602339181
5940167,1,B00ESKSRL2,I was really disappointed in this DVD and returned it while shocked by the restocking fee I wasn't aware of.  It seemed as though it was a two hour commercial for the other products mentioned for the exercises presented.  The production was not something I had expected with the white glaring background. The exercises and the whole presentation left a lot to be desired.  I did not like this DVD at all.,1475107200,16,404,4.583333333333333
5940168,5,B00ESKSRL2,Nice video for older folks like me.,1473724800,3,35,4.142857142857143
5940169,1,B00ESKSRL2,This is not what I was looking for would like to return,1464652800,,55,3.6666666666666665
5940170,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis at age 57 in the spine and hip. For two years, I tried other DVDs for osteoporosis, but never had total confidence in the safety of the exercises or my ability to perform them safely.  I consulted a Physical Therapist, who developed a daily routine for me, but I found it difficult to retain important information about proper posture while doing exercises without a video reference.

Finally, in fall 2013, I stumbled across Teresa Maldonado Marchok's DVD.  In fall 2015, my DEXA scan showed nearly a 17% improvement in bone density, putting me in the category of osteopenia.  I attribute this improvement in large part to daily walks of at least 2 miles, healthier diet (increase in calcium-rich foods), vitamin D supplementation and especially regularly following the BoneSmart postural practices and bone-strengthening exercises in the BoneSmart Pilates DVD workouts.

I was immediately struck by important differences between the BoneSmart Pilates DVD and my previously purchased DVDs:
1. Teresa is a licensed PT with years of experience, so I had confidence that the exercises were SAFE.  In fact, many of the exercises were those recommended by my PT.

2. Teresa is a very effective teacher.  Unlike my PT, Teresa clearly demonstrates common postural errors (unsafe positions), followed by detailed explanation of the proper postures.  When I attend a yoga class now, I know what exercises are not safe for those with osteoporosis and how to safely modify them.

3. The DVD is divided into short workouts, 2 or 3 of which are easily manageable to do on a daily basis.
  a. MAT exercises for core, hip & arm strength/vertebral bone building/flexibility
  b. STANDING counter workout for alignment, balance, contraction working hips, back & wrists
  c. RESISTANCE BAND workout to develop proper posture & strengthen back, core and shoulders (excellent for anyone who has suffered  frozen shoulder)
  d. HIP blaster (daily 5-minute essential workout)
  e. BONE DANCE workout incorporates the element of ""bone surprise"" to stimulate bone remodeling
  f. BONUS section that provides the best coaching I have ever seen on postural alignment that can be practiced throughout the day; seated exercises that provide an alternative to the MAT workout for those (like me) who suffer from vertigo; and a morning routine called ""rise and shine"" to safely awaken muscles and joints

4. Each DVD segment is preceded by a detailed tutorial, which can easily be skipped if you desire to do so and have mastered the concepts/safe positions.  After almost 3 years, I STILL prefer to go through both the tutorial and its section, as I find benefit from the methodical slower-paced tutorial as a warm-up for the actual routine.

5. The concepts of Alignment, Balance & Contraction (the ABCs explained in the DVD's introduction) are emphasized/reinforced throughout all workouts.

6. Those who purchase the DVD have access to a private support page!

7. The DVD production quality is superior:
  a. The background/environment is not cluttered (white background, participants wear similarly colored clothing, offering a relaxing, distraction-free visual experience)
  b. Positions that could be confusing are described verbally in detail and demonstrated in front, back and side views as needed. Description and modeling of common postural errors are clearly contrasted with correct postures. The images of a soup bowl, lantern and puppet strings to illustrate postural alignment are excellent.
  c. Workout participants vary in age from 40s to 80s and adaptive positions are described and demonstrated.
  d. Sound is excellent and verbal instructions are evenly paced and clearly enunciated.

For those concerned that the exercises can't be performed without the prop bundle, alternatives to the prop bundle are described in the DVD.  I used previously purchased resistance bands (one tied in a knot to simulate the ankle band), a rolled up towel for the mini-ball and a swiffer mop handle instead of a dowel.  That said, I recently treated myself to the prop bundle and it is definitely a step up!",1462320000,95,4124,5.228658536585366

5940172,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I exercise to improve my health.  I didn't realize how negatively I could impact my health by the type of exercises I do if I have any bone weakness.  Pilates short spine was a regular move I did that is completely contraindicated because of my bone density issues.  I can actually break the front of my vertebrae by loading my spine this way.  Shocked, I began to research available DVD's and pilates instructors to help me relearn movement.  Now that I am on the track, I find that there are resources out there.  However, this is the best in terms of explanations, clarity and production quality.  The props are of good quality.  The 1/2 tennis balls live under my desk.  My feet have never felt better.",1454630400,5,706,4.5396825396825395
5940173,5,B00ESKSRL2,Very informative and enjoyable.  I am so happy that someone has re-designed the pilates exercises with the safety of people with osteoporosis in mind.,1454544000,5,150,5.25
5940174,5,B00ESKSRL2,"It is not my intention to convince anyone they should buy this product.  I am just happy I bought it!  It was exactly what I needed to do when I learned that I was being diagnosed with severe osteoporosis at age 66.  Out of appreciation for this DVD and for Teresa's dedication, I am inspired to share my comments with others. The BoneSmart Pilates DVD is more than a really good investment in my own health.  It is a valuable and major part of my osteoporosis health care plan.  After only three months of practicing the Mat Workout, I feel myself regaining physical strength and grace that years of osteoarthritis and osteopenia have slowly undermined.  My self-image is improving along with my flexibility, balance, and muscle strength.  Aging is inevitable, but having a knowledgeable teacher like Teresa to show safe ways to move beyond what I thought was possible, gives me more hope for the future.
Now I am ready to try the Standing Counter Series Workout.  This DVD offers five different concise workouts - variety for the mind and the body.  In other DVD's I have used to do yoga or osteoporosis-preventing exercise, the time to complete the exercises has been about an hour.  An exercise program that takes an hour is much less flexible to use than this one.  The result is that I am using the BoneSmart Pilates workout consistently and getting more obvious results.",1454371200,6,1377,4.743697478991597
5940175,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I purchased this dvd after researching pilates classes in my area on the internet. I found them to be quite pricey, and somehow I came across Teresa's dvd and it seemed like the perfect thing for me, as I recently learned I had osteopenia in my spine. I am an ex-dancer now in my 50's and have been having a lot of joint and back pain creeping up on me over the years! I was impressed by her background as a physical therapist, and the great reviews! I also never realized that I could actually reverse bone loss. I watched the entire dvd first, and then began with the mat workout. I found the pacing to be very good, and Teresa gives great reminders throughout of how to work correctly, and how to work within one's own limits. I think this is very important. The dvd is very generous with different workout sections, so it can will keep me going with many options for a long time to come! With my dance and yoga background I thought it might not be challenging enough, but I must say, I felt all my muscles had worked hard! I highly recommend this dvd for any level of experience. Teresa is very welcoming and clear in her explanations and again, there are many so options presented. And speaking of options, although you can purchase the props, Teresa gives suggestions of items you might have at home that will serve instead. It's a great value all around!",1454198400,14,1361,4.404761904761905
5940176,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I am in my sixties and have recently been diagnosed with osteopenia. I have been looking for an exercise program which I could do at home to help with this condition, and hopefully avoid osteoporosis. In addition, I wanted to understand the principals of what is safe to do and what to avoid to have more awareness in my everyday life. Not just when Im exercising!

I have found what I was looking for with this DVD. It is packed with useful information based on Ms. Marchoks knowledge as a PT, as well as her many years of experience teaching Pilates. Ms. Marchoks manner is upbeat and engaging and the exercises are clearly presented. I like the fact that she shows real people doing these exercises and that there is a range of ages. The props add an interesting element and aren't too complicated. I especially liked working with the small ball as support for ab work. Although I could get them someplace like Target, I just ordered from the BoneSmart website. I also liked the practicality of this program  especially Rise and Shine! I have a lot of exercise DVDs on my shelf. This is the one I go to repeatedly. Its reassuring to know the exercises are safe and . . .  its fun!",1450051200,3,1183,4.467592592592593

5940178,1,B00ESKSRL2,"I question all the positive feedback but can certainly relate to the other one star review.  Although some of the exercises are okay, the dvd as a whole is repetitive, slow moving, and not very challenging or much fun for the extreme amount of time spent. It is no match for other osteoporosis conscious dvds and a bone building exercise class that I have appreciated and enjoyed.  I bought the bundle (with overpriced bands and balls) directly and had to pay a lot for return shipping and and a ""re-stocking fee"" not mentioned on the website.",1448323200,11,543,4.645833333333333

5940181,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I have to admit that I was a bit overwhelmed with this GREAT dvd, Pilates with Teresa. It made me very aware of the poor shape I was in.
Prior to this purchase, I suffered severe thigh pain which was emanating from my back.  I endured several steroid prescriptions producing limited relief and limiting my ability to stand or walk, especially on hard surfaces.  Sadly, sitting had become a good part of my day.
One part of this DVD where Teresa explains where Pilates is a process and not to be too hard on yourself really stuck with me and propelled me to keep practicing.  I am now able to keep up with the entire dvd, though it is still a bit challenging.  BUT the biggest surprise was that when I exercise with Pilates with Teresa daily, my thigh pain disappears.
I just spent the better part of the afternoon shopping at Costco with my husband without pain!!!!
Thank you, Teresa sooooo much for this FABULOUS DVD!!!
It is my hope that there will be a succession of DVDs from this knowledgeable physical therapist and Pilates instructor.

As a  64 year old woman with a recent osteoporosis diagnosis, I needed to work on both balance and strength, and this DVD helps me do that.  I learned a lot from Teresa's information about and modeling of safe movement and procedures for exercisers with osteoporosis. Her background as a Physical Therapist and a Pilates instructor is reassuring and shown by the many exercise modifications her students demonstrate. The DVD itself is easy to navigate, and you can go straight to the workout sections. The production values (camera work, set, sound) are great and I really enjoy her personable manner and motivational cueing. I grin every time I do the Bone Dance.

Everything I have watched in the DVD makes sense. There is so much information included. With osteoporosis/osteopenia you have to be careful of certain exercises and movements.

Teresa replied immediately to my e-mail and stated she was going to have it checked out and to send her the model number of the player.  I also told her that I would let her know if the DVD would work at home when back from vacation.  It did work on one player but not the other in our family room.  Teresa had found out that the original DVD I had would not work on older players.  She then sent me a fixed version which now works on both players.  Excellent customer service!

As far as the pilates workout, this DVD is wonderful.  Each exercise is explained in detail for all levels of fitness.  You learn so much about good posture and how to build bone strength.

Teresa explains all the moves and exercises very thoroughly; and also uses some of her students, of different ages, as models in order to show the options for different abilities and needs.  One can purchase some of the props that are used for the resistance exercises, but Teresa also shows you how to use household items in lieu of the ""official"" ones (e.g. A towel or broomstick).  I watched the entire DVD before starting, and I also was already working for a couple of private sessions with a physical therapist who is also  a certified Pilates instructor.  Soon I will be doing my workouts at home with the Bone Smart DVD, with only the occasional checkup with my therapist to make sure my body placement is correct.  Also, Teresa will soon be offering (or may already have it set up) a virtual way for people who are not near her studio to  work with or consult you about how YOU are actually doing the exercises.

I am so pleased to have come across Teresa's BoneSmart DVD.  My students are aging, as am I, and having a knowledgeable Physical Therapist discuss and show variations on the Pilates routines to facilitate people with Osteoporosis is a godsend.
The props she uses are wonderful.  The stretchy to keep the neck un-involved and the 6 inch inflatable ball as an aid in abdominal work with extension instead of flexion is brilliant.  I have already started using her suggestions for my students with spinal stinosis among other ""ailments"".  Thank you Teresa.

It is not difficult at all, will do about twice a week or so!",1395705600,3,117,3.5384615384615383
5940199,4,B00ESKSRL2,"I love this DVD and use it several times a week.  Teresa has a pleasant upbeat presentation, and is clear in demonstrating the exercises.  However, I would take exception to  her mat exercises, which include a twisting of the spine -- as my physician has told me that this is counterindicated for persons with osteopenia.  My personal solution has been to just skip this section and do the others, which are excellent, and fun.",1394496000,44,427,4.72972972972973
5940200,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I ordered BoneSmart Pilates on a Friday and received it on Monday morning. Better than that, this DVD is a real bone building gem. It includes detailed tutorials on how to do each exercise, with clear instructions on performing them safely. (The instructor is a physical therapist.) The routines are varied and fun. I purchased the prop bundle too from the instructors website [...]. It arrived quickly, with everything I need to get the full benefit  and enjoyment - from all the movements and routines on the DVD. Using the ankle band intensifies the work in my hips. Using the ball helps me support my head and increases the benefit to my core.",1394064000,8,647,4.725663716814159
5940201,5,B00ESKSRL2,"BoneSmart Pilates is a wonderful exercise DVD that addresses my osteoporosis concerns in an informative and engaging manner. Having had two falls which resulted in broken bones by age 65, it was clear that I needed to improve both my bone strength and balance.

The DVD's tutorials are excellent with easy to follow instructions and helpful demonstrations. Teresa carefully explains the do's and don'ts of exercising with osteoporosis along with why these guidelines are important. Rather than limit your Pilates, she simply changes the way you do certain things so that you can do the exercises safely. She also shows you how to incorporate these techniques into your everyday activities. After just a short time, I feel that my balance, alignment and core strength have improved.  Teresa is an inspiring teacher who makes the DVD's workouts fun. Afterwards, I am both refreshed and motivated. I would highly recommend BoneSmart Pilates for anyone concerned about osteoporosis.",1392076800,6,978,5.303225806451613

5940203,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I am 55 years old and was diagnosed with osteoporosis in my spine 8 years ago.  I enjoy exercise but was not finding exercises tailored specifically to the osteoporosis patients.  A month ago I was made aware of the BoneSmart Pilates DVD.  Finally, something for US by someone who truly understands the needs of those with osteoporosis!!  I got the DVD and the props and have enjoyed learning fun ways to protect my bones. I like that the exercises are first reviewed and explained before the workout, so you have a good idea of how to do them right off the bat.  The real people demonstrating the exercises is refreshing; I appreciate that!  The exercises are enjoyable and always make me feel wonderful afterwards.  I also like that there are alternatives to some of the moves; I have chronic bursitis and have limited range of motion in my shoulders.  Hopefully this will increase with these gentle, yet effective moves.  I would recommend this program to anyone with osteoporosis or who wants to keep their bones healthy.  I am going to spread to the word to my doctor as well.  Thank you Teresa!!!",1385078400,14,1102,4.6875
5940204,5,B00ESKSRL2,"This DVD is packed with excellent information that we should practice daily. It's nicely organized, entertaining, and the exercises feel so good! I recommend Teresa, and this DVD to anyone who wants to learn best practices for safer bone health. I've been working with Teresa in her private studio, which has helped me get stronger each week as I recover from some injuries. Each session is unique, motivating, and a ton of fun!",1384819200,5,428,4.876712328767123
5940205,5,B00ESKSRL2,"I have not been diagnosed with osteoporosis, but I am concerned with protecting my bones and aging gracefully.

The DVD includes 5 different workouts plus bonus material including a tennis ball foot massage, postural alignment coaching, and a five-minute rise and shine stretching program meant to be done in bed as you wake up.

I liked that the instructor uses real people as demonstrators.  The demonstrators range in age from a woman in her 40s to a gentleman in his 80s.  I found the 80-year-old guy especially inspiring--if he can do the workout then I should be able to!

The DVD includes almost 2  hours of content, but much of that time is devoted to tutorials for each of the workouts. I liked that the instructor gives you detailed instructions on how to do each exercise properly. She also has her demonstrators show common mistakes people make, so it is easier to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly.

According to the instructor, just five minutes of balance work a day has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of falls, and the video includes a balance series that is very do-able.

Each workout can be completed in just 5 - 15 minutes, so once you get the hang of the workouts you can easily squeeze them in over the course of your day. You can make the workouts more intense by increasing resistance and/or repetitions so you can customize it for any fitness level.

The workouts do use quite a few props, which the instructor sells on her web site. But I like that she gives you alternative options for some of the props--things you already have around your house. You will need a resistance band, miniball, and ankle resistance loop, but those items are widely available. For balance the instructor and demonstrators use a dowel rod. You could use your kitchen counter or a piece of furniture, or put together what the demonstrators are using by buying a couple of things at a home improvement store.

The tennis ball foot massage calls for a tennis ball cut in two halves. I have the professionally cut ball that is sold on PilateswithTeresa.com. It does provide an excellent massage for my aching feet.

In Summary both the tutorials and workouts are valuable tools to help anyone age gracefully. It also makes a great gift--I bought one for a friend who has osteopenia as a result of oncology treatments. I am very pleased with this purchase--$30 is a small price to pay to learn how to protect my bones and stay strong and vibrant into my 80s!",1382054400,38,2485,4.663615560640732
5940206,5,B00ESKSRL2,I routinely send my patients to Teresa for Pilates training because of her ability to blend a strong knowledge of the human body with a creativity for exercise.  Bone Smart Pilates blends Pilates exercise principles with current knowledge of osteoporosis fracture prevention.  I intend to recommend this DVD to all my older patients.,1380585600,7,333,5.264150943396227
8608951,5,B00ESKSRL2,"Would you like to feel younger and stronger?  Then this DVD is your golden ticket!  The exercises are safe for everyone and Teresa makes them fun to do.  Her expertise is invaluable and she inserts nuggets of wisdom throughout.  The TUTORIALS afford you critical pointers on breath, alignment, and safety so I strongly urge viewers to watch and review them because not following the regimen can result in less than desired or expected results.  The DVD is sequenced, first warming up and then working the muscles.  There is also a hierarchy to the DVDs and this is an excellent starting point as the other 2 are more advanced.  I have always exercised and enjoy an active lifestyle but knew I had to hone my routine based on recurring sciatica and age, soon to be a septuagenarian!

I have been practicing this DVD for 10 days and the results are impressive.  As a former Pilates teacher I was aware of the benefits of Pilates but also the risks since my body has been compromised with sciatica and osteopenia, I felt it necessary to find a regimen that would support those areas.  Teresa's expertise is unparalleled.  Although I purchased all 3 of her DVDs I am going to continue using this one until I feel equal strength on both sides of my body.

To challenge myself I increase the repetitions to build strength, insuring that when I am ready to begin BoneSmart Pilates Aging Strong Volume 1, my body will be strong enough while keeping it safe.

This DVD is divided into 4 segments with a dance bonus:
MAT WORK- neck, supine, side, and prone targeting back and core strengthening
STANDING COUNTER SERIES- mainly lower body strength with some upper body
RESISTANCE BAND- arms and upper back
HIP BLASTER- lower body and balance
DANCE- fun integration of techniques taught

Here is a list of my benefits:
1. Improved lower body strength so climbing stairs is no longer an issue. I can also get up from a
  low squat without assistance.
2. Improved posture and a stronger core
3. Improved breath with fewer asthmatic incidents
4. Improved balance, critical for preventing falls
5. Trimmed waist by 1"" and clothes fit better
6. Postponed taking osteoporosis medicine.  My DEXA scan revealed that my osteopenia
  worsened which catapulted me into action, prompting me to select this DVD series.  My
  physician was very impressed with Teresa's credentials and felt this would build bone strength
  along with calcium and vitamin D supplements. I am 1/2 point away from osteoporosis in my
  spine so I will be diligent in my practice to build bone mass by using resistance bands.

Although I own balls and bands I wanted her equipment.  Watching the DVD I mmediately noticed a difference in her ball.  Fully inflated, it has give, while I had to deflate mine which was firmer, so I didn't benefit from a full range of motion.  The fascia ball is a treat for the feet.  The bands are excellent so my older ones are squirreled away in various rooms and can be used frequently during the day.  When my upper back becomes tired from desk work, cooking, etc, I pull out a band and do the W's and the tension is released!  All items are portable and easily packed so they will go wherever my travels take me.

Thank you, Teresa.  You have provided a safe but powerful program, appropriate for everyone.",1513036800,6,3294,4.699300699300699
8608952,4,B00ESKSRL2,"I recently stumbled across this DVD at a used book sale and was curious enough to purchase it.  It is specifically designed to provide safe Pilates-based exercises for those who have osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.  I am not in either of those categories, but I am turning 50 in six months.  Although I am an experienced exerciser who works out on a daily basis--and also a certified yoga instructor--I am looking to continue to stay healthy as I get older.

This DVD is instructed by Teresa Maldonado Marchok, who is both a licensed physical therapist and a certified Pilates instructor.  She explains in her introduction that she has ensured that the works on this DVD do not include moves that are contraindicated for osteoporosis, such as excessive forward flexion (forward bending) and forward bending with a twisting motion.  Teresa also describes her ""ABCs"" of BoneSmart Pilates, which are Alignment, Balance, and Contraction.  Teresa includes exercisers in her workouts who range in age from 40s to their 80s, and they briefly introduce themselves at the start.  Finally, note that the Main Menu includes an Introduction to Props segment.  There are A LOT of props used in this DVD, including a Pilates mini-ball, two different resistance bands (a long band and a looped band), a dowel, and halved tennis balls.  Substitutions may be able to be made for some of these, but viewers will probably want to be aware ahead of time what is required.

The Main Menu for the DVD is quite detailed.  I will first items as they appear on the menu, then add my impressions of the various segments.

Bonus Content
*Tennis Ball Foot Massage

*Credits

As you can see, each of the main workouts is preceded by a tutorial which breaks down the moves.  Personally, I do not like this format.  I think that an experienced instructor should be able to provide form pointers within the workout itself, which Teresa doesn't really do.  Also, the Tutorials give the appearance that this DVD has much more content than is actually the case, as most of the routines are quite short.  I have broken them down in greater detail below, along with approximate times.

Pilates Mat Workout (28 minutes)--This routine uses the mini-ball and the resistance band; the dowel is optional.  Teresa moves slowly and methodically.  Many of the moves are familiar, such as pelvic tilts, bridges, single leg circles, and single leg stretch, although they are often performed in a modified way.  I could see this being beneficial for someone with limited mobility or other restrictions, but most people who have done Pilates before and/or who are otherwise healthy are likely to find it too easy.

Standing Counter Series Workout (5 minutes)--This short series is what I would call a ""barre"" routine; Teresa and her assistant are actually using a ballet barre for plie work and similar moves.

Pilates Resistance Band Workout (14 minutes)--This segment can be performed standing or seated in a chair using the resistance band.  It was focused on the upper body, with exercises designed to strengthen the postural muscles.  I liked it; I've done very similar things in my yoga classes, so it was nothing new or different to me.

Hip Blaster Workout (5 minutes)--Another very brief sequence, this time using the looped band around the ankles and the dowel for balance (you could also use a barre, counter, or wall).  It consists mainly of quick leg lifts to the front, side, and back interspersed with brief plies in-between.

Bone Balance Workout (3 minutes)--I didn't expect to like this at all.  It was actually kind of fun--but so short!  The looped band is used again here, as so rather than cardio, you get more of a hip workout as Teresa leads you through side-to-side and front steps.

BONUS
*Tennis Ball Foot Massage (1 minute)--Again, so short!  And who has half tennis balls?  I actually have full tennis/other balls, but Teresa uses the half for balance safety.  I suggest instead doing one foot at a time (she does both) with a round ball and holding on to something.
*Postural Alignment Coaching (4 minutes)--Nice, but nothing I did not know already; I teach this in my yoga classes.
*Seated Exercise (4 minutes)--Basically two versions of seated backbend in a chair using the mini-ball behind the back in two different positions.
*Rise and Shine (9 minutes)--A nice stretch sequence you can do in bed or any time; incorporates some of the moves from the Mat Workout.

In summary, this DVD is well-done for the intended audience, but may come across as too slow and plodding for others.  I am leaning to towards the latter, as the Mat Workout in particular--the longest segment on the DVD--seemed to drag to me.  Yet at the same time, I recognize that as as I get older, I might need more routines like the ones this DVD has to offer.  So, I will likely hold on to BoneSmart Pilates for now and see if it meets my needs in the near future.",1508630400,6,5290,4.914317925591883
8608953,5,B00ESKSRL2,This is a brilliant DVD for anyone with osteoporosis trying to work out what sort exercise to do. Having struggled with the difficulties of balancing weight bearing (good) and high impact (not necessarily so good) I was delighted to come across this DVD.  It is a master class in how to impart information and inspire confidence.  The exercises are clearly explained and the right and wrong way of doing them shown.  Teresa's expertise inspires confidence that they can be safely and efficiently performed in order to bring about that all important improvement in bone density.  I would not be without it.  I was very pleased to learn that Teresa has recently produced two new DVD's but disappointed to find out that they are not yet available through Amazon here in the UK.,1502236800,,774,4.833333333333333
8608954,4,B00ESKSRL2,Great tutorials and exercises.  I like the options for different levels of ability.  I just started doing these exercises so I will see in about 8 months when I repeat my dexa scan if they are making a difference in my numbers (diagnosed with osteoporosis/osteopenia).

8608958,4,B00ESKSRL2,"I was borderline osteoporosis in 2010 (T-score -2.5). After reading online that osteoporosis and osteopenia can be reversed, I changed my diet and started working out eight months ago. I used Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout and Teresa Maldonado Marchok's BoneSmart Pilates DVDs. My exercise regimen also included strength training workouts such as lunges, planks, lateral pulldown, stair stepper machine, push-ups, superman exercise, mountain climbers, lateral walk with elastic band, balancing exercises and a few others from hep2go.com website. My latest DEXA scan two weeks ago showed tremendous improvement. This is very encouraging. I was not on any medication except Calcium Citrate and Vitamin D. Another bonus of these exercises is that they give you a lean, toned and shapely body. Very satisfied.",1481587200,14,829,5.587301587301587
