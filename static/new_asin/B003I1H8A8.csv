I bought this mainly because I am a Ben Cross fan, but this whole cast got my attention and now I want the others in this collection. Even if the other viewer bought it believing it was something else, believe me it took me a lot of time and research to find this set because Ben's work is pretty damned hard to find over here in the U.S.

This entire cast worked very well together and I judge what I watch the way I judge a book I read.  These characters brought out their character's emotions and traits well--PERIOD. The production, directing, editing and sound rocked...The fact that the other viewer mistakenly bought this should in no way reflect negatively on what is portrayed in this set. If you don't have this, get it.",1322179200,5,802,4.405405405405405
