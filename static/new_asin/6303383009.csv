645304,4,6303383009,"""So Proudly We Hail"" was made in 1943 and because I'm far too young I can only wonder what was the public's reaction to WW2 at this point in time. If Americans were starting to lose patience with the war then this movie could really lift your spirits and make you feel proud about what the men AND women were doing over seas. If people were patient with the war then it serves as a reminder for the hard work that lies ahead and how we SHOULD NOT become impatient. Either way you could say ""So Proudly We Hail"" is a piece of American propaganda (And I don't mean that as in insult) in the same vein as a Frank Capra film. But because of this some people may disregard it. I'm hear to write to you and tell you ""So Proudly We Hail"" is really a very entertaining emotion picture. What makes all the more amazing for me is to consider that Mark Sandrich directed it! I've always thought of Sandrich as a director of musicals. He directed several films with Fred Astair and Giner Rogers: ""Carefree"" and ""Top Hat"" and also films without Ginger Rogers like ""Holiday Inn"". He also directed two Bert Wheeler\Robert Woolsey comedies: ""Hips, Hips, Hooray"" and ""Cockeyed Cavaliers"". I never would have guessed he would have been capable of directing a movie with the scope of this one.

 ""So Proudly We Hail"" is based on a true story about eight nurses and their contribution to the war. The has an incredible cast including Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard (Both giving perhaps their best performances) and Veronica Lake (Also doing amazing work).

 At times the movie made me think of ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Since You Went Away"" (Also with Colbert). It's one of those great wartime movies. I strongly recommend if anyone gets the chance to see this movie they take advantage of it. It's well worth your time.

 Bottom-line: One of the great WW2 movies comparable to ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Since You Went Away"". Has great battle scenes and some very moving performances. I don't think I've ever seen Colbert and Goddard better.",1114819200,25,2014,4.611731843575419
645305,5,6303383009,"If you like movies about World War Two, you have to watch So Proudly We Hail. Made during the war, it captures the Can-Do spirit of solidarity in the face of many early set-backs for America in the early days of the war. Nurse Olivia Darcy, played by Veronica Lake, is determined to make the Japanese pay for what they did to her fiance at Pearl Harbor. How she evens the score and saves her fellow nurses will shock you! The romance between Lieutenants Summers (Steve Reeves) and Lt. Davidson (Claudette Colbert) is your standard war time love story.  An enjoyable film with a good mix of action, humor and pathos.",1101772800,4,615,4.54054054054054

It has everything that a good movie needs...plenty of action, romance and even humor.  The  ladies play very convincing roles as the nurses, with the exception of  Veronica Lake, whose acting leaves a little to be desired.

Battle scenes were surprisingly  realistic:  suggestive without being graphic.  I gained an even greater  appreciation for the sacrifices made by those in the armed forces during  WWII, both men and women.

645387,5,6303383009,"I love this movie, and have been watching it for years. I get it out once a year now and make all the kids in the family old enough to watch, sit down and see it. Whether they've seen it with me before or not. It was remarkably well made and shows a point of view not often depicted in war time movies. But it is a position my family will at least understand very well, because my mother was a nurse in the Air Force and was several times put on stand by to go over during the Gulf War. Thank goodness she never did, but thanks to this movie I can show my family some idea of what wars are like for nurses. Because many people are under the impression that nurses are now and have never been in harms way, etc. And the world need to know what they did and that they sacrificed as much as the soldiers that were sent over during any war.
So I'm very, very grateful for this movie having been made, and in my opinion it is one of the best ever made, including international films.
I wish it had won the Oscar that year, it definitely deserved it more.
Thank you to everyone to had a hand in making it, Even generations later it's important for the world to see all aspects of war, not just the fighting.",1488499200,,1201,4.050420168067227

Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake, and Paulette Goddard were grand stars of their day and shine in this work, based off of the true stories of those that made it home. I remember watching it on Turner Classic Movies when I was in high school, and it is just as glorious now as it was then.

Do yourself a favor. If you are at all enamored with the history and stories of those who served, or those who star in this film, watch it. It's some of their finest work.",1487808000,2,635,4.521739130434782

Especially today after finding out what lies caused the wars! And who caused the wars!! Just think it was all for monitory purposes for the elites to gain! The lives of men and women of our country a other countries fought for what they thought was needed, when in fact it was all false flags! Just think of the people we lost to this nonsense of gaining power and money to a small group of selfish devils!!!! When I watch this movie I cry because of the lost of life and patriotism these Americans had! And they thought they were fighting for a cause, but it wasn't what the real agenda was! God bless every one that fought, because in their hearts it was real to them!!!

Claudette, Veronica, Paulette and George and all the other actors and actresses for the reality of this film! May God rest their souls!!!! And may the people that caused the wars to be, may they pay highly for the lies that caused the deaths of many brave military Doctors, Nurses, civilians and brave soldiers of our country!

In the 21st Century it is so important to remember how many US servicemen and women were sacrificed at a time when the United States' back was against the wall. Many lost their lives, or suffered in POW camps under the treachery and cruelty of the Japanese Imperial Army.

645711,5,6303383009,"This film, based on real events, tells about the battles of Luzon, Bataan and Corregidor (8 December 1941 - 6 May 1942), in which, even if they fought bravely, Americans and their Filipino allies were defeated by Japanese, with a heavy loss of life. With Japanese Empire on offensive in all Pacific and with Washington being unable to efficiently assist, relieve or evacuate the defenders of Philippines, those months were certainly the darkest page in all history of American armed forces.

What happened after those battles was even worse, as the Japanese forced Filipino and American prisoners, exhausted and malnourished, to march at the double to the prisoner assembly area , before packing them tightly in trains and bringing them to POW camp. During the march, all those who couldn't walk fast enough were murdered - and the conditions in the trains were such, that more prisoners died from suffocation. In all, on a distance of barely 128 kilometres in all, no less than 2500 Filipino and 500 Americans died or were murdered... Even if this ""Bataan death march"" is NOT shown, the knowledge that it will unavoidably happen, permeates this whole film...

Made in 1943, soon after those events occurred, the film shows very well the desperate and dark mood of tragic days of defeat and death. It is somehow made even better by its unique point of view offered, as the main characters are those American soldiers, who shared all the deadly dangers with the combatants, but who were saving lives, rather than taking them - US military nurses, who earned for their courage and devotion the name of ""Angels of Bataan"".

For the needs of this war time production, Hollywood mustered three of its first league top actresses and half a dozen of lesser starlets.

Claudette Colbert plays in this film the main character, Lt. Janet Davidson, a tough, intelligent, serious, no-nonsense middle-aged woman, who is a natural born leader and an authority figure for younger nurses, when in the same time meeting, for the first time in her life, a true love in the middle of the hell...

Paulette Goddard plays magnificently a younger, prettier, sexy, cheerful and flirtatious nurse, Lt. Joan O'Doul - and her performance brought her a nomination for the Oscar of Best Supporting Actress (she ultimately didn't get it).

Veronica Lake, who although barely 21 years old, was in 1943 one of the main sex-symbols in Hollywood (especially after her main role in 1942 ""I married a witch""), plays here one of the youngest nurses, Lt. Olivia D'Arcy, a great beauty, but who is an emotional wreck since her fiance was killed in first days of war... Her time screen is more limited than that of two other main characters, but she steals every scene in which she appears - and her FINAL scene in this film SHOCKED America in 1943 and still packs today an ENORMOUS punch!

Amongst other actresses, it is worth to mention the beautiful Barbara Britton, who plays Lt. Rosemary Larson and who later appeared in a lot of westerns, as well as Lorna Grey, a very pretty girl, who plays Lt. Tony Dacolli. In her career Lorna Grey played mostly comic characters or villain vixens - and after retiring from acting, she is still alive and well today in 2013, at the greatly respectable age of 95...

This being a war time production, it has some necessary flaws of this kind of films, like occasionally very heavy clubbing with patriotic message - even the title is taken from ""Star-Spangled Banner"". But as director took great care to not overdo it, it doesn't hurt this film much.

The desperate defence of Bataan against a stronger and relentless enemy, as well as the grim atmosphere of life in crowded, claustrophobic tunnels of besieged fortress at Corregidor, are very well shown. The film shows in many occasions the courage of doctors and nurses, who sometimes operated LITERALLY under bombs and bullets, as well as the sufferings of wounded and sick soldiers and civilians, especially when medical supplies began to miss...

So bottom line, I liked this film a lot and I believe it is one of the more successful ""morale raisers"" made by Hollywood between 1941 and 1945. Warmly recommended!",1371772800,,4168,4.857746478873239

645820,4,6303383009,"This was one of several pretty good films made during the early years of World War II, when the outcome was still far from being decided.  It involved the Bataan-Corregidor era, focusing on a group of Army nurses in the middle of the fray.  As usual, the producers had to ham it up with a love story, but fortunately that didn't detract too much, leaving a high quality movie at the end.  Claudette Colbert and Paulette Goddard did fine acting jobs.

There was one rather suspenseful scene where the nurses were about to be accosted by a Jap patrol, with realism being cast aside a bit.  First, Claudette threw a hand grenade as if she were tossing a tennis ball.  A few minutes later, Veronica Lake went strolling in the direction of the enemy, calmly unpinning another grenade hidden inside her blouse, then blowing both herself and the Nips to kingdom come.

In principle, the scene made sense.  However, anyone who has ever dealt with hand grenades will realize that the pins take a healthy pull to be removed and the throwing process has to be more like a shot put endeavor than a mere toss.",1326758400,,1096,4.5561224489795915

Aunt Dot never remarried but continued her career as a nurse in civilian life, retiring in her late sixties.

The emotion in the scene is totally palpable and real. Her final scene is absolutely riveting and heart-breaking to watch. If this movie were to be remade, Kristanna Loken would be the PERFECT choice to play D'Arcy; though a remake wouldn't be a good idea, given Hollywood's inexplicable tendency to put language, sex and violence into almost every remake these days. Like ""Twelve O'Clock High,"" this powerful movie conveyed the horrors of war without resorting to graphic violence or vuulgar language (which was not only prohibited by the Hollywood Production Code, but also unneccessary). My only complaint is that it didn't show what happened to the ex-football player who says that nothing ever happens to him, and the film could have been longer by 5-10 minutes. Highly recommended.

It didn't hurt watching Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard and Vernoica Lake, however. All of them looked very pretty. Lake was missing her peek-a-boo long blonde hair but probably - at least facially - looked better than I've ever seen her. Her role was the most interesting.

But for 126 minute-film, as a male looking for an action film, I would have liked to see a bit less courtship scenes, which included some corny dialog. I realize they needed to break up the action scenes and give something for the females to watch, but they often made no sense. For example, near the end Colbert marries George Reeves (yes, Superman) even though she admits she knows almost nothing about the man!.

645865,5,6303383009,"""We must have faith. We will fight to the death to make those tender and sentimental beliefs, like Christmas, a reality forever."" -- The chaplain in a quiet and solemn moment on a ship bound for Bataan, nurses gathered around the Christmas tree.

This superb wartime drama deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Mrs. Miniver. Those who dismiss it offhand as propaganda would do well to view it first and try not being moved. Based on the stories of eight real nurses who had survived Bataan and Corregidor, and were still serving their country, it offers a very real look at the dark early days of WWII, when men and women were doing little more than buy America time to regroup and rearm after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Director Mark Sandrich, remembered more today for his wonderful films with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, makes this long yet tender tribute to those nurses and soldiers a film every American should see.

Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard, and Veronica Lake make you forget about their glamour a few moments into the film as the viewer is swept up in their plight. Written by Allan Scott, and photographed by Charles Lang, with a fabulous score by Miklos Rosza as accompaniment, all three leads shine in various times throughout the film. Lake owns the first portion of the film, Goddard the middle, and Colbert the end. Colbert is the anchor, however, becoming more accessible as the film goes on. George Reeves, as Colbert's sweetheart, and Sonny Tufts especially, as Goddard's, make this film charming and heartbreaking, elevating it beyond Hollywood's take on WWII nurses.

As the film opens, the nurses are returning home from their harrowing tours in Bataan and Corregidor. But something traumatic has silenced their leader, Lt. Janet (Davy) Davidson,  who wanted to stay behind and now will not speak. The doctor believes the only way to help her is to know in full the background of what happened to them. So as painful as it is to talk about, Joan O'Doul (Goddard) and the other girls relate their story. What follows is a tender and moving tragedy of many little tragedies suffered by Americans during those early days after we were attacked. In 1943, it was a wonderfully dramatic film which helped our country understand just what we were fighting for and the sacrifice the free world was making towards that end. Viewed today, it is no less a moving document of a remarkable time in the world's history.

Davy and Janet find themselves on a ship in the middle of the Pacific awaiting orders after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Veronica Lake joins the nurses in the shaky and uncertain future before them. Olivia (Lake) will not make friends or socialize with the other nurses. Only after they discover they are heading to Bataan, a place none have ever heard of, does Davy finally reach inside and pull out of her the heartbreaking reason she must go with them. Lake has one of her finest moments on film here, and will have another when the nurses must escape from the oncoming Japanese soldiers or suffer the fate of those women at Nanking. It is the pivotal dramatic moment in the film, changing the film's tone and letting us know that this is a serious film about war and sacrifice.

The human element is never lost amidst the bombings and makeshift hospitals, as letters from home, wartime romance, and the impending chance they may themselves not survive are handled well by Sandrich. Colbert is excellent throughout as their solid leader trying not to fall in love with a soldier (George Reeves) taken with her, but not succeeding. It will lay more at her doorstep until one more retreat without knowing for sure he is okay will overwhelm her. It is Goddard's Joan who lights up the screen, however, changing from the frivolous and flirtatious to reveal a depth brought out by war and circumstance. Her unexpected romantic attachment to a sweet but none too bright soldier named Kansas has both charm and a sense of realism. Sonny Tufts excels in the role of Kansas and left an impression on moviegoers.

Little moments of normalcy and fun, such as Joan's black evening dress she takes or wears everywhere, even underneath the kaki, and Davy's Tojo, the tiny monkey given her by John, who becomes their mascot, are offset by deflating war news of convoys they were counting on for relief being sunk, and constant bombings of the hopitals during the early days of the war. In this way, it is a very real picture of what happened, with war interrupting plans and lives, and taking people in directions they could not have foreseen. Mary Servoss gives a fine performance also as the Captain who suffers a loss greater than any should ever have to bear. Barbara Britton and Walter Abel round out a fine cast.

Those who either dismiss this film without seeing it first, or give up on it after the first half hour, are truly missing out on one of the most moving tributes to those who served their country during those dark early days of WWII ever filmed. Some gave all. A touching and fabulous film not to be missed.",1230422400,3,5065,4.715254237288136

The three principles, Claudette, Paulette, and Veronica play off each other very nicely. They weren't just pretty faces, that's for sure!

Some things about the film may make today's viewers flinch, namely the act of calling Japanese people, ""Japs."" However, it is important to consider the point of view of those involved and of the initial audience. My paternal grandfather was a WWII vet, and until the day he died he always called Japanese people by that derogatory term. I don't like the practice, but I am a product of my time.  While ""So Proudly We Hail"" and other films of the era are products of their time as well--and what isn't, even things that are timeless, like ""The Wizard of Oz""--it does not detract from the picture as a whole.",1217635200,2,1053,4.748633879781421

Am so pleased to be able to watch it again. It is a good story based on the accounts of nurses returning from Bataan at the start of World War II.

World War II in the Philippines offers an array of stories to be told and retold and this one is a welcome addition to the list (Bataan, Back to Bataan, They Were Expendable, Air Force, The Great Raid.) Having visited Manila, Bataan and Corregidor in the Philippines and having many Filipino friends my interest in these stories is admittedly personal, but this film transcends my preferences as a rare glimps at war through the eyes of women--American nurses.

The retreat to Bataan, the fall of Manila and the horrors of Corregidor are well represented in the story lines and with excellent special effects (in the context of the early 1940's.)  Issues of humanity in the face of inhuman conduct are touched on effectively as one nurse learns that hatred of the enemy is not a necessary part of the job they have to do.

George Reeves is the leading man as Lt. John Summer and you  realize that this movie has far too many Lieutenants. He and Lt. Janet fall in love.

It is December 7, 1941 & suddenly they can't go there. Stunned, the convoy wanders around a bit, gets attacked by the enemy & Christmas is spent at sea. They finally get orders & proceeded to Bataan, in the Philippines. The Battling Bastards of Bataan become the battling orphans in this movie. The nurses serve with great distinction & courage under battlefield conditions. Lots of special effects, as the hospital, ships & various vehicles are blown up. Janet & John are hot to consummate so they get married just before he is sent out on a mission behind enemy lines. Janet & the other nurses are evacuated before he returns. The movie is fine but it's preachy. Our cause is righteous, the enemy is brutal & God is on our side was hammered home every 15 minutes or so in case the audience forgot that we were at war.

645934,5,6303383009,"If they are bringing THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY to DVD finally, then maybe it's time to unravel the complications surrounding this film and feature it on DVD.  SO PROUDLY WE HAIL is one of the greatest of all war movies, and because it is told from a woman's point of view (so to speak, it still had a male director in the person of Mark Sandrich) it is sometimes ridiculed and derided, usually by armchair critics who should walk a mile in a nurse's shoes before daring to denigrate her bravery under fire.

Claudette Colbert plays Janet Davidson.  An unusual choice for a nurse, Colbert eschews most of her usual glamor (except for the San Francisco embarkation) and really gives herself to the part.  Colbert is often good when she has to play against strong women, and here Sandrich surrounds her with a gallery of independent types, the way Francois Ozon made Catherine Deneueve shine in the recent 8 1/2 WOMEN.  Janet is a born leader even though she can only be photographed on one side of her face, which somewhat limits her utilitarian duty during battle scenes.  Even covered with grime and jungle grease, Colbert still can turn heads, and when she meets George Reeves, the sparks ignite, hot enough to burn Corregidor down to the ground.

Veronica Lake plays up her dark side playing Lieutenant D'Arcy, a time bomb just waiting to explode.  Often seen as soignee and bewitching, with that cute fringe of hair playing peekaboo with her eyes, Lake here is going for a Cornell Woolrich-style vengeance against the Japanese.  If Tarantino had made KILL BILL in the 1940s Lake would have beat Uma Thurman in the role easily.  She's hotter than a pistol and she's Ms. 45.

Paulette Goddard has, I think, the most challenging role and I agree with other reviewers who say this is Goddard's best part.  While Colbert and Lake really just occupy the same acting space throughout the movie, Goddard's character has to change, so that viewers watch her mature from a fly by night flapper with only men on her mind, to a woman with a heart who lives to help others, not just impress them with her oomph.  It's harder than it looks to walk that line, but Goddard pulls it off without a whimper.  Often cast as the sexpot pure and simple, or the gold-digging mantrap she apparently was in real life, Goddard is entirely persuasive in her role, and like Lake, she's a natural at action scenes.  I want her to be my nurse.  Her romance with ""Kansas"" is kind of cute too.

All in all, an underrated movie with the kind of plot that screws in deeper and deeper, unbearably tight, like DAS BOOT, except set in the Pacific.",1118707200,53,2611,4.592672413793103
