8648130,4,B00J4OI0VE,"The rating is mostly because I love Escher Holloway, but the plot is good, the acting is good, and it's a cool period movie",1418688000,,123,4.166666666666667
8648131,3,B00J4OI0VE,"Got the movie because Eric Roberts was in it, but was impressed by the acting job of Escher Holloway in the film.  A slow paced crime drama taking place in 1959 in New York.  A low level street gang break into a apartment with the intent of stealing a gun they believe was in a drawer.  Instead they find it is a real gangster's apartment and they steal $10,000 that is on a table there.  Not the best idea considered it belonged to ruthless Casket Mike (Eric Roberts) a killer and leader of the local syndicate.  When they have to flee, one of the kids on the run hides the money and then tries to do the right thing by helping a young girl being harassed by another carload of young toughs.  He does fare well and is beaten badly.  The girl takes him home and heals him.  The girl, the daughter of another gangster who has been hiding out for years after being shot and left for dead by Casket Mike, heals his wounds and love ensues.  If you like this kind of gritty drama you will enjoy this.",1417910400,,995,4.1947368421052635
