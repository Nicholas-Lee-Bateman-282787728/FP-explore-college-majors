7315313,5,B010ONY5U8,"Amazing French film with English subtitles. It about a young girl taken to a school for deaf children. The girl in the movie is both deaf and blind. This school is run by nuns. Mostly not a religious film, with a few religious themes/views. Based on a true story in 1770's; I believe. Way before Helen Keller. Set in France.",1479600000,,324,4.416666666666667

Did the sister/teacher really leave and not explain to the child she was sick?  Doesnt seem very Christian for a nun!",1455580800,,376,4.455882352941177

7315339,5,B010ONY5U8,"This is a true love story....not in the sappy way of Ryan ONeal and Ally McGraw...but something far more fundamental.  It's truly awe inspiring to see the length one young nun went to help a young girl out of the prison of her darkness.  It does remind one of the story of Helen Keller but that doesn't diminish its power.  Isabel Carre is luminous as the idealistic self sacrificing nun.  The film is shot in the French countryside, a perfect setting for this kind of  quiet, beautiful tale.  Highly recommended.",1451001600,3,513,4.644444444444445
7315340,5,B010ONY5U8,I just finished watching this on Netflix and now plan on buying it!  This incredible true story has so much depth in only a way the French could tell.  It is so powerful and moving I couldn't stop the tears from flowing. Please watch this!,1450742400,2,239,4.288888888888889

7315343,5,B010ONY5U8,"A touching, beautifully rendered account of the story of Marie Huertin, a deaf and blind girl who lived in France, and was taught sign language by a sister at a convent where deaf children were raised by nuns.  Isabelle Carre is wonderful as Sister Marguerite, and Ariana Rivoire, a deaf actress in real life, is a true discovery as Marie.",1447632000,3,339,4.65
7315344,5,B010ONY5U8,"Writer (with Phillipe Blasband) and Director Jean-Pierre Amris has created a stunning film that speaks about people born with disabilities and how in the case of this character those people often become significant contributors to our understanding of humanity at its most sensitive. Based on a true story the film is radiant in both the acting and the extraordinary setting in which the story is presented.

The synopsis outlines the message very succinctly: At the turn of the 19th century, a humble artisan and his wife have a daughter, Marie (Ariana Rivoire), who is born deaf and blind and unable to communicate with the world around her. Desperate to find a connection to their daughter and avoid sending her to an asylum, the Heurtins (Gilles Treton and Laure Duthilleul) send fourteen-year-old Marie to the Larnay Institute in central France, where an order of Catholic nuns manage a school for deaf girls. There, the idealistic Sister Marguerite (Isabelle Carr in a luminous performance) sees in Marie a unique potential, and despite her Mother Superior's skepticism, vows to bring the wild young thing out of the darkness into which she was born. The film recounts the courageous journey of a young nun and the lives she would change forever, confronting failures and discouragement with joyous faith and love.

A sensitive film, rich in message and in visual realization, this is one of those quiet, uplifting films  especially made for those who tire of the deluge of killing/action/crash/apocalyptic/undead films that assault our senses. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, November 15",1447372800,4,1594,5.21875

7315348,5,B010ONY5U8,This is a lovely and moving true story and one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  It demonstrates how one person's determination can literally change everything for another human being and bring great love and meaning to their own life at the same time.  Get out the tissue box for this wonderful film.,1445472000,5,311,4.43859649122807

7315350,5,B010ONY5U8,"In late-19th-century France, Marie (Ariana Rivoire), an artisan's daughter born without the ability to see or hear, is sent to a convent devoted to the education of deaf children.  Never able to express herself or communicate with others in any productive way, she is volatile bordering on dangerous and only responds to the most basic sensory input.  Ailing, but highly committed Sister Marguerite (Isabelle Carr&eacute;) agrees to try to teach her to sign and become part of society.

Though based on a true story, there is no denying Marie's Story bears a significant resemblance to the oft-dramatized story of Helen Keller, a deaf and blind child who became a left-wing activist and lecturer as an adult, and her teacher, Anne Sullivan.  It could also be compared to another fact-derived French film:  The Wild Child, in which legendary New Wave director Franois Truffaut cast himself as an physician treating an undomesticated adolescent who grew up alone in the forest.  But even if Marie's Story is ""unoriginal,"" it more than distinguishes itself with strong acting (Rivoire is revelatory and truly gives herself over to the role in body and soul), as well as ravishing cinematography of the French countryside and a genuine respect for the arduous and profound process of educating the disabled.  And, to be honest, it is hard not to be drawn into and moved by this type of story, at least in my opinion.",1439337600,13,1412,4.982978723404256

8722870,5,B010ONY5U8,"I can't say enough good things about Marie's Story.  I've shown this film to all my high school students of French since its release on DVD, and they've all been very moved by the story line.  Some good lessons for young people to learn here, the most important I'd say being empathy.",1520121600,,284,4.4423076923076925
