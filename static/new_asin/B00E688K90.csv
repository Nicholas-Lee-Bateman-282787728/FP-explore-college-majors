5892279,3,B00E688K90,I like saint seiya quit a bit but like the other reviews say the subtitling is crappy.,1408838400,6,86,4.117647058823529
5892280,2,B00E688K90,"As a Seiya fan I'm very disappointed that New Video Group published a very low quality release because we didn't deserve this for $90 (almost $100 for god's sakes)!

Positive aspects:
+ This comes packaged in a slipcover, with two DVD cases and 11 discs.
+ It utilises the original Saint Seiya logo and Japanese credits.

Negative aspects:
- The English subs are very rough, badly timed and not good at all, you could say they're just slightly better than a bootleg release which is true.
- Opening and ending songs aren't subtitled.
- Next Episode Previews weren't subtitled either, except for Episode 2 (Burn! Meteor Punch of Pegasus)
- Picture quality isn't remastered as we've seen on other releases.
- Audio quality isn't very good but in this regard this wasn't New Video Group's issue, it's to do with Toei Animation they threw away the tapes of it away.
- There's no extras at all (no clean OP/ED).

All in all just make sure to avoid this like the plague because it's an absolutely atrocious release which should not be bought by anyone, regardless that it's Saint Seiya its fans should not lower their standards because of it.

P.S.: Saint Seiya the original series is receiving an HD treatment on Blu-ray in Japan so hopefully we'll see some other more capable and professional company (Discotek, Viz Media or FUNimation) take care of it than the crappy NVG.",1397865600,18,1369,4.739495798319328
5892281,4,B00E688K90,"The box is cheap, like a $20 Adam Sandler movie-cheap. No special features, nothing inside but the discs with the episodes printed on the face of the discs themselves. Already not worth $100.

Anyway, I randomly threw a disc into my player and picked Episode 27. The lag started out pretty bad, about a paragraph of dialogue behind, but it fairly quickly picked up and was only lagging behind about two or three words. The subbing quality is a bit lazy. An American fansub group could have done better, if they were actual fans of the series. FAR better than the Hong Kong bootleg subs. Most of the mistakes I caught in the few minutes I watched the episode was more of a ""I would have translated this into a different term"" than anything really bad, at least what my limited knowledge of the language tells me. Of course, you'd need someone who speaks the language fluently to really understand if the subs are fairly accurate or not. Video/audio quality is lower than the remastered DVDs released a few years back, but still pretty good.

This does not feel like Cinedigm actually translated them. It feels like they cleaned up someone else's work and slapped their name and a $100 pricetag on it. I paid $70 through Amazon, having been inpatient for the release and getting 2 day shipping.(These technically arrived on Monday, but I was out of town until midnight last night). I would have returned it at over $100. I'm half-tempted to return them at $70 and wait for a used copy on eBay to appear. $50 is probably right on the money. For the ERSP Toei(Because I know Toei and I know those greedy bastards are behind the price, it's why this is the first time we got official subs, and why we may never get the full of the original Sailor Moon anime released here, subbed) is shoving on this, I would expect all four anime arcs. $50 is good for half the series though.

So yeah, I was inpatient and waited too long. I have never returned anything through Amazon, it's probably more trouble than it's worth to do that(They didn't even give me a return shipping label, how cheap is that? No physical receipt of my order either, just threw it in a manila envelope and slapped a label on it). $70 is a bit too much, $100? To hell with that. If you bought this at full price, you're probably gonna return it and wait for a markdown or used copies.

It's getting four stars simply because we may never get the rest of the series, and probably won't get a better release.",1397692800,10,2467,4.475555555555555
5892282,3,B00E688K90,"I received my set today and I can say I'm disappointed. The translation is not good, but I have seen worse. Also, if you're looking for the English dub its no where to be found. Subs only people. That wouldn't be a problem if the subs didn't suck. It's tolerable but expect to see grammatical and punctuation errors, moments of poor translation, and names being mixed around (especially Grand Pope Ares).

If I had spent the original price of $90, I would be enraged. I'm still not happy paying the $55 but I love this series.

If you can get past the errors in the subs, you'll be in for a great fighting anime.

I hope Asgard, Poseidon, and Hades are released as well, hopefully with better subtitles.",1396915200,5,703,4.4765625
5892283,5,B00E688K90,I hope that these are all the episodes to I have volumes 1-12 and they stopped and they are the English dubbed that came out about 7-8 years ago.,1395705600,,145,4.0344827586206895
5892284,1,B00E688K90,"yes! just pre ordered mine. i cant wait till it gets here. i am hoping this version will have all the episodes, cut, uncensored, unrated. bonus footages and absolutely 5.1 surround sound. hopefully they remastered it too like they did to the movies ""Goddess Eris, Heated Battle of gods, The Legend of the Crimson Youth and the Holy Final Battle of Warriors"" awsome i am amused how saint seiya is growing once again in north america! Thank you so Much! i will be coming back to give out my review once i get! Pegasus Ryuseikenn!!",1395014400,2,528,4.568421052631579
5892285,5,B00E688K90,I loved watching tv on Cartoonnetwork until they took it off and then I caught up with the rest on youtube but now I can rewatch the series on dvd in one box set. I just hope that it cotains the whole arc dubbed and I hope that New Video could get a dubbing company to finish the dubbing the rest of the series in english.,1388707200,3,322,3.893939393939394
