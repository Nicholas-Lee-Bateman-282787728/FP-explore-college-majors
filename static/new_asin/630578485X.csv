With a title that includes ""most dangerous"" I  expected more of the same, but the first segment with tiger sharks was  downright boring.  Lots of the same shots, lots of exclamations of wonder,  but no real information - for example what were all the smaller fish  swimming with the sharks?  Baby sharks?  Lamprey?  The video does improve  as it goes along, but with all the ""dangerous"" bits isolated  Steve seems a bit of a fool and quite the pest to bother the poor animals!  My twelve-year-old friend was not enthralled either, so I'd say skip this  one and try one of the others.",962668800,11,738,4.569230769230769

Its got some of the bits from indonesia when 2 komodo dragons  chased him down, about a zillion snake bites ( includeing hte infamous  timber ratter day! )< when terri started to fall off the cliff, and tons  more. TOTALLY worht buying, even ifyorue not a fan per se its worth the  watch.",954374400,16,442,4.226190476190476
