8512660,1,B0079C7HNK,Episodes are well done and enjoyable. Unfortunately this is a repackaging of Series 2 previously released.,1416182400,,106,5.6875
8512661,5,B0079C7HNK,"I am a big fan of Lynda La Plant`s TV writing.  I don`t enjoy her books but when it comes to TV she has few equals.

Her characters are incredibly real.  Ordinary,eccentric,and with villains of incredible cruelty.  I like the fact that so much research has gone into her writing. It always has a ring of truth.

This particular story is the third of four.  The main characters are in all of them. The films are true ensemble pieces where we know about their lives and problems.  However, they still work and produce results, despite the great pressures that always seem to come from the higher police echelon and of course, the ever intrusive press..

The standard is enormously high and all the actors rise to the occasion.  I don`t feel that there is a weak link anywhere, and though the series was made some years ago, nothing has dated.

I thoroughly recommend the whole series to crime buffs.  I`m sure they won`t be disappointed.",1390435200,,935,4.606060606060606
8512662,1,B0079C7HNK,"set one and two played on my new bluray player, but this did not. I loved the first two and was bummed.",1386892800,,103,3.727272727272727
8512663,5,B0079C7HNK,"Good story.  However, ""Above Suspicion 3""  is an exact duplicate of disc 2, Above Suspicion Series 2"".
So, pay close attention of further releases titles.",1382918400,,154,5.12
8512664,5,B0079C7HNK,"I'm confused.  I bought Above Suspicion 2, having very much enjoyed watching the first in this excellent series.  Above Suspicion 2 is, like Above Suspicion 3, also titled Deadly Intent.  The only difference between the two seems to be that Above Suspicion 3 isn't designed to play in the US.
What's going on here?",1381104000,,314,4.777777777777778
8512665,5,B0079C7HNK,"I enjoyed it and would enjoy seeing more episodes, if possible.  I would like to view the Red Dahlia  if possible.",1365465600,,114,4.380952380952381
8512666,4,B0079C7HNK,The third in a series of TV show from England.  Writen by Lynda La Plante (good books too).  the chemstry between Langton (Ciaran Hinds) and Kelly Reilly ( Traves) is wonderful.  Must see all the are four shows.,1359244800,4,211,4.5
