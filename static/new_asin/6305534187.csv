1048516,4,6305534187,"I love this movie. It may not be the best, but I thought it was very cute. The movie was full of color  and great animation and the plot was unique, but the three cats who had kidnapped the children at the beginning seemed to drift into the background once they arrived back in their world. The cat's names are said so fast or so little that it's hard to catch them. They never really show what happens to Buburina at the end and the images of the boy abusing his dog were, to me, disturbing. Once the girl, Meeko, gets accidently separated from her brother she does her own thing which isn't much, except for making the villian (Buberina) REALLY angry.  This movie has a silent, ""be kind to your pets"" message which I thought was rather nice since it lets kids know it's not nice to abuse animals because once they're gone they won't get the chance to make amends. Apart from little things, like not being able to quite catch the cat's names, this was an enjoyable, fun film. I highly recommend this movie because it's unique, fun and whimsical.",982886400,3,1046,4.414507772020725

To my surprise, the movie was interesting, cute, and all-around fun. And I would actually recomend this movie.(Not to mention would love to see it again!) one thing you should be aware of is in the Subbtitled version they seem to say ""damn"" a lot which suprised me, since it's advertised as a kids movie.",977702400,6,467,4.142857142857143

Even though I only read snatches of the English, here and there, and her first grade reading let her read only very short parts, she was fascinated with the story and the relationship between Meeko and Toriyasu and of course Papadoll.
She also started repeating some of the Japanese phrases, ""mushka, mushka, mushka"" (ph) being her favorite!
Buburina is ""pretty"" but bad--and this was a good lesson for a little girl, usually seeing things like Snow White and Cinderella where the bad are also ugly!
The story is wildly fantastic--clearly not based in reality--which has its own charm.  Especially since the relating is very human.",974419200,,710,4.949579831932773

7891733,5,6305534187,"Catnapped! is playful, beautiful, rowdy and hilarious. I had no expectations toward it and I loved it. Directed by Takashi Nakamura, it's a crazy and incredible animated film full of engaging characters and rowdy worlds.

Catnapped! is the story of 10-year old disgruntled Toriyasu and his energetic little sister Meeko. Their dog Papadoll has disappeared, and Toriyasu pretends not to be bothered. However, when three characters from the cat world Banipal Witt ask for their help, they find themselves taken to this colourful world (where they themselves turn into cats) that exists in another dimension. Papadoll, their pooch has turned into a mad monster on the loose. Perhaps an even greater threat is the unscrupulous princess Buburina who turns everyone who annoys her into balloons by touching them. Toriyasu and Meeko have to bring Papdoll back to normal before the sun strikes the next day, or they will go mad like him.

Once you see Catnapped!, you will never forget it, even if you have seen many Japanese animated films. Its world is like a crossing between Discworld and the most lavish carnival you could ever imagine, populated by anthropomorphic cats in hot-air balloon contraptions. The visual style of the movie is great. All the animation is excellent, and the characters are wonderful (my favourite is Hoi Hoi, the moustachioed pilot).

The story is also excellent and has many layers. It is wildly unpredictable and told in a very satisfying manner. There is indeed more to Toriyasu and Papadoll's relationship than meets the eye, as indeed is there more to the princess (and not everything works out right, for you pessimists out there!).

Some people dismiss this film as being too cute. I digress, and find no grounds for the criticism. Catnapped! is a colourful film overflowing with character, action and humour. It's one of the best animated films I've discovered in a long time, and its age isn't even showing, 15 years on!",1287100800,,1952,5.015432098765432
7891734,2,6305534187,"Catnapped! was created, written, and directed by Takashi Nakamura.  His other notable work was serving as the animation director on Akira.

Catnapped! takes place in a location called Banipal Witt, and its populated by anthropomorphic cats.  It is ruled by Buburina, a cruel witch princess who has the ability to turn any living thing into a balloon by simply touching it.  She kidnaps a dog named Papadoll, who she intends to use to take over the world.  The dog's owners, two kids named Toriyasu and Meeko, must try to turn him back to normal and return him to their world.

The film clocks in at 75 minutes, and I have to give credit to Nakamura for utilizing this short time to the fullest to tell his story.  While my children enjoyed watching this film, I felt as if I was watching someone's drug trip.  But I do have to also give credit to the film'sanimation; it fits in with the fantasy feel Nakamura appeared to strive for.

The DVD was rather disappointing.  There was very little in the way of special features, and the movie automatically starts instead of going to the main meny first.  But it appears that this pressing of the DVD was originally released in 1998, which was during the first year or so of DVDs (which would have been before much effort was put into special features).

While Catnapped! is a film that can be appreciated by children, it utlimately leaves the adults watching with them scratching their heads and wondering what they just watched for the past 75 minutes.",1209513600,,1499,4.636363636363637
7891735,3,6305534187,"Catnapped is a really bizarre combination of anime styles. On one hand you have Takashi Nakamura, famous for his violent Akira bloodfest. On the other hand, you have a cat-world movie clearly aimed at 5 year olds.

You begin with a sister and brother. Toriyasu, the boy, is about 10 and is a snide bully. He kicks his dog, hits his sister and is generally unpleasant. Meeko, the sister, talks constantly in a very high pitched voice tinged with a whine. In very short order it turns out that the dog has been kidnapped off to a cat world by an ""evil princess"". The cat people come to take Tori and sis along in order to set things to rights.

Now, before I continue, let me make it clear that I'm a big fan of little kid anime. I think it can be a wonderful way to draw youngsters into the wide world of anime. It can teach a great moral lesson while entertaining as well. Kids can even learn Japanese!

So that being said, I was pretty disappointed with Catnapped. The brother and sister both begin as unappealing characters. The whole dog-kicking upset me quite a bit. It's one thing to say ""the boy gets grumpy"". It's quite another to say ""the boy physically abuses his pet"" as a normal course of events. The evil princess begins as being completely spoiled by her king-and-queen parents - the point that she puts another young girl in (literally) a life and death situation, causing the child to fall nearly to her death. The parents allowed this?? If anyone was to be punished, it was the PARENTS for being such incredibly neglectful adults that in any state I know of the DSS would have swooped in.

The princess gets cursed for her parents' faults and everyone she touches inflates like a balloon. It sets up a whole ""Yikes this is awful because now I'm big"" series of commentary. There are also several comments by boys and girls making disparaging comments about being heavy. The stuck-on-herself princess is ""Pretty but Nasty"" which is quite the stereotype

Ah, but there's more. A young boy that was studying magic ""went too far"" because of his love for the princess, stole a magic glove, and also became completely cruel and evil as a result. He is dedicated to the princess and wants to join her on her quest.

Here's the quest. With the stolen and now large-and-obedient-to-evil dog, they gobble up a bunch of the cat townsfolk. The princess inflates them all into balloons. She stuffs them into a giant mouse-shaped blimp. This cat world is all sitting on top of a sleeping cat. Just to give some background here, the Hindu religion believes the world sit on an elephant, which sits on a turtle. This sort of visual symbol has been used in many sci-fi stories.

In any case, the princess' thought here is to send the mouse to wake up the cat so it ""shakes the world"" causing pain to everyone. Then she'll send in the dog to ... put the cat to sleep. This is her plan. It makes no sense at all. Dogs don't put cats to sleep. Also if her plan is just to put the cat to sleep again, what is her aim? To destroy her own world? She could already do that with the dog. To make the populace fear her? They already do, because of her balloon abilities.

Kid films usually don't involve a lot of violence; they involve lesson learning and problem solving. However, Catnapped takes great delight in delivering pain. The princess not only inflates people into balloons - but she pops them so that their skin explodes and they die. I mentioned the forcing-child-to-fall-to-near death. I mentioned the boy-repeatedly-viciously-kicking-pet.

I kept hoping for a Beauty and the Beast ending. If anything, the princess was the most ""innocent"" here. She was mis-raised by her parents. She was cursed pretty nastily. She had a boy still quite in love with her. She actually loved the dog greatly, talking sweetly to him, snuggling with him, taking tender care of him. Considering the dog's ""real"" owner kicked him frequently, I was voting for the dog to stay with the princess and that she'd get over the curse!

But nooooo. First we have a ""final countdown to doom"" which is completely meaningless - the time scale keeps changing randomly. You have a super-potent sleeping pill that would put the dog to sleep for a solid week - but when the princess swallows it, she barely nods off 2 or 3 times. The final lesson seems to be that a person who is abused should stay with that abuser even if a loving person comes along, because it's better to be loyal. I shook my head in disbelief.

The graphics are very simple - but not in a high-quality-done-clearly sort of way. They are simple in the not-much-effort way. Yes, the design was done well. The home ""normal"" graphics are low key and very comfortable seeming, with quiet streets and a clean (too clean?) bedroom. The ""cat world"" graphics are a kid's imaginative dream of a fantasy land - full of carnival toys, day-night designs seemingly stolen from a baby's mobile, and random round objects thrown in everywhere for visual interest. While the design was quite interesting, the animation just isn't well done. Many scenes seem to use cookie cutter characters replicated many times in the room, or loops of video.

It's a shame to say ""they're only kids so they can make do with low quality graphics, storyline and moral results."" That stance really bothers me a lot. Sure kids would overlook the really bizarre humans-with-cat-makeup style of the cat people, or the other issues. But given the many other anime greats that DO suit a kid's audience and provide them with a fantastic wealth of imagery, storyline and resolution, why settle for a lower quality item? It's even more upsetting to me that Takashi Nakamura could have done far better with this storyline and animation. Why did he feel adults were worthy of what he put into Akira - but that kids would be OK with only a half hearted effort?

The movie ""ends"" with the kids waking up to race off to school. The princess and her boyfriend are still as cursed as before, and all that has really happened is that the two kids have removed the dog from her control. The boy promises to be better to the dog now - but will he really be as truly loving and snuggly as the princess had proven herself to be? He certainly doesn't mind bashing his sister on the head as they head out to school. The cat people show up in hot pursuit, because there's a new problem, and that's how the movie ends. It can't even just end - it has to make sure there is a sequel.

I really really tried to love this movie. I am always eager to add to the list of children's anime I can recommend to parents. This movie just isn't it. It is a pale shadow of the many other incredibly high quality children's anime titles that DO exist out there. If you've got kids, make sure you've already gotten the other titles before you work your way down to this one.",1140220800,4,6837,4.52998379254457
7891736,5,6305534187,"I saw this at an Anime festival in 1996 and never knew the name. It has been stuck in my head and I've asked every single friend from Japan if they knew what it was and if they knew the name. Everyone seemed to recognize the theme, but no one knew what it was called in English. The bright amazing colors, fun yet psychadelic story, lovely yet simple animation style. It obviously impressed me enough to have looked for it the past 9 years, so I would highly recommend this to any Anime fan who appreciates more than just the traditional graphic style of most Anime films. And it's definitely great for kids!",1110499200,4,608,4.389380530973451

I just need to know what the Geneon version offers that is not on the regular version? Is there a commentary track? What exactly is different?",1073347200,7,334,4.583333333333333
7891738,4,6305534187,"After neglecting his dog Papadoll, Toriyasu loses him and doesn't know where to find him. Will Papadoll even want to come back to Toriyasu, after he neglected him before? Catnapped (1995) is zany and crazy; the backgrounds are very colorful, but strange. The scenery is gorgeous and it really reminds me of Little Nemo. Both boys and girls would like it. I got interested in it when I found out it was directed by the same director as Akira, Takashi Nakamura.
What I like most is the really good-looking character animations; they're wonderful. They are beautiful anthropomorphs. They're cute, but not babyish. The music is good. The animated frame rate is as good as you can get for an anime, it never seems stiff. As a university student, the overall tone is a little childish, but it is really hilarious and entertaining, so that makes up for it. Monster Papadoll is hysterical; he's cute but freaky. It's light-hearted and there is action, but not violence. If you are looking for a movie that's dark or scary, this will not do. The DVD is bilingual and it includes character information.  By the way, it's normal for kid shows in Japan to have swears, so note there are some swears in the subtitled format. Catnapped is an unexpected anime and it's very creative and original.

7891739,4,6305534187,"Take a couple of Japanese children, mix in a lot of cats, add a little YELLOW SUBMARINE style, wrap it together with a race against the clock, and you get one of the more original animated films to come along in years.
CATNAPPED! was originally released theatrically in Japan in 1995 as TOTSUZEN! NEKO NO KUNI BANIPAL WITT. The story begins in Japan, with Toriyasu, a young disgruntled boy whose dog has mysteriously disappeared, and his little spunky sister Meeko. One day, on the way to school Meeko catches a glimpse of a cat dressed in a coat slipping through the shadows. All this eventually leads a very reluctant Toriyasu and an enthusiastic Meeko journeying with three strange cats in their craft to the magical world of Banipal Witt. There they discover their dog Papadoll has somehow turned into a huge flying monster under the control of the bratty evil sorceress Buburina. With Chu Chu's help, Toriyasu's task is to help turn Papadoll back to normal and bring his dog and his sister home before the sun rises again in Banipal Witt. If they don't make it, Papdoll will stay a monster forever!
The backgrounds and architecture seems straight out of a children's dream with a strange hybrid of toys, balloons, trains and more. It does a great job of explaining all the characters' motivations throughout the film, and it is great to see the development Toriyasu undergoes from his start as a mean, downtrodden kid. The audience is led to cheer on and care for the heroes, but even the antagonists are not completely evil and you can feel a bit for them too. There is enough action to keep you involved throughout the film, starting from the initial warping to Banipal Witt until the ending climax.
CATNAPPED! is a fun and wild ride for both the young and the young at heart.",1006646400,13,1783,4.681528662420382
7891740,4,6305534187,"CATNAPPED! is one of a very few anime titles that is genuinely a children's story.  This delightful tale is perfect for anyone from pre-teen to toddler, but probably a bit too simplistic for older children.  Adults will enjoy it as a throw-back to simpler, more innocent times.
The story revolves around a young boy, his younger sister, and a kidnapped pet dog.  Well, actually, the dog hasn't been kidnapped, he's been CATNAPPED!  The poor pooch has been shanghied to an alien world inhabited entirely by cats.  How our intrepid hero and heroine, with their entourage of catlike allies, rescue their pet and save the CatWorld is the bread and butter of this tale.
CATNAPPED! is animated in a simpler style than most anime films.  It is far more cartoonish than its near computer-graphic quality cousins.  However, this is a plus, not a minus.  The characters and scenery are simple, bright, bold and colorful, sure to hold a younger viewers attention.  While the action is non-stop, there is no violence, strong-language or sexual content of any kind.
If you are looking for a gentle, fun film to share with your children, or to help you enjoy a few minutes reclaiming your own childhood, CATNAPPED! is an excellent choice.  It won't please the Dragonball Z, martial arts crowd, but for simple, colorful entertainment, it hits the mark.  Highly recommended.",988848000,18,1358,4.938325991189427
