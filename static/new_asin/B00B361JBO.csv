8562050,3,B00B361JBO,"On the 8th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...The 4 Team Elimination Match: The Godwins vs. Furnas and Lafon vs. The New Blackjacks vs. The Headbangers was pretty bland. The Intercontinental Championship: Rocky Maivia vs. The Sultan wasn't very good and so-so at best. The Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs. Goldust match was pretty boring at times, but was perfectly acceptable wrestling at other times. The WWF Tag Titles match: Owen Hart and The British Bulldog vs. Mankind and Vader was decent even with the dumb ending. The Submission Match: Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin was a bloody,hardcore,smash-mouth brawl with a awesome ending to boot. The Chicago Street Fight: The Nation of Domination vs. Ahmed Johnson and The Legion of Doom was not as hardcore as the submission match but it was still fun and entertaining to watch. The WWF Title: No Disqualification match: Sid vs. The Undertaker was mostly boring with a pretty good ending to save to it. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1419120000,,984,4.794117647058823
8562051,3,B00B361JBO,"1.) Fatal 4 Way Elimination Tag Team Match: The Headbangers vs The New Blackjacks vs The Godwinns vs Doug Furnas and Phil Lafon

The stipulation of this match was that the winners would get a Tag Team Championship match the following night on Raw. Somewhat of a decent match opening but not at all interesting. This felt more like a match that should've happened on Raw, rather than open the biggest PPV of the year. Headbanger Mosh puts away Phineas Goddwin  at the end to get the win

2.) The Great Sultan w/Iron Shiek and Bob Backlund vs Rocky Maivia

The Rock or Rocky was just getting started in the WWF and he was literally hated by almost all the fans. It looked like he tried to get the fans behind him before the match started, but failed miserably at it. They even chanted ""Rocky sucks!"" during the match. Rocky was still learning so this wasn't the best match. In fact, it was pretty bad. Great Sultan didn't make it any better. The only thing worth watching this match for his hearing Jerry Lawler's hilarious commentary and Honky Tonk Man's (who was a guest commentator for the match). Rocky wins with a roll up. Sultan, Backlund, and Shiek attack Maivia after the match and Rocky Johnson comes to Rocky's rescue

3.) Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna vs Goldust w/Marlena

The feud between Goldust and HHH is an underrated one on certain levels. The feud had heated up over the last month or so with Marlena and Chyna playing center piece roles in the middle of it all. Although this match ran slow at times, it was was very standard with moments of nice athleticism being shown. Towards the end, Chyna bearhugs Marlena, which distracts Goldust and allows Helmsley to Pedigree ""The Bizzare One"" for the pinfall win

4.) Tag Team Championship Match: Vader and Mankind w/Paul Bearer vs Owen Hart and British Bulldog (c)

This was an interesting match. Both teams in this match were heel so there were no fan favorites at all. There was also tension building between Bulldog and Owen, which made things a bit more tense for the match. Great offense from both teams throughout the match. Owen and Bulldog were always great together. Lawler is really funny on commentary once it's revealed that Stu and Helen Hart are at ringside. He makes jokes about them from there on out. The match gets a disappointing ending with Mankind getting himself and Bulldog counted out when he had the Mandible Claw on Bulldog. A disappointing ending to a great match

5.) Submission Match: Bret Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

After pretty much a lackluster show throughout the night, this was the match that everyone had been waiting to see and it finally came! This is probably the greatest technical grappling match to happen in Wrestlemania history----and maybe WWE history! Both Bret and Austin gave each other hell in this match and it was captivating all the way throughout! Ken Shamrock was the guest referee because he knew submission and wouldn't be intimidated by either man. Things get brutal when Austin gets busted open. Bret wins with the Sharpshooter after a bloody Austin passed out from the pain and attacks Austin after the match, starting the double turn. I wouldn't say it's the best exciting match of all time, but it's one of them! Great full-throttle action and definitely began Steve Austin's rise to the top as a main eventer in the company

6.) 6 Man Tag Team Chicago Street Fight: The Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush, and Savio Vega) w/PG-13 and D'Lo Brown vs The Legion of Doom and Ahmed Johnson

This was a fun and action packed match to follow the Submission Match. There were no tags in this match, so all 6 men were fighting inside, outside, and around the ring all at once. It was exciting! A variety of weapons were used throughout this match, including a nightstick, a fire extinguisher, a trash can, a street sign, and so much more. It's hard to keep up with the action at times because there's so much going on around the ring. LOD and Ahmed Johnson get the win with a pin over Crush.

7.) No DQ WWF Championship Match: The Undertaker vs Sycho Sid (c)

Shawn Michaels came out to do some hilarious commentary which was needed for this match. Hearing him and Jerry Lawler get into it with each other was a treat in and of itself. As for the main event, some of the work was decent for the most part, but this match could not compete with the previous 2 matches just witnessed. Kind of a bad idea to have this match go after the Submission Match and Street Fight. Mid-way through the match, Bret Hart came out to boos from the crowd and mouthed off to Michaels before trash talking Undertaker and Sid. Bret even attacked Sid multiple times throughout the match and Shawn's comments on his interferences are hysterical. Undertaker ends up Tombstoning Sid to win the WWF Championship and fans were probably happy that this one was over. One of the worst main events in Wrestlemania history to end a not so good show",1395532800,3,5159,4.83427922814983
8562052,4,B00B361JBO,Takers first title win at mania. Bretts last mania apperance. Austins first mania moment. Worth the buy. Oh and can't forget the return of L.O.D,1375574400,,144,4.8
8562053,4,B00B361JBO,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

WrestleMania returned to Chicago at the Rosemont Horizon in what was perfectly described as ""Heat"" as this event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield, Chyna, Mick ""Mankind"" Foley, Ken Shamrock, Ron ""Faarooq"" Simmons, and Rocky Maivia/The Rock.

The match that this event is remembered for is the classic Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin Submission Match with Ken Shamrock as the special referee that went through such an arrange of emotions to the point where the crowd switched sides & had the unforgettable image of Austin having the blood pouring out of his head while in the Sharpshooter.  WWE Champion Sycho Sid defended his championship against Undertaker who returned to his classic look in a No Disqualification Match that was very similar to the match with Diesel the previous year where Taker not only fought a giant like himself but one who actually was able to put up & bring out a fight from Taker.  Another memorable match here was the Chicago Street Fight in Ahmed Johnson teaming with Chicago's own & the returning Legion Of Doom vs. The Nation Of Domination that saw the entire gang getting involved with various weapons & non-stop brawling all over the place to the point where not everyone walked away without their share of injuries.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia vs. The Sultan in what's mostly remembered for the seeds being planted for ""The Rock"" via the crowd reaction to him, Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & British Bulldog vs. Mankind & Vader, Hunter Hearst-Helmsley vs. Goldust, and Headbangers vs. Godwinns vs. New Blackjacks vs. Doug Furnas & Phil Lafond.

This event began the shift from their ""New Generation"" era into what we would eventually call ""The Attitude Era"" as more realism & aggression was starting to be displayed at this Mania more than previous ones with the Chicago crowd being very vocal that only made things even better so this is a Mania that I would recommend to check out.",1364688000,3,2322,4.895674300254453
