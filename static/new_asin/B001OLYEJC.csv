8330815,1,B001OLYEJC,This is the only purchase I've ever returned to Amazon. The video looked like it was shot in an impoverished church hall. Total running time was about ninety minutes but only thirty minutes of actual instruction. The same instruction was shot from three different angles. Some of the thirty minutes was idle feel good chatter. Stage left was a kitchen area where a rat made numerous appearances in clear view. Did they view this before production or did they just not care? Amazon has emailed me promising a full refund. Thank you Amazon. Look elsewhere for your dance instruction. You will learn nothing from this video.,1273449600,3,621,4.867924528301887
8330816,5,B001OLYEJC,"This video is an introduction to the REAL argentine tango - not that fakey ""Ballroom Tango"" some like to delude themselves with. An excellent video, both in terms of content and production. If you are interested in learning tango, this is definitely one to get.",1249171200,2,261,4.822222222222222
8330817,5,B001OLYEJC,"For the absolute beginner in tango I recommend two DVDs.  This one comes first.  Sridhar and Celine teach how to begin the tango walk and a few elementary movements.  But very much more important, they convey the importance and feel for the Argentine Tango connection between the partners, the feel of the close embrace, and a sense of musicality with that inimitable tango music.
Even though I've been dancing Argentine tango for a few years, I found it to be a nice review myself. The video can be viewed from several different angles.  I found the overhead shots novel and helpful.
Back to beginners.  Once you've gotten started check out the instructional videos of Cristy Cote and George Garcia at Dancevision.  They teach some more basic steps nicely, but the DVD is much more expensive.",1244073600,3,793,4.837037037037037
