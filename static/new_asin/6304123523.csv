792853,5,6304123523,"This TV animation series opened up many disputes among the fun just after the ending of the series. It starts rather lightly, getting deeper and deeper on the process, and then ended in a halfway, never giving answers to many questions they threw to the viewers... The director Anno and his team, GINAX, promised to answer the unsolved questions in their theater version in the summer of 1997, and released two theater version, still it cannot satisfy the fan waited so long...  Many books on ""studying Evangelion"" are published, and more comics by amateur comic artists inspired by this animation are published (many of these comics are adult version though...). Intellectuals are trying to comment on the ""Evangelion syndromes"" among the young generation in Japan.  This is a story of a 14-year-old boy who destinized to save the earth by operating a human-being type robot named Evangelion or Eva. Shinji, the hero is an apathetic junior-high student who was deserted his father. One day, his father invite to join him and he visited his father only to confront to participate in Evangelion project. Just the day of the arrival, he was forced to confront the enemy, called ""apostle"" in gigantic robot named Evangelion...  I'm interested in this animation why it attracted so many Japanese youth. Apathetic Shinji tells himself, ""Never escape! Never escape!"" He is very awkward to build human relations but he tries his own way... Maybe it's the self-image of Japanese youth, and also myself...  With quick tempo of the events and deep insights, you never regret to see it!  END",881020800,,1580,4.992395437262357

792927,5,6304123523,"I've always known of this anime and my friends were always telling me how great it is so I just had to have it. It was one of the best things I have ever seen. The battle scenes were awesome and the characters aren't like any others that I've seen, they are so deep and complex. It has the perfect blend of sci-fi action and humor. The animation is excellent and the music is great. It is a wonderful anime overall and recommend it to anyone.",979948800,,442,4.151162790697675
792928,5,6304123523,"When I saw the fan edit of Eva put to Rammstein - Engel, I was hooked to this series.  I couldn't get my eyes of the beautiful Asuka.  I downloaded a couple of epps, and I knew that I had to have this series.  Now I am amasing a collection of Eva videos, both subbed and dubbed, just to see them both.  I got started on anime back in the 4th grade, and now that I'm older and can understand the meaning behind it, I am glad to have revived my addiction with Eva.",979171200,,462,3.882978723404255
792929,5,6304123523,"I am a big anime fan, but this one takes the cake.  I usually am not very impressed by ""giant robot"" anime.  Evangelion is not a normal ""giant robot"" saga.  The psychological depths will stun you.  The first eight or so episodes are deceptively straightforward and simple, giving you a false since of security, then BAM!  Everything goes crazy.  Evangelion does things with human drama that I have never seen before.  The show keeps you guessing until the last second of the last episode.  Don't think that the show focuses on the robots or the action (although both are impressive).  The main thing about the show is the characters.  They are so diverse and different that you will remember all of them forever.  If you want to see a good plot, then see Evangelion.  As far as the first video goes, it is a fitting beginning to the series.  There is drama, action, intrigue, and even some symbolism.  If you are wondering about appropriateness, it does not have nudity, but there are some mature scenes.  It is not very gorey, just intense.  I promise that if you don't see it, you will be missing out.",973468800,2,1103,4.579487179487179
792930,5,6304123523,"Wow, this is probably one of the best anime series I have seen.  A friend of mine turned me on to Evangelion and I am so grateful.  I can't wait to see the rest, although I hear the end of the series is quite incoherent. If you are an otaku of any variety, see this series, you won't regret it!",973382400,,294,3.8833333333333333
792931,5,6304123523,"I absolutley loved this video!  I mean the first episode was so serious  but the second episode I really laughed hard, and I didn't know it was  coming.  I am pretty sure the show stays really serious so I think the  second episode was sort of a way to lighten things a bit before it really  gets going.  I mean they even have a cute animal masscot!
Ok, the dub  was good and I alot of the voices fit.  I was expecting a deeper voice on  the main character but then I realised he is just a little kid, so I ended  up liking the voice.  The quality was great and my only problem is that  there are only two episodes per tape.  But the DVD has four so that helps  alot.",969062400,,667,3.946969696969697
792932,5,6304123523,"I've only recently begun branching out into other types of anime besides mahou shojo (magical girl), and I have to say that Evangelion makes it all  worth it.  As of today (8/12/00) I've only seen this video (that will SOON  change), but due to both my friends' craze for Evangelion and the appeal  that just the first two episodes had for me, I feel that I have to agree  that NGE is among the greatest anime sagas.  I've seen Gundam Wing and  Fushigi Yugi, both arguably among the great anime series in terms of human  drama; however neither of them started with as much of an enthralling  opening as Evangelion.
On another note, the dubbing was much better than  I expected.  I had heard reports of how badly Evangelion had been dubbed  (something different for ADV, which my friends usually give good reports  of); however I thought that the dubbing, while not Gundam Wing-quality, was  definitely better than most commercially-released shows.  I especially  liked the choices for Shinji and his father, although Masato's voice got a  little annoying at times.
All in all, I would give this video 5 stars (or  more if possible).  It was a great opening, full of action (the battle with  the Third Angel), drama, confusing mystery, humor (Masato...0_o) and the  sense of the deeper story to come... I would recommend it for any anime  fan.",966038400,4,1342,4.743478260869566
792933,5,6304123523,The first time I saw the Evangelion series mentioned...I was in a hobby  shop and saw the model kits. I also saw that it was made from Bandai...so I  know that this series had to unique and original. So I went to my local  video store and rented it. The next day I went out and bought it because it  I knew it was the beginning to an amazing series that I would love for  years to come. It is the only anime series that I haven't gone on the  internet to find out what happens next. Neon Genesis Evangelion is easily  one of the best anime I have ever seen.,965260800,,557,3.963963963963964
792934,5,6304123523,"Evangelion is really an AWESOME anime. The characters are funny, twisted, and all individual, the fight scenes are powerful and really cool, &  the storyline is amazing.
EVA (which is set in the year 2015, 14 years  after the 2nd impact occured & nearly destroyed the world) is about 3  teens(Rei Ayanami, Shinji Ikari, & Asuka Langely)who each pilot a  special EVA robot. These robots are designed to fight & kill angels  that are evil spirits that are capable of causing another impact.
However  there is alot more in the show than just fighting. Shinji & Asuka live  with a pretty young lady (Misato) who assists with the EVAs (and manages to  keep a great figure and complexion despite a passion for fatty foods and  beer), & Rei lives in an apartment on her own. To the other two, Rei is  a bit of a mystery. Unlike Asuka, she is quiet, withdrawn, emtionless.
As  you get deeper into the story, it lessens on its wry sense of humour &  starts to get darker & deeper, revealing shocking things about the  teen's pasts (How Shinji's father abandoned him, the suicide of Asuka's  mother, & a glimpse of Rei's true identity), the intensity level goes  through the roof, & the final episode...
Well I don't want to spoil  it, but I'll say this...
This is a dark, powerful, moving anime & is  highly recommended to all anime fans.",965174400,2,1329,4.563559322033898
792935,5,6304123523,"For those of you who love anime this is one series that you should not pass on. Never before have I seen a series that focused so well on the characters, making you actually care about them. The plot deals with the  year 2015, half of the world has been flooded due to an event called second  impact. A secret orginization known as NERV has been formed to protect the  world from the oncoming assualt of an aline race called the Angels. The  angels being imune to all conventional weapons can only be destroyed by  NERV's secret weapons, Evangelions. The piolets for these giant robots are  15 year old kids whom have serious psychological problems, yet I don't want  to spoil it for you. Granted the series is not cheap, it is well worth your  money. One little note I will tell you is that the series gets even better  as you progress through it.",960940800,,848,4.419354838709677
792992,5,6304123523,"Evangelion.  The word can be recognized by nearly every anime fan in the U.S.  It is easily the most popular, and best anime ever devised for TV, Movies, etc.  The characters are some of the best, and you can relate to at  least one of them by the end of the series.  The characters even go through  a sort of de-evolution during the end of the series, and Shinji proves that  he's insane with all those friends he has in his head.  But enough about  the last few episodes.
The first few episodes of Evangelion will pull you  in and never let you go.  Whether you buy it dubbed or subbed, you will  never, ever dislike this series unless you're too dense to realize it's  brilliance.
The mecha in the series is unlike anything you'll ever see.  The Macross and Gundam designs are usually for the most part the same, but  the Evangelion designs are much more original and more realistic.  The  Evangelions all have their own specific design and all are connected to  their pilot's personality in some way.
Hideaki Anno, the series director,  is a true genius from the beginning to the end of the series, and even  pushing his art known as Evangelion to a further point with  ""Death/Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" (the movies,  which will be both compiled into one movie for release in the U.S. known as  ""Rebirth of Evangelion"").

792995,5,6304123523,"Well, first I would like to say that this is the best anime I have ever seen, but I also want to tell people a bit about it.  Evangelion may first seem like a really cool anime about killing angels from God.  It is really  about how ignorant the human race is because if God did send angels down to  Earth we would probably try to destroy them (watch it and notice how the  angels never attack first).  I just think everyone should know that it is  somewhat making fun of humans and I totally agree with it.",955497600,,507,4.112244897959184

792997,3,6304123523,"I hate being the only bad review, but I found that for all the hype and 'controversy' about this series, I really didn't enjoy the first video. I give it three stars, but I would rate it at 50%, because I found the  drawings were extremely good. But, upon thinking it would be more serious,  I found out it had a tendency to be Sailor-Moonish (unless the dubbing was  just really bad). I'msure the story gets better later on, but this first  volume will not entice me to get future ones. If anybody can e-mail me and  maybe persuade me that the other volumes aren't as immature or have better  story, than I may continue... but, until then, I can only rate what I feel  of this series.

The story is just breathtaking.  It starts off on this volume with  alot of plots that turn into really big things later on in the series...The  characters are great.  Some you can really relate too(hopefully you don't  relate too much with these people).  There is so many things I can say  about this series. It makes you go through great catharsis. Some scenes are  so well done that you just sit there in awe. I could barely move only my  mouth was open  through the last 15 minutes of an episode.

I own all the videos(including bootlegs of the movies which ADV films is not planning on releasing ""NOOOOOOOOO!

The  characters are amazing and althought the EVA fights aren't that long, they  are still great.  But the anime is more focused on the human (and  non-human...""dum-dum-dummmmmm!"") characters of the story.  Its  almost impossible to explain the story to your friends, you have to watch  it to understand.  The story starts off on a happy beat more or less but as  the tapes go on, the story starts getting darker, and darker, and even more  twisted...oh, if only ADV would release the movies!

Gainax's story and character designs are, as  usual, a brilliant font of consistency that have made this title stand out  among its peers like no other (at least the subtitled version does - I  haven't seen the dub). The combination of sci-fi and philosophy would do  authors like Bob Heinlein proud. Gainax is the best anime studio out there,  and I'm glad to see they're eager to show us why. Oh, and anyone that  thinks Gainax's clean, powerful animation style is ...less than average...  is probably one of the clique that watches Akira to see people's heads  explode.

Simply put, this show goes simply beyond  ""entertaining"", and into the territory of ""thoroughly  involving"", and to a degree that few shows, including the X-files and  Gundam wing, have even come close to.  The plot is deceptively simple at  first, part of what makes it so powerful.  It starts out as apparently a  simple ""giant robot"" anime with some subtle hints of what may  come, but in the latter half of the series, takes a full-fledged nosedive  into the depths of human emotion, with shocking truths about the series,  God, government conspiracies, and mankind being craftily revealed along the  way by director Hideaki Anno.  One may believe that ""deep"" anime  is nothing new, citing examples of Akira and Ghost in the Shell, but  neither of these so successfully overwhelmed the viewer with the story, nor  did they actually make you really want to figure ot the meaning.

793150,5,6304123523,"Neon Genesis is one of the greatest anime series out to date.  The story is great how they relate religon with a story of humanoid robots that defend the earth.  I think having a child piloting a gigantic humaniod and  to synch with it is never been done before making the story even  better(also a bit more confusing),even though I still have to watch them  all to understand the story and the plots behind each character its still a  great series from A.D.V films.  The characters they created were well voice  acted and animated, giving them a more realistic feel.  Also the way they  tied in polotics and goverments was excellent, that made the plot better,  making you try to figure out out whos really trying to save the earth.  In  my opinion, Neon Genesis is the greatest anime series out.  In Volume 1  Shinji, one of the three main characters, gets caught in the middle of this  war of saving the earth far to quickly, confusing him of whats going onand  what he should do. NERV was created to stop Angels(enemy) and Shinji is  asked to pilot a EVA to destroy the Angel before it destroys everything, to  find out everything else find out for yourself.",923616000,3,1162,4.526570048309178

Also, I would have given it less stars if I was able to find a place that sells Japanese imports of this series.",1028678400,,244,3.803921568627451
7862888,4,6304123523,"I rented the first two volumes of this show to see if I would like it or not.  Turns out that the first four episodes are really enjoyable to me.
Of course, I would have to show my disappointment for how many episodes were placed per VHS.  2 just simply isn't enough, and I wouldn't even think about purchasing it if they charge over $20.
Now, on to the story.  It's actually quite moving, the world is in a desperate time, when the Angels have attacked for the first time in fifteen years.  Shinji is called over by his father to help them fight.  He is rather anti-social and very unsure of what to do.  This shows just the type of character that he is.  So far, he has managed to defeat 2 angels (I'm moving on to the second volume here), and even then, he's still unsure of what to do.
Personally, I'm really liking what I'm seeing so far.  And I've been hearing that the ending to this series is rather disappointing, and I certainly hope that this isn't the case.  I have rarely found any anime that I disliked, and if you like mecha shows, or not sure if you think you'll like it or not, go and rent it.  I strongly urge rental first, just like what I did.
Some people may have a hard time getting into this series, but I for one like it, and I can't wait to see more.  To each their own, not everybody will like this series.  But, it doesn't hurt to give it a try.",1003968000,,1372,4.116541353383458
7862889,4,6304123523,"A twist on the old 'giant robot' genre, Evangelion's main character, Shinji, is quiet, shy, brooding, and absolutely nothing like the usual spunky heroes that hop in their machines and run off to face certain doom. This series is incredible, and I'm not a huge fan of mecha series. It gets very cerebral at times, and somewhat disturbing at others.",1000598400,,348,4.816666666666666
7862890,5,6304123523,"This is a video of the first two episodes in the series.  Already, however, we are introduced to some very complex themes, and the characters begin to strike us at this extremely early stage.  And for once the theme music is actually pretty good. ****************************************************************************************************** In the first episode, main character Shinji is brought before his distant father so that he can pilot the huge EVA-01 and fight off the monstrous ""Angels"" that are attacking the city.  The plot is started and we meet some important characters, including Ritsuki, an enigmatic scientist, Rei, the first EVA pilot, Misato, the perhaps over-stimulated commander of the EVA's, and Shinji's cold faher.  They all have their own mysteries that will be explored later on in the series.
In episode two, Shinji is brought to live with Captain Misato in her, um, house.  WIth her, um, penguin.  Don't worry, it's not that confusing... anyway, Shinji recals his battle with the Angel in the EVA machine and learns some more of the reasons that he was brought to work for NERV.  Basically an episode where some more of the character's feelings are revealed.",988416000,,1195,5.324468085106383
7862891,5,6304123523,"After watching the first tape of this, I immediatly fell in love with the main character, Shinji, and his supporting cast of Rei, his classmates, and Katsuragi.  While funny in spots, this is a more serious anime series, dealing with the invasion of beings called ""angels"" that caused the ""first impact"" or the destruction of antartica and the devestation of cities world wide.  Shiji, Rei, (and later Asuka) are pilots of huge bio-robots called Evangelions which battle the alien beings trying to destroy human civilization.  These bio-robots are built by a top secret organization called NERV which is headed by Shinji's defunct father, but founded on research done for the government by his deceased mother.
It is a very dark anime, but so well done that you get addicted anyway, and start asking yourself rather uncomfortable questions.  I'd recommend this anime to anyone, but only if they're ready to deal with some deep questions the series proposes.  If you're already dealing with depression etc, I'm not sure I'd recommend you watch this one. Anyone looking for light hearted anime is NOT going to find it here. This series is more along the lines of ""Bang, POP! There goes the world.""",983750400,2,1195,4.955
7862892,5,6304123523,"This volume contains the first two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, one of the most controversial animes around.  The animation is great and the dubbing is very well done, staying true to the original Japanese script.  The story takes place in the year 2015, in which alien monsters called ""Angels"" are attacking Tokyo-3.  The humans enlist a small number of teenagers (hey, it's anime)to pilot large robots to defeat these Angels.  That's where our unlikely and reluctant hero, Shinji, comes in, being summoned to Tokyo-3 to become a pilot.  A shocking story unfolds through the series filled with action, drama, and stunning science fiction.  These first episodes are great; they introduce the characters, who are pretty believable, and the battles yet to come.  A must-see for all anime fans!",980035200,,799,5.147286821705427
