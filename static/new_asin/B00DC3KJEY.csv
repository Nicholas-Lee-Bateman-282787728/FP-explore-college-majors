8591558,2,B00DC3KJEY,"Was disappointed with this DVD set. I am not a martial arts expert, but this DVD does not even explain what Krav Maga is or how it differs from any other martial art. The production value is low and looks like he filmed it in a conference room or perhaps a hotel. And even at that, it seems like they didn't even have that much space in the room and filmed it like two feet from a wall. Kind of strange in that regard. It seemed very disconnected. He just shows one technique after another and in that sense, seems very unrealistic. For instance, his attacker comes straight at him doing just one linear motion like a knee thrust or something, and then he shows a possible defense to that. And then on to the next. There is no coherence to it, no system, no over-arching principles, just one technique after another in complete isolation from one another, and never really explaining what the Krav Maga system is.

It just seems like a mish mash of disjointed techniques that are not presented in a realistic street-fighting way. It is like showing part of a dance move, then moving on to a different dance move, but not explaining how this would all connect into an actual dance. If you are looking to learn individual techniques that are explained in isolation from any system or style of fighting, then I suppose this succeeds at that level, but that was not what I was expecting or understood Krav Maga to be. It should have just been called 101 Miscellaneous Martial Art Techniques You Can Use If You Are Attacked In One Of 101 Ways but then I probably wouldn't have bought it.",1441497600,,1582,4.474048442906574
8591559,5,B00DC3KJEY,Very good with step by step breakdowns.i would recommend to have a sparring partner to get the most out of the dvd set.,1426204800,,119,4.217391304347826
8591560,1,B00DC3KJEY,"I reviewed this series when it was released as a Krav Maga home study course, which has since been removed from Amazon and re-packaged as this. The removal of the home study title series was done to remove negative reviews and start over, hence removing honest reviews from purchasers who not only purchased the product but the right to post a review as a certified buyer. These are the tactics of the individuals selling this product and I will use that as reason to be more brutally honest than before.
This is not true Krav Maga. This is instantly recognizable as someone who may have ranking in other martial arts and attended a weekend seminar or has read some books and bought some dvd's. It's a free world and I can't begrudge Mr. Hodge from trying to make a buck, but I do detest the ignorance towards self defense presented here.
What's being sold here is exactly what Mr. Hodge know's and that is how to create a false front of confidence and a string of victim's who will rely on poor training habit's when confronted by a true predator, and why would a black belt sell that?
I've trained with blue through black belts in Krav Maga, people who have been to Israel numerous times and a great expense to learn true Krav Maga and they move and fight much differently than what is presented here. My belief is that Mr. Hodge doesn't care and uses Krav as a way to pad his bank account like so many others have in recent times, creating watered down concepts and sparring drills with no practical use at the expense of the reputation of Krav Maga while using that very reputation to sell products.
To keep this from being an all out personal attack on Mr. Hodge I'll provide a few examples of where his techniques break down on the most fundamental levels, even white belts in legit Krav Maga systems would recognize these.
Any concept of a cover hand to protect the practitioners face is absent.
The base leg is not instructed to pivot to avoid knee injury.
On the straight kick defense the attacker punches Hodges in the face even at slow motion.
There is no indication of an actual Krav Maga stance during the drills, Hodge only displays a rustic Kata stance open for any number of attacks.
The knife defenses reflect the lack of experience on Hodge's part as he repeatedly goes for a grab at the elbow when performing an l block designed to make contact at the wrist.
The critiques I've made are from my time with people of wide experience, numerous years of training and who would never break their own fingers on an opponent's jaw as Mr. Hodge is doing on the cover of this series.",1416873600,6,2593,4.495762711864407
8591561,5,B00DC3KJEY,I really like these dvds put out by Michael Hodge.  Everything is explained SIMPLY.  I'm kinda a slow learner but can easily follow along with the dvd lessons.  I will buy Michael's next dvd series.,1403827200,,198,4.6
8591562,5,B00DC3KJEY,Great product for the price. He steps you through the movement and gives you examples of exercises you should do to reinforce your learning. He also does a good job of emphasizing that the purpose is to be defensive in nature. This is assuredly not a replacement for taking a course if you are really serious about training in Krav Maga but it does cover a lot of detail. If you are willing to put in the time to practice then I am certain you will be rewarded with a level of preparedness.,1382140800,,490,4.279569892473118
8591563,5,B00DC3KJEY,I purchased this as a gift for one interested in krav maga and it was well received.  Perfect for those interested.,1375660800,,115,4.476190476190476
8591564,5,B00DC3KJEY,"After taking Krav Maga classes for about seven months and then a break, I noticed this set of DVDs and thought to purchase it so that I could continue my training and maintain my skills.  I'm very pleased with the program and believe it would be suitable for anyone looking to learn about Krav Maga, continue their Krav training or improve their physical condition.

Each movement or technique is clearly demonstrated and from multiple angles.  The instructor also shows how to practice the technique as well as demonstrates its practical application.

Additionally, if you want to improve your cardio and physical conditioning then the prgram will help with that as well which is vital if you plan to take Krav Maga classes.

Again, I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this program and highly recommend it for personal training or as a compliment to taking instructor led classes.",1374537600,,892,4.92
8591565,5,B00DC3KJEY,"This is an excellent Krav Maga DVD set.  The 5 disk set contains all of the information and necessary step by step instructions to learn Krav Maga.  The think I like the most is the ability to rewind and watch the techniques over and over.

You will learn combatives, weapons defense and much more.....

Highly recommended product",1373846400,,330,4.7368421052631575
