8635705,3,B00HTRS0TK,"The idea behind this DVD is intriguing and stimulated some interesting discussion.
I would say to any prospective buyer unless you speak Hindi do not buy this item.
 The third story, which looked very contemporary and relevant to
events happening today, remained inaccessible due to the subtitles not working.
A disappointment all round.",1462665600,,337,5.3584905660377355

8635708,1,B00HTRS0TK,"Really slow and boring with abstract dialogue, muted plot and very irritating characters. Perhaps reflects reality, but I'm an avid fan of foreign films, especially as I'm from the sub-Continent, and this film put me to sleep.",1420329600,,226,5.135135135135135

8635711,5,B00HTRS0TK,"I stumbled upon this film by accident, and watched the trailer and 15 minutes of the film on YouTube. It was so intriguing that I decided to buy the blue ray edition from Amazon both to get the improved quality and to support the film maker (who, I hope, will get SOME royalties from this). The title of the film is suggestive of its content, which concentrates on three stories of people who need or have received transplanted organs, and how this situation changes their lives. The film is visually beautifully and the stories are compellingly told. It is in a mixture of Hindi and English, with subtitles available. The gentle pace at which the stories unfold would lead most viewers to put this in the ""art house"" category, but this categorization would unfairly limit its audience. The ideas it presents and moral dilemmas it raises are interesting and the film does a wonderful job of putting them forward for your consideration rather than trying to bang you over the head with pre-conceived answers. I look forward to the future work of this talented young director.",1400803200,8,1074,4.779569892473118
