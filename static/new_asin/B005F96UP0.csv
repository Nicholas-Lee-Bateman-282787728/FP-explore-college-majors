4673321,4,B005F96UP0,"The sound quality and picture quality were excellent and put out by NBC not China for a change, and the reason it lost a star in rating is because whoever sells this item needs to make aware whoever makes this item that #50 and #58 in the episodes are reversed.

I have this same set and still enjoy watching the Ingall's family and their adventures all the time. Good family shows and lots of fun to watch. Little house was always one of my favorite shows when it was on TV.This is a ""must have"" for any ""Little House"" fan! Thanks",1325203200,,360,4.388059701492537
4673323,4,B005F96UP0,"I bought this at target on Black Friday for $100 (regular price) I've always been a fan of this show and its nice to find episodes rarely aired on hallmark.

It hasn't been remastered (something I'm willing to overlook) unlike the previous complete series set release this one includes the pilot episode movie.

A few things I like:
Price, when some members of my family collected each season they paid upwards of $30 per season and the first season set did not include the pilot movie and you had to shell out an additional $15 for that movie.

The set comes in its own dvd binder, the discs are well protected and it will last for quite some time.

A few things I love:

Price and seeing some episodes rarely seen on Hallmark.
Bonus features

A few things I don't like:

The liner notes are pathetic, it only includes the titles of the episodes with no discriptions. Forcing me to make my own.",1322438400,30,895,4.45398773006135

Like other reviewers have said, there are missing scenes, which will be annoying for die hard fans, but my 9 & 13 year old are enjoying them without knowing what is missing.  The packaging is HORRIBLE.  The plastic cover arrived broken, the box is very flimsy, basically had to repackage all the DVD's into some empty cases I had.

4673382,1,B005F96UP0,"I have the original complete series box set, from 2008. The discs with the episodes are all the exact same ones from the previous individual season sets, and the bonus features are all on the same discs as before. They didn't make any changes at all; same menus, same picture, same sound, same bonus features...same cut down, edited syndication prints of the episodes. Seasons one and two still have the opening titles cut off on all episodes.

The big lure of this box set for me was the inclusion of three discs of brand new bonus features. All the bonus features on those three discs were new to this set, and were dropped when the set was reissued with a lower disc count (when they also dropped the post-series movies as well).

The individual season sets had interviews with Dabbs Greer, Dean Butler, and Alison Arngrim, and Alison also did a few audio commentaries. The three discs of new bonus features had interviews with practically everyone else from the cast who was still alive then, including Merlin Olson, Katherine McGreggor and Richard Bull. Alison Arngrim provided three additional commentaries, and there were a number of video featurettes, including one about the final show: The Last Farewell.

As I upgrade the series to Blu-ray now, I'll be keeping those three bonus feature discs from this box set...as so far, all those bonus features have not been made available anywhere else. (I had hoped it would all go on the Blu-rays, but alas, such was not the case.)",1456358400,,1483,4.78515625

4673405,5,B005F96UP0,"Little House on the Prairie Complete Series, DVD

This consists of all nine seasons of a TV series that was popular not just in America but elsewhere (Petite Maison dans la Prairie). These are based on the six volumes written by Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1930's about her life in the late 19th century. These books provide her personal memories of family life during that time. The usual academic books seldom provide a personal history of ordinary people. The stories in the TV series were dramatized. They could not use real names from that era because of privacy concerns. One book said some of the characters in the novels were composites characters. This doesnt make the stories false. Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote other books. There is a biography about Laura that may interest any fan of the series. These stories tells about life in that era.

Laura wrote about the difference between a dirt floor and a wood floor. The former was warmer in winter, the latter was easier to keep clean. There might be a mention of their water well but no mention of their privy. [I am old enough to remember visiting a relative in a farming area who still had both facilities.] Some reviewers complained about some deleted scenes but did not describe what they were. [I read that a newer version of the movie Jaws used electronic editing to remove the firearms carried by the people. A book about the true event that inspired this novel said people bought and exploded dynamite in the creeks to kill the man-eating shark. In recent times the phrase injured while swimming was used to describe a shark attack at the shore.] If a few scenes were indeed deleted they should not affect the overall story. Do the individual seasons have the complete stories?

The late 19th century saw great changes in America. Immigration increased, the country became industrialized when high tariffs protected and fostered domestic manufacturing. This allowed America to become a first rate world power. People in farming complained and formed political parties and alliances. People in industrialized areas formed unions for economic justice. The wealthy fought them both. These events are not included in these episodes. Unemployed workers migrated in search of work (tramps or hoe boys). The Grapes of Wrath showed another view of rural life. The post-Civil War homestead laws provided land for those who could work and improve these lands. Their crops and cattle provided shipping business for the railroads. The US gave block grants of square miles of land to railroad companies to subsidize their construction and businesses. The overbuilding eventually led to bankruptcies and the disappearance of railroads. European railroads were built to meet government directions and avoided duplication of services. Or so I read in a history book.",1449792000,,2817,5.014957264957265

I have to say that I never noticed any edited pieces missing from the episodes but never watched that close either. However I did notice that some of the episodes, especially in season 3 are out of order on the discs. For instance they show the episode ""The Race"" where Laura wants to race her horse Bunny, when last we saw Bunny had been traded to Mr. Olsen for the stove Laura got her mother for Christmas. They then show the episode ""Bunny"" where Nellie still has Bunny and mistreats her, whipping her. Nellie pretends to be paralyzed in the episode and Laura proves she's not by pushing her wheelchair into a pond.

Harkening back to a simpler time, these are heart warming stories that focus on honesty, integrity, hard work, and good family values in every episode. I think this should be required viewing for everyone, to help them remember what's really important in this life. No doubt there is a certain 'cheesy' factor in many of the episodes, but that can be forgiven. I don't think anyone can watch these episodes without feeling the urge to become a better human being... and you can't ask for more than that.",1418947200,,710,4.733870967741935

I figure that amazon got a bad batch of merchandise from china (most likely Chinese knock-offs) and they dumped them on the public to try to make up the loss.

This won't be an indepth review, as others have done this.  People keep asking, ""Why don't they give us fully unedited seasons!"".  The answer is, in short, not all the film exists for this to happen.  I'm sure in the future they will release better versions of it.

My wife, who grew up watching this, loves this series, and could care less if there are bits missing here and there.  This is the best collection out there, as far as we know.  It was well put together, comes with a nice storage binder and booklet.

4673546,5,B005F96UP0,"I've only watched up to the end of season 8 so far since having purchased this set, and so far all disks have played beautifully. The packaging is great--I love having all the CDs in one case. If I had bought expensive separate seasons, I would have put them into another CD binder anyways, so having them in their own binder/holder is very convenient. The only problems I have are the following:
1. One season of disks was not in the right order, thus causing me to panic a little when I thought I was missing a whole bunch of episodes. But that was momentary when I opened my eyes and actually looked at the numbers. No biggie at all, and I probably shouldnt even mention it, except that it gave me a laugh when I realized I panicked for no reason, hehe.
2. My biggest con is that I worry about the cheap cost of this set, especially when the more 'official' individual seasons sold are so expensive, running from an average of $15-$30 each. I would love to know WHY this seller is able to sell the entire set so cheaply? As I have already stated, I love everything about this set, but I worry about bootlegged work as well. That would be the only reason I considered giving a 4 star rating, but because I love this set, I can't help but give it 5.
Some people have complained there are scenes missing, but unless they have memorized all the episodes, you wouldnt know it if there are, and I would question if those people are right. I also own a copy of the entire 1st season, purchased separately, and its exactly the same as the episodes in this set.. Sometimes the scenes cut off abruptly, then suddenly go to the next, but I think thats just the old fashioned editing that some people are not used to if they didn't live in the 60s and 70s, when tv was classic.
Overall, great set at a fantastic price for a LHOTP fan!",1394409600,,1825,4.292753623188406

daughter growing up. decided to surprise her with
the full nine episodes.
I don't think she will be getting much done for the rest of the yr,
The stories of each episode is a huge experience.
The near tragic events that are always managed by
the families in this country community that is closely knit and
commited to a healthy Christian lifestyle. I think these stories
that are true have so much value in each episode of coping
with rough times and enjoying all the good times
There is an abundance of each---A really great set of stories for all family members.
I liked it so much that I ordered a new one at full price (not used) brand
new. Anyway I purchase it 9 season set. I loved it except
I JUST RECENTLY GOT TO VIEW IT ONLY TO FIND THAT SOME OF THE DVDS ARE A BIT FAULTY
AND STICK OR JUMP AHEAD.SOME WORKED BETTER IF GENTLY WIPED FROM CENTER OUT WITH SOFT CLOTH.
SO FAR ---I HAVE PURCHASED Two 9 SEASON SETS---ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND ONE FOR ME. THIS WAS A LOT OF MONEY and only wish some of them were in better working order.
I still feel the story line and in general-- one of the best of anything I have viewed and wish every family could have the complete set. I wish it was a little
more affordable so that they could.
I see nothing wrong about these stories (from true) that could be offensive and not serve a purpose in a school. They are educational demonstrating lifestyle in early days and with such great moral values. Belva Howard Watkins",1391817600,,1527,4.28719723183391

The sound and picture quality are very good, although I'm watching on a 32"" LCD/LED television and listening in stereo from the TV's built-in speakers.  I am running these from a Home Theater PC, so I can set the file names so that they play in the correct order.  I have noticed some of the episodes are out of order.  I've turned off the Dutch subtitles.  The audio is in English.

As for packaging, these came in plastic cases with six DVDs per case.  These are not in sleeves, but are snapped in to the plastic.

The pilot held our toddlers' full attention because it was full of wild encounters (weather, animal, and human), but the episodes...not as much. The shows deviate from the books a bit and there isn't as much excitement as in the pilot (and Pa's beard is missing on Michael Landon :).

4673563,4,B005F96UP0,"Posted 1-23-2014...  OK, here's the deal, so think before you buy...  LHOTP Season 1 blu-ray will be available late March 2014 with much improved picture & audio quality, remastered, un-cut, in original 4:3 aspect ratio.  I tell you this so that you can think about what you want to do...  Buy the entire DVD set here, at a savings no doubt, but with a number of episodes being cut and not remastered from the original 35mm films (especially from Season 4 onward), or, wait it out, and buy the higher quality blu-ray sets as they become available.  I have already purchased the entire series on DVD (just not all at once like this product), but will gladly buy the blu-ray sets when they come out.  I can't say that for most other shows I've already bought on DVD, but I can with this one.  The series is that good, as it was beautifully filmed, and is worthy of watching in the highest possible quality on a large HDTV (I prefer plasma, 50 inch+).

Do an AMAZON SEARCH for ""Little House on the Prairie Season 1 (Deluxe Remastered Edition Blu-ray + UltraViolet Digital Copy)"" in order to find the Season 1 blu-ray, and do a search for more seasons from time to time, as they will likely be released before long.  Also be sure to check out tvshowsondvd.com for detailed press releases concerning the Season 1 blu-ray and upcoming releases.

4673571,3,B005F96UP0,"There is absolutely no complaint regarding Little House... It's entertainment value continues to stand the test of time.

My issue is with the quality or the discs and packaging. First of all, the discs all come in plastic sleeves tucked into cardboard ""half"" folders so the discs easily fall out of their correct folder. The folders are all on a three ring binder which do not flip well to get from season to season (again, the discs love to fall out while you must flip them). Additionally, the weight of all the discs in their folders are too heavy for the three ring binder and my binder ripped from the lager exterior case. SO... not only do the discs all fall out, but the binder falls out too. So if the set gets jostled in the slightest everything goes spilling out!, YUCK!

My other BIG issue is that the discs will not play on my laptop, only in a dvd player hooked up to a television. Several of the discs have many many ""skips"" and most of those skips cause the disc to completely stop playing mid episode (or mid movie). There are absolutely no scratches on the discs, so the issue must stem from its poor manufacturing. I also received 2 of the same discs in my set and had to contact the production disc to get the correct disc to complete my set.

Overall, its a lot of work and disappointment for an awful lot of money. What a shame since the show is so amazing.",1389225600,2,1379,4.337209302325581

4673582,5,B005F96UP0,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.
 So far Ive bought DVDs of forty shows. Ive found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.
No issues with Little House on the Prairie, however. After watching many reruns of all of the great shows, I now consider Little House to be the greatest of all, in a close call with Touched by an Angel.
Michael Landon, a genius in all facets of TV  acting, directing, script writing, producing  was the mastermind behind Little House. The greatness of the show is evinced in the enduring camaraderie of cast members at reunions. Who could have thought that antagonists Laura Ingalls (Melissa Gilbert) and Nellie Olson (Alison Arngrim) in real life were close friends?
This show had the best acting, most interesting and inspirational story lines, clever comedy, serious drama, and the best mood music of all-time.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners.

I haven't seen the whole series in order, until my husband bought the entire series for  me as a gift. Great show that teaches good values and can easily relate to many of the characters. But like others have said, there are scenes that are cut from episodes. But it's just a few second scenes that don't alter the story in anyway and don't leave out anything important. Anyway there still good.",1378425600,,478,4.431818181818182

About 2-3 months ago Amazon offered a Complete LHOP set which had the individual seasons packaging and included the LHOP movie collection package for about $140.00.

4673626,5,B005F96UP0,"I had to purchase the pilot separately because it was not included. The pilot is very important to the story and should have been built right into the box set. The covered wagon box set is totally cute, but the three-ring binding design needs some improvement. The discs slide so much even when you're being careful and when you turn to the next disc you have to make sure to push the disc back into its pocket or you risk scratching or breaking it. For this reason alone I will never loan it out even to the most careful person. Now to the show; I love the show. Every family should watch this show together. Yes it's old. Yes the quality doesn't hold up to today's standards. And yes (when we got a better TV and DVD player this was even more obvious and necessary as the depth in color and everything else became more clear) the show needs to be digitally remastered. Also there are a couple of episodes out of order (the ones with Laura and Nellie and Laura's/Nellie's horse) very confusing the first time through the episode thinking you must have skipped an episode until you see the next episode when you realize that you just watched them out of order through no fault of your own. Aside from not being perfect, and even if you do have to purchase the pilot separately and take extra care to protect the discs, I highly recommend this show and watch it often for it's wholesome quality and pure entertainment. The extra interviews and bonus material are fun and informative, as well! Read this, know what to expect, and enjoy the show for what it is! It makes a great gift for all ages, and my manly husband loves watching it with me - he originally did everything he could to avoid it, but then he realized how great it really was and now he loves how old school and challenging the times were. Seriously, you should buy this and keep it forever! Thanks for reading - full pint please!",1369094400,3,1894,4.414285714285715

You really should look into getting this fixed cause a lot of people would buy this if in fact it was UNCUT AND UNEDITED. The true fans of the show will notice in a minute if something is missing. The price you are charging for this set is way to high since scenes episodes and season ten is not included. One person had a review take out the scene selections part of the dvd if this is why everything is edited If you ever get this problem fixed I will buy but not until then.

We've checked at Internet Movie Data Base for the correct ordered and skipped around on a few to make them flow better.  If you don't, some of the episodes don't make good sense.  The audio has been good.  We do have to turn the volume up more than normal, but we can hear everything fine.  There has been a few lines and fuzziness in the picture, but not often and not enough to take away from the viewing pleasure.

They are difficult to get in and out, and it is easy to forget which dvd you watched last unless you look at the booklet that outlines the seasons and episodes.  I felt the dvds were packaged very cheaply.  One dvd had to be cleaned because it was skipping during an episode, which makes  me wonder if it was a returned item.

The only ones I know of (for a fact) that are NOT cut/edited are the ones on Amazon.de called ""Kleine Huis Op De Prairie"". They have English audio so there's no need to worry about making a purchase. There are also some with the title ""Unsere kleine Farm"", but I have not personally seen them & cannot comment on if they are cut/edited or not (or if they have English audio or not). I have the ""Kleine Huis Op De Prairie"" versions so again, I can 100% confirm that they are NOT edited and DO have English audio.

No idea why other countries can get 100% uncut episodes, while the US get's this garbage.",1327363200,145,684,4.34375
4673642,3,B005F96UP0,"Many of the dvd's in this set are missing scenes from the series. For example, when the blind school catches on fire, Hester Sue goes to check on the tea kettle before she finds the smoke coming from the basement door.  Also, one of the blind children is awakened because he is snoring and he goes to the bathroom to blow his nose.  He then becomes stuck in the bathroom because the door won't open. That is why Mrs. Garvey had to go back and rescue him, resulting in her and baby Adam's death. These scenes are completely cut from the dvd.  I found this out because someone had uploaded the full episodes on youtube and I realized when I rewatched my dvd's that certain scenes were missing.  There were other episodes that were the same way but this is the one that sticks out in my mind.  If I am going to spend money on dvd's, I expect them to be full and unedited.  After all, it's not like they had to be edited for commercials.  I cannot find the full episodes on youtube now (I found this out a couple of years ago after I had bought the dvd set years before).  I was told the unedited dvd's were sold in France.  Just know when you buy these that you are not getting the full, unedited episodes.",1326153600,282,1203,4.218340611353712
