1985332,5,B0001A79DK,"This film is a masterpiece because of the way it challenges viewers: it refuses to be mere escapist entertainment as so many movies are.  It bleakly confronts the way the legacy of the holocaust in Germany and the alienation of modern capitalism have turned people into soulless machines: love is impossible, a real life of honest emotion becomes unlivable.  The main character, Elvira Weishaupt, is a lonely, forgotten soul who is kicked around and ignored by the rest of the world; what gives her life meaning is that she once loved someone passionately enough to change her entire life and identity for him, which, nonetheless, did not make any difference at all.  Fassbinder mourns, in this film, the violent mysterious deaths of two previous lovers, El Hedi Ben Salem and Armin Meier; he bears witness to the crushing collapse of the utopian dreams of free love and personal liberation that marked the 1960's.  This is one of Fassbinder's most intellectual films (Schopenhauer, Kafka and Sartre are all explicitly referenced) but it's also one of his most human and heartfelt, using great music (Mahler, Roxy Music, Connie Francis) to express the bittersweet longings of the main character.  This is a nihilist statement that can actually make people appreciate life -- Utopia is what we all make of it, and everyone is an ""outsider"" in one way or another.",1104969600,13,1361,4.977973568281938
1985333,5,B0001A79DK,"This is the film that really showed a dramatic turning point in Fassbinder's career.. Although the movie contains many of Fassbinder's previous ideas it presents them in a completely new light.. Greatly influenced by the personal events in his life (mainly the death of Armin Meyer) - the film shows probably the most diverse emotions of any fassbinder movie.. Overwhelming sadness dominates the beginning of the film until it reaches an almost spiritual explosion in the slaughterhouse scene.. Fassbinder would also use this metaphor in Berlin Alexanderplatz (in a more biblical fashion).. the film later goes through many other emotional turnings - comedy, paranoia, and an almost Kafka like dream quality.. Fassbinder finally proves with this movie that he has fully transcended the medium of melodrama.. this is finally something completely new and his own.. Acting as cameraman, director, writer, co-editor, and numerous other tasks - this clearly a project fassbinder had to make for himself.. and it shows us a man turned completely inside out.. not many artists have accomplished this kind of feat..",1082246400,4,1107,5.331428571428572
8009400,5,B0001A79DK,"In a Year With 13 Moons is, without question, the most emotionally devastating of all the Fassbinder  films. The newcomer will often see that this work is relegated to the `lesser' category by critics, ranked far behind the BRD trilogy, the massive Berlin Alexanderplatz, as well as the melodramas Ali: Fear Eats the Soul and The Merchant of Four Seasons. As a matter of fact, it is probably the most casually omitted of any movie in his catalog. The reasons why I can venture to guess. The film has an inherent strangeness that exists separately from the depressing or pessimistic themes other reviewers have already mentioned. It looks forward to Querelle in its almost otherworldly use of color. It abandons Sirkian narrative for something more often associated with Fellini: a descent into personal loss, the past, and the blurry point where fantasy and reality intersect. That last bit is important, I think, because 13 moons is one of a handful of great films with dream logic as its backbone. Fassbinder was at a point in his life where structure necessarily ceded to more organic rhythms, to the jumble of the psyche. Like Fellini's late masterpiece City of Women (which I hold in even higher regard than 8 ) it is an unbridled vision in the best and most complimentary sense of the word. Every ounce of its director is on every frame.

Regret permeates, and so that is where comparisons to City of Women End. If there is a playfulness here at times, and there certainly is, then it has more to do with the absurdity of living than with any kind of buoyancy or optimism. One of the most famous scenes from this movie has Erwin/Elvira reconnecting with Anton Saitz in his luxurious but now vacant business offices. An awkward and grotesque musical number ensues, in which a band of Saitz' cohorts follow his movements because they have nothing better to do. This pops up again and again in Elvira's encounters. The troubled spirits she runs into seem to inhabit a city that is only marginally real, until somehow it no longer feels like we're contained geographically, but rather floating in a void where life once happened but is happening no more. It is as harrowing as they come, this film, and equally as beautiful. It is also my favorite Fassbinder work, and not only by a little bit. To those of you reading who want to avoid all things despairing, please remember the words of the late, great Baudelaire:

""I can barely conceive of a type of beauty in which there is no melancholy.""",1360195200,,2496,4.720183486238532
8009401,5,B0001A79DK,My first exposure to Fassbinder and probably one of his bests.  This movie is devastating and introspective dealing with difficult and thoughtful themes.,1351036800,,153,5.6521739130434785
8009402,3,B0001A79DK,"Like all Fassbinder films I've seen, it's unpredictable, honest, and revealing.  It gets the third star simply for an entirely new character like Erwin/Elvira. But what is the message here?  Some people are hopelessly damaged?  Reach out a helping hand even though it's futile?  What are the feelings that led him to get the sex change?  What was the real history of Erwin and Anton? How were his wife and daughter so entirely irrelevant?  What gave him this emotional connection to this old business partner that no one else did?  What were his hopes, dreams, or regrets?

If you're going to create such a fringe character to draw out the themes of emotional pain, lonliness, and isolation, the audience needs to know more about him than a horrible childhood history and vague clingy instincts to anyone who shows any kind of approval.  I have no doubt that people this broken and desperate exist.  I just feel they would have more to express.  The early cattle slaughterhouse scene goes on WAY too long.  We GET the symbolism of mutilation and doom.  Reinforcing this more is like strapping the viewer to a torture table. Fassbender's Eva Braun and Petra Van Kant showed us infinitely more about themselves.",1307664000,,1209,4.839024390243902
8009403,4,B0001A79DK,"Is this the most aesthetically balanced and lush of Fassbinder's films? Perhaps. In a Year of 13 Moons is a singularly unique study of a transvestite's slow and painful disintegration. Through an interplay of comic self-consciousness and oblique representations of the tragic, Fassbinder's characters manage to radiate above the surface of his simple schema. Also, there are extraordinary passages of internal narration-in particular at the slaughterhouse. This film claws its way around its material and culminates with a magnificent resolution of its tragic elements.",1279497600,,569,5.785714285714286
8009404,4,B0001A79DK,"It is a story of a semi-orphaned bi-sexual boy having a daughter fathered just to ""change gender"" in Morocco to unsuccessfully please a co-student-millionaire with dare consequences for a male in a woman body - and vice versa.

Given the time of producing, legal grounds for such metamorphosis are unclear even nowadays.

8009405,5,B0001A79DK,"I initally saw this in a really poor VHS transfer from New Yorker Video, but obviously, the DVD is much better.  This, along with Berlin Alexanderplatz, are my favorites of Fassbinder's work.  There is such a strange, haunting quality to this film, from the early strains of Mahler's 5th symphony, 4th movement at the beginning (which is one of the most majestic pieces ever recorded, and one of my favorite symphonies that moves me to tears at times) that haunts the film to the very end.  Even though it's about a transgender woman being jilted by her lover (the man she got the sex change for), her struggle for love is universal, which is why you can identify with it so strongly.  It's incredibly sad, yet funny in spots too (much like life).  It's one of Fassbinder's most complex films (which is saying something), and certainly one of his top 5 films.  He made over 40 features in a 13 year time span (including miniseries and shorts), and he would probably be still going today if he didn't die of a drug overdose.  I miss the ambition and the deep artistry of Rainer, whose films still haunt me (and us) today.

The DVD has some excellent interviews with those who worked on this film and with Rainer on many occasions.  They talk about him with great feeling as if he were still alive today (in many ways, he is, as his work lives on).  But you can skip Richard Linklater's tedious, self indulgent, and completely unrehearsed introduction.  Linklater says a few interesting things, but he ends up coming across like a film professor who doesn't really understand Fassbinder's film except from an academic, overly intellectual point of view, and he talks about himself WAY too much.",1190419200,2,1692,4.6824324324324325

8009407,5,B0001A79DK,"The movie should have been called ""Despair"" had Fassbinder himself not made the film with that title just before ""In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden"" (1978) which was very personal for the writer/director who had to come to terms with his lover's suicide. This drama follows the last few days in the life of Elvira - Erwin Weisshaupt. Several years back, Ervin underwent the sex change operation in hopes to win love of the man he loved. It did not help him to make Anton love him and it did not make him happier. It may sound beautiful, ""I'll do anything for love, I'll be anything you want me to be"" but by trying to be someone else, a person simply loses his/her own identity, becomes lonely and desperate and has no way out.

The movie is the most touching, moving, powerful and devastating Fassbinder ever made - it is impossibly difficult to watch at times but it does not make it a bad movie. The acting is fantastic by everyone; the directing is tight and Fassbinder is always in control taking movie from its melodramatic roots to the heights of pure tragedy, never been over-sentimental and even providing some humor. The choice of music with the references to ""Death in Venice"" (eternal and never fulfilled longing) and to Fellini's ""Amarcord"" (looking back at one's life trying to find the roots in the childhood, to understand how and why the things happened the way they did) makes the film even more compelling.

Warning: there is a scene in the slaughterhouse which is almost unbearable to watch. It is the very important scene but be prepared for it. It does not spare any details of the job done and in its emotional impact is as horrifying as ""The Blood of the Beasts"" (1949), the short documentary by Georges Franju.",1170806400,,1729,4.6103896103896105
8009408,5,B0001A79DK,"Just only a very few filmmakers in cinema ' s story have had the supreme virtue of treat th human being with such load of affection, respect and indulgency no matter the circumstances of religious, social, racial or psychological orders we talk.

Fassbinder literally embraced and loved the human being, and he dared to present many unsaid realities of universal repercussions. This awful and penetrating movie deals around a sex change of a man who tries to please his male lover, and then to be abandoned and deal with this stigma against the world.

An awful and incisive film which demands all your possible attention. It is not an easy going picture which anticipated itself by far to many actual issues.",1142294400,,709,4.851239669421488
8009409,5,B0001A79DK,"Yes this film is full of hard-to-watch scenes like the slaughterhouse sequence, but what has not been mentioned is the wit and humor of the piece. Beginning with the openning scene in which a bunch of hustlers beat up the heroine because she is not a gay man, Fassbinder pulls a series of reversals and twists on what is expected. There are also amusing visual incongruities such as Elvira and Zora in their full femme outfits visiting slaughterhouses and convents.

The strong emotional impact of this film cannot be separated from Fassbinder's usual humor, which puts the character's pain into a larger perspective.",1139961600,2,617,4.990291262135922
