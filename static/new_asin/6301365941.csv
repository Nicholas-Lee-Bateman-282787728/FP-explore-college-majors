Of the two gifts under the tree that year this was by far my favorite. The previous commentator obviously lacks the amount of class and knowledge it takes to understand this beautiful work of art. I would rate it up there with Schindler's List and Finding Nemo. It may possibly be my new favorite film of all time, other than the obvious choice of Steel Magnolias. The comparison that I made in my final paper for film class was between the death of Julia Roberts and Skull's final vengeance.",1376352000,,647,4.445378151260504
8451050,1,6301365941,My friends and I tried watching this based on the awesome cover that features some bald mouth-breather with an eye-patch and shotgun. Not redeemable on any level--unless you're looking for some softcore.,1202947200,,203,5.375
