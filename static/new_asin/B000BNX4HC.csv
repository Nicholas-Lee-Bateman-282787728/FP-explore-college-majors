8089588,2,B000BNX4HC,"The first item covered is ""be aware of your surroundings"" that alone can make all the difference.
In the begining of the video, he teaches a very good move that can enable you to get away if you are being held from behind, like a bear hug.  This move alone is a good reason to buy the video, however, most of the rest teaches moves that would help you if your drunk friend or family member wants a fight. He doesn't focus as much on wounding your opponet, mostly just stopping them or creating distance, that's why I only gave it 3 stars.",1269216000,2,538,4.223300970873787
8089589,5,B000BNX4HC,"""Easy Techniques for Self Defense"" is an excellent primer/introduction for the general populace on how to defend against attacks. The DVD breaks down attacks from every angle: attacks from the front, from the back, ground fighting as well as defense against knife and gun attacks. The beauty of this system is its simplicity. Gene Simco uses what he calls the ""common denominator"" method, which means using one technique for a variety of attacks. The result is that you have to learn just a few basic moves to defend yourself. Other self-defense systems are much more complicated.

Finally, I disagree wit the previous reviewer that stated this DVD is not suitable for women, older people etc. This is categorically not true. Simco states in the DVD that these methods are very suitable for women and people with limited strength against a stronger opponent, even giving an example of an attack in a possible rape situation.

It is a great start at self-defense and if this is all you ever learn, it should be enough to disarm an attacker and allow you to flee and regain our safety.",1240012800,2,1083,4.817204301075269
8089590,3,B000BNX4HC,"Unfortunately, this is based on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which has become very popular with young males over the last few years and is similiar to wrestling.

While there is nothing wrong with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, its not a system that small females or older individuals tend to do well in. I have reservations about martial arts that require strength, flexibility or years of training, unless of course, you have the time and the inclination to do this.

Personally, I would recommend something from the Israeli fighting systems because they are 1. Easy to learn. 2. Easy to remember and 3. Don't require knowledge of submission holds and ground grappling.

For easy self-defense, check out Krav Maga or anything by Paul Vunak.",1171756800,22,723,5.0588235294117645
8089591,5,B000BNX4HC,"The first time I have seen a minimalist approach to defense in a high stress environment, using a few simple techniques for multiple attacks and focusing on applications for different types of athletic abilities. A realistic attitude was presented in admitting the unpractical-ness of elaborate techniques presented elsewhere, and due seriousness given when dealing with armed attacks. Overall, Mr Simco is friendly and patient with his instruction, with good video editing, use of effects and camera work. My compliments to Mr. Simco's assistant Nick, who patiently endures being the 'punching bag' in the demonstrations! Beware of the choppy start of the video and be aware of the law enforcement focus of the 2nd half of the video,'restraining techniques' if a private citizen. A refreshingly honest and useful presentation!",1165795200,11,827,5.46875
8089592,5,B000BNX4HC,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Simco shows some awesome wrist locks with great explanations. The DVD was a success because I watched it with a partner and followed along. I converted many of them into one-step sparring techniques that look pretty sharp. I am very pleased with this self-defense DVD, the instructor is extremely knowledgeable about the subject material and it is a no nonsense DVD that gets right to the heart of strategy. Great tool!",1163030400,17,459,4.822784810126582
