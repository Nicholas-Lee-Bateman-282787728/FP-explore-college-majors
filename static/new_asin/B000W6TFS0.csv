8221347,5,B000W6TFS0,My son loves baby first and we had to get rid of direct tv bc of problems. My only wish was it was longer and not as expensive,1345161600,,126,3.5357142857142856
8221348,5,B000W6TFS0,This channel showed up one day on my cable package so i tried it out. WOW! the shows are such simple concepts with bright colors and tons of songs to keep your little one very interested. They are short shows so that they don't get bord and leave. My 22month and 4month olds both love the shows. My 22month old adores hide & seek and peekaboo. We all sing along with the characters and most are interactive. I keep this channel on all day but don't have cable in the kids room so that's why i bought this dvd. Highly recommend this to anyone with kids,1341619200,,551,4.2075471698113205
8221349,2,B000W6TFS0,"I bought this dvd mainly for the Fred and Fiona and Harry the Bunny. My son loves both of them, but doesn't care too much for the other stuff. I wish each show had it's own dvd.",1285891200,,177,3.810810810810811
8221350,5,B000W6TFS0,"The BabyFirst TV series is wonderful.  They are made up of several short and educational cartoons.  My son is now 9 months old and has loved this series since he was about 6 months old, and these cartoons are the only ones that really hold my son's attention.  I don't mind letting him watch them as long as he wants because they are so visually and conceptually stimulating.  I imagine all of the wires connecting and wheels spinning in his little brain.  I think the best thing about them is that the individual cartoons only last a couple of minutes, then they move on to another cartoon.  My son doesn't get bored with them because they're constantly changing.  He loves the characters so much, and they make him giggle.  I cannot say enough about this series.  Not to mention, it allows me to get a few chores done around the house.  I laugh while I'm working because I can hear my baby giggling in the family room.  I don't feel guilty AT ALL when he's having that much fun and learning at the same time.",1270684800,,1010,4.405405405405405
8221351,5,B000W6TFS0,"This is a great dvd for babies.  My daughter was actively responding to the shows, and I'm pretty sure she really was learning. I've tried some of the other brands and they seem to soothe her or keep her quiet but they don't seem very educational.  They have a whole line of these dvds, each has a different subject.  This one has some great characters and lessons that seem simple enough for her to understand.",1201564800,,411,4.453333333333333
