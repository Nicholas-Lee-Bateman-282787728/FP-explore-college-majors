3457628,2,B001AQO3WY,"You have to give the creators of GENERATION KILL --Just LOVE that title-- credit. They did an amazing job making a great recrutement show. It is seriously needed now more than ever. It must be assumed the military gave it's full support in the making of this HBO production. Watching GENERATION KILL it should be clear to most viewers being in the Marines means being in a brotherhood, something so many young men are desperate for, and it sure looks like a lot of fun. That GENERATION KILL shows *some* bad stuff that can happen to our ""boys"" over there only serves to make it all the more exciting. This is where you can be somebody, be part of a group, and be a real man. All those people back home just don't get it and they never will. They have been through something more real, something deeper, something so much more meaningful than anything they could experience back home. If you murder innocent people, don't worry, you were ""just doing your job"".

EDIT (01-04-09):
I forgot to add that the the soldier's sunglasses are cool on the GENERATION KILL cover.",1219190400,5,1066,4.5811518324607325
3457629,5,B001AQO3WY,"This show is fantastic, gritty, scary, funny, shocking and all the other adjectives used to desribe it in other reviews.  However, you don't have to be in the military or a vet to appreciate it.  Basically, if you liked shows like Band of Brothers and Over There, you will love this.  It's a very real picture of what has gone on in the middle east on the presonal level, not the political.  It's entertaining in an sociological and educational way, along with just being a great show.  And, once again, it doesn't require having a past experience of shooting at brown or yellow people.

Simply Fudge, or is it Silly Fun, no wait it's Semper Fi, there, now I can enjoy this show... actually I like fudge better.

After episode 6 I was so hooked that I went on to watch all of the footage shows on HBO regarding the real Marines, the filming in Africa, about the writer, etc... I'm hooked. Yes, it's brutal, yes, it's very frank, and yes, it's sometimes hilarious... just like life. Huge props for these amazing men and to the man who brought their story to us.

3457631,5,B001AQO3WY,"This HBO series is unbelievable.  It captured the true meaning of being in the military.  The political internal battle is captured with great affects.  The series reflects the bond soldiers build with each other that no civilian can EVER experience.  This is way we bond for a lifetime and fight for our country. This is the military and a warrior in action on every level.

The writers, producers and actors did an outstanding performance in capturing the truth.

Brilliant HBO Series on the good/bad of danger-close combat .. ..

For those who say this series is 'sad' and/or horrific, it is to a small extent, but that is what warfare brings and the innocent will always die with the guilty .. .. It is unavoidable .. .. Yet, far more innocents die in peacetime - Think Darfur and North Korea .. ..

As for the characters portrayed in the series - Did you feel some were unsavory and/or a bit warped?? Well .. ..Have you ever been in a HS/College/Pro sports locker room? Enough said .. ..

In the end, it takes a SPECIAL person to place yourself in harm's way, and an even MORE SPECIAL person to join the Corps .. ..

3457637,5,B001AQO3WY,"""Generation Kill"" is the sort of inside look into the US Military I have long looked for.  It reminds me of Karl Marlante's Vietnam book ""Matterhorn"" which did a similar thing for the Vietnam era US Marines (and should have spawned something on the screen by now).  Unsparing in frankness, the various episodes display all the follies of command, individual cowardice, cruelty, compassion, true incompetence, individual heroism, true professionalism, love and devotion to duty and country that the Marines and our military are known for.  The acting performances are stunningly realistic and, at times it feels like watching a documentary. The Marine Corps trains its members to be coldblooded killers, but in an insurgency warfare situation this mindset may be a handicap.  How these soldiers must have grappled with this conundrum is shown here in graphic and unvarnished detail. I salute this series and only wish there was a second season showing the War of Occupation and more.",1519430400,,982,5.19620253164557

Not sure where all the 5 stars are coming from but this was so boring. Half the time, I didn't understand what was going on, what they were talking about or why they were doing what they were doing. The leaders were incompetent. None of the characters were likable except maybe Ray. I don't care if there's not a lot of action but there should still be substance. This had none of that. Lastly, apparently men are pigs when they see a female marine and it's absolutely disgusting.

3457659,4,B001AQO3WY,"It was typical of HBO-  it has its strong leftwing tones that make it almost unbearable at times, but if you can endure it (like I have become professional at) it is worth watching. The show was also made before the Obama era liberals really got hold of the media, so the worst you have to endure is the leftwing fantasy version of white American males, the typical HBO Bill Mahr anti-Christian stuff and one ultra annoying minority soldier who relentlessly talks about white American oppression. For the most part it was a depiction of American soldiers who spearheaded the invasion of Iraq. Regardless of how exact the plot was with respect to reality, it gives you an idea of what happened and how the chain of command works. I've read reviews from soldiers who said they were in Iraq who don't agree with the depictions of the soldiers in the show so you have to take the characters with a grain of salt (skepticism). I liked enough of the characters, which out-weighed how I felt about the annoying ones, which allowed me to keep watching it. I also liked the portrayals of the tactics and problems the military faced in Iraq- such as; the revelations of the officers who prove either talented or inept as the soldiers get tested in combat. Also interesting was to see the pressure on green officers and what they go through to try and become leaders.",1506211200,,1356,4.603305785123967

Those that pushed north the first few weeks are the ones that know, you won't here them cry about camera angles or all the cussing that went on. The fact that even the writer of the book and movie was part of the movie and his history, I give much respect for sharing his view of the war in Iraq.

I liked this series and I will probably watch it again in the future. I am intrigued by how badly the officers managed the troops and also how the rule of engagement constantly changed. It is scary how some of the officers like Captain America, were portrayed in the series. He appeared to be useless and a real mental case.

I never served in Iraq or Afghanistan, so there is contextual stuff and some cultural things that I didn't personally experience.  But that doesn't mean I didn't have some acute sensory recall while watching it (I've trained in the desert, but never went downrange).  The scenes inside the humvees were particularly nostalgic for me.  Just hearing the distinctive rumble of the engine and some of the things rattling around inside brought back the feeling of the thick heat, the stale, musty smell of the canvas seats....  The scene where the reporter dons his mask during their first SCUD attack and flops around in his overboots, I've seen that very thing during gas drills in training, and that scene made me laugh my head off.  Another small tough I particularly liked, especially as a former radio operator (RTO), was the radio chatter that bookended each episode, recorded from the actual comms from the Marines that were there.

As has been mentioned, the book is definitely a must-read as well, and the two together will give you a great picture of what it means to be a ground-level fighter and leader in a real situation.",1487894400,12,1292,4.706666666666667

3457746,5,B001AQO3WY,"Honestly, words cannot express how much I enjoyed this show. I don't watch movies based around war often, they're just usually not the type of shows/movies I can get into easily, but I bulldozed my way through this entire season. I highly recommend watching it. The humor and horror of the things happening contrast each other well. The character development is interesting to see as the show goes on. The pacing of the episodes overall are great, and each one offers up another thing to reflect on about war in general. It was nice to see a show that also made its soldiers ""human"". They're not callous and flat. They want to fight but they have brains, and they acknowledge the weird things that happen in war that don't happen on a normal day. They openly speak about the contradictions between living in America and having a job were killing someone is almost rejoiced. They have their moments were things get to them, but at the same time they keep going because it's their job to do what they're doing.

I think this series is also based off of a book too - told from the reporters point of view? So overall I think they put the entire series together well.",1485820800,4,1163,4.511848341232228

3457749,4,B001AQO3WY,"An interesting look from a soldiers perspective. War is never easy or clean: it's a messy and destructive affair and should never be entered into for purely political reasons. The makers of this film series do a good job of portraying the gamut of human personalities with their motivations and fears as they enter into, and then experience armed conflict. Those who had been hiding behind a false sense of identity or purpose, find that they are not who they thought they were. While those who know their duty, and are true to their character, are left fighting the enemy within their ranks, as they attempt to execute the orders of their superiors.",1485820800,,650,4.761061946902655

Colbert, Nate and Doc are my favorite ""characters"" and I love the little tidbits of 90's music sung by the soldiers.  I work with Persian/Gulf War veterans but am not a veteran myself.

3457917,4,B001AQO3WY,"The problems began before they were mobilized. Donald Rumsfeld listened to his civilian people whose best interest was money. He was told that the forces we had were enough to conquer Iraq. General Shinseki who as a General was Qualified to understand what was actually going on. He tried to explain that there was not enough military, I believe he said 2 divisions short of what was needed. He understood the difference between taking a city versus maintaining it. Think back two WWII there were 4 sectors divided by the US.,France,England and russia. There was enough
military to setup police stations, hospitals and helping to restore what was necessary. I applaud General Shinseki for trying his best to make Rumsfeld understand. Then motivation was simply about money. It was a fact that Saddam paid the families that blew themselves up against Israel.
Fact 2 The terrorist who masterminded the attack on the Achille laurel was given safe haven in Iraq as well as others. While we attempted to repair the water,sewage,electricity there were people who sole mission was to destroy what was built. U.S. and it's agencies passed out us currency as if it was just paper. I was there during the year of 2003 and spent the entire next year at cough""Walter Reed"" Even though the post commander stated that we had priority when it came to being seen, such was not the case. The pay system was completely broken, every month I would file the paperwork to show that I am no longer in a combat zone and should not be receiving combat pay. Meanwhile soldiers in Medhold couldn't get any money for their family to pay their bills. One of my soldiers had not been paid for 6 months. Every formation I went to the 1sgt to try and get things
strait for my soldiers to no avail. I was there when Pvt Lynch was treated as a queen during her time there. Meanwhile the other soldier who was
actually trying to save them was shot I believe 4 times. Pvt Lynch was given %100 percent disability and became America's hero. As I understand it the soldier that was trying to protect lynch while she was hiding in the well of the deuce or 5 ton got 0%. Why because there was no lingering problems and therefore she needed to go to the V.A. During that year 2004 I saw and heard of soldiers getting 0% meanwhile officers had it made.
I was there when Michael Moore interviewed some of the medhold soldiers and the twisted results on tv. I've spent 22 years in the Army some active duty and rest as a reservist. It is a known fact that Active duty looks down upon Reservist. They do not understand that we are trained constantly to be able to step right in a unit if they need us. Spit in our face and kick us in the ass was the norm for Active duty officers of Medhold. Did we find weapons of Mass destruction, we saw the components of it. When I asked my LT. how come it isn't brought out, I was told that what we found
were items illegally sold to Iraq and we will use this as a trump card when necessary. Since coming home I have had 2 cases of pneumonia which is treated by Levofloxacin which if you look it up is also used to treat Antrax. Yes I tool all six shots and walked into a bunker (3) of us and immediately
began to experience the systems. We got out as fast as possible. The Major at the Cash unit called Ft. Richie and was told if we are still living to give us fresh air and monitor our conditions. The refused to tell the Major what we came in contact with. Such were the perils of military serving the
people of U.S.A. frag out",1483401600,,3523,4.388379204892966
3457918,5,B001AQO3WY,Being a Marine who never got to go to war wouldnt know anything about that part.

""Generation Kill"" is NOT your grandfather's war.  It is not ""The Pacific"" or ""Band of Brothers"".  It embodies the dysfunction of today's military, a military made up of - mostly poor - volunteers who simply want to get ahead in life led by an officer corps that is made up of preening perfumed eunuchs who are only interested in the advancement of their careers.

3458274,5,B001AQO3WY,"A great portrait of the life of Marines at the tip of the spear, leading the invasion of Iraq. Some veterans of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are a little turned off by this series- not because of any bloodiness as the action is not of the buckets of blood like Saving Private Ryan. It's the day-to- day grind, the lack of sleep, and especially the politics and infighting amongst the officers that gets under their skin. For the chickensh*t is the main part of this show though there are plenty of fight scenes. That's probably why I like it. I went through all that crap in the Army back in the 1990s and it almost drove me up the wall. With the perspective of time I can now watch a show like this and chuckle at how dumb and petty a lot of officers really are.",1481155200,,774,4.201342281879195

3458376,2,B001AQO3WY,"Too much Hollywood liberal Leftist ideas inserted into it. Hollywood hates the South, which is why the liberal writer portrayed the master sergeant from the South as a nutcase infatuated with dress regulations. In reality, during WWII bootcamps, southerners were often separated from recruits that were from the big cities because they knew the southerners already knew how to shoot, and follow a map and understood how to navigate terrain.

Iraq's portrayed as some special fighting force hard to reckon with is also a Hollywood writer's myth. Iraqi soldiers were giving up to journalists when the land war began, which was barely covered within one episode.

The episode with mocking the Black Christian chaplain was uncalled for, but obvious par for unbelieving Jews to mock. What was funny, was how Iceman went on a tirade against the chaplain being just one more mouth to feed because of being a ""pog"" (persons other than grunts), which was simply an anti-religious rant of stupidity, when it has been the faith of God's people that won the past wars fought by the USMC.

When I saw it avail on Amazon Video I decided I'd forgotten enough in 8 years to watch it again. I think the banter between James Ransone and Alexander Skarsgard alone is worth watching. I have no idea how well they got along during the shooting but they did a great job playing off 1 another and the dialogue was fantastic at times. I thought various other character actors were really well cast too (the master sergeant's tirades are hilarious). The idea that these young, trained, killing machines rolled into Iraq completely out of their element at times and frequently led astray by SOME of their commanding officers is troubling and fascinating to watch, let alone the constantly changing policies on the rules of engagement.  It's a Hollywood production but I assume some of the portrayals & situations are reasonably accurate since it's based on a book by a Rolling Stone reporter who was embedded w/the battalion (and I assume this Rolling Stone reporter was mostly accurate in his storytelling).

3458657,5,B001AQO3WY,"A ""home movie"" of the first few weeks of Operation Iraqi Freedom as seen through the eyes of recon Marines.  You get it all, the good, the bad and the really ugly.  You might wonder, ""do they really act that way and say those things?"".  The answer is yes.  I was with the Army and not the Marine Corps, but the general sentiment is the same.  You've got to remember, these are young men far away from home, trained to kill yet trying to hide their insecurities.  Most are still immature, as might be expected of anyone else their age.  The unindoctrinated will cringe a bit when they hear the kinds of things coming out of the mouths of our troops.  War is not genteel.

Are the officers as dull-witted and ineffective as they are portrayed here?  No, usually they are not. I would go as far to say very rarely. Evan Wright, who helped write the series, and wrote the book that the series is based upon, insists he is just writing what he observed.  The interaction and dialogue between characters of all levels is spot on.

If you want to get an idea of what you've ""missed"" if you were not involved in the first days of the second Gulf War, watch all seven episodes of Generation Kill.  It will give you a small sampling of what our vets had to do and endure...and what they now live with. ",1471824000,19,1292,4.3070539419087135

3458745,5,B001AQO3WY,"Having served with the Marines in combat, I easily picked up on how Marines manage to keep perspective of what they're doing in the high stress situation of trying to stay alive, even through the mass confusion of war, and the fact that officers are not always as smart as they're supposed to be. Sometimes, wrong calls are made and people die because of it. Somehow, Marines being Marines, manage to keep their brain housing groups swiveled on tight and their sense of humor at the ready. This series demonstrated how Marines will make do under the worst of situations, and it kept this old Vietnam Veteran glued to the tube. Too bad the series lasted only one season. I was up for more, and so were the Marines of Generation Kill.

Just as in real life, there are people in management you instantly dislike, and several of the officers in this program reminded me of some of the people who used to give me unrealistic, uneducated orders based on how it would make them look rather than how it would effect everyone else. It was obvious that those in command had no long term plan -- they just wanted to get in, conquer and move on while patting themselves on the back. meanwhile, many of those who had to carry out their orders realized what a mess they were making, and even though they wanted to help the people affected, couldn't.",1469318400,2,683,4.428571428571429

3458888,5,B001AQO3WY,"10 Stars. Wish they did a 2nd season. I'm an OIF 1 vet. They use all of the real jargon, which could be a turn off to those that don't know, but slowly throughout they explain all of the slang and acronyms. Not political, but does show the poor planning involved . Very much from a low ranking soldier's (Marine's) perspective. Compared to Band of Brothers which is more from an Officer's perspective. No offense to anyone, but the topics of conversation are a little different. Be prepared for some vulgarity, but you'll probably learn some new words.  My wife really enjoyed it too... not the fighting parts, but seeing the emotions and how they dealt with the boredom.

3459174,5,B001AQO3WY,"This is probably the most accurate depiction of being in a combat environment I have seen.  It's not all fun, it's not always exciting, it sometimes seems pointless and senseless, but the movie really illustrates the uniquely strong bonds of men that develop in combat.  This depiction of war is the best and most authentic that I have seen.  One thing is that the soldiers/marines/airmen are not really that good looking or as witty, but they are as vulgar, maybe more so.  Also, the movie didn't really show how unbelievably hot you get when its 115 degrees in the shade while you are in full battle rattle.",1464307200,,609,4.663551401869159

Surviving the environment as well as the war and how the Marines make do with what they have which is often much less than other forces. Strong leaders, quiet leaders, and the goofball leaders. I think a lot of that is presented pretty well. I haven't made it through all of the episodes yet, but some of the firefights depicted are exciting, but don't seem very realistic. Marines in open, unarmored Humvees being ambushed from all sides on a restricted road in a town by automatic fire and no casualties?",1461196800,,638,4.8090909090909095

3460009,2,B001AQO3WY,Maybe I was expecting more action but so far it is very slow to get moving. Brings you to the edge of your seat and then lulls you back to sleep as nothing happens. Only to episode 7 so I am hoping it will get better. If this is based on what really happened you can't help but get upset when you see how ill prepared our troops where when they were sent into battle. That is shame as we have the greatest military in the world and this makes it look like we were the most ill prepared. I hate that for our fighting men and women.,1461024000,2,530,3.9166666666666665

3460157,4,B001AQO3WY,"This show had plot movement but I felt it was inconsistent and not as tight as it could have been. Granted it is difficult to develop across so many characters so I would not discount watching this show based on my prior comment. I don't understand why the end of show focused on aggression between various marines as I suspect there were many other places the plot could have ended up but it certainly stayed in line with the series' title.

Overall I would recommend watching the series to help experience real aspects of modern warfare.

Thanks for reading.

3460367,5,B001AQO3WY,"Being Marine OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom) vet. myself, this is one of the best depictions of any military based movie/show I have ever seen. If this movie could be rated higher I would purely to the fact they got everything dead on! Actor's, director, visual effects and plot everything was amazing!!  The only thing that did bother me was they did go overboard on the incompetence of people like captain America and a few others, there is no way that in they could have made it that far in their career with any sort of behavior or mentality like that.",1456531200,,554,4.54

The characters are so engrossing that you feel like you personally know them by the final episode, and can really feel the impact every little thing that happens has on them, up until the very end. It shows just what war can do to a person mentally, which we all see in the final episode. If you haven't watched it I strongly encourage anyone who was a fan of band of brothers to watch this series, however short it may be. Get some!",1455580800,,538,4.233009708737864

3460540,1,B001AQO3WY,"I was expecting a hard charging USMC mini-series but what I got was a constant barrage of anti-war, anti-military episodes.  The enlisted Marines were portrayed as war mongers, the senior enlisted had their head up leadership's butt, the junior officers were all inept and senior leadership was completely out of touch with the situation on the ground.  I have been in the military for decades and likewise in the civilian world and the Marines I have come in contact with were nothing like the characters in Generation Kill. If you are ever in trouble in any of the crapholes in the world, you want the United States Marines coming to save your butt.  I am sure the poor folks in Benghazi would have appreciated a platoon of Marines that night in September.",1454976000,4,758,4.7272727272727275

3460596,5,B001AQO3WY,"Fantastic!  If you wrote a one star, then you don't really know anything.  I've lived and worked behind Marines my whole career. MARSOC, RECON, Infantry, etc. They are the rudest, crudest killing machines on the planet.  Though they all are sympathetic and human.  There isn't a better group of people I want getting my 6 than Marines.  My dad is retired Marine Infantry, and I'm proud to have walked the trenches next to some of the finest warriors on this planet.

I was in Iraq in 2004, on the ground, and I've been in Afghanistan since 2007 (Still here) working beside Marines, and other forces.  This series is a good depiction of the life and struggle of the Marine.  These guys are rough around the edges but would give their lives in a heart beat for their Marine brethren, or any person who isn't the enemy. There were a lot of mistakes made in these wars, hell we are still making them, but the idea is to learn from these and hope they don't happen again.  This series showed how these mistakes affected these Marines, and it shower their human side. This is real life combat people.

This show hit all the marks of humankind's nature of contradiction and balance-seeking.  It's war, and war at its sometimes ""hurry up and wait"" pace.  And this particular war in Iraq led many U.S. forces to seeing/performing not one day of battle.  It's worth a watch if you like slow-paced characterization and story-building.  It's all about the personalities that come together to enrich the story, characters unrushed, unapologetic and trusted by their fellows and us viewers.",1453507200,,608,5.163265306122449

3460989,5,B001AQO3WY,"As a Navy man who trained with the Marines in the Panama Canal Zone I say Generation Kill is the most honest portrayal of the military and war  than any other book or movie I know of. The BS that runs through Command reflecting petty egos and the sick minds of so many lifers who would have a hard time ever making it any where in civilian life without themselves being killed or imprisoned. War is not a good place for them but the only place for them as they see war or at least enemies every where they go. They need to be in charge even if the only way they get it is with a gun or a uniform.
I loved the heart of the comradeship, the glimmer of hope of those that question the sanity of it all, and the exposure of the military's twisted damaged foundation that the the worlds power hungry sickos thrive on.
Thank you all who did such a great job researching, writing, acting, filming, and all the rest of it. I give it five stars and five moons... It's better than good.",1453248000,,976,4.136842105263158

I've been selling my DVD boxsets in favor of buying Blu-Ray boxsets and this one is no exception. High quality show from the guy who brought you The Wire. As someone who's deployed to Iraq, I often tell people this show is like someone recording my deployment in terms of dialogue, etiquette, etc. My ONLY issue with the dialogue is that a Sergeant and a Lieutenant use first names and that simply doesn't happen in real life USMC. Your first name is your rank. Your last name is your last name. There's no ""Brad"" or whatever that is in the USMC. Other than that, a very true-to-life depiction of deployment in Iraq.

3461028,2,B001AQO3WY,"Just finished watching this series. In my opinion it has some aspects that are very realistic and accurate, and other aspects that come across as political propaganda and disdain for the U.S. Marine Corps.

The Good:
The dialogue and military vernacular seem to be authentic. References to military equipment and procedures seem to be very accurate. Not that phony Hollywood military speak that you hear in many films and TV shows that involve the military. Clearly the producers hired a very good military adviser to write the dialog. Most of the equipment used (with some exceptions) looked to be accurate. The story line is also interesting and holds your attention. There are some good battle scenes. Nothing over the top. But it does give you a feel for what its like to be in combat. Confusion, conflicting orders, not always knowing where to shoot, and worrying about killing non-combatants.

The Bad:
This series portrays U.S. Marine senior officers and NCOs as clueless, incompetent and out of touch. Some are portrayed as gung-ho idiots. The rank and file enlisted men are shown in a much more positive light, but are often portrayed as foul mouth degenerates. While many believe this to be the ""real"" Marine Corps, it is not. That is not to say that people like this do not exist in the Marine Corps, or in any other branch of the U.S. military for that matter. They do. But not on the scale that is portrayed here. After watching this series, one gets the impression that the entire Marine Corps is incompetent and dysfunctional. Which if were true, the Marines would have never succeeded in Iraq or Afghanistan. In addition, the writers occasionally inject liberal political views about the war into the story. This would not be a problem if opposing views were given to show that there were intelligent and competent Marines that held differing opinions about the war. However, opposing views were rarely given, and when they were, it was presented by characters that were portrayed as idiots.

Neither Good Nor Bad:
There are few scenes depicting mutilated bodies. This is common with recent films and series that attempt to accurately portray the horror of ground combat. Some of these scenes border on being gratuitous, but it is the reality of war and fits. However, it is not something for children or the squeamish.

Conclusion:
This is a mildly entertaining series for military enthusiasts. It looks and sounds very realistic on the surface, but left me with me with such a bad taste in my mouth that I felt compelled to write this review. I got the impression that this story was written by a disgruntled former enlisted Marine. Someone lacking in morals, who disliked his superiors and disagreed with every order he was given. While I found the military dialogue and equipment to be very realistic, I found the portrayal of senior Marine officers and NCOs to be an insult to the fine men and women that have and are now serving as officers and NCOs in the Marine Corps.",1452816000,4,2992,4.826510721247564

Based on a great book of journalism, Generation Kill is an (almost) uncompromising look at the wars America fights and the warrior culture it raised to fight them. Many of the people who previously worked on The Wire contributed to Generation Kill as well and it shows. The show is beautifully shot, masterfully directed, and tremendously well-acted, but the best part is, as on The Wire, David Simon's and Ed Burns' writing. Sharp, honest, and darkly funny, the writers play no favorites and pulls no punches. A great show.",1449100800,,590,4.737864077669903
3461079,2,B001AQO3WY,"basically, think ""MASH""..... but in Iraq, and infantry, instead of medical. And like MASH, there is a pervasive cynicism that is bad enough that it actually annoyed me. Marines tend to talk a lot of smack, and complain, but this was more like a diatribe of misery.

The GOOD: The characters are great. For example, the SgtMaj was freaking hilarious! Everyone in the service knows someone like this...who is so tight and squared away that he becomes a character. by the end of the first 2 episodes, you pretty much like the group.  The pacing is good, and the banter is also really funny. It also shows some of the real politics in command structures. You really feel for the LT by the end of the series...

The BAD: well....let's just say that every episode revolves around groups of ""war crimes"" and abject incompetence by marines. That's total BS. Every scene has a marine smoking some innocent kid, or calling in an airstrike on a church. Yeh....like that is accurate...lol.  The other thing was the constant bitching by the characters. Marines are known to bitch, but they don't go around constantly doubting their country and it's mission. If it was all this bad, Marines would be working a different job. But that is what soured it for me. Most marines are pros, and they do a worthwhile mission. In the end they gave them the M*A*S*H treatment and sh! t-canned the series. You rarely see any camaraderie in ANY of the scenes. It's not the military I know...

Overall, it's not really going to make people in the service fans of the series. They should learn a little from American Sniper and show some of the brave things we do.....",1449100800,,1639,4.637931034482759

About halfway through Fick's book, he begins to train to become a recon Marine, gets attached to 1st Recon and deploys with them to Iraq.  He mentions meeting Evan Wright, the writer of Generation Kill, and that's what sparked my interest to really watch the show.  Overall, it was a great experience.

3461582,4,B001AQO3WY,"This series was suggested to me by another fellow Marine. It was interesting to say the least. I was in the 1st Marine Division, and found a lot of the acting and events to be pretty well portrayed, but would not recommend this show to everyone. Much of the story is pretty much Marines being Marines, and the action is not for children or the faint of heart! This is about Infantry Recon Marines, and we don't get stuff done by being politically correct, or sensitive to everyone's feelings! I found the egotism, idiocy, and pure indecisiveness of the portrayed leadership in the unit to be pretty spot on with how things can be sometimes. All the way down to the lunatic Sgt. Major (had one myself), and the foolish boot officers, this show proved that Marine NCO's are still the front line leaders that are the glue that keeps our infantry effective! If you're a Marine or former Marine, this show is worth a watch! If you're a spouse or parent of a Marine currently serving, I would caution you that you might see a disturbing side to US that most people are not always prepared for! We are warriors, and it's not always pretty!",1444262400,,1132,4.5

3461612,5,B001AQO3WY,"Great series! Mostly since I served with the 1st Battalion 5th Marines in 2003 and was one of the first vehicles into Bahgdad during the invasion. Of course it's not 100% accurate but it's close and definitely has entertainment value with all of the innuendos that we can only understand. I'm assuming the reporter is portraying one of the lead journalists throughout the engagement. If that was AP reporter Ross Simpson, then this is lossely based on my weapons company. That and they all ride around in humvees the same as we did for that deployment as the weapons company.

The ""Godfather"" is nothing resembling ""Geronimo"" in any respect, which I assume was to increase the dramatics with the show. Would have been cool though. The SgtMaj is a smaller more annoying version of SgtMaj Kenneth Jones. But he did make us undergo Operation Camp Beautification when we stayed as Saddam's palace within hours after all the shooting had stopped.
The best part of the show from my perspective is the reporter and his reactions to how the Marines shift back and forth between combat and casual.",1444176000,2,1088,4.818181818181818

That Staff Sargent reminds me of myself when I was on duty. But that is the exception of the rule. I want to call to the people of good heart to raise their voices against this bad propaganda that hurts the image of a nation and its true reasons to engage in these foreign conflicts. Or is that we have come so down to become the ""other side"" where our enemy is ""the good people"" and we are the ""evil empire"".

3461697,5,B001AQO3WY,"Generation Kill is one of the best miniseries of any genre that I've seen. It was so good, I watched its entirety twice. The writing is crisp, and the only overacting comes from a character who's prone to histrionics, anyway (""Captain America""). The ensemble cast, which included some actual military vets, was outstanding. I especially liked the characters of ""Iceman"", Ray, Lt. Fick, Sgt. Rudy Reyes (playing himself), and the world-weary ""Doc"". What also really works in this series is the absence of background music, which gives the narrative a matter-of-fact, deadpan tone, and an immediacy that drew me in.

3461702,4,B001AQO3WY,"Purports to show a Marine unit during the early 2000s in Iraq.  Based upon a book written by a reporter for the liberal leaning magazine Rolling Stones.  That magazine doesn't have a reputation for journalistic integrity.  However, the reviews of the book that this HBO series is based upon are largely positive.  The reporter was embedded with this Marine unit.  The Marines apparently are unable to complete a simple sentence without cursing...a lot.  As a veteran I can relate to that, but I was left wondering if the series was meant to show the truth or portray these Marines as profane, homophobic, sexist killers.  I guess you can take it for whatever you want to believe based on your political leanings.  My position is that war is hell as Sherman said & nasty.  You take kids, teach them to kill & then act surprised when they swear & shoot bad guys.  Well, somebody's got to do it.  Worth watching.",1443139200,,909,4.654088050314465

3462620,5,B001AQO3WY,"The lines from the TV series are taken right from the book which is very well-written. Great insight into the realistic travails of typical young adults at war and the absurdities that ensue. Certain lines uttered by the marines are truly ironic. They are told to disregard the rules of engagement in a particular instance. It is apparently sanctioned to kill an Iraqi but not a stray animal wandering the Iraqi desert. Similarly, these marines execute dangerous missions yet are then chided by a superior for not maintaining ""proper grooming standards."" Despite the seriousness of war, there is uncensored humor in the way these young males talk about their incompetent commanders, sexuality, their personal hygiene, and other subjects that would be taboo in polite society. The embedded journalist and author of the book, humanizes these ""kids"" and uncovers insights into their diverse ethnic backgrounds and personalities. For those of you sensitive to offensive language, the ""f"" word in its various grammatical forms, is shared liberally about 60 - 70 times per episode. (yes, i counted.)

I certainly didn't experience those types of Officers all at one time but over my 26 years in the AF I had the pleasure (not) of serving under some really extreme people as shown in this series.

I don't want to give anything away, but this is one I'd highly recommend. It's definitely NOT for the squeamish, or for those of  an impressionable age/mindset, but for adults who might think they'd have ANY interest, watch one or two to give it a try!",1436745600,,655,4.413223140495868

3463029,5,B001AQO3WY,"SO MUCH ACCURATE DETAIL

This series paints a pretty accurate representation of the Marine Corps as it's seen through the eyes of younger enlisted men. The Lance Corporals, Corporals, and Sergeants do all the real work and do it fantastically. The higher up the chain of command you get, the goofier every decision seems....to the E-3's, E-4's and E-5's. The perspective of the command officers and senior NCO's isn't looked at closely, but snippets of their motivations behind their decisions show that all the seemingly idiotic decisions they make might actually have a purpose. (For example the Sergeant Major distracting the Marines from real problems by giving them meaningless alternate problems to worry about. It's annoying to have someone argue with you about facial hair. But being angry about that keeps you from worrying about if you're going to get shot at that night)

That's what life is like in the Marine Corps as an E-4. Nothing makes sense based on your perspective and what you can see going on. Decisions made by officers located elsewhere often seem idiotic. But you rarely see the full picture to see how those command decisions make sense when applied to a larger scenario. That's frustrating to a young enlisted Marine. But, as the Marine Corps will tell you, suck it up and deal with it. You aren't there to understanding, just to do.

There are some characters who actually are idiots. Captain America is a legitimate buffoon. There are officers like that...but not to that degree. He is somewhat of a caricature. But the rest of the case felt pretty accurately portrayed.

There is so much detail that makes this authentic I can't list it all here. But it's the little things, like the Marines saying 'Semper Gumby. Always flexible!' when their orders change for the 5th time in an hour. That's a very real highly utilized saying from my day in the Corps. I also never met a Marine who would eat Charms from an MRE pack. They are disgusting cheap candy that even a hungry Marine doesn't want. The show mentions that repeatedly. That kind of detail gives the show such an authentic look and feel. Pair that with the authenticity of how Marines make due to old equipment and somehow manage to do more with it, and you get a really accurate picture of US Marines in this show.

The filming and sound effects of the LAV platoons wad dead on point accurate. I can personally attest to the fact that LAV-25 move and fire their weapons exactly as depicted here. The sound of the main gun was perfectly captured. And it's always shown firing in 3 round bursts (which is the only way a gunner ever shoots that main gun)

The one thing I didn't think resonated true was the portrayal of reservists. Reservists are not morons who don't belong in a fight. Some are...but then some active duty Marines are too. There are some really solid reserve units out there. There are some worthless active duty unit out there.

I see other negative reviews of this show from other Marines who call this show offensive to Marines, seemingly because it doesn't show them as totally buttoned up and put together at all times. But that's just not what real life is like. I found the Marines depicted here to accurately reflect the Marines I served with for 6 years. Every scene was believable to me.

All in all this 7 episode series is WELL worth watching.",1435449600,2,3358,4.698979591836735

3463126,5,B001AQO3WY,"If you are a  veteran- you need to see this.  If you like military and war stories- you need to see this.  If you love REAL historical TRUE stories and details - you need to see this.  Lastly, if you are a Marine and you haven't seen this- you're wrong.

This is about the Recon Platoon from Camp Pendleton that lead the initial push into Iraq.

Let me tell you this- the actors look just like the real Marines, and act JUST like them.  BUT....""Fruity Rudy""... they couldn't find an actor to play him- he's that quirky and amazing and beautiful and Fruity... so in this series, Fruity Rudy is the actual Recon Marine from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, not an actor.  He made sure it was accurate, too.

I watch this series at least once a year and I love it.  I also buy this for anyone with kids going INTO the Marine Corps.  Very motivating, very true, very real, and very funny.

3463253,5,B001AQO3WY,"At first glance the title said said to me: ""Another documentary about the war in Iraq.""  After some quick background research, I gave the first episode a try and was pleased to find out its nothing like that.

My (civilian perspective) review:

Presentation-wise it, it felt like ""Jarhead"" meets ""Band of Brothers,"" with a lot of discussion about the politics and disconnects up and down the military chain of command.  Pretty much everything in the series happens ""out in the field,"" with a heavy theme: ""decisions matter, and confusion carries a cost."" I mean this in a very respectful: ""Coordinating hundreds/thousands of people is generally very difficult"" kind of way.

Having recently watched ""Band of Brothers,"" I found it interesting just how different the combat is between the two.  Access to radio communications, mechanized movement, (unreliable) night vision (including thermal) and standardized automatic weapons, definitely impacts the thinking on both sides of the conflict.

There's also many strong scenes hinting at problems to come (e.g. extremists), especially in the middle, up to the end of the series.",1432857600,,1125,5.322033898305085

Another: Yeah if we were in California we would be executed.

The dialogue from the book is excellent and transfers well to the screen.

In Bagdad they see all the local women working, while all the local men congregate. A marine states: if we had to fight haji women instead of the men we would have gotten our ammes kicked.

3463336,4,B001AQO3WY,"Poignant, distressing, tragic, bleak.  This series splays open the dangerous and vindictive incompetence of the operation to take down Iraq and Saddam.  Most people with any intelligence know that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld were FOS about weapons of mass destruction on their little ""crusade"" (Bush's word), but to see the ineptness of the military who was actually on the ground portrayed here was sickening.  You had officers promoted to the level of incompetence giving dangerous and absurd orders and those who stood up to it were severely disciplined and ridiculed.  The average soldier was forced to slog through this ocean of ineptness.  Mild spoiler: there is very little actual battle here, in episode five there is some, but they are portrayed as amateur fighters (some from other countries).  The higher ups (aka the ""Godfather"") was only interested in gaining the attention of his superiors for awards/recognistion.  Once the war is ""over"" you once again see the average soldier wanting to help the civilians, but being constantly overruled by the inadequacy of those up the food chain.  The last episode demonstrates how utterly unprepared for ""victory"" the US was, letting rioting and pillaging happen in hopes that the two sides would just kill each other.  Wow.  I have no idea how accurate this is, but judging from the other comments it appears it is fairly accurate, this is depressing.  As one sergeant states in the last episode when another incompetent order comes through damaging the civilian population (paraphrasing) ""don't they know the whole world already hates us?""  I wonder why.",1431561600,,1608,5.166023166023166

3463427,3,B001AQO3WY,"Dad was (is) a Marine served in the Gulf War and again in Iraq. He doesn't talk about his experiences, but once when I was younger while he was watching Enemy at the Gates I heard him talk about being on a 50cal atop a Humvee. I wanted to be part of the big boy conversation with his friends and I remember asking if he killed anyone and he yelled at me and sent me to my room. That was the full extent of my knowledge about my fathers service.

I'm 24 and after watching the series I asked my father in a more eloquent way if scenes in the show were similar to his experiences?
He said yes and no. S%#ty situation yes, but the constant morality struggles because we keep killing civilians no. In the Marines that just doesn't happen and if it does there is no G-father bombing civilians right in front of your eyes a mile down the road. There's S#@t birds in the Marine Corps and dumba%$ officer's but not like in this show.

Lots of comments say this show doesn't condemn or glorify war, its just telling a realistic story of the soldiers mentality.  Maybe, but when I talked about the scenes like in episode 6 33:00 where the soldier comments that if they were home they would go to prison for what they have done here, I was met with head shakes, sighs and eye rolls from my father.

I guess my point is Hollywood, most media and HBO is predominately Liberal now a days(we have all seen Game of Thrones and its celebration of....um story?) and part of the Liberal thought system involves condemning war in subtle ways and using even fiction as a medium to influence your opinion on real subjects. Talk to the people who were in those combat M.O.S's and do some research to formulate your own opinion.

3463522,4,B001AQO3WY,"Generation Kill Season 1 Series does a great job of Marine personal living under close conditions in the War with Iraq. The various Marines are both colorful in the raw language and raw feelings of being in the Military. The series journey is time well spent as you see the politics of the various main Characters interact (Officers and enlisted, various races) and react to the world around them. Unlike shows before them you get to see the horrors of war and it's effects on the civilians and results, there is no holding back as you can get into the heads of the various Marines having to experience it. The show was filmed in Africa, but has the real feel of having been filmed on location in Iraq. Of all of the  war shows series that have been made this is probably the closest to todays reality yet. Got to go now want to see last episode of Season 1, TV worth watching.

  Finished watching, loved the last few minutes of the ending with a Marine that had been filming during the entires series of the experience on a Sony Hand camera of the Marines experiences. Shows the group of those Marines the many changes of personal values as they view the positive and negative results of their actions. Reminding us that the filter of the experience it is from a personal experience. Not many of the Marines stay to few the whole video as the unfolds with the horror of dead road side bodies, video of exploding bodies from shells, the lawlessness of the Government, destruction of towns in the path.

3463524,5,B001AQO3WY,"I loved this series, principally because the patient directing style allowed for subtle acting by the actors, who were able to communicate strong emotions despite being highly disciplined professional soldiers.  What was most salient was the contempt of the lower ranks and lower commissioned officers for their superior officers, who are portrayed either as impulsive morons or egomaniacs merely looking to score points with the general at the risk of the men themselves.  The few clearly excellent and intelligent soldiers allow their impatience to drip from their tightly-held composure. A beautifully done series.

3463565,5,B001AQO3WY,"About as true to the experience as television gets, HBO did their homework and had some decent advising when it came to how botched some of the logistics were in March of 2003. Really shows the way situations look to the top brass, the reasoning behind their decisions, and are then handed down to those that actually have the task of doing the work. Lots of moments in the show did a good job of recreating the 'pucker factor' of sitting in a HMMWV that's parked in the middle of a deserted Iraqi intersection because some butter bar in the rear thought it was a good idea to halt the entire battalion because one company had contact. Like the corp, some of the best moments of the show come when there is absolutely nothing going on, and you begin to see the strengths and flaws that exist in a group, and how the grooming standard exists to eliminate said flaws. Reall, it makes you wonder what 'The Pacific' would have been like had it come out 5 years or so after VJ day.",1428451200,,976,4.33879781420765

3463567,4,B001AQO3WY,"I thought Generation Kill was entertaining and informative.  It's not quite to the level of Band of Brothers, but it is still pretty good.  It has led me to consider more closely why we chose to go to war in Iraq.  I now think it was more of a personal vendetta than anything else . . . and, boy, what a mess it has left.  There are a couple of things don't ring true.  First, you don't question officers' orders or motives.  You may not like them, but you don't question them.  Anyone who has ever served knows that.  Secondly, if those at the point of such an invasion lose so few, the other side ain't much.  The level of violence is pretty sickening.

3463589,1,B001AQO3WY,"As a former Marine from this era I was pretty disgusted with the program. I watched the entire program so I could comment on it's entire content.

From an entertainment perspective it lacked depth and character development. I liked the cinematography, the production design and the props used to make the project authentic. Even some of the dialogue regarding Marine Corps life was accurate.

I didn't have an issue with the tongue and cheek dialogue between characters although it was over the top much like ""Jarhead"" was. We did curse and carry on but not like it's depicted in movies the last 5 to 8 years.

This show made Marine Force Reconesence look like a bunch of  undisciplined,  uneducated, leaderless fools. Lacking bearing, compassion or honor except for two or three characters who had those qualities. When it should of been the reverse with the majority having Nobel qualities and a few shorebirds.

I was an NCO and for the most part our staff NCO's and Officers where nothing like the ones characterized in ""Generation Kill"". I cant speak for all of them but the Marine corp has a great reputation for developing combat leaders. The exact opposite of the leadership characterized in this weak hollywood depiction of an elite military unit.",1428192000,13,1256,4.900943396226415

This series was a realistic representation about how our leadership failed American troops on the ground with the invasion.

The movie explifies following orders, and how if you refuse an order, you can be slapped with an Article 15, which is essentially nonjudicial punishment. This movie portrays the brown nosers for who they are, and are out for their own selfish interests. The actors that were Ray and Nate were casted perfectly for their roles, and were very likable.

Great HBO interview with the Evan Wright, and the real recon marines.

And, I wonder if the  ego-guided, bumbling, stumbling arrogance of the officers and ""the Godfather"" is exaggerated beyond reality, just to make an interesting story.
