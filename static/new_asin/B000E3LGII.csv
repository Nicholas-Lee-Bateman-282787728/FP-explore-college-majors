8105434,5,B000E3LGII,"The battle for spots on the Executive Council go on as Maya continues to drift further away from her brother Shin and closer to Mitsuomi. Of course, this doesn't sit well with an already mentally unstable Shin whose mind is being further eaten away by the cursed sword of his family, a sword by the way, that he used to kill his own parents! When Fu Chen attempts to sexually assault Maya, Shin's love and madness is on full display as he begins to wipe out both enemies and friends! Will even Mitsuomi and Bunshichi's powers be enough to stop him?

It's a shame that this series is just now getting good and it's going to end in one volume. I think that Tenjho Tenge should have been split into two shows, with these flashbacks to Shin, Maya, and Mitsuomi's story being shown in the correct chronological order. If that would have been done, then you could see the strength of the story in the past and the weakness of most of the action taking place in the present. The characters in the past are more interesting too, especially Shin and the weird relationship that might border on incestuous love. Or is just that his mind is so messed up, he can't let go of the only person he's close to? I think you can wrap up the old storyline in one volume, but I'm sure the present will be left unresolved in Volume 8, begging for a second season.",1159747200,2,1341,4.364
