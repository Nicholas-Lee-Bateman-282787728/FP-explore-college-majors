8262996,4,B0016KTG1M,"""Margin for Error"" from 1943 marked Otto Preminger's successful re-entry into Hollywood after having a battle with mogul Selznick who sought to banish the fledgling director.  Otto had gone back to Broadway and directed the play written by Clare Booth Luce and because an actor could not go on, Otto stepped in in a rather triumphant role he would become somewhat type-cast as a Nazi official. (He also happily appeared in TV's ""Batman"" series as ""Mr. Freeze"").  When the movie version was to be made, they wanted Preminger to repeat his role as an actor, but he held out and agreed if he could direct again.  This brought him into the disdain of Selznick again and Preminger, with contract in hand to produce, direct and/or act, he the next year directed his break-out film classic, ""Laura"" despite the cold shoulder Selznick gave.  In ""Margin for Error"" the acting ends up second to the writing by Lillie Hayward and Otto's economic direction.  That was probably Otto's real brilliance, bringing his pictures in usually under budget and his direction has a resulting simplicity.  Directing Sal Mineo's Oscar-nominated performance in ""Exodus"" years later saw one of Sal's most gripping scenes filmed from the back which resulted from Otto's stubbornness with camera placement and fluidity of his working with actors while in the frame.  And to Sal's enormous credit, the scene came alive through the muscles of his back and arms as his whole body displayed his torment at he re-lived the ordeal of his treatment in a concentration camp.  In ""Margin for Error"" the film in a somewhat unreal story of an evil Nazi consul (played by Preminger) operating with police cooperation in perhaps a city like New York comes together largely a comedy.  Joan Bennett plays his blackmailed wife and Milton Berle (giving perhaps a more hammy performance than any of the others in the cast) is a Jewish police officer asked to protect the consul.  In Otto's skillful hands, the movie is never boring and plays out its contrived plot efficiently and satisfyingly.  It really could not qualify as an accurate portrayal of the Third Reich in dramatic fashion, but is more dastardly than funny and becomes a curiosity in its place in history, both in life and on film. 20th Century-Fox released this DVD for the Portuguese and Spanish market but it is Region 1 and full screen with a good transfer and in English. Fox/Oregon also brought us Otto's ""A Royal Scandal"" (GB title: ""Czarina"") similarly.",1341792000,10,2479,4.920863309352518

The policeman in charge of the ambassador's protection will have to solve a murder at the embassy the night of a radio broadcasted speech of the F&uuml;hrer. The film presents an interesting mix of comic scenes, brought by Milton Berle, and war thriller scenes with well documented details. A curiosity.
