2345705,5,B000A0GOP0,"Despite keeping agonized fans waiting due to the '80-'81 season actors' strike, ""Taxi"" more than made up for the wait by gradually entering the greatest half of its history.  It had gone out of the slump weighing it down during the previous season, mainly with New Blood among the writers: rookies Ken Estin & the team of Ian Praiser/Howard Gewirtz (who'd all be promoted to producer for the even-better fourth season); veteran David Lloyd (who copped the writing Emmy 5 years before with his ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"" episode of Mary Tyler Moore); future ""Married With Children"" producer Katherine Green; and future ""Simpsons"" creator Sam Simon.

It was THEIR variety that provided the spice for the latter part of this season.......and the magnificent fourth & fifth seasons, when the series was able to be all it could be.  The inspiration, too, must've rubbed off on The Old Guard: writers/producers Glen & Les Charles, and Barry Kemp & Earl Pomerantz.

Among the ALL-TIME CHAMPS among the classics this season are the Charles brothers' ""Zen & The Art Of Cab-Driving,"" in which a couple of Reverend Jim's fares discuss positive thinking enabling one to reach any goal, so Jim decides to become Sunshine's prizewinning cabbie, raking in the loot......all so he can get ""ultimate TV,"" which he proudly displays to his colleagues.

Another GREAT great episode is the series' all-time howler, ""Louie Bumps Into An Old Lady.""  Penned by David Lloyd, it's lethally funny: while driving a pretty new cabbie around, Louie hits an elderly gal, who sues him for a cool million.  Alex informs Louie that the lady in question is an notorious scam artist, making Louie scheme his revenge......the only twist (to what otherwise would've been a ""cliche-comedy"" plot) is that the poor gal REALLY WASN'T FOOLING!  A scream.

Also, there's Katherine Green's debut script, ""Call Of The Mild,"" taking its cue from Estin's breakthrough ""Alex Jumps Out Of An Airplane"" episode of the previous season: it takes place almost ENTIRELY outside the garage.  Tony, Bobby, Alex & Jim decide to rough it at an isolated mountain cabin--getting more (less?) than they bargained on: being snowbound & without food during a horrendous blizzard (someone stole all their food which they stupidly left outdoors for lack of a fridge)......they're finally forced to make do with a wandering turkey whom Jim calls ""Ernie"" (""He LOOKS like an Ernie!""); a reluctant Alex is the designated assassin.  The series' unsurpassed expertise at combining comedy with pathos is seen to best advantage during Jim's somber (but still unintentionally humorous) table-prayer.

In ""Elaine's Strange Triangle,"" Tony finds out that the handsome gent whom he thought had winked at Elaine, is really interested in HIM. When Alex is asked to intervene at the young man's favorite hang-out, the hilarity REALLY begins! (This episode copped Emmys for directing & editing; writer Lloyd got nominated but didn't win.)

Ranking just below these all-time greats are those episodes which, in many ways, were what actually made the series so special: episodes with creative story-slants of some sort that were quite engaging, and more than justifying the purchase of any of the ""Taxi"" complete-season sets. Here, we have ""Fathers Of The Bride"" where Alex becomes furious when he finds his ex-wife (Louise Lasser) didn't invite him to their daughter's wedding; ""Latka's Cookies,"" written by the Charles brothers, in which Latka dreams of being cookie-king with his grandmother's strange recipe (watch for the cameo from Wally ""Famous"" Amos himself); and the two-parter ""On The Job"" (written by Praiser & Gewirtz) in which the cabbies pound the pavement for other jobs when the cab company goes under.",1121904000,21,3733,5.160596026490066
2345706,5,B000A0GOP0,The cabbies finding hilarious jobs when the Sunshine Cab Company goes broke. Louie (literally) leaping into bed after defeating his scruples. Alex going uninvited to his daughter's wedding and fighting/making-up with his ex-wife. The first appearance by Louie's mother (Danny de Vito's real life mom). This season has some of my favorite moments of one of the all-time greatest shows. Highly recommended.,1121644800,3,404,5.532258064516129
2345707,5,B000A0GOP0,"The 1980-81 season,Taxi's third,began unusually late due to an actors' strike(it began around July and ended in September). Joining the Taxi cast this season is Carol Kane as Simka Gratvas who would become Latka's(the late Andy Kaufman) wife at the end of this season. All the original cast is still here but after this season,Jeff Conaway as Bobby Wheeler would leave the series. ABC had a handful of hit sitcoms,those being Three's Company,Happy Days,Laverne & Shirley and Mork & Mindy. The 1980-81 season saw the premiere of Bosom Buddies and Too Close For Comfort.",1121212800,3,568,5.053191489361702
2345708,5,B000A0GOP0,"I think there are four great sitcoms: The Mary Tyler Mooore Show, Taxi, Cheers, and Seinfeld (note, many of the same writers actually worked on the first three). Seasons of a show vary a lot. Most get worse over time: Seinfeld was embarassing after Larry David left; Cheers was at its best in the first five years; Taxi really wasn't very good in its first or last years. Oddly, MTM was excellent even in its seventh (perhaps one reason why it often ranks as the greatest sitcom of all time).

Taxi was not a consistently brilliant show. It was generally good, often very good, and on occasion superb. I can't think of another sitcom episode as brilliant as either ""Latka the Playboy"" or ""Mr Personalities."" For both daring and execution, they are the most intelligent - and I think funniest - episodes of TV comedy I've seen. (Seinfeld's ""The Contest"" is easily as funny, but conceptually it's not as original as the two Taxi eps.)

As I've said, the first season of Taxi was nothing special. Randall Carver wasn't very good. And Jim hadn't yet arrived. Season 2 showed how good the show could be: ""Reverand Jim, A Space Odyssey"" was one of the show's best episodes (it was Jim's first as a regular). ""Elaine's Secret Admirer"" was touching and poignant in a way few situation comedies are. But many of the other episodes were so-so.

With Season 3 the show achieved its true height. ""Tony's Sister and Jim"" is quirky and delicate, and it humanizes the nornally caricatured Jim (Tony's Sister is played by Julie Kavner, who would later ""play"" Marge Simpson). ""The Call of the Mild"" sees most of the gang roughing it in a cabin in the mountains. It's an unforgettable episode (partly because of a turkey called ""Ernie""). ""Latka's Cookies"" is on most people's list of favourite episodes. ""Zen and the Art of Cab Driving"" is a clever episode which celebrates television itself. The season ends with the great episode ""Latka the Playboy.""

If you buy only one season of Taxi, it has to be this one. It was the kind of literate show that you just don't see today (the only one that comes close in intelligence is Curb Your Enthusiasm, but that's a different kind of show, exploring the nature of comedy, and involving improv, etc.). It's worth pointing out that many of the best episodes of the show were written by Glen and Les Charles, and keep an eye out for their eps in earlier and later seasons. (Some of their best work was done for Cheers - the pilot being a prime example). Celebrate the art of TV and get this DVD.",1120435200,71,2519,4.591111111111111

2345803,4,B000A0GOP0,"Although I still found season 3 fun to watch, I personally didn't enjoy it as much as the first two seasons(some of the stories weren't as focused and can sometimes be too silly). I've yet to watch season 4 or 5 so I can't compare to those.

The Jim Ignatowski character became more of a focus during season 3. I personally enjoy it when the story revolves around ""Reverend"" Jim(there is some complexity to his character that is interesting to watch) as opposed to Latka.

Latka's character seems more single-layered(making funny faces and speaking unintelligible words) and can wear thin quickly. Many of the scenes with Latka during season 3 have him in a brief monologue type situation(as opposed to the previous two seasons where he is actually interacting with the other characters).

These are just my own observations. Someone else of course can view it differently. Regardless I still enjoyed season 3 and recommend it for fans of Taxi. It would've been really nice though if there could have been commentary from some of the cast members or some retrospective featurette.",1366588800,2,1080,4.923076923076923

2345837,5,B000A0GOP0,"I am glad that the Fourth Season finally became available.  In fact it found its way to the store video shelves almost the same time Season Five arrived.  Naturally I bought them both.

Some great episodes in this package, though the season was not without significant changes from Season Three.  First is that the character of actor Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conaway) is no longer a regular cast member.  Conaway left the show at the conclusion of Season Three and returned to the 1981 - 1982 season a couple times as a guest star.  Throughout this season we also have to deal with Latka's (Andy Kaufman) annoying alter egos.  As you may recall, Latka's multiple personality farce began in Season Three because Andy Kaufman grew tired of playing ""Foreign Man"" and threatened to leave the series.  Fortunately Carol Kane joined the series full time as Latka's wife Simka and largely put an end to the superfluous personality episodes.

In all there is only one episode in this set that pushes things a bit too far, and that is an episode where Louie is caught spying on Elaine in the women's locker room.  As a result of Elaine's complaint Louie is fired, rightly so, and the remainder of the episode is focused on Louie comically begging Elaine for his job.  I thought that Louie's reinstatement (which is never actually shown in the episode) was a little too generous based on the sensitive nature of his transgression.

Oh well, that's television.

Shows like ""Taxi"", ""M*A*S*H"", and ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" were when television was at it's funniest, while it still remained innocent enough for the whole family to sit down and watch together.  Today's television is way too adult oriented and offensive for the whole family to enjoy together.  These shows represented television during it's finest hour.  So, now, if only I could get the last two seasons of ""Taxi"".  However, forget ""WKRP in Cincinnati"". They changed all the original music on the the first season DVD release, plus the picture quality really sucks.

UPDATE:
Hey!  Guess What?  Volumes four and five of ""Taxi"" will be released in 2009 from CBS.

I felt stuck.  I'm a completist so I really hate being stuck with an incomplete concept like, for instance, the entire 5 seasons of ""Taxi"".

I was beginning to become afraid to start buying any TV shows on DVD for fear that they may decide not to finish what they started.

Well, thank God we will finally get to own all five seasons of ""Taxi"". I was wondering what CBS was waiting for.",1160870400,20,1258,4.877358490566038
2345864,4,B000A0GOP0,"Taxi, in my opinion, is one of the best sitcoms of all time. It started off slowly (season 1) but once the characters became better defined and new characters such as Jim Ignatowski and Simka Gravas were introduced, it really took off. Seasons 2 through 4 were definitely the best. The characters were so hilarious and memorable. Who can ever forget Louie Depalma's conniving ways or Latka's playboy alter ego (Vic Ferrari)? This series is a must have for classic sitcom lovers. Which brings me to my next point, when the heck is Season 4 coming out? This is arguably the best season of the series and it's been a lifetime since Season 3 has come out. I'm afraid the studios aren't going to release any more of this series which would be a shame considering there are only 2 more seasons to complete all the episodes. There is nothing on the Internet indicating a possible future release. Does anyone have any information on a possible Season 4 release?",1148860800,2,953,4.644970414201183

episodes in this set are [Zen and art of cabdriving],[Loui's

Rival] and [Latka the playboy] and my favorite scene is when

Latka transforms into Vic Ferrari after reading a playboy magazine. Taxi the complete third season is a must have collection

2345885,4,B000A0GOP0,I do have one major complaint about the first disc on this season it has 5 minutes of promos for other tv show dvd's which you cannot fast foward through and have to go through each time you put the first disc in and play it.,1131235200,9,225,3.9130434782608696

2345889,5,B000A0GOP0,"As a kid, I would stay up late to watch reruns of ""Taxi,"" all the while having to stifle my laughter so I wouldn't wake anyone up.  It seems obvious, but a good barometer of a comedy is how much you laugh, and ""Taxi"" does that better than just about any series in history.  I found myself watching this box set and laughing hysterically (in the middle of the day thankfully) at things I had seen many times before.  If people are wondering why the sitcom has seemingly hit rock bottom, just take a look at the exquisite writing on this show for some pointers!",1127779200,2,559,4.304761904761905
2345890,4,B000A0GOP0,"I agree that there are many classic episodes in this season, some that make you just laugh at loud.  My favorites are ""Elaine's Strange Triangle"", ""Tony's Sister and Jim"", and ""Thy Boss's Wife.""  I know that these DVD's sets are bare-bones, but a couple of the episodes either had a bad transfer or were just fading in the first place.  This show was so great that it deserves better.  I think Paramount knows they could release the show on Betamax and people like me will line up to get it.",1127692800,,491,4.4222222222222225
2345891,5,B000A0GOP0,"Some reviewers have called season three the best in the Taxi series but I disagree.  Of the first three seasons this one is far and away the best because the characters finally jelled, and were well-defined.  The writing is superb too and I don't think there is a bad episode in the lot. That said, I have raves for the subsequent seasons, too, and hope that they are released quickly.  This is where Taxi hit a peak and stayed there for a while.  There's a good mix of different sorts of humor - the outrageous kind in the episode about Latka becoming Vic Ferrari, to more low-key, warming humor as when we meet Reverend Jim's family.  Taxi was a brilliant show and one of my all-time favorites.  If you are going to buy any of the existing three sets, this is the one to get.",1127260800,4,777,4.324137931034483
2345892,5,B000A0GOP0,"Taxi is among my favorite 70's sitcoms. Season 3 is without any doubt the funniest, I can't stop laughing. Christopher Lloyd cracks me up just looking at his face! It's good that we see more of him in this season. DeVito and Kaufman are as great. Don't get me wrong but the least funny in my opinion are Danza and Conaway. As for Hirsch and Henner, they both fit perfectly in the role of being ""normal"" among the cast.

Get it now, it is helarious! It washes away the blues.

If you're into 70's sitcoms, you might try Three's Company. And if you're into sitcoms in general, you should consider the best ones ever produced such as Seinfeld, Married With Children, Everybody Loves Raymond, Cheers and Cosby Show.",1127174400,,711,4.546875
2345893,5,B000A0GOP0,"This show will always be rated 5 stars.
I started watching the show in the mid 80's and sooner I found out that a lot of critics consider this to be one of the most special and well directed shows on Television
The third season will bring a lot of memories and although I mostly forgot most of  the plots on these episodes, I still remember some special scenes.

This is a list of the episodes in this season. By seing the titles some fans might even be able to recall some of the them:

1-Louie's Rival
2-Fathers of the Bride
3-Going Home
4-Elaine's Strange Triangle
5-Bobby's Roommate
6-Tony's Sister and Jim
7-Call of the Mild
8-Thy Boss's Wife
9-Latka's Cookies ( One of the most hilarious episodes )
10-The Ten-Percent Solution
11-Zen and the Art of Cab Driving
12-Elaine's Old Friend
13-The Costume Party
14-Out of Commission
15-Louie's Mother (Danny Devito'real mother stars in this one)
16-Louie Bumps Into an Old Lady
17-Latka the Playboy ( Andy Kafman bring to the show one of his famous characters. Vic Ferrari.)
18-Jim the Psychic
19-Fledgling
20-On the Job (Part 1)
21-On the Job (Part 2)

The third season is the best one in the whole collection. All of the characters in this show had a special part, specially the hillarious Jim Ignatowski. If you did not buy the previous two seasons, you can still buy this one and I can guarantee that It will never be late to start enjoying this show.
Television like this will never be produced again.",1124841600,8,1455,4.6061776061776065

It works fine on a DVD player but, although it plays fine on a Blue-Ray, it would not give me any closed captioning.  I bought the third season specifically because it offered closed captioning.  I almost returned it until I tried it on my DVD player.  Closed captioning worked just fine then.  I was relieved and very happy to be able to enjoy it with my limited hearing.
