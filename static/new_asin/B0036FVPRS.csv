4077723,3,B0036FVPRS,"They cut out the singing of ""O Canada"" by Nikki Yanofsky, which happens to be the best singing at the olympics (yet they put in the lame singing of ""O Canada"" at the end.",1273536000,,170,4.029411764705882
4077724,3,B0036FVPRS,"For the Olympic fan, all the major players are here : Lindsey Vonn, Apolo Ohno, Bode Miller, Shaun White, Evan Lysacek, Hannah Teter, and other individual performances and highlights from both hockey gold medal games and the gold metal runs in bobsled among other things. There's even a condensed version of the opening and closing ceremonies Still I can't help but feeling for $24.95 there could've been something more. There are no interviews with athletes and none of those really cool packages NBC produced during the Olympics that helped the viewer familiarize themselves with Vancouver. The lack of interviews baffle me though because NBC through their actual on-air coverage and the Today Show interviewed virtually every major U.S. star. (I think they even interviewed Lindsey Vonn's mom at one point.) For $24.95, I expect to see athletes reacting after their victories or defeats. However, if your looking for something to capture the spirit and emotion of the Olympics, this might be for you at a lower price.",1273363200,21,1020,5.11377245508982
4077725,2,B0036FVPRS,"I had read several other reviews for this dvd and was left unsure about it's content. Since it was cheap enough, I bought it anyway and I'll hold onto it. But I'm still mad I am unable to find a simple copy of the ENTIRE Opening Ceremony. So when it says ""Highlights"", It really does mean just snippets of clips. Some of the bands didn't even get to finish their songs. The OVER focusing on the US team was annoying too.",1360022400,,420,4.197530864197531
4077726,3,B0036FVPRS,"I was wondering: could someone who has seen this tell me; does this dvd contain k.d. lang singing ""Hallelujah""?  If not, does anyone know of a video I could buy that does contain that?  Thank you!!",1323216000,,197,4.444444444444445
4077727,1,B0036FVPRS,I purchased this video for the highlights from the opening ceremonies.  I'm very disappointed in the clips that are included.  I thought it would be a fun overveiw of Canada to use in my social studies class.  The artistic journey through Canada has been edited so that most of Canada is missing.  If you are interested in the opening ceremonies this is not the video for you.,1322006400,4,376,4.567164179104478
4077728,1,B0036FVPRS,"In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours.",1294963200,9,535,4.36
4077729,5,B0036FVPRS,"To the Americans reviewing this product, this is the CTV coverage of the 2010 Olymics. CTV is NOT NBC. You are watching a CANADIAN product. We do not want to see American highlights, that's what the NBC DVD collection is for. Please pay more attention to the products you are buying before you buy them.",1294012800,4,303,4.527272727272727
4077730,5,B0036FVPRS,Hi - love the DVD.  Opening and closing ceremony highlights were great.  Brought it all back.  Loved seeing Canada.  It went thru the highlights day by day.  Loved it but would have loved to see more Snowboard and skiier cross.  Its such an exciting sport and deserves more coverage.  Otherwise for a highlight DVD - AWESOME!!!  Glad I brought it - reasonable price.  I live in New Zealand and was abit worried the US DVD wouldn't play over here (did specify region 1) but not a problem.  Roll on Russia 2014.,1287619200,2,509,4.4945054945054945
4077731,1,B0036FVPRS,"Too little of the the major events that I was interested in, and too much of the little events",1281744000,2,94,4.0
4077732,2,B0036FVPRS,"It is difficult to find specific events in this DVD -- partly because the Main Menu is organized by Olympics Day 1, Day 2, and so on; and partly because some events simply aren't there.  Kim Yu-Na, for instance, is on the screen for only a few seconds. So don't look here for her world record-setting performances (or any other figure skating performances, come to think of it).  If you know what day the event you are looking for took place, that would help.  But there's still no guarantee that it would be included.

It seems that this DVD is meant for casual viewing.  If you would like some sports rumbling on your TV, and you aren't particular about what, then this might be for you.  It does include highlights of the opening and closing ceremonies, and of performances by Lindsay Vaugn, Shaun White, and Apollo Ohno.  But they are just highlights, and you have to take them as you find them -- that is, IF you find them.",1281052800,15,928,4.455621301775148
4077733,4,B0036FVPRS,"Overall the highlights edited together to give a sum-up of the Olympics was excellent. It only lacked giving a bit more highlight time to the figure skating.  It seemed to be almost omitted.  At least the winning performances would have been nice to see.
Everything else was great and certainly captured the feel of the Olympics, including the hockey, skiing, snowboarding, etc., as well as the beauty of Vancouver which is a wonderful city.",1277683200,4,441,4.945945945945946
4077734,1,B0036FVPRS,"I cannot begin to express my deep disappointment in this DVD, and with NBC for producing it. Yes, as another reviewer mentioned, all the major players are here- for about 15 seconds each. Most of the winning performances are truncated to the last few seconds. There are few reaction shots. There are no interviews with athletes or experts. There isn't any of the special coverage shown during the games.  Even the chapter page is amateurish: showing only a listing of the days whose ""highlights"" you can watch in that segment. This is the ""Cliff Notes"" version. Save your money.",1275782400,24,578,4.838383838383838
8389978,5,B0036FVPRS,Worth it just to have the scenes of Apolo's victories never mind all the rest. Such an awesome series of events.,1509753600,,112,4.380952380952381

8389986,2,B0036FVPRS,"I lived abroad during these Olympics so didn't get to see them at the time, and wanted to catch up on all the big names and stories before Sochi. Bought this a while ago (unfortunately at full price) and just watched it. Overall a really lame assortment of events and so much wasted time. I realize there's only so much space on one DVD, but... there was too much of the opening and closing ceremonies (did we really need to see every single second of Nelly Furtado and Bryan Adams at the expense of actual sporting events?), way too much of some boring woman sitting in front of a fireplace talking, way too many fancy graphics to introduce segments, and very little actual content. Each day's coverage begins with a hyper-fast jumble of the day's big stories. (Big stories, by the way, pretty much mean ""Americans you've heard of winning numerous medals"" except for a few special interest items.) If one of those stories was deemed worthy, then they show the winning run of the actual event. First of all, that means redundancy, which, again, so much wasted time. Second of all, it means, hello, spoilers. If you've just told me Lindsey Vonn or whoever wins a gold and shown her crossing the finish line, that takes all the excitement out of watching it again, duh. And third, the segments they chose... just... what were they thinking? Example: I know this was a big Olympics for Apolo Ohno, but do we need to see every. single. one. of his short track races? Especially at the cost of NO figure skating? Seriously, none. Not so much as one short program. Not even Evan Lysacek's program, which beat out Evgeni Plushenko against all odds. Talk about a big story. Take out the 6 slow-motion replays of Ohno pushing a competitor on the short track and you could've squeezed in Evan's medal-winning skate. There's even a chapter specifically called ""Figure Skating Highlights"" (all the other chapters are by day) and all it is is 3-second shots strung together with dramatic music and a voiceover. That's just mean. After sitting through the entire rest of the DVD going ""where is the figure skating?!"", then seeing that chapter and feeling relief, then to watch that useless 4 minutes, just made me mad. And there was less and less extended coverage as it wore on. Day 2 they show 3 or 4 full runs, by day 10, nothing. Honestly, it's like this thing was put together by an intern who got halfway through and went ""oh crap, I'm running out of space. Eh, no one cares about figure skating or luge or biathlon or skeleton or ice dancing or ski jump anyway, right?""

The only reason I give this 2 instead of 1 stars is because in the end I did learn just enough about what happened there to now recognize some of the names I'm seeing on TV as coverage gears up for Sochi. But it would have been awfully nice to actually get to see them compete and perform instead of hearing their names as a blip of them zips by and then cuts to Bode Miller for the fourth time.

NBC, if you're going to buy ALLLLL the rights to Olympic coverage, at least don't be so incredibly stingy and incompetent with the content. Lame, lame, lame.",1391040000,6,3118,4.526595744680851
8389987,2,B0036FVPRS,"Typical NBC fashion presentation, covering only a small portion of the games, and predominantly their own athletes. Baffled at the lack of hockey coverage seeing as it was clearly the marquee event of the games. Do not purchase expecting hockey, if one were looking for hockey from the games CTV has a full boxed set of the team canada games. Did have nice coverage however of the opening ceremony which was nice.",1360972800,,413,4.75
