3530002,5,B001DHXT48,I love this set.  AWESOME!  I don't understand the fuss about this set--it's still enjoyable throughout....,1220140800,4,107,5.625
3530003,2,B001DHXT48,"First some remarks about the series itself. This show proves that opposites may not attract, but, with some work, they can at least peacefully coexist. Felix is not just compulsively neat, he literally worships at the altar of order. Oscar's philosophy is not to sweat the small stuff and thinks everything is small stuff. One of the reasons this show is still funny today is that most people have personalities that lie between these two extremes and can therefore sympathize and laugh at the actions of both men. The first season focuses on the relationship between Oscar and Felix, pretty much stays in the same neighborhood as the 1968 movie from which it sprang as to storylines, and even has the same actresses from the film playing the Pidgeon Sisters. The first season is good, and helps establish the complete personalities of Oscar and Felix in a way a two hour film just doesn't have time to do, but I think it lacks something in the way of the energy and pace that the subsequent seasons had. ""The Odd Couple"" had the misfortune of premiering right before shows like ""All In the Family"" would give birth to modern television as we know it today, along with the frank discussion of controversial subject matter in a comic context.

Quite frankly, I think the show would probably have been canceled after its second season if it had not changed to the live set it used from seasons two forward and started breeching more modern topics like it did to help keep pace with the great changes that were taking place in television during the early 70's. I have to give credit to producer Garry Marshall - if he saw something that wasn't quite working in one of his shows, he wasn't afraid to make drastic changes to try and get things back on track. I would say that the ""Odd Couple"" is one of the few shows that managed to never jump the shark during its five year run. Considering the fact that it aired during a period of great change in American culture - 1970-1975 - that is saying something.

Now for the presentation of the series. The first season, which is probably its weakest, is the only one worth purchasing. If there are edits, I haven't noticed them. That is because the modern music starts getting inserted into the show in the second season, part of the effort that I previously mentioned to keep the show current. Unfortunately, it has also been its undoing in syndication and on home video. The RIAA, demanding outrageous royalties for anyone as much as humming a copyrighted song, ruined the video release of WKRP in Cincinatti, and is responsible for Ally McBeal on DVD being an impossibility in the U.S. If Paramount were to pay what the RIAA wanted, it would have to charge us two hundred per season. However, Paramount decided to deface this show anyway and release cut up sets from season two onward. That part of the blame definitely lies at their feet.

In short, avoid this set, and buy season one if you haven't. Subsequent seasons are so cut up it will ruin your enjoyment if you remember this series in its original run.",1219968000,35,3055,4.612132352941177
3530024,2,B001DHXT48,"I researched how much of the show was cut and it's not that much, only a few (maybe like 5) episodes actually have a joke setup cut out from under them. For about $30, that's worth it to me. But for God's sake, who designed this awful DVD box? There's nothing actually holding the ream of disks to the outer box shell, as you can see in my photo I actually accidentally lifted the entire blob out. In transit a couple disks apparently escaped and got scratched up, though seem playable. I've seen bootleg DVDs on the street that have better thought out freakin' disk holding mechanisms. Paramount, why?

Edit: Season 1 disk 1 ended up scratched enough I actually had to spend hours recovering the data from it. Three stars down to 2.",1516060800,3,733,4.470149253731344

3530028,5,B001DHXT48,"I worked in television for 62 consecutive years. I managed seven television stations across the nation from New York to San Francisco; some of these stations were  independent stations and, therefore, not affiliated with a major network. Independent stations were challenged by media buyers because their ratings were significantly below major network affiliates.  However, Fox became a major factor and so did streaming service Netflex.",1509753600,,437,5.707692307692308
3530029,4,B001DHXT48,"The only reason I didn't give this a full five-star review is that some of the episodes were cut.  This was very annoying, but in the last season when they had Giorgio Tozzi appearing, it made no sense for them to eliminate his rendition of ""Old Man River.""  He didn't sing at all!  For heaven's sake, the guy was an opera singer.  This was egregious!  Love the series, though.  Really would have liked to see the entirety of the several episodes that were truncated.",1509667200,2,467,4.5

3530032,4,B001DHXT48,"The first episode is so funny that I was crying while laughing.  The first 10 episodes are all funny.  Thereafter, the series declines, so that only about 1 episode in 3 is funny.  In the last season, most of the episodes were so mediocre or silly that I was wishing for the series to end.  There is a continuity problem in that several major supporting members of the cast appear or disappear from the series without explanation.  In the case of Oscar's secretary, she appears suddenly, then disappears seemingly permanently, then later reappears.",1504828800,,548,4.849462365591398

3530047,5,B001DHXT48,I have only just received my DVDs a few days ago and I can already say I don't think I will be leaving my house anytime soon. I am absolutely loving this box set so far especially the bonus disc with Jack and Tony's favourite episodes. The picture quality is great. I love that I own every episode and know I will never get tired of watching them over and over again. Thanks Amazon for shipping all the way down under to australia.,1503532800,,431,4.204819277108434

3530049,5,B001DHXT48,I purchased these DVD's for my 10 year old granddaughter. I noticed she was feeling bad and trying to change herself because she was so neat. I wanted her to know that it was okay to be neat. This Odd Couple series helps encourage that behavior. Both my 9 and 10 year old granddaughters love these DVD's.,1498953600,,304,4.350877192982456

The Collection Is Good, But The 5th  ( Final Season ) Has Some Glitches. Some Scenes Cut Off Before You Get To The End Of The Story. Maybe With Individual Seasons This Doesn't Happen.

3530054,5,B001DHXT48,"Love, love, love this show. I enjoy it more now than I did when I watched reruns as a kid. We love Tony Randall, so I went ahead and purchased the complete series. So glad I did! Once my kids got a feel for the characters, they loved it, too. They will actually rewind back to the funny parts to watch over. If you like Tony Randall and classic 70's shows, you don't be disappointed.",1495584000,,383,4.12
3530055,5,B001DHXT48,I absolutely loved this show when I was younger. I still love this show. Jack Klugman and Tony Randall had a definite chemistry. I watch this everyday. Fantastic purchase!!,1494892800,,172,4.9655172413793105
3530056,4,B001DHXT48,"Knowing that this set comes edited and not as originally aired, I had put off purchasing it for years. When the price dropped below $30, I decided to give it shot. I'm glad I did. As a casual fan, I haven't really been bothered by the edits or changes. Season 1-3 seem to be mostly intact. Seasons 4 and 5 are where I noticed some differences. If you're a purist or die-hard fan, I understand why you wouldn't purchase this set though. For the casual fan, I think it's well worth the price. The transfer to DVD looks good. The set also comes with some nice extra features such as commentary from Gary Marshall, interviews, and more. The only other negative besides the edits is that the packaging is quite poor. The plastic case is thin and flimsy. The disks are easily dislodged. All around, I give this set 4 Stars. Casual fans will really enjoy it, but purists might be disappointed.",1493856000,11,886,4.4753086419753085

3530071,5,B001DHXT48,"This is the complete package for The Odd Couple 1970. It is a comprehensive collection of all the episodes which are split around 4 discs per season. It includes some special features, commentaries and promo videos from the time it released 46 years ago. As a big fan of the series I am pleased with this product and I think it is done well. It is worth noting that the video is in a 4:3 format and NOT 16:9 widescreen. It is a standard 480p resolution, not high definition but that is to be expected. Overall I give this collection a score of 10.",1482624000,6,547,4.269230769230769

3530116,5,B001DHXT48,"While some reviews indicate the music is changed and some episodes have been edited, I don't easily see those differences.  It is not uncommon for those things to happen to keep the company from paying residuals or royalties.  I am happy to see many of the episode again in a economical package.  If I miss a joke or two edited out oh well.  But what a great program cast perfectly and the writing is the best. If you have mot seen the odd couple in a while this one is the best bar none of the other iterations of the play or TV series.  This one is so good they always think they can repeat it and they can not beat this team of Jack Klugman, Tony Randall, and Gary Marshall with all of the other top writing and performances.

I enjoy this show for what it doesn't have. It lacks what many sitcoms today have: hollow characters, re-hashed and overly-re-fried storylines and outdated plots, immature and boring cutesiness, and sadly neglecting any real or interesting direction, purpose, or meaning with characters, plots, or storylines (that usually match the corny acting).. This original is one of the greats that can hold up to even a British sitcom. Love the characters. Randall and Klugman seem to fit into (and stay in) their characters with polished acting, gliding skillfully through a scene, and you can enjoy each episode and laugh at and with both characters, all without having to be subjected to excessively hyper-sexed dialogue, soft-porn wardrobe, and embarrassing ignorance but sometimes also highly educated in all things dirty, including lopsided politics.",1468368000,2,995,5.343949044585988

I personally e-mailed Paramount Home Entertainment and asked for them to in the future release completely unedited versions in a complete series package like this. I figured I'll buy this now and give them a chance since they already somewhat re-released the series twice with some more footage so maybe in the future they will just do it again and release an even more complete package but hey this will do for now and I am enjoying the discs, I mean I bought this at what I feel was a decent price and yeah I hope they again re release it again later on I'm crazy enough to buy it again that's how much I love this show, I grew up watching this these guys so they are like my uncles I never had. : )",1437004800,4,865,4.154761904761905

3530204,5,B001DHXT48,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""The Odd Couple"" was one of those series.  Tony Randall played the fussy photographer Felix Unger to perfection.  Veteran character actor Jack Klugman became famous, playing sloppy sportswriter Oscar Madison.  Al Molinaro was hilarious as not tough-as-nails policeman Murray Greshler.  Episodes from the first season of the show stuck more closely to the famous play (and movie) written by Neil Simon, including the weekly poker games, and the Pigeon sisters.  From the start of the second season onward, the show was filmed in front of a live, studio audience.  In addition, the second season included the addition of the character of Oscar's secretary Myrna Turner, memorably played by Penny Marshall.  Highlights from season three include the episodes based on the game shows ""Password"" (with Allen Ludden and Betty White), and ""Let's Make A Deal"" (with Monty Hall).  Other episodes from various seasons featured a ballet dancer and opera singers, as a fun way to introduce them to a wider audience. By the fifth season, the storylines became more far-fetched, while the two main characters remained the quintessential neat freak and beer-drinking slob.  Unlike other series, ""The Odd Couple"" was able to tie up loose ends, concluding with Oscar getting his bachelor pad back as ""Felix Remarries.""

Bonus features include a gag reel, appearances by Tony Randall and Jack Klugman on ""The Mike Douglas Show,"" and a brief scene from a performance of Tony and Jack doing ""The Odd Couple"" on stage.  A few reviewers have complained about musical performances being edited out of some episodes.  To me, it wasn't a problem, with the exception of the season five episode ""Strike Up The Band Or Else.""  By editing out both performances of the song ""Cocktails For Two,"" the joke of Pernell Roberts singing that song at a country music square dance was lost, and the ending of the episode fell flat.  That shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing one of the best sitcoms in television history.  The most recent version of the complete series box set is very reasonably priced.  In addition, the discs are all in a single plastic case, which takes up much less room than the previous box set.  I'm sure Felix would approve of that change!",1436572800,4,2361,4.997442455242966

It's annoying when you look forward to certain scenes and they are just POOF Gone! From what I have been reading, it's all about music royalties. Seriously, the royalties can't be that much the songs were moldy oldies back in the 1970's for heavens sake.  I guess if you are on a long road trip and it's either watch Odd Couple or look out the window at nothing it's worth it, but other than that, save your money.",1435190400,4,546,4.45
3530221,4,B001DHXT48,"With all due respect to Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Art Carney, and other actors who have played Neil Simon's Oscar and Felix, Emmy  Award winning actors  Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the best ""Odd Couple"" ever! Even a quick look at the terrible 2015 TV reboot with Matthew Perry (Matthew Perry as Oscar Madison???!!!) and Thomas Lennon will convince you that Jack and Tony were and will always be the real deal. Paramount is hoping to cash in by reminding us of the real comedy gold of Jack and Tony by releasing all 114 episodes of the classic ""Odd Couple"" TV series (1970-1975) in a big box set. Think of Oscar and Felix, and you immediately think of Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. It is just that simple.
  Those hoping for more than before are bound to be disappointed. It looks like Paramount has released what it did before. I had only previously ordered Seasons 1 and 2, so I jumped at the chance to get the entire series in one. Season 1 is the only one to feature Bonus materials (short commentaries from Gary Marshall; but warm memories from the late and wonderful Jack Klugman, film clips, and a hilarious but short gag reel). Season 1 also includes a Bonus DVD of Jack and Tony's favorite episodes from the entire Series. But that that is all the Bonus Features included.
  This seems Odd indeed! The series actually gets better in Season 2. The laugh track was dumped and the series was filmed before a live audience at the insistence of Jack and Tony.
  I'm not one to complain about what is not here. The series itself, and the magical partnership of Jack and Tony, are what matters here. And it's all here, on 20 DVD discs in one big plastic box set. And the price is nice. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the misadventures and the supportive friendship between Oscar Madison and Felix Unger, those two most comically mis-matched roommates. Dear Oscar and Tony: Thank You both. We miss you. We'll love you always.",1434931200,9,1936,4.5590778097982705

3530223,5,B001DHXT48,"On the 3rd season so far and what can I say there are some portions that are edited. But in my opinion is still worth it especially when you consider the previous version costing you over $100 and this version at around $32 not too mention that this version is in fact edited but not as severely as the previous release! This package is in my opinion a beautiful collection to own especially for the price. I am not saying that people aren't right about edited versions being a huge mistake for such a wonderful show. However for all the years that I have waited to finally own this series and being able to laugh real hard once again  it's a real treat and I couldn't be happier! I will definitely give a more in depth review once I'm done watching all 5 seasons.
Update 07/01/15 - Just finished watching the final episode on season 5 and noticed unfortunately that the musical elements remained edited just like the previous release! Some of the episodes especially in season 5 end abruptly without explanation whatsoever? Not sure what paramount was thinking but it appears that they went ahead and repackaged the whole set and added a new picture for the cover case. However as I said before I am a huge fan of this show and it's my belief that they may have included bits and pieces of scenes that were never seen in the original show which may explain why the set has a longer runtime than the previous release. It's a speculation that this may be the case as its been many years since I saw this show aired but I am not entirely sure if what I'm saying is accurate? The best thing would be is for fans to take the chance in buying this set for the low cost only if the edited episodes won't absolutely disgust you! Still I left my 5 star rating because despite the edited episodes I get plenty of laughs from what I personally describe as one of the greatest show ever made and that to me is enough for me to appreciate this purchase!!",1434758400,36,1942,4.3646408839779

It really was a foolish, gutless, move by CBS/Paramount, in the first place.  Why worry about if we even need to get clearance on any of the songs that Tony Randall sings a few seconds of, let's just cut them all out!  Brilliant move!

3530321,5,B001DHXT48,"I gave this collection a FIVE star even thought it is really a Four for one reason. This series set is the ONLY and the LAST set you will get a chance to buy. The big media companies are NOT gonna keep spending money to put out this or a bunch of 40 year or older TV shows that all have an ever dwindling population of fans who MAY shell out $100+ to buy these. In fact this set was priced a lot higher and had to be reduced (big) to get them selling and now most are gone. Why does all that matter? Because even though this series set could be a bit better , if you are a fan you better not take the chance and let them go and then you never get a shot at a set again. The minor things that make this set not a 100% Top Shelf item in some people's minds are easily overlooked by me. So here are some sticklers complaints (not mine) #1 The intro song with the narration is not on the start of every single episode (so what) , some start with just the music. #2 There are several episodes where Felix sang some little 20 - 30 second song mostly at the end that are cut for some reason. #3 One of the most popular episodes with Pernell Roberts (sings that little 20 second song) at the end of the Barn Dance Party is cut off. These I can honestly say are the ONLY things I can see anyone could say a negative about.

3530328,4,B001DHXT48,"The Odd Couple is a show that was extremely popular at one time and now is hard to find. You can find fragmented episodes on YouTube that vary greatly in quality. Even when edited a better option would be a CD set like this one. The Odd Couple is one of the few shows, along with MASH that were successful spinoffs from a motion picture. It is very rare that a show that has two leads that would have almost perfect chemistry. Both Jack Klugman and Tony Randall have nearly perfect comic timing in this series. I would say these two leads are actually better than the ones in the Odd Couple motion picture.
Like most shows that have a cult following, the Odd Couple was not a big hit in its original run. It was not until syndication that the show became popular.

Some of the classic shows includes the password episode where Felix gives ridiculously obtuse clues to Oscar. The mystified expression on Oscar's face is priceless.  Another funny episode is when they have a funeral for a pet parrot. Felix is overly moved by the ceremony, where Oscar is indifferent and a little annoyed at the cost.

 I think one of the reasons this show has stood the test of time is due to the perfect casting of the lead characters, which is rare is any comedy show. There is nothing forced about their performances and chemistry. They are genuine human beings that we can relate to.  When they get themselves into certain situations we can relate to how they feel. The producers were lucky to get these actors at the height of their craft",1370995200,5,1525,4.471223021582734

I haven't seen the shows since the early 70's on our b&w tv set when I was a child so I didn't remember every show. It's nice to see them all in color of course.  Surprisingly, I did notice a few omissions in episodes 4 & 5. There are probably omissions in all the seasons but I didn't notice. The dvds worked perfectly with no defects. Since I read all the reviews here, I was aware there would be omissions & was hesitant to buy it but then decided some Odd Couple is better than none.

The only major film spinoff (other than M*A*S*H) to succeed on the small screen, JACK KLUGMAN and TONY RANDALL expertly inherited the roles of hard livin' slob sportswriter OSCAR MADISON and persnickity neat-nick photographer FELIX UNGER from the incomparable WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON...divorced men coping with each other's idiosyncrasies in a Big Apple apartment. Former joke writer GARRY MARSHALL executive produced, bringing in his then unknown sister PENNY as OSCAR's nasal-voiced secretary MYRNA TURNER, while AL MOLINARO's bumbling flatfoot MURRAY also figured prominently in the hijinks (both would turn up in future MARSHALL-produced sitcoms LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and HAPPY DAYS). Hilarity ensued in a weekly war of OSCAR's stogies, gastrinomic indecencies, and poker games vs. FELIX's fastidious housekeeping, champagne taste, and multitude of allergies. Often imitated but never duplicated (and in this case, unfortunately, edited), THE ODD COUPLE cleaned up for five funny seasons.

3530365,5,B001DHXT48,"Do not pass up the chance to own these seasons. I lived in New York and grew up with the re-runs. Personally, I find that some parts that people are complaining are edited are also replaced with scenes we did not see in the 70's. Keep in mind in re-runs, more commercials were added so parts were cut that were shown during their original run.
Also, it was rare they even released this. For years, they were even unavailable on Vhs. Then, Time Life put out only 10 tapes with 3 episodes and stopped leaving us 300.00 in a hole and only 30 episodes in. Then their was the dvr version available. So to finally see them professionally, in any form, is a real treat.
If you want to ever own them, now is the chance. Although they will probably stay in production, as a loyal fan, are you willing to give up the chance to own ""The Odd Couple""? I bought it 3 times now just to make sure I would never be without them. If you are a New Yorker, it would be like not owning ""The Honeymooners 39"". Do not listen to the reviews about not bothering to buy them. If this is what is available, then it is what it is. As well, the picture and sound are excellent. The individual boxes are professional. You won't have any regrets unless you are just a complainer and willing to spite yourself. Some would have nothing. And say ""I will show Paramount. Show them what?

Season 1 was originally put out by Time Life and had unedited episodes and extras.  The rest of the seasons put out by Paramount have no extras whatsoever.  Season 2 had no major edits - I think some unrecognizable background music was changed.  Seasons 3 - 5, the edits get worse and worse.  They are VERY noticeable.  For instance, there are scenes where someone will be in the middle of a sentence and the scene will just jump ahead.  Jokes and comedic timing are ruined, important scenes are left out.

I bought the first 3 seasons.  After noticing a handful of edits in the third season I decided to rent the rest first.  There are so many edits in the last two seasons, I refuse to buy them.  I would have never thought a show of this stature would be treated this way.  Word is Paramount also messed with the last few seasons of Cheers as well.

""CBS Home Entertainment opted to utilize the edited, syndicated prints, resulting in many episodes missing several minutes.

Not so - they've been completely edited out of the entire series. Surely that was part of the charm of the show - the expectation of hearing those words in the opening titles. In those few seconds the entire premise of the show is set up. Many other little things have been cut, clipped and altered in this DVD set and the other reviewers (on this listing and on the individual season listings) have touched on many of them. The one that bothers me is the complete removal of Pernell Robert's singing of ""In Some Secluded Rendezvous"" which is the whole punchline of the ""Strike Up The Band or Else"" episode during which, in the final seconds of the episode, he steals the theme song of Felix' band, The Sophisticados. It simply fades to black just as he's about to sing and that's the new ending of the show. That's all, folks. It just trails away to nothingness leaving us with a hopelessly lame ending never imagined by the original writers.
