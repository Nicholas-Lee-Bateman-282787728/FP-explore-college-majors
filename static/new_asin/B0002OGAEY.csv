I watched some of their clips on youtube: tangocity. They are very well explained and every minor move is shown in multiple angles with excellent explanation and demonstrations. My teacher said the couple are very professional Argentine Tango dancers. While other DVDs the previous reviewer mentioned are good too, but I think Osvaldo Zotto & Mora Godoy's is by far my personal favorite. Check them out at youtube and you will see why.",1234137600,4,579,4.979381443298969
8029834,3,B0002OGAEY,"An OK video to disc transfer. A bit dated now but that is no fault. Fine dancers. Contemporary greats of course but some teachers these days may balk at seeing finger prods and pushes used as leads, whether right or wrong. I love the three Carlos Gavito and Marcela Duran DVDs (one is shown below) and especially the 20 George Garcia and Christy Cote DVDs - their intensive 20 disc course on Argentine Tango. This DVD is fine if used with others, to see different styles but really, the most crucial thing is you must get real experience too, at tango workshops/seminars, but especially at practicas (and then, one day at actual milongas). I also recommend the Fabian Salas DVDs for really top class visual tuition, though there is only one Carlos Gavito!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vol-1-Tango-Lesson/dp/B000FEVQ18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vol. 1-Tango Lesson</a>",1203206400,,914,5.630434782608695
