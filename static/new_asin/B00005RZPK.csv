1658126,5,B00005RZPK,"I have been a long time fan of this band...and this is a good jumping off point if you are just getting into them...it starts at the beginning... the bands videos and their live performance are something every music lover should see. They are the most innovative band of the 80's. I own these both on VHS and am THRILLED to be able to get them together on one DVD finally!!!  BUY THIS, you won't regret it...trust me.",1010275200,,417,4.346153846153846
1658127,5,B00005RZPK,"Being a huge fan of Def Leppard, my opinion my be biased, but I must tell you, it's great to know that they're incredible stage show will be brought to the forefront of technology by being put on DVD.  I have seen many great bands play in concert; Aerosmith, Van Halen, Journey, Eric Clapton a few of these more than once...all were great performers.  But Def Leppard is something different.  They give it their all in their performance and never let up until the end.  This concert, In the Round, In Your Face, was recorded in their Pour Some Sugar On Me heyday and includes Steve Clark, their guitarist who died between the top selling Hysteria and Adrenalize.  Clark was a master of his low slung guitar and if it were possible for him to live on stage and play it every waking minute, he would surely be alive today.  This is a great concert movie.  They sound incredible, their stage show is high tech but not detached from their performance and you never get bored with their showmanship.  I only hope the transfer to DVD goes well.  I do own the VHS and I have watched it many times, enjoying it immensely.  Even if it is not being watched, listening to it is just as good.  Highly recommended, even for the casual fans of Def Leppard.",1006214400,4,1242,4.427312775330397

1658160,5,B00005RZPK,"I've had this release for many years already, but recently rediscovered it.  I was at this show on February 13, 1987 in Denver and the presentation on the DVD is fantastic.  Highlights for me during the show are ""Too Late For Love"", ""Die Hard The Hunter"", and ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"".  Rick Allen's drumming is unbelievable considering what he endured to make it back to the stage.  Steve Clark (RIP) and Phil Collen are the perfect guitar duo for their music.  Rick Savage does great holding down the bottom end (with Allen) and even does the acoustic guitar outro on ""Gods Of War"".  And Joe Elliot is in as good of vocal form as he ever has been--he even plays some rhythm guitar on a Steinberger during the ""Hysteria"" solo.

The only nugget missing on this release is Def Leppard's cover of CCR's ""Traveling Band"" during their last encore.

Two thumbs way up, five stars.  Enjoy!!",1466208000,,888,4.641025641025641

1658256,4,B00005RZPK,"I bought this compilation DVD because I have fond memories of the old MTV music videos of Photograph and Rock of Ages, and thought it would be cool to re-live my early teens. By the time Hysteria came around, I had lost interest in MTV, so the music videos and concert footage was brand new to me. This video clearly shows that these guys were seriously talented, and despite their tragedies (Clark's death and Allen's severed left arm) they were dedicated musicians. The only criticism I have is that this DVD often shows each member for only a split second, which can be annoying. For example, I would've liked to have seen Rick's drumming style in greater detail (how he's adapted after losing his arm) but got quick glimpses instead. However, this DVD is a worthwhile addition to anyone's collection. All of the hits are here!",1343001600,3,830,4.691780821917808

1658281,5,B00005RZPK,"This is an outstanding dvd, covering songs & videos of the original line-up of Def Leppard, with Pete Willis on guitar, before Phil Collen (Historia). Then you get the ""In the Round, in Your Face"" feature. In this feature, you get a full concert of Def Leppard, with their ""Great 80's classic line-up"" of Joe Elliott, Steve Clark, Rick Allen, Rick Salvage,& Phil Collen. This concert was from their 1988 ""Hysteria Tour"". This concert was filmed at the McNicols Arena in Denver, Colorada, on February 12, & 13 1988, with some footage shot at the Omni, in Atlanta, Georgia on October 7, 8, & 9, 1988. Then you get 5 music videos of the Vivian Campbell era of Def Leppard. So, this dvd covers a lot of material. All together, I think the approximate running time is around 177 minutes.

The song listings, & bonus material are described in the Amazon Product Description, so there's no need to repeat it here.

In my opinion, the ""In the Round/In Your Face"" Concert"" is one of the best ""hard rocking"" concerts, I've ever seen on vidio. These guys ""ROCK""!!! I really enjoyed watching the late/great Steve Clark play guitar, he had all the great moves, & he plays his heart out on the guitars he played in this concert. This shows Steve at his peak, to me he was one of the best Rock Guitarist ever. He's having fun & enjoying the concert. One such guitar, he plays in the concert was one of those double armed 18 string guitars. The rest of the band is fantastic also.

""In the Round/In Your Face"" got that name because the stage was round, and in the center of the Arena, so the audience were all around them.

Some of my favorites from the concert include ""Too Late For Love"", ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak"" (both of these include excellent guitar work from Steve, & Phil), ""Foolin"", ""Armageddon It"", ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"", & the ""classic"" ""Rock of Ages"".

I've been a fan every since, I first heard them on the radio, back in the early 1980's.

I highly recommend this dvd!!!! Thanks!!!!",1268092800,5,1986,4.533519553072626
1658282,5,B00005RZPK,It was fun to see Def Leppard when they were so young with so much talent. The history line was good for collectors like me but my favorite was the live performance In the Round in Denver.  The production was so well done I feel as though I am there.  Electrifying live performance. Phil Collens solo was unbelievable. Joe's voice was perfectly tuned.  What a range,1262995200,,365,4.5
1658283,4,B00005RZPK,"Having been someone who listened to The Pretenders, The Clash, English Beat, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson, XTC etc... at the time Def Leppard came onto the scene. I really never paid them much attention. But they were there, on MTV and could not be ignored, more than I realized. This movie helped me get to know a band I never thought I cared about, and made me care. I gained respect for them because of their musical and personal journeys. And most importantly they stood by Rick, which says a lot about them as people. The acting and script were good. The story ends before their current guitar player, Vivian joined the band.",1223769600,,629,4.575221238938053

The ""Historia"" videos run the gamut from 1980's ""Hello America"" to the band's No. 1 hit ""Love Bites"" from 1988. Between videos is a recap of Leppard's career at various stages, creatively enhanced by ragtime piano heard on a scratchy record and words across a scratchy brown screen meant to imitate a silent movie. As for the videos, it's cool to watch the band in all its youthful enthusiasm on such great early songs like ""Let it Go,"" ""Foolin'"" and ""Women."" Def Leppard have always been an exciting band to watch live, whether on a normal stage or ""in the round,"" and some of the band's videos by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pyromania/dp/B000001F2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pyromania</a>&nbsp;era bordered on cutting edge for the time period. These days, it might be easy to smirk a little at some of the over-the-top lip-syncing performances that Def Leppard employed in videos such as ""Photograph,"" ""Foolin'"" and ""Rock of Ages, but, put in a historical context, those clips portrayed Leppard as a force to be reckoned with and really paved the way for future heavy metal video performances by lesser bands. From ""Hello America"" to ""Pour Some Sugar on Me,"" it's interesting to see how massively Leppard progressed in terms of its musical direction and the depth of its stage performance. The band's tendency toward darker-themed videos -- whether set in Victorian times with owls and women in cages or with flashing lights abounding and skulls in the background -- ironically set the stage for what would be a morbid period later on, when drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash.

Undoubtedly, the best video Leppard ever put out was ""Me and My Wine"" from 1984. This was in the days when everyone in the band wholeheartedly indulged in crazy extracurricular activities, and boy does it show in this clip, where everyone looks severely (but happily) strung out. Filmed in ""Paddy Freeny's mother's house"" and in homage to Britain's great television series ""The Young Ones,"" this video truly captures the band at a refreshingly raw and wild period that it never really returned to in such an unbridled fashion. Plus the video is just hilarious...watch it and see. Viewing Leppard's much slicker videos later on, you wonder a bit where the spontaneous atmosphere went.

The highpoint of this DVD, however, is not the band's videos but the live performance it puts on in ""In the Round..."" This portion of the DVD leads off with a frantic trip around the arena (mostly in black and white footage) as the crowd files in and the stage is being set up earlier on, all to the rhythmic, mesmerizing beat of ""Rocket."" The band looks excitable before the show (no pun intended), and the arena-sized crowd is pumped to the gills. This was back in the days when rock bands truly were larger than life, thanks in part to MTV, and if you're a fan of Def Leppard, then the hyped lead-up to the performance is pretty magical. As the band waits behind a massive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hysteria/dp/B000001FKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hysteria</a>-sewn curtain in preparation for ""Stagefright,"" the leadoff song of the night, Clint Eastwood's famous ""do you feel lucky"" dialogue infiltrates the arena in a foreboding way, revving the crowd up more. Once the curtain drops, the band doesn't let up for one moment, running around the colorful stage as if its collective life depended on it. Fourteen songs, practically all of them well-known hits, rockers and ballads, keep the audience entertained throughout the duration. A highlight for me is the guitar intro to ""Gods of War,"" performed by the late great Steve Clark. Following the ""nuclear war"" outro of that song is ""Die Hard the Hunter,"" and to see the stage go dark and Rick Allen looking up toward the heavens between songs is priceless. To me, it's the apex of the concert.

After all this video and live-performance mayhem, the bonus material is a bit of a letdown. Sure, videos like ""Promises,"" ""Slang"" and ""Work it Out"" are good songs inside of glossy, high-tech video productions, but somehow none of it matches the earlier footage that was so invigorating. Interestingly, the sappy ballad ""Goodbye"" is somehow enhanced a bit by the equally corny video.

Though duller than the multiple videos and live mayhem onstage, the band interview is also kind of cool to watch. The guys talk about playing live in the round, making videos (including ""Me and My Wine"") and staying musically current. Just as they are on stage, the guys seem enthusiastic and still glad to be a band. If you like Def Leppard's music, this DVD is a must-have.",1195862400,,5584,5.541617819460727
1658285,5,B00005RZPK,"Combining two earlier VHS release Def Leppard have put together a very good package here as it represents real value for money for the person wanting to replace those old worn out videos. The two VHS releases put into this package are the band rockumentary/history lesson release Historia which includes 18 video clips from the bands earliest full length through to the mega hit from their Hysteria album, Love Bites.

As a collection on it's own I'd give Historia four stars, easily. The band gloss over nothing, showing the dodgy videos in their past (Hello America) but also some darn fine riff heavy rockers like Let It Go and High `n' Dry and the slow morphing into a different style of band with the Pyromania release and thence onto the polished leviathan that was the Hysteria era product. And I really have to give a special shout out to the Me and My Wine clip inspired by the hit British comedy series The Young Ones. Regardless of what era of the band or what your personal faves are the Historia collection is an excellent idea and well thought out.

As for In The Round In Your Face - the almost inevitable live documentation of the Hysteria tour - this on it's own would probably rate around 3.5 stars depending on your mood or preferred era of this long serving band. At fourteen songs long the quality is there - I mean I own Gamma Ray DVD's transferred over from prior VHS releases and the darn things total 55 minutes and that includes interview snippets!  The set leans heavily on Hysteria and Pyromania songs which makes perfect sense and the show is as polished as you'd expect. It may lack somewhat in spontaneity and heads down grit but the thing is well produced and looks very crisp.

But what also helps this release to hit the heights of five stars is the bonus material on hand. Going along with the theme of collecting a bunch of their stuff together, we get videos for some of their later singles such as Slang and All I Want Is Everything, five videos in total and as the band point out in the interview also included in the special features, this is perhaps the first time some people got to see these videos given how grunge killed MTV's desire to cover any other genre of hard rock and metal. Lastly a discography up to the time of release is included. The only possible downside I can see to any of this material is that some of the videos would certainly be available on some of the other DVD releases this band has put out in the ensuing years.

Regardless, for any Def Leppard fan, even only casual fans who just liked the radio hits, this is a very good buy. It not only gathers up two older VHS releases in one convenient format but it also has worthwhile extras. And a menu that's easy to navigate doesn't hurt either. Recommended rock music.",1195171200,,2784,4.483234714003944
1658296,5,B00005RZPK,"Def Leppard are recorded live on video for the first time from their 1987-88 in-the-round concert tour supporting the release of their long-awaited Hysteria album.  The concert is filmed on location from McNichols Arena in Denver, Colorado with additional footage from The Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia.  If you've never seen Def Leppard in concert, I strongly urge you to purchase this video as it captures the band performing all their hits from Hysteria, Pyromania, and High 'N' Dry.  This is Def Leppard at their best performing to an audience of mostly teenage girls.  Their performances are energetic and entertaining and never slow down or get boring.  They really know how to rock like nobody's business.

But, now on DVD, the quality is a bit better, the sound rules, and the 5 bonus videos, (work it out, Slang, all I want is everything, promises, goodbye), round out a great def leppard collection.  Historia contains earlier versions of videos and my personal favorite leppard song video, Rock Rock, which was only released in Japan on video, and on historia for our viewing pleasure. So, must have for the Leppard fans, check it out, great value too here on amazon. Also pick up the Visualize/VideoArchive DVD to round out the Leppard DVD collection, and don't forget the Rock Of Ages DVD.",1177545600,,668,4.911504424778761

We are quite pleased with this purchase. Wish there was more video/concert footage from the Def of old, so if anyone knows of any other out there, place a post. Is it just me, or does anyone else think that Joe Elliot needs to go back to the dark hair? I always thought that he looked better before he started dying the hair. Just my opinion. Also, anyone that can drum with one arm is pretty darn impressive. A DEFinite must see!!",1169683200,,570,4.098214285714286

1658301,5,B00005RZPK,"This CD is absolutely awesome!!!  It starts with the progression of video tapes from raw talent to the band at the top of their game!  Gives me flashbacks to the days when MTV actually played videos!  I fell in love with Def Leppard in 1981 and they still are #1 with me (an honor they hold with Bon Jovi- who I saw the first time in 1983).

  The video portion is followed by an exciting, adrenaline pumping, testosterone flowing concert in the round.  I crank it up loud on my Cerwin Vegas and suddenly...I'm there...back with my ""big hair"" in the best decade in my life.  This is a treasure to keep for all times.  It's a shame that such a talented handsome genius,Steve Clark, had to leave us so soon.

  The special features add bonus videos along with interviews with the band members.  You will not be disappointed and will want to see this video over and over!!!!",1169078400,3,871,4.40251572327044
1658302,4,B00005RZPK,"I previously purchased another dvd, Def Leppard Rock of Ages and was pretty disappointed.  As a a huge fan of the first 3 installments from Def Leppard I was looking for footage and concerts from Pre-Hysteria.

This DVD, while not completely comprehensive, offers up a lot of what I was looking for.  Including a set (Die Hard the Hunter) from the Hysteria tour at the now defunct McNichols Arena in Denver.

The early videos really brought me back.  Hello America and Let It Go were great.

Hopefully, Def Leppard puts a few more concerts out on DVD for fans of their earlier work but for now this works.",1168905600,,605,4.555555555555555
1658303,5,B00005RZPK,"I haven't got much to add to the other reviews, what can I say Def Leppard Rocks!!  This DVD is an exceptional value for any Def-head!

There are 2 complete videos on the DVD both Historia and In the Round/In Your Face in their entirety - amazing!  Plus a bunch-o-bonuses, interviews and some of their newer videos.

I had one point of confusion, though.  According to the other reviews the video for 'Rocket' is, sadly, not present on the DVD - or it's really hard to find...

The reason I wonder is because in the DVD case insert liner notes, at the bottom of the HISTORIA page there is this statement:

""All Videos (copyright) 1988 Bludgeon Riffola Ltd., except 'Rocket' (copyright) 1993 Bludgeon Riffola Ltd., and Videos 19-23 (copyright) 2001 Bludgeon Riffola Ltd.""

This indicates that the 1993 'Rocket' video is somewhere on the DVD...

Any thoughts?  I can't find the 'Rocket' video.  Is this A) a typo B) a cruel plug for the other DVD that DOES have the Rocket vid, or C) alluding to what sounds like the intro for 'Rocket' in the opening track of 'In the Round in Your Face'

This is a 5 outta 5 without it but I could give it a 6 outta 5 if anyone can explain...

1658308,5,B00005RZPK,"Def Leppard is my favorite band of all time and always will be!!!  I have both Historia and In The Round In Your Face on VHS and when it came to a DVD collection, I bought it right away!  Historia is the best music video collection I have ever seen or owned.  It has all the videos from the 80's except Rocket but that's on my other DVD Visualize/Video Archive so it's not a big deal.  The music videos are Hello America (their very first video), Let It Go, High 'N' Dry, Bringin' On The Heartbreak with Pete Willis, Photograph, Rock Of Ages (one of my favorite videos because it reminds me of a movie, it's just really cool to watch), Foolin', Too Late For Love, Rock! Rock! (Til You Drop), Bringin' On The Heartbreak with Phil Collen (another cool video and Bringin' On The Heartbreak happens to be my 3rd fav rock ballad of all time!!), Me And My Wine (a really funny and cool video and it was taped in a house and I have a feeling it's in England and it's really cool, the song isn't available on any U.S. CD's so I had to order an import CD but the song is awesome!), Women (I'll tell you, this video is one of my all time favorite videos because of the way Joe Elliott sings and moves and looks and it's cool seeing this boy with this comic book in it that is telling a story about what the song is about, it's just a really cool video and it's one of my fav's!!), Animal (another favorite video where they're at the circus!!), Pour Some Sugar On Me (the U.K. video that I don't think was ever shown even in England but I could be wrong and I totally love this video because it's very humorous with the guys playing the music, Joe singing in this house and this woman who I guess is a neighbor is trying to just destroy this house where the Leps are performing and it's very funny at the very end.  I think MTV should have played this video because in some ways, it's better than the other one and this video was also for the album version of the song), Hysteria (another favorite, it's cool to see Joe wearing a suit), Armageddon It (the Live video that was shown on MTV and again, one of my fav's), Pour Some Sugar On Me (the U.S. version, MTV video and the song happens to be my favorite song of all time from Def Leppard and I love both versions of the song, the video version and album version), and Love Bites (this song is my favorite rock ballad of all time and I love the video, it plays after the end credits and it's cool to see the words ""If You've Got Love In Your Sights, Watch Out, Love Bites"" on the screen right before the song comes on).

I love how they made the Historia where they have this old-style music playing in between almost every music video and they have this information on the screen and it's made to look like it's the 20's or 30's or something and it's very artistic, I love it!!
I love all the music videos from Historia and wish they would do more videos like it today!!!  These videos are so much better than anything that has been out in over a decade!!!

The live performances from In The Round In Your Face are awesome and there is a very funny part where Joe talks after one of the solos and it's how he says it that makes it so funny.  All the songs live are Stagefright (the perfect show opener because in the lyrics it says ""Welcome To My Show"", awesome!!), Rock! Rock! (Til You Drop), Women, To Late For Love, Hysteria, Gods Of War, Die Hard The Hunter, Bringin' On The Heartbreak, Foolin', Armageddon It, Animal, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Rock Of Ages, and Photograph.  There are also a few solos throughout the concert and it's really cool.

There are some bonus videos for Slang, Work It Out, All I Want Is Everything, Goodbye, Promises and an interview and discography.

This DVD collection is a must buy for any Def Leppard fan in addition the DVD of Visualize/Video Archive and I also have the Classic Albums Hysteria DVD that has the making of the album.  These 3 DVDs are must buy's for any Def Leppard fan!!

It's kind of strange how it's twice as expensive in the US, when usually music and DVD's are twice as expensive in Mexico (especially with imports).

Concerning the DVD itself, it has great classic videos from the era when MTV was cool (all videos and no reality ""shows"") and a rockin' concert filmed mostly in Denver. I saw them live in Monterrey, Mexico in their 1993 Adrenalize tour and they ruled!!

1658311,3,B00005RZPK,"If you're a Def Leppard fan I still recommend this DVD. If for no other reason than it being so much easier, on DVD rather than VHS, to skip around both recordings to play your favorite tracks.

Unfortunately though, there's little extra. They did include a few videos from Slang, which is nice because, like most fans, I never saw these on MTV. There's also a ten minute or so interview with the band, but its reveals absolutely nothing new. AND the interview takes place in the corner of some office with a shakey camera and almost unbearably bad, echoey, open-mike audio!

Also the DVD transfer is mediocre at best. It doesn't look like they bothered striking a fresh print from the film negatives for this DVD release. Its not much better than if you captured & burned your own DVD from your VHS copies!

But, as I said, if you're fan its still worth buying now, because I doubt any improved, 'Special Edition' versions will ever come out after these.",1092182400,16,955,4.573099415204679
1658312,4,B00005RZPK,"I am a huge fan of Def Leppard and when I first seen this DVD, upon looking at the video tracklisting on the back, I knew right away I had to get it. It has (nearly) every video I've ever wanted from the band that I've only been able to catch on MuchMusic/MTV by chance. The DVD quality is decent even on the older videos.
As far as the videos go, I am impressed to see that they actually did a video from thier 1980 debut album (Hello America) despite the fact that they seem embarrased by thier early years. It was also a nice treat to see the U.K video version of Pour Some Sugar On Me, which i've never seen here in North America, as well as the Bringing on The Heartbreak remix version 2 (with Phil Collen instead of Pete Willis on guitar) which aren't aired on North American music TV, or at least not that I've seen. And my personal favourite, ""Work It Out"", this video I've never been able to get my hands on until now and I think seeing that alone on the back of this box grabbed me and I had to own this. The additon of 1996-1999 video era is great too, but....
Why are the 5 videos spanning SLANG and EUPHORIA tacked on as ""bonus"" material? In think they should have been added on in the same chronological order as the rest of the videos were. Hell, the card within the DVD box lists them as being right along with the other videos, but upon viewing the disc, you see that they are bonus material and thats not really where they should, though I guess considering how rare ""Work It Out"" is.
The other problem I have with the videos is the quite noticable lacking of videos from 1992-1995 (gems like ""Tonight"", ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"", ""When Love and Hate Collide"", etc..) I mean true they are featured on Visualize but come on, why break it up like that?
The live performances are nice to have as well, I wouldnt watch them often though because I am not a huge fan of live stuff. I think my only other beef is lack of some really other special bonus material, and I was a little disapointed that there wasn't more interview time dedicated to the band, or past interview segments to feast on. Oh well this DVD is still top notch and I recommend it to anybody, it has tons of great videos, some you may have not seen before, the live footage is decent too, it only really lacks in the ""bonus"" section but then alot of DVDs do anyway.
I'm going to check out VISUALIZE to further add to my Def Lep DVD collection. You should add this too.",1083974400,5,2460,4.213983050847458
1658313,5,B00005RZPK,"Def Leppard was a weird band. Yeah they rocked and had a recognizable sound that was all theirs, but they changed after Pyromania. Their first three albums they were a 'guys' band. Starting with 'Hysteria' they became a 'girls' band. After Pyromania and the accident that caused the drummer to lose an arm, it seemed like forever before the Def Leps had their new album. In fact they were all but written off and forgotten about and then 'WHAM'! Hysteria came out and they were on the radio and MTV every 10 minutes.
The videos are good (Photograph), some are cheezy (Rock of Ages) and some gave you an idea of what the Hysteria Tour would be (Pour some Sugar on Me). The Hysteria concert is very well done. The film crew did a great job with the rotating stage and all. Def Leppard weren't for everyone, but we all remember the girls who went nuts for their new 'Hysteria' sound. Even today my chicks gets all weak in the knees when 'Pour some Sugar on Me' is blaring from the TV set.",1079308800,2,985,4.387978142076503

Although I admire the band for carrying on after Steve Clark's death, in my opinion, the spirit of Def Leppard died when Steve Clark passed on. I think the band came up with a great idea when they released all four of their longform videos on two dvd's. Two for the price of one! I bought both dvd's, including ""Visualize/Video Archive"". Speaking as a Steve Clark fan, I highly recommend this particular dvd!",1078099200,4,567,4.461538461538462
1658315,5,B00005RZPK,"The DVD package of Def Leppard's HISTORIA/IN THE ROUND IN YOUR FACE is hard rock at its finest!
First, there's the HISTORIA program, which is a treasure for any fan of 1980s hard rock or rock of any era.  Lots of classics such as ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"" and rarities, including ""Me & My Wine"": A great rock song and amusing video.
Then, there's the awesome concert video IN THE ROUND IN YOUR FACE...  During the band's Hysteria Tour, the band seems more energetic than ever!  (Certainly more than in their ARCHIVES video, which I also recommend.)  Here, the band is at the peak of their hard rock creativity.  The band's entrance is spectacular and they just keep going!  This was at the time when guitarist Steve Clark was with DL and let me tell you... He is a wild man on stage who really adds to the show!  It is a shame that he passed on.  God rest his soul.  This tour also marks the triumphant return of drummer Rick Allen after his unfortunate accident.
The concert was filmed at McNichols Arena in Denver Colorado in which the band's stage is in the center, which allows not only the band to be more personal with the crowd, but provides a much bigger and better sound!  Every song is a knockout!  Also, there is another element that ARCHIVES does not have...  Guitar solos!  Steve Clark performs a brief solo intro to one of the songs, but Phil Collen gives a more lengthy solo that is sure to please...  ""Loud and proud... !"" as vocalist Jim Elliot states.
The special features include interesting interviews with the band members and bonus music videos that express the band's diversity.  All great songs, keeping in mind that not every song is going to sound like it belongs on the Hysteria album.

1658317,4,B00005RZPK,"First of all, this DVD is split into two halves--one has a collection of DL's videos and the second half is a 1988 live show from Denver, CO.  For those people that are pushing the big 3-0 and were growing up when DL was big, this first half of the DVD will bring back some MTV memories for sure.  It's fun to watch the videos one more time, but they seem a bit so ""glam"" and 80's cheesy.  I remember them being very cool when I was in high school, but they seem awfully lo budget now.
  BUT, the concert is where this DVD starts picking up!  I never thought that DL got the respect it deserved and this DVD backs up my opinion.  They really are a good rock and roll band in its PRIME in the late 80's.  The DVD is worth having just for that fact alone.  Also, they really start to cook in the 2nd half of the concert.  Very underrated band that definitely give an excellent high-energy performance in the live show.

1658323,3,B00005RZPK,"I was a big Def Leppard fan in the '80s, up to and including ""Hysteria"", but things kind of fell off after that.  ""Adrenalize"", ""Slang"", and ""Euphoria"" all fell WAY short of the classic Def Leppard that was evident in their previous work.  This DVD collection of concert footage and music videos is interesting because of the dated look of the footage itself.  It all looks stuck in the '80s, which is the strongest reminder that they hit their peak some 15 years ago.  Sure, die-hard Leppard fans are gonna disagree with me on this.  But this DVD collection is more of a curious time capsule than anything else.  They may have had their ""own sound"", but it was too formulaic after a while.  I think they exhausted the best of their creativity as songwriters by the time they started their follow-up to ""Hysteria"" -- they didn't have much left to say.  They were one of the prototypical hair bands during their heyday, but it looks silly now.  As much as I love the material up through 1987, it is almost painful to watch the videos and concert footage.  Truth be told, I bought this DVD so I could burn the songs onto blank CD's and listen to them in my car.  I don't think that the videos or concert footage have aged well.
You like Def Leppard?  Buy this DVD for the songs, in particular the older pre-""Adrenalize"" stuff.  The video footage hasn't aged well, though.",1024272000,4,1369,4.493927125506073

A couple nitpicks: I know the videos they included only go to 1988, but I really wish the ""Rocket"" video was on this DVD.  It was effectively from the same era as the other material included here, but instead appears on the ""Visualize / Video archive"" DVD instead.
Also, the highly-touted ""interview"" on the DVD is really nothing at all.  It shows the five guys sitting in a cluster of chairs, talking about making these DVDs, the videos, touring, etc.  But the whole ordeal lasts less than five minutes.  It is significantly less than I had hoped for.  Oh well.
By the way: Joe talks about how he hates to perform ""Photograph"" live, because it's so hard to get a chance to breathe while singing it.  Why don't they come up with a new arrangement of the song for performing live?  It would be great to do something new with that old recognizable classic.",1016323200,2,1128,4.436893203883495

1658332,5,B00005RZPK,"The band has released ALL their music (promotional) videos, from 1980 to 1988, on this one sided disc! The band has, also, released their ""In The Round"" concert video, from the 1987-1988 Hysteria tour, on this same one sided disc! How did they manage to pack all of that into one side of a single DVD disc???? Amazing!!!! This awesome DVD has 3 hours of lethal DEF LEPPARD stuff! If you're a die-hard fan of the band, like I am, you'll purchase this, like, IMMEDIATELY!!!! I've seen it and am raving about it!!!! I have Hysteria, evidently! Get your's TODAY!!!!",1016236800,4,561,4.62
1658333,5,B00005RZPK,"This DVD is loaded full of music videos, interview footage, an entire live concert and extra videos from 'Slang' and 'Euphoria'.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT.  I own just your regular twenty-five inch, concave television set with your ordinary cheap speakers, right?  Well, when I popped that Def Leppard DVD in my player and I punched in the ""Promises"" video with my remote, the sound could have damn near well have exploded the woofers.  Amazing sound.  There is over three hours of videos on here, and anything a fan of Leppard could ask for.  Even if you already own the videos, the sound and picture quality ALONE is worth shelling out the extra dough for the DVDs, not to mention the bonuses.  Besides, don't you ever get tired of fast fowarding and rewinding all the time?...Thank God for DVD players.",1016150400,,811,4.75
1658334,5,B00005RZPK,"I have the video tapes, I have the laserdiscs, now I have the best version of them all.  The band did a fantastic job with these DVDs.  These are a great buy and a great gift idea for anyone who loves great music.  Keep the Faith.",1015977600,2,230,3.9565217391304346
1658337,5,B00005RZPK,"I HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THESE. BOTH DVD'S ARE GREAT.  THE SOUND IS TERRIFIC, YOU HAVE 4 VHS TAPES ON TWO DVD'S AND THE EXTRAS ARE COOL.  ALL LEP FANS ARE GLAD TO GET THE 5 RECENT VIDEOS THAT DIDN'T GET PLAYED.  THE DVD IS WELL WORTH BUYING AND GETTING REINTRODUCED TO ONE OF THE BEST ROCK BANDS OF THE AGES.",1015804800,,313,3.9365079365079363
1658338,5,B00005RZPK,"OK, there are so many great features about these DVDs but I will try to shorten this since there is a limit.  For one thing, a full collection of ALL Def Leppard promo videos, along with a ton of additional features adding up to almost 8 hours of Def Lep entertainment for [some money] is an absolute steal!!!  Another special feature is that you can watch (over and over) videos that we've been waiting up to 6 years to see...Slang, Work It Out and Promises among others!!  This can be watched on a DVD player or on the computer while writing a review on Amazon (Goodbye just finished)!!  Since MTV (And VH1 hopefully only until the X album is released) never show DL, this is the perfect chance to get our fix!!  As an owner of all 4 videos, I no longer worry about wearing out my tapes since I have them on the almost impossible to ruin DVD format.  Almost all fans will recognize the songs on Historia - In The Round DVD combo, but don't overlook the material on the Visualize - Video Archive DVD, especially the accoustic show at the end!!  The deal of the year for Music DVD, and hopefully a springboard to big things for Def Leppard in 2002 and beyond!!!!",1015200000,5,1162,4.351851851851852
1658339,3,B00005RZPK,"The content on both of the Def Leppard videos is fantastic. My only problem with them is the user-friendliness of the DVDs themselves. The only way to jump from chapter to chapter is by pressing the fast forward button. You cannot access a scene by simply entering the chapter number. Thus, if you are on ""Hello America"" and want to jump to ""Love Bites,"" you got some serious clicking to do.
Fans of the VHS copy of Historia might be a little disappointed to see the DVD does not contain the silent movie-like titles between the songs that gave some information on each clip.
The reported band commentary tracks did not make the final cut. A few minutes of band interviews is about all the extra features you can expect on these discs, although it is great to see the videos from Slang and Euphoria!!!",1015200000,2,801,4.531034482758621
1658340,3,B00005RZPK,"I love Def Leppard, and make no mistake, its GREAT having both of these in a single DVD but I must say that I am a bit disappointed in the release.  Only 2.0 STEREO?  With a DVD like this there is no excuse whatsoever not to have ATLEAST a 5.1 Dolby mix with a DTS (ES?) being optimal.  So after all the delays this has gone through the best they can do is offer a highly inferior sound mix like this?  Absolutely ridiculous...
Yet I will still buy it simply to have a copy of Historia that I will not have to worry about my VCR eating while I watch it.",1015113600,8,553,3.954954954954955
1658341,5,B00005RZPK,"Breathtaking...I love the rendition of ""Bringing on the Heartbreak"" while Steve was still in the band (may he rest in peace) on the ""In the Round, In Your Face"" half of the DVD...the sound is amazing...the picture is remarkably good for how old the actual film is...and the same old feeling from watching Def Lep in concert is still there and better than ever. I also purchased the Visualize/Video Archive DVD that was released on the same day which is also great...but I like the Historia/In the Round, In Your Face a little better due to the fact that it has a few more special features included in it in comparison to the other DVD...both are HIGHLY recommended for any and all Def Lep fans out there. Gunter glieben glauchen globen...DEF LEPPARD FOREVER!!",1015113600,,759,4.714285714285714

1658343,5,B00005RZPK,"How can you think of the 80's and not think of Def Leppard? The pioneers of hyped up, laser drenched, echo filled, arena rock! Hysteria is one of the greatest Rock CD's of all time, and now it's video compliments are finally here in the digital world for us to enjoy! I remember back when the VHS tapes were each released, and the excitement of rushing home to throw them in my VCR. And I must say I did the same with this DVD, and have not been disappointed in the least. The sound absolutly rocks, and the interactive menus are nice as well. So nice in fact, that I wish the main menu was a screen saver! Hehe If you'e seen the flashing lights and pulsing sounds of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" in the menu and are a hard core fan like me, I'm sure you can relate. I can't wait to check out the Visualize/Video Vault DVD to see the other half of the Def Interview, and all the other timeless goodies that await me! Keep the faith Def Fans! Def Leppard X will be out soon!!! :-)",1014854400,2,974,4.104712041884817
1658344,5,B00005RZPK,"Didn't get to see Def Leppard in concert?  You can now!  Their revolutionary ""In The Round In Your Face"" video sets you in the best seat in the house to see this great band perform their earlier hits.  Filmed during the ""Hysteria"" tour they are pitch-perfect and constantly in action, moving from one side of the stage to another, and another.  You'll feel like you're there too as you hear the swell of the cheering crowd as Joe Elliott introduces Rick ""The Thundergod"" Allen, and see Steve Clark and Phil Collen's amazing guitar expertise, with Rick Savage's throbbing bass.
 Better looking than their VH1 ""Hysteria"" Movie counterparts, and better sounding than anybody performing today, you have GOT to buy this concert video.",1011484800,5,729,4.942622950819672
1658345,5,B00005RZPK,"As a younger fan of Def Leppard, it is exciting to finally have the DVD version of my VHS favorites.  For anyone truly interested in some astounding live shows, check out IN THE ROUND, IN YOUR FACE for some great hard rocking entertainment.  The show featured is from the Hysteria tour and I was only ten at the time and couldn't see it live.  Now I see what I missed! From the phenomenal laser show to the twist on Bringin' on the Heartbreak to the showstopping Rock of Ages, this video captures the magic of a truly talented and entertaining band.  The showcase of their videos on HISTORIA really bring back that rock and roll vibe of the early and mid 80s--it's cool to have these videos since no one (AHEM---mtv!) seems to play videos anymore now or from that era. Plus, it gives you little quirky introductory notes on the making of each video. Put a little nostalgia in your life! BUY THIS!!",1011225600,2,897,4.451219512195122
1658346,5,B00005RZPK,"What a treat to discover that Def Leppard was releasing some of their best VHS tapes onto DVD. Although Def Leppard may have been slagged unfairly as a ""hair band"",  they truely had some of the most ear candy songs with a healthy sprinkling of melodic guitar solos from the eighties. I was lucky enough to see a couple of their live shows back then, and if you are a fan of over the top metal concert spectaculars, as there were back then, you will like the DVD (especially if you like lasers). As a fan of DVDs, I particularly enjoy the concert DVDs because of the fact you can virtually turn a room into a concert hall-DVD's are that good. My personal favorite, although all the tunes are great would be ""Bringing On The Heartbreak"" with the acoustic intro. As a last note, this performance includes the late,great Steve Clark, who along with Phil Collen created that wonderful twin ""wall of sound"" melodic guitar attack for the Leps. Steve, you are still greatly missed. Lep fans, I hope you enjoy this treat as much as I do whom miss great shows and music from alot of the crap that is out today..........",1010880000,61,1109,4.463054187192118
