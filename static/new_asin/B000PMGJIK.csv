8192533,5,B000PMGJIK,"My grandsons love BibleMan. I'm so grateful to have a quality, well done alternative to what's on TV to offer them. In fact, I learn a lot watching the DVD with my grandsons because the story uses the Word of God in practical life situations. They show the incredible power of the Word of God in such a way that children as well as adults have a new level of understanding and an appreciation for God's Word. I also love that they give my grandsons a strong role model of someone who knows how to powerfully and effectively use the Word of God as a sword. I so appreciate this. I highly recommend these DVDS.",1391731200,,608,4.2956521739130435
8192534,4,B000PMGJIK,"This edition of the Bibleman Adventure differs from the original cut in that the villain's ""gratuitous dance number"" is new.  The scene is all the same, but the soundtrack is different.  Also, there's newer background music for the fight scenes in the studio--it's a little more ""exciting"".  Other than that, there are no changes to the story.",1175644800,,343,4.982456140350878
