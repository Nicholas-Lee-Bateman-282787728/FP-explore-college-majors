1409958,5,B000059ZXX,To be recommended if the interest in film expands beyond standards and structures. A great film with Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave. Can watch it over and over again.,1363219200,3,168,4.827586206896552
1409959,4,B000059ZXX,"[A QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY - 1969 - Widescreen - English or Italian w/ English subtitles - Directed by Elio Petri] I was unaware of this film until it was finally released on dvd late in 2011 by MGM Limited Edition Collection DVD-R, and it was a treat to watch. I love hunting for obscure titles and finding  minor gems like this one, and who would've thought that renowned director Elio Petri ('The 10th Victim', 'Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion', 'Alfredo Alfredo') would've made a giallo in English? It's an Rome/Paris co-production AKA 'Un Tranquillo Posto Di Campagna'.

Franco Nero stars as a prominent painter who is currently plagued by nightmarish dreams that are both violent and sexually bizarre, involving his lover and press agent, Vanessa Redgrave, and she's convinced it would do him good to get away for a while. He chooses to rent a villa in the country as a means of escape, but instead of the stately places Redgrave shows him, he opts for a quiet, dilapidated place in dire need of repair. He won't let Redgrave talk him out of it, and immediately begins the necessary repairs when he's not working on his paintings.

Redgrave drags several art patrons out to see Nero and his new work, as the costs he's incurring are steep and he needs to sell some artwork in order to continue to support himself, and keep her well-commissioned too. Unfortunately, the nightmares don't cease; in fact, they take on added imagery in the form of a ghostly female presence from the past that has a history tied to the house he's renting. This becomes his new fixation, as he attempts to pry information from the locals about the woman, learning that everyone knew who she was, but no one is willing to divulge all the details from her past. His obsession now all-consuming, he spirals deeper into a compulsive abyss that threatens to consume him.

Redgrave's concerned that he's teetering on madness, and elects to have a sance with some locals and a few patrons to get to the bottom of things once and for all, and this act elicits more mysterious events that push all parties into places none would voluntarily go, and not all will return from intact.

Although Redgrave was the better known of the two, this is Nero's film from start to finish, and I've never seen him better, literally chewing up scenes of the film with captivating relish and panache. The chemistry between them is obvious, as they were living together at this time, and Redgrave slyly gets her moments chalked up as well. The ending is a great one I wouldn't dare divulge here, you need to check this out for yourself, and won't be sorry you did. Nero, Redgrave, Petri, 60's film and giallo fans will all benefit from this viewing experience.

The film transfer is a solid one although it hasn't been remastered, and though it's listed on Amazon and on the box cover that it's in Italian w/ optional English subs, it's actually available in English and, after watching it in both, realized that it was obviously filmed in English, so that's the preferential way to go. Either way, it's a highly enjoyable film that doesn't disappoint. After watching 'A Quiet Place in the Country', you'll welcome the noisy bustle of city life for a while. 4  stars.",1340496000,20,3239,4.701940035273369
1409960,5,B000059ZXX,"""A quite place in the country"", a pretty deceptive title (purposely so). This is a great movie by Elio Petri that uses surreal imagery, feelings, and thoughts to tell its story. In the case, it's an eccentric painter's journey into madness or joy (you be the judge).

Great international actor Franco Nero is at his best portraying a man with two halves one half is in reality, the other is in fantasy. Vanessa Redgrave who is magnificently beautiful in this movie is his mistress who at times also plays games on him and makes his ever inducing madness all the more big.

There's also a side story dealing with the supernatural, and a young girl who was killed.

This is very entertaining and intense film that doesn't pull any punches. Very much recommended.",1289260800,,760,4.6992481203007515
1409961,5,B000059ZXX,"This is a great, underrated, atmospheric, at times creepy, at times funny tale of an unstable, uncompromising, brilliant painter (Franco Nero) who is emotionally still in an adolescent boy phase. He is with a controlling, manipulative lover who is also his manager/agent (Vanessa Redgrave - these guys were a real life item at time - and got back w/ each other in early 90s and still together today). Director Petri (who also did THE 10TH VICTIM and INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION) balances the elements to create a really unique film that is part ghost story, part psycho-drama about someone losing their mind and part tragi-comedy/satire on gender roles, art [...], etc,. Highly recommended With one of my favorite (though atypical) Morricone scores.",1256256000,7,764,5.169354838709677
1409962,2,B000059ZXX,"A mad artist can't separate fantasy from reality and takes us on a 106 minute, sleep-inducing journey through his own illusions, which include a vision of a girl who died twenty years ago in an Italian villa. Cinematic chloroform from what should have been a fascinating film. Had the music not been so frightfully avant-garde, I might have enjoyed this a little more. I got the point that the music reflected his inner turmoil, but it was just a bit too noisy and chaotic for me. Also, his imitation of a three year old who can't keep the same train of though for more than five minutes de-railed my interest in the story. Vanessa Redgrave, especially, and the rest of the cast give fine performances, but the movie just didn't work for me. This film was a real disappointment and I kept thinking what Mario Bava could have done with material like this!",984096000,7,854,4.588235294117647
7934532,5,B000059ZXX,"Just watched it and am still totally blown away by this movie. Very modern and subtil in the way it is filmed. Not for everybody. Not a movie you watch like you watch a common movie, with popcorn and coke...This one demands attention, reflexion, and is definitely ""speaking"" about something, in a ""psycho-analytic"" way, mingling dreams, fantasies, and so many subjects like creation, art, sex, money, impotence etc.
Quite a complex object if you ask me.",1508630400,,453,4.973684210526316
7934533,4,B000059ZXX,Great cast and an exceptionally obscure score from Morricone.,1464998400,,61,5.888888888888889
7934534,2,B000059ZXX,"The description of this film sounds much better than the actual film itself. If you are a horror fan, this film is not for you.  It is artsy, artsy, artsy-- reflecting avante garde art films of the early 1970s. Many reviewers give this film 4-or-5-star reviews -- which I simply cannot fathom. As an historical artifact, it does represent its time. So, if you want to see an artsy, oblique, difficult-to-follow film of the early 1970s, with odd photography and unrealistic human interactions, this is a worthwhile investment of your time. But, as a horror film, or as a psychological drama depicting descent into madness (which is the basic story here), there are much better films out there. Essentially, this film is similar to ""The Shining"" (as another reviewer already commented), except we have a painter instead of a writer. And the isolation of the protagonist is not as profound.  But this film is only 1% as effective and entertaining/engaging as the Kubrick film. Kubrick's film is head and shoulders above this one. (And, Kubrick's film is not perfect, either.)

I found this film to be quite boring, and no ""horror"" was to be found. The ending is a bit baffling in that the audience really has no clue as to what is ""real"" and what is ""fantasy"". (Here is where that artsy experimental film-making comes in to the max). It reflects the experimentation going on at the time in the film industry. But, that is not enough of a reason to watch this film unless you are writing a thesis for film school.",1458864000,,1509,4.708333333333333

7934539,4,B000059ZXX,"A popular artist named Leonardo (Franco Nero) decides that he must escape city life in Milan, and moves to A QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. He and his lover / agent, Flavia (Vanessa Redgrave) locate a beautiful villa in the middle of nowhere. Leonardo moves in and gets to work on his paintings. Unfortunately, Leonardo discovers that a 17yo countess named Wanda died in the villa, and suspects that her ghost remains there. Becoming obsessed w/ Wanda, Leonardo sets out to learn all he can about the girl. What he uncovers only serves to drive him further into obsession. Meanwhile, a series of near-fatal ""accidents"" befall Flavia. Is Wanda trying to kill her? This all leads to a big seance toward the end, and the revelation of the full depths of Leonardo's insanity. AQPITC is a rather odd, deceptively creepy film. It's one of those late 60s ""art"" movies that can be quite disorienting. Best understood in the context of the period. Still, it's well worth a viewing...",1401753600,7,971,4.785714285714286
7934540,5,B000059ZXX,"I found this movie by coincidence on You Tube (for free) one evening when I was really bored, and I remembered reading a story long time ago about Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave both of which play key roles in this film (they were also lovers during late 1960's, and met 30 years later and rekindled their love in real life). But going back to the film itself, the movie was made in 1968, If I am not mistaking it was shot in Italy or maybe England.  The movie is about, a young painter experiencing his first, shall we say, artistic-block combined with bad dreams.  Franco Nero looks really cool in this film.  Before seeing this film, I only knew him from Django (1966) and his 1970's Italian crime films, but in this film he looks really hip even by today's hipster standards.  Vanessa Redgrave is sexy and classy.  There is real chemistry between the two (it probably has to do with their real life romance at the time)--Interestingly, Vanessa gave birth to Franco's baby boy in 1969 (their only child).  Overall, you have to be patient with this film,...the story unfolds layer by layer until we come to the shocking ending...and the viewer is left dumbfounded!!!

SPOILER ALERT________ The movie is very reminiscent of late Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980).",1389139200,7,1263,4.713636363636364
7934541,5,B000059ZXX,"Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero star in Elio Petri's ""A Quiet Place in the Country"" made at the height of their romance off-screen.  On-screen they are well-pitted although Nero basically has the edge on Redgrave normally superior acting prowess.  They prove to be have a durable chemistry together although they are seen as abusive to each other psychologically and competitive.  Produced by Alberto Grimaldi, Petri's film with screenplay by Petri and Luciano Vincenzoni is brilliantly conceived and done with everyone giving a first-rate performance.  Edited by Ruggero Mastroianni, cinematography by Luigi Kuveiller  and the score by Ennio Morricone are all equally brilliant as well as the art direction by Sergio Canevari.  The film's story is of an artist who goes to the country to work and resides at an estate inhabited by the disturbed ghost of a prior owner whom he proceeds to help solve her unrest.  Has a lot to say about our dependence on the advancements of technology on our society.  Beautifully done by MGM/UA Limited Editions in English or Italian with subtitles in color.
