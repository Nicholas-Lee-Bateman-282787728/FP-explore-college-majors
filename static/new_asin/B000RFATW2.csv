8200348,4,B000RFATW2,"This DVD explores the unique circumstances where trains run on rails embedded in city streets.  We're not talking about street cars or trolleys - these are full sized freight trains that, in rare circumstances, must run on rails that share the road with cars, pedestrians, bicyclists, etc...

The DVD does a great job of showing the trains rumbling through the middle of a town or city. It's really astounding looking to see these huge trains running through busy thoroughfares or residential neighborhoods. In some cases the train must obey traffic signals just like all other motorists.

The narrator explains what type of freight is being carried, or in a few cases which passenger trains it is. Trains operated by a wide variety of operators are shown, including some defunct lines like Conrail. The narrator also explains how often a particular train runs in the various towns visited.

It was a bit funny to observe how local residents react to the trains running on their streets. In almost every case they are almost oblivious to the train and don't pay it any attention. I guess they see it so often it's no longer unusual.

If you are a train buff I recommend this DVD because it is quite unique, although it does it a bit repetitive at times.  But the narrator keeps it interesting throughout the whole video.",1420761600,,1320,4.79295154185022
