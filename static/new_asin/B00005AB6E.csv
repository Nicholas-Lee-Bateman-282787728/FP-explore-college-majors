1413669,5,B00005AB6E,"I have been lucky enough to see Rankin many times, the latest being a few months ago.
This DVD is a live concert, pure Rankin.
Great backup band and the interview with him is superb as well.",1043193600,8,190,4.162162162162162
1413670,5,B00005AB6E,"I'm a big Kenny fan. Like other reviewers, I think he's vastly underrated (in the same vein as Michael Franks, Al Jarreau, Fran Sinatra). But Kenny's got a much better voice. He moves across octaves without the obvious breaks that mere mortals have.
This is clearly a good CD. But, like most live albums, this doesn't sound as good as it could. The issue is one of the superior recording quality of a studio.
So, for straight sound quality, pick up a studio CD (my favorites are the most recent jazz work -- Because of You, Professional Dreamer, and Here in My Heart. To appreciate what he can do live, this DVD or the ""Bottom Line Encore"" CD will get you eagerly waiting for him to make an appearance in your town (unlikely. For concert appearance check out kenny.rankin.com).",1020124800,4,777,4.597122302158273
1413671,5,B00005AB6E,"This is a must have DVD for all Kenny Rankin fans.  I find  myself somewhat envious of the people that were there for the performance.  This feeling is somewhat mollified by the fact that this is the best sounding DVD I've ever encountered, bar none.  The musicians, the cameramen and the sound engineers all did a superb job, and I recommend it to everyone.",1015891200,4,358,4.546875
1413672,5,B00005AB6E,"This DVD is a must have for any Kenny Rankin fan.  I find myself somewhat envious of the people that were actually there for the performance.  Also, this is the best sounding DVD I've ever encountered, bar none.  In all, a superb effort on the part of the musicians, the cameramen and the sound engineers.",1015891200,,305,4.509090909090909
1413673,5,B00005AB6E,"I am a music lover that owns over 2,000 albums/cds ranging from Sinatra to Bill Withers (2 of my all-time favorites) and everywhere between. I'm not into rap at all. Not big on country (though I think singer/songwriter Jimmy Webb is brilliant). I believe that Kenny Rankin is one of the most underappreciated vocalists of all time. His voice is awsome. I have had the pleasure of seeing him perform live about 6 times, mostly in the past 5 years. He was absolutely terrific! I find this recent dvd and cd very enjoyable. Buy it. Better yet, catch one of his live shows. You will LOVE him. I also suggest you visit his web site at kennyrankin.com. Once there you can view his guest book where you will read comments from thousands of fans that are nuts about him. Not too long ago Tony Bennett was having a tough time connecting with the huge base of fans that he now enjoys. I'm happy for him because I think he's great. I wish that Kenny might enjoy a resurgence in popularity similar to Mr. Bennett's because--Kenny Rankin is a rare and gifted artist!
Sincerely,
Chris Carson

1413674,5,B00005AB6E,"Each time I've seen Kenny Rankin at the Bottom Line in New York, I've come away amazed by this man's stunning voice. This DVD does not disappoint. His poignant interpretations continue to touch me year after year. I bought a DVD player, just for this performance - I'm glad I did!",1000339200,10,280,4.509803921568627
1413675,5,B00005AB6E,"I never was lucky to hear Kenny Rankin in concert. Now that he is gone, this is the best way to enjoy his music. BET put together a good sample of his most familiar songs. The production is simple and sweet. It really does make you feel like you are there, taking it in all his wonderful stylings. It is worth your purchase. I'd like to thank BET for producing this DVD. I am also hoping that they will release Bobby Caldwell's big band spectacular from Jazz Central.",1256515200,,467,4.318181818181818
1413676,5,B00005AB6E,"I ordered this DVD (as well as Kenny's ""Best"" CD) 2 wks. before he died, after ""remembering"" Kenny Rankin's music and recommending him to a (young) fellow musician who had never heard of him.  What a tragic coincidence that he died on June 7th, after being diagnosed with lung cancer only 3 wks. prior.  I loved the DVD, seeing such a ""young"" (actually middle-aged) and talented artist as Kenny was. What a shock it was hearing about his death on the NPR news the morning after.  The second time I viewed this DVD I cried throughout.  What a treasure we lost!  And what is even more tragic is the fact that so few people realize it.",1246752000,2,632,4.413793103448276
1413677,5,B00005AB6E,"We've loved Kenny Rankin for decades, but he doesn't tour as much as he used to and it's hard to get to see him live.  This DVD is the next best thing.  Lots of your favorites of his, good but not intrusive backup group and a well filmed presentation.  Something to watch over and over.",1236038400,,286,4.163636363636364
1413678,5,B00005AB6E,Loved this DVD.  I felt as though I was at a concert.  Would highly recommend.,1235952000,,78,4.133333333333334
1413679,5,B00005AB6E,"If you like Kenny Rankin, you'll love this performance. He is in fine form here, his amazing tenor as melodic as ever. His back up band is outstanding, but the great thing about Kenny is that he can put on just as good a show with just his guitar, or singing acapella, for that matter. The best thing about this DVD is the interview with Kenny, which gives a insight into his creativity and his personal battles, all of which have made him a great artist and a truly sensitive and good man.",1223769600,,490,4.279569892473118
1413680,4,B00005AB6E,"This is about as mellow and pleasant as you'll find in a nightclub ""act.""  Kenny has to be one of the more relaxed, down-home singers I've seen. He talks to you as if it's just you and he face to face, commenting briefly before each song.  He not only has a pleasing manner but a very pleasing, soft voice.

The songs are all mellow, with just Kenny, his guitar and a bass player here, a pianist there or soft drumming.  This is nice, light jazz when you want to chill.

It's nice....real nice.",1190160000,2,494,4.268817204301075
1413681,5,B00005AB6E,"Kenny Rankin is one of those truly identifible musicians.  Two notes and you know who he is.  A master of reinterpretation with a voice that is flexible with an extraordinary range.  One of the most melliflous voices I've ever heard.  He has this way of taking almost any song and making it a Kenny Rankin song.  Over the years he's only gotten better.

This DVD shows him with an outstanding small group and string section.  David Finck and Joe Beck are amazing on this recording on bass and guitar respectively.

Kenny is at home in both the jazz, pop or popular standard genres.  He has a unique vision. He takes a song like ""More Than You Know"" and does it in a way in a whole new way accentuating notes and phrases with subtlety.

This performance is fresh, vital and he does this music in a state of bliss, or so it comes across.  He also shows himself to be quite the guitar player.  Very good technique.

You can't go wrong getting this.  This DVD is what good concerts are about.  A good solid group, extraordinary vocalist in an intimate setting with songs coming to life in that unique Kenny Rankin way.

I also enjoyed the interview portion of this DVD, it was very well done.",1186358400,3,1188,4.430555555555555
1413682,5,B00005AB6E,Kenny's a favorite of mine and has been for years. I loved this dvd and felt he really showed himself...great music and really enjoyed seeing him perform. Try to catch him any chance we get. I regret that he is not as well known as some other musicians...love sharing his sound with others!,1181174400,,290,4.490566037735849
1413683,4,B00005AB6E,"I love Kenny Rankin's voice and the performance was excellent.  My only negative was a personal one.... I prefer him with only the guitar and not with a full band and strings behind him.  Also, it just wasn't long enough!!",1121731200,,222,4.525
1413684,4,B00005AB6E,"I've been following Kenny Rankin for 30 years waiting for him to hit the big time, commercially. Well, it probably will never happen. Not through any fault of this concert.  This is really good. The best I've ever heard (or seen) him.  Really shows off his vocal abilities. Filmed before a small audience, in a way it makes a more intimate setting. Like many of the jazz channel productions, sound guality is excellent (dts), ditto on video quality.  Camera work is not terribly exciting.  And I would have made just a few changes in song selection.  But minor quibbling here - this is an excellent concert.",1076198400,,607,4.688679245283019

7935264,5,B00005AB6E,I have loved this artist for decades. Sad at his passing. He was a moody soul but on stage he was very gifted....,1408492800,,113,3.9565217391304346
7935265,5,B00005AB6E,I have followed him since the 70's. This is a nice list of songs that shows his versatility . Sorry he is gone!,1400889600,,111,3.869565217391304
7935266,5,B00005AB6E,"Love Kenny Rankin a Master of what he dose Vocal/Guitar!! He is missed. From seeing him walk out on the Johnny Carson show when i was bout 15, just his guitar and a wearing football jersey cought my eye, sitting on a chair, and catching him in 1976 at the Roxy in Hollywood a few times inspiried me to this day as a guitar singer songwriter. I was fortunate to meet him 30 years later at a rehearsal, we talked, thanks to Marc Antoine another great guitarist for inviting me, he was preparing to go on tour with Kenny.",1393804800,,518,4.242424242424242
7935267,5,B00005AB6E,"I grew up with no exposure to jazz, but this recorded concert really reaches my heart.  I was introduced to Kenny Rankin by the financial man Alexander Green, who really knows his stuff about money and music!",1390089600,,208,4.621621621621622
7935268,5,B00005AB6E,"Oh this is just perfect.  Now I can sit in my living room and pretend I am seeing Kenny in person doing all the wonderful tunes he does on the CD, only this time I can see his face and expressions.  Perfect.",1364169600,,207,3.9047619047619047
7935269,5,B00005AB6E,"I saw one song from this show on YouTube and was so impressed I had to have it so I could watch the whole thing. Great band, arrangements, and Kenny is magical.",1358035200,,160,4.03125
7935270,5,B00005AB6E,"As a college professor, with a love of music of all kinds, and a proud owner of several Kenny Rankin discs - I hope to buy them all - I played a portion of this concert to one of my classes and then played his stunning, classic version of ""Blackbird"" to another class.  At this time, the Fall of 2009, I was not aware that Mr. Rankin, one of the best vocalists of the 20th (and 21st) Century had passed during the previous summer.  I just wanted to share his work to an intelligent, open-minded group of students in their late teens who had never heard of this man before.  They were both moved and impressed!  They sat still, though class was ending, as we watched  ad listened to ""Haven't We Met?"" in this very DVD - a MUST for anyone who is a Rankin fan if you never exeperienced him in concert, and even if you did - and I could tell they gladly would have stayed for more.  There is no one who sings like Kenny Rankin - one of his mentors, Laura Nyro, comes close, in her own beauty, passion and grace evident in Rankin's singing.  This DVD is from a Jazz Channel concert and, while by no means does it give you everything this man crafted with such care over the years, it certainly gives you the kind of modest, intimate concerts Mr. Rankin gave throughout the years, concerts that offered his great talent with the guitar (from the 1950's which he always used) and piano. And classics such as ""Peaceful"" and others.  I am so blessed to have seen him in December 2005, at Fairfield Theatre Co, CT, front row, where he played, sang, and offered amusing and tender insights to his life, career and family. He was a New Yorker, tough, but tender, and with a voice that Paul McCartney said delivered some of the best versions of the Beatles songs.  Please check out his live CD from the Bottom Line as well.  I write this with great honor - and incredible sadness - because I had hoped to see him perform again live soon.  I remember, at evening's end, in '05, there was Mr. Rankin, who had played for millions in his lifetime, sitting quietly alone at a table, offering his autograph and kind words to his audience.  His was a brilliant, beautiful, singular talent and this beautifully shot DVD does him every justice.  It is beyond ""5 stars"".  So was Mr. Rankin. So was the incredible, timeless music he created.",1262390400,4,2317,4.383177570093458
