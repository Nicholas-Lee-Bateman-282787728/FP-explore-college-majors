7994127,5,B00009XFKZ,"I purchased this manual directly from Dave Barrett's Harmonica Masterclass web site as part of his Level 1 package for beginners. That level includes three products that are part of a highly-integrated, logical, and very tightly constructed instructional approach--one of the best I have ever seen:

1. Basic Blues Harminica Method (book + CD)
2. Blues Harmonica Jam Tracks & Soloing Concepts #1 (book + CD)
3. Basic Blues Harmonica Method (DVD)

It's best that you get all three at once although Amazon sells the pieces of the package individually. In addition, anyone who is really serious should consider getting the Level II DVD titled Building Harmonica Technique Volumes 1& 2. This DVD is divided into two videos that average a bit more than an hour each. The first of these videos covers techniques like tongue blocking that are part of this manual but not the Level 1 DVD.

I started with the Level 1 DVD. This was an easy way to get into things. Then I started working with the techniques described in this book. In the middle of that, I backfilled with the material covered in the jam tracks manual and also checked out the Level 2DVD, part 1. This proved to be a fairly effective strategy.

This particular manual has 36 pages of explanations and exercises organized into eight sections:

1. Harmonica notation
2. Rhythm training
3. Holding the Harmonica
4. Embouchure (what you do with your lips)
5. Getting started (some basic exercises)
6. Second position*
7. Third position*
8. Tongue blocking*

* This is the core of the manual where the meaty work on blues techniques begins.

Don't expect to speedread this. When I say the manual is tightly constructed, I mean that just about every word and notation is important in some significant way even though you may not realize it immediately.  This manual requires serious, slow, and methodical study.

It will also be very difficult for someone to read this material and work out the exercises without further support. This is where the CD comes in, and the CD is a real your de force. It contains 48 tracks. Some of these tracks are Dave explaining things also in the text (which is actually very welcome). Most of the tracks, however, present the exercises. And when I started using the manual and the CD together, I found that Dave's instructional approach was a model in how to teach a complicated subject by breaking it down into manageable bits and walking the user step by step into a mastery of the blues harp.

The CD was a real godsend when I realized that I could set my player to repeat specific tracks covering exercises. After 10 repetitions, the light started to dawn as the exercises seeped down to my DNA level. This repetition made it much easier to practice playing. The CD is also something that you can simply play in the car or on a plane, making the learning an even more immersive experience.

There are no particular prerequisites for these lessons other than a serious interest in the harp. In this regard, though, I have a couple of points:

1. The manual's focus is on the Chicago style of blues harp. However, a solid foundation in this should serve well for other blues styles as well as for rock, folk, and country. A more synoptic look at a range of styles is in Harmonica For Dummies, which is written by someone who also teaches in the Harmonic Masterclass series of personal lessons.

2. Some rudimentary knowledge of music theory will be helpful. Or a working knowledge of guitar techniques.

3. If you don't already have a C major 10-holer, best to get one now. Suggestions: Hohner Special 20, Lee Oskar, Seydel Blues Soloist Pro, Suzuki Manji or Promaster. The last three are pricier. Avoid the Hohner Marine Band (wood comb + moisture = trouble) and Golden Melody (too curvy to start with).

4. I haven't finished working through Level 1 yet but expect it to take me a solid two to three months of work. Others might be faster, but speed isn't necessarily a good thing in this case. Expect to practice hard. Otherwise the work that has gone into this manual will be wasted.

5. If you don't already have CD's for the great bluesmen on the harp, best to start stocking up. Little Walter, James Cotton (my favorite), Paul Butterfield, Sonny Boy Wilkiamson I and II, etc. When you aren't practicing, you ought to be listening. Otherwise, you probably won't understand why you're practicing.

I highly recommend the Level 1 products. And by the way, Dave Barrett has recently opened up a Blues Harmonica instructional web site that uses a subscription pricing model ($17 per month). While I haven't tried this yet, serious users should probably take a look at that as another possibility.",1336694400,9,4685,4.735872235872236
7994128,3,B00009XFKZ,"The Basic Blues Harp instructional material on this dvd is very good and David Barrett is an excellent teacher but the image quality of the dvd is not at all as good as the other dvds of David's more advanced Harmonica Instruction: Mel Bay Building Harmonica Technique DVD Vol. 1 & 2 and Mel Bay Building Harmonica Technique DVD Vol. 3 & 4. I think this dvd lost a lot of image quality when it was transferred for the original source tape.
You'll be pleasantly surprised when you've learned this material and move on to the Building Harmonica Technique DVDs 1 & 2 and 3 & 4. The screen image quality on those two dvds is sharp and clear - as image quality should be with the dvd format.",1183507200,9,686,4.325581395348837
7994129,5,B00009XFKZ,"I can understand why another reviewer would be miffed that another book with another CD needs to be bought to complete this DVD seris; granted, it should have been lumped together as a package but then again, how many people want to shell out $50 for their first blues harp lesson?  Not too many!  As unfortunate as that marketing snafu is/was, it should not detract from the quality dvd that this presents for the beginning blues harp player.  I've suffered through at least three (3) CD Beginner Lessons by three different authors (including some notable names) and they couldn't teach me in two weeks of listening that this dvd didn't teach me in one hour of playing!  Nothing compares to having someone SHOW you how it's done - it's almost like having your own private instructor next to you demonstrating what to do and what not to do.  I started out by pursing my lips - yup, that's what LISTENING to CD instructions does - you can't really tell what they're trying to teach.  But within minutes of watching this dvd, I learned how to play the harp the right way.  The rest will be up to me and practice.  This DVD also got me buying the several other Mel Bay DVDs that go into more detail.  I also went and bought that pesky book and cd set that should have been bundled with this dvd in the first place (okay, deduct style points for that one).  The bottom line is that I would recommend this DVD over any other audio CD to anyone seriously contemplating getting started by playing it the right way and not having to unlearn a bunch of things you imagine should be done with any audio instructions.  Buy this product and similar Mel Bay DVDs - skip the CDs if you want to save a few bucks until you're sure you are serious about practicing.",1175472000,19,1748,4.43125
