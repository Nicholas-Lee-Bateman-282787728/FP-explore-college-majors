It was fun to see and get exposure to the incoming draft class.  For example, it was fun and enlightning to see Derrick Johnson making 'plays' all over the field.  Considering analysts knocked him due to his size and inability to take on blockers, in these collegiate highlights you can see how he makes plays and finds ways to make an impact on the field.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I agree to some degree with the other reviewer about the analysis.  The DVD focuses purely on the positives of the player, and unlike print media doesn't really focus to much on player limitations.  While this was fine with me, I could see a desire to also have that analysis provided.

Overall I enjoyed this DVD and have recommended this product to several friends.  I believe it is good value for the money.",1129075200,,965,4.316666666666666
8066996,1,B0009UVC7G,"This was one of the worst sport dvd's I have ever ran into.  This DVD basically shows the same clips over and over again to each 2005 draft pick the Chiefs picked up.  The music to the clips is even worse.  It looks like a rookie put this video together. I recommend not buying this as you could read more about the 2005 Chiefs draft picks than watching this video.  Overall, a waste of money and time watching these athlete's in their college career run the same highlight play over and over again.  You think they could find more footage and done their homework. Also the commentator repeats himself constantly on the video.  Boring.",1124409600,,635,4.526315789473684
