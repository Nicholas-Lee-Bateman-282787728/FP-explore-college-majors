8478162,4,B005LJJ6CS,"Aliens from outer space are hidding amongst the population of St. Tropez.  They can take the appearance of any human being, drink oil, and sound like empty oil can when struck.  It's up to Cruchot (Louis de Funes) and his wacky gendarmes to prove their existance.  This excursion into the realm of science-fiction became one of France's best money-maker when it was released.  Like their British counterparts, the French have once more proven they are masters in the art of making people laugh.  The special effects are not quite Hollywood-standard (the flying saucer has changed direction, yet its shadow keeps moving away); however, they are quite remarkable for a European production.  Sadly, this DVD is in French only, without English dubbing or subtitles, rendering it less pleasant to an audience that cannot understand French.  It is, nonetheless, a great production with some good visual gags that will make those who can understand it laugh from beginning to end.
