8580105,5,0965878139,"I usually don't write reviews, but I felt obligated to respond to a previous negative review of this video. Mr. Daniel's video has changed my life. I had trouble with my health for many years, especially with arthritic pain in my knees and lower back. A friend recommended his video, telling me how much it has helped restoring her vitality. I was skeptical at first, but after a month of practicing, I noticed that my pain was fading and I was moving easier. Several months later I am pain free.

Eventually, I read Mr. Daniel's book on Biotherapy, which further helped me improve my health. It is a wonderful book.

I am not a film expert, but I think the picture and sound are just fine, and I enjoy every moment of it. Thank you!",1139356800,2,733,4.4222222222222225
8580106,1,0965878139,"This is an inferior product. The production is poor. Dark and hard to see, Sound of poor quality or absent.  Boring instructions.  This item should not even be on the market.",1124064000,3,174,4.580645161290323
8580107,5,0965878139,"Energizing Tai Chi Chi Kung by Csongor Daniel is a purely delightful experience every time I watch it.
He has carefully chosen unique music to set a relaxed mood, to enhance the soothing result of doing Tai Chi.
He methodically describes and shows every movement to complete each exercise, so you will do it correctly.
The varied scenery is a wonderful tool to keep repeat use from becoming boring.  It is just a most pleasant experience to share your exercise time with this delightful young man.  You'll feel like you have gained a new friend with repeated use of his DVD on Tai Chi Chi Kung.
You'll gain new poise and confidence as you develop new coordination and balance from daily Tai Chi exercise.  Buy this DVD and enjoy!  Jane Lewis",1055548800,11,741,4.633587786259542
8580108,5,0965878139,"Csongor Daniel's self-directed debut DVD ""Energizing T'ai Chi Chi Kung"" is a great investment in yourself.  Even if you're unfamiliar with this ancient, up-and-coming meditative form of excercise like I was, you'll come away from watching this with the confidence that you can do it too, and that it really is beneficial to your body, mind and spirit in these modern, hectic times.  The backdrop to this artful, athletic demonstration flows seamlessly from the edge of the Grand Canyon and the beaches of south Florida to the green of Scotland and the stateliness of Yugoslavia.  It's almost like a travelogue for your eyes while you listen to great New Age music and Daniel's competent, soothing voice.  Then at the end you realize you got a workout in, too!  That's the best kind of educational exercise DVD ~ the kind you're not wishing would be over with the whole darn time.  I would recommend ""Energizing T'ai Chi Chi Kung"" to anyone.",1054857600,10,940,4.84375
