This ain't one of them.

The basics are two friends join various sex addict programs to pick up girls.  Eventually they meet one run by twin sisters and genuinely fall in love with them.  Hi jinks ensue.

It's a simple plot, but this film decides to throw in as much bad taste as they can.  Jokes involving masturbation, bestiality and beating up a crippled man fill every scene.  Even if you don't mind the bad taste, the jokes just aren't funny.  Imagine Porky's only without the nudity.

There's funnier films out there, there's better songs.  Skip this one.",1468281600,,720,4.461538461538462
