How can Benito Huipe not be in this documentary? The film ends very abruptly it seems, as if the film maker either ran out of ideas, film, or funds. In my opinion, it's not worth the $30.",1467417600,,342,4.359375

8342457,5,B001TX27EO,"Enjoyed this film.  The addition of John Williams (Guitarist) was very nice.  We see how guitar making has shaped this little town and the challenges they face from outside influences.  Whether it was hand or factory built guitars, one has a sense that guitar making is in their blood.  I would love to take a trip out there and purchase an instrument :)",1354147200,,354,4.571428571428571
