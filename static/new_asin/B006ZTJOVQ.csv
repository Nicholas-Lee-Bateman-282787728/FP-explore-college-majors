5043802,1,B006ZTJOVQ,"first they stopped releasing new dvds, cancel Turn A, over priced on Blu Ray for Single Episodes of Unicorn, now you can't get episode 4 on Blu Ray anymore on here, and now episode 5 is 128 bucks, seriously WTF Amazon",1336867200,6,217,4.317073170731708
5043803,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"ok so I LOVE AMAZON.com & I LOVE THE GUNDAM franchise; however everyone is correct $95 is highway robbery. So go to ""RightStuf.com"" the Anime~Manga devoted web site & you can buy Unicorn Vol #5 for only $47.99 ( + $8 shipping ). Sorry Amazon but overpriced is overpriced.
  As far as the Series itself, Unicorn continues with Man's struggle against his constant war of self destruction all the while striving for peace. The animation is beautiful & rich keeping the action fast enough to be action while slow enough to follow it. Twist & turns abound as we continue on with the story and for every secret they reveal another question takes it's place.",1336608000,34,651,4.6521739130434785
5043804,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"I really love the series, but I would never pay $96 for one episode 50min.  I'll just wait untill the price goes down.",1336089600,3,118,4.130434782608695
5043805,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"The whole Gundam Unicorn series is an AMAZING SERIES! I would recommend the series to anyone including new people to the Gundam Franchise. However, the biggest downfall here is sadly the price. The price of this episode alone is enough for anyone to do extensive research into not buying the product however, at this hopefully the price will drop over time.",1335398400,2,357,4.868852459016393
5043806,1,B006ZTJOVQ,"Episodes 1-4 I thought were pricey but they were also extremely wonderful gundam animes.  I am anxiously awaiting this episode but will probably be waiting for it to drop in price.  My borderline for paying for these episodes was 50 dollars so 100 dollars will just not be happening.  its not like these don't end up on youtube and xbox live.  I hate paying not owning the episode but I will do what works best.

That being said I am completely in love with the Unicorn Gundam series and even already have the banshee Master Grade kit.  Seriously hoping for a lower price as this episode just is expected to be amazing with two unicorn gundams.",1335312000,6,644,4.508620689655173
5043807,1,B006ZTJOVQ,"The series is absolutely fantastic, especially if your a Gundam fam. But this price is absurd. No way on God's green earth am i paying $100 for a 90 minute anime.",1335225600,3,162,4.258064516129032
5043808,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"The first four have been incredible, this looks to be no less. For Gundam fans this series turns the entire UC timeline on its ear. Having Banagher see things from both sides takes me back to Zeta when you finally got to see Amuro and Char fighting for the same side, Noa Bright is apparently some unknown super new type who doesn't age though. I won't hesitate to pay the price, this is the result of years on anime fans stealing anime online.",1335139200,,444,4.36144578313253
5043809,1,B006ZTJOVQ,"The only reason this got a 1 star was for the price. No way in h*** am I going to spend $115 dollars for this. I may be a die hard gundam fan but not that die hard. Bandai has gone out of their minds thinking they could sell this for that much. Is this the reason why they closed bandai entertainment. Sorry Amazon, its not your guys fault but I went and bought mine from rightstuf.com for nearly half the price.",1334361600,18,412,4.036585365853658

8507235,5,B006ZTJOVQ,I am a Gundam fanboy and I love how this series is put together.,1472515200,,64,3.642857142857143
8507236,3,B006ZTJOVQ,"Product arrived in about 3 weeks from Japan.  Movie is good.  However this purchased version, though it has the English dub on it, you can only play the English dub by forwarding to the end and then selecting English dub.  A bit inconvenient but besides that the movie was very good.",1437696000,,283,4.509803921568627
8507237,1,B006ZTJOVQ,So was expecting part 5 which I thought included 2 episodes like the others I ordered nd not just episode 5? But ehh to late ig.,1424736000,,128,3.9615384615384617
8507238,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"Now Unicorn OVA is outstanding aside from episode 4 which was incredibly botched when it came to story. But aside from that problem Episode 5 more than makes up for it. Everything returns to form and I am quite pleased with it, there is not as much Mech combat and I appreciate the nods to past characters and the other shows in the timeline. This episode's story sets up for the two episode finale coming up. One that has released and did a review for it as well. The themes of the show Family, focusing on the past, the now, or the future is present, Then we have the Zeon-Federation conflict heading to a close, and finally some hints that some of our favorite characters from the previous entry are probably dead. The animation and music are beautiful as are the character moments especially between Marida and Zimmerman... Riddhe continues his downward descent into being the douche in the series as he finally snaps.. Bright is still here and thank god for that..

My one gripe is that Full Frontal does not have any dialogue and they need to develop his character in a different way than just reminding us fans why Char Aznable was BA...

The other gripes are a returning character cameo.. They got the wrong VA to do him... Did not do the character justice.

Now since we are at the mercy of resellers since Bandai left North America. Rating the product a one star is not justified. If you like the product and want to support it do so. But do not trash the OVA for that.

Now I did hear a bit of news about the final episode coming in Spring 2014. It will be 90 minutes long. I think that is great. I will continue to support this great entry into the meta series and hope that Bandai returns to NA.",1378252800,,1708,4.378548895899054
8507239,5,B006ZTJOVQ,I'm a huge Unicorn fan. Getting this series made getting a Bluray player worth it. In fact its the reason I bought a blu ray player in the first place.,1367539200,,151,4.066666666666666
8507240,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"First off, the price from resellers is silly.  Since Bandai 'exited' North America, fans will be at the mercy of resellers.  Nothing really can be done about that.  On the plus side, Bluray A/1 means it will work in North America.  And seeing as how there are English subtitles and language tracks, maybe there is some hope they may return to North America.  So putting my best effort forward, I will disregard the price as I would have collected it anyways and will now move onto the content.

It may come as a shock, being a fan of Gundam, that I didn't really like some of the spinoff timelines.  Gundam fans that watched their first Gundam show on VHS will probably sympathize with me on this one.  I felt that SEED was good for what it is, but it didn't capture the nostalgia factor.  00 was well done and I respect it.  Then there are things like G and SD.  Between the high praise and not having to say more than the title names, there was OVA's like 8th MS Team.  They filled the nostalgic feeling but left me wanting more.

Unicorn is within the UC timelines.  One block checked for nostalgia!  It is a story worth telling.  One more blocked checked for content.  It is amazing to watch.  Check the block for video.  The sounds in 5.1 are clear and well produced in either English or Japanese.  Add an other check.  Unicorn is written for the current times and doesn't just rip off the original plot line by plot line.  Sweet, that makes 5 checks!

Volume 5 continues to see Banagher develop through interactions with Bright and Mineva.  Although hinted before in previous episodes, Riddhe continues to spiral down hill.  Past is revealed about Zinnerman and Marida.  And it seems like a good time to end and wait for the last 2 videos to be released.  So far, so good for the series as a whole.  I can hardly wait for the ride that the writers have setup.

Video quality is awesome, just like the volumes before 5.  Audio in 5.1 is pretty good, just like the previous.

End state?  You can call me an idiot for having to own the series given the resellers prices, but I am enjoying it a lot!  Recommended for anyone who liked to original or even other timelines.",1352160000,2,2172,4.417721518987341
8507241,5,B006ZTJOVQ,"II actually got this volume from amazon seller Japan store for a normal price and got it within 3 days. Factory sealed and bubble wrapped! 95 was ridiculous so i did some research and found a few sellers for average price. I actually got up late that day and rite stuff was sold out. As was amazon.com. great episode. 5 stars for japan store as well. Also, best price on gundam models and fastest shipping is at tatsuhobby.com",1342828800,,426,4.4743589743589745
8507242,1,B006ZTJOVQ,"Where do they get off for charging this much its an outrage, this is a great way to distroy a awesome new series.",1338163200,6,113,3.9565217391304346
8507243,2,B006ZTJOVQ,"I have been a fan of the Gundam series for a long time but would never pay this price for ONE episode even on Blu-ray. Complete series plus OVA plus movie maybe but NEVER a single episode. The previous episodes have been a bit pricey but they have been decent considering Blu-ray prices at the time of their release. I highly recommend the series and this show but would look elsewhere to purchase. Amazon has always been my first stop to purchase most anything anime but have found way better prices elsewhere (ebay,Rightstuf,anywhere else) for this series especially.",1337040000,5,569,4.816326530612245
