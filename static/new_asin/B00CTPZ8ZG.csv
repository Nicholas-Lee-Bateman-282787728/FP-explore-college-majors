If I'm not mistaken, the first time I heard both of these guys was when ""It Takes A New Man"" and ""Listen To The Rock"" (Baloon) were on the same WBCN album (or was it WCOZ?) circa 1980-ish.",1405036800,,319,4.316666666666666
8625042,5,B00CTPZ8ZG,"This is a must for rising musicians to hear the story of competition between rockers who have share the stage with greats like RUSH; Deaf Leopard and the likes. Through this strong presentation of the blood, sweat, and grit it took to live the dream it is easy to feel the energy and motivation to dream to be great in the music industry as guitarists, singers and musicians. Parents if this is the dream of your kid have them watch this movie!!! If you're fifty and young but have the classics loaded on Iphone down load the rental and check it out",1389225600,,549,4.392156862745098
8625043,5,B00CTPZ8ZG,"Watched my Farren Butcher - The Movie this weekend and I must say I really enjoyed it.

Having grown up in the Boston area I have seen both Charlie Farren's bands such as Balloon and Farrenheit as well as Jon Butcher's bands Johanna Wild and The Jon Butcher Axis many times.

As a guitar player with my own band V-Project, I have opened for the Jon Butcher Axis many times and was lucky enough to record demos with Jon's drummer, Derek Blevins. So, when I found out about this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it, but was not really sure what to expect. Producer Calvin Berry it appears did know what to expect, and has wrapped everything up into a nice package that looks and sounds great.

Farren Butcher - The Movie gives you some nice on-stage performance footage, and that is certainly a good thing, but for me, the behind the scenes interviews with these musicians was the real treat.

Both Jon Butcher and Charlie Farren and each of the bands they performed in were a big, big part of the Boston music scene in the 80's. Anybody who knows either one of these guys will be rewarded by hearing the path of their careers right from the horses mouth.  Entertaining, enlightening, and fun too.

For fans of Jon Butcher or Charlie Farren this movie is a must have.",1373068800,,1278,4.463519313304721
8625044,5,B00CTPZ8ZG,"What a great movie, being from that area I didn't know much about them, but after watching this movie I truly appreciate where they came from and how they got where they are. Such a fascinating story on both behalf's, I sat and watched it from beginning to end twice, focusing on the music (which is just awsome) and the trials and tribulations that a man of color playing rock had to go through and was able to relate being a woman of color that listens to rock<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farren-Butcher-The-Movie/dp/B00CTPZ8ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farren Butcher The Movie</a>..

8625045,5,B00CTPZ8ZG,"As soon as I started watching the movie I was captivated.  Seeing these two extremely talented, very intelligent rock musicians interact and swap stories was just fascinating.  Very rarely would you ever see two lead guitarists of their caliber sharing the spotlight like these two have done for this movie.  But, wow, do they make some incredible music.  They tell stories of knowing when they made it big with reverence and a continued sense of wonder at how it all happened.  At the same time they also talk about some of the low points and you understand that they did pay their dues.  If you have a teenager that has visions of growing up to be a rock musician, have them watch the movie.  There aren't lurid stories of sex, drugs and rock and roll, just two serious musicians with their own story to tell and you definitely want to listen.",1369180800,2,845,4.556291390728477
