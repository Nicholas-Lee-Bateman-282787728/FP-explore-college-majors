8576789,1,B00C2UN6QQ,"Movie would not play on my DVD player, did not see the notice that the movie would not play in USA, maybe my fault for not reading everything but it doesn't make sense to sell someone a movie that doesn't play in the country they live in. The movie had a foreign name under the title, maybe Russian. I am very disappointed that Amazon actually sold this movie, I just need to know if I can get a credit or can I return it.",1490486400,,422,4.035714285714286
