3509535,1,B001CDLAUI,"Dear god where do I begin?

This film had so much potential. Uschi Obermaier is a former fashion model, actress and one of the protagonists of the 1968 left-wing movement in Germany. She is considered an iconic sex symbol. She also wrote an autobiography of her wild life called Das Wilde Leben which was a best seller.

This film was *suppose* to be based on her book. Some parts are some aren't. For starters I think they did a terrible job picking the actress to play Uschi. The girl looks nothing like the real Uschi Obermaier. The real Uschi Obermaier was so gorgeous it hurt to look at her. To know what I mean, google her name and look under images. Natalia Avelon is pretty but she is all ""makeup pretty"". No natural beauty like Uschi Obermaier. Another thing is the badly done chronological order. ""Uschi"" looked exactly the same from 1968 all the way through 1983.

All in all, just rent this movie. If you're a guy you might like the film a lot since ""Uschi"" is naked 90% of the time she's on screen.

Also they left out the music video of Summer Wine starring Ville Valo and Natalia. Very very stupid thing to do seeing that was the best thing about the film. The song.",1232755200,15,1181,4.4036697247706424
3509536,1,B001CDLAUI,"It's a very boring film, boring and slow.  I know it should be an artsy, semi-documentary film, but please there should be some good moments in the movie and there are not.  DO NOT BUY, this should be a rental if nothing else.",1229990400,2,226,4.232558139534884

3509538,4,B001CDLAUI,"My girlfriend and I watched this without any knowledge of the story or the woman it's based on. We both liked it a lot and the lead actress (Natalia Avelon) does a great job at playing the naive German hippie/model/groupie, Uschi Obermaier. The movie starts in the 1960's and captures the social unrest and hedonism very well. Uschi reminds me of the American model Gia, without the drug issues and tragic ending. My girlfriend now has a HUGE crush on Natalia Avelon (who is naked during most of this film) and Eight Miles High has become one her new favorites! If you enjoy films like Boogie Night, The Baader Meinhof Complex, Gia or Almost Famous, you'll probably like Eight Miles High. The only drawback is that the smaller independent budget doesn't allow any Rolling Stones songs and the filmmakers don't show Uschi's life when she toured with the band (she dated Mick Jagger & Keith Richards).",1402531200,5,899,4.769230769230769
3509539,4,B001CDLAUI,The movie does a great job of evoking the crazy 60's and Natalia Avelon is absolutely hotter than hot as Uschi Obermaier.,1395964800,,121,4.545454545454546
3509540,2,B001CDLAUI,"Not to knock the whole film as I suppose it was good in its own way, but it held little fascination for me.",1382918400,,107,3.6956521739130435
3509541,4,B001CDLAUI,"Yes, she couldn't decide, she couldn't stop--you name it, the problem is she don't tell us reason but as she is good looking and most of the time naked--
everything goes. Supposedly she was involved in new revolutionary ideas but I didn't see anything new and neither she did after a while. Exotic locations compensated for lack of plot, everything was rolling smoothly, main lover conveniently died and that's the end of the story. Too bad I hoped for more.
For some reason I wanna add more. All action supposedly happens in West Germany but East Germany never mentioned once where words commune, communism etc were official. I wonder why. I also kept in mind their local community never ask how come they have free apartment, free water, free sewer and as we know everything cost money and labor.
Also strange was never mentioning any discussions or trivial thing such as shower, after  all nobody lives in vacuum. And this main chick--what was her reasons for fooling around, the movie mentioned word freedom  but my life experience and research tells me different story, like lousy men or lousy sex.
In short, like most movies this one is not connected to real life--its fiction.",1378684800,2,1183,4.822660098522167

3509544,5,B001CDLAUI,"Its a must see, and must have movie. And if you are very resourceful, she is a must have too!!! A very entertaining story, a very strong performance, and a very beautiful Natalia Avelon.",1275264000,,186,4.5
3509545,4,B001CDLAUI,"This film is great. It shows a young girl coming out of suburban milieu, and does what every young girl dreams about. She does it all, as supermodel, young revolutionary by default, and a lover to the most famous rock musician at the time. Remarkable, she did not follow money, even if she could had made a tone of it. She is living her dream and not dreaming about it. Again, this film is may not for everybody. It includes strong nudity and sexuality. But if you follow the story, the film is great.",1258502400,6,501,4.340425531914893
3509546,5,B001CDLAUI,this movie is one of the best ones i have seen last year - although it does not follow any standard criteria for arthouse or 'foreign'movies but  instead marches to his own drum -  weird and funny in the most honorable sense of the word.,1234310400,7,237,4.2444444444444445
8287075,2,B001CDLAUI,"2.3 stars. Not really worth the money. The people in it were sort of annoying and not particularly likable. For a story based on real life, it felt very 2 dimensional.",1486252800,,167,4.419354838709677

8287078,4,B001CDLAUI,A genuinely honest film in its portrayal of the spirit of the 60s and 70s. Uschi Obermaier remains a symbol of a life truly lived.,1463875200,,130,4.24
