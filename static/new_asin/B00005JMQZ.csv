1486056,5,B00005JMQZ,"Ok, normally I don't like to sway people's oppinions away from other reviews but I feel I must interject on behalf of Shrek 2 itself. First of all since when is a movie soley based on one thing!!!!!!!!!!!! We are talking about the WHOLE movie..... I personally, loved Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots; Mr. Banderas brought the swash-buckling Zorro act to ""Puss"" which I highly loved. He's now my NEXT favorite animal next to Donkey in this two part epic.... I'm not saying Puss was the entirety of this movie but he's a good reason I like it so much (yes I'm know, I contradicting myself). The movie all in all was superb with great music numbers, great new characters and wondeful old friends! There were laughs all around... And to qoute Donkey, ""It's another whirlwind adventure!"" Peace out!",1084924800,,795,4.685714285714286
1486057,4,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"" delivers just as many laughs as its predecessor but unlike ""Shrek,"" it lacks originality. ""Shrek"" won the first animated film award for the Oscars because in spite of borrowing and mimicking classic fairy tales, it still felt original because it incorporated them into their story instead of molding the story around these fairy tales. ""Shrek 2"" is a fabulous sequel because it works with what was successful in the first one. There is that same brand of humor and wit but because ""Shrek 2"" is a sequel, it does not feel as original as ""Shrek."" It may not be better than ""Shrek,"" which is forgivable, but ""Shrek 2"" will still deliver an enjoyable time at the theater.
Donkey is still the funniest character and the only success Eddie Murphy can find after his many flops. Donkey is extremely loud, annoying, and even proud of it as he says to Puss-in-Boots, ""The spot of annoying talking animals has already been taken,"" which makes him that much more endearing. Puss-in-Boots is funny in his own ways and has his moments, although they do not show enough of him. He could have easily stolen the spotlight from Donkey but somehow that annoying ass gets our attention. The other new character that is a good edition is Prince Charming. He's sophisticated, debonair, spoiled, and a mama's boy. Consider the scene in their carriage as the Fairy Godmother orders some fast food and Prince Charming orders a meal equivalent to a Happy Meal.
""Shrek 2"" contains more pop-culture references than ""Shrek"" and that hurts the movie a little bit because it means it is losing originality. I am not saying it is too much but it merely makes the film seem like it is solely depending on it for laughs. Nonetheless, there is no denying the amount of talent used to create this franchise starting with the animation team, the writers, and the casts. Even if it does not live up to the original, it still fares better than the rest. ""Shrek 2"" is one of those rarities where the sequel is not simply a recycle of the first one, but another chapter to an astounding fairy tale.

1486058,3,B00005JMQZ,"Certainly as funny as the original... I didn't wet my pants, but there were a couple lines worthy of knee slapping.  The flying goat character was hilarious!  The belligerent monkey was pretty funny too... I think he was my favorite.  I didn't particularly care for the racist donkey and his jokes about little people, but some people might find this kind of material funny.  The animation was very good but I wish it would've been in an anime theme.  Good soundtrack... I'm still tapping my toes to the Eddie Murphy's rendition of ""Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon"".",1084752000,,563,4.704081632653061

I am gonna' see it like 500 to the tenth power times!!  Please stay tuned for my reviews of Toy Story 4 and Star Wars part 4/(7)",1076803200,18,445,3.868131868131868
1486060,5,B00005JMQZ,"...lets expect the best! Although sequels usuallaly can't compete with the first movie, this one will!
In Shrek 2, Fiona and Shrek are going on their honeymoon to a place called ""Far, far away"" to meet Fiona's parents. On their way, and finally at their destination, the young couple and Donkey are experiencing new, exciting adventurs which will be in no way less funny than in part 1!
The same, great way of humor! More splendidly defined characters and even better graphics and visual effects! And of course we will get to know how the marriage of the two green monster will work out :) I will definitely be in the premiere in may, and I'm sure Shrek 2 will be by far more successful than ""Finding Nemo"".",1069027200,22,707,4.53125

1486271,1,B00005JMQZ,"*Contains Spoilers* (sorry.. it's been out for 10 years) I was very excited to learn that Dreamworls had signed Shrek and Donkey up for another adventure. What I didn't know was that it would involve so much drama... I won't go into detail, but it involves a lot of stupid and not a lot of funny. They even take jabs at Starbucks... I know, what would the world be without Starbucks, yum... Anyway, I hated it, and my believes don't align with two ogres ""falling"" in love. The sound track is a must listen though.

1486492,3,B00005JMQZ,"This is an ""okay"" movie. It has more crude juvenile humor verses the other movies.

My wife and I weren't comfortable allowing our younger child to watch it as it didn't seem to be a family safe movie. For example while not explicit it suggests oral sex in one scene. Things like that. We're okay with farting, burping and general silly kids humor.  We both thought ""we're becoming old prudes"" but I guess that's what happens when you have kids.

As a grown up movie we thought it wasn't as good as the other ones.  I suppose it is worth having if only to own the full series.",1457568000,,576,4.305555555555555

1488019,5,B00005JMQZ,"I recently got a great deal on a Sony KDL55HX729 for the bedroom, and I really have been enjoying the 3D experience.  I have enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2 immensely, I am not a great fan of Shrek The Third, but I do like Shrek Forever After.  Over the years I have viewed the first two installments of Shrek countless times in various formats, but the 3D Shrek 2 was like viewing the movie for the first time.
 I was a bit skeptical purchasing Shrek 2 because I was not convinced it was truly 3D.  My only regret is I did not purchase the entire series while they were at a reduced price. I watched Shrek 2 spellbound as the characters and the lush background just vividly came ALIVE.  I repeat, it was like viewing the movie for the first time.
Since I have assembled my 3D (television, 3D glasses, and that special cushion) entertainment system I have been purchasing numerous 3D blu-Ray movies. Shrek 2 is one of the best and is easily on par with Tangled. I am thrilled with the 3D quality of Shrek 2, and would definitely recommend adding this movie to your 3D collection.",1336780800,6,1073,4.371859296482412
1488020,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is an all-time favorite of mine.  The witty comedy hits the nail on the head.  And to top it off, it is (for the most part) appropriate for the whole family.  Dreamworks hit a home run with this one.",1335484800,,207,4.0
1488021,5,B00005JMQZ,"This is the best of all three of the Shrek movies, in my opinion, and in my toddler's opinion as well.  It has very funny parts and lots of great computer animation.  You will watch it over and over again.",1334361600,,205,4.1
1488022,2,B00005JMQZ,"I feel like I've eaten a bag of Doritos after watching Shrek 2. It makes you sick to your stomach and wishing you'd had a regular dinner instead. I watched this only to please a friend who assured me that ""the sequel is great entertainment.""

Nothing about this film is original. Eddie Murphy as the donkey is almost as annoying as Jar Jar Blinks in the Phantom Menace movies. The soundtrack is nothing but recycled, overplayed pop songs that I've heard on the radio for decades (i.e.,""Funkytown"", ""Ain't Stopping Us Now"", ""Hero""). The animation is decent but the storyline is as stale as a day-old Starbucks biscuit. We all know from the opening sequence that Shrek and Fiona will end up back together, no matter what happens. The only interesting character is Puss in Boots, thanks to the inflections of Antonio Bandaras (again, not original. That French literary character has been around in literature for 200 years).

There is something very depressing about how many people unquestioningly love this movie-sized piece of junk food.
Give them recycled music, recycled characters, a cute cat, and they'll stampede to the box office. On the surface, parts of the movie satirize mass consumerism - all the shop signs in the Kingdom are twisted re-creations of the ones you'd see in a local mall - but it's really subversive. It forces viewers to recognize brand names in order to get the joke -""Burger Prince - oh, I get it! It's Burger King!"" etc. A marketer's dream - promote mindless mall crap like Old Navy or Gap by making people think it's a game! Brillant!

In the same vein, endless references to transient pop culture (Justin Timberlake, American Idol, Mission Impossible) is played for laughs but also for brand recognition. Again, you have to recognize the brand to get the joke. It's a sign of American decline that people are so terrified of watching anything NEW, anything without a BRAND NAME, that filmmakers can get away with promoting processed junk like this.

Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I feel the character of Fiona practically promotes obesity. There's something about her tubbiness (more so than Shrek, who is big overall, like a football player) that makes me think the film is aimed toward young teletubbies munching Doritos and happy to have a stomach just like hers. Again, familiarity breeds dollars.

In 20 years, this film will be simply unwatchable because a younger generation of viewers won't have any cultural references to ""get the joke"" and by that time Starbucks and other stores of that ilk will be out of business. Fortunately, the classic, commerical-free Disney films from the 1930-60s will still be well-preserved enough to entertain them.",1332979200,,2686,4.946784922394679
1488120,5,B00005JMQZ,"True, the first Shrek movie stopped a six-year-old me in her tracks, but this film persuaded a nine-year-old me to watch it over and over - and a seventeen-year-old me to write this review. Like the first movie, we have Mike Myers is as the central ogre Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the loveable sidekick Donkey, and Cameron Diaz as the beautiful Princess Fiona. This film explores the question ""What happens after happily ever after?""
Shrek and Fiona are summoned to the kingdom of Far Far Away, where Fiona's parents rule, and they want to see their daughter and meet her husband. While the Queen (Julie Andrews) tries hard to accept that her daughter chose to marry an ogre, the King (John Cleese) is none too pleased, especially because they meant Fiona to marry Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who went to the tower to rescue Fiona, only to hear she was on her honeymoon.
Even worse, Prince Charming's mother, the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), insists that Charming and Fiona be together, which prompts Fiona's father to hire an assassin to kill Shrek. And this introduces one of the most popular characters of the film: Puss In Boots, played by Antonio Banderas. Although he initially attempts to do his job and kill Shrek, he is stopped by a hairball, and when Shrek doesn't take the advantage and kill him instead, he insists that he go with Shrek and Donkey on their new adventure until he has repaid the debt he claims he owes. Since then, Puss has become a favourite with fans and even got his own movie last year.
I'll leave the rest of the story for you to watch, but that's because I have to mention the music. It's all perfect, most particularly Puss and Donkey's ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" cover, although that may be because of the great movie shots as they sing.
Anyway, I think everyone will enjoy this movie, and it's the best out of the four ""Shrek"" movies.",1331683200,,1876,4.653614457831325

Now that the world is familiar, it's hard to keep that same 'lightning in a bottle' enchantment.  Still, way better than most sequels, and worth seeing if you enjoyed the original.

Since Shrek and Fiona were just married, they want to celebrate with them and enjoy their happiness together.  No one expected that Fiona married a big green ogre and her first kiss also turned her into a female version of Shrek.  They were very happy together alone, but the in-laws are struggling to accept what has happened.  Their marriage had upset her father's plans for her future and his.  Now the King enlists the help of the powerful Fairy Godmother and the handsome Prince Charming to change the marriage partner of Fiona.  Puss In Boots also figures in the scheme.

1488201,5,B00005JMQZ,"Woah, what a film! I couldn't help laughing aloud on several occasions while watching it yesterday. My favorite scene must've been the commercial for ""Knights"", a parody on the popular TV show ""Cops"".  Everything is brilliantly made. With voice actors like Carmen Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, plus SFX and GFX by Pixar, there is absolutely NOTHING to complain about on the audiovisual side. The script is well written, and when you deal with animated actors, there is not much that CAN be done wrong in the directing. The colors are just as beautiful as in Shrek 1 and follows the same color scheme, with a lot of green and red-pink-purple in shimmering, psychedelic, fairy-tale shades.  The humor is of course also brilliant. This ISN'T a movie for kids, the animators were adults making a movie to be enjoyed by other adults. Some of the humor won't be comprehended by your children, and if you're a conservative right-wing Christian, you might have some difficulty explaining to them why everyone else in the movie theater is laughing. But if you're liberal and want to take your kids to the movies or they're begging you because it was such a long time ago, then here is your obvious pick!",1253059200,,1217,4.79047619047619

1488204,5,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"" is a clever film with its share of adult humor and show biz inside stuff. Shrek and his new wife Fiona (now also an ogre) have been invited by her parents, the king and queen of Far Far Away for a celebratory get-together. When the royals see their new son-in-law and transformed daughter they are shocked. The bad king makes a deal with the evil Fairy Godmother to get rid of Shrek and turn the princess back into a beauty so she can marry Prince Charming. He's flitty, self-absorbed, and too charming for his own good.
The kingdom looks something like the Vegas strip with stretch coaches like stretch limos and a sign in the hills that is like the iconic Hollywood sign. Watch for the number of product placements in the film.
 Shrek is an ogre, but he is always proving how human his emotions and feelings are. Famous stars are the voices behind the animated or computer generated figures. Mike Myers is Shrek, Eddie Murphy is Donkey and Rupert Everett is Prince Charming. You can even hear the voices of Larry King and Joan Rivers. Shrek is turned into a handsome man, but he has more fun being an ogre.
 The film is fast-paced, just the right length with staged musical numbers, and satiric, tongue-in-cheek stuff. This one is better than the first one in the series. Kids may miss some of the humor. And they may not notice that the bartender is kind of different (you'll see). It's an entertaining m&eacute;lange with a rip-roaring storming of the castle.",1246320000,,1473,4.596958174904943
1488294,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is one hour and thirty-three minutes and was released on May 19, 2004. Shrek 2 picks up where Shrek left off. In the opening scene Prince Charming is on his way to rescue Princess Fiona. When he gets to the abandon castle the Big Bad Wolf tells him that Shrek and Fiona are on their honeymoon. When the two get back to the Swamp, Donkey is there to greet them. Also there to greet them is a royal messenger from Far Far Away. Fiona parents request that they come to Far Far Away so her father (King Harold) can give the two his royal blessing. Shrek is originally against the idea. In the end, Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey are off to Far Far Away. When the trio arrives at the castle of Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian (her parents) are shocked to see their daughter as an ogre and not to have married Prince Charming, but Shrek instead. Queen Lillian goes out of her way to greet the two. King Harold on the other hand wants nothing to do with Shrek. That night King Harold heads to the Poison Apple and hires an ogre killer. When King Harold comes back to the castle he tells Shrek that he is sorry and asks him to go on a hunt with him the next day as a kind of get together. Actually this is a plot to kill Shrek. The next day Shrek and Donkey are in the woods looking for the giant old oak tree. While looking for that tree they are attacked by Puss In Boots-the ogre killer. However, Puss In Boots fails in his duty and Shrek eventually spares the cat life. Puss In Boots is indebted to Shrek and promise to stand by him until he can repay his dept. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots head over to the Fairy Godmother house to get a potion to make Fiona love him. When Fairy Godmother tells Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after, Shrek decides to steal a potion. In the potion room he winds up stealing the potion Happily Ever After. Shrek and Donkey drink the potion and at first does nothing to them. The next day Donkey wakes up as a beautiful white stallion and Shrek a handsome human man. Also Fiona is turned back into her beautiful self. When Fairy Godmother learns of the theft and the potion that was stolen, she hatches a plan for her son (Prince Charming) to impersonate Shrek; since Fiona has not seen Shrek in his human form yet. Shrek arrives back at the castle to show Fiona his human form; instead Fairy Godmother traps him in a room and convinces him to do what is best for Fiona. Shrek looking out the window and seeing Fiona accepting Prince Charming (Fiona thinking Prince Charming is Shrek) reluctantly agrees and leave the castle. The trio is now at the Poison Apple drowning themselves in their tears when a stranger walks in the pub. Shrek seeing it to be King Harold seeks outside to find out what is going on. King Harold is there to ask the Fairy Godmother to call off the wedding. Fairy Godmother wants nothing to do with it and let him know that her son will marry the princess. When the trio hears that Prince Charming is the son of the Fairy Godmother the head off the tell Fiona the truth, but are instead capture and throw in a dungeon. The Big Bad Wolf, Gingy, Pinocchio, and the rest of the gang are watching this on the news and head out to rescue their friends. Once Donkey, Puss In Boots, and Shrek are free the gang head over the Muffin Man so they can bake him a giant ginger bread man named Mongo. The group head over to the castle and Mongo is able to get Shrek inside before he is killed. Shrek lowers the drawbridge and the gang head inside to stop the fateful kiss between Prince Charming and Princess Fiona. They group is partially successful in getting the magic wand away from the Fairy Godmother before her son is able to retrieve it and get it back to her. Fairy Godmother who is angry and is about to use her wand to kill Shrek, but King Harold who is wearing a armor breastplate, jumps in between Shrek and the wand and the magic bounces off the armor and hits the Fairy Godmother and killing her instantly. Fiona realizing the sacrifice that Shrek is willing to make decides not to kiss her true love a midnight and the both revert back to being ogres and Donkey is no longer a stallion. In a side note Mrs. Dragon gave birth to six mutated kids. I am giving Shrek 2 an AAAAA+++++.

1488295,4,B00005JMQZ,Very entertaining for my grand daughter. She loves Shrek and it is a great movie for small children. She has all three Shrek movies.,1230422400,,132,4.541666666666667
1488296,3,B00005JMQZ,"Unfortunately, this is where the series took a really negative turn for the worse. The writers seemed to not be aware of what made the previous film in this series work and concentrated on all the wrong aspects. Bluntly, they tried hard to make all the humor adult friendly isntead of kid-friendly, removing most of the juvenile and childish aspects which really made Shrek endearing to a lot of us.

The original Shrek is easily the best in the series and for a variety of reasons that are pretty clear to most of the viewers. Unfortunately, the things that we can see wrong with the subsequent adventures seem not to be so apparent to the people behind the magic curtain. They seemed to focus on the slight things that might've been problematic in the first film and then magnify them to the Nth degree for the following episodes trying to propel the franchise on its faults.

The best thing about Shrek was that even a two-year old could sit and watch the movie in rapt attention without drifting away. Shrek has enough light-hearted childishness to propel it along, forcing the viewer to smile repeatedly. The fart jokes work, the tongue-in-cheek anachronistic references make sense and give the film a sense of backward-nostalgic appeal.

Again, very unfortunately, nothing seems to work and everything seems to be a clich&eacute;. Trying to make light of celebrity allure and the Hollywood life, the film deviates too far from the original concept and comes up as a boring, overwrought piece of nonsense, bloated with 'actual celebrities' that seem either miscast or just tired. If you've seen the film then you know exactly who I'm speaking of, there's more than enough to choose from.

The original Shrek had a solid formula within the writing that never took itself too serious. It also seemed that they knew way back in 2001, that they were making a movie to compete with Pixar's 'Monster's, Inc', which was released around the same time. They also knew that they were targeting their audience somewhere between 3 and 13, but had hoped to make it appealing enough for adults.

Shrek 2 clearly seems to be geared and targeted towards an older crowd, probably early 20's. That would make sense, seeing that those in their early twenties are the most obsessed with Hollywood in these last few years. Someone must've forgot to target this film during the writing stage to their original audience. My two year old gets bored of this quickly, wanders away from viewing it and pays it no mind at all, unlike the original -- which he loves.",1224892800,,2542,4.794520547945205

1488362,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is different from the original in a few ways.  It has sacrificed it's cleverness for a more cute and joyfull mood.  The witty energy is more focused on the life of Shrek itself instead of the script and dialogue like the previous film.  Even though the formula has slightly changed, the movie still hits laughs as hard as the first film.

The new characters almost upstage the original ones.  Puss in Boots is the most adorable cgi character I have ever seen and heard. Antonio Banderas definately won me over as the film favorite.  John Cleese does an excellent job at playing the father, and the other characters do a great job as well.  And who would have thought that Pinnochio and the Gingerbread man would have some of the best lines in the movie?

The story, I feel, is richer and funner with a great blend of excitement that could entertain all of us.  At age 18, I can say that there is no target audience for these films, and I think they apply to all ages.  If you have seen Shrek and enjoyed it, then why not get seconds?  Shrek 2 is better if not as good as the original Shrek.",1205625600,,1098,4.307317073170732

1488364,5,B00005JMQZ,"Very worthy sequel, with enough to keep adults as well as children entertained.  Plenty of lampooning and satirizing, including a realistic Joan Rivers.  My only question is a needless plot hole: how did Pinocchio, the mice and the pig get from Shrek's swamp to Far, Far Away in just a few hours?",1196121600,,296,4.673076923076923

Her parents aren't the happiest that they're getting married, the Evil Witch of a ""Godmother"" tries to sabotage everything he stands for and even worse - tries to set Fiona up with the stunningly-gorgeous yet empty-souled blond prince which happens to be her son.

It's got its laughs but it won't have you rolling like the first did and certainly isn't as original and fresh-feeling.

I won't go out of my way to buy this and I'd rather not see it for another year or so!

1488368,2,B00005JMQZ,"Superb for adults, rotten for very small kids, if you can believe that.  I'll explain: For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI-type ""classics"" like Toy Story I & II, Bugs Life, Monsters Inc., Shrek I, etc).  Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent aggression, and usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these ""modern kids classics.""---rude comments, behavior and demands like ""WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!"" (courtesy of ""Bugs Life""); ""YOU'RE STUPID!""; ""YOU IDIOT"" (Toy Story); ""YOU STINK""; yelling ""I'm an ogre!"" after belching; ...and the like.  Even the brilliant (for adults, that is) Monsters, Inc., and these Shrek movies, have the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing, and being rude and contemptuous of each other.  Tots don't need to see characters being eaten alive by dragons, farting for entertainment, denigrating someone's bad breath, blowing-up mother birds with high-pitch singing so as to obtain the nest eggs for cooking, people being pilloried for being too short or different looking, etc. etc.
Maybe ""Finding Nemo"" is the least objectionable of the bunch.  In retrospect, all the CLASSIC Disney movies in our collection are safe, tame, and benign by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Snow White, etc).  I wish we'd stuck to safer products for toddlers, like the afore-mentioned Disney titles, or The Wiggles, Baby Einstein, Bob the Builder, etc.  I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting-edge, any day!  Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later from others? No one wants their kid to be the FIRST SOURCE of the poor habits and language being adopted by the other kids in the neighborhood and amongst the extended family.
The golden rule now in our house: If the adults enjoy it, and it's not tedious and boring, it's probably inappropriate for kids.",1193356800,,2092,5.2208955223880595

1488370,5,B00005JMQZ,"This movie was very hilarious. It had the same gags as the first one did, but with many more characters and with a much deeper plot.

This time, Shrek and Fiona are married. They get an announcement from ""mom and dad."" (That being FIONA's mom and dad) that compels them to journey to the land of ""Far Far Away...""

Donkey's back, as is Gingey and the whole crew. Here, we meet Puss, Fairy Godmother, Prince Charming and we get a glimpse into Fiona's true heart.... a glimpse that makes Shrek question his own existence. Honestly, this movie is very well done. The animation is sharp and bright. The motivation and the plot are both believable, even amid the backdrop of purest fantasy.

Who is Fiona's true love? It's no secret that, by the end of the movie, we learn that Shrek is just THA MAN! (Or is that THA OGRE?)

1488470,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek (Mike Myers) and his new bride Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are just settling down to their happy ever after when they get a summons.  Fiona's parents (Julie Andrews and John Cleese) want to meet their new son-in-law.  Shrek knows that their little secret will ruin the meeting.  After all, who wants an ogre for a son-in-law, even if your daughter is one, too?

Against his better judgment, the two set out accompanied by Donkey (Eddie Murphy).  When they reach Fiona's kingdom, Far Far Away, their reception is everything that Shrek feared it would be, which crushes Fiona.

Unbeknownst to them, danger is lurking in their future.  Fiona's Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) had a deal with Fiona's father.  Now the two will do whatever it takes to make that come true.

Can Shrek bring Fiona happiness?  Will the evil plot succeed?

The first movie was the surprise hit of 2001, so a sequel was only natural.  The first one was original, clever, and had a great message.  This one isn't as original and is a variation on the same theme, but it is funnier.  The jokes and cultural references are everywhere.  It may make the movie dated in 10 years, but for now, it is hilarious.

All the major voice talent is back and again do a great job of bringing their characters to life.  The new actors fit right in.  Technology has advanced in the three years between movies, and it makes for a better movie this time around.

The only flaw with the film is that, once again, some of the laughter comes from crude jokes and suggestive situations.  Since this movie aims at kids, that's a disappointment.  Watch it before you let your kids see it to determine if you think it is appropriate for them.

1488616,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek II is one of the funniest movies of all time. From kids to adults, there is plenty to enjoy.

Shrek, Donkey and new comer Puss In Boots are the stars.

It really takes watching it several times before you get all the jokes and areas where they poke fun at Americana in general.

One of my favorite scenes is when Pinochio and the others are back in Shrek's home and watching tv when an episode of Knights(paradoy of Cops) comes on. While they are watching Shrek, Donkey and Puss get arrested. When the officer pulls out a baggy and says it's catnip, the theatre erupted in laughter. My then six year old daughter looked up at me and asked why that was funny. No other kid was laughing.

It's just that sort of thing that you need to be on the lookout for. Jokes abound for the adults as well as the kids.

Puss has to be my favorite character. When he holds his hat and his eyes go all pitiful, that's when you need to watch out.

The extras are well done as well. The games are for the younger set, I got bored with them quickly. My kids liked them however. If you get the DVD you have to go to the Far Far Away Idol. With guest host Simon from American Idol, it gets pretty good. Make sue to vote the Ugly Stepsister the winner and see what Simon does.

One of my favorite scenes in the entire movie is the crazy, zany and welldone scene with the fairy God-mother, it is a total hoot and one of the best animated scenes ever. Michael Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy are all back to create the great voices of the main charachters. The animation is topnotch and the 3d is much better then the first movie.

1 - A faster-paced story; 2 - Better colors, just gorgeous with a 3-D effect in spots; 3 - another great combination of humor, adventure and romance; 4 - no one segment of the story overstayed its welcome; 5 - Eddie Murphy's character wasn't played up as much, meaning less abrasive shouting in this film; 6 - a genuine touching ending which left the viewer very satisfied.

Some of these qualities were all there in abundance in first Shrek, too, but the package was more complete here. It was softer, kindler, gentler Shrek film than the first. Murphy is a funny guy but his incessant talking can get on anyone's nerves, but with less to say, that didn't happen in this sequel.",1145577600,2,893,4.540372670807454

What a lost opportunity to teach a life lesson!  I must have been just waiting for Shrek to come along.  It is just such an exciting, joyous, wonderful, music-filled movie.  The music was epic.  There were a lot of great lessons here:  loyalty, values, courage, learning that handsome is as handsome does...

I also liked the message that a little honesty with each other, considering the other person's feelings, and being nice to each others' families helps even more than a magic potion.",1140393600,,409,4.746478873239437
1488673,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek was a great movie that still vividly lives in our hearts, minds, and on DVD (calling to us if Shrek 2 is a bomb). It was the film that made DreamWorks a major player in the animated film game, won the first Animated Feature Oscar, set fairy tales on their ears, and found a way to satisfy kids, parents, and those who think they are cooler than cool. Can Shrek 2 top the first one? You bet it can, thanks to the power of Banderas and Puss-In-Boots.

Mike Myers is back as the voice of Shrek - the not-so-jolly green Ogre enjoying a wonderful honeymoon with his new wife, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), after saving her in the original Shrek and having a fairy tale wedding. However, the happily-ever-after part of that fairy tale is being challenged.

Princess Fiona has been asked to come home by her mother and father, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of the land Far Far Away, so they can meet their new son-in-law. Mom and Dad think Fiona has married Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), but instead, they are shocked to learn she has married someone better described as Prince Surly.

Will Mom and Dad be able to accept Fiona's choice to marry an ogre and continue to live like one, even though she is a beautiful princess? Will Fiona want to stay with Shrek after his horrible behavior on the trip?

Shrek 2 is one of the few movies that made me laugh until I cry. It is an amazing film, and one of the funniest I have ever seen. Shrek 2 parodies Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, From Here to Eternity, Little Red Riding Hood and more all in the first three minutes! While the parodies and hilarious takes on our favorite movies and fairy tales are very funny, Shrek 2 succeeds because of great characters and a hilarious plot. It's as if writers J. David Stem, Joe Stillman and David Weiss, along with directors Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, want to give us what we expect up front, then deliver what we didn't realize we need in the rest of the movie.

With a sequel, new characters are extremely important. We know what to expect from Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey (Eddie Murphy). However, the writing team makes Shrek 2 an amazing movie by adding Prince Charming, The Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and, the character who steals the movie, Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas).

Banderas is awesome as Puss-In-Boots, a feline assassin that is part cat, a dash of Indiana Jones and whole lotta Zorro (I guess he would have been a whole lotta Hannibal Lecter if Anthony Hopkins played the role, that would have been creepy, eeew). Banderas knows exactly how to make the most out of his delicious dialogue by emphasizing the campy aspects, and the animation team obviously put the most work into this character to give him the best facial expressions and a dramatic flair that is rivaled by no animated character I can remember (he makes Jar Jar Binks look like a statue). As the movie goes on, Puss-In-Boots, with amazing dialogue and characterization, becomes a memorable part of the Shrek team and a character you will want to see again and again. Just thinking about his scenes as I write this review makes me break into laughter. Also, the writers have come up with a compelling story that doesn't feel like the last movie all over again.

Stem, Stillman and Weiss have created a great conflict for Shrek and the gang. Fiona's Dad is trying to get rid of Shrek, so our hero has to spend the movie getting back to Far Far Away, while facing peril and new challenges along the way, as well as his own fragile ego and self-image. It's an exceptional plot that never loses sight of Shrek's core theme of staying true to yourself and taking pride in yourself, no matter how you look (it also reinforces the important role friends play in our lives). Adamson, Asbury and Vernon amazingly keep this whole complex mixture of story, fairy tale gone askew, parodies and new characters together in a compelling way that always feels in control, builds to a great climax, touches our heart when it needs to, and constantly makes us laugh. They even lay off the gross out humor, most of the time.

Her parents wanted her to marry Prince Charming and her father hires an assassin to kill Shrek so the marriage can take place.

Shrek begins to think that Fiona would be happier married to a ""normal"" man and is willing to sacrifice everything in order to make her happy.

I thought this movie was even funnier than the first one. The addition of Puss in Boots is the main reason why I liked it so much. Antonio Banderas is perfect as the voice of Puss and the animators do a great job with the character. My favorite part of the animation is when Puss makes the sweet innocent look that cats do right before they attack. There are a ton of movie references in Shrek 2, so many, in fact, that I know I missed some. The ""Mission Impossible"" spoof was hilarious and the movie is worth watching for that scene alone.

Many things make this movie incredible:

Mike Myers, Eddie Murphey, Cameron Diaz, Antonia Banderas, a love story, ogres frolicking around, a fairy tale ending, and the prince does not get the girl.  And not to mention the beautiful animation, I really like the scene where Pinnochio, the three blind mice, grandma wolf and piglets, and Gingy rescues Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots from the dungeon.

For others with a more innocently enquiring sort of mindset, there is this contrary view of the Shrek spectacle whereby good culture is fed in and only burnt excrement remains wherever Shrek has struk [sic].

The first Shrek was thin on story, high on whine and bray factor, but this one goes all-out to alienate anyone with a residual love of cinema, and drive - or beat - said out of him or her.  The storyline is contrived at best, cynically sculpted from foam-injected Splenda with Nutra-Sweet topping as any Dreamworks poison pill ever was, and there have been quite a few to date.  The fairy tales on which it treads were works of high culture, to comparison of which the writing crimes of war that bloat this beast do not even bother to aspire.

The worst part about Shrek and its thuggish successor, Shrek 2 is that it fails to recognize the cultural value of children's bedtime stories as anything more charming or possibly sacrosanct than some FoxNews gargling of the Bill Clinton's impeachment scandal. The Shrek Franchise does all of the above only negative service, and finally shows no mercy for the unsuspecting viewer before depleting the well from which it draws like Coca-Cola ""borrowing"" and returning only polluted groundwater from the villagers of India who then die of cancer as a result.  Any time one spends with the Shreks instead of, say, doing the dishes, is destined to make the viewer a more hateful person, without him or her quite realizing why.  And that's apparently okey-dokey with everyone who took money instead of a decent rest from churning out garbage to make this.

But then, just as the end of everyone's suffering seems nigh as the story runs quite out (of whatever hot air was mustered to propel it closer to hell and the bereavement of the viewer's pocketbook) and almost grinds to a welcome halt, this ... thing degenerates even further into a mindless, seemingly endless 3-D avatar karaoke session, desecrating numerous less-well-known ""hip"" works of popular music, attempting to float itself to safety at the expense of the original music composers.  It really, really hurts the viewer.  And it doesn't even say it's sorry.

Ever wonder what made the Kinks' Ray Davies run after that guy with the gun who stole his girlfriend's purse, when he could've died ?  Now you know.

If you spend any money on Shrek ""n"", you will be.  Sooner or later, seriously, you will.

As far as box office receipts go, SHREK 2 succeeds, but lest we forget how much money Godzilla made back in 1998. The plain and simple fact is that Shrek 2 is NOT FUNNY. Pleasing to undiscriminating kids who lap this filth up, but disgusting and plain mind-numbing to more discerning viewers. I absolutely agree with Chad B. Rudolph's review, this is immoral tripe and furthermore, I don't want any more DREAMWORKS cartoons. I'm concerned that Steven Spielberg is affiliated with this second-rate bunk. SEQUELS ARE NEVER BETTER THAN THE FIRST MOVIE (Apparently). That's what they tell us, yet there are some that re-capture the essence of the first and infuse it with something new- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, TERMINATOR 2 and X-MEN 2 have proven that the impossible can be done. The animation has gone light years from the first experimental film, with some photo-realistic vistas and backgrounds, and the story is tighter this time around, but I was expecting something of a rapid fire laugh-fest when I got a few good laughs and not much else. I mean, fart gags? Give me a break! I hate that type of rubbish! IT IS NOT FUNNY! This is possibly the WORST comedy of all time, I can't say anything good about the humor really, it's such a lazy joke per minute ratio, and also, there's a fine line to tread between `homage' and plain rip-off. I want to poke Andrew Adamson in the eye. Shark Tale and Madagascar are stupid movies as well. While watching Shrek 2, I only counted 5 quality jokes, mainly puss-in-boots jokes, but they had been played to death on the over-hyped trailers anyway. The movie is so obsessed with showing that Shrek will do anything to make Fiona happy, the writers forgot what made the first movie work. I don't care how great the animation is, Lion King is traditional 2-D animation and that works better than this.

As usual, the movie scores greatly with kids and adults alike. I just felt like it was a little more predictable than the first (and that was more predictable than this one!).  The only surprise I got was the ending.  They decided on being who they originally were...ogres.

1489011,1,B00005JMQZ,"Though funny, Shrek 2 is unfit for Christians, kids and anyone concerned with Biblical ethics.

I enjoyed Shrek 1 and expected nothing worse from Shrek 2. So I let the kids watch it without previewing first -- big mistake! They asked about the man in the dress. Pinocchio and the ugly step sister (deep voiced male barmaid in evening dress) are crossdressers.

How is it deceitful? People expect the DVD to be the same or close to the theater version. Well, the DVD has a ""surprise ending"". So while prince charming is singing ""I shake my little tooshie on the catwalk..."", the homosexual cross-dresser is making catcalls and then pounces on him with a loud male on pseudo-male kiss.

It's amazing how many Christians approve of this movie. Are we that desensitized to evil. My cousin who works at Blockbuster said he liked it. I asked him which part he liked better, the cross-dressing or the homosexual kiss. Backpedaling he said, ""Well not those parts.""

A discerning reviewer from ""Christian Spotlight on the Movies"" concures: ""Shrek 2 was not a good movie. There were scenes that were immoral and disgusting. Like how the puppet was wearing women's thongs, and how he did the Michael Jackson dance by touching his private. There was a scene where there were these 3 women who want to rub Shrek's body all over just because he changed from ogre to man. Also there was a man who was in women's clothes, which is forbidden in the Bible to do. And in the end of the story, the guy who was a cross-dresser was kissing with Prince Charming. There were many other scenes that were immoral too. Those of you who are Christian parents, I suggest and recommend you do not see this movie, neither your kids!""

Another very funny  movie about a very good hearted Ogre!

Sequel Review:

Sequels are always very tough to create because viewers expects more of the same ""originality"" that they enjoyed in the first movie, but they also need some novel situations as well.

Shrek 2 does very well with this, but is not quite as fresh and original as Shrek was.  But, it really is a very good sequel.

Review:

Great story with a good script with good cohesion (but, a little choppier than Shrek I), flow and development; great caste with wonderful voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas as Puss and Boots - like Zorro; John Cleese as King Harold, and Julie Andrews as Queen Lillian), great animation, design and implementation, great direction and great movie.  Great DVD features that are extensive and  generous!

Good duel meaning humor that gets a little aggressive, but not too much over the edge (In one twisted humor scene, Pinocchio declares he isn't wearing women's underwear in order to tell a lie..... !)  This may require some judgement for young kids to watch depending on your children and their needs.

Storyline

The movie starts on the honeymoon of our charming ogre (Myers) and feisty Princess Fiona (Diaz) and friendly, but obnoxious Donkey (Murphy) travel to meet the Princess' parents King Harold (Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Andrews).

Of course, misunderstood Shrek is not approved of and the King (John Cleese) undermines Shrek to help Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) steal Fiona from Shrek with some underhanded help from Puss 'n Boots (Banderas), Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and Queen Lillian.",1116806400,,1650,5.059259259259259
1489015,4,B00005JMQZ,"After ""Shrek"" had me in stitches, I half looked forward to and half dreaded the sequel. After all, many a good film has been marred by an attempt to repeat the glory of the original. And many a sequel to a simply OK film just beat a dead horse (I can think of two examples starring Mike Myers). So I waited a bit before seeing ""Shrek 2"".

The second film is every bit as good as the first. Perhaps a little better.

While Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz all do a good job reprising their roles as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona respectively, it's the ensemble cast backing them up that really makes ""Shrek 2"" shine. Most specifically, Jennifer Saunder as the Fairy Godmother and, of course, Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots.

""Shrek 2"" continues the theme of a fairy tale world gone horribly awry, where the images of those characters we all held dear as children are dragged through the mud, much to our amusement and delight. As with the first film, there are many short spoofs of blockbuster films, including Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Mission Impossible and Alien, which are fun to pick out and manage to not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.

The plot itself is simple, but amusing, and appears as if the writers took their time to get things right, rather than simply crank out a formulaic follow-up, hoping for laughs in all the same places.

""Shrek 2"" is well worth the watch, whether or not you've seen the first movie.",1116806400,,1437,4.5115384615384615
1489016,4,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek"" burst on the scene with a hilarious combination of wit, visual artistry, and astounding voice-over talent (Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, and John Lithgow are all hilarious).  Grossing something like $5 trillion between ticket sales and a juggernaut of marketing tie-ins, you just knew that ""Shrek 2"" was on the horizon -- and you had high hopes.

Now that ""Shrek 2"" is here, one can say that expectations were easily met, but not exceeded.  ""Shrek 2"" still retains its irreverence, particularly for all things Disney, and is a visual delight as well as stocked with voice-over talent.  But the whole enterprise feels like not quite enough jam spread over too much toast.

""Shrek"" had a surprisingly tight (and traditional) storyline.  Shrek the Ogre goes on a quest to regain sole possession of his beloved swamp, and finds true love.  ""Shrek 2"" has a more complicated storyline.  Shrek and Fiona have their happy honeymoon period brought to an early close when Fiona is summoned to her homeland (the kingdom of Far Far Away) to have Shrek meet the parents.  But several characters have their own reasons for breaking up their wedded bliss, and when all these new characters are introduced into the mix, along with virtually all the beloved characters from ""Shrek,"" (only Donkey's girlfriend Dragon seems to be missing -- even the Three Blind Mice and Pinnochio get prominent roles) there is a lot more material to cram into the relatively short running time.  There's a resulting sense that we are somewhat skimming the surface with this movie, and it generates a lot less of the emotion that can be found in ""Shrek.""  We also don't get to know some of the characters as well as we would like (Rupert Everett's smarmy Prince Charming is one lost opportunity).

As with many sequels, a little more discipline with the plot and a willingness to let go of the first movie would have helped ""Shrek 2.""  But the filmmakers have probably made another billion or two off this movie as is, so what do I know?

Fortunately, the movie is as funny as the original.  The kingdom of Far Far Away is a fantastic surrogate for L.A., and there are a lot of comic gems nestled in these scenes (special laughs for the medieval version of pepper spray used by local cops).

Still, ""Shrek 2"" is a hilarious family movie to be enjoyed with the older kiddies (some of the humor may be a bit advanced for the wee ones, but they'll probably love it anyway).  Look for great comic performances by Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots, Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother, and the aforementioned Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, in addition to your favorites from the first movie.

The DVD also contains some fun extras, most notably ""Far Far Away Idol,"" a surprisingly entertaining extra where Simon Cowell, Shrek and Fiona judge various characters in a singing competition -- and you get to vote on the winner!  A worthy entry into the film library.",1116806400,,2935,4.776237623762376
1489017,5,B00005JMQZ,"More lavish animation, more unforgettable characters, more great songs, more sharply intelligent wit and comedy - all that and more goes into this sequel to the wildly successful Shrek.  The look and feel of this film really are incredible and amazingly realistic, especially in terms of all the human characters.  Unlike most films built upon a unique, breathtaking visual style, though, Shrek 2 relies upon a strong and compelling plot for its greatest success.  Even though the first film introduced us to Shrek-oriented parodies of fairy tales, motion pictures, music, and pop culture in general, the script still works its magic by consistently surprising and delighting the audience.  It's a worthy successor to a blockbuster of a film - although I still liked the first film better.  Aye, I laughed pretty much from beginning to end during Shrek 2, but the film lacked some of the truly gut-busting comic antics of the original.

Do I really need to rehash the plot here?  Shrek's and Fiona's newfound happiness together is put to the test when Shrek's royal in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, invite their daughter and her new husband home for a marriage celebration.  The folks expect Prince Charming, of course, and are less than prepared for the ogre factor.  Prince Charming is none too happy, either, and his mother the glamorous Fairy Godmother (you just can't trust a fairy godmother anymore these days) sets out to right the wrong caused by Shrek's unexpected rescue of Fiona.  The king is a willing accomplice, even going so far as to contract a hit on Shrek with the renowned feline assassin Puss in Boots.  In order to keep Fiona, Shrek makes the ultimate sacrifice, turning himself into a handsome man, but the Fairy Godmother thwarts him at every turn.  Even with the help of his friends from back home in the swamp, it looks like the honeymoon - and marriage itself - is over.

Everyone seems to be wild about Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots, and he does make a great addition to the Shrek universe.  The heart of Shrek, however, still remains in the able voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy.  It's pretty simple, really - if you enjoyed Shrek, you will certainly enjoy Shrek 2.  The extras on the DVD add even more delight to the Shrek 2 experience.  The Far Far Away Idol contest is a brilliant addition.  You get not one but two filmmaker commentaries (but, sadly, no commentaries with any of the actors), and several looks at the making of the film are also worthy of your time.  The rest of the special features are a little less impressive than they look, however - several of them basically just take you to selected scenes from the film itself.  Still, there's plenty here to occupy your time and magnify the entertainment value of an ingenious film all but guaranteeing a good time for one and all.",1116720000,,2858,4.735353535353536

Shrek 2 went beyond crude. Were my eyes playing tricks on me or was Pinochio in a pink G string? Was there a transvestite bartender?  Was the cat licking himself provacatively?  Not to mention a slue of other shockers that were completely unsuitable for a young audience.

1489097,5,B00005JMQZ,"As with the first ""Shrek"" film in 2001, DreamWorks did another wonderful job of animation and writing for the 2004 sequel ""Shrek 2"".  Beginning where the first film ended, Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and his new wife Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) have a wonderful honeymoon.  They return to Shrek's home in the swamp, which has been looked after by their often-annoying friend Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy).  Having learned about Fiona's marriage, her parents the King (voice of John Cleese) and Queen (voice of Julie Andrews) invite Fiona and her new husband to visit.  Begrudgingly, Shrek agrees and the three of them head off to the Kingdom of Far Far Away.  However, upon arriving, the King is not particularly thrilled to see that Fiona has married an ogre, nor is Fiona's Fairy Godmother (voice of Jennifer Saunders) who (with the King) had been planning for Fiona to marry her son, Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett) all along.  From that point onward, the Fairy Godmother forces the King to help her magically conspire to change Fiona's heart.

With superb animation, engaging characters and a wonderful story, ""Shrek 2"" is indeed a very wonderful film and I rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  The received two Oscar nominations for Best Animated Film and Best Original Song, but each of these Oscars were won instead by ""The Incredibles (2004) and ""Diarios de motocicleta"" (2004) respectively.  Overall, this a wonderful film that anyone of any age will more than likely enjoy.  Other actors who contributed their voices to the film include Antonio Banderas as a swashbuckling cat, Cody Cameron as Pinocchio & the three pigs, Conrad Vernon and Mark Moseley.",1114905600,2,1693,4.929577464788732
1489098,4,B00005JMQZ,"I had high hopes that ""Shrek 2"" would equal if not surpass the originality of the first film. I always have such hopes whenever tuning in to a sequel of a film I enjoyed immensely. No one goes into a sequel hoping it will fail, at least I don't. But we all know that movie sequels far too often fall prey to the dreaded law of diminishing returns. No matter what genre, no matter the size of the talent, no matter who sits behind the camera--we all realize that most sequels just can't capitalize on the success of the first film. There are exceptions, of course, but they exist only to prove the rule. I'm not saying that ""Shrek 2"" is a bad film. Far from it. It's quite good in its own way, full of funny jokes, double entendres, interesting characters, and great CGI animation. The problem is ""Shrek 2"" seems a little shrill. It's as though the filmmakers discovered what people liked about the first movie and then ran those themes into the ground here. They wouldn't be the first filmmakers to do something idiotic like that. If Hollywood is good at one thing, it's coming up with a fresh idea and then promptly sucking the life right out of it.

""Shrek 2"" begins by showing us the titular ogre and his lovely green bride Fiona living it up in the swamp. Alas, a new problem soon rears its ugly head in the form of a trip Fiona and Shrek must take to see her royal parents. Yikes. While her parents knew all about their daughter's particular curse, they have yet to learn exactly where she ended up. Needless to say, they aren't happy at all to see her strolling into the castle arm in arm with Shrek. As if problems with the 'rents isn't enough, Shrek and Fiona have to contend with Prince Charming and his driven mother, the Fairy Godmother. Charming was on his way to the castle to rescue Fiona when Shrek barged onto the scene, and he isn't happy about losing his bride to be and his entre into high society. His mother isn't happy, either, because her magic installed Fiona's father as monarch. They had an agreement, you could say, and now that this agreement is in jeopardy the Fairy Godmother calls in her debts. The union of Shrek and Fiona is in grave jeopardy until a few friends old and new arrive on the scene to stave off impending disaster.

Our favorite characters from the first film--Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), and Shrek (Mike Myers)--reappear here in fine, wisecracking form. Donkey still obsesses over becoming a steed, Shrek still has his bad habits, and Fiona continues to dream of romance. On this outing, however, a few new characters jump into the fray to liven things up. The most important addition is Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), a greatly feared feline assassin who accepts a contract to rub Shrek out but who eventually joins our heroes in their battle against the Fairy Godmother. He's a great character, a cat capable of wielding a sword to great effect while at the same disarming his opponents by looking cute as only cats can. The rest of the cast holds down the fort quite well, with saucy Brit Jennifer Saunders voicing the malevolent Fairy Godmother, Rupert Everett as the narcissistic Prince Charming, John Cleese hamming it up as Fiona's dad, and none other than Julie Andrews as the understanding Queen. They even got talk show hack Larry King to throw out a few lines as an ugly stepsister and Joan Rivers to play, predictably, Joan Rivers. Wow!

One of the great things about the first ""Shrek"" film, at least in my eyes, was how the movie blended contemporary culture with traditional fairytale fodder. We got music by Smashmouth and pop culture references mixed in with a theme about the importance of acknowledging inner beauty. Unfortunately, ""Shrek 2"" doesn't offer us anything new. The theme here is still inner beauty and its importance as Shrek decides to take some steps that could fundamentally change his relationship with Fiona. Didn't he learn the lesson in the first film? Apparently not. Perhaps sensing that they were covering the same old ground, the filmmakers went over the top with the references and jokes. While most of them are clever and funny--I loved the riff on ""Ghostbusters"" towards the end of the film--the jokes start to grate by the time the movie grinds to a halt. Even worse, they threw in a few musical numbers that I didn't care for that much. I'm probably making ""Shrek 2"" sound worse than it is, however. The movie offers up plenty of material that will likely soar over kids' heads while making the adults in the room laugh out loud. I enjoyed the film immensely and am looking forward to watching part three in a few years. Who wants to bet Fiona and Shrek will have a few little ogres running around the swamp in ""Shrek 3""?

Once again, the DVD offers up a slew of supplements that will keep you busy long after the end of the film. A commentary track, flubs, interviews, games, and a bunch of other stuff graces the disc. While multiple viewings are probably necessary to catch all the subtle references, I would rather watch the original Shrek a few more times than this film. The first movie is a truly magical experience, lightening in a bottle type magic, which the sequel cannot recapture. Nonetheless, you could do much worse on movie night than giving this platter a whirl.",1114732800,,5292,4.620616365568544
1489099,4,B00005JMQZ,"I didn't get to see Shrek 2 at the theaters, but when it came out on DVD I had a five dollar off coupon to buy it, and did so, hoping my daughter would enjoy it.

I've watched the whole movie and I must say I like it just as much as the original Shrek.  It's not quite as action packed, but it's has a very good plot. (Shrek & Fiona, after enjoying their honeymoon, get summoned to a land called Far Far Away, by Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of that town.  After Dad is very disappointed in seeing his daughter has married an ogre, he and Fiona's Fairy Godmother set into motion a plan to get rid of Shrek and have Fiona fall in love with their planned suitor, Prince Charming, who happens to be the Fairy Godmother's son.  The plan, of course, goes awry.  Shrek is told by his would-be assassin, Puss In Boots, about this, and he tries to find a way to become attractive like Prince Charming.  Meanwhile, the Fairy Godmother and Fiona's father, who soon regrets putting the plan in motion, try to thwart Shrek's plans to become more attractive and pleasing to Fiona.)  Neither I, nor my daughter, thought it was boring in the least, and we loved all the characters.  My favorite was the adorable Puss In Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, though I also like the giant gingerbread man Mungo (I was laughing all the way through his entire scene.)  There is the mandatory jab at Disney, (this time using the Little Mermaid) and also a few laughs at Hollywood's expense (the town Far, Far Away is basically a quasi-medieval Hollywood).  The computer graphics were excellent, maybe a little bit better than the original Shrek, since the human characters seemed more realistically drawn, and all the voices were perfect for the characters (even that of Larry King, who plays a barmaid called The Ugly Stepsister).  The humor is a little on the raunchy and off-color side and like the original Shrek movie there is some unintentional cruelty to animals.  This might be offensive to some adults.  It probably should have gotten a PG-13, but still, I think kids would enjoy it.  The only thing I don't like about the movie is the music.  I thought most of it was bad, the songs ill-timed and it did take away from the movie.

About the DVD--OMG, is it horrible!  First, unlike most DVD's which allow you to press 'Main Menu' and bypass the previews, with this DVD you can't do this--you have to sit through two very long previews.  I haven't timed them, but I'm guessing watching both previews take about five to eight minutes.  I found, at least with my DVD player, that I can fast forward through the previews to the main menu, but I still find doing this irritiating, especially when I know that I don't have to with other DVD's.

Also, I haven't looked at all the bonus material, but that's because the ones that I have viewed are awkward and inconvenient.  I've viewed some of the endings from ""Far Far Away Idol"".  Most seem cute, but unfortunately, with each of the many choices for the winner you have to sit through a long list of credits and I haven't as yet found a way to easily get back to the ""Far Far Away Idol"" menu.  Also, many I've seen were exactly the same with Simon Cowell saying ""That's Rubbish"" and singing ""My Way"".  (That is not his actual singing voice by the way.)  I wished they all had original endings.  I would have liked to have seen all the various character reactions to winning.  The rigamerole that they put you through to get back to this menu doesn't make this 'fun feature' worth it.

I've also tried the various 'Jukeboxes' with the selection of songs from the movie.  They are as much of a pain as 'Far Far Away Idol' is.  When you pick a song, instead of just playing the video for the song, or the scene from the movie with the song, it starts the movie from the point the song was played and continues it.  I also haven't found a way to get back to the Jukebox menu without a lot of hassle.

I've heard a lot of people have returned this DVD and I'm not surprised.  If all Dreamworks DVD's are as incompetent and backward as this one, I'm not getting another one by them again.  If you like this movie and your entertainment center or media storage unit doesn't have magnetic closures and child locks (mine does, unfortunately) I would just get the VHS tape instead of the DVD.  The hassles the 'special features' put you through doesn't make the DVD worth it.",1114128000,,4404,4.455680399500624

""Shrek 2"" is the delightful follow-up to the original 2001 blockbuster, which was a charming fractured fairy tale about a beautiful princess and a lime-green swamp ogre who fell in love and lived happily ever after.  Or did they?  As the second installment opens, all seems quiet on the domestic front as we find Shrek and Fiona living in wedded bliss deep inside an enchanted forest.  One day an invitation arrives from Fiona's royal parents, inviting the two newlyweds to a banquet in honor of their nuptials.  Over Shrek's strenuous objections, the couple journeys to the kingdom called ""Far, Far Away,"" but when Fiona's father gets a gander at who his daughter has married - as well as the ogre-like transformation that has taken place in Fiona herself - the King decides it's time to take matters into his own hands and bring an end to this union.

The marvel of the ""Shrek"" movies is that they function on different levels for different audiences.  Children enjoy them for their fast pace, elemental slapstick and bright, splashy backgrounds, while adults savor them for their sophisticated humor, sly parody, clever puns and playful anachronisms.  As with the original, the pop culture references in ""Shrek 2"" come fast and furious, but the film also has fun turning the conventions of the fairy tale form inside out.  What's impressive about both ""Shrek"" movies is that the filmmakers are willing to follow their instincts and imaginations wherever they lead them and, thus, the writers have the confidence to throw almost anything into the mix if it suits their purposes.  As a result, the film feels continually fresh and inventive, constantly renewing itself as it goes along.

There is excellent voiceover work by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders, all of whom take full measure of each of their respective characters.  But it is Eddie Murphy, as the insecure wiseacre sidekick, Donkey, and Antonio Banderas, as a Musketeering cat known as Puss-in-Boots, who wind up stealing the show.

Visually, ""Shrek 2"" is nothing short of a masterpiece, a seamless blending of otherworldly fairy tale backdrops with contemporary urban images.  It's hard to imagine how much further animation can go in creating worlds that are both surreal and strikingly believable at the same time.

While I love that Dreamworks aims to make quality, non-Disney-esque animated pictures, I must lament that it has yet to make something timeless. Katzenberg once pulled off this feat with Beauty and the Beast. Pixar does it as a matter of routine.

Dreamworks has yet to do so.

The highlight of this movie is the updated muffin-man joke. Beyond that shining moment, I can only dream of what might have been. It is horribly sad to see a film with the combined talents of Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, and one of my personal favorites: John Cleese--fail to exploit their riches.

That Antonio Banderas outshines them all tells you something.

However, I was disappointed with the soundtrack on Shrek 2.

The soundtrack on Shrek was fabulous: Stay Home, All Star, Bad Reputation, I'm on My Way, My Beloved Monster, You Belong to Me, Hallelujah,... I loved every song; and every song enhanced the scene that it accompanied.  Conversely, I found the soundtrack on Shrek 2 to range from unappealing to atrocious and ill-fitting.  It is primarily disposable!! pop that detracts from rather than enhancing scenes.

Two most notable casualties:
The style, the lyrics, and the tempo of ""Ever Fallen in Love"" were wrong for the escaping from the potion factory scene.  Another scene killer was ""Changes"" by Butterfly Boucher--a butchery of a terrific David Bowie song.  Even had it been the original, it was too heavy for the scene.",1111363200,,930,4.8789808917197455

This a movie for all ages and with some wacky hidden symbols in the movie that only adults may see. I recently purchased this DVD and do not regret it since, it is loaded with special features (Although the ""Far Far Away Idol"" is not as good as they make it out to be).

The second takes where the first left off-- Shrek and Fionna are now married. Now, Shrek has to deal with one hurdle- the in-laws who are not to happy to see their daughter return home as a orge. Especially her dad who secretly made a deal with a fairy godmother that her son- prince charming would marry Fiona and become King. Shrek's new in-law dad goes to the extent of hiring a hit man an adorable pussy-cat made Puss who is probably the BEST part of this movie. Eventually Puss, Donkey, and Shrek team up to give Princess Fioana what they think she wants-- a chance to be her ""old"" self again-- with a couple of screw-ups and twists along the way.

I love this film especially the animation that is virtually real as you see hair move on the characters and shadows... it is truly increadiable. I also love of course the newly added Puss I wish I could adopt that kitty and take him home. Dreamworks made the right decision in taking so much time, money, and effort into this film for it is simply astounding and a classic that I am sure is going to be around for ages.

Picking up from where Shrek left off, Shrek 2 continues to shed light on the lovable duo and the rest of the original entourage, while adding more, new characters, that are equally, if not more, adorable.

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

Still, whether it was good or bad, you have to admit it was over-marketed. Let's see how it turned out, shall we?

Shrek 2

Here's how it ranked...

Sound: 1.5/5

Let's be honest here. The sound quality itself was excellent, and the voices were well-voiced, but large parts of the movie were consumed by dorky musical numbers that got on my nerves. The music they chose didn't even make sense. There was absolutely no reason for using a totally uncool music track like ""La Vida Loca"" at the end of the movie when they could have used something pertinent like ""The Monster Mash.""

Graphics: 5/5

Perfect score here, as expected. Need I say more?

Story Concept: 2/5

Shrek and Fiona are invited to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to meet her mum and dad, then they get caught up in the schemes of the evil fairy godmother, who wants her own son to wed Fiona and wants Shrek dead. Basically, it's ""meet the parents"" with fairy tale characters. No more drama, no more severe emotional states and no more of the monster battles that kept the first movie interesting.

Story Presentation: 1/5

The character of Puss in Boots was a nice addition, but shouldn't have been a permanent one. Donkey acted himself. Fiona was a likable character. Everything else about the movie can go to blazes for all I care because the list of problems I had with it extends past hollywood and into the Pacific. Too many parodies of real-life took away from the parodies of fairy tales in this movie, first off. Secondly, a lot of the movie's themes (and the main villain) were too mature for kids, but the film's scriptwriting, musical numbers and many of the jokes could be forgiven by no one else, making it unsuitable for anyone. The character of Shrek was a fool in this movie, instead of being someone who just doesn't understand at first, and as I've said before, there were no monster fights, so it just wasn't an exciting movie. If you watch the first five minutes or so you might get a few yucks, but leave before they get to the kingdom, because that's when the movie starts to go downhill. I suppose one of my biggest problems, personally, with this film, was that it turned Shrek into a good guy. In the last movie, he was the protagonist, but he wasn't nice. In this one, he was nice, and it got on my nerves. It was obvious that the bad guy of the movie was far more evil than Shrek, and if you ask me, that shouldn't happen. When you have a monster in your movie, that monster should be the bad guy. Even if he has to be an anti-hero for it to work. In this movie, he was the hero, but not a monster anymore. I was disappointed because the first film didn't dumb down the ogre, but this movie did.

Acting: 4/5

A-huh. Antonio Banderas is the best actor in the movie, and has the best role in the movie, which isn't saying much. Donkey isn't bad. In fact, most of the acting is pretty good, but I take points off even in this department because the characters of the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming were unforgivable.

All in All: 2.7/5

This entire movie is nothing but a nonsensicle gaggle of lame songs, mindless jokes and incongruous pop-culture/fairy tale references that screams ""Corporate Garbage."" If you want to watch that kind of movie, do so without your child. Subjecting them to this travesty may scar them for life.",1106438400,,3544,4.457496136012365

Well, Shrek 1 rocked. There's no doubt. But Shrek 2 was incredibly funny, with 10 times more cultural references (Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, Justin Timberlake, etc) and witty banter between the characters. I also found the animation to be richer than the first. And Puss in Boots....quite possibly the greatest character ever! Antonio Banderas joins the cast as this hilarious cat and left me crying with laughter and rolling all over the floor (seriously. people stared. haha) As an 18 year old, this movie left me feeling happy and satisfied that urge for a nice happy movie as opposed to more ""Silence of the Lambs"" types.

The movie has so many pop and cultural references that one needs a scorecard to jot them down.

The background music, filled with such recognizable disco/dance classics as ""Freak Out"", ""Funkytown"", and ""I Need a Hero"" (brilliantly sung by Jennifer Saunders, by the way), is a treat for the ears.

Just looking at that cat makes you laugh. Of course, everyone else did well. Trust me. You will like this one. From beginning to end you will be crying with laughter. Make sure you go see this one.

1489286,5,B00005JMQZ,"This movie is just funny and charming.  I loved so many of the more ""adult"" references and jokes, such as the knights grinding pepper into Shrek's eyes in lieu of pepper spray, and the picture of Justin Timberlake hanging above Fiona's bed.  And I absolutely howled when the Fairy Godmother broke into ""I Need A Hero"".  I was laughing louder than just about anyone in the theatre.  The only complaint I have about the humor is that there seemed to be a bit too much ""underpants"" type humor...it was a bit overly-juvenile at times.  However, this movie is supposed to be for kids and adults alike, so I'll take it with a grain of salt.

The extras on the DVD are cute, ""Idol"" is funny although it kind of grated on the nerves after a while...I got the joke and it was funny, but it just kept going on and on and got a bit boring.

This really is a very funny movie which I plan to watch again and again.",1105488000,,902,4.239766081871345
1489287,5,B00005JMQZ,"I must admit, when I first saw the original ""Shrek"" I was not at all pleased. To be totally honest, I thought it was immature, disgusting and the characters to be totally unlovable...that was until I watched ""Shrek 2"" with an old boyfriend of mine did my mind about Shrek change completely.

This movie is sweet, it's sick, it's totally smart - everything about this film just screams ""insanity"" and with the addition of Puss n' Boots (the loveable but prideful kitten), I couldn't help but swoon at the sight of his huge cute eyes. And although Shrek and Donkey continue to find themselves in a mess of adventures, their ruthless and rather annoying attitude on the situations makes them all the more loveable.

Cameron Diaz returns for the voice as ""Fiona"", one of my more favorite characters. Why she didn't chose to be beautiful, I still don't know why; she still continues to be the one who surprises everybody and inevitably, pulls Shrek and the others out of trouble. Antonio Banderas comes in with his voice for ""Puss n' Boots,"" my personal favorite character, a loveable but fairly conceited kitten who believes he can take down all enemies with his large and gorgeous eyes.

Now onto the DVD extras; I do believe Simon Cowell comes in, voicing himself for ""Far Far Away Idol,"" a semi-hilarious spoof where the viewer can ""choose"" the new singing idol (unfortuantly, if you chose the wrong ""character"" as the new idol, Simon will eventually take over in more than one ways). I wasn't all that impressed with ""Far Far Away Idol"" because it didn't seem to add that much to the movie. What I did enjoy however was the commentaries and some bloopers. What's even more hilarious is the main menu where all the characters fight over nothing.

Now...anything else? What doesn't this movie have? A ruthless ogre, a beautiful princess, two neurotic parents and several talking animals, not to mention an evil fairy godmother...yep, I think Shrek 2's got it all covered. For good laughs and a very unorthodox fairy tale, look no further than Shrek 2.",1105488000,,2049,4.779661016949152
1489288,4,B00005JMQZ,"The movie:  5 stars without a doubt.  I'm an adult and have no inhibitions about going to see such a movie without an accompanying child.  I bought the DVD as soon as it came out and have enjoyed it a couple of times since (both by myself and when my nieces and nephews come to visit).  The multi-level humor appeals to both adults and kids, which  really bumps up the replay value of this movie.

The DVD:  I can't give the DVD a 5 star rating because of one unforgivable flaw: it automatically plays two trailers (Shark Tale and Madagascar, totaling ~3 min) before taking you to the main DVD menu.  Further, the DVD package seems to have been configured in such a way that you can't skip over the trailers to get to the Main menu (menu button and and chapter-skip-forward button are ignored).  Frankly, I have no interest in reliving the VHS-era annoyance of having to fast-forward through the initial fluff each time I watch the movie.

So, for bringing us this gem of a movie, bravo Dreamworks!  For the utterly self-centered marketing decision to force the (annoying) Shark Tale/Madagascar trailers down our throats every time the DVD is played, shame on you Dreamworks.",1105401600,3,1175,4.655339805825243

His hairball attack as he was about to kill Shrek is hysterical. Not one other laugh either before or after that though. I kept asking myself why I was watching this.

Fairy Godmother is evil and stupid, Prince Charming is way to annoying. The evil step sister was a transvestite. On the way to Far, Far Away, Donkey kept asking ""Are we there yet,"" to the point is was aggrevating, not funny.

Thank goodness I only rented it and didn't waste my money buying a movie I will never watch again. I was so disappointed, I didn't even watch the other features offered....ie: ""Idol"" or goofs, etc.

1489347,4,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 1 was a movie filled with spoofs and nonnense and what I thought would be the perfect ending. Shrek 2 pretty much says it's not. Oh, well, 4 stars.

  Shrek and Princess Fiona get married ugly ever after, now celebrating their honeymoon with random hilarity. When Fiona gets an invitation to visit her parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away, Shrek forecasts disaster. Both of them still being ogres does nothing for the Hollywood-esque society.

  With Donkey still tagging along, Shrek and Fiona discover trouble in paradise. Shrek, feeling Fiona is unhappy, gets led astray and seems to have run away. Meanwhile, the King Harold has some troubles with the Fairy Godfather, I mean, Godmother, and her pampered son, Prince Charming.

  Like the first one, the story is pumped with obscure references to fairy tales, movies, and beyond. And fortunately, there's still a workable plot. Shrek, still the reluctant hero and former scapegoat victim of scared men everywhere, battles with himself the value of love versus the truth of how dominating beauty is. The good news is, with allies such as the energetic Donkey and the suave holy-crap he's Antonio Banderas Puss in Boots, he learns to fight to find out. He even becomes human, which I find a minor setback but if it helps him learn, it works.

  Shrek 2 is Shrek's movie; he's the one who in the end regains self-confidence in his character because, well, it's a fairy-tale ending. Good guys win and uncrok champagne, bad guys either are doomed to unviolent ends or fade from sight forever. While glad that they got rid of the Dragon to avoid shortcuts, the climax of the movie is still makes some cry, ""Cheap move."" But with upbeat music and a few dirty jokes, Shrek 2 is an admirable story which breaks the mold that all animated spoof sequels [...].",1105142400,,1816,4.766773162939297

Granted, there were a lot of jokes that still went over their heads, but my son, who is 10, enjoyed the scene where Pinocchio is forced to tell a lie. As for my 6yo daughter, she enjoyed the whole movie. My favorite is watching my 4yo daughter singing ""I Need A Hero"" with the fairy godmother. I also enjoyed how the land of Far, Far Away looked a lot like Beverly Hills. This is a movie that the whole family can enjoy.",1105142400,,528,4.186274509803922

1489350,4,B00005JMQZ,"Ok, so I'm one of those parents that use their kids as excuses to see children's movies I love. Having said that, this was an adult movie that kids will love too. Most of the jokes will fly over children's heads (no, nothing raunchy or overtly sexual) but the parents should listen intently, because there are some great lines in this one. The whole in-law theme was hysterical for anyone whose had to deal with mental in-laws. The fairy godmother was oh so Hollywood (fake smiles and plastic looks)

Eddie Murphy stole the movie (""HEY, YOU WORKING THAT HAT!!!"") Antonio Banderas follows in the footsteps of famous Latino actors who exhibit a very masculine and charismatic voice (ala Raul Julia and Ricardo Montalban). Having said that, I have read a number of reviews that talk about how his character Puss in Boots stole the show, and I have to say that I still think the Donkey was uproariously funny and that Puss was just a cute and clever sidekick.

1489351,4,B00005JMQZ,"If you found the first Shrek movie to be a treat, this one will be equally so.  Shrek 2 features a more complicated plot with many, many references which the kids might not get, but the adults certainly will.  For those of you who enjoyed the beginning and very end of Shrek, but felt the middle dragged a bit, you may feel that Shrek 2's begining is somewhat borring.  about half-way through, however, the movie seems to pick up and become the old shrek that we all fell in love with (even if shrek himself isn't the same).  This DVD also packs with it a special ""ending"" where you vote for the ""far, far away idol"" after several performances by the characters.  There are only four real outcomes (If Simon, yes that Simon, doesn't like who you chose, they don't win).  There are lots of things to see on this DVD, including some of the more interesting moments in the animation process and cast bios.

If you loved shrek, this movie is sure to please, but for those who didn't enjoy the first, you'll probably feel the same way about the second.",1104710400,2,1047,4.421875
1489352,2,B00005JMQZ,"The movie isn't funny. It's as if the writers created a fluke in the original Shrek, tried to take the elements of greatness from the first movie and add it to the second, and failed because they didn't know what those elements are. The dialogue simply stinks. The plot isn't funny. Shrek has to meet the inlaws who expect a man instead of an ogre. He realizes this, his wife apparently doesn't, and he stresses before the uneventful journey, during it, and after it. Shrek doesn't act like an ogre, but as a bugged husband. Donkey, on this long trip, constantly asks ""Are we there yet?"" Yeah, that's always been a great joke in movies.

What the makers of this movie believe hooks you will be the facial expressions (particularly of Fiona, and her constantly moving hair) and the soundtrack. The soundtrack is almost obnoxious to a point where it felt like I was being sold a soundtrack album while I'm watching a movie. Instead of the music complementing the scenes of the movie, it definitely felt like it was the other way around. Stick popular hits in the movie, and throw some scenes around it. That'll get the audience loving the movie!

You'll enjoy the last 10 minutes of the movie for its action. You'll wonder what the writers were thinking by making the first half of the movie nothing more than a marital tiff.

I gave the movie 2 stars based entirely on the animation. The animation was brilliant. The rest of the movie was worth 0 stars. It didn't get a star for the TV spoofs that weren't funny. It didn't get a star for the rehashed jokes of the first movie that weren't funny. The original Shrek didn't try to copy a formula. This one did.

If you're like most people, you won't find this movie funny at all, and you'll wonder why anybody else did. Watching this will keep you sort of entertained, you'll like the end, but like I'm doing here, you'll probably recommend it to nobody (or you'll warn them to have their expectations low).",1104537600,2,1954,4.542613636363637

Though I enjoyed the movie, I was upset that my kids had seen it. They, of course, didn't get a lot of the jokes, but the content of the film wasn't as mild as the first Shrek. The Fairy Godmother was portrayed as an evil entity seeking gain for herself. The transvestite 'barmaid' raised some questions as did Pinocchio wearing a womens' red thong for underwear. Throughout the whole film, the parental characters were trying to undermine Fiona's marriage to Shrek, hoping that she would choose someone 'normal' looking (ie Prince Charming, who had no personality) as opposed to someone like Shrek, although she really loved him and was happy that way.

Next time Dreamworks puts out an animated film, I'll not be so trusting that it'll be for my kids to see. I'll give that trust to Disney instead.",1104364800,2,959,4.641176470588236

The classic characters played by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy are accompanied by a host of new talent. Above all newcoming actors, I loved the part of Puss in Boots played by Antonio Banderas: he was perfect for the role. Also, if you enjoyed the fun the first one made of other movies and TV shows, you will crack up to Shrek 2, as not even Lord of the Rings is safe this time around.

It is safe to say that this is no movie for kids, though the more grown-up ones may get most of the humor on it. The lines are clearly meant for a more mature audience.

You see, the thing about these films is this: they are made for EVERYONE.  There are jokes that little kids can enjoy...there are jokes that adults can enjoy...there are even jokes that my isolated age group can enjoy (jokes of a clean nature, I might add).

The plot of the ""Shrek"" sequal is this: Shrek and Fiona are married.  Great.  Only problem is this: Fiona wants Shrek to meet ma and pa.  Ma and Pa, by the way, are King and Queen.  They do not take kindly to their daughter being an ogre who married an ogre.  The Fairy Godmother, whose son Prince Charming was ""destined"" to be Fiona's husband, doesn't like it, either.  Ms. Fairy Godmother decides that Fiona must fall in love with Charming...at whatever price.

Featuring the voices of (here we go): Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas (whose Puss-in-Boots just may be one of the greatest animated characters ever), Julie Andrews, and John Cleese.  ""Shrek 2"" naturally has a disadvantage here: it's not original.  That'd be the first ""Shrek"" film.  However, as a sequal, it does pretty well.  If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love this one.  If you didn't see the first one...see it, then see this one.  Both of them are animated masterpieces.

1489633,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) return in this hilarious sequel to the blockbuster original.  Shrek and Fiona have returned to their beloved swamp after their honeymoon, but when they get home, they find that they've been summoned by Fiona's parents to the kingdom of Far, Far, Away to have their marriage blessed by Fiona's father.  Shrek is very hesitant to embark on this journey, but Fiona finally persuades him to go.

Upon arrival, Fiona's parents are shocked to see that Fiona has turned into an Ogre, and they are equally stunned to meet Shrek and Donkey.  Fiona's father immediately hatches a plan with Fairy Godmother to foil Fiona's marriage and have Fairy Godmother's son Prince Charming wed Fiona.

Meanwhile, Shrek and Donkey run into Puss-n-Boots, a cat assassin hired by Fairy Godmother to stop them.  However, Shrek forms a bond with Puss-n-Boots, and they journey to Fairy Godmother's castle, where they find a potion that will turn Shrek and Fiona into normal people again.

Upon drinking the potion, Shrek is transformed and rushes to show Fiona, who has also been transformed as well.  But Fairy Godmother is waiting and captures Shrek, while Prince Charming has convinced Fiona that he is Shrek.  Will Shrek get to Fiona?  Will Fairy Godmother succeed in having Prince Charming and Fiona married?

This is a highly entertaining and funny movie.  Eddie Murphy is wonderful as Donkey and Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers are excellent as well.  I watched this movie with my 5 year old and 3 year old children, and they loved it.  I highly recommend this film.  It is appropriate for children and adults, and the story will keep everyone interested.  Watch this movie and have a fun time with your children.",1101859200,3,1757,4.925170068027211
1489634,5,B00005JMQZ,"As a rule, sequels typically just can't live up to their hype.  There are only a few exceptions to the rule-a few sequels that are every bit as good as the original.  And, once in a blue moon, a sequel comes along that's actually better than the original. Shrek 2 is one of those rare sequels-it has more laughs and more fun than 2001's Shrek.

Mike Myers returns as Shrek, the lovable yet somewhat crusty ogre.  After he and his beloved Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) return from their honeymoon, they receive an invitation from Fiona's parents, asking the happy couple to venture to the kingdom of Far Far Away for a ball to celebrate their marriage. Together with Donkey (Eddie Murphy), they make the long, long trip to Far Far Away, where Fiona's parents are in for a big surprise-their daughter has married and ogre, and she's turned into an ogre, too.  Fiona's father (John Cleese), the king, is mortified-since he promised the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) that her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), would marry Fiona-and he hires Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek.

Shrek 2 sold millions of copies in its first days on DVD-and for good reason.  To kids, it's a fun fairy tale (it's rated PG-and not G-for a reason, though most kids probably won't catch most of the subtle crude jokes and references), but there are also enough pop-culture references and inside grown-up jokes to keep Mom and Dad busy.  And the laughs (for all ages) are pretty much non-stop.  It's one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over-and Mom and Dad won't complain.",1101859200,3,1590,4.731884057971015

Everyone loves the gingerbread man!  I am really glad that they didn't do away with the extra ""side"" characters from the first movie--the Three Little Pigs and Pinnochio do make a few appearances.  Then, they also added new characters like Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf--with a comedic twist of course!  I highly recommend this movie to individuals and families alike.

Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was hilarious and I loved Ruper Everett's small but choice role as Prince Charming.  The overall message was good for kids and parents alike: love yourself for who you are and parents should accept their children's choices and respect that.

I was a little disappointed at the end when they chose to go back to their ogre selves because honestly, I know beauty is only skin deep, it's what inside that counts and all, but...they're pretty butt ugly.  But hey, at least they have each other.

It just sends a message to studios that the consumer market is so stupid it will accept being forced to sit through a commercial after paying $20 for a movie. Yes, Dreamworks is really grabbing for the cash this time. Instead of a sleeve thing or booklet in the DVD case, there was a bunch of coupons and offers to buy other retarded Shrek related junk. Also, the ""special features"" were really lame (there was only one notable one,) and the DVD is only one disk. Good Lord, Dreamworks is lame. I hate them now and will never pay money to see their movies in any way shape, or form. Frankly, they insult me.

1489690,4,B00005JMQZ,"Dreamwork's squuel to the first Shrek, Shrek 2 sits uneasuily at the juxtaposition of the two dominant themes of modern large scale animations - new school graphics, razor sharp humour and social commentary combined with old school traditional Disney morals. The basic story of the movie is pretty old hat. Shrek and Fiona (Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz), married at the end of Shrek 1 travel to Far Away land to meet Fiona's aristocratic parents in their enormous castle. Unsurprisingly, her folks don't warm to the fact that she has brought home an ogre for a husband. A plot is hatched with the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders)to usurp Shrek with her son, the smooth, cherry glitter lips Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and mayhem ensues as Shrek with the help of Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and the unlikely Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) strive to win Fiona back.

This is a fun but cliched Disney style story laying down classic morals at every turn (it's not how you look it's who you are etc...). Nothing much in the storyline then to recommend Pixar as the heir to Disney as purveyors of classic family animation.

What does set Shrek 2 apart however is the bombardment of witty, sharp, subtle humour. It is everywhere. You have to watch this movie more than once to pick up all of the jokes. There are visual gags featuring Starbucks (Farbucks), Hollywood, Tower Records, Subway and Disney. Parodies of other movies such as Lord of the Rings, Spiderman and Mission Impossible and ludicrous parodies of popular music culture - my favourite being the Fairy Godmother sprawled over the piano at the wedding ball blasting out a version of Bonnie Tyler's 'Holding out for a Hero'. And maybe I am reading too much into this but I am sure the post magic potion 'handsome' Shrek bears more than an accidental resemblence to British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, another Scot left seething at the hands of a more glamorous adversary. By the end the combination of super fast, super hi-tech detailed animation and plethora of gags threatens to overload.

All this and the voices are getting slicker too. The first Shrek utilized Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy in an unlikely but successful style and Shrek 2 builds on this by adding John Cleese, Jennifer Saunders, Rupert Everett and a ludicrous part for Antonio Banderas as the smouldering but sensitive latino Puss in Boots.

Where will Dreamworks go from here? The plot massively lags behind the super slick animation, voices and tangental jokes. Their scriptwriters need to remedy this disjuncture in order to create genuinely groundbreaking and original children's animations in the future.",1101168000,3,2666,4.9708520179372195
1489691,4,B00005JMQZ,"After viewing the first Shrek movie in theaters, I was very excited when I found out they were making a Shrek 2.  The first movie was a funny, heartwarming animated film for adults and children of all ages. With fairy tale characters and jokes for not just kids, but adults as well, Shrek is a great movie to add to anyone's library.  Shrek 2 I feel lived up to the expectations left by the first movie and beyond.

 Shrek 2 brings back all the lovable characters from the first movie and some new comers. Old favorites like Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Shrek (Mike Myers), and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and new comers like Puss - in - Boots ( Antonio Banderas), Prince Charming ( Rupert Everett) and  The Queen ( Julie Andrews).

 Shrek 2 begins after the wedding of Princess Fiona and Shrek. Thinking things can not get any better; Shrek and Princess Fiona are invited to go visit Fiona's parents in her former kingdom, Far Far Away.  Shrek believes this to be not a very good idea and he is right.  Bringing Donkey along for the visit makes the adventure even more interesting and of course funnier. When they reach the kingdom Fiona's parents are very unhappy with their daughter's transformation into an Ogress and Fiona's father, King, makes a deal with the fairy Godmother for her son, Prince Charming, to marry Fiona.  The God - Mother and King team up and do anything they can to get rid of Shrek.

 With the great computer animation and witty jokes Shrek 2 is a must see for everyone. I feel Shrek 2 takes animation and fairy tale stories to a whole new level. With the added adult humor and spoofs from many other movies, Shrek 2 lives up to the expectations left by the first Shrek movie.  The only bad thing I found about Shrek 2 is the fewer musical numbers it has compared to the first one.

 Shrek 2 is one movie I could watch over and over. With awesome new characters and great jokes, Shrek 2 is great entertainment for all ages. With the musical numbers and witty comedy Shrek 2 brings the fairy tale characters we grow up with life.  This movie is must see for anyone who loves to laugh and is a kid a heart and is great for the whole family.",1101168000,5,2151,4.407594936708861
1489692,4,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"" has a tough job; after the startlingly original ""Shrek"", a film that turned nursery rhymes and expectations upside down, this sequel needed to find a new, also twisted angle to meet the expectations of the original's fans.  Unfortunately, the plot is predictable:  Shrek and Fiona, newly married, are invited to Fiona's parents' kingdom where they are met with distaste.  Naturally Prince Charming feels cheated, as does his mother, Fairy Godmother, and the King especially is mortified that his daughter has brought home an ogre.  Shrek and Fiona are taught what they learn in the first movie, that looks are nothing compared to inner beauty.

But don't give up on ""Shrek 2.""  This sequel is rescued by the fabulously complex and hilarious new character Puss 'n' Boots.  As Shrek says, not many cats can pull off wearing boots and Antonio Banderas's Puss does it with style.  Throw in some lightning quick spoofs of ""Zorro,"" ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Mission Impossible,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and many other films.  Mock the cast of nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters. Sprinkle pop culture and music as a counterpoint to the traditional timelessness of fairy tales, and you've got an amusing tale that warrants a second watching just to catch all the references.

Children will love this ""ogre tale"" for its non-threatening suspense and the etiquette-challenged behavior of the two ogres, while adults will appreciate the pop culture references.  Although not as fresh as the original, ""Shrek 2"" offers entertainment for all ages.",1101168000,33,1562,5.158730158730159

With great reluctance, Shrek and Fiona go to visit their parents in a land far, far away but the parents are not even aware that their daughter is in fact an ogre.

Shrek 2 starts where the last one ended with Shrek and Fiona returning from their honeymoon.  Not only do they arrive home to find that Donkey has all but moved into their humble abode, but to receive an invitation from Fiona's parents to visit and make known her husband. Shrek, of course, tries to convience Fiona that this is a bad idea as he is sure mommy and daddy do not know their little girl is a green orge, as is her husband.  Add in the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming (who was supposed to be the rescuer) and you have a plot thickening.

Donkey is loveable as usual, but an important addition to this movie is that of Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) as the would be assassign, who all but steals the show this time around.  Fiona is placed on the backburner so your ""lady in distress"" scenerio is all but out the window to a point.

Kids will love the tried and true in this sequal, and the adults will love the jokes and inuendos.  Note:  it is funnier if you are up and hip on popular culture.  Look for references to Micheal Jackson and Justin Timberlake, et al.

Basic plot: Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon to find Donkey at odds with Dragon, and are immediately invited to meet Fiona's royal parents in the land of Far, Far Away. They undertake this journey (in what may well be the funniest travelling sequence of all time), only to be confronted by innate hostility on behalf of Fiona's father (an extremely engaging John Cleese). From there, all sorts of havoc ensues involving a malicious fairy godmother, a would-be feline assasin by the name of Puss - n- boots (Antonio banderas, stealing every scene his character is in) and, inevitably, demonstrating that true love does indeed conquer all.

If you enjoyed ""Shrek"", you will most assuredly be delighted with the razor sharp, good natured and wondrous adventure that is ""Shrek 2.""

I say their very much on par with each other. The plot, the additions to the cast, the characters and their portrayal all made this movie.

Having said that, I'm going to say that the majority of the negative comments made about this DVD are asanine. First, why would you return a movie that you love for the simple reason that you can't skip past a couple previews at the beginning of the movie. I saw this movie on DVD almost a week before it was released on Nov. 9. (I work in video rental store, which has it's great perks!) Over half way through the movie my DVD player decided it wanted to freeze the movie, so I had to take the DVD out clean the eye on the player, and reinsert the movie, and watch everything from the beginning. Did I complain? No, because I found a very useful invention that Dreamworks didn't disable called the Fast Forward button, much like the one that used to be found on VCR controls. Now that you know you have the tools use them!

Secondly, don't complain that you just bought a single disc DVD that doesn't say Special, or Collector's, Edition on it. At a time when the fab thing in Hollywood is to release a movie followed by it's Director's/Special/Collector's Edition a couple months later, what did you expect? But then again, I guess most of you were thinking what you were normally thinking, absolutely nothing!

If you truly like the movie, don't complain when the DVD you bought doesn't have everything you ever dreamed of on it. But honestly, if you are a collector I would suggest you wait until the release the special edition, considering you have to know it's coming when this copy doesn't say special edition, and it is the highest grossing comedy of all time. (Third highest grossing movie of all time.) In other words, if you don't like what you have at the moment concerning this DVD: get over it!",1100736000,5,1998,4.438692098092643

I love this film. It's witty, original and full of surprises. There just isn't enough action to keep a younger child engaged. Most of the excitement comes from the very mature and well-developed plot, not the animation (which is also outstanding).

Though the plot is not as strong as the first movie, it still conveys the message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I personally loved the movie innuendos (Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones) throughout the film, and while the younger audience probably did not catch on to those, it still appeals to the children through its quirky and somewhat slap-stick humor.  What made the movie was the fairy godmother character twisted into an evil and back-stabbing b*tch.  I thought that was extremely clever.

While not quite as good as its predecessor, it still deserves 5 stars in my book.  Definitely a must-own DVD (and make sure it's the DVD because the Far Far Away Idol extra is definitely something to look at.  It's hilarious!)",1100649600,,937,4.782608695652174

It turns donkey into a pure white mare and Shrek into a human. But in order to make it perminant he must kiss Fiona. But now he must get Fiona back before Charming does.

Disney DVDs are front-loaded with commercials as well, but if you hit Main Menu you get the main menu and you can bypass them.  On this puppy, you are stuck.

With more spoofs than the first and a better storyline, Shrek 2 really lived up to the challenge of being a better movie. The story in this one is: After a wonderful honeymoon, Fiona wants her and Shrek to travel to the land of Far Far Away to meet her parents, the King and Queen. But of course, her parents are surprised to see that Fiona is an ogre.

1489897,4,B00005JMQZ,"Overall, Shrek 2 was a pretty good movie.  Having said that, I'd like to add that most of the humor went over the head of my three-year-old son and my eighteen-month-old ignored the movie entirely.  I get very annoyed when people assume that because a movie is animated that children of any age will enjoy it.  Also, I really don't like the amount of crude humor that comes along with the Shrek movies.  Isn't it possible to make a movie funny without using crude humor?  (Kind of crude but completely hilarious was the scene with Pinocchio and the women's underwear!)  At this time, I'm going to revise my opening line to say the following: Overall, Shrek 2 was a pretty good movie for older children, teenagers and adults.

I'm rating this four stars, as a mother of young children.  It would be a five if the audience in my home only included older people.",1100476800,,859,4.532467532467533
1489898,2,B00005JMQZ,"Starting with the positive, this film looks incredible. Wonderful art direction, lighting, character design and animation. A real treat for the eyes.

The rest of it left me wishing this had been a silent film. The basic story is good but the dialogue would have benefitted from some re-writing. The script left me with the impression it was written by someone who watches too much television and never reads. I give them credit for having the strength to fly in the face of the idea that comedy should be creative, unpredictable and original but ultimately it was not the best choice. For example, on a long journey a character asking ""are we there yet?"" is so predictable and cliche it should always be avoided.

The characters don't grow or undergo development beyond where we left them in the first film. In fact the message of this film negates the message of the first (outer appearances are less important than what's inside): here we find that Fiona wants the green-skinned ogre even though Shrek does not change inside. The donkey also has not grown; he's still annoying to a degree that makes Jar Jar Binks (Star Wars) seem intelligent, eloquent and welcome. I enjoyed Puss in Boots, a strong character and great addition to the cast. The funniest moments were all his. (The hairballs gag was great up until the point the directors felt it necessary to explain it away by having the cat say ""hairballs"".)

Overall this film took the first film's weaknesses (pop-cultural references, pop songs, crude gags) and expanded on them while rejecting the first film's strengths (originality, strong characters, theme). Apparently the references to other films, television shows and media events are ""for the grown-ups"" but I was left with the feeling they couldn't think of anything funny to fill the moment so they were forced to add another pointless reference that never serves the story or characters. I'm not sure why a character doing something that's done in another film or TV show is supposed to be funny; it certainly isn't original.

I'm sure kids will love this, it simply is a beautiful piece of animation. The rest of us will be left wondering why a sequel to something so original was considered necessary. I would have given this three stars but the cynical marketing (as others have pointed out) at the beginning of the disc is beneath Dreamworks and worth a negative star. I'm not sure why they sunk to it. I hope one of their representatives will read some of these comments and think twice before taking advantage of their customers on future releases.",1100476800,2,2574,4.843181818181818
1489899,3,B00005JMQZ,"Lots of people are complaining about the unskippable previews at the beginning of this disk, and rightfully so.  It's a dirty, annoying tactic some movie studios use and it has to stop.  If it weren't for that irritation the Shrek 2 DVD would earn 4 stars.

Another issue I have with this release is it's use of the dreaded DVD double-dip ploy.  Notice that Shrek 2 is only one disk?  Notice how this is not labeled a 'special edition'?  Mark my words, Dreamworks will release a fuller, superior version of this film at a later date.  They want to maximize their profits by forcing those of us who insist on the best and unwittingly bought the first version to buy both releases.

I didn't realize Dreamworks had done this until I took a second look at the DVD case cover.  Well, darn it, I will NOT buy the special edition Shrek 2 when it comes out!

Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, I can describe the positive things Shrek 2 has going for it:

--Good plot, great computer animation, lively characters.

--A positive message in the story, a rarity in today's filmmaking.

--Universal appeal to all ages.

--Knights; the most hilarious scene in the movie.

--The extra Far, Far Away Idol bonus feature.  It actually wasn't that funny to me and I didn't like how most of the choices ended with the same result, but it was still nice to have.",1100390400,5,1350,4.448979591836735

When they get there, the parents don't rub with Shrek at first. The father wants him out and to have Prince Charming in.

I will say, though, that I think PDI-Dreamworks would have been better served if they'd just made a Puss-in-Boots full-length movie, with Shrek as a secondary character (or possibly co-star); you know, a more original, story-driven movie, maybe, and one not obviously geared to milk the cash cow.  I've always thought Disney should have made a Puss-in-Boots movie (when Disney was making anything actually worth watching, anyway) and PDI-DW missed the boat somewhat by reducing the character to mere window dressing (although, the window dressing in this case is more interesting than everything else in the film).  They could have told a rousing, funny adventure story that stood the test of time instead of something that ultimately features ""Living La Vida Loca"" as its punchline (how many people even remember Ricky Martin these days?) and, on the DVD, an unfunny send-up of ""American Idol.""  Bleh.

All in all, I think PDI-DW is more interested in pop-culture references, in-jokes and bashing Disney than creating quality animation and telling interesting and exciting stories and that's just a damn shame.  The premise of parodying fairy tales is a good one, but PDI-DW doesn't do enough with it.  The end result is just...blah...",1100304000,4,1474,5.138075313807532
1489981,5,B00005JMQZ,"2001's biggest animated hit was of course Shrek.  The film took the fairy tale genre and gave it a good swift kick in the backside by turning the story upside down, with hilarious results.  So for DreamWorks the challenge was put forward to release a sequel that would be just as funny as the original, if not funnier.

The end result came this May with the release of Shrek 2, which would go on to become one of the biggest hit movies of the year, taking in more than $440 million in its run and busting the record for the biggest opening weekend for an animated film ($108 million), shattering the mark set by rival Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo.

The story of Shrek 2 picks up right after the events of the original Shrek.  Shrek and Fiona (Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz) are on their honeymoon and come home to find that Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been ""taking care"" of their place while they are gone, and I use that term LOOSELY.  Moments later, they are summoned to the kingdom of Far, Far Away so Fiona's parents can meet her new hubby and grant their blessing on the couple.

Needless to say the meeting isn't going exactly as planned when the King and Queen of Far, Far Away (John Cleese, Julie Andrews)learn that not only is their daughter an ogre, but now she's married to one.  While the Queen is accepting of the twosome, the King is less than thrilled and determines that Shrek needs to be done away with.

To make things worse, the King is found to be in cahoots with a fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders of ""Absolutely Fabulous"")to have her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) marry Fiona instead of Shrek.  He conspires with them to have a well known ogre-killer, Puss in Boots (hilariously voiced by Antonio Banderas)get rid of Shrek and set things right.

But when the plan fails, and the plan is ultimately revealed to Shrek and Donkey, they set out to give Fiona the happily ever after she deserves.

The film contains some hilarious moments, especially thanks to Puss (you try not to sit and say ""aw[...]"" while he makes that cute face)and a few of the old crew who return from the original Shrek, including Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man.  Also, there are a few fun potshots taken at current and past pop culture icons (one involving a certain former boy-band member takes the cake).  Also, a few other famous voices join in the fun, including of all people Larry King (!!) as a...well, I won't give it away since it is so funny.  There are a few jokes in the movie that only adults will get, but otherwise it's a riot for all ages.

In addition, the DVD contains a special exclusive created for it: a hilarious parody of ""American Idol"" called Far Far Away Idol, featuring 11 of the characters in the film singing their favorite songs, along with an animated Simon Cowell and you the viewer get to choose who is the winner.

So, if you loved the first two films and just can't wait until Shrek 3 is out in 2006, then pick this up to tide you over.  If you saw the first and didn't want to get caught in the mad rush in the theaters, get this one to get caught up.  You definitely want to get this if you don't want to be green with envy...",1100217600,2,3161,4.437716262975779

1489987,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is the follow-up sequel to the hit ""Shrek"" and in many ways is better than the original.

Basically, Shrek and Fionna visit Fionna's parents where Prince Charming and his mom, the Fairy Godmother, are scheming to have Fionna fall in love with Prince Charming.

This is a great movie for kids with funny characters and songs, but the real enjoyment will be for the parents.  This movie seems to have many more jokes directed at adults than the original.  One aspect I enjoyed were the layers upon layers of jokes that were perhaps in the background and intended to be observed by the astute movie watcher.  The movie didn't force these things down our throat.  Shrek 2 spoofs many more movies that just fairy tales, and I know it'll be enjoyable to watch as my kids watch it over and over.

Of course, this isn't the ""greatest comedy of all time"" as the promotions proclaim.  Sure, it made a lot of money, but what good movie doesn't these days with ticket prices so high.

1490021,4,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 offers enhanced Pixar animation that really is fantastic! The characters and scenery are so well drawn and the special effects are great. The musical numbers are excellent! Nevertheless, there are some pluses and minuses about this DVD; and I will discuss them here.

First of all, the plot is excellent and holds your attention very well. As you may well already know, Fiona and Shrek and now married and Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away Land invite Fiona to bring her new husband Shrek for the official blessing of their new marriage. Shrek fears rejection since Fiona's parents will see that's he's an ogre; and his fears turn out to be true when they finally meet.  By the way, the countless lampoons in this movie are hysterical! For example, Far Far Away Land is suspiciously drawn to resemble a certain California little known town called Beverly Hills. There are numerous references to Disney type stories such as Pinocchio, too. Hahaha!

Of course, the plot thickens further. The King is so upset that Shrek is an ogre he goes to the Fairy Godmother to ""solve"" the problem. The Fairy Godmother agrees to help the King get the ogre killer Puss In Boots to bump off Shrek so her son, Prince Charming, can marry Fiona himself. There are many foul-ups, magical spells and ups and downs along the way; but do not fear! Puss In Boots turns out to be a harmless shadow of a hit man; but so as not to spoil things too much I won't tell you how Shrek and Fiona survive all this!

The voiceovers are also very believable. Julie Andrews was the perfect choice for the Queen, Fiona's mother; and the rest of the cast is equally well chosen. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy work perfectly as both Shrek and Donkey respectively.

The DVD comes in widescreen format here; if you wish full screen format you'll have to buy the other DVD! That was a disappointment since the original Shrek movie came with both versions included on two DVDs. Here you only get one DVD with no insert! Although the DVD is loaded with an alternative ending and many extras for younger kids, it somehow felt like a disappointment that you don't get both the full screen and wide screen versions here. You also have to sit through two brief previews on the DVD; I tried to skip ahead but I couldn't!

The extras are very good, on the other hand. The children get games and even fun things to print out on a computer! (Better get some quality paper for that, however, parents.) There are interviews and behind the scenes looks at the making of the movie. There's a nice help feature for newcomers to the DVD format; I liked this.

All in all, this is a great movie on DVD. I give it four stars primarily because I was disappointed about not having any package inserts and not getting both the full screen version in addition to the widescreen version. The extras seemed to be fewer than the ones that came with the first Shrek movie, too. Parents who are sensitive to certain ""suggestive content"" might hesitate until they feel their children are ready for it. Nevertheless, the actual movie and the quality of the extras that you do get are superb and so I highly recommend this for children and adults.",1100131200,5,3198,4.570680628272251

The voices are perfect, the mating of the voices, actions of the characters are top notch. Kids young and old will enjoy this one. And watch out for the cat, he almost steals the show.

We demand a third Shrek film with the central characters and a few new ones to add to the mix. Great stuff, enjoy and share with your friends and children.",1100044800,,798,4.348993288590604
1490126,3,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"" suffers mightily from sophmore slump.  The bloom is definitely off the rose as far as the look is concerned; been there, done that, you know.  And the first half-hour or so is completely devoid of humor.  Everyone yells, everyone bickers and it isn't until the arrival of the ridiculously hilarious Puss-in-Boots (Bravo Bandares!) that the film starts to pick up some steam.  Ultimately its heart is in the right place (thus the 3 stars instead of 2), but ""Shrek 2"" is decidely a rental, not a buy.  (And what's with all the lousy songs?)",1100044800,,548,4.666666666666667
1490127,4,B00005JMQZ,"Sequels normally do one of three things:  1)They are complete and utter failures that damage the ""franchise"" of a certain character or storyline 2)They are good, but just not as good as the original or, and this is the rarest of all, 3)they are head and shoulders above the original.

Ironically, ""Shrek 2"" doesn't fit in any of these categories.  It simply picks up where the first movie ended and rolls along with the story.  In this sequel, or continuation, we find Shrek and Fiona married and ready to live a life of happily ever after.  Unfortunately, with marriage comes in-laws, and they are anxious to see their daughter and her new beau.  What ensues is sort of like ""Meet The Parents"" and Grimm's fairy tales all rolled into one.

Like the original, there is plenty of humor for the adults and the children.  I do think this film is a little tamer than its predecessor in the adult humor vein, though.

There are some new characters, such as Puss-In-Boots, who is played by Antonio Banderas.  He steals the show as the adorable little cut-throat assassin.  Jennifer Saunders(of Ab-Fab fame) is devilishly funny as the Fairy Godmother.  Julie Andrews and John Cleese lend their voices to Shrek's in-laws.  Rupert Everett is as vain as ever as Prince Charming.

Old characters that return include the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, and the gender-confused Big, Bad Wolf.  Of course, no Shrek movie would be a Shrek movie without Donkey.  Eddie Murphy is still the top comic foil in this sequel, but he has to share it with Banderas' Puss.

Overall, the movie is just as good as the first one.  If you enjoyed the original, you'll have no problem digesting this one.  The DVD extras are fun, especially the ""Far, Far Away Idol"" bit.  There are games for older kids, introductions to many of the characters and a few goofs.  These goofs, however, just don't seem to fit on this disc.  They come across as filler and nothing else.

So, buy this if you have a youngster or even if you don't.  It's a fun comedy that is sure to bring a smile to any face.",1100044800,,2092,4.607046070460704

1490129,3,B00005JMQZ,"I loved Shrek.  In fact I cannot remember the last time I laughed so loudly at an animated film.  It was so charming and so funny, I could not get enough of it.  S2 is fine, but it seems to be pushing too much product and trying too hard to satirize the real world, that a lot of the original charm seems to be gone here.

Myers is great and Murphy is still outrageously funny, but again the story does not allow them to play with as much whimsey as its predecessor.  Banderas and Saunders are great additions to the mix and really seem to enjoy their characters.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but I would have enjoyed it more if the original wasn't so darn charming.  Definitely worth seeing - the animation is better than ever- but don't be surprised if you feel it lacks a little something.",1100044800,2,805,4.256578947368421
1490130,5,B00005JMQZ,"I bought this movie three days ago and I have already watched it three times. This movie is so enjoyable. If you liked the first Shrek, you will be very satisfied with the second. All I can say is, this movie makes me smile every time I watch it. The addition of Puss in Boots was brilliant, he brings so much to the movie, cute little kitty mew mew. Altough, I think there is a tie for my favorite new character between Puss and Mongo (the giant ginger bread man). Although Mongo has a small and short part, he is great. It was a real tearjerker when he had to go.

I also enjoyed the fact that Gingy and Pinocchio, etc. played bigger parts in this one because those guys are quite hilarious. Their voices just kill me and their jokes are simply side-splitting. My favorite sequence in the movie is when Shrek rides Mongo through the city while Fairy Godmother is singing her song to get Charming and Fiona to kiss, it was so well done. Charming is another new character that I thought brought a lot to the table.

This movie is very very enjoyable. With it's blend of new characters, our favorites from the first, and new array of silliness and jokes, it's a hit. I almost forgot, the music in Shrek 2 was also very well picked. I commend the writers on this movie. Two thumbs up, five stars, it's one that I will watch numerous times and enjoy each time.

1490133,4,B00005JMQZ,"I can certainly relate to a consumer's irritation when we shell out a bunch of money and have to sit through marketing advertisements... this happens at every movie theater I've been to. However, with all the so-called ""reviewers"" complaining about the trailers at the start of the disc I am astounded how few of them have figured out how to use the ""scan"" on their DVD players. It dashes my comprehension nearly to pieces how dumb (...) some people online can be. Anyone complaining about the trailers, I suppose, were too busy rushing to their PCs to complain about it on Amazon to be botherd to look at their DVD remotes and find the ""SCAN"" button. I hit the commercials, scanned forward and in two seconds was watching the film.

I've watched my Shrek 2 DVD twice now, and not once did I have to sit through the trailers at the beginning. But I seem to be a rare case here. I actually know how my DVD player works beyond ""Play"", ""Stop"", ""Pause"" and ""Chapter Skip"". Any decent DVD player is capable of scanning through that crap in a matter of seconds; and the Shrek 2 DVD is no exception.

Get any recent DVD put out by Universal and you'll run into the same thing. They are hyping their new movies and home movie releases at the start of the disc, and they DO set it so you can't skip but anyone can scan if they use their common sense. Why are people here pissing on as if this is the only DVD that places previews at the beginning of the disc? I have six or even seven other DVDs not released by Dreamworks that does the same thing. For all you whiners, here's a tip: Look for the ""scan"" button on your remotes and get ready to feel kinda dumb.

The disc could be better, the specials could be, the menu could be, yeah, yeah, yeah. That may be true enough, but don't allow that to ruin a great movie. You don't have to take my word for it, and please, please, please do not allow yourself to be influenced by nit-picking, opinionated people on Amazon. Rent this disc before you buy, and do decide for yourself how bad the dvd is. For my part, it played the movie, it looked great, sounded just fine. What's the problem?

Shrek 2 was so hyped when it was released to theaters, I think Dreamworks blew their wad on hyping this film perhaps they didn't have the budget to make a better DVD. That much hype usually communicates to me that a movie is going to be bad and they are plastering it everywhere to desperately fill theaters. Remember how they hyped Cat in the Hat (ewww)? Anyway, that's why I ignored the theater run of Shrek 2.

I was told it was better than the first one by people I trust, so when the disc came out I snatched it up, and I have no regrets. I'm glad I did. I just don't care about DVD extras.. I have the extended editions of Lord of the Rings; Fellowship, and The Two Towers and I've only watched the movies. The discs of behind-the-scenes stuff has never been played. I just don't care; but that's me so like I said, rent Shrek 2 on DVD first. But don't pass it up just because some whining, impudent internet gorks can't figure out how to use thier DVD players.

As for the movie itself, I found it not just better than the first one, but WAY better. Great characters all around, hilarious comedy-The take a few goofs on Disney but I see them goofing on other films like LOTR, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spiderman and so-on.  I especially loved it when Shrek and Donkey were arrested `ala ""Cops"" and the policeman was shaking pepper into Shrek's eyes with a grinder (like pepper spray). I nearly died laughing.

I loved the movie and I have no complaints about the disc itself.  (...)",1099958400,5,3616,4.329394387001477

I agree with all the previous complaints.

1 Disc, as compared to most major budget kids movies being released with an entire extra disc of features.

Movie Previews, that they actually LOCK YOUR KEYPAD so you are forced to watch everytime you put the dvd in.  This I find SO insulting.  I paid good money for this dvd.  It shouldn't be like this.

The release of this dvd is even so cheap, there isn't even an INSERT inside the dvd case.  The total presentation of this DVD is so shoddy and pathetic.  I really wish I could take it back, but sadly most places I know have a firm policy that you cant return dvds, only trade them for the same title.  Sad. Because this DVD is a total rip off.

No, I came to find out if this DVD is really as crappy as my experience has told me.  After reading a half-dozen reviews, I'd have to say yea.  It seams most DVD players won't let you skip the commercials for ""Shark Tale"" and ""Madagascar"".  However, when played on my computer, I was able to skip right to the menu.  Perhaps some tech-head out there could explain why this is, to us ""lame-o"" consumers.

Another couple of things to be aware of:

-The sound, though Dolby 5.1, is really flat sounding.  I don't have a great DVD system, but the difference between ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" is noticable.  (NO THX Here).  I had to crank it up to get that ""theater feal"".

-At first glance, the extras appear plentiful, but also come up flat.  It seams that the producer of this disk were all about appearances and not about content.  The games are for those with brain damage (so symplistic) or those who like being quizzed to be sure they watched the entire film.  The ""juke box"" simply takes you to a musical part of the film...  ...then keeps going.  If you want another song, go through the menu again.

-Not even a one page insert.  NOTHING!!  For a film they keep bragging about as the #1 comedy of all time, I'd expect, at least, a folded insert, and at most a little booklet.

I wish I could return this, but now I'm stuck.  If I had known how ""cheap"" this disk really is, I would have waited for the 2 disc, special edition (which I will not buy until this disk is worn out).

1490185,5,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"", the sequel to the computer-animated twisted fairy tale, delivers the full promise of what a sequel should be.

While every bit as funny as the first movie, it did lose of measure of quirkiness from the original because you know and understand most of the character now. Two new characters also deliver new charm to the story: the Fairy Godmother and Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas.

Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon and are summoned to her parents' castle in the kingdom of Far Far Away. Well, the king and queen aren't expecting their daughter and son-in-law to be ogres. The king, (voiced by John Cleese, who seemed to be begging for a part in this movie), hires Puss in Boots to take care of the ogre. But the cat screws up his mission and joins up with Shrek instead, initially to the chagrin of Donkey.

Together they break into the Fairy Godmothers potion factory and steal a vial of ""Happily Ever After"" juice. Shrek and Donkey take the juice and change into attractive beings, as does Fiona. However, things don't work out exactly as planned.

1490187,2,B00005JMQZ,"After waiting for months for the DVD to be released, I finally got it. It pails in comparesion to the first Shrek DVD.

The movie is still good. Hence the two stars. It's a great fairytale, lots of laughs and impressive drawing and sceneries.

But the ONE DVD (so used to an additional DVD with extras and lots of details) looks like sub-par work. It's clearly mainly there for merchendising - not for us collectors.

1) The DVD locks the first 5-10 minutes with previews. For this ONE reason I'm returning the disk. I do not wish to own nor pay to watch commercials. This might be ok for rentals (I usually return them too if I cannot skip it) but not for collector buy DVDs.

2) The main menu is 9 little pictures. The original DVD had donkey jumping around, sound bites and funny things going on, nomatter what page you were on. That's all gone.

3) The Tech of Shrek is a promotional video for Dreamworks. There's NOTHING that goes behind how they did any scene or the general process of going from idea to the final rendering. The ""tech"" is the use of a few buzz-words.

4) The ""goofs"" are not commented. It would be nice to know what happend, and why this particular error is funny. Some of them are just not funny in my oppinion.

5) The Kid section is for larger kids. Be ware!  No 8 year old is going to be able to ""save fiona"" as she'll have to read at a 5th grade level to be able to understand and comprehend.

6) The juke-box is really badly implemented. You basicly just index into a given bookmark on the DVD, and have to push menu to get back to the jukebox. If you don't, the movie just continues as normal.

7) Where's the interviews or other funny stuff that in #1 made kids really like the characters?

In general not even close to the experience we were given with the original DVDs.  The shrek2.com is much better though. If you have kids, let them play around there - it's going to give them more fun than anything on the DVD.

Dreamworks - I'm very disappointed.",1099785600,21,1986,4.306451612903226
1490188,2,B00005JMQZ,"After watching the dvd and reading other peoples reviews here online, I agree. The marketing Dreamworks has done is absolutely HORRIBLE to do to their paying customers. They should just be thankful we already bought one item of theirs and just let us watch that. Instead, they make us sit through LONG previews that after the first time, we're never going to want to watch again. Shame on you dreamworks.

In addition, to that, it is somewhat upsetting that instead of a normal Tuesday release, their marketing at Dreamworks desided to push it off for Friday... a day when Pixar released their next masterpiece to theaters. Is that a marketing scam? I would say so. Dreamworks undoubtably was trying to take customers away from the first day release of ""The Incredibles"" to stay home and watch their previews instead. Dreamworks is obviously all about $$$.

Another, kind of marketing related, issue I have is that my dvd did not come with a chapter selection pamphlet on the inside. Hello Dreamworks! The first Shrek had TWO discs and practically a book pamphlet in that case, and now Shrek 2 only has ONE disc with no pamphlet? Surely those inserts couldn't cost too much money... Perhaps it was only my dvd that did not come with a pamphlet...but I don't think so, because I did exchange it for another one, and no pamphlet.

The movie itself is ok. Now however, I am beginning to realize that there is very little plot that makes up the movie. Instead, it is a small plot that could be resolved in a matter of minutes filled with an hour of making fun of other more notable and original works, such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" both from Disney.

Shrek and Shrek 2 were ok, but I think after a while, the oher infinite Shreks will soon turn into those Land Before Times...they just never end and ruin the original.

Before all of you who simply loved Shrek 2 put down that this review was not helpful, just stop and think. I am not putting down the movie, so much, but rather the dvd.

Going in to Shrek, we'd read only a couple reviews, or listened to friends' commentaries of it.  Once in the theater, we were surprised by the witty comedy.  Going into Shrek 2, we expected the writers to follow suit.  We were expecting parodies of fairy tales, we were expecting Pinocchio to tell a lie about some thing, we were expecting Gingi to be sad again over the gumdrop buttons.

As far as the previews at the beginning of the DVD--my player skipped right over them.  I had to go back to know they were even there.  Sitting through previews is annoying, but remember the days of VCR-dom, when we had to fast forward through all of those?

In reference to the original ending with the dragon returning... it *IS* there.  Just be patient enough to sit through some of the credits, or just fast forward to that part.

Also, Shrek 2 has its humorous moments, but the plot reminds me of day-time soap opera.  Not that the plot is bad...I just don't think it was as great as others rate it.  The fairy godmother (Disney) parody was overdone and not that original either.  Shrek 1, IMHO, is still the best.  As with the first Shrek, this movie's humor and theme are not really for kids.

Shrek 2 was a different experience.  Outrageously funny throughout, I am probably looking forward to the DVD release more than my kids are, and they saw the film several times.

Shrek 2 has a story that pulls you through the film, and plenty of laugh lines.  What makes the film so good, however, is the visual take-offs on other films and things the parents will recognize instantly, including many from, the um, that other family-oriented animated film company.

The addition of Antonio Banderas gives a boost to the film as, and Myers and Murphy are both very funny once again.

Shrek 2 may actually be funnier on DVD than it was in the theatres.  There were quite a few scenes where visual references went by so fast I am sure I missed some of the humor.  The DVD will let us pause and rewind to make sure we miss nothing.",1099180800,10,937,4.406976744186046

IMO Shrek 2 edges it in visuals and production value, and trounces it in terms of soundtrack, story, characters, humour and dialogue. The wit is on an adult level while keeping a childish verve and innocence. I have never come across this before in animated feature films.

Myers, Murphy and Saunders are brilliant. The visuals are wonderful. Bravo Dreamworks!",1099008000,11,527,5.116279069767442

1490349,5,B00005JMQZ,"""Shrek 2"" is a hilarious animated film sequel released in 2004 starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz.  The original edition, released in 2001, was nominated for five Oscars and won one for Best Animated Feature.  This time, the plot has much more funny wit, it has more interesting action, and its has more suspense.  Few sequels have the capacity to match or surpass the quality of their original.  This film does.  Through the one-of-a-kind film theme to the acting to the amazing animation graphics, it remains interesting through every scene.

Through Shrek's journey to impress his wife Fiona, he encounters many difficult obstacles.  Whether they contain action or emotion, the plot stays on top.  The unexpected humorous lines give this journey the unique viewing pleasure.  The characters that Shrek meets have their own unforgettable persona: Pinnochio, Gingerbread Man, Fairy Godmother, and many others.  Despite placing many characters from other fairy tales into this film, it remains a film of its own.  The writers take those original stories and give it a hilarious take.  The marvelous acting gives this plot the additional interesting experience, namely Myers, Murphy, and Diaz.

""Shrek 2"" is a great film for all ages to enjoy.  This is sure to continue pleasing its audiences for many years.  Expect this film to receive a few Oscar nominations including Best Animated Feature, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, and possibly others.",1098057600,6,1469,5.244635193133047

The jokes of the movie reaches two parallels: one for kids and one for adults.  I laughed through the whole movie.  I knew it was going to be a great movie because the first one was so funny.

1490393,4,B00005JMQZ,"The First Shrek was one of the most coolest and funniest animated film what I had ever seen. Especially, It was made for adult audience because it had many jokes that kids would not undersand at all. I liked also characters which was created were well visually and personal way. The events which were taken for Matrix and another movies were carefully added.

 Shrek 2 has many same elements than first Shrek. Fiona  ( lovely Cameron Diaz) and Shrek ( terrific Mike Myers) has been married some time ago and now it's time to go wedding trip to Fiona's parents castle. Donkey ( funny man Eddie Murphy) wants also travel with wedding couple but Shrek doesn't like that idea.

 Donkey is as irritating as first movie but someway it. Maybe because I am sometimes very a irritating person.

 There are many good characters for xemple. Prince Charming who use cherry lips shine and Puss-In-Boots(astonishing Antoni Banderas) who can uses its sweet and innocent eyes to give a wrong grasp itself. Puss-In-Boots is a real cat warrior!

 Shrek 2 takes many shots from The Lord of The Rings trilogys which are carefully added.

 In my opinion, Shrek 2 is not so good than first Shrek because there are less musical sections and plot is not as good as first movie

 All in all, Shrek 2 is funny, emotinal and good adult's fairy tale. Highly recommanded for people who likes to laugh.",1097193600,3,1372,4.666666666666667

1490395,5,B00005JMQZ,"Still not for kids, still hilarious; but this time around they've perfected the formula.  The first film was surprising, and refreshing to say the least.  Most of the humor seemed spontaneous and immediate, and relied heavily on lambasting certain canonical fairy-tale mainstays, all with the joyousness of Monty Python.  Shrek 2 takes a slight step back from that, and instead ops to carry on with the modus operandi of how the characters interact with their own world.

The plot picks up from the honeymoon; Shrek and Fiona come back to find Donkey fully ensconced in their home.  Before long they've been invited home by Fiona's parents so that they can meet her husband, Prince Charming, whom she was supposed to marry.  It all goes fabulously awry when the King (voiced by the funniest man alive, John Cleese) decides that he's going to right this fairy-tale wrong.  After a stern warning from the evil Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders of ""Absolutely Fabulous"") that her son Prince Charming had better end up with Fiona, he decides to visit the local pub (Larry King is voicing the bar-maid), and procures the help of Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas in a mock Zorro performance).

Things don't go as planned; Puss decides he's better off serving Shrek rather than the King, and they all decide to go see the Fairy Godmother to try and get things working for Shrek again.  However, she's woefully indifferent to his cause because after all, he took her son's place!  They do manage to steal a magic potion that turns Shrek into a man, ""thick, wavy locks?  Taut, firm buttocks?""  It also turns Fiona into her Diaz-looking form again, and Donkey into a noble steed, ""But now, we're sexy!""

If the plot seems to move awkwardly forward at first, it's only because of the massively confident payoff in the end.  This isn't to say the beginning isn't funny; it is.  The whole movie is hilarious, and the ending is one grain of salt after the next.  There's also the submerged comedy you have to work a little bit for.  Shrek's line; ""join the club, we've got jackets.""  There's a bit with Fairy Godmother writhing on a piano while singing ""I Need a Hero.""  King's line; ""Just the old Crusade wound acting up a bit.""  Notice too how Prince Charming is sitting while eating his Medieval-meal.

The best line is, of course, Puss's protest that the bag of catnip in his pocket is ""uh... not mine.""  Although there's a better line before that as Puss calls the knights, ""You Capitalist pig-dogs!""

I would have to say, on the whole, it's a much more complete movie than the first, and it takes many more risks at the expense of going too far.  However, the movie never crosses the corny line, and delivers every punch-line.  Definitely get this one.",1097020800,3,2754,4.747368421052632

Shrek and friends return in this sequel to the 2001 animated movie from Dreamworks. This is thier first sequel, and I hope they don't start releasing squels after squels, like thier emeny Disney does, even though Disney has been around for a lot of decades, and Dreamworks has been around since the 1990's. As the movie opens, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has arrived at the castle that Princess Fiona used to live, but he doesn't know that she had already ben found and rescured, and thinks that Fiona is stilling in the tower. That is, in til he goes into the tower, to discover the wolf, whom he has afaird is Princess Fiona, and tells him, that she is on her honeymoon, which leads him to ask ""with whom""? Which leads to Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Camera Diaz) returning from thier honeymoon, and they find Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is ready and waiting from them, at Shrek's house. And when they finnaly get some time alone, a messager arrives at the door with an invition from Fiona's mother (Julie Andrews) and father (John Cleese) invition them to thier kindom in far far away, to a ball and dinner to celbrate thier marriage. But what they don't know is, that Fiona has married an orge, and now is one herself, and they believe she has married Prince Charming, whom is also the son of the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), but just wait to see how they react to this news. At first, Shrek doesn't want to go and doesn't think it is a good idea. But they do go anway, and when they finnaly arrive in the kindom, the queen and King are not happy to see that Fiona has married an orge, or at least her father is, and he hires the Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas from the Spy Kids movies) to kill Shrek, but instead they become friends, and when Shrek thinks that Fiona is not happy, he sets out to find the Fairy Godmother to try to get her help.

1490397,2,B00005JMQZ,"I have no clue why people like this film. If you want a good animated film or something, buy Aladdin since that's coming out in a month or so. I'm serious, this movie is just not good.",1096329600,,184,4.0
1490398,2,B00005JMQZ,"Now I'd just like to say that I LOVED the first Shrek movie.  It was brilliant as a story, as a movie, and as parody of fairy tales.  It's probably one of my favourite computer-animated films of all time.
This film, despite all of the hype about it, in my opinion falls into the ""cash-in-sequel"" category.  The story is promising; Shrek and Princess Fiona get an official message from her mother and father, who believe her to have married Prince Charming (who we find out comes to the castle after Shrek does to rescue her, only to find that his princess has already been rescued by an Ogre).  The first meeting between the ogres and the people of ""far, far away"" where Fiona's parents live predictably goes awry, but the fairy god mother (the mother of Prince Charming) is determined to put Shrek out of the picture for good so that her narcissistic son can marry Fiona as was the original plan.
The problem with the film isn't with the new characters, which are actually pretty interesting and amusing (although Puss in Boots didn't make sense for me as a character... Shrek is his sworn enemy, and suddenly he begins to help him?), but with all of the old ones.  They are simply not put to any good use in this film.  Shreck and Fiona are uninteresting simply because they don't have any dramatic flaws; they're completely PERFECT and always do the right thing. The little personality flaws that made them interesting in the previous movie are gone here, leaving behind only boring characters that are simply not funny. Donkey doesn't even have a legitimate reason to be in the movie; he just sort-of follows Shrek around the film and makes his usual wise-ass (pun intended) remarks. The Gingerbread man and other friends of Shrek also somehow manage to make their way into the film, although it is unexplained exactly how they managed to travel to the land of ""far, far away"" in less than a day when it took Shrek and Fiona many months to get there.
It all just feels too artificial for me. The original Shrek, while being a great comedy, also made sense as a story. Shrek 2 just feels as if the story was cooked up as a reason for the jokes to happen. The ""feel-good"" ending didn't make sense to me either; I won't give it away, but I couldn't help but think that there is no possible way that Fiona's parents should have been as happy with it as they were.
All said, this is a real publicity-type, give-the-audience-what-they-want type of movie, complete with a  cheesy ending that shamelessly rips off the ending to the original Shrek.  It apparently worked, because the audiences and critics loved it.  I'll bet you, however, that a lot of them are now thinking back on the movie and realizing that it wasn't as good as they originally thought it was (much like Star Wars: Episode 2 is now considered to be a bad movie now that people have had time to reflect on it and realize what a horrible script it had).",1095984000,8,2918,4.542857142857143

This is most definitely not your typical animated movie. Instead of doing the typical thing of the occasional cutesy song peppered through the movie, it went out of its way to keep the viewer laughing as long and as hard as possible. Every minute is another side splitting joke or parody. Shrek 2 had me laughing more than any other movie I've ever seen in my life.

Parodies? Oh yes. I wouldn't be surprised if Shrek 2 set a new record for number of television shows and movies to be parodied in a single work. Some of them are obvious, but some are subtle and hard to spot. This is the greatest part of the movie. The parodies aren't just funny haha, they're funny up the wall and across the ceiling.

1490454,1,B00005JMQZ,"I'm sure I'll be vilified for this, as I was for my review of the original Shrek, but here goes: Shrek 2 is the cinematic equivalent of eating a Twinkie. Sure, it may taste kind of good initially, but it leaves an aftertaste that's not quite right, and in the end you know it's done you more harm than good.

I won't summarize the plot or characters here, because the other reviewers here do that very well, and also because the plot and characters are something you've seen a hundred times before in far better movies. Instead, I'll tell you whether I thought the movie was good or bad, and why.

If all you're looking for is a mildly pleasant, unchallenging way to kill a couple of hours, you'll love Shrek 2, or the ""original"" (for lack of a better word) Shrek. But to me, Shrek represents everything that's wrong with America today. People don't want originality, they don't want ""real"" humor, they don't want a movie with heart or depth, they don't want a movie that tries to say something. People want to be told what to like; they want to walk into a movie theater and see exactly what they expected to see, from the hackneyed story to the would-have-been-so-cool-in-1977 characters to the painfully ankle-grabbing, politically correct ending.

But the unoriginality of Shrek 2 isn't what annoys me. Most movies are derivative and unoriginal. What gets me is how smug Shrek 2 is in its trite, wannabe-cool, faux-""attitude."" There isn't a single second of this movie that I haven't seen before elsewhere. To sum it up: Shrek 2 is a PRODUCT, not a movie. The plot, script, and characters could have been (and might have been, for all I know) produced by a computer that watched a bunch of kids' movies, chewed them all up, and spit them out once all the flavor was gone.

If you're a Simpsons fan (as I am), the Shrek movies are the equivalent of Poochy. I can picture right now the corporate boardroom where Shrek and Shrek 2 were dreamed up: ""No no no! He needs more attitude! ATTITUDE!"" ""He should be a surfer!"" ""Rasta-fy him by 10 percent or so!"" ""Don't forget to mock Disney some more!""

Clearly, if there weren't so much hype and groveling, boot-licking admiration for this tired retread of warmed-over cliches calling itself a movie, I might not despise it as I do. The one bright spot in this morass is Antonio Banderas as Puss-In-Boots. Banderas' natural energy and charm make his scenes watchable; he's not dragged down by the material surrounding him.

I'm sure many of you just can't wait for Shreks 3, 4, and 5. Please don't get mad at me for telling you their plots and endings right now: Fiona is going to be somehow transformed into her lovely, Cameron Diaz counterpart at the beginning of each sequel. She will spend most of each sequel looking and acting cute and desirable (or you wouldn't be in the theater watching her), and at the end of each sequel she'll be transformed back into her fat-and-ugly-but-happy true self (please translate that ""fat-and-ugly"" comment I just made into the latest politically correct term. Just like the Shrek movies, I'd hate to offend you!)

Now, don't get mad at me for revealing these future plot twists. I'm sure you'll love the sequels anyway.",1094688000,13,3205,4.661946902654868

Shrek and Fiona, just married, return from the honeymoon, and they are back in the swamp.

The original film's humor exchanged between the annoying talking animal and the green ogre is still there, but not as much as before, because the sequel gives particular care to new characters, mostly, musketeer-like 'Puss-in-Boots' and The Fairy Godmother, voiced by Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders respectively.  Their humor, especially the latter  one, belongs to the more wicked type, like Glenn Close's Cruella Deville in '101.'

Plus you see Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) who is after Fiona's love, and Fiona's parents King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lilian (Julie Andrews), all less impressive additions to the story.  And I don't know why, but they added another character voiced by Larry King, who appears in the last place you expect him to be.  So many characters clutter, as you see now, and the original three characters are given less chance to imppress us on the screen.

The story gives enough surprises, but not as surprising as the original's, and the gags (so many to write down here) are interesting (if you can notice), but their reference look often too easy (parodies of 'Spider-man' or 'LOTR,' or instance) and the gags are less edgy than those in the first 'Shrek' which showed a deliciously wicked satire on some all-too-clean theme parks (or the House of Mouse).  Can we still be laughing with a joke based on someone named 'Justine' in 2014 ?  I don't think so.

I love the film all in all, and it's often very funny, but the fresh and wry humor found in the first one cannot be found here.  Good sequel, but as to the success as sequel, not as good and innovative as that of 'Toy Story 2.'",1093305600,,2283,4.785714285714286
1490507,5,B00005JMQZ,"I saw this movie the day it came out in theaters and it was awesome. By far the best Shrek movie, this film had everything. It built on characters we already knew and made them better. As for the new characters, they were great. John Cleese was wonderful as the king and Julie Andrews made a perfect queen. Larry King lent his voice to the Ugly Stepsister. But Antonio Banderas' Puss N Boots by far stole the show. And the byplay between Puss and Donkey is fantastic. I intend to buy this movie as soon as it is released.",1092787200,,521,4.2727272727272725
1490508,5,B00005JMQZ,"All right I'll admit I love Antonio Banderas to begin with but who knew that anyone could make a cartoon charecter somewhat 'sexy'??? (I think Angelina Jolie might come in a close 2nd for this one in Shark Tale). Puss in Boots is the most hillarious charecter ever created, and the fact that he's got a Zorro Complex just completley add to it. There's a striking similarity between the puss fight scene in the Castle and Zorro's fight scence in the hacienda (Mask of Zorro) down to the music.

  Donkey is absolutley hilarious and actually puss is a great charecter for him to play off of. I thought I was going to die when he's in the carriage with Fiona and Shrek.

  Fairy Godmother and Charming are great additions too. Fairy godmother is deffinatley hillarious, espically when she sings ""HOlding out for A Hero"".

  All the other great charecters from the original appear again including the Ginerbread man, 3 blind mice, the Muffin man and who can forget Pinnochio, who steals a few scenes in this movie. Dragon makes a nice apperabce too during the credits.

  Other new additions in this one include Mongo (the giant Ginerbread man), Fiona's parents, The ugly Step-sister and Joan Rivers.

  The movie also spoofs LA quite nicely mainly Rodeo Drive which now includes stores like Versarchery, Farbucks, Friar Fat boy, & Abercrombie and Witch. I personally love when the farbucks get destroyed all the customers just run across the street into another farbucks...LOL

  The Music in the movie was amazing. Everything from Counting Crows ""Accidentally in Love"" to Puss in Boots and Donkey's Livin' La Vida Loca is perfectly fit in to the movie and animated very well.

  Shrek 2 is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The voice casting in it is amazing and the animation fabulous. Teenagers and adults will actually probably like it more than small kids (it's filled with inuendo). In fact the first time I saw it was with 6 other teens (14-21 years old) and we never stopped laughing. I can honestly say I laughed just as hard the 4th time I saw it!!!!!!!!!

1490555,3,B00005JMQZ,"I am amongst the incredibly few people who were not charmed by this sequel to the 2001 smash hit ""Shrek"".  I absolutely love the original, don't get me wrong, but ""Shrek 2"" simply does not measure up.  Nothing has really changed in the sequel; the animation is better, if anything and Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy all return to reprise their roles as Shrek, Princess Fiona, and Donkey.

Yet the chemistry and witty banter amongst the three of them feels repetitive and flat.  The novelty of the satirical references to Disney characters and other cultural icons (Starbucks is re-imagined as Farbucks by the filmmakers and Joan Rivers makes an animated appearance on the red carpet) that worked so well in the first one diminishes drastically here.  In addition, the humor wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as in the original.  During the showing that I attended, I could count on one hand the number of times the audience broke into laughter.  I think we all felt like we were watching the same thing for a second time.  There was nothing new or fresh to distinguish ""Shrek 2"" from its predecessor and we are therefore left with nothing to reflect favorably upon.  With the first film, my family and I would often repeat the jokes or reenact some of the funnier moments.  With this film, I honestly can't think of one funny instance to mention.

The spark and wit that made ""Shrek"" such a fantastic film that can be watched again and again just isn't present in the sequel.  ""Shrek 2"" is by no means a ""bad"" film; it does have its few moments of true comic genius, but it just does not measure up to the original and I found myself horribly disappointed because of that.  I spent most of the movie waiting for it all to ""click"" and become what the original was, but by the time the credits began to role, I realized that wasn't to be.",1092441600,12,1845,4.571428571428571
1490556,5,B00005JMQZ,"Unless it's part of a trilogy, very seldom does a sequel come along that surpasses the original film. I realize there are some who will disagree, but in my opinion SHREK 2 is a far better film than SHREK. SHREK is memorable for several things, but is usually most noted for the way it turned the classical fairy tale upside down (and made fun of Disney along the way). SHREK was a huge risk for Dreamworks because it would be the film that would either make or break their fledging CGI animation department.  However, unlike SHREK, the filmmakers of SHREK 2 didn't have as much pressure. The CGI animation at Dreamworks is second only to Pixar and the personal axe that some of Dreamworks executives had to grind with Disney has already been done. Therefore, the filmmakers and writers were able to focus more on character development, writing, and expanding the universe they created in the original movie.

The plot of the movie is rather simple. Shrek and Fiona return home from their honeymoon to find a housesitting Donkey grappling with his relationship with Dragon. The three are invited to the kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents. When they finally meet Fiona's parents, both parents are somewhat taken back by Fiona's appearance and her father immediately takes a dislike to Shrek. Unbeknownst to anyone, Fiona's father has made a deal with Fairy Godmother that her son Prince Charming was supposed to be the man to marry Fiona. Trouble brews. An ogre assassin named Puss in Boots is dispatched to get rid of Shrek and things get even more interesting from there.

SHREK 2 isn't filled with as many pop cultural references as the first movie and I found it to be more enjoyable because of that. Don't be mistaken because the movie has a lot of pop culture references but they aren't as frequent as they were in the first movie:  instead of a movie or television reference every 20 seconds, the film focuses more on character development than anything else. We learn more about Fiona and her life growing up. We find out about Donkey and his relationship with Dragon. We get to see how much Shrek really loves Fiona. In addition, many secondary characters from the first movie (Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Blind Mice, the Big Bad Wolf) have larger roles which are crucial to the plot. Then there are a few new characters (Puss in Boots, Fairy Godmother, Mongo, etc.) which make the world in which Shrek lives a much more interesting and lively place.

Also, SHREK 2 doesn't contain as many vulgar jokes and sexual innuendos as SHREK does. There are a few, but not many. Therefore, SHREK 2 is more family friendly than SHREK.

Overall, I found SHREK 2 to be an excellent film. The climatic last 15 minutes of the film was quite exciting. It was like watching an action film from yesteryear. It's a postmodern anti-fairy-tale fairy tale worth watching.",1092182400,8,2880,4.738522954091817

1490558,4,B00005JMQZ,"In the 1980s and in the 1990s, the sequels used to be a terrible follow-up to a successful movie. Thankfully in recent years, Hollywood's biggest franchises have sequels as good or even better than the originals. ""The Lord Of The Rings"" was getting better every year, in ""Harry Potter"" each movie is better than the predecessor, ""Spider-Man 2"" is better than ""Spider-Man"", ""X-Men 2"" is better than ""X-Men"", and to be honest, ""Shrek 2"" is an improvement over the original ""Shrek"".

 The most important characters are back, and the additions to the roster are impressive and funny: Fiona's parents, Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese) are funny and believable, the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) is much more dangerous than Lord Farquaad, and the delicate Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is very funny. But the character that steals every scene is the furry Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), Puss is funny, cute, and as complex as the real cats. Banderas did an outstanding work in ""Shrek 2"".

 The original cast is as efficient as in the first movie: Shrek (Mike Myers) is the hero of the movie, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is lovable and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is one of the best sidekicks in a movie.

 ""Shrek 2"" is packed with satire, funny jokes, spoofs, lovable characters, hilarious characters, good music, smart dialogues and much more. The animation is more fluid, the characters are more detailed, and the backgrounds are richer and believable. ""Shrek 2"" is better than the first movie, and it's also one of the best animated films of all time. Can't wait for the DVD release.",1091750400,7,1615,4.962962962962963
1490559,2,B00005JMQZ,"Quite possibly one of the most over rated films of the summer. Is it me or does any CGI childrens film just get great reviews for being just that? Throw in a few pop culture references and all of a suddent its the funniest movie of the summer?  I don't think so. This film merely reverses the story of the first film, boring its audience with re-treading the same themes and ideas. Puss n Boots(a one note gag) tags along, for seamingly no reason whatsoever. This movie just rolls along, with obvious jokes, and over sentimentality. Its the kind of movie that's easy to love, but when you think about it later, it really was just too easy for the film makers. Could they not have injected an ounce of real heart or plot into this sequel? The modern music is put in for laughs, and fails miserably. This is the laziest film and critics should have been more critical of it, instead it gets an easy pass for all of its mistakes simply because it had 'adult' jokes. Mission Impossible was years ago, was that the best they could do? There pop reference jokes aren't even up to date. Yes Starbucks is on every corner, we get it. Welcome to three years ago.

Terrible sequel. Some people are far too easily ammused.",1091491200,9,1210,4.42152466367713
1490560,5,B00005JMQZ,"I couldn't help it - I loved this sequel to Dreamwork's 2000 hit movie ""Shrek"" and can't wait till I can own it on DVD for myself. With beautiful visuals, hilarious gags, wonderful characters and the continuing satire on modern-day references and fairytale cliches, ""Shrek 2"" is one of the best movies I've seen this year.

 It begins directly after the happy ending of the original in which Shrek rescued the Princess Fiona, first from a fire-breathing dragon and then from the much more dangerous adversary: Lord Farquaad who was out to marry Fiona himself. Sadly John Lithgow didn't return for this sequel (he was one of the funniest parts of the original) but the movie compensates well. Enjoying their honeymoon, Fiona and Shrek rush through several movie send-ups including ""Spiderman"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", but quickly get onto the real story.

 After hearing of their daughter's marriage, Fiona's parents King Harold and Queen Lillian invite Shrek and Fiona to their kingdom of Far Far Away in order to celebrate at a grand ball. Shrek, Fiona and of course Donkey are off to meet in the in-laws. However, Shrek is certainly not the son-in-law that the king and queen expected - in Fiona's childhood Harold made a deal with her fairy godmother (voiced wonderfully by Jennifer Saunders) that she would one day marry her son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett in a funny but slightly under-used performance). None of these three groups are particularly satisfied with each other, with Harold in particular rather fearful about what will happen should Fiona and Charming not get together.

 What's he so afraid of? That's the secret that will be revealed by the end of the movie, but until then, Harold hires a hit-man to kill Shrek and clear the way for Charming. Herein lies the true gem of ""Shrek 2"" - Antonio Banderas as Puss-in-Boots, who gives Donkey a run for his money in terms of sheer hilarity! Whether he's instigating his ""cute-face"", slashing his rapier or coughing up hairballs he is utterly fantastic in every scene he's in.

 Also, are bigger parts for the original's Big Bad Wolf, Pinocchio, Three Blind Mice, Three Little Pigs and Gingerbread Man, whose reaction to the Magic Mirror's ""cop-show"" is priceless! Likewise, the before-mentioned Jennifer Saunders as the fairy-godmother is wonderful, sweet as sugar one moment and then nasty and vicious the next.

 The plot of the movie is paradoxically both predictable and confusing: Shrek and Donkey seemed to do a lot of stomping around the countryside without any clear idea of where they're going or why, and even though he was my favourite character, when I analyse it closely, Puss-in-Boots didn't actually contribute to the continuation of the story. The final act which involved a giant gingerbread man, a Mission-Impossible style rescue, and a gatecrashed party is nothing less than hectic. On the other end of the scale, the smallest child will be able to guess that Harold has a Deep Dark Secret, that he'll hate Shrek and that the Fairy Godmother is a rather spiteful character.

 But none of this gets in the way of what the Shrek franchise is becoming best known for: its play on modern and traditional ways of life. Where the original's Dulop was a clean and sterile version of Disneyland, Far Far Away is a satire of Hollywood, complete with red carpet and Starbucks cafes. On the fairytale side of things, we are treated to guest appearances from Little Red Riding Hood who goes screaming at the sight of the ogre couple, Hansel and Gretal (""What are the crumbs for?"" wonders the befuddled red-carpet presenter) and a wonderful array of fairytale villains at the hangout ""The Poisoned Apple"".

 Best of all, the story ends on an important note: that beauty doesn't buy happiness, a message that is sadly missing from the Hollywood arena. Though Dragon wasn't in the movie as much as I would have hoped, and Monsieur Hood wasn't in it *at all*, I eagerly await the coming of ""Shrek 3"", which at this time is rumoured to be centred around the idea of Shrek vs. the Knights of the Round Table. That premise is already making me smile, and I hope that we see more of Puss, more of Donkey's rather surprising brood of children and more of this delectable brand of humour on the big screens again soon.",1091232000,10,4305,4.839455782312926

Their bliss is interrupted when they receive an invitation to visit Fiona's parents.  Her parents are under the impression that she has married Prince Charming, the man who was supposed to save her from the castle.  When they see Shrek and Fiona, they are surprised, to say the least.  Predictably, Shrek and Fiona's father don't get along very well.  Shrek leaves the castle in a huff.  Fiona's father starts scheming with the Fairy Godmother who is Prince Charming's mother.

Shrek 2 has some really funny scenes of the couple's newlywed life which are played with the opening credits.  After this, the story slows down a bit as the story is set up.  Toward the end, it really picks up, and the finale is a blast.  If you enjoyed Shrek 1, you'll definitely love this.

1490604,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is an extraordinary well-made sequel to the first film as it smoothly transitions from where the first film left off.  The ogre Shrek (Mike Myers's voice) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz's voice) are now married and have returned from a blissful honeymoon where they have pampered each other with love.  Shrek who never before has experienced love is in full force trying to catch up for what he has missed before.  When they return to their love nest in the swamp the pleasure bubble of love suddenly bursts as Princess Fiona's parents insist on having a ball for the newlyweds in the Kingdom of Far Far Away.

Princess Fiona was once human and due to a curse she turned into an hideous ogre by night and a stunning beauty by day.  The curse led Princess Fiona's parents to hide her in a castle guarded by a dragon where only Prince Charming could rescue her.  However, Shrek beat Prince Charming to it and sealed the curse by kissing Princess Fiona, which turned her permanently into an ogre.  This presents some issues for Shrek as he is well aware of how the world looks upon his kind, with an axe in one hand and a torch in the other.  Having this in mind, Shrek refuses to travel and meet Fiona's human in-laws, which leads the married couple into their first argument.  Shrek rapidly learns that he can no longer act the way he once did as it will only sour his relationship with his beloved Fiona, which means that he must begin to listen.

As in the first episode of Shreks adventures the audience is to experience an enlightening and hilarious journey with Shrek and his companion, the talkative and histrionic Donkey (Eddie Murphy's voice).  This time around Shrek faces new challenges as he must confront family issues, stereotypes, mysterious assassins, love quarrels, political issues, and moral dilemmas in the Kingdom of Far Far Away.  All these heavy issues are skillfully balanced with heart-warming and belly-aching comedy, which will enchant a wide range of audiences with its charisma.",1090713600,4,2015,4.758620689655173
1490605,4,B00005JMQZ,"Over in France, the controversial, and increasingly robust, Michael Moore is premiering his latest crap-trap, Fahrenheit 9/11, and judging by the mainly mixed reviews the documentary has received it seems President George W. Bush won?t lost much sleep once this film premieres in the United States. But there is another film that is causing quite a few headaches for another high profile individual, namely Michael Eisner. That film is the highly anticipated, and rigorously promoted, sequel to Academy Award winning animated flick, Shrek. When the original fairy tale parody launched into theaters in 2001, numerous long-standing and highly devoted Disney followers rejected the film outright for its bashing of the company?s fairy-tale feature film characters as well as its theme parks and company?s CEO/Chairman but times have changed, so has the status of the company itself. Now Disney followers are lining up and penning out for the Dreamworks? animated feature to catch the latest inside Disney jabs. Why? How about you ask the 43% of Disney company stockholders who withheld their vote for Michael Eisner. Should Shrek 2 be proven a box office bonanza like the last one, or more so this time, then it would only add more fuel to the fire that Eisner is standing under now.

The story picks up where the last film left off with the hideous ogre discovering the goodness within himself and finding true love at last. You would think they would happily ever after with that whole ordeal of the fire breathing dragon and pompous prince behind them, right? Not so fast! Shrek and Fiona barely cross the threshold when a messenger arrives to announce that the happy couple has been invited to the kingdom of Far, Far Away to attend a celebration hosted by Fiona?s parents, the king and queen. Shrek is reluctant to go believing that once her parents see both of them in their less then flattering forms, they will refuse to give them their blessing but Fiona forces him to go and when they arrive ? What do you know?! Shrek was right! In fact, the king is so upset that he hires a sleazy hit-man, Puss In Boots, to eliminate the caring ogre. And he isn?t the only one after Shrek ? so is the Fairy Godmother who?s son was suppose to marry Fiona before the green one himself got there first. Now Shrek is willing to do anything, even if it means no longer being his old grungy, rude ogre self again, in order to make Fiona happy and live happily ever after. The story for Shrek 2 may seem a tad on the predictable side but the filmmakers throw in the right amount of catchy song-and-dance numbers and fairy-tale wisecracks to more then make up for the innovative story line. It runs at just the right pace and never tends to lag more then a few moments that you?ll want more of the film once it ends.

With the three main voice stars from the original film receiving $10 million paychecks to reprise their roles in the sequel, the film has obviously proven to have a star-studded group of voice-actors but with brand new ones joining in, can the sequel still maintain the edge that it did in the original? One major complaint from the first film was aimed at Mike Myers, who voiced the lovable green ogre, Shrek. It wasn?t Myers? fault exactly or the character, it was just that the work that Myers did in the film wasn?t all that funny compared to either Eddie Murphy or other parts of the film. No one need fear of a repeat in this film as Myers is given a vastly expanded script role in this go-around and delivers numerous comical moments in the film. But the biggest laughs once again come from Eddie Murphy as the likeable, if not often annoying, Donkey. Murphy?s voice-over performance is one of the bigger highlights of the film and he is able to improve on the character slightly to make him funnier then he was in the original film, which hard for any voice-over performer to do. Vast praise is to be given to the other big highlight of the film, Antonio Banderas, who voices Puss In Boots. What could have been a one trick pony, Banderas? voice-over, as well as the humorous situations the character is placed in (?We found catnip? ? ?That?s not mine!?), turn Puss In Boots into another delightful and memorable animated character with quick-witted personality that every child in the audience will enjoy seeing on screen. And Jennifer Saunders is fiendishly villainous as the Fairy Godmother, one you would think would be on the side of justice and right ? But then again, this is Shrek?s world were talking about here! The best sequence comes near the end of the film with her singing ?Holding Out for a Hero? and the comical events that unfold thereafter with all of it timed perfectly.

Overall, Shrek 2 is quite possibly one of the biggest surprises of the summer, if not the year, and is a sight for sore eyes for those vastly disappointed by both Van Helsing and Troy at this point of the summer season. The plot of the film is the most notable problem as it tended to be quite predictable especially as the film went on but, as it was previously stated, the filmmakers present the whole story in such a wonderful and humorous way that it doesn?t seem to matter all that much by the end. Another small problem is the beginning of the film which starts off kind of slow and isn?t as funny as the rest of the film but once things get going (around the scene where Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey travel to Far, Far Away) the feature begins to pick up pretty quickly there after. Though this isn?t a huge recommendation for the film, as one can just as easily go to the music store and listen to it at home, the soundtrack which features several catchy songs, some of which are new versions of old favorites, is a big plus as much as the original film?s was. Shrek 2 is one of the rare gems of the movie world ? a highly touted sequel that actually lives up to the hype that it receives and surpasses even the enormously high expectations set by the original. Another rare feat this film achieves is being enjoyable family feature appropriate for the whole family, an accomplishment that is so rarely achieved outside of the realm of Disney/Pixar fare. There are some suggestive jokes within the film but most will probably fly right over the heads of young children, so it isn?t anything to worry about on the part of the parents. Though it isn?t perfect, Shrek 2 is sure to remain one of the most pleasant family films of the year and for that reason alone it should be one of the must-see films of the season.",1090454400,2,6522,4.586975149957155
1490606,4,B00005JMQZ,"With ""Shrek 2"" not only do you need to know all of your basic fairy tales, but you also have to be up on your popular culture references because everything from ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" to Justin Timberlake is fair came in this successful sequel from Dreamworks that is already in the Top 10 money making movies from all time. So be prepared to keep explaining why you are the only one laughing in the theater because you get the joke that just flashed by which is way over the head of the target audience (which is good because for the most part you do not have to worry about the person sitting in the seat being tall enough to obstruct your view).

 ""Sherk 2"" is not as good as the original, but how many sequels reach that level let alone surpass it (well, if you must know, ""Spider-Man 2""). Part of the problem, if you really want to qualify it as such, would be that the story takes a step backwards before moving forward. Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) go off on their honeymoon and return to find Donkey (Eddie Murphy) taking up residence in their happy home. Then they receive an invitation to visit Fiona's parents, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of Far, Far Away. Shrek knows this is a bad idea, but the disaster is inevitable and off they go.

 Apparently mom and dad do not know that their little girl is now a green ogre and so is the green ogre to whom she is married. Then there is the problem with Prince Charming (Ruppert Everett), who went to the castle to awaken the princess with a kiss only to discover she had already flown the coop. This is a problem because not only is Charming's mother the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) herself, but she had a deal with the King for the two kids to live happily every after and Fiona's marriage to Shrek is not going to stop her.

 In what follows Fiona is reduced to a supporting role in her own life and the new character who becomes more important is Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), who pretty much steals the show (you have got to love those eyes). In fact, if the choice is between ""Shrek 3"" and ""Puss in Boots 1,"" my vote is for the latter at this point. Actually, the more I think about it the Donkey has more to do this time around than Shrek, but it is turning Fiona back into the princess in distress that ultimately undermines this summer of 2004 comedy. The supporting characters are wonderful, but Shrek and Fiona have to be the main focus of any sequel.

 This is not to say this film is not a lot of fun, because it definitely is and if for some reason you only see five films this summer ""Shrek 2"" is one of those five. The under five foot crowd is not going to be concerned with the plot problems and everyone over five feet will be happy about all the jokes they get and their kids do not, so a good time will be had by all.

 Final Note: You do not have to stay for the entire credits but you at least need to make it to the tag sequences that appears a bit of the way into those credits, especially for those who are big fans of Donkey. If you are expecting another music medley, then be forewarned that you are going to be disappointed, but it is still a cute coda.",1090368000,6,3207,4.268533772652389
1490607,5,B00005JMQZ,"This movie is perhaps not as surprising as the first, which is it's only negative.  Those of us who've seen & enjoyed the first Shrek many times (I have the DVD) haven't been surprised by Shrek for a long time anyway!  This movie has more funny stuff than the first, with many new funny characters and, as far as hollywood goes, a unique plot.  OK, the plot is predictable, but it has a few funny twists at the very end, and it's a lot of fun.

I think that this movie is more appropriate for young children than the first.  The first movie showed quite a bit of mean-spirited conversation coming from Shrek, which bothers me.  The second has some references that some parents might find problematic, but the reality is that young children won't pick up on these things that bother only the narrow-minded.",1090281600,2,805,4.517241379310345
1490608,5,B00005JMQZ,"I was actually unsure about Shrek 2 because I was worried they'd ruin the first movie by throwing in irrelevant and painful gags with no real plot, but I was shushed into silence as I watched this hillarious and feel-good film. It's again a mickey-take of all the original fairytales like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Pinochio, and Cinderella, but it's still so funny. Whilst this is for kids, it has some quite, let's say, controversial scenes which could upset young children. The parts where Shrek and Fiona need a little privarcy to make love is quite a scare for three-year-olds. And many people love Puss N Boots fairytale, yet in this they put him on drugs! But still, this is an excellent follow-up to the blockbuster hit Shrek. I would definitely give this one a see, it's just as good as the first one!",1089590400,3,812,4.645833333333333

1490612,3,B00005JMQZ,"After finally getting someone to go with me to see this - does anyone else find it depressing going alone to the cinema? - I can't say I was that impressed. It's OK, but the first one had more magic about it, and having seen the first one a zillion times (no thanks to bratty cousins never having it out the DVD player), I would have gladly never seen Shrek again. Everything's about sequels these days and no doubt the Shrek makers will churn out lots of DVDs, toys, etc, for the parents who will get their little darlings anything their heart desires. (Hands up who wants to throw up)
There are a lot of references to different films in this. And considering the showing that I went to was full of little brats, most of it probably wouldn't even have affected them in any way whatsoever. The Alien reference (in the fight scene with Shrek, Puss in Boots tears out from the chest of Shrek's clothing, in reference to the alien bursting out of Kane's chest in Alien) went straight over my head, so god knows what it would have done to kids whose parents were still babies when this came out! (I have never seen it, don't really want to) Among other references was: Garfield (Puss In Boots, who I'm sorry, IS Garfield, says ""I hate Mondays""); the Giant Gingerbread Man storming the castle is obviously the ""Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man"" from Ghostbusters; the 'P' Puss In Boots marks on the tree is the same as the 'Z' in The Mask Of Zorro; Shrek & Fiona kissing upside down is Spiderman; a Lord of The Rings reference, when Fiona gets a wedding ring; From Here To Eternity gets referenced, when Fiona & Shrek are kissing on the beach, and a wave sweeps over them; the Rocky Horror Picture Show (surprisingly) gets referenced, when the whole family is sitting round the table; and when Pinocchio is rescuing Shrek is Mission: Impossible. Phew!
Obviously being predominantly aimed at the kids, there are a lot of references to nursery rhymes, kids films etc. Many of the characters appear, these being: Captain Hook; Lumiere (the candelabra) and Cogsworth (the clock) from Disney's ""Beauty And The Beast""; The Little Mermaid; Hansel (of the story Hansel and Gretel); Little Red Riding Hood; and Tinkerbell, Peter Pan's little sidekick.
What annoys me most about both movies, is Mike Myer's PITIFUL attempt at a Scottish accent. Hello, no one Scottish talks like that. In my opinion, he sounds horrible, and I definitely wouldn't be going weak at the knees over that accent! Did he even bother to listen to a proper Scottish accent, or did he just think he could get away with it, and no one would notice? I'm sorry, not the case. It annoys me, being Scottish, that's what other countries must think we talk like! The Scottish accent is gorgeous thank you very much.
On a better note, the soundtrack will have you up dirty dancing in the aisles, which such great songs like ""Hold Out For A Hero"" and ""Livin' La Vida Loca"".
The same as the previous movie, there's a bit of film after the credits, which loads of people miss due to walking out at the first sign of credits. The first one had Fiona singing ""Like A Virgin"", and the sequel shows you exactly why the dragon has been so moody! The first time, I missed the bit after the credits, and thankfully, just managed to see it in the second movie - but due to drinking too much, had to make a dash for it!
If you loved the first one (providing you didn't see it too many times), you'll probably love the second one. Just be prepared to put up with lots of little kids at the showing, kicking the back of your chair, yelling, throwing popcorn - bet you were wishing Shrek 2 was 18 rated now, aren't you?",1089072000,3,3648,4.5120845921450154
1490672,3,B00005JMQZ,"The first Shrek had immediately charmed me with its unexpected joy in the vagaries of an ogre's life, and in doing so, sustaining a compelling emotional tenor about how such a repulsive character can ever find true happiness. The resolution to that dilemma was surprising and gratifying.
S2 loses a bit of that lustre by rehashing those pre-sold characters to put over obvious jokes. A couple of new characters may have been good, but we get half a dozen here. There is broad witty banter but nothing I'd remember for over a couple of hours. And when they stopped at a MacDonalds in space, that was it for me.
One saving grace is probably a number of pop culture references. Particularly amusing was the Mission Impossible-inspired rescue of Shrek and company by Pinocchio, the three blind mice, and some assorted fairy tale regulars.
Overall, a mild recommendation. Perhaps a decent rental, but nothing worth raving about.",1088899200,7,923,4.923076923076923
1490673,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is a great film. While it lacks the freshness and novelty of the first one, it still delivers just as much due to the hilarity that ensues throughout this very funny picture, that puts most live action films to shame. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, John Cleese, and Jennifer Saunders all do good jobs, but once again Eddie Murphy steals the show, although this time he has help, as Antonio Banderas's Puss'N'Boots is the best new character in the film, and shares the spotlight with Murphy's Donkey throughout the film, and sometimes overshadows him. This is what summer movies and sequels should be about. Dreamworks deifinitely has a cartoon franchise that rivals anything Disney has put out.",1088899200,3,697,4.915254237288136
1490674,3,B00005JMQZ,"(...)
""Shrek 2"" was the best bet for a potientially great film, (...). It wasnt.
The Good is simple: Antonio Banderas. Puss in Boots was simply a far better character than anything else in the movie, with a side-splitting voice and a fantastic Zorro-esque mood. The best jokes in the film come from him.
Eddie Murphy. He stole the original, but here he doesnt have the same energy, and not enough classic jokes to keeep his motor mouth turning. Despite this he still lands kudos for his ""Pinyata"" speech. As Donkey points out in the movie, ""the postion of annoying talking animal side-kick is taken"". Sadly by Donkey, Puss in Boots is by far a funnier character in this movie.
MOVIE JOKES: Excellent references to films such as ""Spiderman"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Flashdance"", ""Alien"", ""raiders of the Lost Ark"" etc.
MUSIC: Not just as good as the original, but Counting Crowes theme is brilliant.
THE BAD: The plot isn't as razor sharp as the original, the piss take of Hollywood cultire doesnt work as well as the piss take on fairy tales did. Mike Myers has no good jokes as Shrek, who becomes a very 2D character, as does Fiona (Cameron Diaz).
Who got John Cleese cast as the King? Good work!
Who wrote the screenplay giving Cleese NO jokes at all? Get out of making films for Good!
The jokes aren't as well thought out as the original, and seem to fall back on bodily function jokes as opposed to down right killers like the ""Ogres are like Onions"" joke in ""ShreK""
In any case its worth watching for Banderas alone.",1088812800,4,1519,4.5677655677655675

1490679,4,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 takes up where the original left off.  To start the movie Shrek and his lovable bride Fiona are on their honeymoon.  When they return they find Donkey at their swamp house and a rather formal invitation to join Fiona's parents at their kingdom -- ""Far Far Away"".  What Fiona's parents don't know is that Fiona has married an ogre.  Needless to say, her parents are a bit shocked to find that she has married Shrek.  The rest of the plot of the movie entails Fiona's father, the king, as he wrestles with the fact that his daughter is married to an ogre and his machinations with Fairy Godmother...who is the real witch in this movie as she conspires to split Shrek and Fiona so that her son, Prince Charming, may marry the fair princess.
This movie is quite funny.  There are lots of jokes...both for the adults in the audience and the kids.  The animation is quite good, though the words didn't seem to quite fit the movement of the characters' lips.  Overall, this movie is surely worth seeing, as you are virtually guaranteed to laugh at least a bit...and perhaps quite a bit more than that.",1088553600,,1102,4.50251256281407
1490680,3,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2's target audience, unfortunately, doesn't fit my family's profile:  my girls (7 and 3) are too young.  For kids to appreciate Shrek 2 (or even for them not to experience a certain revulsion towards the character Shrek), they need to be older and slightly cynical, at least towards the prototypical Disney ""and they lived happily ever after"" fairy tale movies.  However, even pre-teenage children will only capture a fraction of the references to popular culture and 20 year-old movies that pervade Shrek 2.  Therefore, I submit that the target audience for Shrek 2 is a pair of pop culture saturated parents, and their post-Disney kids.
Since I'm not saturated with pop culture, I didn't get anywhere near all the references in Shrek 2.  But even those that I did get, such as the Stay-Puft marshmallow man of Ghostbusters' fame, and Joan Rivers dishing out her commentary at the Academy Awards, were not exactly side-splitting funny.  Amusing, yes, and Shrek 2 had its moments.  But to me it felt like much of it was formulaic, and aimed at the true pop culture sophisticate.
Pixar, by contrast, has proven repeatedly that they know how to develop funny, warm computer animated movies that truly can be appreciated by all ages. Most all the Pixar films are classics that will still be viewed 20 years from now, whereas by then, Shrek 2 will have faded from memory.",1088380800,4,1373,4.8418803418803416
1490681,3,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is the follow-up to the almighty 'Shrek', a 2002 offering from Warner Bros., and re-teams the vocal talents of Mike Myers as the titular Ogre, along with Cameron Diaz (his lovely bride Princess Fiona), and Eddie Murphy (Donkey).
When Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away, meet Shrek, her Father, disgusted with an Ogre for a son-in-law, is blackmailed by the Fairy Godmother (Absolutely Fabulous' Jennifer Saunders) into having him 'taken care of', so her son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) may have her instead. Enter Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas) who, failing in his task to dispatch our Heroes, joins them instead, and they uncover a dastardly plot full of magical intrigue and mayhem.
The first thing one notices about Shrek 2 (besides the absolutely flawless, magnificent animation, that is) is the slightly darker, more adult theme of the first half of the movie. Here we are dealing with more grown-up themes like love and familial rejection, and unfortunately the comedy value of the movie suffers for it. It's down to Donkey and a couple of nice visual in-jokes (the Kingdom of Far Far Away, the transgendered Ugly Stepsister, the Drive-Thru restaurant) to keep us amused. Sadly, in the wake of the first movie where Shrek himself dealt out a fair share of the jokes, this doesn't work as well as it could have and forced smiles seem to be the order of the day while we wait for something funnier.
It does come - 'Shrek 2' does not disappoint with the hilarious second half of the movie - and the comic talents of Jennifer Saunders and Antonio Banderas are wisely put to very good use, making for a sequel that is, at least in part, as good as the original. The final ballroom scene and parallel battle sequence with Mongo The Giant Gingerbread Man is worth the price of admission alone and the movie does come into its own with more visual and verbal jokes than it's possible to take in.
The animation is superb - it's really getting to the stage where we won't be able to distinguish between CGI and human actors for much longer - check out the human form of Shrek and Princess Fiona's facial expressions for proof of this - and the visual sumptuousness of the movie is an absolute delight.
That said, for a slow beginning and some rather advanced themes (especially for smaller kids), 'Shrek 2' just doesn;t push as many Happy Buttons as the excellent Original. It's good, but it could have been so, so much better.
Maybe for rental, instead.",1088294400,4,2482,4.734411085450346
1490722,4,B00005JMQZ,"I only gave ""Shrek"" three stars because I felt that it was overrated. It wasn't as great a film as everybody said it was. That's why when I sat down to watch ""Shrek 2"" I was expecting the same, if not less, from the first one. I was surprised. ""Shrek 2 was more fun, had more laughs, had more heart, and had better animation from the first one. I liked the story more as well. The first movie had the standard fairy tale story of the hero having to save a princess from a fire breathing dragon. We've seen that before. It is more fun seeing Shrek taking on his own problems than seeing him taking the responsiblites of the problems of others.
The movie takes place right where the first one left off. Shrek is an ogre who saved Princess Fiona from a dragon. At the end of the first one, Fiona transformed into and ogre taking on ""loves true form."" ""Shrek 2"" starts off right after their honeymoon ends. They are summoned to go to the land of Far Far Away to see Fiona's parents King Harold and Queen Lillian. Shrek doesn't want to gom but is convinced by Fiona, and after a long trip with friend Donkey, they make it to the castle. The catch is, Fiona's parents have no idea that their daughter married an ogre, or became and ogre herself. The news comes to a big shock to them, and Harold will have no part in it. The same with Fiona's Fairy Godmother, who wanted her son Charming to rescue Fiona. He made it to the castle to find that the dragon was already dead, and the princess has already been rescued. Harold decides to have Shrek killed by Puss In Boots a Mexican cat that wears. . . boots. A magic potion ends up transforming Shrek into a human, donkey into a stallion, and Fiona back into her human form. The potion says that she will fall in love with the first person she kisses, and she and Shrek will both stay human if they kiss by midnight.
""Shrek 2"" has an orignal story, and it has some great twists and spoofs. Spoofs include a giant Gingerbread man like in ""Ghostbusters"" and a spoof of the television show ""Cops"" with knights. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz do the voice talents like in the first movie, and they make  the characters great. You like these characters, and watching this made me like ""Shrek"" a little better. I would like to see ""Shrek 3.""

1490724,4,B00005JMQZ,"Although I liked the first film, I had doubts about this movie. How much new material can the writers adds to an old storyline? A lot, actually. Shrek 2 turns out to be almost as good as the original Shrek.
This is NOT your typical Disney movie; it has an intelligent sense of humor and an unconventional view regarding love and romance.  Fiona is torn by the apparent lack of welcome from her family. Ogre develops inferiority complex. Talking donkey gets a new rival. Fairy godmother is the evil bitch, and the owner of a magic factory, who is determined to see his son, Prince Charming, married to Princess Fiona.
The main theme of this movie: is attractiveness possible without the physical beauty? Fiona and Orge struggle to find the answer.
Go watch the movie. It's worth the bucks!",1087516800,,788,4.669064748201439
1490725,4,B00005JMQZ,"You probably have seen the first Shrek if you are a kid or if you have kids. Since you probably liked it, you went out to see Shrek 2. Maybe I just had my hopes high but it wasn't as good as many movies.
  The movie starts out with that Prince Charming guy running into the castle, trying to save the princess by breaking her ogre spell. All he gets is the Big Bad Wolf. After that comes one of the most irritating parts of a movie I've ever seen. A song called Accidentally in Love starts and it shows Shrek and the princess on their honeymoon. The song gets screwed in your head and you'll practically be driven crazy by the dumb crazily catchy tune. It doesn't help they started playing it on the radio.
  But that don't matter. What's up ahead is a magical trip to Far Far Away. Princess Fiona and Donkey convince Shrek to go to Fiona's parents for the blessing.
  When you think about it, the plot/storyline is kinda dry. I mean, a 8 year old could have thought of this pretty predictable plot. Face it, you know in basically every movie, there's a bad guy and the bad guy loses in a million different ways. But, you know from the second you set your eyes on Fiona's dad, he's gonna hate Shrek. You know he's gonna do something. You know after Fiona says to the godmother she doesn't need anything, the godmother's gonna get mad and will turn evil. And you know it's gonna end happily ever after.
  Young kids will like the decent humor and the sorta irritating Donkey habits. You'll find everyone in the theater going Auuuhhhhhhh! That's so cute! when the new Puss in Boots (cat with sword) does his 'cute' face. I have to admit that the giant gingerbread man is cool, but other then that the humor is just okay.
  Shrek movies make you basically like most of  the characters. Face it, you can't hate Donkey. All in all, Shrek 2 is a good movie. Unfortunately, the weak storyline and the horrible beginning sequence gives Shrek 2 a pretty good 4 stars.",1087430400,7,1958,4.366391184573002
1490726,4,B00005JMQZ,"One of the things that made the first Shrek movie so great was its originality and unexpected lampooning of other fairy tales/Disney movies.  No sequel could possibly recapture the freshness or originality of this original.
That being said, Shrek 2 thoroughly exceeded my expectations.  The new characters (particularly Puss in Boots) were great, and the old characters maintained their edge (I was particularly worried that the Donkey character would start to wear on my nerves, but he did not).  The story was good, and there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.
All in all, Shrek 2 is nearly as good as the original (sans the novelty).  Highly recommended!",1087344000,,661,5.149532710280374
1490727,3,B00005JMQZ,"So i've been seeing Shrek 2 ads for about a year now. If only the writers had put as much dedication into the product as the marketing people did we might have had a decent film. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original Shrek, but the sequel comes across as a tawdry and superfluous marketing ploy, designed to shift more cute Puss in Boots dolls.
""The plot"" would be overly generous, and if the Shrek 2 people seriously want to applaud themselves for roping in children and adults, they need to offer the adults something more than ""Tower of London records"", which I'm sure Tower records handed over a large wad of cash to see...
On the children/adult debate, i can't really see why a parent would bring a child to see this movie. The plot is too slow to engage a child, and various ""clever"" bits of the script are not subtle enough to evade a child's attention.  Personally i was somewhat offended by the idea of Pinnochio (sp?) wearing a thong, and I'm 24. God knows what a delicate pre-teen might have made of it. Or, in a new low, the business card of the Fairy Godmother that promises ""Happy Endings""? Again not subtle enough to avoid teenagers asking awkward questions about massage parlours.
The animation is outstanding, but the choice of casting really showed up the limitations of CGI vs live action.  I'm thinking right now of John Cleese. His vocal performance in this movie is so incredible and spirited that the animation simply can't keep up, and as such we lose something trying to imagine this hyper-active ranting coming out of such a staid character.  The main highlight of the film is the Puss-in-Boots ""Cute face"" that he pulls twice.  It's the most emotionally attached i've been to a cartoon character since i last saw Jessica Rabbit.
Finally i ask you to cast your mind back to the start of the  film where it takes a long long time to get to Farfaraway?  Now tell me how gingerbread man and the 3 visually challenged mice etc. got there after watching ""knights"" on tv?  The one truly inspired parody in the film was ""Star Wars 2 - Attack of the clones"", although to get it you have to admit to watching Star Wars 2.  I guess the lesson here is DON'T MAKE USELESS SEQUELS TO CLASSIC FILMS, but then we all knew that anyway. Perhaps now the Shrek franchise can rest in peace and live happily ever after, but i doubt it.  Bring on the first scathing reviews of Shrek 3...",1087257600,5,2394,4.485057471264367
1490728,4,B00005JMQZ,"Well, all right, you probably WON'T cry--unless it's the proverbial ""tears of laughter.""  SHREK 2 was inevitable, but wasn't necessarily inevitable that it would succeed.  In fact, given the success rate of sequels, there was a good chance that SHREK 2 would fall flat on its lime green face.
If like me, you were a little wary, you can relax, grab some popcorn (easy on the butter now) and your beverage of choice and settle down for a chuckle fest.  Chock-a-bloc with inside jokes for adults but enough whimsy for kids, it's more FRACTURED FAIRY TALES than SNOW WHITE, but it's got the quality animation of Disney's (recent) best along with all that irreverent humor.
SHREK 2 seems less high adventure than its predecessor.  In some ways, it's less startling too, since the characters are pretty familiar by now and no longer all that fresh.  The infusion of newer characters (the hallmark of most successful secrets) makes all the difference.  Voiced by such luminaries as Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett and AB FAB's Jennifer Saunders, the film proves to be the animated equivalent of stunt casting.  Again, that's a little nod to the adults in the audience, the ones who have an inkling as to who these actors are. They each bring something of their actual personae to their cartoon roles, and the movie is all the richer for it.
The most recent batch of ads for SHREK 2 feature blurbs from several critics suggesting that one viewing is not enough.  Very true. I'm sure I missed a ton of sight gags, to say nothing of the one liners I didn't hear because I was laughing too hard. That's not to say that I'll make all my viewings theatrical ones though. That could get kind of pricey. Fortunately, the DVD is just months away.",1087084800,3,1742,4.688524590163935

I was pleasantly surprised at the clever story and racy humor. (Complaining parents should have taken the PG rating into consideration.) The pop culture references and insider jokes were nothing short of brilliant and really added to the fun. The visual details are jaw-dropping. This is not better or worse than the original. It is definitely in the same level and the must-see of summer movies. I can't wait to see what they do for the third film!,1087084800,4,571,4.836734693877551
1490730,3,B00005JMQZ,"As you know, Shrek 1 was a pretty-well thought-out movie that was not only funny, but very clever and witty with some things.
Shrek 2 however; As the plot kicks in sort of where the first one left. But the living happilly ever after idea comes to a halt here in the seaqul. Apon return from Shrek and Fionas honey-moon. They recieve an invitation from Fionas parent's to come and see them. So Shrek and Fiona, and of coarse Donkey travle far, far away to the kingdom called just that to meet the royal parent's , who's voice's are -John Cleese- and -Julie Andrew's.
But with them beeing Ogre's, there parents don't even recignise there daughter, but accept that it's her, but the King and Shrek don't get along at all. And Fiona was supposed to be rescues by the Fairy God Mother's(Brown haired woman from Ab-Fab?) son who would go on to become Prince. With all the disliking to the ogar, many things happen to Shrek, and the king and the fairy godmother are out to rid Shrek, and get the daughter to marry a prince charming.
Many of the charactors return from the first - Shrek, Fiona and Doney of coarse. Alos the three little pig's, ginger bread man, the cross dressing big bad wolf and a couple of other's. And this time around they meet a new freind - Puss in boot's. Who I wasn't very impressed with, but i'm sure people like my girlfreind would be saying ""awww how cute"" to a certin look the cat does in the movie.
However, the movie did have a few good laugh, and a few clever thing's to look at like -limosine carridge's and When Donkey arrive's in Far Far Away there is a head shot that resembles his kind of entrence to Beverly Hill's in Beverly Hills Cop, so there are still a few thing's to pick up on like that, just like in the first.
But overall, I wouldnt say it compares to the original. It was definitly not as funny. And the fart joke's are pretty immature, only the kid's will laugh at those - they really need to think fart jokes through to make them funny, not just stick a sound in here and there expecting a laugh. Shrek 2 I wouldnt say I wanna see again anytime soon, but with a 6 year old neice, i'll probably see it a thousand time, just like when in under the first week of owning Shrek 1 on VHS she'd watched it so many times it was already beeing veiwed in Black and White!
The kid's will probably love the movie. But I don't think much of it had an entertainment mix for the adult's either, the thing's that adult's would pick up on really just arnt funny. And you'll probably just think 'the children wouldnt have a clue what that is parodeeing"" (Shrek and Fiona kissing on the beach)
Overall, ive seen worse movies, but this movie had it's moments. Love pretty much end's up conqouring all. And you pretty much know what will happen. But please, don't get your hope's up too high if you loved the 1st and are dieing for this one to deliver just the same. I rate it 3, I don't hate it, but I don't love it, it's just gonnah be decent. I personaly wouldnt wanna own it, but as you know, the kid's will always want there very own copy. And the DVD is sure to be packed chocha-block full of extra's. We'll just have to wait and see what the DVD bring's now.
An idea would be for the Shrek 2 DVD to include the Shrek 3D movie. How they could release that with the original Shrek after everyone had already bought Shrek 1 is unbeleivable. They sure know how to make money out of these thing's.",1086998400,,3421,4.2727272727272725
1490731,5,B00005JMQZ,"A film by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, Conrad Vernon
""Shrek 2"" is the animated follow-up to 2001's enormously successful ""Shrek"".  In the first film, Shrek (Mike Meyers) went on a quest, accompanied by a donkey (Eddie Murphy) to rescue the Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon.  While the outline of the story was familiar, there were numerous twists that made ""Shrek"" original: the hero was an ogre, so was the princess (it turned out), the dragon fell in love with the donkey, and the film turned so many fairy tale conventions on its head all the while poking fun at Disney.  ""Shrek 2"" promises to be more of the same.
Shrek and Fiona are now married and are just returning from their honeymoon and they are to travel to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews).  Fiona's parents do not know that she married an ogre, or even that she is still an ogre.  It was the King who locked Fiona in that tower with the intent that she be rescued by Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and his kiss would keep her from ever turning ogre again.  The King takes an immediate dislike to Shrek and with prodding from the evil Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), hires an assassin to take out Shrek.  The assassin: Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas).  Failing to kill Shrek and hearing his side of the story, Puss decides to join Shrek in his new quest to ensure Fiona's love.
To say that Puss steals every scene that he is in would be an understatement.  He is the funniest character in the movie, and his animation was so great that when tries to be a cute kitty the entire theatre audience said ""awww"" every time.  ""Shrek 2"" has, perhaps, the best animation that I've seen.  At times the characters look so real that I forgot that they were supposed to be animated, and this doesn't even touch on the beauty and realism of the background.  It makes one wonder where the animators can go from here, and what the animation could be like in five years.  There is less of straightforward plotline in ""Shrek 2"", at least compared to the original ""Shrek"", but the film more than makes up for it in humor.  The jokes are great and work on several levels, some for the kids, some for the adults, and others for people who have seen a whole lot of movies.  There are sight gags a plenty, with a personal favorite being the giant Gingerbread man (think ""Ghostbusters""), having a Farbucks (Starbucks) right across the street from another Farbucks, and the whole sequence of ""Knights"" (Cops).  In fact, the only thing I didn't like was the songs that have always felt out of place to me (though not as out of place as Smashmouth being in the first ""Shrek"").  The bottom line is that this was one of the more enjoyable experiences I've had recently at the theatre, and I would certainly recommend ""Shrek 2"".

1490761,5,B00005JMQZ,"First of all, I have to say, I LOVED THIS MOVIE! The animation is impeccable, the characters are cast perfectly, and the humor is outrageous. I haven't had so much fun watching a film in ages. The writers have worked in more fairytales than ever before. We get peeks at Hansel and Gretel, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, not to mention the prominent Puss in Boots (hilarious), and the evil Fairy Godmother. I was amazed at the amount of originality and fun packed into this movie.
Having said that, I would be iffy about taking the young ones to see it. As others have mentioned in their reviews, there is much more adult humor than in the first Shrek film. Pinocchio is wearing women's underwear, and Shrek and Fiona make it clear that they want to ""enjoy"" their wedding night without Donkey. Of course, everyone has to judge whether their children can handle it, but just be aware that this film is racier than before.",1086912000,3,917,4.631901840490798
1490762,5,B00005JMQZ,"This movie was awsome!! It was way better than the first 1!
Was Halariously funny with more adult/teenage jokes.
It is deffently must see movie!!!!!
Don't wait till it comes out on dvd/vhs see it on the Big Screen!
Its just sooooooooo funny!",1086912000,2,241,4.627906976744186
1490763,4,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 did not seem like a good idea at first.  The first Shrek was so popular and well written.  If the sequel is really bad, it would diminish the achievements of the original.  Luckily, Shrek 2 captures the charm, cleverness and overall originality of the original movie.
Shrek 2 is based on the premises that Shrek and Fionna just got back from their honeymoon and go to visit Fionna's parents to recieve approval from her parents.  Fionna's parents do not know that Fionna is an ogre and that Shrek is an ogre.  Fionna's dad, the king, wants Fionna to marry Prince Charmming and so does her Fairy Godmother.  The King then lures Shrek away from Fionna and Shrek has to stop Fionna from marrying Prince Charmming (if I told you why she is going to marry Prince Charmming, I would ruin the story).
This Shrek introduces a few new characters.  One being Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas.  I really liked this character and thought that the character was very funny.  Also Fionna's parents, Prince Charmming and the Fairy Godmother all come into play this time around.  Mike Myers plays Shrek again, but I really don't care for him too much as Shrek.  The voice that he uses sounds like the same one that he uses for all of his characters.  My favorite is still Donkey, whom is voiced by Eddie Murphy.  This character basically provides all of the humor in the movie and Eddie does a great job as this character.
Overall I would say that this movie is good.  Its nothing particuarly special, but I would definately recommend seeing this movie.  It kinda dies out a little in the end, especially when they perform ""Livin' La Vida Loca.""  Gag!  I don't think that this movie will do any damage to the original because it is good enough, its just not good enough to bring in a third installment.",1086739200,10,1803,4.549689440993789

It was not funny and with the new characters coming in, puuuuuuuuhleeeeeeze. What a bore and how are children supposed to relate to a storyline that talks about marriage? I know they are making a shrek 3. I won't waste my money on it though.",1086652800,2,382,4.1066666666666665
1490765,5,B00005JMQZ,"We join Shrek (Myers) and Fiona (Diaz) after they return from their honeymoon. They intend on returning to Shrek's little house in the swamp, when a herald brings them a message that the king (Cleese) and queen (Fiona's parents) want to present their daughter and her new husband to the people of their country.
Shrek, Fiona and the Donkey (Murphy) set off to the kingdom. Shrek fears though that being an ogre, he'll probably get the usual reaction from the people.
Shortly after arriving, Shrek gets into an argument with the king, who is being blackmailed by the Fairy Godmother. She wants her son, Prince Charming to marry Fiona, and is intended on seeing this will happen.
Shrek will have to overcome his fear that Fiona doesn't love him for who he is, but that she cares about the fact he is (and looks like) an ogre. He'll have to reconquer Fiona's heart (who, by help of a magic spell from the Fairy Godmother has fallen for Prince Charming). Aided by the Donkey and the cat Puss In Boots (Banderaz) he hopefully will rescue Fiona.
The graphics are amazing. People move more lifelike than ever, and Dreamworks shows the latest possible techniques. The cast is exceptionally well cast (just like Shrek 1).
So is this movie funny? Yes, it sure is. While still taking a few jabs at Disney, a whole array of movies, tv shows and events are ridiculed. You'll be in stitches over Puss In Boots, Pinocchio, and the series Knights.
Finally there's the underlying lesson of no matter what, true love will conquer everything.
For everyone looking for entertainment, a good laugh, or just a nice way to pass an hour and a half, this is definitely recommended.",1086566400,4,1656,4.694158075601375

The casts were all great!  The acting was superb and DONKEY RULES!
Every one should see it even if some little ones don't get the adult humor.

Oh well, basically it's very predictable, and well you can see each joke coming even before they say it, so if you want to be surprised, see something else, but if you want a good family film, then by all means see this film, but I suggest that people wait to rent this.",1086480000,,441,3.966292134831461
1490768,5,B00005JMQZ,"The whole audience spent the first 15 minute laughing. Then it got better.
This movie really is just as good as the first. The way it starts, 'happily ever after' really had come true. We see Shrek and Fiona very much in love, sharing the bathroom mirror in the morning, even hot-tubbing together. (This is Shrek - don't bite the bubbles.)
Then comes the problem: dinner with the in-laws. Shrek, of course, isn't quite what they had planned for their little girl. I'm not giving out spoliers, but Daddy's relationship with Shrek takes on a decidedly un-fatherly tone. What worse, he's in league with the Fairy Godmother. I don't know where she came from, but was probably married to The Godfather. After many goings-on, the happy couple wins out in the end.
As in Shrek I, getting there is the fun. Donkey is the same motor-mouthed wise guy, and has Bandeira's Puss to work with. The voices are great. Julie Andrews (as other movies have shown) is the essential queen and mother. John Cleese is the King, but never gets a chance for the full range Cleese-ish abilities. The animation is incredible. Things like rain are very convincing, and even the little nubs on Shrek's sweater look good. The gross-out humor isn't as strong as in Shrek I, but that's a small enough loss.
If you liked Shrek I, you'll like this too. I don't think the sequel surpasses the original, but certainly equals it.",1086480000,5,1392,4.685714285714286

[REVIEW]
To think that a movie like Shrek, a movie so funny and original in style, wouldn't possibly come to mind that its sequel was in the mix...oh wait, it has, and so does everyone else.  But what really comes to mind: is the sequel going to be better than its predecessor?  Validly, I would say nay, but is the movie terrible?  Man, Shrek II is definitely far, far away from the putrid swamp of mediocrity.  Dreamworks SKG decides to bring more bang for the viewer's buck to package in the Shrek sequel with more action, more humor, more interesting fairy tale characters, and more ""jackass"" than Bam Margera's entire career.
Once upon a time, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and his horse are riding from plains to deserts and to swamplands to go to the dragon's lair and save the fair maiden that is Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).  Unfortunately, he's a fairy tale length too late, and ogre Fiona and her now husband Shrek (Mike Myers) are having a ball at their wacky honeymoon(Wait a minute!  ORGE Fiona?  Does her existence kind of spoils the twist from the first movie that some people haven`t seen, thanks to countless amounts of commercial airplay?).  After their honeymoon, they got a message from the King and Queen (Fiona's mum and dad; ""Mary Poppins"" Julie Andrews and ""Monty Python"" John Cleese, respectfully) saying they should visit the land of Far, Far Away for a family reunion.  Shrek, Fiona, and their ever-annoying Donkey travel the long path towards the Hollywood-like scenery that is FFA, and as they finally stopped at the castle of Fiona's parents, the parents were at horrible sight from lovely eyes as they gaze not the beautiful couple, but...ogres.  It then becomes a ""Meet the Parents""-like situation, having Shrek to try and get along with Fiona's uptight father ad hilarity.  What can be worse than already Shrek has to go through?  How about Shrek finding a potion that would make him and his wife human to prolong their happiness, while dealing with the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) that wants to rid the ogre so she can get her son, Prince Charming, to marry Fiona, as well as the King hiring a cat to assassinate Shrek.  Twisted story, ain't it?
One thing that succeed the most in this sequel, and what makes people come to see the movie in the first place, is the visuals(come on, you must've seen this coming).  I must say, this movie may be the most technical visual stunner out of all the 3-D movies I've seen; take that, ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within!""  Much improved over the first film(not surprising, though): better lighting, more realistic movements on the characters, better facial expressions; the level of detail on the visuals was tremendous, I can see the grass flowing, the ripples in the water, even the split ends from Fiona`s hair.  The visuals wouldn't work, however, if it  wasn't for the wonderful cast to coincide its looks.  My favorite in terms of strong casting is still Donkey, and the newest character, Puss...in Boots(Antonio Banderas), the assassinating cat; who knew that a Mexican killer/avenger can play such a funny role as the furious feline who coughs hairballs and acts cute in front of the audience.
What more is there in Shrek II: more pop culture references.  The movie is funny in its own right, but it's the endless amount of pop culture references that left me with mixed feelings.  Shrek II covered up almost everything from the media:  ""Alien"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Lord of the Rings"", etc.  I like what the producers did with ""COPS"" in this movie when Shrek and Donkey were coming back to the castle from the deep forest for reasons I can't spoil, and knights portraying policemen were running after them like they're drug dealers and the cops were being rough and unfair to them when they capture them like the show.  Man, that was the funniest scene right there.  To be honest, the references are a bit much, but as long as its funny, that won't be a problem.
You know what, everything about this movie is so funny.  The jokes were done in good timing, the story's full of twist and turns without all the confusing, but overall, its witty and full of light-hearted attitude that seem safe for any kind of person to enjoy, young or old.  I hardly see any drawbacks that I can joke around with, for that comes out to another animated excellence, and makes it forgivable for all those worthless licensed product placement.  Shrek II is great from beginning to overly-climatic end, and while it's not on par with the original, it's still worthy of having five stars, so `Shrek' it out and enjoy the fun...unless you have a thing against green, ugly ogres and fart humor.",1086393600,5,4860,4.794964028776978
1490808,4,B00005JMQZ,"This movie is wonderfully done. The opening segment of Shrek and Fiona on their honeymoon was the stuff that fairy tales are made of. I enjoyed that very much. Once the honeymoon was over, Shrek and Fiona are invited to 'Far far away' to meet Fiona's parents. This is where the new fun begins. The fairy godmother wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming and she plots with Fiona's father, the King, to make this happen.
Many scenes in this movie will leave you laughing in your seats. Donkey getting turned into a stallion was hilarious! The mission impossible scene to free Shrek was so amusing. The giant ginger bread man (reminiscent of Lord of the Rings) was a riot. And Puss N' Boots added a new element that was simply delightful!
The only really criticism I have of this movie was that it was a bit short. But that just leaves you wanting more. Enter Shrek 3?",1086393600,2,871,4.484276729559748
1490809,3,B00005JMQZ,Shrek 1 is much better than the second. While Shrek 2 has some charm. For instance when Shrek first met his in-laws and the arguing that follows. Also Shrek in human form was great. If it wasn't for Donkey. This movie would be a bust. Donkey is first-rate in both films. His hilarious are we there yet is funny. Puss was also great played by Antonio Banderas was good. But stick with the first movie.,1086393600,5,400,4.346666666666667
1490810,5,B00005JMQZ,"The first movie was great, ingenious and an innovation in animated film. Shrek 2 in one word is a ""Masterpiece"". Rarely do you see a Sequel being better than the first one, Shrek 2 is the exception. What make this movie better than the first one is that they added more characters which were put into play well in the movie. The actors who did the voices in Shrek 2 did it well with their characters themselves, they brought to life each character with their voice tone. An example of that is Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas), was a great addition to the movie he gave the movie a little extra spice in the humor department. And thank to the technology available they make his face so cute and adorable that everyone just falls in love with Puss-in-boots. Also the addition of the Fairy God Mother gave this movie a different atmosphere. In most animated film the Fairy God Mother is a person with a noble heart and love for everyone. However, not this Fairy God mother she was selfish and evil. And her son Prince Charming was no different. At first I felt sorry for poor prince Charming traveling through snowstorms, desserts and find that his future princess was already marry and that she was in her honeymoon. But as the movie progress we saw that he was like his mom, self-centered.
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there Yet?
Donkey the next American Idol after seeing his debut as a Spanglish singer I think he has a great chance. Donkey was the heart of the first movie and in the second movie although I think he has a lot of competition with Puss-in-boots at the end he is one of the character the makes Shrek enjoyable every time you watch it. In this second movie we see Donkey (Eddie Murphy) turned into a stallion after drinking from the magic portion. I think we have to give a lot of credit to donkey because his role as a stallion for like 30 minutes was to perfection.
In addition, one of the things that I love about this movie is that is so realistic that you can connect it with real life. Shrek and Fiona got marry in the first movie most fairy tales movie will end it there. DreamWorks gave this movie a real life scenario. Most marriage after the honeymoon start having problem because misunderstanding, parent interfering or they just find themselves not made for each other. In Shrek 2 we saw that just after the honeymoon, Shrek and Fiona started to have these typical problems that happen after marriage.
Also just like the first one this movie have a message in it.
The first movie's message was not to judge people by their cover.
Shrek 2 message is that sometime you have to make changes in your life in order to live happily ever after.
The technology used in this movie was fantastic it make it look even more realistic than the first one.  Viewer will enjoy even more because of all the details in the movies.
I highly recommend that everyone goes watch this movie no matter what age you are, you will laugh, cry, and fall in love with Puss-in-boots and The Gingerbread man.",1086220800,5,3019,4.479128856624319
1490811,4,B00005JMQZ,"Ogres do not live happily ever after, at least according to the Fairy Godmother in SHREK II, but viewers of this film may disagree. The movie begins where SHREK leaves off: Fiona and Shrek arrive home after their honeymoon and are invited to a wedding ball hosted by Fiona's parents. This leads to the first incidents of marital stress for the young couple. The pair goes to meet the parents who are surprised by their daughter's green and slightly heavy set appearance and her husband's cumbersome ways and ""not so Prince Charming"" looks. The queen understands that her daughter is in love, but the king has a more difficult time with the marriage. Through a number of twists and turns, the love of the two prevails, the parents come around, and all ends up happily ever after.
SHREK II has the best qualities of the first film, while adding some very humorous additions. There is more tongue in cheek humor and a number of double entendres (since John Cleese of British comedy fame is the voice of the king, could we expect anything more?). We learn that Fairy Godmothers are not all they are cracked up to be, and that Prince Charming is a rather vain fellow. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz all return as the voices of Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona respectively with newcomers to the series Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett, and Antonio Banderas as the Queen, Prince Charming, and Puss-in-Boots.
Movie critics with credentials and famous names have praised the film, so my words are not all that surprising. I am willing to bet that at least some of the people who are reading this review will wonder of it's appropriate for children. It is animated which would appear to be family friendly, but it's also rated PG. I went to see the film with parents and younger children. Most agreed that it is good for the family, and there are far worse films with the rating PG. One mother did say she would gladly bring her younger children because they would be amused with a non-violent film, but she wondered if slightly older children (between ages 8-12) may get some of the jokes aimed at the adults in the audience. Still, it's a movie viewers cannot help but love a movie such as SHREK II and since it grossed over $90 million in its first weekend, I know I am not alone.",1086048000,4,2275,4.592137592137592

Well, the honeymoon definitely ends when they get back to the swamp and see Donkey there.  And find out that Fiona's parents want to meet the new groom.  The story goes from there and is HILARIOUS!  Antonio Banderas joins the gang as Puss in Boots.  Julie Andrews is Fiona's mom and John Cleese is her dad.  It is a great cast of characters and you will laugh the entire time.

1490813,5,B00005JMQZ,"After winning the love of his life and going on his honeymoon, what's a big green ogre to do?  Why meet the in-laws, of course, in SHREK 2, a delightfully over-the-top confection that picks up where the original left off and never lets go.  In this one, the big green galoot (again voiced in a Scottish brogue by Mike Myers) and his now green hued bride, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are summoned to visit her royal parents (Julie Andrews and John Cleese).  With the always talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy) in tow, Shrek finds that he and his father in law do NOT get along very well.  Complicating matters is the fact that Fiona was supposed to marry the handsome, but egotistical, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett).  Under pressure from Charming's mother, the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), the king hires famed ogre-killer Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas spoofing his Zorro role) to handle things.  Eventually, Puss switches sides and matters spin headlong to the eventual wild and fun conclusion.

As always, the voice work is wonderful with Myers, Diaz and Murphy reprising their roles.  Julie Andrews is a regal delight as the Queen, while John Cleese is a hoot as King Harold, Fiona's royal dad with a secret of his own. Jennifer Saunders gives Martha Stewart a run for her money as the nasty Fairy Godmother, while Joan Rivers and Larry King make the most of a couple choice cameos.  However, the movie is practically stolen from under everyone's nose by Banderas' delightful Puss in Boots.  Envisioned as a tiny tabby with a swashbuckling complex, Puss easily gets some of the best laughs in the movie.  His best moments include a ""Cops"" spoof and a secret weapon that is both heartbreaking and gut busting hilarious.

As always, the animation is top-notch.  In fact, it improves on the solid original.  Some people may find the film slow going at first despite the humor, but things definitely go into high gear once Puss in Boots enters.

A rare case of sequel equaling its parent, SHREK 2 provides laughs and heart in equal measure making this film a must see!!!!!",1086048000,,2081,4.822535211267605

A word of advise: do not leave the theater as soon as the credits start rolling. If you do, you will miss a small addition to the movie that breaks into the middle of the credits that is just about the funniest part of the whole film.

1490815,4,B00005JMQZ,"Sequelitis is a common affliction among movies.  Often times the follow-up to a film is of a lesser quality than the original.  2004 seems to be the year of the sequels, with Spider-Man 2 and the third Harry Potter film.  The first offering is Shrek 2.
Shrek 2 picks up where the orginial left off.  Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) return from their honeymoon only to recived an invitation from Fiona's parents.  The King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of the land Far, Far Away have invited the couple to a wedding ball in their honor.  Despite Shrek's misgivings, the couple are soon on their way, with the irritating Donkey (Eddie Murphy) in tow.  But Fiona has neglected to tell her parents that her new husband is an ogre, and that she's now an ogre as well, so when they arrive, they take her parents, and the town, by surprise.  Adding to the king's displeasure at Shrek is the fact that when he locked Fiona in the tower, he had made a deal with the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) that Fiona would marry the Godmother's son, the vain Prince Charming (Rupert Everett).  And Fairy Godmother's hell bent on matching her son up with Fiona, so the king hires ogre killer Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) to take care of Shrek.
The plot has some similarities with the original Shrek, but is unique enough to be its own vehicle.  For a sequel that was never intended to be, it's an entertaining romp with old and new characters.  The main villian in this movie, who fans will undoubtedly refer to as ""Dama Fortuna"", though never refered to as such in the film, is played with a delicious combination of benign malice throughout the film, a match for John Lithgow's Lord Farquaad in the first.  Fiona is given less of a role here in this movie, but that's fine as most of the action is set on Shrek, Donkey, and Puss-in-Boots.  The lampooning of previous films and Hollywood itself is rampant in this movie, from ""Lord of the Rings"" to Starbucks Coffee.
The only disappointment to this film was the music.  As might have been expected, the score is almost the same as the original film, which isn't a bad thing.  Most of the songs used in the film is okay, but there were a few that didn't fit with the scene it was playing on.  Still, it's hard to find fault with the Counting Crows' ""Accidentally in Love"" or Jennifer Saunders' rendition of ""Holding Out For a Hero.""
Despite the flaws and several goofs, ""Shrek 2"" is as good as the original.  Go see it while it's still in theaters, but catch the mantinee showings.",1086048000,,2543,4.566079295154185

We just recently had the pleasure of viewing this whilst visiting from Australia.  It was just superb, the colour, sound, story line etc etc was just so funny, we have never laughed so much.  Much much better than the first one.  We have come back to Australia totally singing the praises of Shrek 2.
Cannot wait for the DVD to be released",1085961600,,437,4.4375
1490857,5,B00005JMQZ,"This movie had me laughing from the start.  The trio Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey are as hilarious as they were in the first series.  Fiona and Shrek, now married enjoy their honeymoon and come back to the loquacious Donkey.  They don't show the dragon that he had a relationship with.  Fiona, now an ogre, gets a letter from her parents that she is to return to them.  It's a shock for her parents to see their daughter as an ogre.
Antonio Banderas is funny in his role as Puss in Boots.  He comes out as mysterious and feisty.  Then he gives you this sad look and you can't help but feel pity.  Hee-hee!  The trio Donkey, Shrek and Puss are on another adventure.  To win Fiona's heart even it means changing their looks.
The movie like the first, shows the viewer that beneath the humor, there is a lesson to be learned when it comes to appearances.",1085961600,,847,4.337579617834395

Don't get me wrong - there were some very funny bits sprinkled through, but they were not worth the price of admission (or the time it took out of my Memorial Day weekend).",1085961600,2,370,4.257142857142857
1490859,4,B00005JMQZ,"If you've seen Shrek 2, you've probably seen Shrek.  In summation, Shrek (Mike Myers) is an ogre.  A prince who has a distinct taste for the mundane and is uh, ""vertically challenged,"" drives all the fairy tale beings from his kingdom right into Shrek's swamp. This course of events puts Shrek and donkey (a talking ass, played by Eddie Murphy) into a series of events that ultimately lead to Shrek rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a tower and ultimately marrying her.  Princess Fiona switches forms between a comely human female and an ogress at night, until she experiences ""true love's first kiss.""  In a twist on the traditional fairy tale, the kiss from Shrek transforms the princess into her ogress form. The End.
Enter Shrek 2, picking up right where Shrek left off.  Fiona was originally a human, so it's time for her human parents to meet both Fiona in her now permanent ogress form and Shrek who...well, who is always an ogre.
What happens next is the usual comedic plot of the new beau as a fish-out-of-water.  The King  (John Cleese) and Shrek don't get along.  Complicating matters is the fact that Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), the progeny of the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders).
Distraught over the obvious distaste Fiona's father has for her new son-in-law, Shrek seeks out a solution from the Fairy Godmother and gets it in the form of a Happily Ever After potion.  The potion transforms everyone into what they most desire, but the effects only become permanent if sealed with a kiss before midnight. Of course.
The movie is filled with in-jokes that whiz by at high speed.  My wife and I caught jokes that the parents in the audience didn't - especially one where donkey (Eddie Murphy, remember) was framed by palm tress behind him and music that was a throwback to Eddie's Beverly Hills Cop movies. Conversely, while the children laughed at a lot of the fart jokes, there wasn't enough action to keep them entertained the entire time.  At various intervals, the audience was audibly restless.
And that's the problem with Shrek 2.  Shrek and Fiona's problems sound suspiciously like they're heading for divorce - remember, they're married, not dating - and the parental/new spouse arguments might be a little bit too close to home for some.  While Shrek spoofed Disney, Shrek 2 spoofs Hollywood, a spoof that's been done to death.
By far the best part of the movie is Puss-in-Boots, played by Antonio Banderas.  Part swashbuckler, part cute little tabby, Puss is hired by the King to kill Shrek.  Ignoring for a moment that Fiona's father is trying to kill his son-in-law, Puss steals the show. Never has an animated character so captured the cuteness and sexiness of an actor all rolled up into a ball of fur.  In fact, he's so good that...this quote sums it up:
Puss-in-Boots: Pray for mercy from... Puss! - In boots. Fear me, if you dare.
Donkey: I'm sorry, but the position for annoying talking animal has already been taken!
True.  But Puss is cuter and funnier.  Donkey, while occasionally amusing, is simply not necessary.
Shrek 2 also suffers from not having a lot for the characters to do.  Some of Shrek's quips are just plain tired.  Even some of the old cast, including Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, and the Gingerbread Man are back.  The jokes - a new twist on an old fairy tale - no longer apply.  Heck, the Gingerbread Man appears in Wal-Mart commercials!
Shrek 2 has enough in-jokes to keep parents entertained.  But it's not as good as the original, because much of the original's charm came from being the first to lampoon fairy tales in a Disney-fied society.",1085961600,,3688,4.773228346456693
1490860,5,B00005JMQZ,"Fiona and Shrek are blissful ogres on their honeymoon in ""Shrek 2,"" the delightful new animated film from Dreamworks.  Shrek would like nothing better than to wallow in the swamp and lie  on the beach with the love of his life.  The couple's solitude is disturbed, however, when the fast-talking and impudent donkey who was Shrek's sidekick in the first movie knocks on their door and makes himself at home.  Donkey is too clueless to know that two's company and three's a crowd.  Shrek is even more chagrined when Princess Fiona's parents, the King and Queen, invite their daughter and her new husband to the palace.  Shrek correctly predicts that his in-laws will be shocked when they discover that their daughter married an ogre.  In fact, the King desperately wants Fiona to dump Shrek and marry Prince Charming, a fey blond egomaniac who is overly attached to his pushy mother.  All this conflict puts a strain on the newlyweds.
""Shrek 2"" scores in all areas.  The acting is marvelous, with Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz heading an all-star cast.  Jennifer Saunders is a standout as an aggressive fairy godmother with a mean streak.  The animation is terrific, the special effects are marvelous, and there are musical numbers, satirical allusions, and lots of sight gags to entertain kids and adults alike. Kick back and enjoy this perfect summer movie.",1085961600,,1372,4.921739130434783
1490861,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is a delightful and very funny movie.  The animation is even better than the first movie and at times is just stunning.  Because the characters are somewhat familiar from the first movie some of the surprise and strangeness is not as pronounced as in the first movie.  However, the writers play successful and fresh riffs with those familiar notes.
We do meet new folks, Fiona's parents, in the kingdom of Far Far Away.  They are delightfully played by John Cleese and Julie Andrews.  Jennifer Saunders (from Absolutely Fabulous) plays the Fairy Queen who has a lot going on under the mask of being a loving and helpful granter of wishes.  Terrific!
There are many wonderful visual jokes as well.  Just watch closely and you will be constantly delighted.  Some of the jokes from the first movie are built upon and recast for even more fun.

I feel this is one of the worst cartoon I have ever seen since The Lion King. The original Shrek was a good enough movie, nothing to go nuts over, but funny just the same. But this.... is just too much for me to bear. Dreamworks should close down after making this horrible movie. What a sellout!

Nevertheless, I loved the movie as much as the first one - the detail in the animation and scenery is awesome.  It is a great movie - very funny!",1085961600,,415,4.024390243902439

Not as fun, but funnier than the first, SHREK 2 delivers some great animation, quick fluid plotting, quirky characters, and some side  splitting laughs.  The script this time around has more inside jokes, making the film almost more fun for adults than for the target audience children.  But that is cool, with more quality products being released from the likes of PDI (DREAMWORKS) and PIXAR (DISNEY), the family film now encompasses the entire family, a feat that 2D animation rarely achieved.

My advice--wait until it comes out on DVD unless you just want to take your kids to a movie.",1085875200,,356,4.057142857142857
1490905,5,B00005JMQZ,"I can remember almost laughing at the idea of a sequel to the first movie from the summer of 2001. The first ""Shrek"" movie was an absolutely hilarious work of genius by the animation studio crew and the storyline was absolutely brilliant and original. This sequel entitled ""Shrek 2"" is every bit as funny, witty and excellent as the original and perfectly continues the story of the legendary green Ogre. (CAUTION: Some spoilers may be present but hopefully not.)
 Picking right up where everything left off on the first, Shrek and Fiona as the newly wed ogres are happily married and live in the swamp where Shrek himself lived on his own before his previous adventure took him away to face off against Farquaad. Now he and Princess Fiona take a chance and head off to a place `Far Far Away' where they actually head to a large Parisian city with a sort of Hollywood like culture to see and visit Fiona's parents however, the parents have no idea of the fact that their own daughter is actually an ogre and when they do in fact meet her new husband, they vehemently disapprove of the marriage between them and things turn really bad between Shrek and his new in-laws. The King has had a long dislike for ogres and even the Queen is shocked but at least tries to tolerate Shrek and the fact that their daughter is in fact an ogre but just barely.
 Meanwhile a magical flying witch named The Fairy Godmother along with her son Prince Charming who hates ogres aim to break up Shrek and Fiona's marriage and have Fiona marry her `real' love. However all of them are unaware that the Fairy Godmother and Fiona's father have forged a secret deal to have Fiona and Prince Charming marry and for Shrek, the ogre to leave her life forever by using a special potion that brings `true love'. Shrek aims to use a special potion that brings `true happiness' when taken and Shrek and his donkey aim to repair the fallout from the disastrous confrontation with Fiona's father. Fiona on the other hand, is not turned on by Prince Charming but the manipulation of him and The Fairy Godmother may jeopardize she and Shrek's marriage. Now Shrek, along with Donkey along with a new sidekick cat called Puss In Boots are on an adventure to save Shrek and Fiona's marriage before it's too late.
 Just like the first one, I adore and laugh to the many ways that ""Shrek 2"" makes fun of the classic fairy tales. A lot of the jokes from the first one are present on this sequel and Shrek and the talking donkey are both a riot but one of the highlight characters however was the newcomer Puss In Boots! Man Puss In Boots is so hilarious and Antonio Banderas provides amazing voice work and really brings his character to life on the big screen. Once again Mike Myers is absolutely fantastic providing the voice work of Shrek and the characters personality is so rich and real. Cameron Diaz is once again awesome as the feisty Princess Fiona as she is stuck between choosing to remain with Shrek or go with Prince `Charming'. Eddie Murphy was absolutely hilarious providing the voice work for the quirky and excessively loquacious Talking Donkey. As a matter of fact, the entire cast was absolutely phenomenal and were made for this movie.
 Once again the animation is just amazing and the various sceneries are well filmed and the storyline is just as strong and entertaining as the first one. The first one will always remain the best for me due to the fact that it was really original but this sequel gets my nod as one of the best sequels in many years, up there with ""X-Men United"", and ""Terminator 2"". But on top of it all, while it is generally aimed to be funny, it is also brings out a very important message of how true love goes far beyond just physical appearances, and really relies on strong character and honesty and also with this message which would sometimes be told in a boring manner, instead is told through a really funny, intelligent and excellent animated movie. Almost anyone can find a lot of great things with both this and it's predecessor. The kids will love it for it's light-hearted humor and cartoony look and adults and older audiences will love it for it's excellent plot and incredible characters. Even my 86 year old grandmother loved it and wants to see it again. That should explain enough of how appealing this movie is for the various age groups. There are some scenes that may be a bit questionable for small kids but most will not notice.
 I also love the way that this movie spoofs almost every fairytale that you can imagine. In fact, this movie makes extremely hilarious spoofs of almost everything you can imagine and some of the silly behavior like Donkey when he pops his tongue during one scene made me laugh so hard that I felt like my eyeballs were going to pop right out of their sockets. There are a lot more hilarious scenes but I do not want to spoil it for the viewers. In almost every way, ""Shrek 2"" defies the trap that often ruins sequels by continuing the story in a reasonable way and retaining the styles of the first while expanding the storyline. I can never say how much I really enjoyed this movie other than saying that you should see this movie because it is already one of the best movies of 2004! Everybody clapped when it was done. That should be enough to recommend that you go and see it today! You will not be disappointed, not by any stretch of the imagination!

There are still laugh out loud moments. I dug Antonio Banderas' character and some of the cameos. It still functions on different levels and definitely knows how to work the adults. There's a particularly funny scene with Pinnochio towards the end of the movie. And Puss in Boots poses are hilarious. A little bit of the plot was suprising but more of the plot borrowed elements from what was successful in the first film without having the benefit of surprise or much heroism. I read a Washington Post review that said this thing had no plot and was about nothing. That review is definitely harsh. The film did have a plot and does progress towards an ending. Know that the plot does play a secondary role to the jokes and the satirical elements.
This is a quality sequel and I think the franchise still has some steam left in it. My bet for the third installment is that Shrek junior makes an appearance.

1490908,5,B00005JMQZ,"I had always thought that the sequel was worse than the original.  With Shrek 2, I'm proved quite totally wrong.  Shrek 2 has the same type of biting humor, with plenty of jabs at pop culture.  It starts right where the first Shrek ended --- Fiona and Shrek go on their honeymoon.  Shrek, Fiona and Donkey then go on a 600 mile trip to Fiona's kingdom (Far, Far Away) and have ""coach fever"" (i.e. really get on each other's nerves).  Upon arrival, they have to Meet The In-Laws, and things don't go smoothly.  Turns out the folks aren't too happy about Fiona's husband, Shrek.  He wasn't exactly what they expected!  Unknown to Shrek, Fiona was expected to marry Prince Charming.
From here, a lot happens in a short amount of time, where Fiona's dad hires Puss In Boots to assassinate Shrek, Shrek and Fiona's love is tested and Shrek's faith in himself is pushed to its limits.  Shrek ends up in the dungeon and we meet The Muffin Man of Drury Lane (homage to Dr. Frankenstein).  All of this builds to a dramatic showdown with a very unexpected sacrifice.
Overall, it is a laugh a minute which reinforces the same morals in the first --- that appearance isn't everything.  It's an outstanding sequel and in my opinion, a must see!",1085788800,,1231,4.55
1490909,5,B00005JMQZ,"With a cast that includes John Cleese and Julie Andrews as Princess Fiona's royal parents, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, both Antonio Banderas AND Jennifer Saunders stealing the show as Puss-In-Boots and the Fairy Godmother, respectively, SHREK 2 actually manages to do the seemingly impossible: build on---and even improve upon---the original! Usually, the first in any film series is the best, being fresh & original; sequels almost never live up to the original story. However, SHREK 2 plays not like a sequel; it's really more of an extension of the wacky SHREK. It actually throws more at you this time around, and resultingly turns out to be a laugh-a-minute animated comedy that blows you away. It is startingly original, inventive, edgy, satirical, rude, crude, romantic, cute---all at the same time! Mike Myers still does an incredible job as the voice of Shrek, as does Eddie Murphy as the motormouth Donkey and, of course, Cameron Diaz as the feisty Princess Fiona. I couldn't count all the great lines there are in the film! Also, as visually stunning as the 3-D CGI animation was in the original, it is even more amazing this time around: for example, Prince Charming looks so real that you have to remind yourself that he's not CGI. SHREK 2 is a feast for the eyes, yet you don't even realize how much it is because you're too busy laughing at the hundreds of gags, of which I will not dare to reveal!
As with the original, this film is not appropriate for kids under the age of 8. As with the original, more than 20 million kids under the age of 8 will have seen this film by this time next year. That's just a fact of life, I guess! Already SHREK 2 is breaking box office records, most notably the coveted five-day-opening-weekend record, earning over $125 million. It will undoubtably end up with an over-half-billion-dollar take at the U.S. box office alone, easily surpassing that of the original. But really, it isn't all hype: SHREK 2 definitely earns its standing as the most anticipated movie sequel of the year. Add to that the best comedy of the year!

1490910,4,B00005JMQZ,"I, like the rest of America, was greatly looking forward to this movie, and had heard it was great from several friends - even better than the first. On the most part, the film rises to the challenge of matching the phenomenon that was the first Shrek movie. The same loveable characters are all here in the sequel, equally as funny. There are some new characters as well, most notably Puss `n Boots played hilariously by Antonio Banderas.
The movie starts exactly where the first one ended, with Shrek and Fionna getting married and heading off on their honeymoon. Right away Donkey (Eddie Murphy) enters the picture, just as Shrek and Fionna are summoned to the kingdom of Far, Far Away by her parents, played by John Cleese and Julie Andrews. The problem is that her parents don't know she's now a full-time Ogre, nor that she's married one.
From here, things comically unfold to bring Shrek, Fionna and Donkey into the kingdom, where Fionna's father decides to have Shrek assassinated. Enter Puss `n Boots, the kitten/assassin. I won't give any more away, but it continues to wind through the twisted, backwards fairy-tale world that made Shrek 1 so great.
While the same biting humor from the original is abundant here, so are some other things - like plot and moral. In a very similar way as the first movie, Shrek and Fionna misunderstand each other, and because of the confusion they are separated. And once again, Shrek gives up on her and Donkey convinces him to mount an impossible challenge to win her back. And yes, once again, we get the message that appearance isn't everything, and true love comes in every size and shape.
I felt that the great values subtly weaved into the original were not only exactly the same in Shrek 2, but also much more overt, almost to the point of preachiness. I really don't think children will enjoy this as much. I have twin 3-year olds who wore out the first DVD, but could barely sit through this one, given the abundance of adult themes and situations (by ""adult,"" I don't mean inappropriate, but incomprehensible to children).
Ultimately, you should not miss this one, but I felt that while still hilarious, it didn't quite live up to the genius of the first one (as sequels seldom do).",1085702400,19,2237,4.694656488549619
1490911,5,B00005JMQZ,"Having not watched Shrek before, I was worried that there would be some sort of continuation on Part 2 that would make me feel lost. However, my worries were unfounded.

Shrek 2 doesn't boost a mind-boggling storyline but instead, tells a simle story of love through life-like animation. You would be forgiven for thinking that you are watching real people on screen. The thing that makes the animated movie works is the voices behind the characters which absolutely bring the characters to life. Together with the string of songs and the brilliant fairy tale characters that light up the screen, Shrek 2 is both a delight to kids and adults.
Kids would be entertained by the spectacularly colorful visuals and the familiarity of fairy tales while adults would appreciate the finer theme of strong love and loving someone as the person is.",1085702400,3,839,4.908450704225352
1490912,5,B00005JMQZ,"The story begins somewhat where the last Shrek film left off, with a twist.
Get used to there being a twist...
The story begins with the recitation of another standard fairy tale opening, that one might think as an ending, where Prince Charming (charmingly voiced by Rupert Everett) dashes through incredible perils to reach the unfortunate-cursed princess, Fiona, as his kiss is the only thing that will break the curse.  The only problem here: when he arrives to kiss the fair princess, he is greeted by another story-book character who informs him she is on her honeymoon.
Honeymoon?
The stage is set for a frolic of fairy-tale proportions.  The main characters are back - Shrek (Mike Myers) in his typical ogre self (who knew ogres spoke with muddled Celtic accents?); Fiona, every inch the ogre herself night and day (reprised by Cameron Diaz - remember the tale from the first film where she was beautiful by day and hideous by night), is blissful on her honeymoon with Shrek.  They return home to be greeted by Donkey (once again the humourous Eddie Murphy), to almost immediately be summoned to Fiona's home by her parents, the king and queen, so that they may meet the husband (not quite the prince they were expecting) and be welcomed into the kingdom of Far, Far Away, which is, true to its word, far, far away (are we there yet? is the constant refrain during the journey).
It is quite delightful to imagine John Cleese and Julie Andrews as the king and queen; their characters do not imitate their features physically, but their standard screen personae come through their voices and characterisations.  Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, the scheming social climber, is very well done, with typical British fop panache.  However, there is no mistaking Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) as the Fairy Godmother (who, it turns out, is Prince Charming's mother, and given that it is Rupert Everett, well, enough said...) - the animation captures the twinkle in her eye and the sardonic smile as she holds the king to ransom for the secret that he hides (she once granted a wish to him, which is hinted at early on in the film - see if you can predict what it is!).
The king and queen are not surprisingly shocked to discover the ogre-ific state of their only daughter, not to mention the son-in-law; the king decides to do away with Shrek, hiring a hit man (in this instance, a hit cat), Puss-in-boots, voiced by an over-the-top Antonio Banderas.  Attacking with the grace of a cat, he is nonetheless thwarted in his charge by a nasty hairball, and joins with the quest to find Happily Ever After-effects with Shrek and Donkey.
There are some good songs here, remakes of popular songs sung with style that befits a fairy-tale, medieval recreation of Hollywood/Hollyweird.  Just as Fiona had her surprise chance to be an ogre in the first film, Shrek gets his chance to be drop-dead gorgeous in this film, by stealing the Fairy Godmother's potion for Happily Ever Afters.  Donkey shares in this potion and becomes a dashing stallion.  So, everyone will live happily ever after, right?
Right, but again, there's a twist (and I'm not going to tell you what it is).
There are lots of cameos - Larry King voices the ugly sister, and Joan Rivers voices her own characters as the red-carpet announcer at the royal banquet akin to the Oscar ceremonies.  There are one-liners galore, so many it is hard to recall them all - take a notebook with you to the cinema!
One of the trademarks of Shrek is its homage to various other films - try to make all the connections - Flashdance, Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters, you name it, it is satirised.  The same holds true for various fairy tales - the three blind mice, little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, even Pretty Woman!
The animation quality is superb, and shows just how astonishingly lifelike modern computer-generated graphics have become.  An interesting effect, rather like a cross between clay-mation types of physical movements and hand-drawn facial expressions, the type of animation here is approaching lifelike and realistic, again with the twist of being almost puppet-like, to fit the fairy-tale aspect of the film.
Stay through the credits!  Why people get up and leave the cinema as soon as the names start I shall never understand, but they missed out the bonus scene at the end, that is well worth the wait (Banderas, as Puss-in-boots, heading off for the Kit-Kat Club, begins the scene, and it just goes on from there).
This is a film for children of all ages, with enough humour for adults to keep them interested, and a classic tale, with modern twists, to delight all audiences.",1085616000,22,4657,4.80625

This is much better than Disney's ""Home on the Range"" and a good destination for a family night out.",1085529600,,1017,4.574585635359116
1490976,5,B00005JMQZ,"First, you start off with a dream cast: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Jennifer Saunders, and Rupert Everett.  Then, you put them in a movie sequel that - while maybe with not quite the same level of heart the first film had - is funny, well-written, action-packed, and with a good story to tell.
And that's how ""Shrek 2"" comes to be, on a different level, a sequel to equal its predecessor.  I literally can't remember when I've left a movie feeling this good, it's a film that deserved to break records, and hopefully will continue to do so.
The film opens right where the first one left off; Fiona and Shrek (Diaz and Myers) enjoy a blissful honeymoon ... after which they head home to the swamp, where they are reunited with Donkey (Murphy) -- it seems the romance between him and Dragon didn't work out.  Soon after they're arrival, the newlyweds are visited by messengers from the Kingdom of Far Far Away, who inform them that Princess Fiona and her husband, Prince Shrek, have been invited to Far Far Away for a celebration of their marriage, with a gala ball where the king and queen (Fiona's parents) will bestow their blessings on the marriage union.
Shrek, figuring correctly that Fiona's parent may not be thrilled with their daughter marrying an ogre -- much less that Fiona is now an ogre permanently herself -- allows himself to be talked into going to the kingdom by Fiona, who is absolutely sure her parents will not only accept her in her current form ... but will also accept her ogre husband, whom she dearly loves.
The trip back -- in a carriage shaped like a garlic bulb -- takes Shrek and Fiona and Donkey to a kingdom where the streets resemble a strip mall (Burger Prince, Tower of London Records, etc. -- it looks like Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, Disney-style).  When they get to the castle, they see that practically every loyal subject in the kingdom has gathered to celebrate the return of the long-lost princess.  But when the happy couple steps from the coach, a hush of shock falls over the crowd ... and sure enough, the reception on all levels is much closer to Shrek's vision than what Fiona had in mind.
Add a conniving Fairy Godmother (Saunders), who has her own plans for Shrek and Fiona, and is blackmailing the King (Cleese) into helping her ... a catsassin name Puss-in-Boots (Banderas) who is hired to ""take care of"" Shrek so the evil plan can unfold ... and a magic ""Happy Every After"" potion that must end in a kiss before midnight for it to take hold ... and you have a great sequel that is funny, adventurous, and will appeal to the young and old alike.
The animation is tops; classic as ""Shrek"" was, there have been still new advances in animation that make this film look even more amazing on the big screen.  The characters are all warm and human -- especially Shrek and Fiona of course -- but you'll get your best laughs from Donkey ... and especially from Puss, who has a secret weapon (when fighting off the guards in one scene) that may just have you falling off your seat with laughter.
While ""Shrek"" may be a more ""fully-rounded"" film, as some have said, there is not a single frame - or moment - wasted in this terrific sequel.  In some ways, I liked it even better than the first, and for Murphy and Banderas alone the L.Q. (Laugh Quotient) will make it worth even a second or third viewing in the theater (and a no-brainer to own on DVD).  Highly recommended, and I can't imagine anyone not liking this film -- unless you got a good bit of ogre in you, too.",1085529600,2,3574,4.513137557959815
1490977,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 is an awesome movie. To understand some of the brilliance of the movie you have to know a little about the executive producer of it. Jeffery Katzenberg is the head of the animation department at Dreamworks and he is the K in the SKG of Dreamworks. He is the former head of Disney's animation department and was there when Disney did Aladin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. He parodies those and more to perfection in this hit sequel movie.
Shrek 2 takes off right where Shrek left us. Shrek(Myers) and Fiona(Diaz) are on their honeymoon. They are the happily married ogre family and they return home to find Donkey(Murphy) waiting for them. After a brief argument on how they want to be alone a visitor arrives. They are from the land of Far Far Away and they have a message for Fiona. Her parents are requesting she come back home so her parents can bless her marriage.
They arrive in Far Far Away and things don't go as what King(Cleese) and Queen(Andrews) expected. They were hoping to see Fiona arrive with Prince Charming(Everett) instead of Shrek. After a fight at dinner between Shrek and King all hope for a loving family looks lost. King is very upset and so is Fairy Godmother(saunders). She had made a deal with the King for her son Charming to marry Fiona. She threatens the poor King to get rid of Shrek or else. The King goes on and hire Puss(Banderas) to go take out Shrek. In the mean time Shrek has realized his faults and is trying to save his marriage to Fiona and make her family realize he isn't all that bad.
The parodies in the movie are great. Especially all of the Disney ones. They parody the ones that Katzenberg worked on so much. You know he has to be laughing after watching the succes of this movie and then lookng at Disney who has struggled since Eisner canned him. They parody a ton of other notable movies and it's just good time at the moives.
Puss is a brilliant addition to the Shrek family. Banderas as the voice is great and I hope he is in the next two announced movies in this series.
Shrek2 is just as good as the first. All the same qualities that made one fun are back and you will fall in love again with it. This is a movie that any age can enjoy because of the brilliant writing and animation. Go take your family to see it and be ready for a good time.",1085529600,,2323,4.342528735632184

I think they did a very nice job on blending this movie so that it appealed to the masses on whole rather than just children.

It has a lot of jokes that adults will get & kids might not, but is still entertaining for kids, my youngest is 3 & sat through it & laughed. It is a good family movie that all can enjoy.

This is a bright, cheerful film with great CGI and plenty of laughs.  The character of Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) nearly steals the show.  Though not quite the equal of the original film, this is a really fun movie with excellent voice talent and amusing characters.  The soundtrack of popular music becomes a bit overwhelming at times, but not enough to detract from the overall experience.",1085443200,,708,4.92436974789916

The brilliant cast is impeccable and the addition of Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots is beyond all the adjectives you know.  He is hilarious and cat lovers will love it.  Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother is wonderful.  Julie Andrews and John Cleese, as Queen and King, Fiona's parents,  are perfect together.  I only saw the movie May 22nd and haven't stopped talking about it.  I've gone to all of my co-workers to tell them they must see the movie.

1490982,5,B00005JMQZ,I took the liberty of going to see Shrek 2 yesterday with the intention of already knowing it would be better than the first one. It is much better and I have to say that Puss n Boots was even better than Donkey by a slim margin. I could even sense a little jealousy in that lovable loudmouth when Shrek started paling around with the adorable Zorro-like feline. I thought that Julie Andrews and John Cleese were great in their roles as Fiona's parents. Prince anything but Charming and the un-Fairy Godmother (pardon the insults) couldn't be trusted any farther than they could be thrown. I can say that I would see this movie a second and possible third time and am looking forward to when Shrek 2 comes out on DVD.,1085356800,3,717,4.4393939393939394
1490983,5,B00005JMQZ,"Shrek 2 lives up to the humor and originality of Shrek 1!!
This movie picks up with Shrek & Princess Fiona on their honeymoon, which is more than over when they are invited to meet Fiona's parents, the King & Queen of Far, Far Away.  You see, Fiona's parents are expecting the beautifully thin Fiona to arrive with Prince Charming, who was supposed to rescue her from the dragon~not a couple of Ogres.  Prince Charming is the son of the Fairy Godmother, whom the King struck a deal with a long, long time ago. Only Shrek rescued Fiona before Charming could get there.
Along comes Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas in a sort-of recreation of his character in Zorro.  Cat lovers will especially appreciate Puss's kitty antics and big, loveable eyes!  Puss is hired by the King to do away with Shrek.  However, Shrek wins over Puss, and Puss decides to help Shrek win Fiona's heart all over again.
The talks-too-much Donkey, voiced again by Eddie Murphy, is along for the trip and adequately states, ""The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken"" jealously to Puss.  I must admit, Puss steals a few scenes away from Shrek, but the laughs are all over the place!
The ""fairytale things"" are back, but not as much as in the first Shrek. There are numerous ""inside jokes"" all over the place, and I'm sure it will take a few viewings to find them all, as it did with the first!  There is a place where Cameron Diaz's real life boyfriend, Justin Timberlake shows up in a photo of Sir Justin - Keep your eyes open!~The funny reference's are everywhere!!
Don't leave your seat too early!! The credits may start to roll, but there IS more to come! Sit back & relax while everyone else trys to leave the packed theater ~ and catch up on Donkey's love life!
Kids and adults alike will thoroughly enjoy this one! I give this my highest ranking, along with the first!!",1085270400,3,1878,4.538461538461538
1491043,5,B00005JMQZ,"Let me be up front with this, I did not like Shrek.  To me, the flatulence humor made it unfit for children, and other than that it was a one-note production, the running gag of the Disney bashing got real old, real fast.
But while this movie does continue the flatulence humor, it soft pedals (not eliminates) the Disney bashing, and gives us better production values, a more complex story, more developed characters, and a show stopper of a musical number (ironic, as it provides the soundtrack for the climatic action sequence).  Pop culture reference come faster than you can count, but they are genuinely funny.
Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders make this show, and I personally would be more interested in a Puss In Boots spinoff than a Shrek 3.  John Cleese is perfect as the King, the real hero of this piece, willing to sacrifice his Happily Ever After so that his daughter could have hers.
Again, I'm not sure this is appropriate for pre-teens, but teens and adults are in for a good time.",1085270400,,1004,4.661016949152542
1491044,4,B00005JMQZ,"The movie Shrek taught us all to be ourselves, and that it is what is on the inside that matters, not the outside.  It also taught us that ogres are like onions, not cake.  And that one person's annoying talking donkey is another person's comedic treasure.  Yeah, Shrek was a very funny movie with a very deep and meaningful lesson.  In Shrek 2, we get some old gags, plenty of new gags, and the same old message.  Ok, so now Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are back from their honeymoon, but they find that Donkey (Eddie Murphy) isn't the only person waiting them for them.  Fiona's parents, Herald (John Cleese) and Lilian (Julie Andrews), who are the King and Queen of a kingdom called Far, Far Away, have summoned the newlyweds to the kingdom to be the royal guests of honor at a wedding ball.  However, upon their arrival, they are immediately shunned by the people of Hollywood, I mean Far, Far Away.  Let's not forget that Shrek and Fiona are ogres, and Donkey is an annoying talking animal.  Anyway, Fiona is visited by a sleazy Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who tries to convince her to be ""happy"", or marry her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett).  Fiona declines because she loves Shrek.  Meanwhile, it turns out King Harold and Fairy Godmother have some secret pact, which, if not honored, will have dire consequences for the royal family.  Anyway, Shrek, feeling rejected by Fiona, takes a ""Happily Ever After"" potion which turns Shrek and Donkey ""sexy"".  Soon, Fiona is forced to choose between the old and the new Shrek.
The whole potion bit is a metaphor for plastic surgery, or something related.  After all, Far, Far Away is very Hollywoodish, and in Tinsel Town, looking good is everything, even if it doesn't mean feeling good.  Anyway, this was a very funny movie.  There were some original jokes, some jokes from the first movie, and some film spoofs, such as Spider-Man, Mission: Impossible, and E.T.  Once again, the Shrek/Donkey duo generated a lot of laughs, but the real scene stealer was the new Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas).  Finally, I was a little disappointed not to see some sort of cameo from Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who was a great character from the first film who got too little screen time.  Anyway, this movie, while it is a bit of an echo of the first film, but it is still worth seeing.",1085270400,,2357,4.677184466019417
1491045,5,B00005JMQZ,"This is a great film, full of laughs and beautiful animation.  I only recently saw the first film and I enjoyed it too.  I think, however, that this one is better.  Mike Myers returns as the loveable but grumpy Shrek, as does his love, Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and his sidekick, Donkey (Eddie Murphy). New additions include John Cleese and Julie Andrews as Fiona's royal parents; Jennifer Saunders, as a very wicked Fairy God Mother and Rupert Everett as a vain Prince Charming.  But the newest member of this fairy tale that is the most fun is Puss in Boots, played slyly by Antonio Banderas, clearly a scene stealer!
The story starts after Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon,  the two receive a summons from Fiona's parents to welcome her new husband into the family and celebrate the wedding with a ball.  Once the King and Queen see Fiona and her husband, though, is when the story gets set in motion.
The writers had a lot of fun getting laughs out of Hollywood, paroding Cops, E news with Joan Rivers and Mission Impossible as well as taking a few funny jabs at animating rival, Disney. I'm sure I need to see it again to catch all the sight gags.  Also, stay around for a little bit of the credits because there is a little extra bit of fun after the movie is over.
A great film that the whole family can enjoy.  I highly recommend it!",1085270400,5,1331,4.448559670781893

All of the voice talents were great including the newcomers John Cleese, Antonio Banderas, and Julie Andrews.  The animation had definately improved.

1491048,5,B00005JMQZ,"I expected great things from this movie--ie, an hour and a half's worth of laughs, but I never expected it to literally surpass its predecessor! Shrek 2 is an original story; unlike so many animated sequels, it doesn't lack plot or energy. Oh, did I mention energy? This movie explodes with it. My entire family came away after laughing out loud--genuine, unforced laughter that filled the theater because everyone was adding to it--with the impression that scores of very funny little jokes had been stuffed into about twenty minutes at the end of this film, where the clever and fast-paced conclusion played out. Fiona's parents, Fairy godmother, and Puss in Boots play vital roles in the story...as does a giant Gingerbread man. The film is abundant with humor and with heart. Fans of the original will not walk away disappointed. It felt good to hear a huge theater filled with people say, ""Awwww!"" when Puss gave his lovable, beseeching big-watery-eyed stare, or when the adorable Bichon Frise puppy cowered under Shrek's rage when he lost his temper with Fiona. The transformation of Donkey into a beautiful white steed was both fun and funny. The King, Harold, voiced by John Cleese, was a terrific new asset to the film, and provided much of the substance (and, again, the humor; the cross dressing bartender at the Poison Apple tries to dance with 'Prince Charming' in the final dancing scene.) Overall it's a fantastic achievement that leaves you feeling quite good.",1085270400,2,1476,4.955645161290323
1491049,4,B00005JMQZ,"This sequel was loaded with chuckles and spoofs covering everything from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills to COPS (KNIGHTS) to the giant Sta-Puff Man in Ghostbusters (only here, it's the giant Gingerbread Man). In a theatre filled with kids, it was the adults that were laughing the loudest. Not to say that there weren't chuckles for kids too, but it was definitely also geared toward the beer-belly laugh crowd.
Shrek and Donkey's new cohort Puss N Boots is a real hoot as is Prince Charming. The animation and writing team on this movie must have had a great time working this one up.
I might have given it 5 stars, but the guy sitting behind me was laughing so loud, that I frequently only caught the first part of a joke before he'd start laughing and overpower the audio. Go see it. Fun for kids AND adults.",1085270400,9,809,4.510204081632653
1491050,3,B00005JMQZ,"Far far away, there is a kingdom called Far Far Away.  This just happens to be where Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz)is from and must return.  The film picks up with Fiona and Shrek (Mike Myers) on their honeymoon.  Yes, the loveable Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is back as well.  The honeymoon is spoiled when we learn that Shrek needs to meet the parents.  John Clease provides the voice of Fiona's father and provides much of the controversy.  He is a good character, especially during a night at the dinner table.
This controversy is that he had promised the Fairy Godmother that Fiona would be married to Prince Charming, Godmother's son.  The agreement was broken when Shrek rescued Fiona instead of Charming rescuing her.  Thus, little plot twists and mix-ups (some that include potions, mistaken identities, and good vs evil) cause chaos among the marriage.
Along the way, Shrek meets the star of the movie.  A muskateer-like fighting feline named Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas).  Puss In Boots provides most of the laughs in the film.  Originally, he was hired to eliminate Shrek to allow Charming to have Fiona for himself, but he gains respect for Shrek after a little scuffle, and they become good friends.  Apparently, Shrek didn't know that the charming kitty stole the show from him.
Some of the minor characters return to the sequel.  They are merely here for fairy tell references and to help make a rescue attempt at the end.  One of the most memorable of these is Pinnochio who provides a couple of good laughs in this film.
One of the cutest moments happens after the film.  Be sure to stay during the credits because after a couple minutes into the credits, a short scene comes on that makes people laugh and say ""aww.""  Most people had left before this appeared, be sure not to miss it.
Shrek 2 is not nearly as good as the first.  In fact, if it had not been for additional characters like Puss In Boots and the King (Fiona's father), the movie would not have as many laughs as it did.  The first film was new, clever, and fun to watch as many fairy tale references and characters appeared on screen.  This film lacks that kind of magic.  When doing Shrek 3 and they ask Puss In Boots if he will come back, hopefully he will say, ""For you baby, I could be.""",1085184000,,2272,4.576732673267327
1491051,4,B00005JMQZ,"I was skeptical when I first heard there was a sequel being made to Shrek. I thought what made the first movie so great was its originality and how it parodied so many things. Often movies built on such things rarely make good sequels (Scary Movie, Airplane 2, etc).
This time though I was very surprised. The original characters are back with all their flare, which means Donkey steals alot of the show. Antonio Banderas is suprisingly good as Puss in Boots, and Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother is just Absolutely Fabulous (pun intended.)
If you liked the first movie, you will definately like this sequel. If you didn't like the first one.... well I don't know what to tell ya. If a little toilet humor and parodies of what was thought not to be parodied offends you, then this movie won't change your feelings.
Just to ""warn"" you all, there is actually SINGING in this movie, but it's done by Saunders, who is a surprisingly good singer (assuming it's her actually doing all the singing.) Also, the songs aren't that long either, so if you hate Disney flicks because of their songs, no need to fear.
After a while you forget you're watching an ""animated"" movie and just accept it for what it is: A great comedy with a terrific cast. It's obvious that the creators of this were not just trying to rest of their laurels and let the title sell itself. Instead, they lure you in with more Shrek, and leave you with more and more laughs. Whether you're 6, 16, 36 or 86, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.

1491052,5,B00005JMQZ,"STORY: This fairy tale satire continues right from the first movie as Shrek and Fiona are on their honeymoon. Prince Charming finally reaches the castle only to find the ""gender confused"" big bad wolf reading Pork Illustrated. The movie is basically focusing on the self awareness of who Shrek and Fiona really are. The fairy godmother of Fiona and the mother of Charming is out to make sure that Fiona falls in love with Charming and not Shrek. As Shrek is lost in the woods he stumbles upon the masterfully crafted character that is Puss In Boots. Puss is probably one of the greatest fictional characters of all time, he is played to perfection by Antonio Banderas. The first Shrek was a slight satire on the fairy tale genre. Shrek 2 is an unbelievable high on satirical parody (if that makes sense). The pop culture references come flying in one after the other. I really feel that any body under 12 will not get most of the jokes made in this movie. For the kids we have the farting and the burping and for the more learned individual we have references to gender confused wolves, cats on catnip, meeting the in-laws, crazy wooden boys with strange fetishes, the ass, and tons more. There is no way that anybody cannot watch this movie and not laugh. If you need to compare Shrek 2 to something look at it as a lighter version of a Family Guy, Airplane, or Hot Shots type of thing. While the references are not as exaggerated as they are in parodies such as Hot Shots, they are very well placed and well executed. While many people feel that the story and the ""heart"" that the first movie had was lost within the many gags there is still that ""heart"" that the characters possess. Yes, the ending is your typical fairy tale ending that has a valuable moral, but then again this is a fairy tale. This movie is smart, funny, and overall a well-crafted piece of work.

 ACTING: All the former cast members return as well as the noticeable additions of John Cleese, Julie Andrews, and Antonio Banderas. I can't express just how funny Puss In Boots is. Without Puss the movie would without a doubt have been really boring and ""kiddyish"" if you will. The most humorous jokes are deployed in the film's ending which is a hysterical romp. John Cleese plays the enraged father and Julie Andrews as the accepting mother. Prince Charming is played by Rupert Everett, and really his only funny scene was when they stopped by drive thru and he got a kiddie meal and was wearing one of those paper crowns as found in burger king. The cast makes the film, Puss makes the film.

 BOTTOM LINE: The kids will not find this one funny except for the small amount of fart gags. The people who will find this the most amusing will be in the range of 15 to about 50. Anything above 50 might find any kind of animation too childish and will probably stay away from this one unless they have young kids. The animation by Dreamworks is fantastic as well, make note of the scene in the rain and just how realistic the natural surroundings look. Shrek 2 is faster and funnier than the original and should become a classic just because of how smart the movie is.",1085097600,37,3138,4.490367775831874

1491068,4,B00005JMQZ,"I just saw ""Shrek 2"" and left feeling vaguely let down. There could be several reasons for this that had nothing to do with the film. For one thing, I saw a non-opening day weekday matinee, so there was very small audience - not good for a comedy. For another, I simply wasn't in the greatest of moods.
Still, after ruminating on it for a while, I have decided that it really didn't impress me as much as the original. The original ""Shrek"" had the benefit of surprise and discovery, which any sequel will lack. Still the humor was well executed with every bit as much detail as the original, so why wasn't I more impressed? I can think of several possibilities which I'll detail below. Overall, I can recommend it, though. Oh, and by all means, stay for the credits!!!
[WARNING - Potential spoilers from here on]
1. ""Shrek 2"" is self-consciously more hip than the original. The original has lots of contemporary references, to be sure, but not so many as to make it inaccessible to audiences some number of decades in the future. This one did and it detracted from the impact.
2. The plot line having Shrek and Fiona both made human just seemed wrong. Granted, this was a goal - to show the folly of trying to be something you're not - but still, a human Shrek just didn't deliver the goods the way the ogre Shrek could have.
3. The big surprises at the end were obvious from very early in the film. Granted that big surprise ending in ""Shrek"" was also somewhat predictable, but still I saw of the revelations coming from a mile away, as will I expect most viewers.
4. ""Shrek"" resisted the feature-length cartoon urge to include musical numbers. ""Shrek 2"" gives in and the results are mixed, at best.
Now that I've got the carping out of the way, I still admit that, on balance, it was pretty good. I mean, I didn't leaving wanting my money or time back. Some of the best gags are subtle and take place in the periphery of the main action (check out the label on the love potion). The cast and animators did their typically superb job. I can hardly wait to see what extras will appear on the DVD version...",1085097600,,2106,4.416452442159383
1491069,5,B00005JMQZ,"I took my 88 year old mother to see Shrek 2 today and we both loved it.  I liked it even better than the first Shrek.  The Fairy Godmother was a hoot....the ""ass"" was a riot...and the little Puss N Boots character was charming.  The music was great....the graphics were much better than the first Shrek.  I don't know how they did it, but it was more true to life.  I would really recommend it to anyone...a bit on the colorful side for some little tiny ones, but I would take MY grandkids.",1085011200,4,490,4.225806451612903
1491070,4,B00005JMQZ,"Alright before we start off, no I didn't appreciate this movie as much as I loved the first one, but that doesn't mean that the movie isn't still hilarious.
The story you can find around all of the other reviews, plus if I gave you too much details I would spoil some of the story, not that the story itself is earth-shattering but I know I myself don't like it when I head into a movie already knowing what is going to happen when I watch it for the first time.
Now onto the details, the animation as you have come to expect from the Shrek franchise is absolutely flawless, every scene is more gorgeous than the next, beautiful fireworks, superb colors and it's all set in a bit more of a light atmosphere than the first one was.
To me the high-light of the movie was s toss-up between ""Puss-in-boots"" the character whose voice was given birth by Antonio Banderas, I personally believed that this character was the highlight of the movie. The other highlight of course was Donkey, the wise-cracking-annoying as hell creature voiced by Eddie Murphy.
Is it as good as the first one? I personally didn't believe so seeing as they had to make a  bit more of a story this time (last one was just cracking jokes with a little bit of a story in the background, this time we already know the characters so they actually have to give us something else to entertain us)
So even though maybe not as good as the first one its still an hilarious movie, definitely worth watching for all ages because there are jokes in there that entertain everyone, and jokes that only the adults in the audience will get, especially the joke involving Pinocchio is hilarious (you'll know it when you see it). Absolutely worth watching.",1085011200,,1708,4.509677419354839
1491071,4,B00005JMQZ,"Fun, new Shrek with witty dialogue, goofy takes on classic rock songs, and enough sight-jokes to drive you happily nuts. Added voices Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, & John Cleese join originals Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, & Eddie Murphy.  Some of the animation lacked the TLC so visable in Shrek 1, but, over-all, Shrek 2 is a super-sequel.",1085011200,,340,4.964912280701754
1491072,4,B00005JMQZ,"I saw  Shrek 2 today and it's  funnier than the original. If you thought the first was inappriote for kids you'll feel the same about this one, maybe more so even. Only if you think fart jokes aren't appropiate. Oh plus Pinochio wears women underwear lol. Otherwise they could see worse on tv. Most the cartoon shows they watch these days are pretty violent, so what's worse for them fart jokes or violence ?
  Anyway adults should find it hilarious though and most jokes might even go over the heads of little kids. In some reviews I see critics saying it doesn't have the heart of the original. It has less than the original but still there's heart but it's all at the end. It's longer and slower than the original but the end is when it really comes to life. Plus you have to love Antonio Banderas  as Puss in Boots, he totally steals the show. Someone here gave it 1 star for bad voice casting. You can't say that after you actually see the movie though. I missed John Lithgow's Lord Farqard though but other than that Shrek 2 is loads of fun.",1084924800,,1047,4.348717948717948
