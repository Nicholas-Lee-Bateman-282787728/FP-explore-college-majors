8197937,5,B000QXDCTW,"Not having read the novel of the same title on which this film is based, I thoroughly expected this film to be a teen farce, given the potentially absurd problem that bedevils the 17-years-old protagonist. I half-way expected it perhaps to form a cinematic trilogy about icky teen problems, along the lines of ""Thumbsucker"" + ""Nosepicker"" + ""Buttscratcher"".  I was envisaging ""Thumbsucker"" to be akin to John Waters` ""Cry Baby"" or ""Pecker"", or, on another hand, that wonderful pair of Bill & Ted movies of yore which Keanu Reeves (the New Age dentist in ""Thumbsucker"") made with Alex Winter, something along that line.

The film is not that at all, but rather an endearing ""coming of age"" story of how an adolescent male transitioning from high school years to university overcomes the childhood regressive trait of the film`s title and, more significantly, a lot of other personal problems much more important than mere thumbsucking, gaining focus and self-assurance to realise his personal hopes and ambitions. The dentist, too, Keanu Reeves' character, comes to terms with his human limitations and grows on his own path in life, as do most of the personages in the movie. The film, indeed, is amusing in parts, no doubt of it, but humour, i.e. to amuse the viewer at the characters' expense, is not, per se the goal of the film. Acquiring and seeing this motion picture (and the special features included), however, should be the goal of as many film lovers as the DVD deserves!",1331337600,,1482,4.900398406374502
