2825573,5,B000PMG11K,I love this DVD! I bought this for my kids in Children's Church! The kids  are able to learn the songs from reading the captions. This DVD is a wonderful tool to use to get kids excited about Praise & Worship!,1237939200,5,209,4.097560975609756

8192490,3,B000PMG11K,"The music is good, however the video quality seems to be lacking compared to the other 2 Shout Praises Kids DVDs I have. There are also no on-screen lyrics, which means I won't be able to use it for kids to sing along in Sunday school. That being the reason I purchased this, makes it a total fail.",1496534400,,298,4.155172413793103

8192493,3,B000PMG11K,This is to difficult for kids to follow.,1443916800,,40,4.125
8192494,5,B000PMG11K,Kids loved it!!!! The videos were on replay so much that I tried to hide the dvd,1428624000,,80,3.764705882352941
8192495,5,B000PMG11K,It's good for kids.  The Children's Church seem to enjoy it.,1408579200,,60,4.454545454545454
8192496,4,B000PMG11K,"This is one of the poorer quality video production of the Shout Praises Kids but the upbeat song selections and the vibrant graphics far out weight this imperfection. And what I mean by quality of video is you see lots of pixelation in the video quality.  Will kids really care about this???... probably not.  What I really like about this praise DVD is high energy songs featuring kids praising the Lord, dancing about to the music and having an all around joyous time. The songs are easy to sing with and not very ""wordy"".  This DVD has the option to add the words to the video or leave them off. Recommend highly for children's church or middle aged youth.  Not for teenagers, they will be bored with this.",1395014400,6,709,4.515625
8192497,5,B000PMG11K,I bought this in addition to the others I have for the Children's Ministry I volunteer with mostly because it was a GREAT buy! Shipping was very quick and the items was unopened in perfect condition. Very happy with this buy!,1362355200,2,225,4.512195121951219
8192498,5,B000PMG11K,"I love it & so does my little kids from MDO ....

This DVD has the words to the songs and that is very helpful for children to
learn & recognized words of a song they are singing.

Thanks a bunch !!",1356480000,2,198,3.6904761904761907
