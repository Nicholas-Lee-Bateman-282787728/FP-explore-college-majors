7827371,2,6302518318,"What we have here is action director Isaac Florentine's practice piece; a rudimentary martial arts film which, while competent in its time, comes off nowadays as early career training for the man who'd later rock movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>.

It has its moments, but even completists will have to acknowledge that there's a good reason why this one never made it to DVD.

The story: retired Native American policeman/kickboxer Joe Nighthawk (Newton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive/dp/B000065V40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive</a>) must rekindle his fighting spirit when he becomes the protector of a brother and sister (Judie Aronson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>) fleeing from a ruthless drug lord (Paul Smith,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/B000ZM1MGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>).

John Newton has enough cool-looking kicks to fool me into believing he's a martial artist, but he's hardly passable as a Native American. His acting is merely decent, but he still feels underutilized: physically, he could've been Van Damme, and thematically, he could've been an original hero, but I'm afraid the script just doesn't take advantage or make much of an effort in general. Halfway through the film, there's a cool scene wherein Joe saves his quarry from a motorcycle trio led by a perverse preacher, but just about everything else he does is standard lone wolf fare and isn't very cool. This is especially disappointing when considering that he's the most interesting and talented performer in the group: Paul Smith is a bland gangster in an ice cream suit and Judie Aronson deserves a spanking for the shallowness of her acting. Henchman Michael Foley - whom Florentine would direct to consistently better results throughout ""WMAC Masters"" - is made out to be intimidating but his overly soft voice kills his performance. Bill Manard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trancers/dp/6305741352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trancers</a>) gets an unexpected twist in his role as the sheriff, but don't count on his supporting performance to save the movie.

In light of this, we action fans hope for at least an ample serving of martial arts scenes, but even here Florentine was still pupating. As mentioned, I don't know if John Newton is a martial artist in real life but even if not, he's deceptively good at delivering the kicks. The problem is that he only has three fights of substance to show them off in and these encounters are generally one-sided and so mucked about with slow motion that the decency of the choreography is negated. The only brawl to stimulate any sort of real interest is the final showdown between Newton and Michael Foley, both of whom get to throw more cool kicks but are so poorly filmed that it's obvious no actual contact is ever made. Other than that, a promising shoot & stalk between Joe and the drug dealer's minions is ruined by having all the killing arrows shot from off-screen with Newton not making an appearance; it's as though the cast was being attacked by the prop department.

Production values are respectable: despite being filmed in the desert, the film escapes the general B-movie look of desperation with decent cinematography and the occasional nice hillside shot. It's not enough to make the film worthwhile, but it allows you to walk away from the movie with your dignity intact, albeit 90 minutes of your life wasted. If you absolutely need to get the full scoop on Isaac Florentine's filmography, this one's cheap enough to buy, but for the love of god, don't use it to introduce yourself or anyone else to the director's unique style of moviemaking; it wasn't quite developed yet.",1294012800,2,4674,6.264385692068429
7827372,3,6302518318,"Most of these kung fu/martial arts films are very similar:  a loner hero who gets the poop kicked out of him enough to show he's not superman; vile villains who have little acting ability; endangered damsels and often times they have a sidekick who's either incredibly stupid or in this case, a mildly retarded brother.  Drugs are usually involved, and the hero gets to show off his muscles by doing kung fu dances with appropriately inappropriate music.

In DESERT KICKBOXER, we have unknown John Haymes Newton in the role of Hawk, a half breed who killed a competitor in a weekend kickboxing match.  Hawk quits his job as a policeman and returns to his native Arizona land, becoming a reluctant deputy for Sheriff Larry (Biff Mardin).  Larry seeks Hawk's help in busting up the drug empire of Santos (played with Orson Welleish aplomb) by veteran character actor Paul L. Smith.  Smith's head henchman is a kickboxer named Bruno, who is played by stuntman Michael Foley.  Santos' accountant, Claudia (Judie Aronson, in a professional performance), has stolen 20 million dollars from Santos and is on the run with her mildly retarded brother, Anthony (played well by Sam DeFrancisco).  Hawk ends up on the run with these two, and all hell breaks loose.

No surprises, no real major cinematic achievements, but there is a sense of honor and loyalty, and the brother/sister/Hawk relationship seems sincere.

If you like this kind of movie, you can do much worse.",1091145600,7,1460,4.922448979591837
