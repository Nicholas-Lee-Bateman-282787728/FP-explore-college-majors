1379550,5,B00004Z1FO,"Dirty pictures in no way follows in the foot steps of The People vs. Larry Flint. This movie is primarily from the perspective of a midwest gallery curator who had brought in a touring exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's work. The movie is interlaced with interviews of people who had worked with or had known Mapplethorpe as well as images of his photographic works.
This is an Excellent purchase that raises questions in the mind of the veiwer. It is entertaining and to an extent educational on the art of Mapplethorpe, constitutional rights, and how people judge art based on ""Their Values and Tastes.""",1045353600,,603,4.864077669902913

1379553,4,B00004Z1FO,"An interesting blend of stock footage and filmed, this is the fascinating true story of the Cincinnati art director who defied everyone and everything to show the controversial photography of Maplethorpe.  As a person who was living in Cincinnati at the time of the trial's conclusion, I must say this film did capture the essence of the city's reaction.  A Jeckyl/Hyde town, Cincinnati is staunchly conservitive during it's sheriff Simon Leis ruled days; but turns into ""Sin""-cinatti at night, a liberal artistic town.  These two sides clashed vehemently over the Maplethorpe issue, in fact, it is still a hot topic, 10 years later.  The film is an important one in that it reminds us that we must continue to uphold our freedoms and rights, especially the freedom of expression.  We all have a right to our own art, and we all have a right to chose what to view; we do not have a right to dictate to others what is and is not art or a viable expression.  That is what this film is about.",970531200,16,989,4.590909090909091

7927874,5,B00004Z1FO,"Five stars is NOT because it's the greatest movie ever made. But it is a well told, truthful tale about an important modern problem: the head-on collision between conservative belief systems and enlightened political ideals. It's best summed up by a famous quotation attributed to Voltaire: ""I disapprove of what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" The issue in Dirty Pictures is the exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe at the Cincinnati art museum. The famous Washington DC museum, the Corcoran, had already been forced to retract its decision to show the exhibition. As with any good story, there is a surprise ending. The conservatives lose the battle, but win the war. So many lives are affected negatively by the publicity and social pressure surrounding the issue that most museums will not exhibit the photographs for fear of ""controversy."" Over the years, I've watched this HBO film many times, especially when conservative activists (in any culture or country) start forcing their Utopian vision on the world. It stiffens my backbone, but isn't preachy. It is a well told story, the type that educates while it is entertaining.",1356480000,,1174,5.056701030927835

7927876,3,B00004Z1FO,"An interesting perspective on ""What Is"" art and free speech. While I may or may not agree with the photographs depicted and do not know how historically accurate the movie is, it does give pause for thought on ones views of the constitution and community standards.",1291161600,,265,4.782608695652174
