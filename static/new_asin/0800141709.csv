166238,5,0800141709,"In response to the reviewer who gave this movie 2 stars on December 6, 1998, I have to say, your a moron. Dr. Stranglove should be appreciated for the movie, and the movie alone. Not the ""special features"" it  left out. This movie is one of the funniest ever made. Kubrick once again  proves that he is the greatest living film maker. This movie will have  anybody who can understand it laughing at George C. Scott's incredible  performance one moment, and pondering its dramatic social commentary the  next. Aside from its sharp tongued dialogue, this movie explores the  abillity and maturity of the leaders we put in charge. A classic in the  greatest sense of the word.",920160000,,673,4.700854700854701
166239,5,0800141709,"""Dr Strangelove or:How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" may be the only comedy ever made about neculear war. This 1962 satire of Cold War politics is witty and sharp, and is almost as funny as it was insightful.  If you are left of center in your politics it is espitially entertaining. It savagely attacks the Cold Warrior mentality and makes a statement about the arms race in a way you proably would not expect from a movie of it's era, while staying light and funny.
An Air Force general, convinced that his impotence is due to a commie plot to make americans weak and impure (the flouridation of water), decides to put together his own first strike so the US will have to follow and wipe out the Russians.  The movie chronicles the President (Sellars), the General's Brittish aide (Sellars) and others try to stop the destruction of the world.  Other charachters include a twisted Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove (Sellars), the bomber crew (including James Earl Jones and Slim Pickens), and the archetypical Cold Warrior (Scott) who advises the president it is all a great idea.
I could write a hundred pages and not convey how much this is worth seeing. If you like good black comedy, if you think the Cold War was absurd, or if you just like good films, this is a classic and should not be missed.  Hope you love it!
Peter Sellars plays 3 parts.  George C Sott and James Earl Joenes are in it.  Stanley Kubrick directed it... can't miss...  END",899078400,,1464,4.586206896551724

166251,5,0800141709,"There is good reason to regard Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) as Stanley Kubricks most perfectly realized film. Made at the crossroads of his career, it is the work which carries through to its fullest extent his perception (germinating through The Killing, Paths of Glory and Lolita) of mechanical man trapping himself within machines of his own making. It is also the film that announces the metaphysical tenor that will be expressed in texts (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon) which will be increasingly open and speculative. In many ways Dr. Strangelove is a classic Kubrick text, but in one sense it is crucially atypical. An achingly funny, tightly structured Swiftian satire, it is the only Kubrick film that communicates so compellingly and so insistently through the spoken word as opposed to his usual insistence on ideas expressing themselves through conceptual cinematography. It relies on a brilliant script (Terry Southern giving terrific satiric bite to Kubrick and Peter Georges adaptation of the latters originally very serious novel Red Alert), and a cluster of absolutely marvelous performances which involved a lot of improvisation and necessitated a great deal of temporal re-jigging at the editing stage by Kubrick and his editor Anthony Harvey. The anarchic nature of Dr. Strangeloves satire necessitated a kind of on the spur of the moment inspiration as every day of shooting involved constant re-writing with great emphasis laid on collaboration between all the artists concerned. In a usual Kubrick film its fair comment to say actors simply do as they are told and the success of their performances comes down to casting, script and direction, but here in addition to the script and Kubricks overall worldview, any analysis has to take into account the amazing acting which is crucial for getting the wicked humor across. What follows contains spoilers. Dont read if you haven't seen.

As everyone surely knows Dr. Strangelove is the film which made people laugh at thermonuclear global destruction. In 1963 this was outrageous as well as timely for Kubrick here cashes in on the post-World War 2 nuclear paranoia which had just recently flared up in Cuba. Stanley Kramers On the Beach and Sidney Lumets Fail Safe were earnest, respectable films made on the same subject which treated it with appropriate gravity. But Kubrick and producer James B. Harris realized nuclear threat could be even scarier if treated irreverently and in Swiftian dead-pan satiric fashion. Like Jonathan Swifts A Modest Proposal (1729) their film would be a Juvenalian satire with a clear point of attack. Swift suggested the poor Irish peasants might ease their suffering by selling their children as food to rich English absentee landlords and ladies. His target of attack was the rationalistic thinking of the English establishment at the expense of traditional human values. Likewise Kubrick attacks the rationalist thinking of the American military establishment who also disregard human values. He suggests the nuclear defense system is so full-proof, so cast-iron safe and so reliable that it only wants one man in a senior position to make a mistake and the whole system will be compromised, and further to that, the various safeguards and failsafe mechanisms are so efficient that they ensure an unstoppable chain reaction which ends in inevitable nuclear annihilation.

The American military establishment is one of Kubricks machines in which mechanical man entraps himself and the director breaks it down into three locations  the War Room in the Pentagon containing President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his chiefs of staff, the office and the grounds of Burpelson Air Force Base containing base commander Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who presides over the SAC 843rd Bomb Wing which is air-born constantly, and the inside of a B-52 bomber piloted by Major T. J. King Kong (Slim Pickens) and stationed 2 hours away from their target in Russia. All characters are mere cogs in the human machine. As per the satiric remit we learn nothing personal about anyone, everyone being extensions of their immediate machines which all interlock at a higher level. Ripper is the cog who fails and causes everyone else to fail in a series of events spun on mechanical inevitability. He goes a little funny in the head and orders his planes to attack Russia under the provisions of Wing Attack Plan R, the plan authorizing an officer to order an attack if the chain of command from the President has been disrupted. The crew of the B-52 assume America has already been hit by Russian nuclear missiles, seal off all communication to the plane, and concentrate on reaching their target. Ripper orders his airbase be sealed off and protected from any intruding force. Kubrick spends the whole narrative cutting between these 3 locations, each of which is isolated. Not only can each location not communicate with the other, but the characters within each location also cannot communicate with each other. As so often in Kubrick people talk without saying anything. There is no normal dialogue in the film as the English language is laundered of meaning and given 3 brands of inarticulacy. At Burpelson we have lunatic ravings as Ripper rambles incoherently to his executive officer Mandrake (Peter Sellers again) about the Commie conspiracy, purity of essence and bodily fluids. On the B-52 we have an endless stream of military jargon as the crew do what they have to do to dodge a missile and continue to their target. They are very obviously mechanical extensions of the very machine they are flying. And in the War Room we have endless clichs as Muffley listens to his jingoistic USAF Chief of Staff General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) and deals with the Russians, the ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) and, on the hotline, Premier Kissoff. Things get even more mechanized when the Russians reveal they have a doomsday machine which will trigger several nuclear bombs which will shroud the world in Cobalt-Thorium G making the planet uninhabitable for 93 years. The device is a deterrent which will be triggered automatically in the event of nuclear attack. Muffley seeks the advice of his director of weapons research Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers in a third performance), an ex-Nazi scientist based loosely on Werner von Braun, representing the fascism in the machine still present almost 20 years after the war who is excited at the prospect of nuclear annihilation and the human race surviving down the bottom of mine shafts. If every character is a cog in the human machine, he is already very visibly half-machine, confined to a wheelchair and struggling with a gloved robot-like hand which has a life of its own.

The film is told in linear almost real time and continues unrelentingly to its despicable conclusion, but stressing repeatedly Mans fault for what happens. Ripper starts the problem, and when Mandrake tries to call the President having intuited the recall code for the planes he is delayed by an army officer with the ridiculous name of Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) who hesitates to shoot the lock off a Coke machine to get change for the public phone. When Mandrake does get through and the planes are recalled, all planes acknowledge except Kongs B-52 which due to human initiative has managed to dodge a missile aimed at it. Muffley assures Kissoff that if he puts everything into the sector of the planes primary and secondary targets then the plane will be shot down, but the B-52 has been hit, is losing fuel and so is going to a new target unknown to anyone outside the plane. Finally, the Russian doomsday machine is a nuclear deterrent that would only work if the whole world knows about it, but Kissoff loves surprises and fails to tell everyone in time. In this way, at every stage mechanical man combined with human error (in Kongs case this codes as initiative) ensures nuclear annihilation is inevitable.

Kubricks stunning treatment of Swiftian satire ensures that throughout the film the wicked humor is delivered in dead-pan fashion with none of the actors laughing. In this way the serious is made to look ridiculous and the ridiculous is made to look serious. The spectator is caught between laughing at the outrageous situations and gasping at the scary implications of events as they pan out. Kubrick proceeds by introducing things seriously only to undercut them comically. The off-screen narrator announces with grave seriousness the SAC defense system with its B-52s permanently air-born in case of an emergency only to follow it up by showing the pilot of one of the planes (Kong) reading Playboy magazine and another crew member playing cards. We expect the pilot to be a serious type, but as soon as he opens his mouth his Texan drawl announces a cowboy. Whats a cowboy doing piloting a B-52? As he prepares himself to respond to the go-code he dons his magnificent cowboy hat and drawls laconically, This is it boys. Nuclurur combat toe to toe with the Rooskies! John Wayne was mooted for the part after Peter Sellars said no to a 4th role, but Slim Pickens is perfectly cast here to the extent that once seen we can imagine nobody else in the role. Then, when we are first introduced to Turgidson it is through his private secretary Ms. Scott (Tracy Reed) lying on a hotel sunbed in the same pose that we have just seen her as Kongs Playboy centerfold. The big news that Ripper has flipped is relayed by her to Turgidson who is in the bathroom. A playmate should not be the secretary of the Chief of Staff just as the Chief of Staff should not be giving important directions while voiding his bowels or even giving them through his bowels. And so it goes throughout the film, Kubrick continually pulling the rug from underneath serious situations with subversive humor which all the characters fail to see, but we surely do!

The comedy is rich and arises mainly from 3 themes that snake through the film seeming to connect the 3 locations as much as they are actually sealed off from each other  food, sex and infantile regression. The opening credit sequence captures all three at once as the child-like graffiti credits appear over two B-52s, one re-fueling the other to the song Try a Little Tenderness. The images connote sex as well as a mother giving suck to her baby. Kubricks cutting of the concluding custard pie fight in the War Room weakens the food connection, but we still notice food omnipresent throughout. Following the B-52 feeding her baby we notice the seriousness of the radio operators relay of the attack order to Kong undercut by speaking through a sandwich he is stuffing into his mouth. When Mandrake collects a radio from inside a machine we notice an apple and a banana left there. When Ms. Scott relays the telephone conversation to Turgidson we notice reflected in the mirror behind her the remains of a meal, and in the War Room one side of the triangular construction is lined with a long buffet where we can see amongst other food those custard pies that were eventually cut. When Sadesky arrives he asks if theres fresh fish and settles for poached eggs. When Kong dishes out the emergency pack supplies prominent among them are rations for 4 days. Ripper never eats but he talks endlessly about bodily fluids and his idea of the Commie conspiracy contaminating ice cream with fluoride. Turgidson spends the entire film chewing down on gum as if it were cud providing for an endless series of hilarious facial expressions, and the concluding scene has him and Muffley sitting in front of the buffet drinking away as Dr. Strangelove gets excited talking about slaughtering cows for the mines.

Anthony Macklin has noted the films progression from foreplay to explosion, the continuing sex metaphor dominating the way these characters think and act throughout. If the foreplay is the credits sequence, the explosion is the final orgasmic doomsday ride as Kong straddles the nuclear bomb like a giant phallus as he waves his hat and plays the rodeo rider plunging to oblivion. We eventually learn that Jack D. Ripper (the name of the most notorious sex-murderer in history) is sexually somewhat unbalanced, confusing post-coital depression with impotence. This caused him to blame the Commies for sapping his bodily fluids and so he retaliates sexually  by sending bombers out to kill the sappers, by smoking a huge phallic cigar which shrinks as the film goes on, by replacing it with a machine gun and then a pistol with which he blows his own brains out. The films most priceless moment comes when Ripper makes his big speech, Kubricks camera low looking up stressing the mans huge cigar suggestive of huge potency as he asks Mandrake, Do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war? He said war was too important to be left to the generalsBut today war is too important to be left to the politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought. I can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration, communist indoctrination, communist subversion and the International Communist Conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. The words are completely logical and suggestive of a strong, responsible mindset belonging to those die-hard grass-roots anti-Communists of the day until that is those last 3 words where he is revealed as a crackpot. As said Kubrick gives us plausible seriousness delivered seriously, but then pulls the rug from under our feet which causes us to belly-laugh at something that oughtnt be funny at all. Sterling Hayden gives an inspired performance throughout  how he could keep a straight face during this speech simply amazes me!

Prior to his phallic ride to the ultimate orgasm Kong has been reading Playboy. When the safe is opened to get the Plan R attack profile we see porno pictures on the door. When he dishes out the survival kit in addition to food there are lipsticks, nylons and prophylactics and Kongs famous line, Shoot, a fella could have a good time in Vegas with all this stuff. (Vegas was changed from Dallas because of the JFK assassination). Their primary objective is given as Laputa which is not only a flying island visited by Gulliver (thus making the Swift connection explicit) but the Spanish word for whore. Sex is also uppermost in Turgidsons mind as he leaves a sore Ms. Scott telling her to start her sexual countdown and be ready to blast off on his return. Scott also calls him at the War Room, her sex drive as difficult to satisfy as Turgidsons. Then right at the end his face lights up at the prospect of living at the bottom of a mine shaft with a ratio of 10 women to 1 man. In the War Room there also sits a President with a rude name  both merkin and muffley are names for the female pudenda  but his head is ironically bald and phallic-like. His opposite number in Russia is named Kissoff and then most sinister of all there is Dr. Strangeloves darkly erotic sexual nature. As the President sits on a chair rendered impotent by the machine he has lost control of, Strangelove gets excited at the prospect of mineshafts to the point where he stands up from his wheelchair, a throbbing human erection signifying a sinister future for the human race.

Even more than food and sex we notice infantile regression increasingly dominates proceedings, especially in the War Room in the three way relationship between Turgidson, Muffley and the Russians. Turgidson starts off carefully, but his over-enthusiasm for a pre-emptory nuclear strike is pure child with childish language and body gestures to match. On the Russian reaction to the American attack he says, they are going to go absolutely ape, and with face twitching and eye-brows executing gymnastics he outlines Rippers hope for an all-out American attack which will catch em with their pants down! He accepts the Russians may still retaliate, but he minimizes the damages with Im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed. Tops. Depending on the breaks. George C. Scotts performance here has to be seen to be believed, cutting to the essence of the jingoistic military man in a brilliant way which is both realistic and completely off the wall. The childishness continues with his objections to Sadesky entering the room (Hell see the big board!) followed by schoolyard name-calling (Kissoff is an atheist Commie rat) and then the slapstick highlight of the film where he wrestles with Sadesky over a spy camera which causes President Muffley to reprimand them with the classic line, Gentlemen, you cant fight here, this is the War Room! We notice Turgidson doesnt just regress to acting the infant (he was that already in the hotel room with Ms. Scott), he regresses back to being an ape. The Russians are not the only ones to go ape in the film as he assumes increasingly simian postures, huddled over clutching his book World Targets in Megadeaths, standing on a chair for a prayer which gets rudely interrupted and then losing control of himself completely as he imitates (arms spread out) a B-52 landing perfectly when asked by Muffley if Kongs plane can still get through before he remembers where he is and his apologetic hand comes up to cover his mouth. Scott was reportedly angry with Kubrick for printing the takes where he was only practicing with what he thought was over-acting. Kubrick even retained one take where he accidentally falls over and continues to talk completely in character. He may have complained, but his performance is absolutely brilliant as he was later forced to admit. Peter Sellers is also brilliant, all 3 of him. As Mandrake he is in his element doing a British upper class twit accent. At Burpelson he is the voice of reason as Ripper rambles on madly and Bat Guano equally madly defends the sanctity of private property. As Muffley he excels playing him as a mild-mannered liberal in the image of Adlai Stevenson, the UN ambassador during the Cuban missile crisis. His great infantile regressive moments come in two beautifully judged telephone conversations with Kissoff, the first a series of hilarious childish exchanges (.its good to be fine) in which he speaks to a drunk Russian premier in the manner of an adult addressing a 4-year old infant: Now Dmitri, you know weve always talked about the bomb Kissoff hilariously directs him to Omsk information because hes forgotten the phone number of the civil defense agency, and then they waste precious minutes competing to be sorrier than the other. We never hear Kissoff, Sellers getting the conversation across on his own with inspired lunacy. The way he hesitates slightly before announcing Russia is about to be annihilated is again priceless. The second phone call is more fraught as they worry over the loose B-52  Im not hysterical, says Muffley hysterically to an equally hysterical Kissoff. And of course his advice to put everything youve got in those 2 sectors and you cant miss, is completely wrong. Sellers third character Strangelove is also very effective for me though other people seem to disagree. He gets the mad German scientist down pat especially when we recognize the Fritz Lang connection. The glove and wild hair comes from Rotwang, the mad scientist in Metropolis (1927) while the wheelchair comes from Hagi, the master criminal in Spione (1928). And we mustnt forget that in 1964 it was a brave insight to make that fascism was still with us despite Hitler having died 20 years before. If people call Sellerss portrait infantile then that is precisely the point. This is a film where the masters of the world are unmasked as infantile herdmen blindly following mechanized procedures which doom them to ultimate destruction. Such is the nature of modern man says Kubrick (echoing Nietzsche), the rot having set in during the 18th century enlightenment to which Swiftian satire was the natural response.

With so much conceptual brilliance concentrated into the script and the acting the visual side of Dr. Strangelove may seem relatively low-key, but Gilbert Taylors cinematography and Ken Adams marvelous sets are extremely accomplished, suiting the text brilliantly. Kubrick asked Adam to design sets with ceilings, set-ups to be source-lit either from the side or from below. The three main arenas are therefore dark with characters tending to lean into the camera with ceilings bearing down oppressively. Extreme whites and blacks are accentuated making for a threatening series of images  Ripper rambling on nonsensically with Kubricks camera looking up capturing his profile with the huge phallic cigar, Turgidsons simian postures caught again from a low angle as his bulk seems to bully the whole War Room, and Dr. Strangelove caught in the shadows as Turgidson says his prayer about the valley of fear. The triangular set for the War Room is inspired with its darkness enveloping a huge round poker table and the computer maps which loom down pressurizing everyone. The visual presentation is in the usual Kubrickian diametrically opposite manner. In the War Room the talk is increasingly animated and out of control so Kubrick captures everything with static cameras, use of wide angle lenses, sensing the drama coming from the actors. In the B-52 the actions of the crew couldn't be cooler and more mechanized and so Kubrick adds the drama with a handheld camera which he operates himself. Similarly, the outside fighting sequences at Burpelson are handheld while the office with protracted scenes between Ripper and Mandrake are as static as the scenes in the War Room, the drama again allowed to come from the performances. A lot of people might at first object to the artificial use of model planes shot in front of projected images (actually shot over Norway) for the B-52s protracted run into Russia, but everything falls into place when Kong rides his phallic bomb at the end, a sequence that could only be artificial. With all the artificiality that precedes it, the sequence doesnt jar at all, the natural culmination of everything that has happened.

Finally, perhaps the thing that raises Dr. Strangelove to the level of genius is the films passionate anger, an anger which is so essential for Swiftian satire to work. Kubrick is clearly not happy with a power structure which allows for nuclear warfare and in this film he voices his exasperation at the state of modern man that things should have come to such a sorry state. His perception has always been essentially misanthropic and later this view leads to an icy-coldness which remains brilliant, but becomes somehow passion-less. Here, he seems to be amplifying out of the humanism shown so skillfully in Paths of Glory. That was a film set in two spaces which define one another  the French chateau where the generals play with each other, and the trenches where men pay the price for their games. The films humanism is present in the voice of Colonel Dax who gives us a clear moral viewpoint condemning the generals and forcing us to sympathize with his men. The angry protest is carefully articulated and was so successful that the film was banned in France for many years. Dr. Strangelove adds a third space to the equation. The French chateau becomes the War Room, the trenches become both Burpelson and the B-52, but the figure of humanism is removed. Dax has no equivalent in the film as everyone becomes extensions of their machines with no humanity involved at all. Kubricks misanthropy lies right here, but because he uses satire (in which characters are stripped of personalities and made into comic cyphers) he is able to retain the passion and the anger is allowed to hit home with resounding success. Scary, hilarious, despicably brilliant, as a film Id say its nigh on faultless.",1519171200,,23923,4.939130434782609

166261,5,0800141709,"... perhaps its not much of a surprise that Ive kept coming back to Dr. Strangelove over the last few months.

But its not just the films newfound currency that makes me return. Its a welcome opportunity to rediscover Stanley Kubrick as he came into his own. While I took pleasure in Spartacus and Lolita, those were Hollywood productions that (very sensibly) employed the budding director. By contrast, Dr. Strangelove was distinctly a Kubrick film with his thought and vision wholly intact.

It is fascinating to watch him deal with humor. (This would be his only comedy.) Hes careful in parceling it out. I especially love the exquisite restraint in the scenes between Sterling Haydens soberly off-the-deep-end General Jack Ripper and Sellers oh-so-upright Lionel Mandrake. I don't know how the actors kept straight faces  would that there were outtakes here  but they did and their scenes are splendidly insane for the effort. Less is indeed more.

And thats the rule for most of the distance: fly just under our radar. There are outright laughs, to be sure. Keenan Wynn whips out one of the films few overt punchlines and its hard not to smile at the clearly comic antics of George C. Scotts riled-up, sputtering General Buck Turgidson.

But Sellers president, Slim Pickens bomber pilot and the ethos are conceived within this same essentially stoic spirit  effectively setting us up for Sellers (yes, again!) climactic appearance as Dr. Strangelove.

Arguably, the doctor is overdone. Arguably, hes not even that funny. But I suspect thats missing the point. Hes strategically overdone  a metaphorical bomb to roil the scripts placid surface at the critical moment. And at least at this level, its successful. The film detonates just ahead of the bomb and were on our way home.",1516665600,6,1783,5.016949152542373

166272,5,0800141709,"DR. STRANGELOVE is a black and white movie about ""The Bomb.""  The movie stars George C. Scott, Peter Sellers, and Slim Pickens.  For those not familiar with Slim Pickens, countless Americans have been thrilled by his comedic charm in Spielberg's epic movie, 1941. George C. Scott plays General Turgidson, who is played in an exaggerated cartoonish manner.  Sterling Hayden plays General Jack Ripper, who plays an unpleasant paranoid character, who likes to talk about ""precious bodily fluids.""  General Jack Ripper eventually shoots himself in his quarters.  Keenan Wynn plays Colonel Bat Guano, and in this movie, he resembles the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  His ""big scene"" in this movie is to shoot a hole in a Coca Cola machine in order to get change for a pay telephone, and out of the hole comes a gush of soda that douses Colonel Bat Guano (in the same humiliating manner as the humiliation showered upon the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off).  The Coca Cola scene occurs at 73 minutes.

Dr. Strangelove begins with an image of a remote island poking above the clouds, with the narration, ""For more than a year, ominous rumors had been privately circulating among high level western leaders, that the Soviet Union had been at work on what was the ultimage weapon, a doomsday device.  Intelligence sources traced the site of the top-secret Russian project . . . to the perpetually fog-shrouded wasteland below the Arctic peaks of the Zerkoff Islands . . . ""

SEXY FUELING SCENE.  Then, at the 75-second time point, begins footage showing the fueling by a tanker jet to a bomber.  Some of the footage shows a side view of the two jets, which are connected to each other by the fueling tube.  Some of the footage was shot where the camera was pointing out the rear fueling door of the tanker jet, and in this shot, the viewer is shown how the fueling pipe thrusts in and out and in and out of the receiving device of the bomber.  The music is romantic Montovani music.  After a couple of minutes of this amusing sexual innuendo, the plot starts.

We see an airforce base with radar antenna rotating, and a bomber taking off.  Then we see a general conversing with Peter Sellars. ""The base is being put on condition red . . . I'm afraid this is not an exercise . . . I'm afraid this is a shooting war,"" says the general.  The general is General Jack Ripper.

At the 6-minute time point comes visually appealing footage of bombers flying over snowy mountain peaks.  At 6 min, 30 sec, we see Slim Pickens in the pilot's seat in the cockpit of a bomber reading Playboy Magazine.  At 8 min, his crew consults a codebook, and Slim Pickens and his crew discuss ""Plan R.""  Slim Pickens converses with another crewman, saying: ""Did you say using Attack Plan R? . . . how many times have I told you that I don't want no horsing around on the airplane . . . well I've been to one world's fair, one picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard coming over a set of earphones . . . you sure you got today's code? . . . there's just gotta be something wrong.""  Slim Pickens looks at the control panel which reads: FGD135.  Then, he looks in the codebook, and notices that FGD135 matches up with Attack Plan R.  At 9 min, 45 sec, we see fellow crewman James Earl Jones (as we know, he later played the voice of Darth Vader).  At 10 min begins a steady drumbeat and trumpet playing, ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home.""  (This is on the soundtrack whenever we are shown the inside of Slim Pickens' jet bomber.)  Slim Pickens says, ""Well boys, I guess this is it.  Nuclear combat, toe-to-toe with the Ruskies . . . look boys, I ain't much a hand at giving speeches . . . I have a fair idea of the personal emotions you might be thinking.""  (At this point, Slim Pickens has put on his cowboy hat, and he speaks into a microphone.)

BIKINI SCENE.  Then, at 12 min, we are in General Turgeson's suite (played by George C. Scott) and the viewer is treated to many views of his secretary in a bikini.  The two of them talk about Plan R.  For three entire minutes, the viewer is treated to images of the slender secretary in a bikini.  At 16 min, the scene returns to Peter Sellars in the computer room at an air force base, that is, at the same air force base where General Jack Ripper works.

BODILY FLUIDS.  This movie has a few references to ""precious bodily fluids.""  The first of these references occurs at 24 minutes in a talk in General Ripper's office by the general to Peter Sellars. At 46 min, General Ripper says this to Peter Sellars, ""fresh pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.""  This takes place in a discussion about fluoridation being a Communist plot.  At 56 minutes, the dialogue goes, ""foreign substances introduced into our precious bodily fluids . . . that's the way a Commie works.""  At 60 min, Peter Sellars remarks that there was never anything wrong with his ""bodily fluids.""

SURVIVAL KIT.  At 35 min, the scene changes from the tense situation in the war room, to the comedic situation in the bomber piloted by Slim Pickens.  Comedy comes from the perusual of the items in the survival kit.  The items include, vitamin pills, morphine pills, sleeping pills, Russian phrase book, Russian rubles, prophylactics, nylon stockings, etc.  The sound track features a harmonica and snare drum.  Slim Pickens remarks, ""Shoot!  A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with that stuff!!!""

At 51 minutes, the character of Dr. Strangelove make his entrance, and the discussion is about the Doomesday Machine.  Here, Dr. Strangelove (played by Sellers) speaks to the President of the United States (played by Sellers).  At 61 minutes, General Ripper kills himself in the bathroom, thus bringing to a halt his chit-chat session with Peter Sellers.  The scene then changes, and we are with Slim Pickens in his bomber.  The problem is that a Russian missile approaches, and it damages the bomber.  At this point, Peter Sellers needs to call the President of the United States, but he does not have change for the pay telephone, and the viewer is treated to the Coca Cola scene (described above).  At 68 minutes, Slim Pickens continues to fly his damaged bomber and he says: ""If we was flying any lower we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.""

At 82 minutes, James Earl Jones notices a problem with the bomb bay doors.  They won't open.  So Slim Pickens decides to go down to the bomb bay to open them manually.  Slim Pickens orders James Earl Jones to ""fire the explosive bolts"" but this does not work.  And so, as the snare drums continue, and as the horns play ""Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" Slim Pickens plays his very, very, famous ""Yee-hawwww"" scene by riding one of the nuclear bombs out of the bomb bay door, where it eventually explodes. Then, we hear the sone, ""We'll Meet Again.""  The real reason I bought this movie was to see if it was the recording by The Byrds or the recording by Vera Lynn.  I was disappointed to learn that it was Vera Lynn's recording, not the recording by The Byrds.  Oh well.",1512086400,3,7065,4.5667726550079495

166279,5,0800141709,"Great movie. Only thing that wasn't realistic is you don't grab the barrel of a 50-cal (assuming that's what that was in the office) and shoot, drag or hold it for any amount of time during or after fire. Saw a soldier's hand nearly melt off when he went to change barrels without proper gloves. Those barrels get white hot from use very quickly. That would be the only thing offhand that is obvious error. Yeah it looks cool to shoot like that but in reality you would never want to have a hand anywhere near that barrel. Over all, very great movie. Good satire of the cold war and yet stays serious at the same time. Kind of creepy that way in that it's poking fun but staying serious all the while.

166290,5,0800141709,"Peter Sellers is one of the greatest comedians of all time, and it shows here where he plays three hilarious characters. His attempt as president to stop an atomic bomb from dropping is beyond brilliant and drop-dead funny, his attempt as Captain Mandrake to stop the obviously insane General Ripper from DROPPING the bomb splits your sides, and his playing of the wheelchair-bound, former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove is absolute genius. George C. Scott's gruff General ""Buck"" Turgidson is amazing too. (Especially his dramatic, in-character trip that he mastered his way through!!!)

Just a year or two ago, there was the Cuban Missile Crisis and a year later the Gulf of Tonkin incident that started the draft. It is one of those low budget films from Britain that had a lot of political influence. Dr. Strangelove is used as a pun in literature and political satire.",1485820800,,533,4.134615384615385

166386,5,0800141709,"November 22nd,1963, John. F.Kennedy is shot in a car in Dallas. The same day, Kubrick's latest film, Dr. Strangelove, is set to premiere the same day. In the end of the film, there is a sequence that the family of Kennedy will find offensive. Here is a quote from Wikipedia regarding the final scene,
""The assassination also serves as another possible reason that the pie-fight scene was cut. In the scene, after Muffley takes a pie in the face, General Turgidson exclaims: ""Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!"" Editor Anthony Harvey stated that the scene ""would have stayed, except that Columbia Pictures were horrified, and thought it would offend the president's family. Kubrick and others have said that the scene had been cut before preview night because it was inconsistent with the rest of the film.""  That scene was farce the rest of the film was satire. The movie was originally intended to be a cold-war thriller, but there were so many satirical elements that they decided to turn it into one of the funniest films ever made. You have Peter Sellers in his best role and film as Captain Mandrake, President Muffley, and the mad scientist, Dr. Strangelove. This is probably one of Kubrick's finest films, if not the finest Kubrick film, the greatest Peter Sellers performance and film and one of the greatest movies ever made.",1482796800,,1373,4.867521367521367

The interior of a B-52 bomber was at the time classified, but the set they made up was apparently so accurate that Stanley Kubrick and the set designer nearly got in actual legal trouble with the US government. Also the plane that flew around north to get the background footage for the flying scenes passed over a real US military base which assumed it to be a Russian spy plane and it sent jets to force the plane to land.

166496,5,0800141709,"The Cold War may be over, but this is still the funniest film I've ever seen (despite the fact it's about nuclear war). Peter Sellers deserved two, best actor Oscars for his role both as the titular character and as a British, army official, while Kubrick was robbed for the first (but not last) time in his brilliant career of a Best Director Oscar. Worst of all, this film -- now considered by many critics to perhaps be the best film ever made -- actually lost the Best Picture Oscar back in '65 to ""The Sound of Mucus, uh, Music,"" for goodness sake!

(Even in the opening credits it says the following incidents are not possible)  Not sure if the USAF made him put this in or what, but it's a little bizarre. The ending also has some historic photo's of nuclear testing by the US and USSR before they were banned.

Peter Sellers' multiple roles were performed flawlessly with the complex strangeness shown in the title role shooting the film's ending over the top. Please, do not let the 'technical' appearance of the Cold War detract from enjoying the very same absurdity of the Cold War.

Much more recently, in the last decade or so I've learned quite a bit, up close, about the military mindset and ways.  I am not bashing the military.  We still need them.  But their job, ultimately, is to kill.  I see things from a broader human perspective.  This film is perfectly relevant now, even with the threat of nuclear attack diminished BECAUSE the weak points of military way of thinking and doing have not changed in any significant way; after all the ultimate mission remains the same.",1450310400,10,852,4.48051948051948

166812,5,0800141709,"""Dr. Strangelove"" is a classic film, a comedy dealing with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation, directed by Stanley Kubric and starrring Peter Sellers who plays three roles.  Based on a serious anti-nuke novel of the period, it was transformed into a brilliant and biting satire by Terry Southern.  It is remarkable that half a century after the movie first appeared, the mentality of the military and the right-wing paranoia that underwrites it are as frightening and laughable as they were when the film first appeared.",1449014400,,537,5.022471910112359

This is a 'Must See' movie for movie buffs as there are so many memorable scenes and lines.  Even the song they play when the bomb goes off is priceless!  For history buffs...the movie shows that not too much has changed in terms of human behavior in the past 50 years.  This movie was filmed in black and white and could not have been filmed in color because we see that so much of life is NOT black and white...only a movie can be B&W.  Peter Sellers (who I am not a fan of) plays three different rolls: each one better than the other.  Sterling Hayden is sensational and one of the camera angles Kubrick uses while 'Jack D.

Among the films released that dealt with the threat of global nuclear annihilation (On the Beach and Fail Safe among them), this is the one remembered, possibly because parody and satire are the only real way to deal with the absurd idea of nuclear was and mutually assured destruction (MAD)!  It stars Peter Sellers.  Who remembers him anymore?  But at that time he was a sought-after star.  And it included a long list of stars.  A hidden gem is the combat footage seen when US Army forces attack and take over a US Air Force base to attempt to capture a military commander gone mad.

It definitely made me chuckle a few times but that's all it ever did and most of it was rather boring. The rest of the time I spent anticipating it getting better, which never really happens.

Peter Sellers plays the president, his German advisor, and a British officer assigned to an American Air Force base.  He was supposed to play the bomber pilot and navigator but it was too much.  James Earl Jones, a stage actor and movie unknown at the time was brought in to play the navigator and Slim Pickens, a friend of the director, was brought in to play the pilot.

It revolves around Jack D Ripper, a general whose conspiracy theories about the USSR lead him to activate an uncalled-for nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the chaos that results as the rest of the government attempts to undo his damage. This film is a dark comedy in the best way - serious enough for the subject matter (involving an impending nuclear apocalypse) but also satirical enough to point out the flaws of the Cold War era way of thinking.  It's on the same level as Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"", and the predecessor to those that have emulated (and many may argue less successfully) such as ""The Dictator"" and ""The Interview"".  The cinematography is brilliant - Kubrick in the best way - and the style of the film recalls that of the government news-film broadcasts of the time.  Peter Sellers in three roles is incredible, and I'll admit that I did not realize it was the same actor at first as he plays them all so differently and varies his appearance and mannerisms so much for each one.

Peter Sellers is brilliant in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" playing three roles (RAF Capt. Mandrake, US President Murky Mumbly and the German scientist Dr. Strangelove).  The whole satire of what would happen if a full scale nuclear war were to occur is fabulously presented.  We have characters with funny names denoting their status in the film and I especially love the dialogue involving Slim Pickens' character of the B-52 pilot and his crew (featuring a young James Earl Jones as the bombardier) preparing to follow their orders to attack the Russians (""Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Las Vegas with all that stuff"" as they review their survival kits.)  When the end does finally come, along with Slim Pickens riding the nuke like a bronco, we get a last chuckle as the President and his military advisors contemplate taking shelter from the fallout in deep mineshafts with nothing to do but enjoy the four-women-per-man ratio needed to repopulate the country after the fallout subsides.",1441411200,,1305,5.112676056338028

167267,5,0800141709,"Maybe the most perfect movie ever made. Is that an overstatement? Well, I guess it's somewhat subjective.

Kubrick read Peter Bryant's book ""Red Alert"" on a trans Atlantic flight. He started to make the movie as a straightforward account of the Cold War but, as he got into the meat, the dark comedic side of the thing emerged.

The monochrome seems to highlight the grey ""cloud"" that hung over the world of the 40's and 50's. USA and Russia constantly puffing out their chests after having detonated a bomb bigger than the last one. Such an insane time of life that culminated in the Bay of Pigs and the few days we stared down the barell of mutual annhialation. Humanity lost its mind yet, there's comedic irony in it all and that's what Kubrick tapped into with this movie.

The movie basically resets between the Pentagon ""War Room"", a B52, an Air Force base. Events in each space being dictated by events in the other two. In a nutshell events that are unfolding are leading America's military and Governmental ""higher ups"" down a path to a horrific decision, total nuclear commitment against Russia. The President (Peter Sellars) doesn't want to. Air Force Commander (George C. Scott) wants to go all in. (See if you can guess who George C. Scott's character ""Buck Turgedson"" is based on.) It's a race against time. One of the advisors is an ex Nazi in the form of Dr. Strangelove and his untameable right-hand. Brilliant

In summary, A CLASSIC from 1963 that's funny as all get-out but systemically frightening as all heck. If you lived through the Cold War you'll definitely see the irony. If you're new to the era you'll look back and wonder how we lost our minds.",1440720000,,1673,4.661016949152542

Give Peter Sellers multiple roles and permission to ad lib and the jokes and verbal contortions will fly. In this movie, just about everyone has a delightfully memorable line or two. Most of my favorite quotes come out of this movie. Listen close and try not to miss anything, or you will answer to the Coca-Cola company. (None of your preversions!)

General Jack D. Ripper explains to Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake about the Communist conspiracy to infiltrate the USA via our precious bodily fluids using fluoride.

Even if you've never seen this movie, you've probably seen scenes from it. Slim Pickens as Maj. King Kong riding the missile like a bucking bronc is used everywhere. Scenes with Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) in a wheelchair are also commonplace. You might also recognize the closing scenes of bombs exploding to the song ""We'll Meet Again.""

My favorite scene is between Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) and Col. Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) and the Coke machine. ""You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola company.""

The one-sided phone conversations between President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and Soviet Premier Kissoff reminds me of Bob Newhart's hilarious telephone bits.

What makes the movie so enjoyable is the colorful host of chracters that are not fictitious at all-- the hedging president,  war hawk military men and perverted eugenics crazed scientist! All these men have existed in history and still do today. It's a miracle that human civilization is still around at all.

But before you get too deep into the political statement of the film, in its purest form, this movie is all about sex. From the planes fueling during the credits to the falic shaped bombs creating massive ""explosions"" at the end, Dr. Strangelove... is all about men in power giving into their primal urges to kick off and release. What a genius connection by Stanley Kubrick and hats off to the cast for delivering, especially Sellers!",1438300800,,910,4.598765432098766
167417,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove is one of only sixteen films directed by Stanley Kubrick. Others include: A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Spartacus, 2001 - A Space Odyssey, and Lolita. Each one is different and stands out on its own.

This film is a dark reflection of the insane politics of the cold war. The strange and humorous antics portrayed in the film were not as bizarre as they seem now as seen in the light of the mid-twentieth century mind set. As a school student, I was made to practice hiding under my desk in the case of a nuclear attack. No kidding! There was a US Air Force general whose foreign policy suggestion was to bomb China back to the stone age. So sending US strategic bombers to destroy the USSR, and vice-versa, was the reality of daily life of the time that Dr. Strangelove was filmed.

Peter Sellers is at his best in this film as Dr. Strangelove. He also played two other roles. The best line ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room."" An interesting note is that one scene of a US bomber flying over the Arctic Ocean was reused by Kubrick as part of the star gate sequence in 2001 - A Space Odyssey,",1438300800,3,1135,4.374407582938389

Peter Sellers is the character actor of character actors, portraying multiple roles to such perfection you often forget that they are the same actor.  George C. Scott goes against his usual gruff and hardcore characters we usually see him act to play a general that is so inept that the fact that World War III is about to commence does not even register as a problem to him (""Well, I, uh, don't think it's fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up, sir."").

For those of us who lived through the constant ordeal with the USSR--it was hard for us, at first, to even believe our eyes and ears when this bombshell came out. We were used to hiding under chairs to protect ourselves from the impact and explosion of H-bombs. Talk about ridiculous. Put your hands behind your neck, and stand in a doorway if you don't have a basement. And that will stop the H-bomb from hurting you.

I was a kid in school who lived 50 or so miles from the biggest atomic weapons assembly plant on Earth, and when the school gave the three bell signal for an atomic weapons drill, me and my friends would just look at each other, and laugh out loud. We knew the ""commies"" would hit our nuclear facility as fast as possible, and if you thought the shades on the concrete in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bad, an H-bomb would make that look like a dance in the park.

Anyway, you don't have to be a geezer to love this movie. Every single part was played to perfection by every actor. It's weird when that happens at all, and especially weird with all the big name people in this film. If you haven't seen Dr. Strangelove, you'll want to watch it again pretty soon, since you'll lose a lot of watching time the first time from laughing.

Sellers is beyond talented as an actor, taking on multiple roles with different speaking accents. While Sellers carries this film, it's important to give credit to a great supporting cast, with George C. Scott, Keenan Wynn, James Earl Jones, Slim Pickens, Tracy Reed, and Sterling Hayden all delivering in their roles. This is a film about the Cold War actually materializing, courtesy of an insane general.

167501,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, commonly known as Dr. Strangelove, is a black comedy film which satirizes the nuclear scare. It was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, and featuring Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens. The film is loosely based on Peter George's Cold War thriller novel Red Alert, also known as Two Hours to Doom.

Dr. Strangelove's jet-black satire and a host of superb comic performances have kept the film fresh and entertaining, even as its issues have become less timely. This landmark movie's humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time. Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964 - its year of release.",1433548800,,810,5.090225563909774

167509,2,0800141709,"Let me introduce this with the fact that I read about the making of this movie in the ""Chicago Tribune"", and it mentioned that it was NOT originally intended to be a comedy. Fair warning?

Well, it may have intended to be a dark comedy, but it had few laughs and the storyline wasn't very convincing. Why wouldn't anybody at the base have long since determined that General Ripper was crazy? And the British officer with him, unless he were utterly blind, should have been easily able to see through and overpower him. And it was very hard to believe that a nuclear bomber plane could be located, shot at, and damaged, but still be able to fly all the way to its target without further interference. (When Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane was detected by the Soviet air defense force in May 1960, they threw everything they had available at it until it was brought down.)

Sterling performances by Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens (in the role of a lifetime) make it worth watching.  The phenomenal Peter Sellers essays three roles.  Sellers is brilliant as the ineffective American president (must be a Democrat) and a British officer, but like George C.

Dr. Strangelove was a Cold War parody, with ex-German(post-WW2) scientists assisting us, as they did with NASA.  Here, however, they are just consultants.
In the film, we(USA)send an attack formation of B52 nuclear-armed bombers into Soviet (Russia) air space.  The attack was not authorized by anyone but the 'disturbed' base commander(Sterling Hayden).  To recall the bombers, the president(Peter Sellers) orders the army to take that air force base, produce the commander who ordered the air strike, and get him to recall them.  The dialogue of the base commander and his adjutant(also Sellers) was brilliant and hilarious.  George C. Scott showed perfect comedic timing in his role as another USAF general.
The realism in the movie was such that the Defense Department scoured their ranks to see how such detail(in re the B52, etc.) got out.  Later it came out that the info was in Popular Science.  But as in 2001-A Space Odyssey, the technical details are so spot on that you are drawn into a reality created on-screen and won't let go until the end.  Though this was a comedy, Roger Ebert said he saw it at an air force base and the crowd was utterly ashen silent, treating it as an interesting, if over the top, actual scenario.
SO, for fun, or to see history with a twist of humor, this film is a must for baby-boomers or better.",1417478400,,1468,4.84

I can't help but to recognize the profound comment the poster above noted whereas the date of his post is the shift from the cold war into the war against terrorism. After 13 years, the information about what happened a couple of days before when ""Mr.trucido"" presented his comment shows that Dr. Stranglove and his group is timeless, just the ""enemy changes"".

Dr. Strangelove is only on screen for probably 10 minutes of the movie but I wanted more of him.

Dr. Strangelove is a beautiful comedy, filed with hilarious dialogue great characters and a plot that truly made a mockery out of a dark topic of the time. The acting work of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott definitely was the highlight of this film especially in the last few minutes that I had to pause the film so I could finish laughing before I could move on. Proceed with caution there is not much action or big special effects here. The special effects are definitely the words. You have to stay focused and follow along, if you miss one split second you will probably miss one or two incredible jokes.

All I wonder about after seeing this is why didn't Kubrick make more movies like this?!",1404345600,,788,4.542253521126761

Dr. Strangelove is 50 years old and the fun and message still holds up.  The Blu-Ray version is great, but if you are interested in it, buy it from Amazon. UK and not the U.S. Amazon.

The Blu-Ray was sold by Amazon in early 2013 for $9.99 and shortly went out of print and unavailable.  Private companies soon listed the Blu-Ray for $75 to $100.  I just bought it through Amazon. UK for $10.92 plus $3.99 in shipping (from The Netherlands) and watched it last night; it was a beautiful print.  The UK version is the same June 16, 2009 Release Date as the U.S. version and it is Region Free, so it will play on any Blu-Ray player.  Between the UK and the US versions, the cover is the only thing that is different; both versions are the full 95 minutes in the 1964 theatrical release.

Not winning the Academy Award for best actor after playing 3 parts in this cold war classic was a bad joke. He was nominated for Best Actor in this 1964 classic,Stanley Kubrick nominated for best director & Screenplay. And lost the best picture nomination. This translates into a movie  too controversial to win. Too real. Also in the cast George C. Scott (Patton), Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and character actor Slim Pickens as a B52 Pilot in a scene that defined his entire career. This is a black comedy about an ""accidental"" nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.

167654,3,0800141709,"There is a consistently flip quality to Kubrick's films. ""Strangelove"" supertypically exhibits this. That Kubrick is a snide clown is evident in all his films. It's a special element here.

It's difficult for younger people, I think, to imagine the nearly universal horror people in the US and elsewhere in the world had of nuclear warfare. This was true even if they hid this fear, and hid it from themselves.

This black comedy plays out against this fear in a different way than comedy/camp horror films play out before the audience those films draw. Not everyone lives in fear of serial killers or alien invaders. Everyone was afraid of nuclear warfare.

An additional element here is the implication that the USA was the main problem. This was not entirely fair, but the behavior of the Kennedy Regime seemed to give Kubrick something to stand on here. Kennedy installed atomic missiles in Turkey, pointed at Odessa and Kiev, attempted to invade Cuba through a proxy band of hobos and perverts, then screamed bloody murder when the Soviets responded in kind. Most Americans were vaguely aware, as they cheered their royal President, that his heroics were false. This was in our minds, many of us, at the time.

So there was really nothing funny In all of this. In fact, I don't remember anybody laughing. I suppose they do now. If they don't remember what it was like. Keep in mind that the only American President between Truman and Bush Senior who never sent signals that he would consider the use of nuclear weapons against an adversary, even one who was not a mortal threat to the people of the United States or its allies, was Dwight David Eisenhower.

It has not aged well and if anything despite it being a poor satire Only reinforces what every Cold Warrior then and now believed we were and Are Right. Making Fun of Curtis LeMay and others but disguising it as ""Satire"" is not only a insult to the memory of many lost in the Cold War Behind Enemy Lines and not that we don't know about but also dishonest and Historical Revisionism. And Have a Former Communist Sympathizer(Dictator Tito Admirer) such as Sterling Hayden(I did like that he did Name Names to Huac,so Maybe he can be redeemed) as the Crazy General who is hinted at being a closeted homosexual in the movie as a slap to All Conservatives as being such ""Crazy Red-baiters"".It can only come from someone who later made another antiWar Garbage Film such as FullMetalJacket from the Twisted Mind of Kubrick who is over-rated.

It speaks to the genius of Stanley Kubrick that this film started out as a deadly serious tale of potential nuclear holocaust. The process through which it became the satirical gem that it is, is fascinating. Peter Sellers (LOLITA, THE LADY KILLERS, BEING THERE) is his inimitable best in the roles of an RAF Colonel, the President of the U.S., and the hilarious title character. George C. Scott's General Turgidson is maniacally funny. Sterling Hayden is perfectly unhinged as General Jack Ripper, the man responsible for taking the world into probable nuclear annihilation! His theory about communist vital fluid contamination is as brilliant as it is ridiculous! Slim Pickens (BLAZING SADDLES) will forever be remembered for his glorious ride down on ""the bomb"". He, along w/ the entire crew of the fateful B-52 are wonderful, including the one-and-only James Earl Jones! STRANGELOVE takes atomic terror, the cold war, and paranoiac insanity, mixes them thoroughly, and pulls off the incredibly difficult task of making it humorous. Extremely humorous!

It showed crazy paranoid people in charge (LeMay, Nixon), ex-Nazis giving advice (Los Alamos), and ineffectual presidents worrying about their legacy (Bush... pick two) and not so much about people.

167694,5,0800141709,"Is war fate? Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb was was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. This famous directors philosophical nuance shines bright and this one is most certainly a classic. This film is pretty simple really. It's also awesome, thought provoking, and one of a kind. It's a black comedy about the horrors of nuclear combat. If I had to call it something, it would be Vonnegutesque. The film opens with a questionable red alert. It appears as if the U.S. is under some sort of attack. But is it true? What kind of attack is going on? Next you see a U.S. war plane receive a nuclear attack code.
It appears as if its go time for the American war planes to drop nuclear bombs on Russia. The unfortunate truth is that the attack was actually ordered by a delusional United States Air Force general.  The general comically (depending on how you see things) believes the communists are secretly polluting American bodily fluids. The reasoning behind this accusation is surprisingly never clearly explained. This key storyline angle makes the film highly relevant today considering the wide range of abstract conspiracy theories embedded in the American culture.  The United States President is faced with the serious challenge of halting the nuclear air strike while the doomsday clock winds down. It turns out that the bureaucratic nature of the military is the Presidents greatest hurdle to solving the problem.
The complexity of the situation drives the President to seek consul from a questionable individual named Dr. Strangelove.  Dr. Strangelove is very strange indeed. He doesn't come up with an answer to the immediate problem but he does come up with a plan for the future. For some, this film is hilarious. For others, it's probably terrifying.  The humor is drenched in paranoia and it stands up very well today. The lead (playing three different roles) is the late great Peter Sellers. Dr. Strangelove is certainly a tour de force on a number of different levels.

Doctor Strangelove, an ex-Hitler associate, has defected. However, half of his body (subconsciously controlled) is still loyal to Hiter and keeps trying to murder his other half.  That's just the tip of the iceberg of this ultra-quirky film where Peter Sellers plays multiple parts.

As good as he was, one has to wonder though whether it was Sellers, George C. Scott or Slim Pickins that pulled off the film.  These three were an excellent choice to play off one another's characters and were each responsible for helping to make this one of the most memorable satire films of all time.",1382918400,,772,4.825757575757576

The movie uses some incredibly dark humor to show that our ""civilization"" is a madhouse.  The performances are stellar (Peter Sellers plays three key roles in this one) and it is laugh out loud funny in many places and it is also cry out loud funny in others.

The use of black and white instead of color in some ways makes it more real.  Excellent choice.

Is is a dark comedy reacting to the cold war of the 1960's. Given our current world it is still relevant.

The overall story revolves around a doomsday nuclear scenario between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union.

In any case Petere Sellers perfomance as multiple characters in the film was masterful. The other actors were also terrific including Sterling Hayden as the crazed Colonel Jack D.

I've MET people with that ""war at any cost"" mentality; they scared the britches off of me.  I used to live not far from the former Carswell AFB and used to watch the '52s take off and land. I tried to block out the fact that they were carrying nuclear bombs to no avail.

Being an Air Force vet and having had to visit SAC bases as part of my duties was just a tad frightening because I had the appropriate clearance to BE on the bases, but my Air Force issued cameras did not.  I never felt comfortable leaving my gear aboard the craft on which I flew into the bases, but didn't want to lug it around either. Classic SNAFU all the time.

It is filled with great actors who are masterfully directed by Stanly Kubrick.

For modern audiences the special effects are cheesy.  Sometimes the acting is too, but that is done with a purpose.

It won't have the relevancy for those who didn't live in those days just after the Cuban missile crisis or the days of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD, never has something been so appropriately named by its initials).  Still all the other aspects of modern strife will ring true for modern audiences.  So this movie from a half century ago ages very well indeed.

If you haven't seen it, watch it. You won't regret it.

But for several decades, the sturm und drang of atomic war with the USSR seemed very real... except for a few who saw it as a persistent form of mass hysteria.

The situation is frighteningly plausible yet the characters that carry the film are bold tropes, caricatures of high comedy yet real and believable, When President Muffly admonishes General Buck Turgedson who is attempting to strangle the Russian ambassador exclaiming ""This is the War Room. There's no fighting in the War Room."" the irony is hilarious. And every scene has its LOL ironic moment right up until the B-52 pilot rides the bomb down over Russian soil.

There are very few comedic moments to it, and for those that are there, the humor is weak and accompanied with many minutes of dragging scenes.

When you are faced with the reality of ""it's the end of the world as we know it"", then all you can fight back with is humor. And this movie fights back. It makes fun, sarcastically, sardonically, deeply and darkly at the institutions that brought us (bring us?) to the brink. That these institutions are political, military, governmental, and nationalism versus nationalism, is not a random choice, what other institutions are capable of catastrophe at this level. Three actors raise the bar to heights that have not since been exceeded, Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden. This movie also sealed  Stanley Kubrick's reputation as an all time great director with a unique world view and the ability to deliver iot to the screen.",1376784000,,894,4.805194805194805

Fortunately, the movie turned out to be HILARIOUS! The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and it's all hilarious. Furthermore 1 guy plays 3 VASTLY different characters, I dare you to figure out which 3 were played by the same person! This is one of those old movies that are timeless, that time has not made less awesome. You will find this in another Black & White classic like Addams Family!

Some consider the Pink Panther movies to be Peter Sellers' greatest showcase, but I like his three characters in Dr. Strangelove better.

The politicians and military brass are posturing, petty, buffoons, who though not necessarily evil, are unable to prevent great evil.  The special effects are deliberately low budget but like a good book are triggers for the imagination and not attempts to substitute for it.  The whole is seamlessly cut and with its hyper intelligent yet corny script never fails to amuse and amaze.  The possibility of all out, total nuclear war that hung over our heads during the cold war has receded but that has been replaced by the appalling and equally irrational prospect of atomic terrorism.  Doomsday has not been abolished nor has Murphy's law been repealed.  The harder we squeeze to try and keep things under control the more the unintended consequences tend to dominate.  There's a reason why this film tops almost every list of best films.  It resonates with our psyches and experiences on so many levels yet we know deep down that we will never really learn from our mistakes while still clinging to absurd, whimsical hope when, as King Herod complains in W. H Auden's 'For the Time Being', ""the general, the statesman, and the philosopher have become the butt of every farce and satire.""",1373414400,,1468,4.979508196721311

The U.S. maintains a fleet of bombers carrying nuclear warheads within hours of targets inside the Soviet Union. And then something goes wrong. What could be viewed as serious scenario was instead created as a satirical black comedy by Stanley Kubrick.

In this film, a paranoid U.S. Air Force general orders a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. With the Soviets poised to retaliate at any moment, the U.S. President and his advisers scramble to convince the Soviet Premier that it was all a silly mistake and also try to recall the bombers.

The film is a good satire of Cold War policies such as mutual assured destruction and the possibility of a ""doomsday device."" All the actors in the film give great and memorable performances.

168111,4,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb was an enjoyable movie, one that was funny but also had a lot depth and meaning to all of it. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this movie was satirical and played the ridiculousness of the whole Cold War. Since the movie was centered around the President trying to correct and undo the general's actions, who gave wrong orders for airplane bomb carriers to bomb Russia, the mood was always very light. It was shot in black and white and it was uniquely designed to alert us of the evil inside the Cold War but also to make us laugh in absurdity.

Although fictional, many of the underlying themes that Kubrick depicted rings true to the Cold War and the society at that time. I thought Kubrick cleverly used themes such as fear of nuclear weapons, the self-destructive nature, paranoia to communism, gender imbalance, and fragmented governments to all point to the Cold War and its flaws.

Fractured governments and the self-destructive nature of them are clearly shown in Dr. Strangelove. Throughout this movie, the President had no power over the situation and was not in control like he should've been. The general didn't even consult him when falsely ordering the planes to bomb Russia. Instead, he had an ambassador from Russia who later is revealed was really a spy and was taking secret pictures of the U.S. Pentagon. In addition to the powerless U.S. president, the drunken Soviet Premier had no idea what was going on and did not respond the way he was to respond. The fractured government has given rise to self-destructive nature that Kubrick illustrates. There was fighting in the Pentagon, suicide on General Ripper's part and even U.S. soldiers killing and shooting at other U.S. soldiers. This can be related to the Cold War because during the Vietnamese War, when Lyndon Johnson was still in presidency, Nixon secretly delayed the peace accord, causing more people to die and settled for worse terms for the U.S. compared to Vietnam. The factions in the government created more problems which was played out in both the movie and in the Cold War.

Another theme that was in the movie, which accurately portrays the situation during the Cold War, was the fear of nuclear weapons. In the Cold War, this was the arms race, where Soviet Russia and the United States would increase their technology in weaponry and nuclear bombs. This advancement was purely for security, to know that you have the better bomb than the other country so they won't attack. This went up to the extent of having no way in advancing their technology further. This situation was coined ""MAD"" or Mutually Assured Destruction. In Dr. Strangelove, Soviet's had a better bomb, called the ""doomsday bomb"". The Soviet's had it because they thought the Americans had one. General Turgidson comments: ""Gee, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines"", representing their paranoia of not having the best technology. Also, paranoia of communism is characterized as the paranoia of having a bomb drop in Russia, which would lead to a doomsday bomb detonation. The paranoia of communism can be seen in McCarthyism, the HUAC pursuit of spies and ""duck and cover"" while the paranoia in this movie can be seen in the posture of General Turgidson and the music and mood of the film, which was always on edge.

 Gender imbalance was also a prominent theme in Dr. Strangelove. Throughout the entire movie, the only woman who appeared was the secretary of one of the generals. She was depicted as a sex object, with an outfit of a bikini and heels while tanning. Women were allowed voting rights only after 1920, when the Congress pass the bill. So it wasn't long ago that they were treated as real human beings and clearly some still had not made the transition. When the general spoke to the woman, he talked to her as if she were a child. They never respected them and only used them for pleasure. Even the number of women that appeared during this movie and the way men treated them should clearly reveal that Kubrick might have wanted to show the great gender imbalance during the Cold War.

The only thing that I find flawed in this movie were the random scenes. After some research, I found out that he was supposed to add something at the end but was cut because Kubrick did not like it. The scenes that were supposed to lead to the end scene were not cut so don't be surprised if you didn't understand some scenes throughout the movie.

 Despite this minor flow, all in all, I thought this movie was made really well and was quite hilarious with surprisingly a lot of hidden themes relating to the Cold War. There were some parts which were intriguing to see happen so subtly but I'm glad I caught them. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I won't mind watching it again!",1364256000,,4808,4.71547619047619
168131,5,0800141709,"This is probably one of the most important movies of the 20th century.

Those expecting gags, slapstick, and obvious jokes served to the audience on a silver platter should look elsewhere (not that silly humor is bad, I'm not a snob, but I can't exist on a diet of American Pie and Three Stooges all the time, y'know?).

Anyway, without trying to overdo this article- the film looks great, the bonus features are interesting, the only slight gripe is with the packaging.  I don't like paper/cardboard DVD or Blu-ray cases, personally, but considering the price is right, I'd say this film is worth it.",1363392000,,709,4.8347107438016526

168133,4,0800141709,"First, let me say that this is visually a remarkable movie. The way this movie was shot really put it up in the stratosphere. The special effects alone were remarkable for the time period. The movie had a major effect on movies like it for years to come. Movies from War Games to Under Siege had the huge war room that has now become ubiquitous in all movies of this genre. The handheld cameras that were used to capture the assault of the air base was remarkable! It may have been the first time they were used in such a manner to give the movie viewere a POV of a battle.

The motion picture itself is a farcial satire that Americans enjoyed in 1964. Today, although dated in the sense of 1960s geopolitcs of its time, its theme still holds its own as of this writing. Substitute Communists for terrorists and you get my meaning.

I enjoyed the DVD extras. However, I agree with James Earl Jones in his assertion that some of George C. Scott's performance was a bit over the top. Too, Kubrick cut out a pivotal scene where Jones's character questions their orders to hit Russain teritory.

I give this movie Three and a Half Stars. It was somewhat crass and pedantic, but still holds its own quite well visually. For the time period it must have been truly innovative.

Ok, I'll be the 69th Four Star review and the 570th overall.

168165,4,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, 1964 film

The story begins with talk of a ""Doomsday Machine"" sited on a fog-shrouded island. Next we see B-52 bombers flying high above the clouds (while the credits roll). We see a computer center with tape drives. ""Condition Red"". The base is sealed due to a shooting war. Private radios are confiscated. The Strategic Air Command keeps bombers constantly in the air in case of a sneak attack. One bomber receives a coded message: Plan R. Its confirmed. A general is buy with paperwork. The base can't be contacted. Is there a mistake? Soldiers are warned about the enemy, they can be disguised. That bomber opens its orders to drop a nuclear bomb on an ICBM complex. One radio is brought to Commander Ripper. Is something wrong? Is war too important to be left to the generals? The President is warned about this unauthorized action. Did General Ripper exceed his authority?

""Plan R"" allows a lower-level commander to initiate action. Can they be recalled? NO! Is General Ripper psychotic? A military force is sent to contact Ripper. General Turgidson recommends launching an all-out attack. Is he insubordinate? The Russian Ambassador was called to the War Room. They try to contact Premier Kissoff at a private number. The President talks to him about a terrible event. What can they do? ""I'm very sorry."" ""Do Svedanya."" The Doomsday Machine is operational. General Ripper warns about drinking water that isn't fresh and pure. The Doomsday Machine can destroy all life on the world! Ripper warns against fluoridation in water and food. Outside the shooting continues, then stops. Ripper goes to the washroom for privacy. One bomber is targeted by a missile. It hits! Its radio had been damaged and is inoperative.

The low-flying bomber can't be detected by radar. Captain Mandrake dials the President via a collect call. No, he needs the right change. Can the Colonel get it? The recall code is sent and acknowledged. All the bombers are recalled, except one. Will its bombs set off the Doomsday Machine? There is a hitch on that one bomber, it will select a new target. They turn on the settings to arm the bombs. The bomb doors remain closed. Do they need a manual intervention? The Major makes it work! Dr. Strangelove uses a slide rule to calculate the number of years to remain underground to avoid nuclear radiation. [How reliable are those estimates?] This is followed by pictures of nuclear explosions. It's the end of the world as we know it! [The flaw in the one man to ten woman plan is that it created inbreeding and genetic defects.]

This movie satirizes the Mutual Assured Destruction policy of nuclear warfare. It shows how ""rational decisions"" are flawed when based on lies and mistakes. Who really wanted to create multiple nuclear bombs and bombers? Weren't bombers less efficient in bomb delivery compared to rockets? The Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles became obsolete when they were replaced by low-flying stealth missiles. But these depend on satellites to receive directions. An upper atmosphere nuclear bomb would create an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) that would destroy transistorized electronics (like a close lightning strike). Modern machinery would fail to work as well as the supply systems. This would be comparable to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy to the Jersey Shore but would be all over the world.

However once was enough for m. Now I know where the quotes come from.
Its pretty memorable, some classic scenes, and the quality of the writing, acting and staging is good. The stereotypes are hilarious. In fact, the whole plot is hilarious.
I believe it was made to lighten the tension during the 'world might blow up into nuclear war at any time' mindset of the 1970s when we in the rest of the world just took it for granted that some loony American and loony Russian might well both get to be leader at the same time, get into a posturing match, push the red buttons, and all of us round the world would suffer the nuclear fallout. But then the Berlin Wall came down and there was Perestroika and we all stopped worrying about the Bomb without having to learn to love it.

Stanley Kubricks genius shines through in this movie, even given the fact that the B52 scenes were a little hokie, although, from what I understand, he was not given permission to use actual footage of B52's by the U.S. Air Force at the time. Also, CGI was not available yet.

168261,5,0800141709,"If we omit ""Fear and Desire,"" an early film that Stanley Kubrick removed from circulation, and his short films and documentaries, the director made only 12 movies in his career. But what a dozen they are! Kubrick was not the most prolific of directors, but to me, he was the greatest.

Although I love all his films, there are several that stand out: ""Paths of Glory,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" -- and ""Dr. Strangelove."" Given those five films, an affectionate companion and a desert island, I could be reasonably content until the end of time.

""Dr. Strangelove"" is essential Kubrick because it is nearly perfect in its conception and its execution. Think of it -- a comedy about nuclear holocaust in 1964? Kubrick was far ahead of his time. This isn't the only oh-no-we're-nuked movie that has stood up well; others include ""On the Beach,"" ""Testament"" and even the TV movie, ""The Day After."" But it's the only one that dares play it for laughs.

Despite the comedy, however, as you watch it, the sense of menace becomes real enough. Kubrick's re-creation of the War Room is a dark, cavernous place where even the most outrageous ideas and statements are not only tolerated but, for the most part, condoned. It was always our hope, as citizens living in the nuclear age, that our leaders would be people of reason, intelligence, restraint. Here, though, Kubrick depicts a roomful of madmen. The only thing in question: Who's craziest?

The cast is outstanding: Peter Sellers in three different roles including the titular one, Slim Pickens, a young James Earl Jones, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, whose preoccupation with Americans' ""precious bodily fluids"" leads the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of World War III.

My first viewing of this film was this: I was a kid, not yet 10 years old. I saw just a fragment of it, including the end. Maybe 10 minutes, tops. I asked my dad to explain it to me. He just started laughing ... and then did his best. Even that brief exposure to it left me disturbed for a couple days.

168271,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film DR. STRANGELOVE is a hilarious film about the nuclear annihilation of the human race. Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his  B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.

Originally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, DR. STRANGELOVE became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly betweeen Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War II.

Filmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time.",1338076800,,1806,5.220689655172414
168272,5,0800141709,"Peter Sellers plays three characters in this unique film: (1) Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF, on loan to U.S. General Jack Ripper in a officer trade program. (2) U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and (3) Dr. Strangelove himself. You will also no doubt recognize George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and a very young James Earl Jones.

General Jack Ripper has gotten ""a little funny,"" as President Muffley puts it, and gave the order for the Strategic Air Command (planes always in the air) for Plan R, which was intended to be the American response if the Soviets had blown up Washington and higher command (presuming including the President and the Joint Chiefs) were unavailable. A ""disclaimer"" at the beginning of the film states that the U.S. Air Force assures us all that it could not happen like this.

Anyway, General Ripper not only set the planes carrying nuclear weapons to bomb Russia, he cut off all communication from his base to the outside world so that no one could countermand the order. Only he had the code which could recall the planes.

Much of the action takes place in the Pentagon war room, where a huge map displays the paths of the SAC planes as they head for targets in Russia. I'd ruin half the fun of the humor if I told you too much, but suffice it to say that this movie puts forth the obvious fact that nobody -- not generals, not politicians, not anyone -- was prepared to cope with this kind of an emergency. Except Dr. Strangelove, of course. He has an idea for everything. Now if he can only remember to stop calling the president ""mein fuhrer.""

One wrinkle occurs when the Soviet ambassador is called in and talks to the Premier on the hot line. He discovers that the Doomsday Bomb will be automatically triggered if any of these planes reach their targets.

You wouldn't think the destruction of the world would be funny, would you? Still, when you hear General Ripper explain to Captain Lionel Mandrake why he did it (""our precious bodily fluids""), and then see Keenan Wynn soberly warn that if he obeys Captain Mandrake and shoots the lock off the Coke machine to get change for the pay phone so he can call the President, the Captain will have to ""deal with the Coca Cola Company,"" you just can't help laughing. There are hundreds of laughs in this movie, just to show you that annihilation of the planets human and animal life is indeed a laughing matter.

Try to believe the Air Force's disclaimer, and learn to stop worrying. After all, the Soviets are no more, so we don't have to worry about the bomb anymore, right? Isn't that right? Sure it is!",1337126400,,2623,4.594017094017094

168276,5,0800141709,"A long time ago, nuclear attacks weighed heavily on most American's minds.  Many had bomb shelters stocked with water and food.  Many I'm sure refused to live in or near Washington D.C., thinking that would be target # 1.  There was a moment in history where this country was at the brink of losing it all.  Thank goodness now-a-days this is not the threat it used to be.  Granted, there are now new strains between this country and Russia about nukes, but the hands of the nuclear clock are no where close to where they used to be.

This film in a serious and humorous way shows the dangers of nuclear arms, and what happens when we stock pile them.  It shows that safety measures can be circumvented and we all could theoretically be plunged into nuclear winter in no time at all.

**Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film focuses in on one B-52 airplane, commanded by none other than Slim Pickens himself.  The plane gets orders to bomb Russia from America and to go into radio silence.  Any transmissions sent to the plane are to be regarded as enemy trickery.  Thus the plane goes on a suicide mission into Russia to drop all their nukes on an unsuspecting Russia.

The President and his war counsel are soon notified of this horror and learn the plan has been master-minded by a mentally unhinged General.  The General thinks Russia is somehow ""Corrupting the bodily fluids of America"" and must be stopped.  He's nuts to say the least.

Peter Sellers plays 3 roles in this movie, all funny and different.  He plays the President, a British Soldier over here in America on an exchange program, and Dr. Strangelove himself.  Strangelove is a former Nazi scientist, and sometimes unwillingly hales hitler.  He appears to suffer from ""alien hand"" snydrome, an extremely rare condition where a person's hands will act on their own accord, and even attack the owner of them, i.e. your own hand can try to strangle you.  This makes for some hilarious scenes where Strangelove is fighting his own arm and trying to keep it from saluting the Fuhrer.

Things escalate and you the viewer are not sure what's going to happen.  To make matters worse, Russia is revealed to have a device that will launch all their nukes if even one is dropped on them.  To make matters EVEN worse, they have fortified their nukes with a new available element, that makes them pack even more boom.  Bottom line if Slim Pickens and his crew succeed in their mission, the world's gonna end.

Once the film is over you are left laughing, BUT thinking.  How horrible would this be if if actually happened?  What safety procautions are currently in place to avoid this?  Would our President actually do this?

Not many films can make you laugh and think at the same time.  You have to love Kubrick and his films.  I have never seen one yet I've hated.  The man had the unique talent to make each one different.  He literally never repeated himself, and always strived to make his next film not even an echo of his last.

A must see for anyone who proclaims themselves a film buff.  You can not be a film expert without seeing this masterpiece.

Well...that's my 2 cents worth.  Now if you'll excuse me, my left hand is attacking  me...adlkakj;dlkajd....help!!!",1336003200,,3223,4.628975265017668

Kubrick's black comedy of 1964 about the cold war and the arms race is only 'outdated' at first glance. Ok, the cold war is over, most of it. Arms races are temporarily on hold, until further notice (after all, the opponents of deficit spending will never oppose a proper military budget, will they). But: just listen to insane General Jack D. Ripper's conspiracy theory about fluoride additives, or to General Turgidson's ravings about armament gaps in comparison to the Commies, and you will rather easily recognize their various contemporary brothers in arms. Either of them would stand a chance to win the reptiliannomination.

By the way, there is a frequent misconception that Peter Sellers plays the madman in this film. Not so. Sellers plays some of the rational people here (the RAF officer who tries to stop the Ripper, and the President). He also plays the clown, Strangelove, Merkwuerdigliebe, an amalgam of all hijacked Nazi scientists. He is just crazy. Harmless.
Brilliant acting by Sellers in his 3 parts, and by George C.Scott as Turgidson (who is said to have been unhappy with his character.)

It's a classic film, of course, of the end of the world brought on by cold war politics and nuclear weapons.

The classic scenes of this movie are too many to recount, but one of my favorites is of the character, Dr. Strangelove, being able to finally get up from his wheelchair, salute his new Fuhrer, the president of the United States, screaming ""I can valk, my Fuhrer!"" as he contemplated having ten nubile young women assigned to him as the upper political and military establishment planned to live in a deep coal mine to survive the nuclear holocaust and nuclear winter. The black humor back in the early 1960's was especially dark as many of us went through the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, a heart-stopping case of Life imitating Art.

A new audience of younger viewers with no direct knowledge of the Cold War and the MAD strategy [Mutual Assured Destruction] may still enjoy this movie as we all contemplate a slower moving, all encompassing doomsday machine called Global Warming and Climate Change. This Doomsday Machine is not fiction and is a global phenomenon which will affect us all.  Perhaps a new generation of movie makers can satirize our present predicament as Stanley Kubrick did with the Cold War, and make us all fully aware of the dangers that lie ahead for the planet.",1326326400,,1696,5.29368029739777

It captures the bleakness of nuclear war, the hypocrisy of military, and really gives a brilliant satire of the cold war.  All of the small jokes that you catch the second or third time through such as the airforce base using the slogan ""peace is our profession"" or the miniature combination bible and Russian phrase book.

First I must say I did actually see this in the theater at the age of 11 with my parents when it was released. I was awe struck then and have always felt the same each time I've view it over the years. There is really nothing more I can add about the brilliance of Kubrick, the cast and crew in making what I consider one of the best movies made that hasn't already been said in the many reviews posted here.
My wife had never watched Dr. Strangelove and a few years ago I rented it for her...Well she was totally amazed at what this film brought to the table in terms of content and character.
So after I put together my home theater system earlier this year, Dr. Strangelove was one of the first titles I wanted to pick-up in Blue-Ray. After reading a lot of the debate going on in the reviews about the aspect ratio I was becoming greatly confused on which version would actually be the best one to buy...I finally gave in to the BD release with many of the special extras included (the had cover book with many of the movies photos was very nice, though I wished they had provided some sort of protective cover to slip over it).
I am so glad I did go with the BD version, even after all the talk back and forth about the different aspect ratio thing. The contrast level and deep blacks are exceptional. The film still has that bit of grainy quality to it, but I believe it was intended to be that way, it was still very sharp and clear and I didn;t really see anything cut off from the screen. The sound quality is quite good and comes out wounedful on my 5.1 surround sound. If you play Blue-Ray one will not be disappionted with this version. For anyone on the fence thinking about purchasing this, now is a great time to buy. The price is much lower now than when I bought it a few weeks ago and it's a terrific deal for what you get.

That was the only reason I grabbed this off of the shelf.  This movie is one of the rare films that gets better every single time you watch it.  The dialogue is crisp and fantastic.  I have a digital copy on my Zune and have LISTENED to this film a dozen times while on road trips.  I just slap on my headphones and listen, laugh and quote dialogue to myself.  My wife thinks I am crazy.

This is the story of one maniacal Air Force general who authorizes his planes to nuke the Soviet Union. After he gives the go code, and refuses to call them back, the rest of the film follows 3 groups of people, the general and his RAF counterpart holed up in the office on the base.  The army is trying to get to the general to get the recall code.  The RAF commander is trying to get the insane general to give in. We also have the B52 bomber flown by Major Kong on its way to deliver the payload (Kong is the one from the iconic image of the pilot riding the nuke as it plummets) and my favorite arena, the Pentagon.  At the pentagon we have the President and his closest advisers, including Buck Turgidson and the titular Dr Strangelove. George C Scott as Turgidson is phenomenal.  His facial expressions, mannerisms, and overall insanity play perfectly in this nuclear satire.  While Strangelove is the ex nazi scientist who is helping America to win the cold war.

There are so many fantastic parts, lines, innuendos, and visuals in this film, it would take too long to mention them all.  Just please, watch the film.

On the DVD you can see inside the mind of the 1960's Hollywood marketing team.  The Trailer is awkward at best.  What was nice was the ""interviews"".  IN the 60's they used to tape answers to questions from the cast for a split screen interview. Then they would have their local entertainment reporter ""ask"" the questions and it woudl look like Peter Sellers was talking to your hometown guy.

168332,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick was a director of many faces. His films always had that distinctive look. His films dealt with the consequences of war (Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory), human evolution & alien intelligence (2001: A Space Odyssey), a descent into madness (The Shining), and an analysis on humanity & free will (A Clockwork Orange). While most of his films are based off of novels from Stephen King, Anthony Burgess, and others, Kubrick mostly moved away from the primary sources and put his own artistic qualities into them. Out of all the novels, I have read only ""A Clockwork Orange"" (which is ironic since I've never seen the film just yet, but I hope to see it as soon as possible), and judging from author's reactions (the most obvious being Stephen King), it's quite clear that Kubrick had a different vision with each of the novels that he adapted onto the big screen. With Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb, it's yet another loose adaptation, but I'm not here to complain about the director's calculated and eccentric process.

Inspired by the novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George, this black comedy was created in 1964, and was seen as a daring attempt to bring humor into the thought of a nuclear war. Knowing that this film was made in the middle of the Cold War, it's even funnier forty-five years later. This is not toilet humor. This is dark political humor that's incredibly ironic and satirical. There are so many classic scenes (""Be careful, Mr. President. I think he's drunk.""), that it's simply hard to describe all of them in just one review. Straight to the point, this is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. It has a great ensemble of actors (Sellers, Scott, and Pickens steal the show), a bold script, amazing black-and-white cinematography, and, as I've mentioned earlier, numerous memorable scenes. Now granted, this film isn't for everybody. Those who are not into politics may not be interested, but those who are willing to see a 60's black comedy that's fantastically modern would no doubt find this one entertaining.

168338,4,0800141709,"The Film:

Kubrick's best film? Tough to say. 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and Spartacus are pretty darned good. One of the best dark comedies of the 20th Century? Easily. Probably the single best. Consistently, some times uproariously funny, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is an indisputable classic. It expertly weaves the paranoia and fear of the period with phenomenal comedic performances, to both funny and chilling effect. Peter Sellers is absolutely stunning in this film, as is George C. Scott. The nuclear farce escalates and escalates throughout the 90 minute run-time, ultimately culminating in... well, I won't spoil it.

Simply put, this is one of those films everyone should see before they die.

The Blu-Ray:

This is a tough disc to review. The movie is so incredibly good that it might be blinding to the flaws in the presentation. And flaws there are.

The first one that will strike anyone who's seen this film before on home video is that this film is not presented in the 1.33:1 ""academy ratio."" Instead, it is cropped to a 1.66:1 ratio which is very close to today's widescreen TVs, with *very* slender black bars on the sides.

Now, I'm as big a fan of widescreen images as the next guy. But I'm an even bigger fan of seeing everything the director intended me to see, i.e. the original aspect ratio of a piece of film. Apparently, when Sr. Strangelove was transferred to laserdisc, Kubrick told Criterion that the film is supposed to switch from 1.33:1 to 1.66:1 aspect ratios, depending on scene. In the war room, for instance, the lighting above and some binders below the 1.66:1 frame were intended to be seen. Since this disc is fixed at 1.66:1, the image never opens up to show us this information. Is it story critical? No. But it could have been present, given the existence of other Blu-Ray discs that switch aspect ratios on the fly. It's too bad that it wasn't done here.

Another potentially problematic aspect of this transfer is video noise. I am a big proponent of film grain being presented realistically in a HD image. I don't want it scrubbed away by excessive ""noise reduction."" But this image strains my tolerance. Static backdrops and human faces positively swim with noise, much of which looks more ""digital"" than true ""analog"" film grain. I truly wonder whether a projected film print would have this kind of noise. Again, some sort of happy medium should have been achieved.

OK, bad news out of the way, I can still say that this is a highly watchable transfer. Blacks are much more solid than the previous DVD, and detail in some scenes is good (but not great). For a 45 year-old b&w presentation, this looks pretty good. It's not at the level of the recent ""Casablanca"" or ""Seventh Seal"" Blu-Rays, but it certainly holds its own.

Audio is presented in a 5.1 channel mix, as well as the original mono. The surround mix is pleasant, splitting some of the info (such as gunshots or airplane noise) out into the rear surrounds.

Extras are mostly carried over from the most recent DVD edition, with one new documentary included, and the film trailer tragically absent. It was a GREAT trailer, very 60's modern and cool. Really sad and kind of inexplicable that it was left out. The docs are presented in 480p, which is kind of lame. The ""commentary"" is a combination text overlay/video interview trivia track. Unfortunately, the text overlays pretty much half of the screen, making it tough to catch important parts of the film. The videos are interesting enough, but they talk over some key parts of the film, and some of the truly outstanding performances are obscured. Overall, the track is more irritating that it's worth, and I would have preferred a new 1080p documentary to it.

************

If you don't already own this, buy it. Just buy. Don't think. It's amazing, and an absolute must-own. Any of the above issues will not really matter to someone who doesn't own another edition. This one will do just fine.

If you do already have the more recent DVD edition, this is a tough recommendation. The picture quality is certainly better. There is more detail, better black levels, and fewer artifacts such as jagged edges and edge enhancement. But you're going to get a cropped image that may not square well (so to speak) with your recollection of the film you've seen before. And you'll be missing out on the classic trailer, in exchange for yet another superfluous documentary. So it's not really an upgrade. It's more of a lateral move from the DVD.

I still give the disc 4 stars. The film is 5-star material all the way. The BD presentation has some serious flaws, but it still is highly watchable and has a fair amount of value.",1250121600,43,4676,4.749691738594328
168339,5,0800141709,"I regard Dr. Strangelove as THE best Stanley Kubrick movie of all time.  Peter Sellers triple role is amazing.  George C. Scott actually agreed to do this movie to make an attempt at comedy in his career.  I believe he pulled it off quite well as Gen. Buck Turgison.  Sterling Hayden's portrayal as Col. Jack D. Ripper is unbelievable.  I think one of the best scenes is when Ripper is in his office and asks Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (one of three Peter Sellers roles) to make him a drink of grain alcohol and rain water.  Then he lights up this huge cigar and inhales a massive drag of smoke and looks into the camera with the smoke curling around his face.  THAT was Kubrick's money shot right there, and then of course we the audience, find out exactly how stark raving mad Ripper is when he rambles into his diatribe about the massive commie plot to sap and unpurify his precious bodily fluids.  I have watched this movie hundreds of times, and each time I laugh just as hard.  The lunacy of it all and to think that Kubrick was laughing in the government's face in 1963 when this film was made !  Right smack in the meat of the Cold War, and this movie comes out.  I remember my Dad was in the Air Force then, and this movie was actually BANNED around the WASH DC area where we lived at the time.  Now THAT is a statement on Kubrick's art and mastery as a film maker. I love this movie, and wish more film makers had the balls Kubrick did in '63 when this was made.",1249689600,,1475,4.247311827956989

One of my favorite lines of the film is when he tells the General and Russian Ambassador:
""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!""
The supporting cast is stellar as well; George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are excellent as the war crazed and psychotic generals. Slim Pickens is outrageous as he rides his bomb to oblivion. The innuendo throughout is quite amusing because you have to be quick to pick up on them, like the names of characters, phallic images and so on. The idea of ""Nuclear Armageddon"" has aged little with the passage of time, even after the Cold War has ended. The way this film holds up today is incredible (and judging from our current relations with North Korea, couldn't be summed up better than with this).",1248739200,,1046,4.481675392670157
168341,1,0800141709,"After years of glowing positives, the movie turned out to be pretty bad when I finally saw it. Itching to eject after a few minutes so as  to get on with something more meaningful in life (like caulking my bathtub), I did sit through it to see what could be salvaged.  The passage of events has aged this movie terribly.

The method of the satire in this movie is to (a) take people who fought the Cold War, (b) put them in a contrived situation, (c) have them state many of their beliefs (from concerns about government mandated fluoridation to nuclear policy) in a bizarrely unrealistic context created by the film-makers so as to make them look foolish.

The beliefs themselves  aren't analyzed. Fictional events are instead arranged to make them look nutty by association.  You are quickly taught who to laugh at on cue, like conditioning Pavlov's dogs. If someone has idea X, you know you are supposed to laugh at them and that's approved.

It is the approach of lazy pseudo-intellectuals everywhere.  This movie shows the tedious shape of modern liberal thought, bigotry, and prejudice in the process of forming, before it ravaged the country in the late 60's down to the present, degrading hundreds of millions of lives along the way.  Same thing with Sarah Palin and Saturday Night Live; instilling conditioned reflex responses so people don't have to think.

Since history and Soviet archives have shown the Cold War architects to have been correct in their assessment of just about everything (i.e., McCarthy was right), the mocking in ""Dr. Strangelove"" just looks foolish.

It's the sort of movie people who want to appear sophisticated go to and say they liked to get in with the ""enlightened elite"" for having ""correct"" thinking.

Dr. Strangelove himself is a minor character, having ~5 minutes of material out of 1.5 hours.  Apparently the joke with him is that he can't control his arm, which keeps wanting to ""Heil Hitler"" salute, etc., as he discusses plans with generals and President.  I don't know why that's funny or interesting.  It's boring and stupid. Sort of like Monty Python -- if you think MP is clever and deep like most 12 year olds, you'll like Dr. Strangelove.

Many interesting and thoughtful things could have been done about the Cold War, the effort to halt an ideology bent on enslaving the world to the will of an elite that thought itself better and more enlightened than everyone, but was really just a systematically defective understanding of reality.

Dr. Strangelove is an echo of this elite and their defective understanding of reality trying to lull asleep the masses they despise, by trying to  mock and ridicule people who correctly acted against them to all of our benefit.",1248048000,26,2721,4.852813852813853

168356,4,0800141709,"I found ""Dr. Strangelove"" to be a well-created, dark comedy. Certainly, the major theme of the film was quite clear. The acting was also very, very good. Additionally, the names of the characters is another fascinating study: President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, General Jack D. Ripper, etc.

The dangers of nuclear war being presented seriously through a comedy is an additional positive. The film convey the idea that the USA and USSR have the power to basically destroy the world as we know it through nuclear war. The film also criticizes the Cold War policy of amassing large numbers of nuclear weapons to create stakes so high as to prevent war, since it would lead to inevitable worldwide destruction.

Basic Plot:
Mentally ill, Jack D. Ripper (obsessed with fluorine being a Soviet poison that affects sexual ability) authorizes a nuclear attack through Plan R (nearly impossible to reverse). In response, the Soviet's have their own ""Doomsday Machine"" the would go off in the event of an American nuclear strike and was impossible to reverse.

Comedy:
The peace sign during the assault on Ripper's base, and Dr. Strangelove's Hitler references were entertaining as were shooting the Coca Cola machine to receive free coins to pay for a phone conversation.

Political Science Aspect:
Unfortunately, I do not think the film offered any alternatives to the Cold War. For example, what was the United States supposed to do with its nuclear weapons? If we simply destroyed them, what assurance would we have that the Soviet Union would do the same? Do we take on the attitude of absolute faith in the goodness of humanity? I just do not think so.

For Today:
For example, in 2009, do we expect North Korea and Iran to stop their nuclear desires because nuclear war could permanently cripple our world? How are we supposed to deal with potential narcissistic dictators who wish to acquire nuclear weapons? Maybe the best thing in today's society is for our nation to have a sufficient nuclear capacity to tell a hostile nation that if they nuke us, we will annihilate their nation. In this form, the U.S. and its people will just have to have confidence that no 'accident' will happen.",1245283200,4,2194,4.918918918918919

168358,5,0800141709,"It was a time of turmoil in the world.  There was the threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, how fatalistic Americans were during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US involvement in the military conflict in Vietnam was starting to heighten and tensions were high.  Director Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a thriller on a what if there was a nuclear accident.

Using Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"" (written back in 1958) as a source to write his film adaption, his knowledge of nuclear war after reading over 50 books on the subject, after the Cuban Missile Crisis started to become a growing concern with Americans, Kubrick wanted to give a unique perspective and not make things so grim.  He immediately decided to change the screenplay which was more of a serious thriller into a black comedy.

Needless to say, his decision to do so has made ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" a classic film that was ahead of its time back in 1965 and has so much relevance in today's modern world.  The film was well-written as the film is a satire on the political system, sexual themes (which the names and the characters and their role in the film plays a big part of the film's theme and their manhood) and most importantly the Cold War.

The film's storyline and even what went on behind-the-scenes to create the film are two very interesting stories and now, fans and new viewers who have been curious about this classic film and what went on behind-the-camera can experience it all on this 45th Anniversary Special Edition via High Definition on Blu-ray.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition"" receives its first High Definition transfer ala 1080p (aspect ratio 1:66:1).  With the outcry of videophiles of how a classic like ""Patton"" was heavily DNR'd (Digital Noise Reduction), the good news is that Sony didn't go that direction.  So, with the Hi-Def transfer, you do see a lot more detail but also you see the grain of the film quite strongly at times (moreso in the B-52 sequences).  But there are scenes that look absolutely awesome.  Where the images look pristine and blacks are nice and deep with no sign of compression artifacts.  Overall, this is the best transfer of the film to date.

As for audio, ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition"" is presented in English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and also its original English mono audio presentation).  For the most part, the audio is primarily dialogue-based but when you get to the action sequences as the US military fight each other, machine guns and blasts are heard quite nice and clearly.  In fact, the military standoff featured good use of the fronts and rears and good directional of audio and hearing the soldiers scream from different areas.

The film utilizes the front channels quite well and again, dialogue and even the very few music used in the film comes out quite clearly for a film that is 45-years-old.  And ""Dr. Strangelove"" does sounds great for a film that was made in 1964.  But by no means is the sound going to be as immersive as a modern war film on High Definition but for a film that is 45-years-old, it sounds great.  So, the fact that this classic film has received a lossless soundtrack is a major plus.

As for subtitles, English English SDH, French, Arabic and Dutch subtitles are included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As basic as this summary is, there is so much detail in the writing of ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" that it is one of those films to watch and just be in awe of.  From the performances of Peter Sellers (playing multiple characters) to George C. Scott (who didn't know that he was being filmed during his run through of scenes) and just the amount of thought and detail that went into the creation of the film.

Director Stanley Kubrick went through many nuclear war books (over 50) and read quite a few of them several times in order to immerse himself and gaining the knowledge he needed in creating the film, finding certain situations of that time that seem absolutely frivolous now but actually did happen during that era and crafting characters based on other characters but giving everything a satirical spin.  The results are magnificent and just brilliant!

At first, when hearing General Jack D. Ripper wanting to go to war due to fluoridated water.  I thought such a thing was preposterous but then I learned that the John Birch Society at that time thought it was a conspiracy by the US government to introduce fluoridated water into the system.  Also, to learn that the ""Doomsday Device"" was not a far off idea, that a scientist had proposed a Cobalt Bomb that would act like the Doomsday device and annihilate all human life on the Planet.

I was really amazed by this film and it definitely gave the viewers this unique perspective that Stanley Kubrick had at that time but giving it a comedy spin.  You have to remember that during that era this film was released, the threat of nuclear war and everyone dying from it was very real.  The political tension between the Kennedy Administration and the Russians was very real and very tense.  So, for this film to put a comedy spin into nuclear war was probably unheard of.  So, needless to say, it was a film ahead of its time and has so much relevance today.

The Blu-ray release of ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition"" is absolutely fantastic.  You are literally getting your money's worth because the special features included are lengthy, informative and really go into the behind-the-scenes creation of the film and setting up the tension of that Cold War era.

For those that own the 40th Anniversary DVD Special Edition (released back in 2004), you may be wondering if its worth the double dip.  Personally, I would have to say yes because of the High Definition transfer and lossless audio.  You also, get the Blu-ray exclusive ""The Cold War: Picture-in-Picture and Pop-Up Trivia Track"" which is very informative and a booklet.  But if none of these interest you, then you are safe with the original DVD Special Edition release.  (Note: The DVD Special Edition release does come with a theatrical photo and advertising gallery not included on the special features of the Blu-ray edition).  With a release for it's 40th, and now it's 45th, there is probably a big chance we will see another release 2014 for a 50th Anniversary Special Edition.

But for Blu-ray fans who have been wanting Kubrick's films on Blu-ray with a 1080p High Definition video transfer and lossless audio track, you can't go wrong with this release because it's quite solid and definitely worth having in your Blu-ray collection.  ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: 45th Anniversary Special Edition"" is highly recommended!",1245110400,21,9805,4.794642857142857
168359,5,0800141709,"I finally got a copy of this universally reputed movie, after many of its characters and themes already enticed my curiosity through the years, and, basically, as I wished not to miss such a milestone in Peter Seller's career (being a staunch fan of him as inspector Clouseau). Well, I have been pleased and over-pleased by every minute of the movie, and found Seller's acting over the top. The sadistic smile of Strangelove while describing mass-destruction or the ""unfortunate"" case of a women/men 10-to-1 ratio in the post-atomic scenario were pure delight. But Sellers is not the only star shining in the movie. Praise be also to Kubrick's hilarious plethora of funny (but meaningful) names, from U.S. generals Jack D. Ripper to Turgidson, to the soviet ambassador De Sadesky and premier Kissoff...
And what more smartly funny than the mocking of the then well-known Cold War vocabulary, as the ""peace race"" or the ""mineshaft gap""? Obviously, that's not a movie to be easily understood (and thus enjoyed) without some knowledge of contemporary history, politics and even military doctrine (the automatically-triggered apocalyptic reaction was less theatrical than one could think nowadays, in contemporary military conceptions, and the pre-emptive strike funnily described through Turgidson's delirious suggestion was about to be launched in at least two occasion in real history), but given the high level of Kubrick's productions this is just the masterpiece one could expect from such a director.",1245110400,,1503,5.345991561181434
168360,5,0800141709,This movie should be required viewing for everyone. Not enough superlatives. Watch it over and over....Every time you watch it you will find something new. Genius - funny - The entire cast is amazing.,1244851200,,200,4.911764705882353
168361,5,0800141709,"You must have a good understanding of humor and satire to watch this movie. Kubrick is very delicate with the material and satire, not as discreet as American Psycho or as openly funny as American Beauty, but this movie has a dark bite to it that can keep you laughing on 4th, 5th, and 6th viewings. I am currently getting ready for sevenths. This film has 2 great reasons to admire Peter Sellers, a couple of great reasons to applaud the serious Slim Pickens and of course the marvelous George C Scott. This is a movie that only gets better with age and launched a new face for comedy. A must buy for a lover of film, comedy, and war.",1240790400,,635,4.3
168362,5,0800141709,Awesome movie full of classic one liners.  Great acting performances and a young James Earl Jones! Slim Pickens is hilarious! Highly recommended,1238803200,,144,5.545454545454546
168363,5,0800141709,"In 1964 the first of the ""bomb"" movies came out. Kubrick further earned his place in the pantheon of film greats with his all-time classic ""black comedy,"" ""Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Love the Bomb"". Explaining how a movie that ends in the world obliterated by nuclear (actually hydrogen) holocaust is a comedy leads me to suggest watching it. Only then you will know. The iconoclastic Kubrick made an iconoclastic film starring the extraordinary Peter Sellers in three roles. He plays the President, a lily-livered liberal in the mold of Adlai Stevenson. He plays Mandrake, a British Royal Air Force officer, and he plays Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist based on Werner von Braun, although some of have suggested that they see in the madman Henry Kissinger. Kissinger was not well known when the script by Terry Southern (who later wrote ""Easy Rider"" but died destitute) was turned in.
The premise is that an Air Force General, Jack Ripper (most of the characters are given descriptive names), played by the Communist bohemian and Sausalito weed smoker Sterling Hayden, goes mad. He is convinced that because water is fluoridated the Communists have conspired to deprive red-blooded Americans of their ""essence,"" their ""vital bodily fluids""...their semen. For this obviously stupid (believed only by right wing wackos) reason, Ripper overrides Air Force protocol and orders his nuclear attack wing to bomb Russia back to the stone age. Of course this is meant to show that the military is filled with lunatic fringe elements with their hands on the button. In an interesting bit of terminology, the words Soviet Union are never uttered, only Russia, presumably to ""humanize"" all those agrarian reformers. Thought I hadn't caught that, huh? Anyway, real-life pacifist George C. Scott, playing General Buck Turgidson, discovers Ripper's plan. He is another Curt LeMay take-off, bombastic and filled to the brim with sexual testosterone that seemingly can only be released by his bikini-clad girl Friday, or by bombing the Russkies to smithereens.
A plan is hatched to inform the Communists how to shoot down the wing, in order to prevent nuclear holocaust. Turgidson thinks that is a terrible idea and that as long as the boys are on their way, they should drop their payload on the bastards. The Russian Ambassador, however, puts a crimp in those plans by informing the President that this would set off a Doomsday Machine, guaranteed to destroy all life on Earth. Turgidson laments the fact that there is a ""gap"" between the Soviet possession of such a device, which the Americans lack, no doubt due to liberal malfeasance. Forced by the Doomsday scenario to avoid holocaust, the Americans and Russians work together to shoot down all the U.S. planes, save one. Meanwhile, Ripper kills himself and his aide de camp, Mandrake/Sellers, discovers the recall code. But the last plane, piloted by good ol' boy Slim Pickens, is as Turgidson/Scott describes, wily enough to evade radar, while damage from a heat-seeking missile has rendered it unable to receive the recall. They make their run. Pickens makes his cowboy speech about going ""toe to toe, nuclear combat with the Russkies"" and emphasizes the crew, including a young James Earl Jones, is due commendations ""regardless of race, color or creed."" With Pickens personally releasing and riding his bomb into a Valhallic destiny, the deed is done, leaving the Doomsday shroud to envelop the Earth. All is not lost, however, because Dr. Strangelove/Sellers, messianically saluting the President as ""mein Fuhrer,"" describes how mineshafts can be converted into underground government societies for the next 100 years. The boys all smile when Strangelove says that in order to further the human race through procreation, many more attractive women than men would have to be recruited to do ""prodigious sexual work."" Unfortunately, monogamy would have to be a thing of the past. The end.
""Dr. Strangelove"" may be one of the 10 greatest movie ever made, but its comic message was clear: The military is not to be trusted, nuclear weapons serve no good purpose, and the Soviets are likely to be victims of our aggression. Like a number of movies, however, its political message is stilted. Reagan said it was his favorite(...)",1233878400,3,4285,5.105413105413105
168364,5,0800141709,"I didn't get around to seeing this movie till I was almost thirty. I figured it would be another stupid overrated ""classic"" but instead I found out it's exactly the brilliant piece it's hailed to be. Peter Sellers is amazing here with his trio of performances, filling the screen with his virtuoso presence and embodying three characters who could not be any less similar. This is one of the funniest, scariest, most insane projects ever committed to film.",1230681600,2,456,4.858974358974359

Many presidents even saw the movie and have used it as an odd reference point.

The behind-the-scenes companion DVD is just as much of a treat as the film itself: the set designers made educated guesses as to the interior of a B-52 bomber, and turned out to be so accurate that the Air Force got concerned and Stanley Kubrick was worried that the FBI would come after him; Peter Sellers was originally set to play the Slim Pickens role in addition to the President, Group Captain Mandrake, and Dr. Strangelove -- but a dispute with Kubrick, Sellers own near-exhaustion from playing 3 other roles, plus an ""accident"" all conspired to allow Sellers to bow out as the B-52 commander, and in came Slim Pickens in perhaps the most memorable film role of his career.  Pickens, as Major Kong, upon being told by his radio operator they've just received orders to bomb the Russians in reponse to an attack on the United States, responds: ""Well I been to one World's Fair, a picnic and a rodeo, and that's the stoopidest thing I ever heard come over a pair of earphones!""

168369,5,0800141709,"What can I say that hasn't been said already?  This is a comedy about a grim subject but WHAT a comedy.  The characters are literally to die for.  Obviously Peter Sellers in his many roles is terrific but it's tough--even for Sellers--to top his truly odd character, Dr. Strangelove.  Strangelove's previous work for the Nazis has left him with a strange schizophrenia in which is right hand, quite literally, doesn't know what his left hand is doing.  It's constantly flying up in an attempted Nazi salute and, by the end of the film, like the B-rated horror flick ""The Hand"", tries to strangle the confused Dr. Strangelove.

Slim Pickens is equally great as the hilarious cowboy B-52 pilot who, overcoming all odds, Russian and U.S., flies his bomber in low, fast and deadly to deliver a nuclear bomb fated to--indirectly, at least--destroy the world.

Then there's Sterling Hayden with his obsession with the purity of his bodily fluids, women and Communists.  Sterling has figured things out, though, and 'punishes' women by depriving them of his bodily fluids.  He also lauches the nuclear strike doomed to--yep--set off the Russian ""Doomsday Machine"" that will utterly demolish the earth and all life upon it.  Great fun.

168370,3,0800141709,"This comedy is about the dangers of our nuclear age. Doctor Strangelove is a spoof about the insanity produced by those who concentrate in seeking power, for power corrupts and absolute power has a tendency to corrupt absolutely.

General Jack D. Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, is after purity of bodily fluids and wants to rid the world of Communism, therefore he orders a squadron of bombers to penetrate Russian soil and eliminate key places to destroy this enemy of the free world.

The President of the United States, played by Peter Sellers, who by the way, plays several roles during this film, from the war room, gets involved in negotiations for peace, and the give and take is simply... hilarious. Simply love when he says: ""you can't fight in the war room, that behavior is unacceptable in the war room."" Peter Sellers is also the British soldier who attempts to prevent the bombing of Russia, and the bomb-maker, the... Strange-love Doctor.

We realize that the movie must have been seen as a daring move during its release, but today, we have gone beyond the fear of making the bomb, to the realization that at anytime... we are in danger of taking weapons to the point of self-destruction.

168372,5,0800141709,"In this day and age, during these times of political uncertainty, a black comedy such as `Dr. Strangelove' is a welcome distraction.  It takes all of our fears about what our own society may come to and it throws it in our face with enough humor (scarily realistic humor) that we find ourselves laughing at what could possibly be our eventual future.  Stanley Kubrick has been my favorite director for some time now, and `Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is quite possibly his finest film (I still have a warm and fuzzy place in my heart for the anti-warm and fizzy movie known as `A Clockwork Orange')

The film centers around panic in the white house when General Jack D. Ripper acts on his own accord to eradicate Communism by launching a squadron of B-52 bombers over the Soviet Union.  When the Soviet reacts by threatening to use their Doomsday Device the President finds himself in the middle of heated debate on how to handle the current crisis.

The film is littered with jabs at politics in general, with the country's fascination with war and the crazy ideas floating around the heads of the men in power.  Taking a more subtle approach to the films humor, Kubrick's gem of a film fairs much greater than most other parodies like `Blazing Saddles' (I need to stop hating on that film) for it actually manages to make all of its jokes work.  The film is genuinely hilarious, but it never sacrifices its intelligence for a quick laugh.

Kubrick has a wonderful bedmate in Peter Sellers, who previously worked with Kubrick on the equally subtle yet effective comedy `Lolita'.  Sellers takes on three separate roles in this film; the President, Captian Lionel Mandrake and the bomb maker Dr. Strangelove.  He dominates this film by creating three completely different characters with different ideals and even accents, and he nails each one.  He's aided by the hilarious George C. Scott (who makes those `war room' scenes unforgettable) and Sterling Haydem, who captures the realness of human insanity.  These actors create such real, yet exaggerated characters that give the film such authenticity within its humor.

The scary thing about `Dr. Strangelove' is that, in all honesty, it's probably not that far fetched.  Today more so than ever the general public has a pretty good idea of just how manipulative and chaotic our world leaders really are, so when watching a supposed comedy like `Dr. Strangelove' it becomes more and more dramatic as we put the pieces together.  I remember feeling the same way when watching the more recent `Wag the Dog', another political comedy.  They always say that reality makes for the best comedy because real life is almost always unbelievable; and this film is a real case-in-point, for it is as funny as it is scary.

In other words; it's funny cuz' it's true.",1222732800,3,2846,4.811088295687885

168377,1,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)

I've always found it somewhat amusing that when it comes to Stanley Kubrick's movies, I dovetail almost exactly with everyone else I know. If you ask Kubrick fans what their favorite Kubrick films are, you will get the almost universal answer of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove. I finally saw the former all the way through for the first time a couple of months ago, and it was just as bad as I figured it would be from the pieces I'd seen. Now, I've seen the latter, which I again assumed would be terrible based on what I'd seen of it; unlike 2001, though, in this case I'd actually underestimated how thoroughly horrible this movie is. (And, for the record, of the Kubrick movies I've seen-- I'm still missing a few-- my two favorites are, by far, The Killing and Lolita.)

Critics back when it came out, of course, immediately compared it to Fail-Safe, the other 1964 film about the War Room. It was inevitable, really. The main difference between the two films is that Fail-Safe plays it straight and goes for tension, while Dr. Strangelove goes for satire. The biggest problem is that the satire just isn't funny. It's the same tired old antiwar message crap we've heard a million times before. There's no thought given to characters or plot at all; it all exists for the sole purpose of poking fun at anyone who's not a hard-line antiwar activist. (Reportedly, Peter George, upon whose novel the film is based, despised it-- probably for that reason.) There is no attempt at subtlety here, no attempt at artistry. There are many attempts at humor; all of them fail. Now, I grant you, they might actually be hilarious, but I couldn't tell; I was too busy reeling from getting hit in the head with the antiwar hammer over and over again.

And by no means is it a ""guilty pleasure"" - it has every right to be listed among the top films of all time.  After all, the very qualities that make it my personal favorite are qualities that make this movie truly stand out above the majority, critically.

This is a movie that should be shown in every film school in order to teach the ingredients necessary to make a truly great motion picture, for you could analyze any one facet of the film, be it the directing, the acting, the cinematography, and write a thesis paper on it.  From a directing standpoint, you have Kubrick's incredible attention to detail and perfectionist eye; and you have his masterful ability to bring out the best in his actors.  From an acting standpoint, you have Peter Sellers and George C Scott at their absolute best - which is a bold statement.  You also get a perfect example of how to take a small budget and not only tear down the illusion of its limitations, but actually achieve complete freedom from a modest financial backing.  This movie takes place in about four different spaces and not once is it limited by this, but in fact, greatly benefits from it.  The craziness, the claustrophobic paranoia, is only heightened by the surroundings.  You have a script of sheer wit, a powerfully funny, almost dangerous, satire that manages to use abstract absurdity to clearly drive home a very clear, real danger - Or in other words, it is a satire that achieves its purpose absolutely.  You have a story set in a specific moment in world history, but a story beyond setting and to the heart of the human spirit - in all its fallacy, craziness, and absurdity - Which leads me to the very thing that has sold me on this film in the first place: the sheer entertainment factor of it all.  You can analyze this film to death, but you cannot avoid how downright entertaining the whole production of Dr Strangelove is  - the sheer genius of Kubrick's part was making this adaptation into a satire in the first place - for recognizing the insanity of political power and understanding that laughter is sometimes the best means to express horror.  He has never been more on the money, regardless of how incredibly effective his other films have been, as well.

It's the other characters, especially the base commander, the President, George C. Scott, et al who have become more realistic over the years, therefore more scary to me. Remember, in 2007, the United States flew nuclear weapons right down the center of the country, leaving them unattended on a Texas airbase,This morning's Presidential budget includes $70 billion in new defense spending; this despite various sundry plans to ""wind down' overseas.

168395,5,0800141709,"Regarding the review cited as the ""most helpful critical review,"" in which the main criticism is that the aspect-ratio of this DVD is 1.66 throughout instead of ""variable"" (some shots 1.33, some 1.66), I'd like to put to rest the unfortunate idea that Kubrick ever intended this film to be seen with a ""variable aspect ratio.""
Yes, the film was photographed that way; but no, it was not meant to be seen that way.  Let me explain:
""Variable aspect-ratio"" seems to be a term invented to market an early DVD release of ""Dr. Strangelove.""  The term has no meaning in the film industry because no film has ever been released that way (except for that misguided ""Strangelove"" DVD -- a mistake which has now been corrected).
Most of ""Dr. Stangelove"" was photographed with no matte in the camera, thus exposing the entire 1.33 film frame.  Many shots, however, were filmed with a 1.66 matte, reflecting Kubrick's intention to release the film to theaters in 1.66.  Therefore, if you transfer this movie to tape using an unmatted film element, and you take the whole 1.33 frame for every shot, the aspect ratio will vary between 1.33 (shots filmed with no matte in the camera) and 1.66 (shots filmed with a 1.66 matte). But it seems self-evident that this is not the way any movie was ever intended to be seen, with the shape of the frame randomly bouncing around from shot to shot for no reason.
So why shoot it that way?  Because Kubrick (and his cameraman) knew that one of two methods would be employed to ensure the aspect ratio of the theatrical presentation: either the theatrical printing negative, and therefore every release print sent to theaters, would have the 1.66 matte printed-in from start to finish, or each print would be shipped with written instructions for the projectionist to put a 1.66 matte in the projector gate.  Either method would result in a consistent 1.66 aspect ratio from start to finish, and both methods were commonly used in the days when theaters projected 35mm film prints, before digital projection.
Is it possible Kubrick shot it ""variable"" so that the eventual 1.33 DVD release could have a meandering frame-line?  I know Kubrick was smart, but it's unlikely he was thinking of the DVD release in 1964.
In those days, movies were made for theaters; televised movies were mainly 16mm prints, edited for time and sold in syndication.  The TV market as it existed in 1964 did not influence any film director's compositions.  The theatrical release was all that mattered; and the theatrical release of ""Dr. Strangelove"" was 1.66.  All of it.
Therefore, if one wants to see this film the way Kubrick meant it to be seen (and a new, matted 35mm print is not available), the film-to-tape transfer must recreate the matted 1.66 theatrical aspect-ratio throughout -- which is what the ""40th Anniversary"" DVD and of course the BluRay do (thank you, Sony Home Video).
I oversaw film restorations for a major Hollywood film studio for more than a decade, so I know the subject of aspect ratios pretty well.  Hope this info is helpful.",1193788800,773,3057,4.7927756653992395

168403,5,0800141709,"_Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ (1964) is a darkly comic and disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick.  The film is regarded by many as one of the greatest classics of all time and satirizes the ludicrousness of such notions as Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) and the horrors of nuclear war.  The film was made during the height of Cold War hysteria and shows the sheer lunacy and idiocy of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in their attempts to build ever greater weapons of mass destruction.  The film also shows the lunacy of scientists and generals who operate behind the scenes and plan to unleash these weapons upon an unwitting populace.  The film is meant to be a black comedy and thus features many absurd components which serve only to re-inforce in the mind of the viewer the horrible matters being presented in such a light-hearted manner.

The movie begins with the lunacy of General Jack D. Ripper, who believes in a communist conspiracy to destroy the ""bodily fluids"" of the American people through fluoridated water.  Ripper decides to strike the Soviet Union with a nuclear attack and manages to do so without the authorization of the president by making use of a special emergency plan known as ""Plan R"".  The film then focuses on the men flying the plane which is set on unleashing this weapon upon the Russians, showing the conflicts that develop between them.  The film also features Peter Sellers playing Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, who serves as an important executive under General Ripper and tries to dissuade him from the attack.  The film then focuses on a special meeting of the president and his generals in the ""War Room"".  (One particularly humorous and memorable line from the movie occurs when the president makes the comment to one of his generals and the Russian ambassador that there is to be ""no fighting in the War Room"".)  The president notifies the Russians of the attack in an effort to thwart the attack and thus prevent a full scale and destructive nuclear war through the Russian ambassador.  Unfortunately, as it turns out, the Soviets have devised a ""doomsday device"" which upon the destruction of their own missiles will completely obliterate all life on earth.  Thus, the president must attempt to call back the U.S. aircraft which plan on unleashing this destruction before it is too late.  The film also features Peter Sellers as the Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove who periodically alternates between giving the Nazi salute and addressing the president as ""Mein Furher"" and ""Mein President"".  Dr. Strangelove explains to the president how the doomsday device is to work and also offers up the possibility of an escape by a few selected people who will live under the earth in mines.  It should be pointed out that Dr. Strangelove is believed to be an amalgamation of the ex-Nazi scientist Werner von Braun and Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb.  The film ends in a very disturbing manner as this terror is unleashed upon the world.

This film remains an essential classic and is ranked by many as among the greatest of all times.  The message of the film is quite disturbing in that it shows how mass lunacy may break out and a nuclear war result.  Through the actions of madmen within the United States military and government, a nuclear war is made inevitable.  For those who lived under constant threat of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, such a possibility was a distinct reality.  Thus, while the film attempts to make light of this issue, underlying this humor is an all-too-disturbing reality.  This film is to be highly recommended to all thoughtful people who struggle with the notion that individuals in power continue to wield weapons of mass destruction and that they may be unleashed upon nations at any time.  While the Cold War is supposedly over, such weapons still exist and their reality remains all-too-apparent.

168404,5,0800141709,"""In the days after it first opened in early 1964, Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" took on the enchanted aura of a film that had gotten away with something. Johnson was in the White House, the Republicans were grooming Goldwater, both sides took the Cold War with grim solemnity, and the world was learning to be comfortable with the term ""nuclear deterrent."" Roger Ebert

I purchased the 40th Anniversary CD and this is my third or forth viewing, but ""Dr. Strangelove"" seems fresh and undated - an irreverant satire. The willingness of the Director to follow the film to its conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has that special touch Its black and white photography is in particular important for its portrayal.

General Ripper orders the B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. When the British military attache, Peter Sellers, tries to stop him, Ripper explains the plot to ""taint our water supply and deplete our ""precious bodily fluids."" He won't even discuss the re-call code. Eventually, he realizes he will be caught and he ends his game. Events on the Army Base are mixed with the War Room in the Pentagon. President Muffley learns from Dr Strangelove and the Doomsday Machine. It appears that neither the Doomsday Machine nor one of the U.S. bombers can be turned from their missions.

""The movie's screenplay, by Terry Southern turn this scenario into a dark comedy of errors, illuminated by flashes of brilliant satire. Some of the dialogue has entered the language - ""precious bodily fluids,"" of course, and also the way the dim-witted Col. Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) hints darkly of Commie ""preverts."" The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British attache, who does not have the correct small change to call the White House and save the world, is one of the movie's best-constructed gags."" Roger Ebert

The acting in this film is superb, in fact it would be very difficult to top this crew. Sterling Hayden is the epitome of a paranoiac Gen. Ripper. George C. Scott, however, steals the movie and is brilliant as, Gen. Buck Turgidson, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Peter Sellers, as President, as Dr Strangelove and RAF Group Captain Mandrake h portrays the epitome of humor, satire and acting. Maj. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens), is perfect in the role of the pilot. His exit from the movie, riding a bomb like a bronco, remains one of the most famous moments in modern film, and is my favorite scene from the movie.

""When you consider the history of motion pictures, certain watershed films leap to min. Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove. As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago."" Bosley Crowther

This film shows that it is possible to laugh and to laugh continuously at a shocker of a film that is filled with satire. It is only when Slim Pickens is riding the bomb do we realizae that this could be real. There But For The Grace Of God, Go We.

168429,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, like most black comedy, finds its humor in the fact that there is really very little humor to be found in the situation it presents.

Mankind, in trying to secure peace (through Mutally Assured Destruction-type nuclear deterrence), manages to completely bungle every step, accidentally dropping a hydrogen bomb and causing the triggering of a Doomsday Device which will force us to live in caves for a hundred years.

What's funny about that? Nothing. And, of course, everything.

The funny thing about it is that it's so true--humanity really is that inept and bumbling; we really could ""oops"" our way into a nuclear winter--and we're left with the options of laugh about it or give up in despair. Movies like Dr. Strangelove allow us to see the ridiculousness that we continually create and ""find the funny"" rather than anguish.

Specifically, we're shown the hyper-paranoid mentality of the Cold War, with all of its suffocating rules and fail-safes (with the eventual result that no one is able to call back the planes sent to bomb Russia, because no one has the proper authorization). Hilariously, though, we're shown that the paranoia has a *basis*, as the Russian Ambassador snaps spy-photos of ""the Big Board"" when the Doomsday Device has already been triggered and surely such espionage has lost all meaning. We're shown how our well-meaning public officials (represented by the President) are at the mercy of testosterone-fueled, cereberally-challenged Generals and insane scientists culled from Hitler's government (with the Nazi inside always threatening to come out).

Dr. Strangelove, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and nuclear arms race, shows how humanity, in everything it does or tries to do, always manages to muck things up in the most hideously, and appropriately, ironic of ways. (""Peace Is Our Profession"" read the signs of the Air Force Base, as the gunfire rings out and the bombers fly towards their targets.) Dr. Strangelove tells us to accept all of this, smile, and ""stop worrying.""

Beyond the general purpose of black comedy, and Dr. Strangelove's particular topic, this is a wonderful film. Brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. Peter Sellers is, as you think he might be, a stand-out, wonderful in all three of his roles (and the first two times I watched this movie, I couldn't even tell that all three were the same man), and so is George C. Scott and the rest of the supporting cast.

This is my favorite of Kubrick's collection and my favorite black comedy.

As one final note for this five-star comedy, I wonder if Dr. Strangelove will, over time, lose its appeal to the newer generations. They will not have grown up during the Cold War, and they will have missed out on that era's particular fear of and obsession with The Bomb. Perhaps, if Dr. Strangelove loses its relevance and appeal to succeeding generations, that will be a good thing and signal progress? We can only hope for the best.",1175731200,,2957,4.995934959349594

When Dr. Strangelove came out, it was a breath of fresh air that if we continued to trust the ""military solution"" we were indeed doomed to annihilation.

Unfortunately we did not learn from history and were to repeat our military bombing solutions.  More bombs were dropped on Vietnam than all of WWII.  Over 4 million Vietnamese were slaughtered in the name of democracy and capitalism.

Once again today in Iraq, Iran, etc etc, we are told the solution to people disagreeing with our lifestyle is to bomb and kill them into submission, to make the world safe for democratic dictatorships and American businesses.

Scott then Peter Sellers.  Nothing can be more torturous to a person that the pangs of remorse which a guilty conscience can force upon him/her.  Some scholars and intellects with consensus among the father of my children and I believe the ultimate pangs of in United States governmental policy TODAY exists in the hidden agenda of remorse for releasing the 'nuclear zone' on the world in the prologue of the past while promotiing nuclear 'free' misunderstandings now in fear of retaliation for what the United States alone deliberately and democratically caused?  This genocide and holocaust masqued by end of war agreement between bi-polar personalities of Russia and America at very end of WWII when all knew so-called conventional warfare [and very little at that] was much more in now forgiving the taking of 650,000 innocent lives of women and children and old men unable to die for their cause.  The movie is not such a dark representation as reflected by these words but the impact is equal to the juvenile, trite societal constructs of entertainment even now [2007] in the realm of nuclear proliferation?

168451,5,0800141709,"""Dr. Strangelove"" is one of the greatest dark-comedy anti-war films ever produced. I remember when I was assigned to SAC [Strategic Air Command] for nearly two years, that our motto ""Peace Is Our Profession"" seemed a bit odd. As did others in my unit. Both at the time, and looking back many years later; while I protected Nuclear Weapons Convoys from the air in a helicopter as a machine gunner, I thought how horrible the world would have been had these weapons ever been unleashed. Thankfully the Officers and NCO's I served with did not have the same mentality that the film depicts with these characters. This film is without a doubt one of the greatest dark-comedies ever made. I don't know how many times I have seen this film, yet I always find it hilarious. And a bit scary too!

Peter Sellers and George C. Scott are just terrific. Stanley Kubrick made a film that will be seen for generations to come. The social satire of the film must have been something when it was released in the early 1960s. The character I found most hilarious in the film was that of the late actor George C. Scott. His portrayal as the militaristic General, who seems not to have too much of a problem with the B-52 launching directed towards Soviet Russia, must have come straight out of a chapter from former General Curtis Lemay. Now that was one dangerous general. Also, Sterling Hayden's portrayal as the rogue general who sets off these chain of events gave a stellar performance. I know most people remember the role of Slim Pickens riding off as a cowboy on his missile, but for me the most memorable scenes dealt with George C. Scott. He was just outstanding in his role.

And Peter Sellers' multiple roles were just great. I thought that his portrayal of the president was hilarious, and he reminded me a lot of former Senator Adlai Stevenson. At least I got that impression from his acting performance while he is trying to divert a Nuclear holocaust while he is in the war room. Since I was around these weapons many times, and knowing that these weapons are still around, with their awesome destructive power they can unleash at anytime, still makes one think about these weapons: Especially at the height of the Cold War. Audiences must have had a huge laugh with this one. My mother tells me that when my father took her to the theatre to view the film; people were either hysterical with laughter, or left the theatre upset. Wish I could have seen it.

168455,5,0800141709,"For me, this movie is both classic in a theatrical sense and in a personal way. As the daughter of a Hitler historian, I spent my childhood listening to my father discussing not only 'Der Fhrer,' but the opposite end of the spectrum in Josef Stalin. He discussed the Cold War in depth with me, and by the time I was in middle school, I knew more about the Red Menace that most of my classmates combined. For me, however, the Red Menace was almost like a joke--the Cold War was over, communism didn't have a good foothold anywhere, and it seemed like the end of the story.

When Dr Strangelove was made, however, the Cold War was still in full swing. All of those things that Daddy told me about the belief that there was a communist infiltration of water systems, the B-52s sent to watch over the USSR, all of that was still going on. There was an insanity, a paranoia, a distrust of people and institutions that could only be found in a post-war society such as 1960s America. This translated into a fabulous comdie  l'humour grinant, one which could never be replicated and yet still resonates with Americans under the current administration.

After years of watching this on small screens, I had the great pleasure of seeing it with a large group of people (including my father) at the Belcourt in Nashville this past weekend. This treasured movie, watched many times, became something completely different on the big screen. Hearing other people laugh at the absurdity of the characters and situations just made the movie seem all the more fabulous. Whether laughing at something as asinine as the name Bat Guano or some masterful move by Peter Sellers, the community was electrifying. This movie is something that can be savoured by intellectuals of all types from the political sciences major who was sitting behind me to the ex-Air Force pilot a few rows up.

I noticed that it had been produced in England. And I would have had a hard time imagining any studio in America back then permitting such an irreverent movie to be made in this country. Yet even Bonzo Headrest Reagan had seen this movie had asked where the War Room was after he was elected president. There was no ""War Room"" in real life. It reminds me of a famous anti nuclear poster in the 80's that could be interpreted as either insulting to Reagan or Breshnev!
I had seen the trailer where they said that Stanley Kubrick had read 50 books on the subject of nuclear war in preperation for this movie. I'll bet Hal Lindsey did not read that many books as background research for his bestseller THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH!
The Cold War paranoia stuff about the Soviets was hillarious! I remeber myself in 7th grade in 1972 that I would not sing WHEN I'M 64 by the Beattles because I myself thought rock music was some sort of communist conspiracy! Although it is true that they did not let rock music into Russia until after the Cold War, so said Van Halen or David Lee Roth! So, maybe there was something to this. But the things that they say about the Soviets is so ridiculous you know it is all just a farce!
Generally, I also believe that the end of all things is near as the Bible says. So, why not go out with a laugh?

I had studied in German in college that the US Army had recruited a bunch of former Nazi missile scientists from Peenemunde. But that guy is a real nut job as many scientists in real life are! I had to laugh hard when he kept giving that raised arm Nazi Roman salute to the American President as though he was saluting Hitler-""Mein Fuhrer!"" Maybe some of our presidents remind me of Hitler, too!
Dr. Strangelove had talked about hiding enough people in underground mines to wait out the nuclear armageddon to insure the survival with society. In TIME  magazine in 1992, I had read a story about Mt.

Why? Well, there are different reasons to say that, but I think I'll point out only those that I deem more important:

1- To start with, even though this film was made in 1964, director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a timeless masterpiece that depicts, in a sardonic way, the dangers of nuclear war. The message of this movie still comes across as valid, albeit nowadays for different reasons.

2- Secondly, even though the subject is undeniably serious, this movie is a black comedy that makes you laugh. If that is difficult to believe, take into account that the plot involves a crazy general (Sterling Hayden) that sidesteps the chain of command in order to launch a nuclear airstrike on the URSS, something his aide (Captain Mandrake, played by Peter Sellers), the President (played by Peter Sellers!!) and many of his advisors (including Dr. Strangelove, a scientist also played by Peter Sellers) try to stop. But will that be possible? And what about the Soviet ""Doomsday Machine"", that will be triggered automatically by any nuclear attack on Soviet soil?

All in all, I think this is the kind of movie you simply must watch. Highly recommended  :)

STRANGELOVE suffers from bouts of self-indulgence that blunt the otherwise razor-sharp sardonic humor and keep it from being just shy of 5 stars.  Mercan Muffley as a name?  I know the hidden meaning behind it, but it's an inside joke among better, more accessible joke names that fit, such as Premier Kissoff, and as such it doesn't add anything except an odd puzzlement until you finally discover the meaning.  The same goes for Bat Guano.  Worse, neither name is funny nor sardonic.  Mercan Muffley simply stops you to scratch your head; Bat Guano hits you over the head.

I first saw this movie some 35 years ago and never cared much for the Dr. Strangelove character either.  Whereas Generals Ripper and Turgidson and Major Kong are brilliant spoofs of their targets, Strangelove is too overdone and too self-indulgent.  Same goes for the subtitle:  ""How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.""  No one I've ever met uses the full title.

Other than those minor complaints, the rest of the film is a classic for a good reason.  Its brilliance is in its mockery of human vices and frailties that are somehow made all the more real by their outlandish portrayals.  Having served a few years in military aviation, I especially appreciated the B-52 crew and their scenes, which often get overlooked in reviews of the film.

It's a classic.  Now that I have the DVD, I'll pull it out once a year or so, skip the weak spots, and enjoy the rest.",1152748800,4,1619,4.6879432624113475
168462,5,0800141709,"The 1964 black comedic masterpiece from director Stanley Kubrick centers around the dropping of ""THE BOMB"". A surprise nuclear airstrike on the USSR is ordered by a crazy General (Sterling Hayden), leading Captain Mandrake to frantically attempt to locate the recall code to stop the bombing.

With an all-star cast of outstanding performances, Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, James Earl Jones, Sterling Hayden & Keenan Wynn, you can't go wrong. Peter Sellers shines in three different roles- Captain Mandrake (General's Aide), the President of the U.S. and the President's advisor (ex-Nazi scientist) Dr. Strangelove.

Nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Peter Sellers) & Best Screenplay Adaptation this is one of the top 10 greatest cult classics of all time.",1152230400,2,821,5.456692913385827
168463,5,0800141709,"It is the midst of the Cold War, and America has Russia surrounded by B-52 bombers each equipped with a H-Bomb, just in case. A psychotic, fluid and fluoride obsessed general (Sterling Hayden) one day decides to let them fly, and gives the command to the pilots, which he does without the permission of the President. This sends the US government, deep within their war room, into a panic. Will the President (Peter Sellers), with the help of the creepily grinning Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers), be able to stop the H Bombs, or will the world be obliterated in a Nuclear holocaust?

This is the world of ""Dr Strangelove"", Stanley Kubrick's 1963 film. This dark satire at the time was a very topical film, and a film I've been meaning to see for some time, being interested in Kubrick and a fan of Peter Sellers. I'm really glad I managed to get a hold of this DVD and see it. It is a very witty, well thought out film.

The acting's pretty interesting. The characters of the politicians and generals are often pretty petty, not the kinds of people you'd want handling a dire situation like this, but they aren't exactly parodies, they try to keep their serious face on, you could see politicans and generals acting like this in such a crisis. For a film whose plot involves politics, protocols and special aircraft controls, it's very easy to understand and to follow. It could have been a lot more complicated, but its not, and the satirical parts get to shine through. The aircraft controls, for instance, which are vital plot elements, are clearly marked and given their own shots. Though times have changed since 1963, I wouldn't say the film has dated that much either.

On this version of the DVD, there's a nice little selection of special features. Theres a featurette called ""The Art of Stanley Kurbrick"", which briefly documents Kubrick's early life, his first job as a photographer, and his films up to ""Dr Strangelove"". There's a meatier, 45 minute documentary called ""Inside The Making of Doctor Strangelove"" which documents the production and controversies of the film. It was interesting to discover that the set for the B-52 cockpit was so accurate, that Kubrick was confronted by the FBI. There's a few little tidbits like this, and its fascinating. There's also a ""split screen"" interview with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers, where the screen is split in half, and the actor gives pre recorded answers to scripted questions, which a presenter of the show reads, appearing on the other side of the screen (though in this feature it is blank and there is no one). I have never seen one of these kinds of interviews before, apparently they happened quite often at the time, and it was intriguing to watch. I particularly like the Peter Sellers part of the interview, which he does with his President character's accent, then goes on to discuss and act out accents of the English speaking world, shifting fluidly from one to another. A talented guy. There's also a picture gallery of promotional material (original posters, lobby cards, etc), some talent profiles, selected filmographies of the cast and Kubrick and the very original 1960s trailer with its ever flicking frames and words, which is just as quirky as the film.

Highly recommended to fans of Kubrick and lovers of satire.",1151539200,4,3304,4.801405975395431
168464,5,0800141709,"Perhaps the most subtly funny dialogue I can think of in a movie ever.

This movie is the quintessential mockery of Mutually Assured Destruction.  Humanity's capacity for reason is so great that the products of reason, atomic bombs, can wipe out the very existence of every rational creature.  That this fact is harrowing is clear enough.  That this fact is funny is difficult to fathom, but the absurdity which such a comic insight requires is captured so beautifully in this movie.  No one is so great at being the caricature of a war-monger as George C. Scott.  No one is as capable of making the absurd seem real as Peter Sellars.  Every little detail of the film takes some swipe at the politics and social idiosyncracies of the early 1960's and late 1950's.  I still get kicks out of the famous line: ""Gentlemen, please! I won't allow any more fighting in here, this is the war room!"" If I have botched the exact phrasing of the line, it is only that I've adopted into my own vocabulary as a great example of sarcasm and irony.  The Cold War is funny in a very serious way.  It is not trivial, but ferocious.  This is the type of film that makes the audience renew their contact with the politics of the period and laugh at its very serious implications for the current day.  Satire does not get better than this.",1146182400,3,1374,4.473895582329317
168466,5,0800141709,"It's funny, I've seen 3 previous Kubrick movies before this: A Clockwork Orange, the Shining and 2001. Only the Shining I liked as Clockwork seemed kind of boring and 2001 seemed really slow at times. Dr Strangelove is one of the few that I like and although I didn't find it a laugh riot all the way through, its satire and funny dialogue was perfect, and the performances were great as well.

An Air Force commander goes nuts and convinces a fleet of planes that Russia is planning an attack so he calls for an action to nuke them. The film switches between 3 locales mainly: the War Room with the President and other government officials, the crazy commander and a soldier trying to get him to stop and inside the plane, on their way to bombing Russia.

The performances are quite excellent with George C. Scott playing quite an animated Officer while Peter Sellers plays no less than 3 roles: the President, Mandrake, the officer trying to stop the rogue commander and Dr Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist in a wheelchair. Then of course there's Slim Pickens who replaced what was supposed to be Peter Sellers' 4th character as Major Kong. Also look for James Earl Jones, later being of course the voice of Darth Vader.

One of the most well-known images of the film is Major King yahooing on the nuclear bomb all the way down to annihilation. Whether this was the first time that a big vertical tracking shot was shown but it sure seems familiar now. Pearl Harbor's infamous shot, the boulder in Return of the King and even the end to Temple of Doom had similar shots so either this was the start or it was another homage but it's certainly a famous shot.

It's best if you go with the Anniversary Edition since the image is more cleaner. I watched the SE and there was print flaws all over the place. There's a couple new features which probably doesn't seem like much but for the best looking, get the Anniversary edition.

It's certainly a funny movie and a well-made one and Kubrick, who is usually known for precision and coldness rather than emotional films, it's nice to see one that I actually like.",1145836800,4,2112,4.576719576719577

Buy this movie and I can guarantee you it will not set on your shelf and get dusty.

This movie should be one of the top ten war movies of all time.  Why?  This movie correctly captures the feel of the late 1950s and early 1960s when there was a massive fleet of jet bombers which would attack the Soviet Union.

Personally I thought that George C. Scott should have received a best supporting actor award.  There is a scene in the ""War Room"" where the president of the USA is giving the flight paths of the attacking bombers and the look on Scott's face was priceless.  George C. Scott, as General ""Buck"" Turgidson, is one of the funniest actors in this movie.

Colonel ""Jack"" Ripper, the insane commander of the SAC base that declares war on the Soviet Union, is clearly modelled on contemporary USAF commanders.  These idiots would run around saying the USA could win a first strike war on the Soviet Union.  Sheeze.  Russia lost over 20 million when Nazi German launched an attack.  Then Russia had to endure our generals.  The malevolent way that Colonel Ripper chews his cigar is enough to make a sane person to never seriously consider smoking.

The B-52 crew flying on station does capture the aircrew boredom of that period.  Jets would fly in lazy formations and their crews would do anything to keep from dying from boredom.  What the movie can't tell a viewer is while this duty was deathly boring it was deadly dangerous.  More than one aircraft and its thermonuclear weapon were lost on these flights.  However, I digress from the main point.  The movie correctly shows the men reading a Playboy to pass the time.  They were less politically correct back then.

When the attack orders come in they are greeted with initial skepticism.  ""That the dumbest thing I've heard"", roars Major ""King"" Kong played perfectly by Slim Pickens.

The briefing on the ""USAF survival packet"" that is given in the B-52 does correctly show the absolute insanity of that period.

Peter Sellers gives a great performance in this movie.  He has three parts.  However, his best movie part is of the ex-Nazi war criminal ""Dr Strangelove"".  ""Und Animals could be bread und SLAUGHTERED"" Dr Strangeloves advises the President when talking about the post war survival options.

This movie is a classic.  It could be among the top ten war movies of all times but can't be because it's fiction, a dark comedy, and involves a non-existent nuclear war from the early 1960s.",1140480000,2,2464,4.691588785046729
168484,4,0800141709,"Every 40 years I try to watch Dr. Strangelove, just to be sure that I didn't miss anything earlier, so last Saturday was it.  It's still a good show, and it's still amazing how influential it was in '65 & '66.  Its antic, manic repudiation of Cold War conceits and of militaristic pieties helped push many of us into nihilism.  Vietnam made it easy to loathe the military (Clinton's words) and to see even good men as Rippers with a happy face.

But repudiation isn't refutation.  Now I think Strangelove was mostly wrong about the Cold War & military power;  we nihilists were mostly wrong about Vietnam.  But rather than refight the last bad war, here are some apropos Cold-War notes:

Stanley Kubrick's nightmare fantasy Dr. Strangelove was worryingly close to a real doomsday scenario.  A US commander goes mad and orders an attack on the Soviet Union.  No one can call back one of the bombers ...

(F)our hydrogen bombs from the B-52 [that collided with a midair refueling tanker at 30,000 feet over Spain in 1966] fell to earth around the village of Palomares.  Although the safety devices prevented a thremonuclear explosion, the high explosives in two of the bombs went off;  radioactive particles were scattered over several hundred acres of farmland.  A third bomb landed intact near the village.  The fourth landed in the sea.  [It took an intense search of 80 days to find it.] ...

On 26 July 1957, while practicing a touch-and-go landing [in England], a US B-47 bomber crashed into a storage depot housing three nuclear bombs.  Blazing jet fuel threatened to ignite the TNT in the trigger mechanisms of the bombs, but fortunately firefighters extinguished the blaze. ... The event was kept secret until news of the accident leaked in the early 1990s.

On 24 January 1961 a B-52 bomber came apart in midair over North Carolina, and two 24-megaton nuclear bombs were released as the bomber fell to earth.  One bomb parachuted to earth and was recovered.  The other landed in waterlogged farmland and was never found. ... (W)hen the recovered bomb was examined, it was found that five of its six safety devices had failed.  North Carolina was saved from a nuclear explosion a thousand times more powerful than that at Hiroshima by the one remaining safety system.

On the afternoon of 21 January 1968, a ... B-52, carrying four hydrogen bombs, crashed into the ice seven miles away from the Thule [Greenland] base and exploded.  Although the safety devices prevented a nuclear detonation, the conventional high explosives in all the bombs went off;  radioactive debris was scattered over a large area. ...

Even more terrifying were failures of the complex systems developed and designed to respond to a nuclear attack and to trigger retaliation. ... At 4:00 AM on 26 October [1962], at the height of the [Cuban missile] crisis, unknown to Washington an Atlas ICBM was launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in southern California.  The missile was not armed;  its launch was a test that had been scheduled some time earlier and, due to bureaucratic imperative, had not been cancelled.  But Vandenberg was on DEFCON 2 alert status, so other missiles there had been fitted with nuclear warheads.  Had the Soviets detected the launch of this test missile, they could easily have imagined that the firing was for real.  Their response might have been to order an immediate nuclear retaliation against the United States.  Again, at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, the first squadron of Minutemean missiles was about to be deployed when the Cuban crisis erupted.  In the haste to get them onto alert, we now know, several routine safety procedures were overlooked.  Miswirings or short circuits could have led to an inadvertent missile launch.  Moreover, the crews who were rushed into taking charge of their deadly payloads had not been fully trained or certified for these launchers.

In the tensest moments of the missile crisis, ground defence forces at all US air bases were vigilant against sabotage attempts by Soviet agents.  On the night of 25 October, an air force sentry on patrol at a base near Buluth, Minnesota, spotted someone climbing over the perimeter fence.  He fired at the intruder and counded the alarm for sabotage.  At bases throughout the region a series of synchoronized alarms went off.  But at Volk Field in Wisconsin the wrong alarm was triggered.  A Klaxon was sounded signalling that nuclear war had begun.  Pilots ran to interceptor planes fully armed and primed with nuclear weapons.  These men, who had been told there would be no practice drills during the Cuban crisis, immediately started their engines and started towards the runway.  Fortunately, the base commander had checked with Duluth and ordered an officer to drive his car into the middle of the runway and flash his lights to abort the takeoff.

Back in Duluth it was discovered that the suspect intruder was a bear.

The most chilling incident of all took place on 27 October 1962, the Black Saturday of the missile crisis, the day on which both sides felt that a nuclear confrontation looked unavoidable.  Just before 9:00 AM radar operators at an advance warning station at Moorestown, New Jersey, were carrying out a regular check of their computer systems.  They inserted a software test tape in which a simulated missile attack from the Caribbean activated an advanced level of alert and then aborted the system automatically, after assuring that all responses had been correct.  At the exact moment the Moorestown operators inserted their software test tape, a ""friendly"" space satellite crossed the horizon from the direction of Cuba.  According to the command-post log, the computers and their operators ""became confused"" as to what was real and what was part of the test.  They reacted as though under attack.  Moorestown informed NORAD at Colorado Springs that a missile had just been launched from Cuba.  They calculated that it was targeted on Tampa, Florida [just up the road from Sarasota] and would detonate at 9:02 AM.  The Strategic Air Command in Omaha was alerted that a nuclear attack was under way, as was the command room at the Pentagon.  But there was no nuclear detonation in Tampa.  ...

This scare sounds impossible.  Who could have anticipated that during a test a satellite would come up on a radar screen at the precise moment and exact location where a missile launched from Cuba would have appeared?  No fail-safe system could anticipate such a coincidence -- and on the tensest day of the entire Cold War.  But it happened.

Apocalyptic fear of nuclear disaster gripped East Europeans and the Soviet peoples far less dramatically.  All they heard was reassuring government propaganda, even if few believed it.  The Cuban missile crisis scared millions in the West who followed the news of it day by day.  Many key events were carried live on television.  But in the Soviet Union not a hint of the crisis was revealed until it was nearly over, and then only on an inside page of Pravda.  It was only the party elite who had any idea of what really was going on. ...

[Deep background]:  Eisenhower [years before the Cuban crisis] approved a system by which, if the conventional command and control system were destroyed, local commanders would have authority to launch nuclear weapons if, in their view, the country was under nuclear attack.  In the Cuban missile crisis, accordingly, one fighter squadron of the Twenty-eighth Air Division in California, armed with nuclear weapons, flew with all safety devices removed.  The division's official history noted, ""Only the pilot stood between the complete weapon system and a full-scale nuclear detonation.""  Fortunately, the top guns desisted from starting a nuclear war.

In addition to this, the head of Strategic Air Command had specific ""authority to order retaliatory attack ... if time or circumstances would not permit a decision by the president.""  At the head of SAC had been the bullish Curtis LeMay.  [LeMay was derided by the liberal Left as a warmonger, and was probably the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove.]  In 1957 he was replaced by the even more bullish General Thomas Power.  LeMay later admitted that he was concerned about Power.  ""He was mean;  he was cruel, unforgiving, and he didn't have the time of day to pass with anyone.""  LeMay used to ""worry that General Power [who testified that we would be winners of any war if there were more of us alive than ""the bastards"" on the other side] was not stable.""

========================================================

[This material is from Cold War: An Illustrated History, 1945 - 1991.  It was a companion volume to the CNN Cold War series, and was written by Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing, both British, hence ""defence"" instead of ""defense.""

Can't find it now, but the book includes an obligatory reference to JFK's speech at Washington University in 1963, after the missile crisis, in which he used the crisis as a pretext for advocating talks to control nuclear weapons & to reduce the threat of war.  That speech is often cited in just that way, and is an implied happy ending to the world's moment of maximum danger in 1962.  We went to the brink, somehow survived, and were impelled by survival and a visionary president to move into the sunlight of sanity.

But a few paragraphs earlier, Isaacs & Downing correctly noted that the take-home message taken home after the Cuban crisis by the Soviets is that they needed more bombs.  In 1963, and for the next 25 years, the Soviets were almost invariably willing to talk about limiting weapons while they were building weapons at an unprecedented pace.

We in America became enamored of talk & treaties.  We confused words on paper with accomplishment.  In the early 1970s President Nixon talked up a treaty in which the US and the USSR agreed to stop producing biological weapons, weaponized smallpox and anthrax and ebola.

The bio-warfare treaty sort of worked.  The United States stopped all research on the development & production of bio-weapons.  The USSR didn't.  Even as the Soviet economy was collapsing in 1990 and 1991, millions of rubles were still being diverted to secret bio-weapon programs.",1139875200,4,10248,4.93859649122807
168485,5,0800141709,"This is a classic spoof filmed during the height of the Cold War, and Stanley Kubrick's only comedy film starring Peter Sellers, playing three roles: RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, U.S. President Merkin Muffley and the title role of Dr. Strangelove.

The plot is about a crazed USAF base commander, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) of Burpelson Air Force Base, who orders his 34 fully-armed B-52 bombers to attack their targets inside Russia, all due to his hatred of communism and ""the international communist plot to sap and impurify all of our precious, bodily fluids."" The order to attack the Soviet Union stemmed over the the use of flouridation added to our water supply. ""We need fresh, pure water,"" he says, ""A foreign substance added without the knowledge of the individual. That's the way your hardcore Commie works!""

Though Ripper was a fictional character, he was right! Disgusting impurities, such as flouride and chlorine, have been in our water supply for many years, and ordinary tap water has been genetically altered as well as the American food supply with artificial additives and preservatives.

Continuing with this film, Sellers was initially offered a fourth role as B-52 pilot, Major ""King"" Kong, but since he was unable to master a western-style drawl, that role ultimately went to the California-bred Slim Pickens, whose drawl was natural, and yet, unusual for any Californian. Who cannot forget George C. Scott with his comical side, playing General Buck Turgidson, scuffling with the Soviet ambassador played by British actor, Peter Bull. ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""

Upstart actors, such as a young James Earl Jones, plays the role of bombardier, Lieutenant Luthar Zogg, who had difficulty in opening the bomb bay doors after their plane had been damaged in the aftermath of being hit by a surface-to-air missile, resulting in Major Kong going into the weapons bay during the bomb run to repair the damage in order to open the bomb doors, and dropping with the bomb on his way to oblivion shouting and waving his hat, ""YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAH!""

This is a great film for any Kubrick or Sellers fan as well as Air Force veterans during the Cold War like myself. The beginning of the film, opening with a KC-135 fuelling up a B-52 was from an actual Air Force footage to compliment this film. If you noticed in the first shot of Burpelson Air Force Base, which is supposed to be somewhere in the United States, it is basically a sketched drawing and in the immediate scenes thereafter, Air Force footage of a huge, rotating radar dish and a B-52 taking off.

168487,5,0800141709,"I never imagined that anyone could successfully satirize a subject as scary and gruesome such as nuclear war and destruction.  While it isn't as prevalent as it was during the Cold War, the threat still exists, and it is a scary one.  And yet, Stanley Kubric's Dr. Strangelove is a perfectly good example of a satirical look at such a subject.

Filmed in black and white, the movie chronicles a few hours in the worst day in human history.  A high-ranking United States general, General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden), has recently gone insane with rage, paranoia, and fear of the Soviets.  He has decided to execute an order reserved for sneak attacks; basically, in the event of a surprise attack on Washington, D.C., it allows someone besides the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.  He quarantines the entire base, making everyone believe that they are under attack, and the only person who sees through the madness is his executive officer, British officer Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers).

Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) has called a conference of top US generals, including Gen. Bucky Turgidson (George C. Scott), Russian ambassador Sadesky (Peter Bull), and German nuclear expert Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again).  While at the conference in an underground War Room, the president learns about the improbability of being able to call back the fighters, as well as the existence of a Russian doomsday device that cannot be shut down.

While the president desperately attempts to call back the planes on their way to Russia, circumstances in the air make things even more complicated, one of which being that the pilot of one of the planes, Major T.J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) is extremely gung-ho about the mission.

Many different aspects of the film are wonderfully used to satirize the situation.  From character names such as Kissov, ""Bat"" Guano, ""King"" Kong, Turgidson, and Strangelove, to the hilarious dialogue that has become some of the most famous lines that everyone knows, but doesn't know the origin.  Some of the famous lines include, ""You can't fight in here!  This is the war room!"".  Even some of the situations are priceless, such as the one involving Mandrake and the Coke machine.

It truly is amazing how brilliant this movie is.  Never before have I laughed so hard at a subject that sends chills down my spine.  The whole film was very well executed, and is definitely worth a viewing.",1131753600,7,2453,5.002463054187192

168500,2,0800141709,"For English this year our fabulous teacher, Mr. Black decided to bless us by giving us the privilage of watching ""Dr. Strangelove"" in class. In my opinion the movie is interesting but not that funny. It keeps you wondering what is going to happen next but did not seem to bring out many chuckles from me. In order to laugh though, you would need to have some backround information on the story and know some history to really get thi jist of what was going on. I would often find Mr. Black stopping the movie to explain what was goin on, this made it make more sense to me but if he wasn't there to explain to me I don't think I would have gotten what was going on.

If I were a sixteen year old ( which I am) I would not go out of my way on the weekend to rent or buy Dr,Strangelove. But considering the circumstances of being in english in the middle of the school day the movie was quite a blessing being alot more interesting and funny than any documentary or boring, library barrowed, video on the digestive system.

One thing this movie is good at showing is satire. Satire is something making a point but being humorous at the same time. A good example of this is at the end of the movie the ""John Wayne"" type hero goes down to the bomb doors becuase they will not open. He then fixes the problem and is sitting on the bomb with the doors wide open. The nuclear bomb falls and he is left riding it down to the nuclear silo of the "" Ruskies"". This is satirizing an everday ""Hic"" or ""Redneck"" American, a man screaming at the top of his lungs ""YEEE HAAHH"" with a big gun and no the greatest feelings towards american enemys.",1129680000,5,1629,4.201277955271565
168501,4,0800141709,"For my high school English class we watched ""Dr. Strangelove."" Though I often needed the teacher's help to catch some ""funny parts"" I personally, found the movie very interesting. The ""funny parts"" aren't exactly what I would call hilarious. The irony in this film isn't ""ha ha"" funny.  To enjoy this movie you must understand irony and satires. One thing I enjoyed most about the movie is the satires, the hidden, dry comedy.

For example, the ""Peace Is Our Profession"" sign is ironic because in front of the sing there are men killing each other. The irony is so strong to a point where few understand it. The irony proves so much about our world today. The men in the army are trained to fight and become enemies in order to make peace.

There are a few quotes that I remember the most. For example, when General Buck Turgidson says ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks."" This is ironic because if the bomb hits Russia the whole world is going to end. No one will be alive.

Another quote I remember the most was said by President Merkin Muffley. ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room,"" is very ironic. The War Room is used to plan out strategies for War. Telling them they can't fight is ironic because here they are planning on killing other people.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Like every movie, not everyone will like it. For some it will be hard to understand at first. Some parts are needed to be explained to understand the ""funny part."" This is definitely a movie I would watch any chance I got.",1129680000,2,1666,4.485148514851486
168502,4,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, made in 1964, is a comedic war movie set in the Cold War days. The whole movie starts when Colonel Jack D. Ripper goes absolutely insane. Colonel Ripper orders his U.S. Air Force bomber wing to bomb and destroy the U.S.S.R. After this order is given, the President of the United States and his advisors come together. This is where the Soviet ambassador informs him that if even one bomb is dropped it will set off a doomsday machine. The doomsday machine would basically destroy all life on Earth. Many try to help prevent this tragedy, but in the end one last plane does not receive the code ""OPE"" to call off the raid. Overall, I thought this movie had a very dry sense of humor. Although, there were some very comedic parts, the movie was not entirely funny. I, myself did enjoy this movie, however I would not recommend it to people in my age group, but rather to people in their 40's and older who I personally think might appreciate the satire of this movie a bit more.",1129680000,2,993,4.461538461538462
168503,4,0800141709,"This movie takes places in the 50's Cold War Era, when the threat of nuclear war between the United States and the U.S.S.R is at a high risk. The title is of a German Dr. working for the United States government, who doesn't have control of his right arm. You don't see him until midway through the movie. It starts out when General Ripper of Burpleson Air force Base sends out a message for the B-52 bombers to bomb the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. The thing is General Ripper did this without authorization from any higher authority. General Ripper is psychotic, which you can tell throughout the movie by some of the things he says. Through the plan the bombers are given a code only he knows so. The General kills himself midway through the movie along with the knowledge of what the code is. Captain Mandrake, General Ripper's executive officer, figures out the code and relays it to the War Room and they recall the bombers, but one does not turn around. This is Major Kong's plane, which was hit by a missile and its radio is disabled. The plane then flies to a missile complex and drop the bomb with Major Kong riding on top of it into battle. This sets off a Dooms Day Machine, which will destroy the world.

This movie has a lot of satire in it. One of the most memorable ones is when the President says, ""Gentlemen, You can't fight in here this is a war room."" Another one is when the army is trying to infiltrate the Burpleson Air Force Base they are shooting under a sign that says ""Peace is our Profession."" Major Kong is represented as the basic American hero. He overcame many obstacles to complete his mission, but what is ironic is that if he completes his mission everyone dies.

I would recommend this movie it was entertaining and had a lot of meaning in the script. The writers satirized something while putting some humor in it as well. I think if u lived during that time u might understand",1129680000,2,1920,4.451704545454546
168504,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, a movie satirizing the ups and downs of the cold war made years ago, but funny now?  Considering you see the everlasting image of Kong riding a nuclear missile which demonstrates the ideal American man with the ""big"" missile, I'd say you're in for a treat if you've managed to never see this movie.  Dr. Strangelove satirizes everything from the coldwar itself, to enemies and the immaturity of government officials, to mocking the slogan of our U.S. Air Force.  I liked this movie for its daring attempts to satirize something that has left a mark in our history.

The movie is about a certain Burpleson Air Force Base, and its General, Jack D. Ripper (Jack the ripper, get it?).  He is giving orders to his assistant I believe, to go ahead and put in a code to all planes instructing them to attack Russia.  Everybody certainly agrees that it is a mistake or a drill, until they check the code and face the truth, they really have been instructed to attack.  The problem is, Russia has built a huge bomb underneath of the country that will explode when a nuclear missile implodes on it.  I know you're thinking, yea it's in there country it's okay. WRONG! VERY WRONG! This bomb is so strong that it has enough power to cause a gigantic nuclear explosion that would wipe out all of mankind. Every single person in every single country would be wiped out. And yes, this includes Bin Laden, no matter what four foot hole In Irag that he's hiding in!  By now, you'll realize that General Ripper is crazy, ""A little funny, in the head"" according to President Muffley.  You'll see evidence supporting this through his actions of cutting all communications to the base.  Then, in comes the Russian Ambassador who, as far as any person with an I.Q. over ten can see, is spying and taking advantage of the situation.  But anyways, after this is a bunch of crap, Kong's memorable John Wayne re-enactment, and so more crap.  In the end, the ambassador sets off the bomb and the world is pretty much over.

Might I quickly add that Dr. Strangelove, although seen only a few times, is the man!! Anybody who fights there own arm is certainly a hero in my book!",1129593600,2,2165,4.575129533678757
168505,3,0800141709,"Some people consider Dr. Strangelove one of the funniest movies of all time. Personally, I thought that the movie was decent, considering that it was made in 1964.  The movie is basically about nuclear war and the effects that it would have if it ever happened. The main character(Colonel Jack Ripper) goes completely INSANE and sends bombs to destroy Russia. By doing this, it will start a Doomsday Machine, which will destroy every single thing in the world.

The whole movie was just one big, giant satire.  What the director wanted to do is show people just how stupid nuclear warfare is, and he did show a good example for that. But, some of the satires weren't good enough.  I must admit, that there were a lot of funny ones, but most of them were just plain stupid.

If you are young and don't comprehend things very well then I suggest you DO NOT buy this movie. But, for all you smart older people, go ahead and buy it, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.",1129593600,,961,4.468571428571429
168506,4,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove? ?  What could that possibly be about?  Yeah that's what I was thinking when I heard we were watching a movie in English class called Dr. Strangelove.  Little did I know it was going to be the best movie that I had to watch in school so far.  Usually all the movies we watch are educational boring movies that you have to fight to stay awake during.  However, this black and white movie was just a jam packed satire.  In the beginning, Ripper sent out planes with nuclear bombs heading to Russia to stop the communists.  They are under a secret plan,  Plan R , which makes it impossible for anyone except Ripper to contact them.  So the president has a meeting in the War Room which by the way isn't allowed to have any kind of violence in.  They all talk everything over trying to come up with a plan to stop these planes.  The president knew that if the planes hit Russia it would be suicide because they would bomb us right back.  Later on in the movie we find out that Russia has a Dooms Day device and if you blow up Russia POOF the whole world goes with it.  So this really made everyone nervous and they knew they were in trouble if they couldn't find a way to stop these planes.

So they do many different things to try and contact the planes or stop them from hitting and meanwhile so much chaos is going on.  The movie basically targets men at the time since there's only one woman in the whole movie and she's just a playboy bunny.  Then men are the biggest satire because it's like  Oh well my nuclear bomb is bigger then yours  So Strangelove comes up with a bright idea, while fighting off his right hand, saying that if the bomb hits then they can go into a coal mine and live down there.  Of course there would have to be 10 women per man just so they can get the population back to normal.

I'm not going to spoil the ending or tell you too much about it so you can see for yourself.  I highly recommend this movie unless you are a group of 15 year old girls wanting to see a good movie with hot guys.  This is a movie filled with satire and something that makes you think a little and have a few laughs.",1129593600,3,2137,4.148418491484185
168507,4,0800141709,"For about a week, my English class has viewed Dr. Strangelove (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.) Most people have heard of Dr. Strangelove- It's considered a classic. But is it really a classic, or overrated?

The plot is centered around the U.S. in the Cold War, at Burpleson air force base (where General Ripper and Captain Mandrake [played by Peter Sellers] are), the War Room (where the president [played by Peter Sellers], General Turgidson, and Dr. Strangelove [ALSO played by Peter Sellers] himself are), and Major Kong and his crew on the plane with a bomb. General Ripper at the Base, who is INSANE, sends the plane to bomb 'the Commies' ..and only he knows the Code to stop it. The Code is a three letter combination.. but it would take too long to guess. The code is later figured out by Captain Mandrake, but some more trouble is headed their way.. the plane is damaged and can't get incoming messages... including the Code. Major Kong and his crew spend most of the movie playing the 'Hero' and trying to take out orders and bomb the Commies..although we know it is very much the opposite. Dr. Strangelove informs the president and his 'people' in the War Room that because of a ""Doomsday Device"", if one bomb goes of, it will be the end of the world. The movie is a huge satire with them dealing with this dilemma. It's funny but it makes you realize how stupid the characters are.

One scene that stands out is where the president says: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room."" I knew about this line before even seeing the movie. It's pretty well known. Another scene you may know is at Burpleson Air force base, the soldiers are shooting at each other right under the sign for the base that says ""Peace is our profession.""

If you're wondering whether or not to see this movie, I'd say rent it first. The writing is Genius - it's cleverly worded and witty. But not everyone will get the humor. It isn't flat out. You have to think about it and look at detail to see the humor, because it's subtle. If you're into really slap-stick comedy, this isn't what you're looking for. I'd say Dr. Strangelove would appeal to an older audience.",1129593600,,2189,4.508816120906801

I understood some jokes that some others may not get but that doesn't mean they were all funny to me. There were funny parts, there were dull slow parts. A lot of jokes had to be explained which for the most part killed the humor. I watched this in English class so as far as school movies go this was one of the best. You need a certain kind of satirical humor which I think I understand pretty well for some one my age. So I would say not great, not bad, pretty good.",1129593600,,638,4.031496062992126

The General tries to contact them and doesn't get through...of course.  During class i thought the movie was kind of funny but the teacher had to explain some of the satire in the movie because it was a little outragous.  It is also funny how the colonel goes crazy about the floritization of water and how he lost his manly fluids because of it and this koo koo guy starts this whole thing over his manly uses and makes American's fight American's because of it.  You should deffinatly get the movie if you love satires.,1129593600,,857,4.3584905660377355
168510,4,0800141709,"The movie Dr. Strangelove is a black and white film making fun of what would happen if the world was condemned to destruction by a ""Dooms Day Device"" made by the Russians and detonated to go off if their country was bombed. Unfortunately for the world, a crazy Military General commanded bombers to attack Russia since he felt they were going to attack anyways. He also gives the bomber pilots a code to let them know when they should listen to the radio for commands. Fortunately, someone finds out the code, sends it out to the pilots, and the world is saved, except that one plane was hit which messed up any way they could see what code is sent out, so they end up being the ""heroes"" of the story and get the job done.

I had to watch this for my English class and I did have the teacher's help explaining what parts were supposed to be funny and why exactly they were so humorous. It is loaded with satire, which you might not catch until the second time you watch it. This movie was somewhat eccentric in parts, like Dr. Strangelove's hand trying to choke him, and yet it is still funny even though the oddness of each character is surprising since these are supposed to represent the leaders of our country. I did find some parts of the movie very funny these parts were mostly when the leaders of the country were in the war room discussing what must be done to save the world. Also, the part with the bomber pilot steering down the explosive with his cowboy hat and Woohooing all the way down was definitely a ""tear jerker"". This film was not exactly one of the best or funniest I have seen and I would certainly recommend renting the movie before buying it, but I would defiantly watch this a second and third time.",1129593600,,1725,4.373831775700935

The movie uses a lot of satire and its kind of hard to see unless you are told what to look for. I don't think this is  a ""Oh my god! That was the funniest thing I've ever seen"" kind of movie. Its more of a ""Oh.. that was kinda funny..."" sort of movie. In the movie, a billboard on base reads, ""Peace is our Profession."" See, I don't find this hysterically funny but my English teacher keeps reassuring us that it is. I understand the irony of the whole thing, but its not funniest thing i've ever seen. I just don't see why it is in the top 10 funniest movies.

In order to understand this movie it would also be helpful to have lived during the cold war. There is probably a lot of jokes in the movie that you would only get if you knew more about the cold war. I would not recomend this movie to younger viewers for that reason. But other than that it was a good movie. I don't think that I would choose to watch this movie on my own free time but it was nice to watch in class.

Well guess what, Mr. President didn't order the general to do that. Ripper blocks off all comunications with the outside and sets his hole base against anyone who comes within 200 yards of the base. The movie goes on with the president discussing things with other officials in the war room. In the end the plans get called back except one and they set off their boom. Once it explodes the doomsday device is set off and it is the end of the world. This movie is set back after the cold war. So for me that was way long ago. It was hard to relize some of the satire in it. This move is funny, but is a differnt funny as compared to your cartoons or comic book. This is full of satire.

168514,5,0800141709,"All throughout last week, my english class viewed ""Dr. Strangelove"".  A satire, the movie mocks the idea of war for peace. It begins at the height of the Cold War.  A general of the armed forces decides that the idea of communism must be stopped.  He orders nuclear bombers into the air, and in doing so, a nuclear attack has begun without the president's consent. A new protocol has been enlisted and in time of nuclear war, a base commander is permitted to launch a nuclear attack in the event that the chain of command is disrupted because of nuclear attack.  The new protocol is now the cause of the end of the world.

 Now, a heated debate begins on what should be done.  Someone suggests that if they struck the Russians hard enough, they could win a nuclear war with ""acceptable loss"", of fifteen to twenty million. This is where the movies humor begins to become apparent. The general, who engaged the nuclear war, believes the communists are attempting to poison American soldiers with fluoride water. As the movie progresses we see how insane the general is, yet his insanity and far-fetched thoughts add to the humor of the movie. He is the only man who obtains the ""code"" that could call off the nuclear attacks entirely; however, before it was too late, the general takes his own life in fear of being a prisoner of war. As American bombers begin to reach their targets, one plane is  hit badly and the plane is severely damaged.  As the president and his cabinet work furiously to work on deciphering the code, the American bombers work to repair the plane damage and re-route to a new target.  The code is then deciphered and the attack is called off and slowly the American bombers begin to retreat, however as for the plane that was hit, the radio transmissions with the code are not received due to the damage, so they continue toward their target.  Heroic? Well, not exactly, you see the communists have planted a ""doomsday"" device in with will detonate upon any explosion.  When the plane drops its bomb, the device is engaged and the world ends.

This movie makes fun of the U.S. military during the 1960's and the way the whole country thought about Russia or as they and I like to call them the ""Ruskies"". The whole pretty much goes with some crazy general ordering his troops to go drop nuclear bombs on Russia and is the only one who knows the recall code. The whole movie the president and his staff are trying to recall the planes to stop the nuclear attack since Russia has built a ""doomsday device"" where if anyone drops a bomb on Russia the whole world will be destroyed. It turns out you don't even find out who Dr. Strangelove is until at least half-way through the movie. The movie not all that bad but i found that many parts were confusing or misleading in some way. But some parts make sense like the famous quote, ""Gentlemen, there is no fighting in here, this is the war room!"" Which was voted as one of the funniest lines in movie history. As it turns out they do finally discover the code but face one huge problem along the way and if you really want to find out you might want to buy this movie.

168520,4,0800141709,"Upon a nuclear attack on the Soviets ordered by the mad general (Sterling Hayden), the President (Peter Sellers) and the generals (most notably George C. Scott) had an important meeting at the Pentagon to resolve the crisis.

George C. Scott was the man to see in the film. He had great speeches to make and his convictions were unfaltered right to the end. Peter Sellers (as the President, the aide captain to the mad general as well as the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove) was everywhere in the film. I never saw Peter Sellers in such a serious role as the President.  The most impressive shot is the one when the military man riding on the bomb down to USSR.

Many parts of the film was documentary like, deliberatley so. But I can't help noticing that(1) 18 minutes before the bomb was to be on USSR soil, the Presidents of the 2 countries were still exchanging pleasantries on the phone. (2) the man on the falling bomb was holding in a position most convenient for the camera but defying gravity nevertheless. (3) the captain (Peter Sellers) could manage to phone the President from a military base. All these begged disbelief and contributed the comical/cynical elements to the film, they were more symbolic than anything else.

A film with sarcastic, dark moments and an ending to be pondered.",1123977600,2,1303,4.752212389380531
168521,5,0800141709,"""Dr. Strangelove"" is Stanley Kubrick's wonderful black comedy look at the nuclear arms race between the UNited States and Russia in the 1960s.  The film is loosely based off of a much more serious novel, entitled ""Red Alert"" and the film was actually intended to be of a serious nature; when Kubrick apparently had a sudden change of heart---thank God!!

THis film is fabulous!

The film starts with General Ripper ordering his guard bombers to prepare for an attack against Soviet targets in a retaliation strike.  Problem is, there was no Soviet attack for which they would be retaliating to.  Ripper didn't care, because he was so wound up in all of the communist propaganda, that he felt he needed to take matters into his own hands.  His character is one of the funniest characters I have seen in a movie, due to his completly insane ramblings.  My favorite of his rants is when he goes on about how the flouridation of water is a communist idea that has infiltrated the United States.  He looks squarley and very seriously to his executive office ""Mandrake""(one of 3 characters played by Peter Sellers)eyes and tell him that they are flouridating such items as salt, soup, soda, etc....""even ice cream.  Yes, little children's ice cream.""  I rarely laugh out loud when watching a film alone, but just couldn't help myself during this scene.  The way in which he looks at Sellers and the expression Sellers gives is just priceless.

Speaking of Sellers, he plays 3 roles in the film and certainly mastered all of them.  My favorite is his role as the president.  This is probably the most serious character in the film.  He is the only character who seems to have any kind of a grip on what the repercussions of the un-authorized retaliation attack will have on both the United States and the world; and, is the only character who is dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to stop the attack.  But, the conversations he engages in are really funny.  The best of which are his dialogues on the telephone with the Russian ambassador.  The first time they speak on the phone the ambassador is drunk and apparently scolds the president for not calling simply to say ""hello"".  Then, in a later conversation, we hear him try to explain to the Russian ambassador that he is just as sorry as the ambassador is that the attacks may be too far along to stop.
Sellers' final character is the title role of Dr. Strangelove, a German arms scientist, hired by the United States as a consultant of sorts.  He is a truly evil and sinister man, who is confined to a wheelchair.  Strangelove confirms to the members of the war room that the United States has secretly created a device known as the ""Doomsday Device"" that will destroy the world and activate on it's own at the slightest hint of a nuclear war breakout.  Hence the reason the the president is so sorry that the retaliation attack cannot be stopped.  Strangelove does concoct a plan at the end, which is really where I understood how intelligent this film was.  I will leave that ""building of a society"" plan for you viewers to watch and interpret on your own; but it really is creepy to think that in a time of war or apocalypse, people of this mindset may actually be influential.

George C. Scott plays the ""over the top"" role of General Turdison.  HIs character is very child-like and VERY paranoid about the communist reign.  He provides comedy in every scene he is a part of and really exchanges well on screen with Peter Sellers.  His character is also the most familiar with the ""destination"" of the retaliation attack.

The only other notable characters in the film are ""Kong"", played by Slim Pickens.  He is the pilot of the bomber plane headed to destroy a missle site in Russian.  We also see a very young James Earl Jones as a bombedier in the same plane.

Folks, this movie is wonderfully funny and amazingly relevant even in this era of filmmaking.  The themes still hold true to our society today and the comedy and dialogue in this film are absolutly masterful.

On a quick side note, I found it very interesting that one of the themes of the film is a trouble with basic communication.  Right from the very beginning when Ripper is asking his officer if he recognizes his voice all the way to the near end, when Office Mandrake is having trouble gettnig thru on the pay phone to the president, our characters have to deal with some sort of problem with communication.  General Ripper phones Turdison in the beginning and has to relay his message thru Turdison's secretary, because Turdison is on the toilet.  The president has difficuly understand the Russian ambassador in their first conversation, first because the signal is faded and the background music is loud; and, then because the ambassador is drunk.  And, throughout the whole film, the most obvious is the fact that nobody can reach any of the bomber planes that are on teir way to Russia, because part of the attack's plans called for all communication ties to be cut, in fear of international signal crossing.  There are many more examples---just something for the hardcore fans to look for next time.

Hey folks, this is worth much more than a rent--just buy it...you're probably going to end up doing so anyway!",1123804800,,5247,4.679389312977099
168522,5,0800141709,"This review is for the 40th Anniversary Special Edition released by Columbia/Tristar in 2004.

The movie ""Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a cold-war black comedy that satirizes the nuclear arms race between superpower governments.  The  basic story line takes place in the early 1960's where a psychologically unstable U.S. Air Force Brigadier General named Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders a surprise nuclear attack on Russia from a NATO base in England.  The attack is to be made by deploying a series of squadrons of B-52 bombers which are ordered to drop nuclear missiles on strategic locals within Russia.  When Washington finds out about this unprovoked attack, an emergency meeting is held in the Pentagon's War Room where restrained hysteria and pandemonium begin.

British actor Peter Sellers plays three characters in this movie: Royal Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake, U. S. President Merkin Muffley and German physicist Dr. Strangelove.  The Mandrake and Muffley roles are strictly deadpan comedy, while the Strangelove character uses a lot of physical comedy and overtly humorous rants regarding nuclear annihilation.  I found Sellers especially impressive in the role as the U.S. president, due to his authentic-sounding American accent.

Arguably the strongest performance in the movie belongs to George C. Scott in his portrayal as U.S. General 'Buck' Turgidson.  His animated body movement and overly emotional facial expressions steal the show.  Another notable performance is by the tobacco-chewing cowboy actor Slim Pickens who plays B-52 pilot Major T.J. 'King' Kong.  Pickens' exiting scene in the movie is visually one of the greatest in the history of filmmaking.  The humor in this movie is constant but subtle.  My only critical comment about the movie is that I feel the final scene in the war room was extraneous and too over the top.  But still, this is a superb film.

As for the DVD, since this was a ""special edition"" package, one would expect a fully restored version, but this wasn't the case.  There isn't much film deterioration, but you'll see an occasional spec of film wear here and there.  All in all, its a very sharp black and white transfer.  The sound is very satisfactory.

There are plenty of special features contained in this package including brief cold war documentaries by Roger Ebert, Bob Woodward, Robert McNamara and Spike Lee.  Most of the observations were overstating the obvious, but it was interesting to observe as best as I can recall that no one admitted that the arms race is what ultimately defeated communism in Russia in the 1980's.  I did feel that Spike Lee's comments were particularly inane however.  Another documentary included a more in depth examination of the cold war era by former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  There was also a too-brief feature of the career of Peter Sellers.  Another bonus feature which was by far the best, was the making of the film Dr. Strangelove.  In this we learn many things including the fact that Peter Sellers was originally cast as the B-52 pilot but was later replaced by Slim Pickens.  In addition we learn that the final scene in the movie was a pie fight, but was left on the editing room floor.  We also learn that a special screening was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day that JFK was assassinated, so the film was postponed and edited slightly to remove a comment by Pickens where he mentions, ""....a guy could have a good time in Dallas...."".  The word ""Dallas"" was changed to ""Las Vegas"".  There is also a nice biographical feature on director Stanley Kubrick.  My overall assessment of the package is that it was significantly overpriced for quality of material, and again, not to have a fully restored movie for $28 is a travesty in my opinion.

Based on ""Red Alert"" by Peter Bryant (AKA Peter George), Dr. S. is a movie about a USAF General who goes ""a little funny in the head"" and sends all the B-52s in his bomb wing to attack the USSR.  A frantic president and Soviet premier (who we never see or hear, but the president is talking to him on the phone) try to avert the attack.  The result is a comedy with a bang of laughter.  More or less just like ""Fail Safe"" in that the president and the premier must work together to stop the attack from triggering nuclear war, only in Dr. Strangelove it makes for an absolutely hilarious plot, something Fail Safe doesn't even attempt to do.

168527,5,0800141709,"...It is not very noticeable, but near the end of the film as Dr. Stanglove battles with his unruly arm while trying to suggest a possible remedy to the apocalyptic plight of the world, it can be seen that ""Mr. Ambassador"" starts cracking up in the background.  This occurs about the time when the arm starts propelling Strangelove's wheelchair in aimless directions.  There are many knee slapping moments aside from this one, in which Peter Seller's and the rest of the cast really shine.
  I do take issue with some of the other reviewers comments about the darkness of the humor.  To a large extent, I found  the humor was mostly situational, not unlike the legendary TV series Seinfield.  One moment in particular in which this is illustrated is when British officer Mandrake, having information that may well avoid a nuclear holocaust, has to argue with a dimwitted soldier over the shooting of a lock off a pop machine for the necessary change to call the President of the United States.  After losing patents, and berating the office with insults, the officer tells Mandrake, ""OK, I'll shoot the lock off, but so help me, if you don't get the president of the united states on the line, your going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.""  As if in the throws of nuclear a potential nuclear war such a reality is of any importance.
  Admittedly the movie is about nuclear winter and therefore inherently dark, but I would argue that the topic is explored in the most pleasant way possible.",1122422400,,1500,4.708812260536399
168528,5,0800141709,"`Dr. Strangelove', directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by Kubrick, Terry Southern, and Peter George, the author of the novel on which the story is based is one of those certifiably classic movies which is probably better remembered than the film which happened to win the Academy Award for best picture for 1964. This is truly amazing, as the situation on which it is based, the nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union is fast becoming a fond memory (in comparison with the difficulties in dealing with terrorism today).

Unquestionably the best aspect of this movies for DVD purchasers is how eminently rewatchable it is. I saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and I have seen it on broadcast TV, on VCR tape, and now on DVD at least seven or eight times over the last forty years, and I still find it entertaining and I still find little things here and there which I did not remember seeing before.

At the time the film was released, there was a great controversy over who in the United States was the model for the character of Dr. Strangelove. The betting seemed to be allocated 50% to Edward Teller, 30% to Henry Kissinger, and 20% to Werner von Braun. Based on a recent profile in `The New Yorker' on Hermann Kahn, the proper allocation should be about 90% Kahn with only about 10% to von Braun to account for the theme of suppressed loyalty to Nazi Germany. Not only did Kubrick mold the plot around Kahn's theories in his book `On Thermonuclear War', Kubrick insisted that several members of his production staff read the book. Kubrick actually consulted with Kahn on several points and Kahn was not at all unhappy with how Kubrick played out the theory of mutual deterrence that lies at the heart of the plot. Even some of the story elements which seemed totally off the wall such as the `mine shaft gap' were real concerns of Herman Kahn.

In case you are totally new to this picture, it is an extremely dark comedy about the events leading up to an unplanned, but certainly not accidental thermonuclear holocaust. Part of the quality of this movie is signaled by the fact that a contemporary serious movie with a similar premise, `Fail Safe', is largely forgotten today.

Peter Sellers in three different roles head up the cast. Amazingly, all of his three roles are largely `straight men'. Most of the real humor is played out by his other leads and supporting actors such as George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickins, and Keenan Wynn.

I suspect part of the reason this movie got mixed reviews when it was originally released is the fact that there are a number of lines and scenes put into the movie for cheap laughs. The most famous, recently enshrined high in the list of most quotable movie lines is the statement `You can't fight in here, this is the War Room'. At least two or three other scenes are done purely for quick comic relief. The truly most indelible image is one of the final scenes when B-52 piloted by Slim Pickens finally drops one bomb that sets of the climax of the movie.

The most effective contribution of the director and the writers is how the classic tension on whether the thermonuclear disaster will be averted, as events sway the probability of the outcome back and forth from doom to survival.

This `Special Edition' does not have the one feature that literally doubles the value of the DVD. It has no director/writer/actor commentary, which is totally unsurprising as the director and all the principle actors are no longer with us. But, more is always better, so if the discount on the special edition is good, take it!

This is one of those movies like `Ghostbusters' and Animal House' and most of Stanley Kubrick's other movies that I watch at least once every other year. Highly recommended.",1121299200,,3796,4.663677130044843

168531,3,0800141709,"I am sorry, but unlike a great deal of the reviewers, I do not believe this is the greatest comedy every made and certainly not the best film ever made.  Not even close.  I'll admit, the film was amusing at times, but I think it's overrated at best.  I like satires, but this just didn't catch my interest.  Sometimes I had no idea what was going on during this film.  I kept looking at the clock on the wall, desperately hoping it would end.  I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  When I saw it at the video rental store, I was really excited, because I kept meaning to watch it and I thought I was going to love it.  But I really didn't.  I wouldn't watch it again.  However, if it was just rated on acting, I would give it five stars because the actors were phenomenal in their parts.  Peter Sellers did a superb job.

This movie is just not what I thought it would be.  It just struck me as bizarre, confusing, and only slightly funny.  I enjoyed the scenes of the hotline and the fluoridation discussion.

To the reviewer who compared this film to ""Gone with the Wind"" I can only say that you're insane.  ""Gone With the Wind"" is a touching, if not a bit biased, portrayal of life in the old south, filled with wonderful music, beautiful scenery, outstanding acting, and a heart-wrenching plot.  ""Dr. Strangelove"" was amusing at times, but never even came CLOSE to ""Gone With the Wind"".  There is a reason that ""Gone With the Wind"" is #4 on the AFI's Greatest Movies of All-Time while ""Dr. Strangelove"" is #26.  I personally don't believe it deserves even that ranking.

This movie wasn't bad, but I didn't really think it was good either.  Honestly, I wouldn't watch it again.  It just wasn't worth the 93 minutes of my life.  Basically, this is somewhat of a cult-classic.  Some people will love it, some won't.  It takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.  My father enjoyed it tremendously.  Just don't think it's a rip-roaring comedy when it really is not.  It's an eccentric kind of humor that not all will enjoy.  Fluoridation or not.",1117756800,6,2047,4.42741935483871
168532,5,0800141709,"Forget ""Gone with The Wind"". This is the greatest movie ever made. And this special edition comes close to encapsulating it. There are, as usual, some gripes to be had. But the overall package is impressive.

In 1963, the world had just lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, and nuclear one-upsmanship was a pressinc concern. The overwhelmind seriousness of atomic war was almost too much to take on a serious level. So leave it to Stanley Kubrick and Terry Southern to approach the subject in an unusual way: the End of The World as Comedy. The most surprising thing is, it worked.

The film runs roughshod over the prevailing notions of US-Russia relations during the Cold War, and the nuclear preparedness of both countries in the event one should strike. Its plot is probably well-known to even the new viewers at this point, so I'll just disect the DVD package here.

The film is presented in letterboxing or widescreen format, a move which seems to restore the movie to its original aspect ratio. There are probably some details lost in the frame because of this, but the widescreen is not so obvious that it distracts the viewer.

The supplementary features include those already on a previous ""special editon"", but also have brand-new documentaries on the performances of Peter Sellers and the actual nuclear threat that inspired ""Dr. Strangelove"" which are illuminating and worth watching.

My only complaint (and this is minor) is that there is no commentary. Obviously Kubrick can't do that (he passed away in 1999), but one would think there are a wide number of estimable film critics who could offer a commentary. Someone like Roger Ebert or Richard Schickel could easily have made an effort to discuss the movie as it is shown. Maybe it's just that I like commentaries from the filmmakers or (barring that) critics, but I think a true ""special edition"" could have made do with a commentary discussion of the film as it is shown.

All in all, this is the best movie ever made. It's certainly one of the funniest, and the best depiction of the kind of paranoia that controlled the Cold War and allowed it to get to the brink of destruction in 1962.

As a documentary of the mentality of the cold war (this movie was released only a couple years after the Cuban Missile Crisis), it is very insightful, even if it is satire at its finest. One could probably do a psychology paper on the apparent regression of humanity as you climb the rank structure.

As a comedy it is just plain a gut buster.

As a period piece it contains the first big screen look at James Earl Jones,

168534,5,0800141709,"Sometimes the way that we REMEMBER movies is telling.  If anyone had asked me what I remembered most about Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, I would have said the ""ending,"" you know with Slim Pickens sailing through the air, riding a nuclear warhead like a bucking bronco.  Trouble is, that isn't actually the end of the film.  If pressed, I might have recalled the recurring images of mushroom clouds that play over the closing credits and, if someone had given me a reminder, begun to recall that Vera Lynn's sentimental WWII hit, ""We'll Meet Again"" was played over these images and the closing credits.

But I had quite forgotten the actual closing dramatic sequence, one that some people (if the reviews below are any indication) objected to as being dramatically superfluous, extraneous or just plain weak.  That would be, namely, the final scene in the War Room wherein the good Doktor Merkwuerdigliebe (the former Nazi and now military advisor to the American President--now Anglicized to ""Strangelove,"" a more pronounceable but no less disturbing moniker really) articulates his vision for saving humanity (or at least the powerful elite) by holing up in underground caverns for the next hundred or so years.

It's a chilling vision, and for those who recall the Cold War Era, it was one that actually gained some currency at the time.  The twist, put upon it here, and one that echoes a subtext of the film, is how this vision of the near total destruction of humanity actually had a certain perverse appeal to some, namely those who by virtue of rank and power, might actually make into one of those bunkers.  The blackly comedic undercurrent here is a sexual one (as it is throughout the film), since the military brass and political elite present in the War Room are, uh, ""intrigued"" by Strangelove's notion of a Bunker Haven wherein powerful men must, of necessity, mate with several women in order to ensure the survival of the species.

A specious argument if there ever was one.  The placement of this War Room scene is key, sandwiched as it is between Pickens A-bomb ride and the closing mushroom-cloud montage.  It's clear that this is an insane, last gasp fantasy on the part of the Cold Warriors responsible for this destruction.  Even if Strangelove's fantasy were realizable, there is simply no time.  Doomsday is already upon them.  How can they even hope to make it to the underground caverns, let alone gather up the bevy of fertile beauties required to fulfill their fantasy?  They remain delusional to the end--and this is the end.

168535,5,0800141709,"One of the most interesting films of all time, Dr Strangelove is a farcical look at the insane underpinnings of some of the Cold War theories regarding Mutual Assured Destruction. With the Soviet Union and the United States threatening to utilize the tools of nuclear war (sanity began to sink in following the Cuban Missile Crisis) - each to prevent the other from dominating his realm - a brilliant satire on the situation was inevitable. Highly regarded director Stanley Kubrick (of A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey) rose to the challenge. Despite the four decades which have passed since the release of Dr Strangelove, the film retains its place as a masterpiece of social commentary. And regardless of one's political ideology, Dr Strangelove is outrageously funny...

Gathering a collection of oddball kooks, paranoid wackos, and outright insane individuals, the characters in Dr Strangelove bring the world to the very edge of destruction - without batting an eye, and all the while inexplicably protecting their petty fiefdoms from the greedy hands of their perceived enemies. After all, what if some bombs are left over after the nuclear war and the other side uses them to strike at our cave dwellings - to seize our caves!!!! In short, Dr Strangelove is a film beyond description. One just has to see it for himself...

When U.S. Air Force Colonel Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely insane, believing the communists are conspiring to poison the 'bodily fluids' of the American populace, he orders his squadrons to attack the U.S.S.R. and drop a payload of nuclear bombs. The lone renegade sparks U.S. military action against his stronghold and a top level meeting between US President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his top advisors. Conversing with Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky (Peter Bull), the president tries to put an end to the crisis and avert nuclear war. But he learns instead that a nuclear strike by the US would automatically trigger a Soviet 'Doomsday' machine which will destroy all known life on Earth.

Desperate to save the world, the president must deal with a drunken Soviet Premier, the warmonger General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott), and listen to the droning monologues of former Nazi-scientist, turned genius advisor, Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). Sellers is hilarious in this role as well as his others. Overall, this movie is a hilarious series of laughs with an endless number of one-liners such as ""Gentleman, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!""

Hilarious to the end, Dr Strangelove is a modern satire that would make Jonathan Swift proud. Nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture, Dr Strangelove nevertheless went home from the Oscars empty handed. But the picture's legacy only seems to grow with the passing of time. Standout, Oscar-worthy performances by Peter Sellers and George C. Scott strengthen every aspect of the film, and the end of the Cold War only witnessed the rise of a new war against Islamic terrorism - with some similarly ridiculous ideas emanating from Washington's power brokers... Overall, this is a funny movie that puts the world political stage back in perspective. Its enduring success makes Dr. Strangelove a definite must-see film...

If you don't think all these Code Orange alerts and Rummy's games aren't farcical, you haven't been paying attention.

This film has some of the greatest comic acting of all time. George C.

I have always disliked the full frame version because of the visible boom mikes (5 in all). They totally ruin the magic for me, so i was really looking forward to see the movie without them...

However, there is something strange (no pun intended!) about the new anamorphic transfer... I heard rumours about this before i got the disc myself.

If you compare the full frame version (take any of the previously released dvd`s) and the new widescreen version, you will see that the new one is way off center. For an example, go to chapter 18 at 61,53 minutes (the radar screen). In the full frame version, the image is in center, but here it`s clearly off. It`s only slighly cropped on top (about 1,50.1), but a big chunk is missing at the bottom (looks like 1,85.1). Way more has been cut at the bottom than is actually possible on a normal 1.66 crop. Take any scene in the film, and you will see this - it`s very obvious. It seems like the transfer has been made way too high, and 3 boom mikes are still visible on top:

Chapter 5 at 15.09 minutes (very slight)

Chapter 15 at 51.10 minutes (pretty bad!)

Chapter 22 at 75.02 minutes (very slight)

So what is this? Is the full frame version missing a lot of information on top (justifing the now ""high"" framing), or is the new widescreen version a screw up?!? To me, it seems like the latter. If you look at chapter 12 (the battle outside Burpelson air force base) on the full frame disc, you can actually see the ""edge"" of the film to the left in some shots, and the round ""corners"" can bee seen at top and bottom (use your computer  - your tv set will probably cut off extreme left and right). There is only a sliver less on top in these shots. This indicates that the film is more or less in center on the full frame releases, and that there is very little  information missing. Still, these scenes are cropped like anything else on the 40th anniversary disc - just a little on top, and heavily at the bottom.

This movie was often cropped to 1,85 in theaters, and i really cant see how that could have been done when i see the new transfer. That would for example remove Jack. D. Ripper`s nameplate and Buck Turgidson`s ""world targets in megadetahs"" book. I think the movie actually is cropped to about 1,85.1 now - but only at the bottom...

If i crop the full frame version of Dr Strangelove like the Lolita DVD (a proper 1,66.1), it looks much more correct (not so ""tight"" at the bottom, and more in center), and all the boom mikes are gone too, so i believe this is how Dr. Strangelove should look when it`s properly framed. If this is the case, i hope Columbia catches the glitch and corrects in on the next release (it has to be a next release then i guess...).

168538,5,0800141709,"Nietzschenian analysis of Dr. Strangelove.

What a strange world the movie Dr. Strangelove presents us! How is it possible that a democratic society can be so constructed that the crazy idea of one person could within an hour destroy the whole of humanity! Democracy is suppose to give citizens of a commonwealth the power to decide the actions of their government, but clearly the people could not have given consent to the action of General Turgidsen who wanted to kill them all. Sure, General Turgidsen only had the power to call for nuclear attack because the President had given commanding officers this prerogative power, and the President was elected by the people. Nevertheless, did the people know all the secret prerogatives that the President signs?!

  This shows the struggle between democracy and aristocracy. As Nietzsche elucidates in The Genealogy, the history of our world is a struggle between the Honorable Romans and the lowly Judea people, and the modern idea of democracy is clearly an extension of the Judaic ideal which to some degree claims ""the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good."" (34) But as shone in Dr. Strangelove, the modern democratic state is only democratic in name. The people, despite their power to elect, clearly have no power in the actual operations of the government and do not even know all the classified regulations and executive orders which govern them.

  One must ask, America became America because of the idealism of a group of young revolutionaries who thought they were suppressed by the noble people of England! How could this have turned into a Romanic government? This is because although the Judaic mob is a powerful revolutionary force, when the revolution is won, there can be no viable government unless some sort of upper social structure is established for the efficient running of the government. Therefore, as Nietzsche describes to us, there must be a constant struggle between the Roman idea of aristocracy and the Judaic idea of democracy. The corruption of aristocracy naturally leads to democratic movements, yet democracy will need aristocracy to rescue it from chaos.

  This endless struggle between the two forces was exactly what Nietzsche wanted the world to get out of, so that we could reach ""die hchste Mchtigkeit und Pracht des Typus Mensch"" (the highest power and splendor actually possible to the type man, p20)",1110585600,,2432,5.072681704260652

This is what great cinematic experiences are all about and it proves that you don't need a big budget to make a perfect, mind blowing film.  In fact, the lack of a good budget I think works in the movie's favor, allowing it to remain timeless and completely hysterical, adding to the madness and ludicrous behavior of the whole thing.  It is amazing when a movie can take place in only three rooms and be so complete and lacking absolutely nothing.

I am no film major, not an expert either, but I think it is obvious that this film should be studied and critiqued in film schools across this nation.  It is absolutely brilliant.",1110412800,3,795,4.602836879432624
168540,4,0800141709,"A byproduct of the cold war is that it provided Hollywood with enough fodder to celebrate espionage in a string of political thrillers. Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; ""Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb."" ""The film, frequently adorning ""all-time best"" lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity. The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called ""Doomsday Device."" While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attach with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics.
This is the third outing for ""Dr. Strangelove"" on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a just above average  visual presentation. Working backward from second and third generation elements, blacks are sometimes velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. There's also alot of film grain. Multiple aspect ratios are in keeping with the film's original theatrical presentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age!",1109980800,2,2426,5.417989417989418
168541,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy about Cold War tensions still provides fertile ground for brilliant satire that has not so much dated as become a cutting period piece about the misdirected patriotism pervasive within the country's mindset at the time. I'm so glad Sony has decided to re-release this masterwork in a brand-new print on DVD, as it is well worth appreciating again, especially as we go through the uncertainty of American imperialism in Iraq. This movie, however, focuses on a different target, the Soviet Union, our then-competing superpower, and how the U.S. manages the threats of a demented general hell-bent on dropping nuclear payloads onto Russia. His motivation for attack is rooted in a paranoia-driven ""Commie plot"" he is convinced the Russians are hatching through the flouridation of the water supply in the U.S. This far-fetched premise is played out not by stand-up comedians ridiculing the government for cheap laughs but by a cast of accomplished actors who seem to be playing their roles quite seriously.

Propelled by a smart, insightful and hilarious script by Kubrick and Terry Southern, this straight-faced approach makes the gravity of the situation all the more resonant, while making their characters' failures all the more bitingly funny. Aside from the unblinking honesty of the script, the acting is brilliant for the most part with an eccentric cast that includes Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. In a triple play of comedy genius, Peter Sellers portrays a British Army captain who tries to reason with the general; the title character, a German-accented strategist with an uncontrollable right hand and an eerie similarity to Henry Kissinger; and funniest of all, the U.S. President, an Adlai Stevenson look-alike whose soft-spoken manner is challenged by the mad scramble of events that depend on his leadership.  In fact, Sellers' scenes in the War Room as President Merkin Muffley are hysterical in the very conflict of personalities that give rise to the inevitable ending. As brilliantly versatile as Sellers is, I still believe George C. Scott, with his rubbery face, exaggerated gestures and macho manner, gives the film's best performance as yet another general, a gung-ho type more than ready to take out the Russians. The climax of the film encapsulates the absurdity and gravity of the story well with Pickens astride a nuclear missile like a rodeo cowboy riding a bucking steer. Kubrick was never as funny with his subsequent films (even ""The Shining"" seems misbegotten by comparison), which is a shame since he had an acute gift for capturing the seriousness of human failure within the context of dark comedy.

The two-disc DVD package has loads of extras, most of which bring added context for the timeless significance of the film despite its Cold War setting. These include several good documentaries - an informative one focused on the making of the film itself, plus two others that trace the careers of Kubrick and Sellers, respectively; and finally, a new film that explains the sociological influence of the film today.

To enhance the business of the military-industrial complex as much as anything else. So what if thousands die?

168544,5,0800141709,"Supposedly, Kubrick originally intended for this movie to be more ""serious"" rather than a comedy. But after about 2-3 minutes of some thinking, Kubrick finally settled for this movie to be a comedy. And Peter Sellers was originally supposed to play Major TJ ""King"" Kong, but the Cowboy accent was something Sellers was unsure of. So Kubrick casted Slim Pickens, but didn't tell him that this movie is a comedy. This was some lil' fun-fact trivia that I learned from first watching this movie on the Turner Classic Movies channel. Naturally, I think 90% of youse already knew this. But I found this info quite interesting, especially the first.

The Cold War years and Red Scare contributed mass fear into the American public. I wasn't born in those years, so I cannot imagine what the fear was like. With such political satires as Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" one can only imagine what the viewer then felt while viewing these movies. While ""The Manchurian Candidate"" feared communists invading America, ""Dr. Strangelove"" feared nuclear holocaust... but in a humorous way.

The movie begins when a General named Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders an attack on Russia. Somehow, he thinks ""commies"" are poisoning ""the purity and essence of our natural fluids."" The first thought that came to mind was, ""What the-??"" Even the other characters are puzzled by this statement. But I managed to laugh out loud. Ripper is obsessed with protecting our ""precious bodily fluids"" that basically he's gone mad. After ordering the unauthorized attack on Russia, he orders the base to go on red alert and kill anyone that dares to enter. He's also convinced that commies could be in disguise and look like any soldier or any other American. The base is on red alert, it's sealed off, the planes are flying to Russia to attack (thanks to a coded message called Plan R), and all telecommunications are cut off (both base and all planes). Ripper has a British companion named Mandrake (Peter Sellers) who tries to get the General to stop the planes.

Meanwhile, in the War Room at the Pentagon, President Muffley (Sellers again) is informed of what's going on and what's gonna happen by Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott) and a large group of aides. Seeing Scott as Gen. Patton, I typically thought of him being in serious roles. ""Dr. Strangelove"" proved me wrong. This was something totally unexpected. I mean, George C. Scott's character is just downright wacky and seemingly maniacal. Truly, a major surprise.

Later on, the people in the War Room are shocked to discover that once the planes release a nuclear warhead, a ""Doomsday"" device of some sort will go off, killing all life on Earth and radiation will gradually permeate the entire planet, which will last for 90+ years. Dr. Strangelove (Sellers once again!) is a unique character. An ex-Nazi that now works as part of the president's aides. He offers advice on what to do and has trouble controlling his right hand, which has a life of its own once we see Dr. Strangelove struggling to gain control of it (and also preventing it from strangling himself). Dr. Strangelove deep down also retains his Nazi heritage by accidentally calling the president ""Mein Fuhrer"" and his right arm raised in a Nazi salute.

Truly, Peter Sellers gave such great performances and it's hard to believe all three characters (Mandrake, Muggley, and Strangelove) are acted out by this lone man. He gives life to each character, which makes all three seem as if three different people acted out the roles. Seeing this movie, I'd like to see what other work Sellers has done.

I can't help but ponder that perhaps Steven Spielberg tried to make his own version of ""Dr. Strangelove"" with his underappreciated, slap-stick, comedic epic ""1941,"" with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and... wha-hey, Slim Pickens! Like how Kubrick's movie dealt with the fear of nuclear holocaust and communism, Spielberg's movie dealt with the fear of a pending Japanese or German attack on US soil (mass panic that erupted shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked). It's no coincidence, right? But Spielberg was criticized for that movie. Kubrick's satire is hailed as ""arguably the best political satire of the century"" (Roger Ebert).

Although a comedy, it still seemed quite scary if such a ""Doomsday"" device existed and would wipe out mankind as we know it. Once the movie was about to begin, I knew I was in for a treat. And I wondered how Kubrick would be able to pull off a comedy. To my surprise, I ended up loving this movie. Dark and twisted humor interjected into the most frightening time of US history was probably the sigh of relief audiences back then needed... or were they? The movie as a whole is funny but also scary at the same time. Towards the end has Slim Pickens' memorable moment when he rides a nuclear warhead to his untimely demise. Are we supposed to laugh or be shocked? Once the movie ends, it's rather more of a down note once we see stock footage of nuclear blasts and mushroom clouds.

Nevertheless, I ended up loving this movie and I dare call it Kubrick's best work.",1105315200,8,5131,4.8493150684931505

Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb

I knew I would love this 1964 film from the beginning. As the opening Addams Family-esque credits by Pablo Ferro rolled over blatant love scenes between planes and phallic missiles and meadow lark love scene music trickled to my ears, I knew I was in for a treat.

General Jack D. Ripper (seriously) informs his British-Exchange officer Mandrake (the great Peter Sellers of Insp. Jacques Clousea fame, who plays several roles) that we will be going to ""Plan R"" in a shooting war against the Russians in order to preserve their precious bodily fluids... A cowboy hat-clad bomber pilot and his crew (which includes a young James Earl Jones' screen debut) set off to bomb the hell out of the russkies while the American government tries desperately to stop them.

It is chock full of strange and funny details such as a binder with the title ""World Targets in Megadeaths"" or the bombers' survival kits including lipstick and nylons or the Russia Premier being named Kiss-off. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the conversations between Kissoff and President Muffley- where Peter Sellers really has a chance to shine.

Kubrick did a lot of research before beginning to adapt Peter George's 1958 novel ""Red Alert"". Originally he intended it to be a serious film on nuclear devastation called ""Edge of Doom"", but later changed it to a satire to better voice his concerns. The result is the black and white classic full of stellar performances and quirky moments that rules the cult film section.

I really recommend watching the special features on the DVD.

The ""interviews"" with Scott and Sellers give a great look at Seller's remarkable ability to slide into different regional accents.

The ""Making of"" featurette is also very informative and provides a great look at the cast.

168548,4,0800141709,"Talk about nuclear proliferation -- ""Dr. Strangelove"" is back on DVD, making its fifth appearance in that video format's relatively short life. This ""40th Anniversary Special Edition"" of Stanley Kubrick's blackest of black comedies targets households bunkered for the widescreen age. The primary upgrades are the high-definition transfer (its first) and -- more dramatically -- a re-engineering into 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen.

Aspect ratios usually don't draw attention, but ""Strangelove"" is a special and controversial case. The previous Columbia DVD, released in 2001 (included in Warner Bros.' ""Stanley Kubrick Collection""), followed specs issued by the director. Kubrick's home-vid vision -- presumably influenced by VHS and the square TVs that still dominated in the 1990s -- was mostly full screen (1.33:1) with some slight ratio adjustments. Criterion's marvelous laserdisc of 1992 shifted between 1.66 and 1.33, again per Kubrick.

Columbia's latest thinking was to redeploy ""Strangelove"" in its ""correct"" original British theatrical widescreen ratio of 1.66, providing consistent dimensions scene-to-scene as in 1964. A direct comparison of the 2001 DVD and the new disc reveals a lot of lost visual information, some significant. The effect on compositions inside on Ken Adam's famed War Room set ranges from meaningless to dramatic when A-B'd. The transfer holds other surprises. The new version is markedly darker at the expense of imagery previously much more brightly cast. The older versions tended toward coarse, blown-out contrasts, however, and many viewers will appreciate the new more elegant and sinister look. Sony's restorers were able to exterminate a lot of the debris evident on the older DVD, even though they used materials several generations away from the mother negative (the original is long gone).

Audio options are Dolby Digital, DTS and mono, all solid choices, but don't expect much from the 40-year-old sound. (Kubrick wanted you to hear it in mono.) The 5.1 formats add some rear-channel rattle and hum from the bombers and some echoes, but the sound mostly holds its center-channel position. All that great dialogue from Kubrick and Terry Southern is crystal clear, an upgrade from the 2001 version, which sounds a bit hollow.",1104537600,4,2270,5.517241379310345

That's a pretty dry summary to what is definitely one of the darkest comedies ever to come out of the Cold War, especially when you consider the time in which is was made, and one of the AFI's best 100 films.

World War III was definite possibility during the Cuban Missle Crisis in 1963.  It's hard for anyone born after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist Russia to fathom just how tense relations were between the U.S. and Russia back then, right through to the Reagan years.  That's what makes this film both so absurd and terrifying.  The comedy of Peter Sellers' scenes (as President Muffley, Dr. Strangelove and Group Captain Mandrake) set against the documentary-style assault footage of the barracaded army base and Slim Pickens/James Earl Jones-et al's straight-played cockpit scenes (plus the use of stock footage at the beginning and end of the picture) show two definitions of the absurdity of war. With characters named Turgidson, Premiere Kissoff, Col 'Bat' Guano, General Jack Ripper, Major 'King' Kong and President Merkin Muffley, there is a warped sense of humour within the madness.

First, it's less expensive and you still get a good print with most of the extra features.

Second, Dr. Strangelove was not filmed at a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  While ""Letterboxing"" or a Widescreen presentation will give you more of the image than the TV screen shaped 1.33:1 ratio, it will do so only if the movie was originally filmed at a wider ratio.  If it was filmed at the 1.33 ratio and you present it in a wider ratio, the only way to do that withou having the image seem distorted is to cut off part of the top and bottom of the picture.  That's what was done for this release, a major mistake.

Third, one of the things you're paying for is an interview with Robert McNamara.  For those of you who are too young to know, he was about the worst Secretary of Defense the country ever had.  He kept making wrong calls after wrong calls, misreading the Soviet Union, creating tension when it was unecessary, building weapns that weren't needed and blocking ones that worked if they didn't suit him and was the architect of the disasterous strategy of how we fought the Vietnam War that needlessly prolonged the conflict and was responsible for tens of thoushands of deaths on both sides (ie don't be concerned about military necessity or sensiblity, just keep track of the ""body count"" to determine effectiveness;  Don't attack enemy missile sites while they're under construction, wait until they have been finished and are firing and blowing planes out of the sky).  This was a man who had no concern about people or what was happening, but simply looked at the War as a way to feed his ego.  In the last 10 years he has been trying to rehabilitate himself by pretending that he was really against the war at the same time as he was micromanaging it.

What relevance does this have to this review?  Simply that Robert McNamara is not qualified to comment on what was going on in the Cold War at the time because he was is more concerned with his ""legacy"" than telling it like it was.

If you take a look, you will see that this new ""Special"" edition of Dr. Strangelove is presented in anamorphic widescreen, with a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  This, as you can find from examining older editions of the film, is the first time the film has ever been presented in such a manner.  The reason why (and you may cross-check this with the Internet Movie Database [IMDb] or any book on Stanley Kubrick worth its salt) is because Dr. Strangelove was NOT FILMED in 1.66:1.  It was technically filmed with a varying aspect ratio (the reasons for which are still not fully explicated, as far as I've seen), but, in general, it was filmed in about 1.33:1.

So, you ask, how does a film shot in 1.33:1 get presented in 1.66:1?  Did someone return to the original negative and uncover material previously hidden from sight, lost on every print and VHS, Beta, laserdisc and DVD copy heretofore released?

NO!

They simply cut off the top and bottom of the screen!!!

Such things are not unprecedented.  An extremely similar case is the so-called ""panoramic"" Gone With The Wind.  The film, made in 1939 (before there was anything BUT 1.33:1, the ""Academy"" aspect ratio), when released in the Panavision/Technorama age of the mid-1960's was similar chopped and changed to magically become 2.35:1.  This edition was released on video and DVD a few times before, finally, it was restored to its original 1.33:1 glory.

Stanley Kubrick was absolutely notorious for his perfectionism and auteur status in the film industry, and I cannot believe that a company proposing to release a definitive ""Special"" edition of his greatest masterpiece would be so heartless as to unnecessarily delete a good portion of the screen.

Please avoid this new, bastardized Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.  While the few new extras thereon are of interest, they can easily be seen via rental from the local video store, as suplemental to the last ""Special Edition"" of the DVD (which, incidentally, clearly states on the back that it is ""Presented in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1.33:1"".

Thank you,

P.S. For those of you interested in seeing the terrible editing job for yourselves, feel free to go out and rent the new edition and the previous edition and go to seven minutes and forty-eight seconds, which is the extreme tight shot of the B-52's CRM-114 decoder book.

168555,5,0800141709,"With the recent events in Iraq and the current state of leadership in the White House, Stanley Kubrick's savage black comedy about nuclear war, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb, is more relevant than ever. It makes perfect sense then, that the folks at Sony-Columbia have re-released this movie on DVD (this is its third incarnation). However, for folks who bought the excellent special edition released three years ago, is it really worth the upgrade?

One of the new extras on this 2-DVD set is ""No Fighting in the War Room or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat,"" an impressive 30-minute documentary that examines the social and political conditions that inspired and helped shape the film.

""Inside Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is an excellent, in-depth 46-minute documentary on the making of Kubrick's masterpiece. This is a fascinating look at how Strangelove came to be with lots of information and eye-witness accounts from the cast and crew that are still alive.

""Best Sellers or: Peter Sellers and Dr. Strangelove"" is another new addition and examines the comedic genius of this talented actor. Shirley MacLaine, Roger Ebert and Michael Palin gush about Sellers but the real treat here is rare, vintage home movie footage of the young comedian honing his craft.

""The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove"" is a solid profile of Kubrick from his humble beginnings as photographer in New York City to his work on Strangelove. This is a very well done overview of Kubrick's early career but those hungry for more should really check out the superb feature-length documentary on the Kubrick box set.

Another new extra is ""An Interview with Robert McNamara"" that runs 24 minutes. He talks at length about the real people and events that informed Kubrick's film. McNamara comes off as a little dry at this length and was more palatable in the digestible soundbites on the other extras.

There is also ""Split Screen Interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott"" that were done on the set of Strangelove for promotional purposes.

Finally, there is a ""Theatrical Advertising Gallery,"" which showcases the provocative ad campaign for the movie at the time.

Dr. Strangelove is a nightmare comedy about annihilation. For the satire of the film to work, we must be distanced from the seriousness of the subject. In effect, by the film's end, we have learned to ""love the bomb"" as the film's title suggests, by giving into the comic, satirical nature of the movie. Kubrick's film is eerily relevant now because much of what he was mocking still exists. President George W. Bush is a mixture of the gung-ho, might-make-right of General Ripper and the cowboy antics of Major Kong, with the bumbling incompetence of President Muffley. The new extra material is quite good but not really worth double-dipping unless you are a dedicated fan of this movie. However, for newcomers, this is the version to get.",1099612800,8,3010,4.958333333333333

168557,5,0800141709,"How good can a black and white film with a mono soundtrack be? The satire was so biting that the release date of December 1963 was changed after President Kennedy's assassination as it was deemed improper to release a film of this sort right after Kennedy's murder.  A Slim Pickens reference to Dallas was overdubbed to make it Las Vegas instead and a scene where President Muffley falls down prompting George C. Scott's line, ""Our young president has fallen!"" was edited out entirely.

Master director Stanly Kubrick's showcase for the incredibly malleable Peter Sellers is on the ""AFI Top 100 Films"" list which in itself makes it a must see.  Sellers work is Oscar worthy as he is completely convincing in three very different roles.  Remarkably Peter Sellers was originally cast to play a fourth role as bomber commander Major T.J. ""King"" Kong which ultimately went to Slim Pickens.  Two things prevented Sellers from doing the King Kong role.  First, he had a problem developing the desired Texas accent which he could fix and then he broke his leg which he couldn't fix.  Sellers lost the 1964 Best Actor Oscar to Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"" but it is Sellers' performance that has better endured.  So far Sellers is the first and only best actor nominee to have played three different roles in his nominated film. Sellers also played three roles in 1959's ""The Mouse That Roared"" but was not nearly as well received.  Arguably ""Dr. Strangelove"" is Sellers' best work, although ""Being There"" was another shining moment in his career and his ""Pink Panther"" films were worldwide blockbusters.

George C. Scott said General Buck Turgidson, based on General Curtis LeMay, was his favorite role.  Often overlooked and especially ""on-target"" to me was Sterling Hayden's insane conspiracy theorist General Jack D. Ripper characterization.

This film is in black and white, which gives it almost a documentary feel.  Those who lived through those turblent days will be reminded of how close we came to doomsday in real life during the spellbinding war-room scenes.  Keep in mind that Sellers' broke his leg after the Burpleson AFB scenes were wrapped and that is why both his war-room characters are always seated.  You'll see James Earl Jones film debut as bombardier Lt. Lothar Zogg.

Even a broken leg could not hold Sellers talent down!  Beyond a must see, it is a must own!",1099353600,7,2378,4.905
168558,4,0800141709,"A byproduct of the cold war is that it provided Hollywood with enough fodder to celebrate espionage in a string of political thrillers. Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; ""Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb."" ""The film, frequently adorning ""all-time best"" lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity.  The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called ""Doomsday Device."" While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attach with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics.

This is the third outing for ""Dr. Strangelove"" on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a stunningly rich and textured visual presentation. The B&W image has a marvelously balanced and remarkably solid gray scale. Blacks are velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. Multiple aspect ratios are in keeping with the film's original theatrical presentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age!",1098489600,6,2408,5.401595744680851
168559,5,0800141709,"If, by some unlucky accident, I had read the book first, I'd never want to see this movie. That was ""Red Alert"", an extremely forgettable crisis-thriller, set in the ""near future"" -- a ""future"" most inaccurately predicted. Think a 1950s Tom Clancey, only dumber.

And it doesn't help that I'm not a big Stanley Kubrick fan. As a director, he was OK, but I was never much impressed when he wrote his own material. Or, as in this case, when he did his own adaptation.

Yet somehow this ends up being one of my favorite movies. So what happened?

The story goes that Kubrick decided to do a nuclear-crisis movie (a logical choice for the post-Cuban Missle Crisis era). and bought the rights to ""Red Alert"". Heaven knows why he chose that book -- perhaps he got it cheap. Anyway, when Kubrick sat down to write the screenplay, he couldn't get serious. Every attempt to transcribe the book's turgid plot into a movie came out comic. He fought it for a while. Then he went with it.

The result is one of the funniest movies ever made -- all the funnier because it's about humanity's self destruction. The strange thing is that the screenplay is actually pretty loyal to the book, even preserving the Mad General's obsession with ""Purity"". Though not his name, of course.

It probably helped that Kubrick had the cast he had. He had Peter Sellers as Doctor Strangelove. And Peter Sellers as the President. Then there's Peter Sellers as the Air Base Ops Officer. Peter Sellers was also supposed to play the cowboy bomber pilot, but a back injury forced them to bring in Slim Pickens (Yahoo!). Which was probably just as well.

Note that the multiple casting of one actor was not played as a gimmick. And there *were* some other fine performances, notably George C. Scott as a creepy Air Force general (toting a book labeled ""World Casualties in Megadeaths""), and Keenan Wynn as an uptight Army Colonel, and Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper (the name speaks for itself).  You'll also spot James Earl Jones in a very small part.

Of course, what I'm really reviewing here is the DVD with all its bonus material. Which I haven't actually seen, since it hasn't been released yet. Still, I have to doubt whether Roger Ebert, Robert McNamara, or Bob Woodward have anything to add, beyond the obvious platitudes.

168563,5,0800141709,"This film is one of the few where a star rating does it no justice.  Praise for this film is infinite.  This ranks as one of the great acts of chutzpah in American film-making.  Imagine this:  A dark comedy about a renegade general unleashing nuclear terror released on the heels of the Cuban missile crisis.  Kubrick and his collaborators(that include author Terry Southern) knew something that more serious films (i.e Stanley Kramer's ""Fail-Safe"") didn't.  They knew that a more effective way to educate the public to the dangers of nuclear proliferation is to emphasize the insanity of it all.  Kubrick assembled a first-rate cast to convey this message.  Peter Sellers plays three roles superbly: the rationale yet panicky President of the U.S., a British group captain attached to the general who unleashes the nuclear attacks, and the titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear scientist whose arm involuntarily goes into a Nazi salute.  George C. Scott is superb as General Turgidson who seems more concerned with beating the ""Russkies"" with their pants down than averting doomsday.  Sterling Hayden is effectively psychotic as General Ripper whose obsession with fluordation sets these events in motion.  Slim Pickens is hilarious as the cowboy Major Kong whose sense of duty is admirable to a fault.  Interestingly, this role was originally supposed to be played by Sellers but he did not feel he could do justice to it.  Good call, Peter.  In smaller roles Peter Bull, Keenan Wynn, and James Earl Jones do admirable jobs.  As usual, Kubrick's ingenious use of existing music(instead of an original score) is impeccable.  The sets service the film well, particularly the war room with the big board.  ""Dr Strangelove"" is not just a great comedy but a landmark in film history.

168564,5,0800141709,"Brilliant send-up of paranoid style in American politics. Cold War may have ended, but power-hungry residues endure, as evidenced in the Neo-con's Project for a New American Century with its fresh cast of Defense Department Strangeloves. Moreover, Peter Sellar's feckless Merkin Muffley remains a dead-on portrait of liberalism's incapacity to contain aggressive instincts of bomb-happy Pentagon planners. Small wonder Kubrick felt he had to leave the US to film this  iconoclastic take-down, his thanks being a spate of mixed mainstream reviews despite the movie's obvious brilliance. Over the years, I've puzzled about the sudden use of a cinema-verite style in the airbase combat scenes, which amounts to a dose of unexpected realism amidst the expressionistic style and gallows humor pervading the rest of the film. Perhaps Kubrick had too much respect for close-in killing (Paths of Glory) to play fast and loose with these otherwise atypical scenes. Anyway, they're about as stunningly realistic as any combat simulation from that era. All in all, the film anticipates rebellious spirit of approaching Vietnam era in richly sardonic fashion, and remains as relevant today as forty years ago as headline readers should recognize. Still and all, were the film remade today, war-profiteering corporations, such as Bechtel, Halliburton, and DynCorp would certainly merit front row seats before the Big Board, with a money-grubbing additional role for the great Peter Sellars that might make the demented Strangelove look positively sane.",1096243200,,1539,5.548936170212766

Sterling Hayden delivers an impeccable performance as General Jack D. Ripper, the psychotically paranoid Air Force general who orders a preemptive nuclear strike by a B-52 squadron on the U.S.S.R. Peter Sellers is brilliant in his triple role as the U.S. President, Dr. Strangelove, and Mandrake. George C. Scott also tops the cake in his over-the-top caricature of the Pattonesque General Buck Turgidson. It's hard to describe all of the nuances of this film on such a short review: you have to see it for yourself. Although the film will certainly have more of an impact on those who are old enough to remember the Cold War and all its tensions: there's a universal message in this satire that isn't bound to just that period of time.

As a side note, this film isn't far from the truth as the Soviets had, by 1964, indeed developed a doomsday device. Under Stalin's rule, the USSR was planning to dock several grounded tanker ships filled to the decks with nuclear material. The ships would automatically detonate and consume the earth in radiation once they detected a level of radiation that could only be present as a result of nuclear war. Horrified by the possibility of accidents and human error, Nikita Kruskev ordered the project scrapped and it was never implemented.",1090886400,2,1535,4.832699619771863

I must confess I did not know about Peter Sellers before watching this movie. I was recommended the movie by an `artsy' friend - you know, the type of guy that thinks Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made - so I wasn't expecting too much, knowing how these types prefer style over substance.
I was pleasantly surprised. This is the type of film anybody can enjoy, it's seriously funny. It will probably have more meaning if you are familiar with the Cold War and the arms race, but if you don't know too much about that, the extras are a great help. There is one extra that deals with the making of the film, and how at the time of its production there was some subtle opposition to its release. Subtle in that the Air force was unwilling to lend it's expertise in the design of the B-52 bomber used in the film, and there was fear that its release at the time of J.F.K's death might have been seen as unpatriotic.
Well that's all behind us now, and we don't have to worry about the bomb so we can enjoy it more as a comedy than as a political message presented as satire. I must say that Peter Sellers is a genius; I couldn't tell when I first watched it that he was playing three roles! There are so many funny parts in the film and I don't want to spoil it for you by mentioning any. George C. Scott is also excellent and has some very memorable lines.
A bonus for me was that there was a language soundtrack in five languages; German, Italian, French, Spanish and English (off course) plus there were subtitles in more languages which is great for anyone trying to learn a new language.

168572,5,0800141709,"Some films have a timeless quality intrinsically inherent with the story, allowing for them to maintain a certain amount of relevance, despite the subject matter, or when they were made.  This aspect holds true for many of Stanley Kubrick's films, in my opinion, and is true with this film, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.

Directed by Kubrick, written by Kubrick and Terry Southern (Easy Rider), based on the serious novel Red Alert aka Two Hours to Doom by Peter George, and starring Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden, Dr. Strangelove deals in a highly farcical and satirical manner the subject of nuclear proliferation, and proposed responses devised by men of power to perceived threats, whether they be based on reality, or founded from paranoia.

The film starts off with Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Hayden), commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, initiating Attack Plan R to his group, a plan created to allow someone other than the president to launch a nuclear counterattack in the event the enemy has managed to disrupt the normal chain of command, thereby preserving our response abilities despite significant loss of leadership.  Only problem is, there has been no offensive put forth by enemies of America, and it turns out this issuance was completely unprovoked and the result of one who has basically lost his mind.  Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Seller, in one of three roles), a British officer participating in a officer exchange program, and, subsequently Rippers 2nd in command, realizes this, and must act before the B-52 bombers reach their destinations within the Soviet Union and deliver their atomic payloads, in turn setting off a new doomsday device conceived by the Soviets due to the fact that they were unable to keep up the United States in terms of arms proliferation, which, if activated, would cover the planet in a radioactive cloud for 100 years, destroying all life on Earth.  Pretty heavy stuff, huh?  One wouldn't think there'd be much humor to be found in a situation like this, but then one would be wrong...

The humor comes in the form of the absolute ludicrosity (it's not a word, as I just made it up) of the situation grown from the intense level of paranoia developed between democratic and communist powers after WWII and how, once things are set into motion, how safeguards meant to protect us basically work against that goal.  It's really pretty funny to see what a mutated beast has been born of these fears, both perceived and real.  Hayden Sterling is wonderful as the psychotic general with visions of communists infiltrating the very core of our democratic being, with his thoughts on 'precious bodily fluids', and conspiracies by the red menace to undermine and sap our strength.  Peter Sellers is perhaps the standout in the film, playing three separate parts with such ability that I often unable to distinguish the actor from the characters within the film, seeing not an actor playing three separate parts, but only seeing three distinct characters in the British officer Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room"", and finally ex-German scientist Dr. Strangelove ""Of course, the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world?"", advisor to the President.  One thing each of the characters does have in common is the Seller's comedic genius.  His most memorable roles were those involving the bumbling Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, but his skills shine through in his portrayal of three completely separate personalities, one straight-laced (Mandrake), another sort of bewildered but trying to maintain a sense of control (President Muffley), and a third hilariously over the top (Dr. Strangelove).  Finally, there's George C. Scott's performance as the scheming, opportunistic, plotting and conniving, but all in the name of patriotism, General 'Buck' Turdigson ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks"".  He completely reminds me of his lead role from the film Patton (1970), but in a very perverted, devolved manner.  Great support roles include Slim Pickens Major T.J. 'King' Kong as the pilot of one of the B-52's, James Earl Jones as one of his crewmembers, and Colonel 'Bat' Guano as the leader of the force assigned to take control of Burpelson Air Force Base, and recover the recall codes from base commander General Ripper.

All in all, Kubrick has just an amazing style for relating a story to the audience.  From his use of different formats of film to evoke a particular mood or convey a sense of feeling, i.e. the documentary style use for the actual fighting footage at the air force base, to the choice of music to enhance the tone set in the various scenes.  It all works perfectly to create mock realism in spite of the comedic nature, presenting the essence of a black comedy.

The picture looks wonderful in this full screen format, and you will see that change from time to time as Kubrick used various aspect ratios in the film.  As far as special features, there are quite a few of them, including a theatrical trailer, a featurette titled 'The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove', a documentary titled 'The Making of Dr. Strangelove', original split screen interviews with actors Scott and Sellers (this was done by having the actors answer pre-determined questions, and then local interviewers could be added in later asking said questions, making it look like they were interviewing the actors), promotional advertising gallery, and talent files.  Some have called this 'The Greatest Black Comedy of All Time', and I would have little difficulty in arguing that...

My 18 year old daughter asked me what the Cold War was about.  I tried telling her about the iron curtain and the Berlin Wall and nuclear proliferation, then I realized that I had the perfect movie to demonstrate some of the fears that gripped most of the civilized world while the USA and former Soviet Union had their respective nuclear arsenals aimed at each other.

Stanley Kubrick took a chance making an over-the-top black comedy about nuclear war, but the payoff is evident.  George C. Scott in a broad comedic farce?  Believe it!  He riffs with Peter Sellers' President Muffley in a way that absolutely must be seen.  Sellers has played comedic madness in many other films, but as President Muffley he is the straight man to Mr. Scott's General Turgidson, who is out of control trying to explain why one of his Base Commanders has ordered all of his B-52's to deliver their nuclear payloads into the Soviet Union in the diabolique ""Plan R"" - the contingency plan which was put into place to allow lower level military leaders to continue the war after a ""sneak attack"" had wiped out Washington and the rest of the military big-wigs. Legend has it that Kubrick tricked several of the actors into their performances.  Supposedly George C. Scott didn't know that the film was a satire and played Turgidson straight, and after a few takes Kubrick would say ""now let's do one over the top - just for fun"", then used only the ""over the top"" takes in the film.  Legend has it that Scott was mad (who wouldn't be at being tricked) but Kubrick got the right performances into the film.

Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in three roles, and the most interesting one to me is as Group Captain Mandrake, the 2nd in command to Sterling Hayden's deranged General Jack D. Ripper. General Ripper is the kind of paranoid patriot who thinks that ""the only good commie is a dead commie"", and when I was growing up there were men like this everywhere in America. (Their children grew up to form the Tea Party.) I met some in the service too, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine one becoming a general who would decide to ""take the initiative"" and begin World War III with a pre-emptive nuclear strike.

The other main sub-plot takes place in one of the B-52s that General Ripper has sent off on Plan R.  Slim Pickens is an absolute hoot as the pilot, and finding out later than Kubrick had told Slim that this was a patriotic war film and that Slim was playing ""Major Kong"" straight makes his performance that much funnier.  Kong's crew play it even straighter than Slim, and as their plane gets closer and closer to dropping the big one there is palpable tension that mounts, ending with one of the most memorable visuals ever as Slim rides the bomb down to it's destination, waving his cowboy hat and hooping and hollering.",1087257600,10,2994,4.6158192090395485
168574,5,0800141709,"Comedy, like technology, just can't be un-invented - once it's known to exist, it exists.  The best stuff spreads quickly, ad nauseum, and this assuredly is a classic comedy.  In typical u.s.-style, we didn't just one-up the competition, we ten-upped them to the point where their comedy/technology was rendered quote/unquote laughable.  So to speak.  Peter Sellers was one of the best, and he certainly knew how to leverage comedy.  :-)  A comedy about the ugliest cold-war techs, heck, why not?",1086566400,,496,5.1375
168575,5,0800141709,"In 1964 the first of the ""bomb"" movies came out. Kubrick further earned his place in the pantheon of film greats with his all-time classic ""black comedy,"" ""Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Love the Bomb"". Explaining how a movie that ends in the world obliterated by nuclear (actually hydrogen) holocaust is a comedy leads me to suggest watching it. Only then you will know. The iconoclastic Kubrick made an iconoclastic film starring the extraordinary Peter Sellers in three roles. He plays the President, a lily-livered liberal in the mold of Adlai Stevenson. He plays Mandrake, a British Royal Air Force officer, and he plays Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist based on Werner von Braun, although some of have suggested that they see in the madman Henry Kissinger. Kissinger was not well known when the script by Terry Southern (who later wrote ""Easy Rider"" but died destitute) was turned in.
The premise is that an Air Force General, Jack Ripper (most of the characters are given descriptive names), played by the Communist bohemian and Sausalito weed smoker Sterling Hayden, goes mad. He is convinced that because water is fluoridated the Communists have conspired to deprive red-blooded Americans of their ""essence,"" their ""vital bodily fluids""...their semen. For this obviously stupid (believed only by right wing wackos) reason, Ripper overrides Air Force protocol and orders his nuclear attack wing to bomb Russia back to the stone age. Of course this is meant to show that the military is filled with lunatic fringe elements with their hands on the button. In an interesting bit of terminology, the words Soviet Union are never uttered, only Russia, presumably to ""humanize"" all those agrarian reformers. Thought I hadn't caught that, huh? Anyway, real-life pacifist George C. Scott, playing General Buck Turgidson, discovers Ripper's plan. He is another Curt LeMay take-off, bombastic and filled to the brim with sexual testosterone that seemingly can only be released by his bikini-clad girl Friday, or by bombing the Russkies to smithereens.
A plan is hatched to inform the Communists how to shoot down the wing, in order to prevent nuclear holocaust. Turgidson thinks that is a terrible idea and that as long as the boys are on their way, they should drop their payload on the bastards. The Russian Ambassador, however, puts a crimp in those plans by informing the President that this would set off a Doomsday Machine, guaranteed to destroy all life on Earth. Turgidson laments the fact that there is a ""gap"" between the Soviet possession of such a device, which the Americans lack, no doubt due to liberal malfeasance. Forced by the Doomsday scenario to avoid holocaust, the Americans and Russians work together to shoot down all the U.S. planes, save one. Meanwhile, Ripper kills himself and his aide de camp, Mandrake/Sellers, discovers the recall code. But the last plane, piloted by good ol' boy Slim Pickens, is as Turgidson/Scott describes, wily enough to evade radar, while damage from a heat-seeking missile has rendered it unable to receive the recall. They make their run. Pickens makes his cowboy speech about going ""toe to toe, nuclear combat with the Russkies"" and emphasizes the crew, including a young James Earl Jones, is due commendations ""regardless of race, color or creed."" With Pickens personally releasing and riding his bomb into a Valhallic destiny, the deed is done, leaving the Doomsday shroud to envelop the Earth. All is not lost, however, because Dr. Strangelove/Sellers, messianically saluting the President as ""mein Fuhrer,"" describes how mineshafts can be converted into underground government societies for the next 100 years. The boys all smile when Strangelove says that in order to further the human race through procreation, many more attractive women than men would have to be recruited to do ""prodigious sexual work."" Unfortunately, monogamy would have to be a thing of the past. The end.
""Dr. Strangelove"" may be one of the 10 greatest movie ever made, but its comic message was clear: The military is not to be trusted, nuclear weapons serve no good purpose, and the Soviets are likely to be victims of our aggression. Like a number of movies, however, its political message is stilted. Reagan said it was his favorite(...)",1086480000,2,4285,5.105413105413105
168576,5,0800141709,"Only mastery of ironic humor can make the world being destroyed by nuclear weapons one of the most funny and provocative movie experiences of my life.  It's all the more amazing when I consider the fact that the U.S. was in the thick of the Cold War when this film was released.
How could it not be silly to see these immature men who lead a big world playing with their very big toys?  The lives of millions are at stake but they're just not capable of really taking it seriously.  It takes so long for the concept to dawn on them that even their narrow and selfish interests are impinged upon by nuclear disaster and all the while, Dr. Strangelove watches from the shadows where his presence is evidenced by little more than the gleaming of his spectacles.  He comes out when the time is right to regale us with his nerdy German accent and to usher in a new era.
The 'manly men' of the movie normally touted as heroes are portrayed as stupid and sexually deranged.  In fact, the whole mess starts with a general who has gone impotent and comes to what is in his mind, a logical conclusion as to why it happened.  So in the end, those long missiles and giant bombs turn out to be phallic symbols compensating for an aging man's personal insecurities!
The humor in this film can be subtle at times and the dialogue is just wonderful.  The viewer has to pay close attention to catch it all and the rewards are great indeed.  It certainly makes the viewer think about how small humanity really is and how petty and egotistical we can be.  Dr. Strangelove works on multiple levels  and it is eminently worthwhile to see it and see it again.",1085097600,4,1637,4.3907284768211925

168578,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of the most biting and hard-hitting commentaries about the U.S.-Soviet arms race, overdependence on technology, the can-do philosophy of the Air Force, and the sheer lunacy of MAD, the apt acronym for the term Mutual Assured Destruction -- which was the Cold War diplo-speak that meant ""you nuke our country, we'll nuke yours.""
Normally one wouldn't think the possibility of nuclear annihilation would be the wellspring for a comedy, just as most people today wouldn't think the Holocaust is fodder for satire.  Yet when Stanley Kubrick set out to do a straightforward dramatic film based on novelist Peter George's ""Red Alert,"" a novel about an ""accidental"" nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by the United States, the more research and contemplation the director and co-screenwriter did on the subject of nuclear deterrence and all the nitty gritty of nuclear warfare, the more insane the whole theme seemed.  So Kubrick -- no doubt aware that a similarly themed film (Fail-Safe) was underway -- gave in to his impulses and switched gears from drama to ""dark"" comedy.
Kubrick sets the tone right from the main title sequence.  As the credits (and you have to see these yourself) roll, we see footage of a B-52 Stratofortress being refueled by a KC-135A aerial tanker.  In the background, the very romantic strains of ""Try a Little Tenderness"" gives this aerial ballet an almost grotesque ironic counterpoint.  Love music? In a scene depicting a nuclear bomber being refueled as it heads toward its fail-safe point?
Things get going, though, when Royal Air Force liaison officer Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) gets an unexpected phone call from Burpleson AFB's  B-52 wing commander, Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), ordering to impound all privately owned radios and to order the B-52s already on deterrence patrol to leave their fail-safe points and to implement Wing Attack Plan R.  Befuddled but obedient, Mandrake complies, setting off Gen. Ripper's plan to launch an unauthorized attack against the Soviet Union.
Dr. Strangelove follows three story threads, each getting loopier as the world hurtles closer and closer to annihilation:
First, there is hapless Group Capt. Mandrake's reaction to his discovery of Ripper's real plot and the loony logic of the general's motives.  The Soviet Union hasn't started a war, Ripper says, but has been messing around with Americans' natural fluids since 1946 -- the same year fluoridation began to be implemented in earnest.
Second, there is President Merkin Muffley's (Peter Sellers again) stunned reaction when he is summoned to the Pentagon's War Room along with the Soviet ambassador, where his increasingly pathetic attempts to defuse the crisis run into various stumbling blocks, including the hawkish demeanor of Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), the dissembling of the ambassador (Peter Bul), the vagaries of long distance telephone service, the bizarre machinations of one of his senior advisors, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again), and the inebriated state of the Soviet Premier.
Third, there is the sheer pluck of Air Force Maj. T.J. Kong(  Slim Pickens), who, upon getting the orders to implement Wing Attack Plan R, doffs his flight helmet and puts on a cowboy hat, peppering his orders and pep talk with slangy cowboy terms.  He, too, is a bit loony, yet he and his crew (which includes James Earl Jones in his first film appearance) overcome every obstacle thrown at them on their way to their target.
Kubrick peppers his film with sight gags (nuclear bombs with Dear John and Hi There! stenciled on their warheads, a buffet counter in the war room) and punny names (Keenan Wynn's paratrooper character, one who fears retribution from the Coca-Cola company more than the prospect of an unstopped nuclear war, is named Bat Guano), and his use of music in an ironic counterpoint to the visuals (""Try a Little Tenderness"" in the aforementioned title sequence, a hummed rendition of ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" over Major Kong's toe-to-toe with the Rooskies speech, and Vera Lynn's famous rendition of ""We'll Meet Again"" as the crisis comes to a stark close) puts an end to the misconception of the director as being cold and unfunny.",1083628800,3,4317,5.101983002832861

This is not the stuff that Hollywood is made of anymore. Subversive and discontented. Pointed but funny. Well acted, uncompromising and completely focused on the end result.

By today's standards it is weird. I also think it's virtually perfect. There are a whole bunch of people who will watch this and just scratch their heads. Coming away un-moved and un-concerned. That's okay because people watch really horrible sitcoms and use words like ""brilliant""...
There's something for everybody
Dr. Strangelove is a really funny movie, perhaps requiring a few moments to ""get the hang of"" and time to acquire a taste for. I hope a few more people give it that chance. Peter Sellers as Lionel Mandrake is so funny I can hardly sit still when I watch him. He also nails the President character and without requiring a mention as Dr. Strangelove he's just so right on the money.

168580,5,0800141709,"I had seen 'Dr. Strangelove' several times prior to purchasing the Special Edition DVD, but have never enjoyed it as much. The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and is still a viable cautionary tale of human foibles. Many other reviewers have gone into great detail summarizing the plot, so I will only mention that it concerns a crazy General (Sterling Hayden) who sends his bombers to Russia in an attempt to destroy the Communists, and the pandemonium that ensues.
The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso performance as Lionel Mandrake, an honorable British military officer, as the US President, and as the ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove, the half crazy scientific advisor to the President in his most over the top performance ever. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, playing a juvenile General Buck Turgidson proving without doubt that he was capable of comedic roles. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which, though not based in reality, are very effective at conveying the time period and mood.
While I think the film is the best satire made in the 1960s, and possibly in film history, and doubtless deserves of the five stars that I have given it for succeeding in telling the cautionary tale that Kubrick intended, Kubrick did take some liberties in the name of satire to reinforce his decidedly leftist point of view about military leadership. Having said that, Murphy's Law is always lurking, so I am not directly criticizing Kubrick's premise as much as I am the fundamental disregard that he had for the stability and maturity of American military personnel (it has now been 41 years since this film was released now and the precautions taken by the US government and military have thus far worked admirably.) My point is not to berate Kubrick, it is to partially address and assuage some complaints which have suggested that this film shows the ineptitude of the military: if this film was a documentary, I would already be in New Zealand. That is the point that is so often missed, this movie is a brilliant black satire about what Kubrick was personally afraid of: it is fiction, just like 'Fail Safe', released later was a more realistic fictional account of accidental nuclear weapons release. I am not implying that a release of nuclear weapons couldn't happen (although I would be more suspect of a rogue state like North Korea or a terrorist organization today), what I am saying that reality is somewhat contrary to the satirical vision Kubrick portrays here.
The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary of Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove', which revealed some fascinating details about the film. Most interesting to me was that Peter Sellers was originally supposed to play a fourth role, that of Major Kong, but after breaking his leg during filming, which rendered him unable to get around the B-52 set, Slim Pickens was brought in. I wish it had included some raw footage that had been shot of Sellers as Kong. There are also some odd split-screen interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles.
This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire. As for me, I am off for a nice drink of distilled grain alcohol and rainwater.",1080691200,2,3748,4.86697965571205

There is a subtext in Kubricks comedy that reflects the current political situation, especially in the country it is set in. between gun happy, commie hating senators and covered up pie fighting scenes, this movie could be held up to a current CNN bulletin and almost be the same: accurate, relevant, and laugh out loud hilarious. watch this, stop worrying, and learn to love the Peter Sellers",1079395200,2,980,4.804733727810651

This is satire at its most biting. Peter Sellars is the man in this film, actually he's three men. And he carries off all the roles brilliantly. As the President of the USA, an RAF general and as the title caracter Dr. Strangelove this man shines like a sunrise.
George C Scott is also great as the ultra-jingoistic army adviser, the man looks like hes about to explode when he gets on one of his ""commie"" rants.

That would put it on a par with the Kubrick films released by Warner Brothers (where Warner elected to remove the only extra on the 2001 DVD previously seen on the MGM version and provided few to no extras on all the other films). To be fair, that was Kubrick's wish before he died. He wasn't interested in digging up a lot to put on the DVDs. He felt the films should speak for themselves. Then again, that's why there are film historians to make sure this stuff is put.
A deft satire about nuclear war, the paranoia of the Communist era US and precious bodily fluids, Strangelove benefits from Kubrick's distant style as a film director. With the exception of The Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, there wasn't any political satires quite as sharp as Strangelove. Kubrick had purchased the novel Red Alert (by Peter George) in hopes of turning it into a serious look at the risk of nuclear weapons. As he prepared the final screenplay he realized that the absurdity of the situation was actually funny. Kubrick hired comic novelist Terry Southern to work with him on the final script and a comic classic was born.
The entire cast is perfect. Peter Sellers brings to life three separate characters all with their individual quirks and so different that it's hard to believe that they are being played by the a same actor. Unfortunately, as Sellers career progressed he never did have the staying hand that a director like Kubrick could provide. He gave many memorable performances before and after but his best performances were for Kubrick ( with the exception of Hal Ashby's Being There).
It's well known that George C. Scott didn't care for much of his final performance in Strangelove; he felt that Kubrick always went for the take that was over the top. He was right. It worked perfectly. Every other actor is in top form and the deadpan Sterling Hayden nearly steals his scenes with Sellers.
The transfer is very, very good. The extras are appropriate given this film's classic status. Included are a documentary and featurette on the making of the film. The interviews with James Earl Jones (this was his first film)and other surviving crew members are enlightening and often quite funny. There's also photos in the documentary of the fabled pie fight conclusion (sadly, the footage for this sequence no longer exists). The documentary covers everything from the inception of the project to the marketing after it was released. We also get an advertising gallery, the cutting edge theatrical trailers and production notes on the making of the film. Oh, and the inclusion of the original split-screen interviews (provided to television stations as a pre-packaged interview with the actors answering questions that would be mouthed by local critics later)is great. Scott's is particularly interesting and funny.

168600,5,0800141709,"I'll admit that the first time I saw DR. STRANGELOVE, I thought it was merely good.  An enjoyable film, but not one of the greatest films of all time, or so I believed.  But I liked enough of it to give it a second chance.  And then I gave it a third chance.  And a fourth.
I've probably seen this film six or seven times now, and each viewing brings something new to my appreciation.  From individual ad-libs by Peter Sellers to the complete absurdity of the whole situation, there is just too much hilarity to recount in one review.  Each of the actors appears to be having an absolute blast reciting their subversively funny lines.  Special mention must go to Peter Sellers playing three characters, and managing to make them all unique and individually funny.  Group-Captain Mandrake, the straight-laced British Air Force officer trying to prevent a disaster.  The U.S. President trying to limit the fallout (no pun intended) of that disaster.  And, of course, Dr. Strangelove himself, the ex-Nazi scientist whipped into such a frenzy in anticipation of the disaster that he delivers cinema one of its most recognizable lines.  (The fact that Dr. Strangelove's unique voice was apparently based on some actual person is almost as frightening as anything in the movie; I cannot imagine any real-life human being sounding like this Third Reich Muppet.)
Director Stanley Kubrick coaxes some wonderful performances out of the rest of the cast too.  George C. Scott is wickedly fun as the over-the-top General who isn't quite sure of what all the fuss is about.  Sterling Hayden is an utter riot as the cigar-smoking, paranoid General firing shots through his office window to protect his precious bodily fluids from the evil Communists.  And who can forget Slim Pickens, whose final scene is perhaps one of the most surreal and hilarious in film history.
Much of the humor comes from the wonderful juxtaposition of the horrific with the mundane.  The discussions over exactly how many million will be wiped out, and the efforts of the US to get the Soviet Premier on the telephone are both diabolically absurd, and probably closer to the truth than anyone realized.
This special edition DVD is quite good value for what it offers.  First of all, the film itself looks to be in excellent condition.  Yes, the aspect ratio changes throughout, but that's the way Kubrick intended it.  The sound is also crisp; the echoes of footsteps in the War Room and Major Kong's yelping both come through equally clear.
The DVD also contains a few mini-documentaries.  ""The Art of Stanley Kubrick"" highlights Kubrick's film career leading up to the filming of DR. STRANGELOVE.  Hardcore Kubrick fans will probably already know most of what is discussed, but I found it to be a very informative look at the parts of Kubrick's filmography that I was least familiar with.
""Inside The Making Of Dr. Strangelove"" combines many interviews with still-living members of the cast and crew as they recall their memories of working on this film.  Some of the more famous anecdotes are recalled (such as Slim Pickens' line of having ""a pretty good time in Dallas"" being changed to ""Vegas"" because of the assassination of JFK) as well as some more obscure bits of trivia that I hadn't heard before (the fact that many of the crew upon first seeing Slim Pickens thought he had arrived in costume, when in fact he was just dressing as he normally did).
DR. STRANGELOVE is a truly great and hilarious movie.  Thankfully, this DVD release is worthy of one of Kubrick's best films.  If you already love this film, this disc is worth picking up immediately.  If you've never seen it before, I suggest at least a rental is in order.",1062028800,9,3697,4.813291139240507
168601,4,0800141709,"""Dr. Strangelove"" had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences.  This came out in the same year as colorful, old-fashioned Hollywood fare like ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins.""  Yet ""Strangelove"" is far from old-fashioned or even colorful.  Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it.  It's also riotously funny.
Peter Sellers is a film treasure.  This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans, since he plays no less than three different characters, stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit.  The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States, and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country.  His portrayal of the title character is also inspired, and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable.
The film also sports a great supporting cast, most notably George C. Scott as Buck Turgison, who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon, and Slim Pickens, as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it.
My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing, especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets.  At times, the movie actually drags slightly, even though it's only 90 minutes long.
But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America.  It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists, and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon.",1060732800,5,1866,4.8427672955974845
168602,5,0800141709,"Kubrick produced, directed, and co-authored the screen play of this film, one which has lost none of its bite after almost 40 years. In that same year, Sidney Lumet's Fail Safe was also released. Both pose the same question ""What if someone accidentally launched an air strike armed with thermonuclear weapons...and it could not be recalled?"" However, they offer quite different answers. Credit Stanley Kramer's On the Beach (1959) with alerting the world to a possibility which seemed a probability when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed in October of 1962. In sharp contrast with Fail Safe which remains earnest but now seems somewhat stale and certainly dated, those who see Dr. Strangelove still savor the genius of Peter Sellers as he plays three major characters (President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake), joined by a surprisingly hilarious George C. Scott (General Buck Turgison) and Sterling Hayden (as psychotic General Jack D. Ripper, self-appointed defender of his nation's precious body fluids). They and other cast members create one memorable comic moment after another. The film concludes as Slim Pickens' Major T.J. (""King"") Kong prepares to engage in what he calls ""Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!"" Few other film comedies have held up this well, especially after almost four decades. One final point. I am so appreciative of the DVD format which, of course, offers clearer sound and image but also of supplementary mnaterial such as the featurette: ""The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove"" and the documentary: ""Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove.""",1058486400,4,1641,5.291187739463601
168603,5,0800141709,"This Cold War black comedy holds up today because of the madness of war, but also in its exploration of people who make the decisions to go to war, be it the generals or the politicians who have that duty, to paraphrase General Jack D. Ripper's remark on what French premier Georges Clemenceau said regarding war.  Indeed, the president in this movie rightfully says ""I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolf Hitler!""
And when it comes to nuclear war, with planes of the SAC on 24 hour standby, all within 200 miles of their designated targets, ready to go when a certain code is issued, and that is a code to a secret plan for all B-52's to deliver their payload, each bomb which contains ""16 times the total force of all bombs and shells used in World War II"" the responsibility of generals and politicians cannot be more understressed.  And what if some crazy general named Jack D. Ripper orders the 843rd air division to execute Plan R, R for Robert?  His executive officer, an RAF officer named Captain Lionel Mandrake, member of the Office Exchange Program, tries to dissuade him to no avail.
There's way too much precious dialogue, but the president's phone conversation with the Soviet premier is a classic:  ""... Fine, I can hear you now, Dmitri ... Clear and plain and coming through fine ... I'm coming through fine, too, eh? ... Good, then ... well, then, as you say, we're both coming through fine ... Good. ... Well, it's good that you're fine and ... and I'm fine ... I agree with you, it's great to be fine ...""  And that's only part of it.""  The president, bald, bespectacled, and intellectual-looking, is clearly based on Adlai Stevenson, runner-up in the 1952 and 1956 presidential election.
SAC General Buck Turgidson says on a nuclear retaliation against the Soviets, ""Now, truth is not always a pleasant thing. But it is necessary now to make a choice, to choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless 'distinguishable', postwar environments: one where you got twenty million people killed, and the other where you got a hundred and fifty million people killed. ... I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks.""
Major ""King"" Kong, leader of the B-52 crew, has a funny speech to the crew when he realizes that they are at ""nuclear combat toe to toe with the Russkies,"" but also in listing the contents of the survival kit.
Think of what was happening when this movie was released in 1964.  Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.  Khrushchev had been ousted by hardliner Brezhnev.  The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution had been passed.  Yet unjustified communist paranoia was rampant, as evidenced in Ripper's statement:  ""I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.""
Peter Sellers has yet another movie in which he plays three roles--the first was The Mouse That Roared.  He is Mandrake, the president, and the title character.  George C. Scott has one of his greatest roles as SAC general Buck Turgidson.  Sterling Hayden really delivers as the insane Jack D. Ripper.  And this was James Earl Jones's debut movie.
Funny names abound.  The Soviet premier is called Kissoff, the president is Merkin Muffley, think Jack D. Ripper with Jack The Ripper, and Major Kong's nickname is ""King"" so go figure.  Oh, while Merkin sounds like American, look up ""merkin"" in a dictionary for a real laugh.  And the exaggerated opening credits, with the small first name and large last name in a real thin font, the phallic resemblance of the fuel plane fuelling the B-52, is yet another comic touch.
One of Kubrick's best movies, sticking with an anti-war theme laced with his usual mean-spirited cynicism.  And remember, ""We'll meet again, one sunny day, till the blue skies wipe the dark clouds away.""",1058227200,4,4009,4.834795321637427

168605,4,0800141709,"Remember this is about the SPECIAL ED. DVD-
I've seen Dr. Strangelove quite a few times, and the special edition is ok, but just like all the other ""special edition"" dvds that are out there.
There is one semi-cool easter egg in it: on the main screen, if you press down until the globe is highlighted, and press enter, a screen lowers and does a quick montage of everytime ""Plan R"" is mentioned.

As for the movie itself?  Who can't love George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson?  Quite a bit different from Patton.  That's the kind of General I want running things!  Get the secretary, then head off to the War Room!;)

There are great characters in this movie.  There's not time spent wallowing in each characters mind, but you can actually get a small idea on what multiple people are all about, which is pretty rare in movies that are ""fun"" to watch.  Yes, it's black and white, but leave your annoying preconceptions at the door.",1050451200,3,935,4.523809523809524
168606,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove is at the top of of the (very short) list of political parodies in the world of cinema.  With the help of some fine performances from Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens, among others, Kubrick skewers a wide range of targets - the absurdity of the nuclear world, with its Mutually Assured Destruction and Missile Gaps, the irony of the contribution of German scientists to America's military might, the paranoia that surrounded the Red Scare - they're all here.  It is Sellers' wonderfully understated Mandrake (the embodiment of the ""special relationship"" between America and Britain - see Christopher Hitchens, among others) who carries the day, and the film.  Kubrick seems to have a way with soft-spoken English chaps who take their time getting to where they are going (think of the bartender in the Shining, and much of the early bits of 2001), but who speak volumes nonetheless.  A little dated, perhaps, but the humor (and the underlying politics) still rings true.",1050192000,8,1002,5.018072289156627
168607,5,0800141709,"This was a much better film than ""Fail Safe"", a film made the same year in 1964 that took the issue of a nuclear crisis seriously.  I thought Kubrick's use of humor to highlight the absurdity of nuclear war was quite effective.  It was rather challenging to make fun of a nuclear crisis.  But at the end of the film, you realize that it absolutely can happen if there are a few kooks who are running the show.  Well Recommended!!",1048896000,,429,4.325
168608,5,0800141709,"Mad General Jack D. Ripper of the Strategic Air Command, concerned about the purity of his ""precious bodily fluids,"" launches a pre-emptive attack on the Soviet Union with his bomber wing, based at Burpelson Air Force Base. His executive officer Captain Mandrake, President Merkin Muffly, and the Premier of the Soviet Union Kissoff, all try to rein in the bomber team currently headed toward its target in Russia, before the dreaded Doomsday Device is set off, ending all life on Earth. But why is ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove smiling so much?
One could go on about the tight plotting and even belivability of the situation depicted in the film (the opening disclaimer notwithstanding) and the unforgettable images of Major Kong riding the bomb, but the real star of the show in Dr. Strangelove, is, without a doubt, Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film: Captain Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove, and in each of those three largely improvised performances he comes up with unforgettably hilarious lines. (The comedic monologue as he speaks to the Premier is especially funny--never have multiple apologies been so true!) The obvious phallic references throughout are both funny and satirical; Kubrick's slams on the military mindset and the military-industrial-sexual complex were dead on for that time period, when the world was regularly on the brink of destruction. Somehow, brilliantly, he found a way to make people laugh at the sheer horror and absurdity of the situation. Though this is a laugh-out-loud comedy, the subtext of the film is very dark indeed, suggesting that given the chance, human beings will destroy themselves and take the whole world with them for the sake of ideology and ""purity of essence."" This film also marks the beginning of Kubrick's idiosyncratic use of music; the world's destruction is set to the score of Vera Lynn's ""We'll Meet Again,"" and the lush, serene string music that accompanies the beginning of the film is incredibly ironic . . . . Though we are not quite as afraid of nuclear annihilation by the Russians now, the film remains incredibly watchable and compelling, and an eternal indictment against the gungho/hawkish element that seems to be itching to attack anyone, at any opportunity, regardless of the consequences.",1047859200,5,2299,5.149732620320855
168609,5,0800141709,"As previous reviews have aptly noted, it is difficult to review Dr. Strangelove simply because its merits are so readily apparent upon viewing.  Filmed in the mid-1960s in eeriely-fitting black and white, this is a film that cannot be fully appreciated without reference to the nuclear paranoia and deep-freeze of the Cold War at that time.  The film delights in, in equal turns, setting up and then ridiculing all the posturing and assumptions of the age.  Others have attempted to generate farce out of the idea of ""gap"" fear (the Ruskies might have a 10 megaton warhead strapped to a donkey, we have a donkey gap) or MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction results in a military paralysis on both sides that is the operational equivalent of real peace), but Dr. Strangelove remains the finest.  The film is a beautiful and both grim/hilarious time capsule from a period where the outcome of the Cold War looked very much like it was going to be fallout (Cuban missile crisis, kruschev's ""We will bury you"").  While the effectiveness of those plans of matching the Soviet's every move and putting a nuclear ICBM in every silo may or may not have worked in ending the Cold War, it may just as easily have been calming down enough to stop pointing everything at one another.  Dr. Strangelove heckles them all, depicting a series of events, instigated by an insane U.S. base commander, that spiral rapidly out of control despite everyone's comical efforts at controlling them.  From Colonel Mandrake's discovery of a small transistor radio bleating out the most inane 60s pseudo-jazz elevator music (intentionally chosen, I am sure) to indicate that the U.S. is not actually under attack, to the President's hilariously colloquial conversations with the drunken Soviet Prime Minister (""Of course I like you! ..Don't say that, Dimitri"") to knobby-jawed Buck Turgidson's constant fears of a post-apocalyptic ""mine space gap"" that might allow the Soviets to, after mutual 90 year periods underground, return to the surface with more people and take over, every aspect of the cold war nuclear arms race is held up to ridicule.
The titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheel-chair bound German scientist now employed by the Americans, serves as a metaphor for war, a sort of personified doomsday clock.  The closer the countries get to war, the healthier and more robust he seems to become, despite repeated attempts by his metallic right arm to strangle him.  Dr. Strangelove, in the course of his wise counseling of the President in this time of crisis, reveals he actually carries a radioactive half-life materials guide, accidentally adopts a Nazi salute, and shouts ""Mein Fuhrer!  I can walk!"" as the bombs finally start to fall.  His most damning commentary, however, comes in the form of his explanation of how the U.S. might perserve a nucleus of society underground to rebuild after the explosions, explaining with a knowing leer that of course the political honchos must be saved to govern society and, naturally, many buxom and fertile women of high attractiveness must be brought down as well in a ratio of, oh, 10 to 1.  This is entertainingly similar to U.S. government plans that arose back then and are still in effect that, in the event of nuclear attack, all high ranking members of the government, including all of Congress and the Senate, and their families, must be whisked away to protective bunkers while the country they represent gets blasted to pieces.  Not too hard to figure out who passed the laws for that, eh?  Alluring if you're the one heading into the bunker filled with supermodels, not so much fun if you're not.  And with both countries following that procedure, the only ones to survive would, obviously, be those that caused it and that would simply fall back into their respective postures again afterwards.  As a side note, a telling sign of Dr. Strangelove's continuing relevance is the amazing number of references to it found in The Simpsons, which you will recognize easily.",1047772800,7,4008,4.977544910179641

But still, thats all compensated for by brilliant acting by everyone, the interesting and frightening beggining and end and some friggin hilarious moments- the president talking on the phone with the prime minister of russia, arguing that he always says good morning when he calls is hysterial and the last scene, where dr. strangelove is rambling on about his ideas for humanity while trying not to slaute hitler is also one of the funniest ever commited to film.

168611,5,0800141709,"This is one of the most fascinating movies of the twentieth century: a comedic story about a nuclear apocalypse, which was made at the height of nuclear paranoia in the 1960s. At the time, it was the very definition of a tough sell. However, it features simply brilliant performances by Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden, as well as great comedic writing and Stanley Kubrick's always dependable direction (being a comedy, this was quite an unusual project for him). In fact, the movie was nominated for four Oscars (director, picture, actor (Sellers), and screenplay), and I don't think I'm a voice in the wilderness when I say that it deserved to win all of them.
This DVD does justice to the film. It's presented in its original full frame aspect ratio and looks nice and sharp. If the blacks appear a little light and there's some grain, reflect that it was actually part of Stanley Kubrick's artistic vision. In other words, it was intentional.
Now onto the extras. The quality of these extras has put this DVD into my list of the best DVDs of all time. First off all, there's the incredibly entertaining &#8220;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&#8221;, which covers everything from production to release to deleted scenes. There is a shorter documentary, &#8220;The Art of Stanley Kubrick From Short Films to Strangelove&#8221; that chronicles the early years of Kubrick's career. It's fascinating as well.
Original split-screen interviews with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers (which were pre-recorded segments sent to TV stations across the country with scripted questions) are included. It would have benefited from newly shot interview material, but the questions are not difficult to figure out, and the interviews themselves are great.
Rounding out the extras are a great original advertising documentary, trailers from &#8220;Strangelove,&#8221; &#8220;Fail-Safe,&#8221; and &#8220;Anatomy of a Murder,&#8221; Biographies, and a Booklet.

An absurdist's dream film that put Kubrick firmly on the map and gave much-deserved international recognition to Peter Sellers for his outstanding work in three separate roles.
The first time I saw this was in my college video library. Lots of old top-loading VCRs that seemed bigger than xerox machines, crummy, uncomfortable furniture, lousy headphones. And I was laughing hysterically (in a library, mind you) for nearly the entire film, right to the Vera Miles song at the end that accompanied stunning shots of actual atomic explosions.
One of the strengths of this film, unlike most from this era, is that it's Cold War-themed story does not seem outdated. Kubrick leaves most of the politics on the sidelines to focus on the absurdity, and to let the satire ring brilliantly.
Yes it's a left-leaning film, but it's also very damn funny and never self-rightous--it's much more intelligent than that. Kubrick's merciless portrayal of the military could be offensive to those who refuse to  understand what satire actually is.

They say that the best satire contains an element of truth, and this axiom certainly holds for this movie.  The funniest (or most disturbing, perhaps) thing about this movie is that it really doesn't seem that far out of the realm of possibility of things that could've happened in the early sixties, in the era of McCarthyism and the Red Menace.

168619,5,0800141709,"DR. STRANGELOVE is one of the greatest satirical movies ever made on any subject. It raises some very frightening questions which are still pertinent. Is it possible for one mad general to trigger World War III and a nuclear holocaust? Are there any idiots in positions of power at the pentagon?
At the time the film was released in 1964 the Cuban missile crisis was very much in the public consciousness and an affirmative answer to the above questions seemed possible. Hopefully there have been enough safeguards put in place to prevent any such catastrophes from ever taking place.
In a movie filled with several stellar acting performances Peter Sellers manages to stand out. He plays three very different roles as the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove, a British officer and the American president. Pay attention because you may not recognize him as President Merkin Muffley. In the role of Captain Lionel Mandrake he serves as an aide to Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. Sterling Hayden is brilliant and hilarious as the insane Ripper who launches his bombers for a nuclear strike against Russia. George C. Scott is superb as the hawkish General Turgidson and Slim Pickens is outrageous as Major T.J. Kong who pilots the B-52 which manages to penetrate Russia's air defenses.

168621,4,0800141709,"There is one apparent similarity between all of Stanley Kubricks films, and that is everyone of them is very different then the rest. Dr. Strangelove is no exception as his only comedy, and it works on nearly every level.
Dr. Strangelove is considered by many as one of his best works. While I don't necessarily place it as high on that list, it is still an excellent dark comedic look at nuclear threat. The story jumps back and forth between a number of characters as an insane general gives his planes orders to drop nukes on the Soviet Union in an unprovoked attack while the rest of the nation scrambles to put a stop to it.
Probably the most apparent success in this film is the excellent acting by Peter Sellers in three different roles (the president, a British officer, and the eccentric Dr. Strangelove), as well as wonderful performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens and the rest of the cast. Sellers nails each of his characters, adding much of their comedic wit. Many of his funniest lines were improved, such as a hilarious phone call to the drunken Russian president. Kubrick managed to bring out top-notch acting all around here. Also, the fantastic sets are amazing, especially the gigantic War Room set comprised of a gigantic round table and three huge panels depicting the world looming over it. Kubrick shows his photographic roots as well in the stunning cinematography of many of his scenes. Characters and objects are juxtaposed in visually pleasing and symbolic ways, and often reveal visual gags.
Much of the humor, as is often the case with black comedy, is easily missed if your not paying attention. In fact, this film definitely favors repeat viewings. Each time I watch it, I notice a few more jokes hidden throughout the film. But the suspense also builds along with the humor as the worlds situation becomes more and more desperate.
The only flaws in Dr. Strangelove seem to be its slow beginning which doesnt offer much humor, and a few minor production value problems such as jump cuts and poor audio transitions, most of which can be contributed to filmmaking conditions of the time.

168623,5,0800141709,"Like most of his later films, Kurbrick's excellent black comedy on nuclear war was filmed in England. Dr. Strangelove is the gold standard of dark comedies and remains funny to this day. Made in the early `60s at the height of the cold war it savagely skewers the paranoia of the era.
Sterling Hayden's portrayal of the pathologically paranoid General Ripper is second to none. His expression of concern towards Peter Sellers with ""precious bodily fluids"" and their contamination by communist inspired fluoridation of the water system is one of the funniest moments ever put to film.
Ripper's decision to send nuclear bomb carrying bombers towards Russia without releasing the recall code sets up the stage for Dr. Strangelove. The US president attempt to warn the Russians and at the same time preparing for the inevitable with his paranoid and dysfunctional advisors.
There are so many memorable characters. George C. Scott's General Buck Turgidson adds some great humor with his anti-Soviet posturing in the famous ""War Room"" scenes and with his mistress. Sellers is great in his three roles, Group Captain Mandrake one of the only sane individuals in the film who attempt to get the code from Ripper, President Muffley and the hilarious Dr. Strangelove an ex-nazi scientist who keeps confusing just whom he's working for- the Third Reich or the US.Don't miss James Earl Jones as Lt Lothar Zogg and Slim Pickens as Maj ""King"" Kong.
Dr. Strangelove is still retains its humor. This due to the excellent casting, comedic and smart scripting and Kubricks direction. Kubrick was always a technical genius (see 2001 or Barry Lyndon), but Dr. Strangelove is also less cold than many of his films can sometimes be. It is his only comedy and one of the great films of all time.

His aide Captain Mandrake try's to talk him out of the plan, and give him the recall code. In the War Room the president is furious, and is on the phone trying to help the Russians prepare for what is happening. Soon he learns the Russians have a Doomsday device that will kill all human and animal life, if activated by the bomb. Time is running out, and things don't look too good, as Dr. Strangelove counsels them.
This was directed by the acclaimed Stanley Kubrick, and stars Peter Sellers in three roles. This film was nominated for Best Picture, and Best Actor. The film is in black and white, which was the best choice, due to many darkly lit scenes. This film is considered a classic in the comedy genre, and it deserves it, because every scene contains laughs. Its ironic comedy, satire, making fun of all the paranoid war crazy politicians of the cold war. A lot of the humor is also subtle, so when you watch think about the little silly use of words. So many of the characters and scenes are memorable. The transfer is good, but sometimes grains do pop up, but mostly the black and white pictures looks crisp and clean.

168625,5,0800141709,"....and great acting too!!
This movie has it all and does it all.  The acting is incredibly good.  The storyline is crisp and direct, and grabs your attention literally by the throat and never lets go.  The ending will do much more than rattle you.  It rocks!
A US Air Force general, on his own authority, has decided to order his planes to attack the old Soviet Union.  His notion is brutally simple:  he reasons that in order to prevent a devastating counterattack, the US will have no choice but to follow his lead and launch a full attack upon the Russian military.  Well, you know that that doesn't happen.  What does happen is pretty unforgettable.  By the way, this is not a ""fail-safe"" ripoff.  These are two very different movies and themes, albeit they share a single common idea--that ""the bomb"" might get out of control.
This movie has everything.  It manages to present a serious theme seriously, but the humor which punctuates this film like bullets is absolutely hysterically funny.  And if you don't think so, there is something wrong with the purity of your own bodily ... fluids.  (See the flick and you'll know what I mean.)
The sense of reality and authenticity of this Stanley Kubrick film is incredible.  When you are up with the B-52s, you KNOW that this is a real B-52. When US infantry goes into action, you KNOW it is the real thing.  This is another black-and-white flick that benefits from this medium.

I last saw this 4 years ago and when I saw it again tonite I was surprised by what I'd forgotten.  I remembered Dr. Strangelove being a major character, but he's only in like 2 scenes.  And yet he steals them both, that's how astonishing a performer Peter Sellers is.
Although at times it may feel Mel Brooks-ish, the director is the legendary Stanley Kubrick and he shows it with reoccuring sexual undertones and brilliant satire.

168628,5,0800141709,"Being born in 1980, I am just old enough to remember the Cold War.  I remember the controversy over the arms race, the talk about the iron curtain, and Ronald Reagan's speeches about the ""evil empire"".  Stanley Kubrick's inspired black comedy is one of the funniest, and cleverest films ever to come out of that period.  Made two years after the Cuban missile crisis and one year before American entry into the Vietnam War, ""Dr. Strangelove"" effectively satirizes anti-Communism, the arms race, and the potential for nuclear holocaust.  Just because the Cold War has ended doesn't make this film any less relevent.  Just look at the standoff between India and Pakistan.
Convinced that Communists are contaminating our bodily fluids, General Jack D. Ripper orders an all out nuclear assault on the Soviet Union.  Ripper has his army base sealed off and tells his men to shoot at anyone who comes near it.  Since the pilots of the planes carrying out the assault are ordered not to listen to the radio, the planes cannot be contacted.  What Ripper does not realize is that the Soviets have just developed a new nuclear weapon called the Doomsday Machine.  If the nuclear assault is carried out, then the world will be enveloped in a nuclear holocaust.  It's up to President Merkin Muffley and his staff to find a way to recall the planes before it's too late.
Peter Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in a triple role as the hapless Captain Mandrake, the bumbling president, and the crazed ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove.  Sellers is so good at immersing in the roles with his looks and accents, that you may not even realize that it's the same actor.  Sellers was originally going to have a fourth role as Major T.J. Kong, but Slim Pickens did a commendable job.  The dimwitted hillbilly Kong almost seems cheerful with his role with bombing the Soviets.  His final scene riding the bomb is priceless.
I loved Sterling Hayden's characterization of General Ripper.  Ripper seems to have been conceived from a right-wing nightmare, with his prominent cigar and his speeches floridation and loss of essence.  Locked in the same room as him, Captain Mandrake must put up with the thoroughly insane Ripper holding his head between his hands.  I also loved George C. Scott's performance as General Buck Turgidson (a name that suits him well).  Although on the side of the good guys, Turgidson is only slightly less crazed then Ripper and can't help but express admiration over Ripper's actions.
Some immortal scenes include Muffley's phone conversation explaining the situation to the Soviet premier (""You see Dimitri, one of my men went a little funny in the head...""), a soldier's battle with the coca-cola machine, and Turgidson's scuffle with the Russian Ambassador (""I caught him taking pictures of the big board!"").
I agree with Roger Ebert's comments that the final scenes end a bit uncertainly.  Strangelove's struggling with his iron hand is amusing, but it doesn't really go anywhere.  However, there is at least one amusing moment as the Russian ambassador finally gets to take his pictures of the big board.  Then the film cuts to apocalyptic shots of the world being engulfed in a nuclear cloud.  Never has such a grim subject matter made for such humorous fare.",1032998400,4,3268,4.925182481751825

He did it with the camera, acting and the late great Peter Sellers.  Sellers shines in three differnt roles, playing a US president, a British officer and a German scientist-Dr. Strangelove.  The irony developed is unfogettable as the Russian embasitor enters the US military strategy room trying to solve the conflict of imminent doom and George C Scott's character is overtly concerned with security of the Russian spying on their plans.

It's a dark satire, with stellar performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden. And Peter Sellers' performance in all three of his roles is one of the best I've seen. It's shot in black & white, and very beautiful. And of course in a Kubrick film, everything means something. Unfortunately it isn't a widescreen edition, and there is no commentary, but those are the only faults I can find. There's a short documentary on Kubrick's shorts and early films. There's a pretty good documentary on the Making of Dr. Strangelove. The animated menu is done simply and brillaintly. It has the original theatrical trailor for the film, which was pretty cutting edge. Also there is the trailer for Fail Safe, and for some reason they threw in the trailer for Anatomy of a Murder, though I don't really see why. Even the case it comes in is elegantly designed. This is a dvd you definitely want to get, and a movie that should be watched over and over. Definitely in the top five ever made (along with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, North by Northwest, and Fight Club).",1029369600,,1250,4.609865470852018
168634,5,0800141709,"By reading the rest of the reviews posted, one should come to the conclusion that this movie is not for everyone.  The ""humour"" is very subdued and dark and requires a certin taste to fully appreciate.  With that being said, one should probably rent this movie first to see if they will enjoy owning it.
With that out of the way, several reviews here have complained about the DVD itself.  There are two versions of this movie that has been released on DVD.  The first version was in complete full-screen (despite the box advertising it being in multi-aspect ratio), and had no special features.  The special edition (which is pictured here on Amazon) does switch ratios as the film was intended to.  The special edition also has a range of audio and subtitle options (besides the Spanish only subtitle option given on the Widescreen Edition) and is the host to a few interesting documentaries.  Also, although the transfer is much clearer than the VHS copy of the film, it still has a raw documentary quality to it, where grains appear from time to time.
As for the movie itself, it is a film of great artistry.  From the sexual combining of the planes in the opening credits to Kubrick's excellent direction.  Many people will not find this film funny as in the same vein as Mel Brooke's comedies, but to see George C. Scott chew gum while talking to his mistress and arguing about the ""Big Board"" is quite hilarious.  Also, Dr. Strangelove's speech at the end about how to save the human race not only has comedy flair to it, but also gives a light-hearted glimpse of what went through people's minds during the cold war.  For how the film combines the aspects of artistry and entertainment into a solid collective, it should be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made.  Although, most people usually don't like artistry AND entertainment.  There is usually too much artistry in this film for the people who are solely into films for entertainment purposes and vice versa.
In conclusion, this movie is not for everyone.  For people that enjoy dark comedy, satire, and Kubrick, this film will probably quench your thirsts for entertainment, but for everyone else, it would probably be good to rent it first.",1027209600,3,2216,4.722077922077922
168635,5,0800141709,"DR. STRANGELOVE is many things to many people.  It is one of the most brilliant dark comedies every made.  It is one of the most powerful protests against military insanity ever created.  It is Peter Sellers greatest film, and Stanley Kubrick's greatest film.  And, to one disgruntled soul who left the theater screaming in disgust at how ""it makes a mockery of our country's military!"" it is a denunciation of the American ""strength through power"" mindset.  It is also the most deadpan film ever made.
I know of few films that contain so many utterly perfect moments as this one.  Kubrick's brilliance is the way he takes these potentially disparate moments and blends them into a magnificent, coherent whole.  Anyone who has seen STRANGELOVE will have his or her own set of best moments.  Mine includes:  George C. Scott's obsessive gum chewing; Peter Sellers as the president shouting, ""You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!""; General Jack Ripper's disquisition on bodily fluids; Kennan Wynn's Col. ""Bat"" Guano warning Capt. Mandrake that he will have to answer to the Coca Cola company; everything that Slim Pickens says throughout the film; ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home""; President Muffley's long phone conversation with Dmitri, the Soviet premier; and, last, but not least, Dr. Strangelove himself (who resembles nothing so much as FDR if he had been an insane ex-Nazi).
In 1964, when this film was made, the idea of nuclear war was horrific to everyone.  Bomb shelters were being sold everywhere, and one of the hot exhibitions at any State Fair would be the one displaying the shelter models out that year.  Numerous movies were made trying to drive home the seriousness of the threat.  But Kubrick, instead, made a comedy about it, partly, unquestionably, to point up the absurdity of the entire situation.  But perhaps also to give us some perspectives on ourselves, on our tendency to demonize ""the other,"" on our silly assumptions, and perhaps as a way of deflating some of the tension of the situation by helping us all to laugh at ourselves.  There have been many ""topical"" films made over the decades, but perhaps none has managed to so completely transcend its particular period of time as to become a masterpiece for any and all times.",1026172800,5,2265,4.910761154855643
168636,5,0800141709,"There are few scenes in cinematic history that are more indelibly etched into the publics imagination like the image of Slim Pickens rodeo-riding a nuclear bomb on its way to oblivion.  While this is one of the final scenes in ""Dr. Strangelove... Or, How I learned to Stop Worry and Love the Bomb"", it showcases that strangely dark comedic tone that immerses the entire movie.  At the time the movie was released (1964, scheduled for late 1963, but postponed because of Kennedy's assassination), panic over the prospect of mutually assured destruction as a result of a nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union overwhelmed the American public.  1962's Cuban Missile Crisis did little to assuage those fears.  That same year, a writer named Peter George wrote a novel called ""Red Alert"" where the premise was the occurrence of accidental nuclear war.  It was made into a movie called ""Fail Safe"" that had a very somber tone focusing on the horror of that occurrence.  At the same time, odd-ball director Stanley Kubrick decided to take the premise of ""Red Alert"" of make his own movie based on it.  However, during the course of scripting it for the screen, Kubrick realized that several of the scenes could be and were actually quite funny.  So, he decided to change the tone from a serious war movie to a black comedy.  The result was a truly landmark film.
The audience gets an early hint of its off-beat nature with the first of many 'unique' names.  Deranged General Jack D. Ripper (played with commanding menace by Sterling Hayden) decides to close off Burpelson Air Force Base to the outside world and send commands to his bombers holding at their fail-safe points to proceed to bombing targets in the Soviet Union.  Ripper's rationale is that the Soviets have invaded America in the most gruesome way possible: infiltrating their bodily fluids with fluoride(!!!).  The almost hapless administration of President Merkin Muffley convenes in an underground war room to figure out what went wrong and how to undo it.  The president's main military advisor is General Buck Turgidson; a psychotic old warhorse who thinks this accidental launch is a blessing in a disguise and that America should launch all their weapons on the Russians and destroy them while suffering 'only' 20-30 million casualties, tops(!).
Turgidson's view is what the U.S. may have realized had General Patton had his way at the end of World War II.  It should come as no surprise that the roles of General Turgidson in this movie and General Patton is his biopic 7 years later were both played by actor George C. Scott.  Those who loved ""Patton"" will see the seeds of the performance beginning to sprout in ""Dr. Strangelove.."".
President Muffley enlists the services of one Dr. Strangelove, an exiled German scientist, to help figure out how to resolve this predicament (avoiding the attack which will trigger the Russians 'Doomsday' bomb).  Dr. Strangelove worked on the A-Bomb project for the Nazis and seems to have a difficult time controlling the actions of his right hand.
There are too many well-realized characters to address each one individually and still do them justice.  The true star is the way in which Kubrick satirizes the nuclear policies of the time and the overall nuclear fears.  Prevalent at the time were the concerns over the 'bomb gap', the difference between the number of bombs the U.S. had versus the number the Russians had.  When the Turgidson and company become aware of the Russian ""Doomsday' device, they complain about the 'Doomsday Gap'.  When it becomes obvious that there is no way to stop the iminent nuclear attack, the president and his advisors begin discussing ways to preserve the American way of life through the use of mine shafts for people to live in until it is safe, they argue about avoiding a 'mine shaft gap' with the Russians.  It seems to be Kubrick's intention to illuminate the absurdity of the real-life debates with the extreme concerns in this movie.  He does so expertly.  Of course, there is the one truly memorable line uttered by President Muffley when Turgidson and the Russian ambassador get into a scuffle, ""Gentleman! You can't fight here!  This is the War Room!"".
Beyond the tone of the movie, there are several other unique aspects to ""Dr. Strangelove..."" that also help elevate to one of the top movies in history.  Legendary British actor Peter Sellers played not one, but three (!), roles in this movie.  He is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF (who tries to talk General Ripper out of his mad plan), President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove.  He was rumored to be slated to play Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, but he suffered a leg injury and the role was given to Slim Pickens.  It's just as well, because one would find it hard to imagine even an actor as gifted as Sellers performing the southern hick pilot role nearly as well as Pickens did.  It is also notable that this is the very first movie that James Earl Jones appeared in.
The final scenes show a series of nuclear explosions, but not in a manner that depicts horror or destruction.  It is almost poetic how the explosions flash in tune with Vera Lynn's light ""We'll Meet Again"" song.  Deft satirical directing like that is what enables ""Dr. Strangelove"" to be as popular today as it was almost 40 years ago.",1023753600,8,5337,4.819078947368421
168637,5,0800141709,"""Dr Strangelove"" is billed as a classic for a reason: it's flat-out one of the most intelligent and hilarious movies I've ever seen.  While the movie works as a satire of Cold-War paranoia and the level of American military preparedness, its true brilliance lies in its vividly drawn characters and endless supply of memorable dialogue.  Who can forget the mad General Jack D. Ripper (love that name), the rogue general obsessed with safeguarding the purity of America's bodily fluids?  Or Colonel Mandrake, the picture of English gentility, attempting to reason with raving Ripper?  Or Dr. Strangelove, constantly having to remember that the American president is not the Fuhrer?  Best of all, however, is the indelible image of George C. Scott as the ultimate hawk, General Buck Turgetson.  Whether telling the president that an all-out nuclear attack on Russia would result in ""five, ten million casualties, tops"" for America, or defending the defense protocols that may bring about world destruction, or raving that we ""cannot allow a mineshaft gap!"", General Turgetson is one of the most consistently hilarious characters in movie history, a caricature of the gung-ho attitude that so often leads to wars.  By dealing in a lighthearted manner with an issue as serious as nuclear war, Stanley Kubrick created an incisive, memorable and always hilarious masterwork.

168639,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick, for the past 5 years or so (ever since I first watched Strangelove), has been a personal idol of mine. And if the average person wants to know what the big deal is about Kubrick, the answer lies within this film.
While it's debateable whether this, 2001, or Clockwork is his greatest acheivement on film, I argue that Strangelove contains the most of what we know and love of Kubrick. His combination of satire, black comedy, and the use of unlikely situations to provoke serious thought (and in the meantime poke serious fun) of both society and mankind are all displayed in this one gem.
Set (and filmed) in Cold War Era atmosphere, Dr. Strangelove begins when General Ripper (Sterlin Hayden) orders a full scale nuclear attack of The Soviet Union as per a somewhat secretive engagement policy which was put in effect in case of a sneak attack on Washington. His reasoning, because the Communists are attempting to infiltrate America by stealing our ""precious bodily fluids"" (he later reveals that he came to this conclusion when failing at the physical act of lovemaking).
This sets about a series of episodes in which Slim Pickens (Major Kong) and his B-52 Bomber Crew attempt to evade ""The Ruskies"" and hit their target, another in which Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British Military officer sets about to stop Ripper, and the last in which the Russians and Americans set about to stop the tragedy through the last possible lines of diplomacy in The War Room (no fighting allowed). It's in the War Room where most of the action takes place, staggering between brilliant performances by Sellers again as The U.S. President, George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson, and yet Sellers again as the mysterious title character Dr. Strangelove.
If you have seen any highlight reels of the greatest scenes in film, then you are no doubt aware of the brilliant climax in this one, but I won't spoil it for you. Dr. Strangelove is considered by many (myself included) to be one of the greatest films ever made, and for that alone is worth your purchase.",1020038400,5,2072,4.80672268907563

And Dr. Stangelove told the story better than most. Strangelove examines the insanity of Mutual Assured Destruction, the never ending arms race, and the impact both had on the global community.
Anyway, the work of Peter Sellers is excellent. He was one of the most versatile actors of the time. Not only did he play the part of the dark Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove, but also bumbling Commander Mandrake as well as the President. George C. Scott played the hawkish General Buck Turgeson, and did convincing job of itching for war with the ""Ruskies""

168645,5,0800141709,"This film is a work of comic genius released two years just after the Cuban missile crisis, the nearest thing the planet ever got to reaching man-made Armageddon. It has all the trappings of a serious political message and was not considered funny at all during its early years of release. If you are a serious movie watcher (and even if you're not) and you enjoy the best in comedy, drama, thought games and satire -- this is a film for you. There are so many moments that are a sheer pleasure to watch and remember. This film has all: excellent acting, directing, camerawork, editing, scriptwriting...you name it. This is a truly delightful film...
This is a scenario in which a US Air Force base commander goes off his rocker  and orders a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. After a series of accidents, it then becomes impossible for the Pentagon to recall one of the bombers. In a hilarious scene, the American President (played by Sellers as Prez. Muffley) telephones  the Soviet Premier on the ""hot line"". The premier then informs the president  that the ""doomsday machine"" will now auto-launch a massive retaliation against the United States, while General Buck Turgidson (played by Scott) reflects by saying, ""Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines"".
Ideas of a Doomsday Machine had actually been raised by Rand Corporation theorist Hermann Kahn, where he said that it would be technicaly possible to link a giant computer to thousands of H-bombs. If the Soviets launched a surprise attack, he said,
the computer could go to war and fire off the bombs automatically. Kahn, a theoretical nuclear theorist thought that such a machine was an appalling idea but, theoretically a possibility.
Aside from the names that will have you in stitches, this film gives a sense of the insanity of nuclear war and the Cold War -- of MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction)-- and if we can somewhat disregard the artificial visual effects of flying B-52 bombers (Kubrick has no choice; the Air Force would not give him any support or cooperation, well, for obvious reasons), we may be able to see that in its final form this work harmonizes irony... jingoistic patriotism, subtlety, dark aggression... and above all, humor. In the final sequence, Dr Strangelove rises from his wheelchair in a sudden brainstorm and surprise saying, ""I have a plan...Mein Fuehrer! I can walk!""...and the bombs explode, ending the planet as we know it, and Vera Lynn singing in her soft sultry voice, ""We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when...""

The verbal and visual gags flow thick and fast and the last scene's chillingly languid marriage of Vera Lynn's nostalgic wartime anthem ""We'll Meet Again"" with repeated nuclear explosions perfectly reflects what has gone before: satirical black comedy at its most inspired.

The screenplay is one of the best, most streamlined vehicles ever -- every snatch of dialogue, every scene is vital, whether developing characterization or pushing the story forward, or performing both functions simultaneously.
Hollywood simply does not make movies like this, with a bare minimum of music and beautiful women, and NO sentimentality whatsoever.  Compare Kubrick's Hollywood epic, Spartacus, with Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey (another masterwork without a superfluous scene).  Compare Dr. Strangelove with just about any Hollywood war movie, including Saving Private Ryan.  It's easy to see why Kubrick chose to shoot his films in England, albeit with American funding.
Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott together turn in no fewer than 5 unforgettable performances in Dr. Strangelove.  (I'd seen this film at least a half dozen times before I realized that the American President is Peter Sellers with a bald-wig.)
Kubrick's visual style is unforgettable and witty.  The decision to shoot the film in black and white, and the generic style of certain combat sequences, give Dr. Strangelove the realistic ""authority"" of a documentary war movie.

We are still in the grip of the madness of nuclear weapons and the fraility of human beings who create and control them.
That such a serious topic could ever be the basis for one of the funniest movies ever made is still staggeringly ironic.

Peter Sellers is superb in 3 roles. Absolutely on the mark as President Muffley, Group Captain Mandrake, and, of course, the title's namesake, the misbegotten Dr. Strangelove with the unrepentant Nazi arm with a mind of its own. The other great performance is Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, followed closely by Slim Pickens as Col. ""King"" Kong. I don't believe time has been as kind to George C. Scott's Gen. Buck Turgidson. I love Scott as an actor, and it is a good comic performance, but it borders too much on slapstick and edges awfully close to over-the-top. When you compare it to Seller's economy and precision (yes, even as Strangelove...it's a controlled performance) and Hayden's dead-on, deadpan delivery I think Scott's performance is revealed as more mannered & superficial. But, a minor digression from a wonderful cast and film, and a matter of taste.
One of the all-time great comedies about the end of the world! What more is there to say? Just see it! And, if you have already seen it, see it again. It is a timeless Classic!

168658,5,0800141709,"NOTE: Review updated February 27, 2006

At the very height of the Cold War, maverick director Stanley Kubrick decided to make a film about the catastrophic potential of thermonuclear war, and had Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"" to use as the basis for it.  But the more research he did, the more crazy the very idea of this kind of warfare seemed to him.  In the end, he decided that the best way to make such a film would not be as straight drama, as he first intended, but as a pointed satire.  Thus was born DR. STRANGELOVE, the ultimate cinematic political black comedy, and a film that still holds up quite well today, forty-two years after its release during the winter of 1964.

Kubrick, in screenplay collaboration with George and noted satirist Terry Southern, fashioned a thoroughly engaging and hilarious story about an unprovoked nuclear attack launched against the Soviet Union by a totally unhinged general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the ""Commies"" must be stopped from fluoridating the water and thus sapping Americans of their ""precious bodily fluids.""  This, of course, sets everyone into a state of absolute shock and hysteria inside the War Room at the Pentagon, as Hayden's bomb wing begins its run towards their targets.  The hysteria is taken several steps further when the Russian ambassador (Peter Bull) reveals the existence in his country of a Doomsday machine that will in effect trigger the end of the world if so much as a single nuclear bomb stikes Russian territory.  And unfortunately, one of the bombers, captained by a fiercely proud redneck cowboy (the priceless Slim Pickens), is ready to do that dirty deed forthwith!

The political climate that led to DR. STRANGELOVE being unleashed may no longer be with us, but nuclear weapons still are, and it is for that reason that the film still maintains its power to make a point through cutting-edge humor.  In Hayden's fierce anti-Commie paranoia, the wildly optimistic post-nuke casualty figures of George C. Scott's Buck Turgidson (both of whom are modelled off the notorious General Curtis LeMay), and that now-classic phone call between the President (Peter Sellers, in one of three brilliantly done roles) and the unseen Soviet premier, the film exposes the Cold War collision between capitalism and Communism as the farce that it would have been had nuclear weaponry never been in existence.  It also contains an endless supply of quotable dialogue that has entered not only the cinematic lexicon but also the American public discourse as well (""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room!""; ""You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company"").  And that scene of Pickens riding his nuclear payload like it was a rodeo bronc straight to Armageddon is both hilarious and bone-chilling at the same time.

But even beyond the satirization of the Cold War that he engages in, Kubrick also touches on a couple of other important themes of note.  One is the bitter irony that the people in the best position to stop a war are the same ones willing to START one as well.  The second is the theme of technology (the Doomsday machine, in this case) that Mankind is either unwilling or unable to control.  This last point has been explored since 1964 in many other superb science fiction and suspense films, including THE CHINA SYNDROME, JURASSIC PARK, WESTWORLD, and by Kubrick himself (via the supercomputer HAL 9000) in his very next film, the magisterial 1968 sci-fi opus 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.

Every bit as politically incorrect now in our post-9/11 world as it was in a world where America had only recently lost a president, DR. STRANGELOVE is a classic for the ages, the best kind of comic film there is--one that makes a point through shocking cutting-edge hilarity.",994723200,,3830,4.904024767801857

168660,5,0800141709,"This movie is pure genius.  Stanley Kubrick is a brilliant director, and it's movies like this that prove that point even further.
Colonel Jack Ripper, concerned with the purity of his fluids, sends a squadron of bombers to the Soviet Union without consulting the President.  Hunkering down in his base office, no one can get in touch with him to send the recall codes.  The Soviets are ready to respond with their own ""Doomsday Device,"" that promises to wipe out all civilation.  Does the U.S. have time to call off their boys?
The names, alone, of the characters will keep you easily amused, added to a fine film.  Anyone named Sargeant ""Bat"" Guano, ""if that is your real name,"" has to be amusing.  Sterling Hayden, in one of his best acting performances, plays the perfect colonel-gone-mad Ripper.  George C. Scott, not really known for his comedic roles, is outstanding as General Turgidson.  His straight-guy, take no prisoners attitude is absolutely perfect for this role, and truly adds a lot of color and depth to this ""black comedy.""  Peter Sellers has three roles in the movie, including the wacky, losing-all-bodily-control title character, and President Muffley.  His War Room telephone conversations with the Soviet Prime Minister are classicly hysterical, marked with totally outlandish, yet intelligent dialogue.  ""No, I am more sorry!""  But the actor that truly stands out is Slim Pickens, as bomber pilot, Captain ""King"" Kong.  His role at the end of the movie is a part of pop culture that people still talk about today.
Overall, this film is nothing short of sensational.  The witty dialogue is perfect, adding to the humorous tones of the storyline.  Kubrick was well ahead of his time in 1964 when this movie was made, and this is seen even more so when viewed today.  This fantastic film is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.

Well, guess what. you're never going to be able to answer these questions unless you watch this cinematic masterpiece. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. Who is, by far one of the greatest directors in the history of the Motion Picture. To prove it, three of his films are even on the AFI's top 100 greatest films. 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and of course this movie milestone. jam-packed with an excellent ensemble cast topped with the triple-threat performances by Peter Sellers as Mandrake, The Prsident, and the eccentric ex-nazi, Dr. Strangelove. and also joining a vast array of notable talent, including, George C. Scott playing the pure blood american General Buck Turgidson, Slim Pickens as the sharp Major Kong, who rides the 40 megaton nuclear bull down to it's target, Sterling Hayden as the liquid loving Gen. Ripper, and Even a very young James Earl Jones.
Kubrick had alot of gall to make a comedy about nuclear paranoia right in the midst of a time of nuclear paranoia. But the movie ended up surprisingly well-recieved. Kubrick had spanwed a comedy that could only be summed up in one word... INSANE!!!
The story begins with Gen. Ripper ordering a nuclear attack on Russia which, in effect would cause a massive retaliation back at the U.S. Now it's a race against time to prevent a nuclear holocaust, and still keep good relations with Russia. ""Dimitri, I understand how you feel. How do you think I feel?""
After all these years ""Strangelove"" is still one one the funniest films to ever be made. It's also one of the more pure comedies ever made. It's rare you come across a comedy without the use of perverted jokes consisting of rude bodily functions and dirty sex. ""Dr. Strangelove"" possesses a wonderful balance of verbal and physical comedy. An example being a hilarious scene where Strangelove is promoting an absurd notion of reproducing the human race in bunkers while dueling with his malignant right hand. It doesn't get better than that.

168667,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove gets humor out of everything possible.

The battle for Burpelson Air Force Base is waged in front of a sign with the SAC motto ""Peace is our Profession"" on it.

Considering its release date (1964), subject matter and its relentlessly scathing screenplay, it MUST stand as one of the most profoundly essential films of all time.

Part of the inspiration for Kubrick's satirical masterpiece came from the publication in the fifties and early sixties of such absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's ""On Thermonuclear War"" in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate.  Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake.  Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was realized some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a ""nuclear winter"" that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S.  Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago.  Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.
Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented as a comedic thriller.  As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) ...
One of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that it almost happened.  During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare.  Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).",987638400,5,2363,5.025575447570333

When the late Stanley Kubrick finished directing ""Lolita"" he said he read about 50 books on thermonuclear war and with his producing partner James Harris paid $3,500 dollars for the rights to Peter George's novel ""Red Alert."" Immediately, Harris and Kubrick began developing a screenplay for their next production they called ""The Edge of Doom.""
In late night creative sessions, Kubrick and Harris got silly, wondering what kind of food the President and his advisors would order while dealing with an accidental nuclear attack on Russia. Harris went off to be a director and Kubrick worked with the late Terry Southern.  The new title announced was ""Two Hours To Doom.""
After two months with Southern, Kubrick found the tone and story he felt best expressed his very serious concerns for an eminent nuclear holocaust.
This brilliant, dark farce with its numerous haunting images has become a part of our collective experience.  Although released in 1964 at the height of Cold War fears, the madness of nuclear war for whatever cause has never been better portrayed.  Nor more relevant.
Peter Sellers inhabits three distinct characters in a performance that is unmatched anywhere.  Incredibly, some of his most memorable lines, like the fey phone apology to the Soviet Premiere for the accidental nuclear strike, were improvised.
George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wyn and the extraordinary Slim Pickens (in a part that was originally to have been played by Sellers until he fell 15 feet out of the B-52 set and hurt himself!) are all operating at the peak of their remarkable powers and under the direction of a perfectly focused Kubrick.
""Dr. Strangelove"" has been available before, individually and as part of a Kubrick DVD collection.
This new digitally mastered audio and video transfer seems even sharper and the incredibly black and white cinematography is pristine.
Superior bonus material includes a terrific new documentary on Kubrick as well as an ""Inside The making of Dr. Strangelove"" and more. (UK, Columbia Pictures, Black & White, Full Theatrical Print, 104  Minutes, Rated PG, 1964)",985478400,8,2141,5.194202898550724
168673,5,0800141709,"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worryingand Love the Bomb
Score: 98/100
Peter Sellers playing 3 roles. George C. Scott supporting him. Stanley Kubrick directing. South American's accents been mocked. It all sounded like heaven. And it was. Everyone got more out of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb than anyone had the right to expect for an independent film of 1964.
U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely and utterly mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a ""Doomsday Device"" which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Permier; and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that ""such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious"". Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world?
George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones are all excellent in memorable scenes, but this is clearly Sellers' show, even over Stanley Kubrick's never-better directing detail. Sellers' performance is one of the most stunning, extraordinary and utterly brilliant performances ever put to screen. He always gives the film its comedy and he'll put a smile on your face, and volcanically erupts the comic humour deep down in his intriguing characters. There are many classical scenes; the phone conversation between a woman in a bikini who argues with her bosses' boss; the hilarious quote ""Gentleman - you can't fight in here, this is the war room"" and of course that ending, a final shot in a film that is one of the finest to memory.
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb has one of the longest titles in film history, but damn, it's all over too quickly! But, since there is not a film by Stanley Kubrick that matches this one, it's a must-buy, and you'll be staring at Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb all day after you've spent your money.

General Curtis ""Boom Boom"" LeMay was known for violating Soviet air space, in what many considered an overt attempt to provoke something ""toe to toe with the Rooskies"".  Jack Kennedy made some powerful enemies for peacefully de-escalting the Cuban missle crisis.  Kubrick (and Terry Southern) responded with a brilliant film, featuring classic performances  (including the multi-role brilliant improvisation from Peter Sellers that built from their collaboration in Lolita).  It's impact was to change the topic of conversation from ""strategic"" to ""mutually assured destruction"", helping world opinion to back away from the brink of a casual option (such as calling it for Vietnam).

While some of the dialogue is quite hilarious there's a profound message at its core. Kubrick quite deftly points out the lunacy of the nuclear arms race. It's as though he sugar-coated the medicine without lessening any of its effect.

Terry Southern's screenplay is so full of memorable lines that you might as well place quotation marks at either end. As he had already demonstrated in Kubrick's ""Lolita"", Peter Sellers shows an uncanny ability at playing mulitple characters, affecting a German and American accent that sound as natural as his native Queen's English in this outing. George C. Scott bellows, gesticulates, cajoles, glowers, sulks and generally pulls every face known to mankind in the most deliciously hammy performance of his career as the hilariously named General Buck Turgidson.

168680,5,0800141709,"This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors, Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end.

The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once, in fact twice, by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be, though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945, for oil, for uranium, for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa, or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars, apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain (not so many) and France (essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria) were the deeds of the USA: Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East, and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen, armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS.

 In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience. And it is a success and it is still valid.

The argument is that there will always be some crazy guy who will be able to bypass all limitations and firewalls to play a trick on the world, on the USSR at the time and Russia nowadays, or even China for the more reckless, and manage a bomb and today a missile to reach the other side and start the ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC responding defense that would become a tremendous back-attack or act of final justified but lethal compensation. As the one who started the scare in this film, and the final holocaust, says so well just before committing suicide I believe there is another life on the other side! That is in the drastic situation the most humorous, a very black humor indeed, remark you can utter.

The mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove is the most frighteningly hilarious character you can imagine, selling his nuclear knowledge and knowhow to the USA with only one intention: to get to the nuclear holocaust he had been preparing in Germany for Hitler and he was not able to perform or achieve. He is mad, he is deranged, he is physically handicapped, he is erratic and his artificial arm is only remembering his glorious Nazi time and is taking over from time to time to salute his leader, Heil and Heil again.

All that is dealt with humorously but it is dramatic and today in the situation of two wars, in Afghanistan on one side, and in Iraq-Syria on the other hand, plus the Korean situation that is poisoned by the unpredictable erratic attitude of President Trump in front of a young leader in North Korea who is either right to resist American imperialism or wrong to endanger the survival of the whole planet, today we can feel it resonate with strength and power.

Can there be any reasonable tempered, and well-tempered at that, moderate and realistic compromise to find a solution to the problem without having the USA continuing in their unacceptable track of dictating what one man, one president wants, even when this is purely unethical and absurd? No one in the world, and certainly not any god in existence, has the right to dictate to other countries what they have to do and what norms they have to respect and implement: the one size fits all of the Monroe Doctrine has to be once and for all sent back to the prop-store of an out-of-use theater.

TO DIE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, WHAT A JOY!
Amazon February 11, 2001

Kubrick touches a very sensitive subject in this film, a subject that should remind us of man's supreme ability at destroying himself and surviving his own destruction. He points out how any nuclear protocol has a hole somewhere or a loophole to go around any kind of security precautions. Nuclear weapons are our unredeemable doom. They can only lead to a catastrophe.

And humanity is such that it will enjoy destroying itself and then mobilize its intelligence to just survive in order to start again. There is no hope what so ever. Kubrick deals with this subject in a very humorous way but every detail is there to show that the patriotic motivation of any man justifies in his mind any possible crime or just folly. Man is a fool and his foolishness can know no end.

168681,5,0800141709,"The US Air Force, National Command Authority and Pentagon take a big hit in this satirical feature about the Cold War when a deranged Air Force General orders his B-52 bomber wing to attack the Soviet Union without authorization of the President.  A madcap series of events unfold as the President and his military forces attempt to find the communication codes to recall the B-52 crews.  The humor is very dark as it follows events in the Pentagon War Room, the air force base of the renegade General, and the cockpit of a lone B-52 crew.  Peter Sellers dominates the movie, starring in three roles as the President trying to prevent nuclear war, Colonel Mandrake the airbase executive officer attempting to get the recall codes from his psychotic commander, and Dr. Strangelove, the ex-Nazi scientist on the President's staff.  George C. Scott steals some scenes as General Turgison, the senior Air Force General who tries to make the situation less than it is, and then later recommending full-scale attack as a course of action.  Sterling Hayden is very funny as General Jack Ripper, the one responsible for issuing the orders to the B-52 crews, and Slim Pickens is excellent as the cowboy pilot flying his B-52 bomber into Soviet territory.  The movie pulls no punches in its portrayal of the leaders attempting to find a solution to the monumental crisis they face.  The humor makes light of the impending disaster and delivers a message about the irony of nuclear warfare and the danger of having so much destructive power on tap.  In one sequence, an Army airborne division is ordered to attack General Ripper's airbase and locate him for the recall codes, what follows is a large battle between Air Force security personnel and Army paratroopers.  Out of this chaos at the Pentagon and the airbase, the only person who appears to know what he's doing is the B-52 pilot.  The movie sets are impressive and an interesting portion of the movie is the B-52 crew scenes.  The set looks very realistic with the crew enclosed inside a claustrophobic flight deck, going through their drills to find the target and avoid Soviet air defenses.  It's a landmark movie that is remarkable for its controversial treatment of the Cold War, witty screenplay and final message.  This could arguably be Stanley Kubrick's best work.  For viewers interested in a more serious approach, the movie ""Fail Safe"" is worth seeing.  It was released some months later in 1964 and offers a remarkably similar story, but in a more dramatic and shocking atmosphere.",981676800,12,2542,4.892773892773893
168682,5,0800141709,"I would have loved to been a fly on the wall when the producers of ""Dr. Strangelove"" tried to sell it to the studio.
""Well, you see, guys, this film is about worldwide Armageddon. This Air Force general goes nuts because he thinks the Russians are sapping his semen with flouride, and he sends his B-52s to attack them. Problem is, if his forces succeed, the Russians will set off a doomsday machine that will kill all life on Earth. The president tries to consult with the Russian premier on the hotline, but the premier is too drunk to understand what's going on. So, the wrap up is that one American plane succeeds in getting through, and the pilot has to ride the H-bomb down to its target, like a bucking bronco. The world ends. Oh, and it's a comedy.""
Thank God for Hollywood of yore...could you imagine today's studios saying, ""Sure, we'll pony up about $50 million for this one""? Not a chance.
That's what makes ""Dr. Strangelove"" such a treasure: no movie like this will ever be made again. It is horrific and viciously comedic at the same time. It is also masterfully crafted, as you'd expect from a Stanley Kubrick film, and aside from some cheesy visual effects of a B-52, it doesn't feel the least bit dated.
If anything, the film's sarcastic, irreverent tone fits the cynical 21st century far better than the 1960's, a time when the president was a national hero. Am I the only one who can see Bill Clinton's face lighting with happiness at the prospect of being locked in a mineshaft for a hundred years with ten ""highly stimulating"" women?
But in the idealistic world of 1964, such thoughts were absolutely radical, which makes ""Dr. Strangelove"" more than a great moviegoing experience; it was a cultural watershed, ushering in the cynical late 1960's with a distinct ""bang.""
Of course, no review of this film would be complete without some of its absolutely amazing moments: General Ripper's speech about his ""precious bodily fluids""; George C. Scott's megalomaniacal, hyperactive General Buck Turgidson, who argues for an all-out attack on Russia because the worst they can do is ""muss our hair""; Slim Pickens' Major Kong, who, upon inspection of a survival kit (complete with nylons and a miniature Bible/Russian phrase book), declares that ""a guy could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all this stuff""; and, of course, Peter Sellers' brilliant triple role as the befuddled U.S. president (who declares, ""no fighting in the War Room!""), the properly British but quite persistent Captain Mandrake, and the self-asphyxiating ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove.
The film is also a feast for the eyes; Ken Adam's ""war room"" set is absolutely smashing (in fact, Ronald Reagan, upon touring the real War Room in the Pentagon, complained that it didn't look nearly as impressive as it did in this film), and the footage of the ""battle"" for General Ripper's air base is amazingly realistic. The interior set of Major Kong's B-52 was painstakingly constructed from pictures of a real B-52 (as you'd expect, the Defense Department refused to cooperate in the making of this film), and is absolutely convincing.
Kubrick's direction is flawless, and manages to combine his well-known knack for ice-cold intellect with warm and very human performances.

Liberalism, conservatism, capitalism, communism- they all become moot in the face of extinction.
  So we have ""Dr. Strangelove,"" the movie that dares point out how our drive to destroy ourselves just might be some sort of twisted outgrowth of our libido.  Hardly a moment goes by in this film without sexual text or context.  Even the two bombs in the B-52 (named by its crew, ""Leper Colony"") are scribbled with what were then considered come-on lines.  Deranged Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has sent his air wing into the Soviet Union because he felt a ""loss of essence"" during the ""physical act of love,"" and is certain this is caused by flouridated water.
  Peter Sellars plays three roles, wimpy President Muffley, RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake and the title character, the bizarre, wheelchair-bound not-so-former Nazi advisor to the President.  The awesome George C. Scott turns in a marvelous performance as Gen. Buck Turgidson, who has difficulty hiding his enthusiasm for Ripper's plan.
  But the revelation here is Hayden (veteran of many a manly role), playing a character so concerned with losing his virility, he sets the world on course for an explosive and very final climax.  Hayden's performance is a masterpiece of subtle derangement- no drooling or chewing the scenary.  Watch for Sellar's reaction when he realizes Hayden's burly, muscular symbol of American power, in his medal-bejeweled Air Force uniform, is completely, irretrievably round the bend.  It's a moment of pure, comic horror.
  Sellars' characterization of Dr. Strangelove is the epitome of the post-nuclear man as monster.  He's completely comfortable, almost gleeful, when talking about mass-murder as an abstraction and a political expediency.
  Beautifully filmed in black and white (which gives it a certain Cold War veracity) and featuring some impressive sets and effective, documentary-style combat footage, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is one of Stanley Kubrick's finest films, uncompromising as it condemns hubris and macho posturing on all sides.  And it does it with a weapon hopefully more effective in the long run than A-bombs and H-bombs.  Humor.

168690,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among  the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it  is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right  after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban  Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about  nuclear annihilation.  Average Americans were spending their life savings  to build bomb shelters in their basements.
A strong anti nuke sentiment  was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was  one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was ""Fail Safe""  starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that  depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a  nuclear attack on Russia.  ""Fail Safe"" conveyed its anti war message  through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the  most cavalier of viewers.  ""Strangelove"" accomplished its purpose through  brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd  caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at  its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it  was first released than it is today.
Kubrick's direction was nothing  short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and  ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For  instance, most of the names had sexual connotations.  Strangelove  (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin  (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson  (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex  took place with a sign that said, ""Peace Is Our Profession"" in the  background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, ""You can't fight  in here, this is the War Room!""
The entire ensemble gave superlative  performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the  President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line  after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously  to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr.  Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently  calling the President, ""Mein Fuhrer"".  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and  it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.
George C. Scott  was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the  butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a  harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially  the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments.  And who can  forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the  nuke to ground zero in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the  history of film.
This is one of the most creative, witty and effective  lampoons ever done.  It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people  who take themselves all too seriously, and by making us laugh at that of  which we are most afraid.  I rated it a perfect 10.  ""AAAAAHooooo!""",968284800,,3229,5.045889101338432
168691,5,0800141709,"The title character of this movie (played by Peter Sellers) is at least  loosely based on the brilliant mathematician John von Neumann of Princeton  university.  von Neumann was one of the pioneers of early computers (among  other things).  He was also decidedly anti-Soviet Union & many times  advocated the US delivering a first strike against her (at that time, it  was believed that the US could win a nuclear exchange with  ""acceptable"" losses).
Sellers also plays 2 other parts in the  movie.  One is a British exchange officer who is serving at a US Air Force  Base.  His other part is as the president of the United States.  (It should  be noted that these are about the lone 2 characters who actually show any  sense in this whole movie).  The credits also feature George C. Scott as  a  hell-for-leather general and a very young James Earl Jones as a  bombadeer.
""Dr. Strangelove"" is a wonderful, delightful, fun  movie that deals with one of the most horrifying events imaginable;  a mad  Air Force general independently ordering his bombers to strike Russia.  Meanwhile, the politicians and senior military staff muddles around,  worrying about such thing as the calibre of bomb shelters that the US has  vs. the Soviet Union (not realizing the whole time that it makes no  difference who has better bomb shelters - everyone will die, anyway).  A  great film of the end-of-the-world variety!",968112000,2,1403,4.880341880341881
168692,5,0800141709,"An irony here is that if Peter Sellers died from the massive heart attack that he recieved in April 1964, this would have been his penultimate film.  'Being There' (1979) turned out to be his penultimate film and in both  instances here, Sellers was nominated for an Oscar which he failed to get.  That aside, Sellers is at his best here and the use of black and dry comedy  gives us an occasional glimpse as to what Sellers would have been like as a  serious actor in the Guinness mould. The scene where Group Captain Mandrake  finds that his American counterpart is a madman for example. The film  itself is excellent, picking away at the difference between evil paranoia  and justified concern, concerning communism. The style of direction is pure  Kubrick, the camera shots and acting style for example, particually in the  War Room scenes. And if none of this attracts you, it is worth watching  just to see Major Kong go through his check list on the plane he his flying  to bomb Moscow.

168693,5,0800141709,"I've read most of the reviews for this movie on Amazon and have seen only one passing mention of Terry Southern, the brilliant and now sadly almost  forgotten novelist/screenwriter who was practically solely responsible for  the black humor in this movie wrongly attributed to Kubrick. Southern's  screenplay was essentially a satirical revision of the rather conventional  end-of-the-world novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George (who shares  the writing credits along with Kubrick and Southern.)  As a matter of fact,  when ""Dr. Strangelove"" first came out in 1962, it had been  Southern who received all of the credit, resulting in angry full-page  denunciations by Kubrick in, I believe, the New York Times, stating that  Southern ""had nothing to do with it."" Of course, anyone who has  read ""The Magic Christian"" or ""Flash and Filigree""  would realize this is absurd. Terry Southern also encountered this problem  some years later when Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper made the same  accusation against him regarding the screenplay of ""Easy Rider"",  of which, once again, Southern was the sole author. While I acknowledge  that Stanley Kubrick was a great director, he was also a megalomaniac known  for taking all the credit for the greatness of his films, a slightly  ridiculous stance, I believe, given the inherently collaborative nature of  the medium. And because of this tendency, he helped to bury the reputation  of one of the most talented writers of his generation. Writing and  directing aside, the acting in this movie is impeccable. I am a huge fan of  Peter Sellers, and it is perhaps with this movie that he definitively  proved that, as a character actor and vocal impressionist, he has no equal  in the history of recorded film.",965088000,,1742,5.074204946996466
168694,5,0800141709,"I have seen ""Dr. Strangelove"" over 100 times which proves either I need to get a life or I have very good taste. I hope it's the latter.
This is, quite simply, the most complete and the most brilliant  film ever made. There is not one boring, poorly acted or superfluous scene  in the entire movie. The performances are simply outstanding. Peter Sellers  in his three roles is, as always, superlative. But George C. Scott, not  generally noted for comedy, proves he is a comedic actor of the highest  order.
Slim Pickens gives an absolutely hilarious performance as Major  Kong. Watch how he takes his cowboy hat out of the safe, and his accent  when he delivers the classic line, ""A fella could have a pretty good  weekend in Vegas with all that stuff!""
Keenan Weenan delivers an  absolutely dead-on performance as Bat Guano (""if that really is your  name..."") and Kubrick somehow managed to drag a riveting performance  out of Sterling Hayden, not normally known as any great shakes in the  acting department.
This film is gorgeously directed, paced and is  literally perfect. Watch particularly the lengthy scenes in the war room,  with Sellers as President Muffley delivering his lines in a flat midwestern  American accent to Dimitri, the fun-loving Russian premiere.

168701,5,0800141709,"For a long time, I didn't really understand this movie. The plot is pretty straightforward: a mad Air Force general orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the two countries have to stop the attack before it sets  off the dreaded Doomsday Machine. Just as it looks as though the day has  been won, suddenly...ah, but we can't reveal the ending for those of you  who haven't seen it.
And yet, buried underneath this Cold War suspense  plot, there is one of the darkest, sexually tinged black comedies ever  made. It was the ""buried underneath"" part that confused me.  But  my curiosity about the film led me to the public library, where I checked  out a book that would open my eyes to the ""meaning"" of Kubrick's  works, and help me to ""understand"" movies in general:  ""Stanley Kubrick Directs"" by Alexander Walker. I read the essays  presented in this fascinating book, and I puzzled over the author's  discovery of sexual metaphors buried within nearly every frame of Dr.  Strangelove. ""Sex! Sex! Sex!"" the movie screams -- according to  the book. Sex in the form of the mad general who is impotent, and strikes  back against the world, finally killing himself when he cannot achieve his  orgasm. Sex in the form of Dr. Strangelove himself, who is so excited with  the idea that his mad plan is going to be implemented that he loses control  of his own body, starts jerking his arm in phallic ""Seig Heil""  motions, and gets out of his own chair and walks ""erect!"" And sex  all over the place, from Buck Turgidson's secretary to Colonel Bat Guano  and his obsession with ""deviated preverts"" and nuclear bombs with  ""Hi There!"" and ""Dear John"" written on them.
Reading  this interpretation of the movie encouraged me to turn opn the VCR and  watch Dr. Strangelove once again...and the movie did indeed begin to fall  into place. I could see where the author was coming from, though much of it  seemed confusing to me...until one crucial moment, when the nuclear attack  has been called off (or so everyone thinks), and General Turgidson calls  out for everyone to bow their heads and utter a (kypocritical) prayer of  thanks. Suddenly, as the heads of state are saying their prayers, we see  Dr. Strangelove sitting far away, in a corner, shrouded in light from the  screens so that his image is little more than a silhouette. But despite the  fact that we can barely see him, we can practically *feel* his emotions:  disappointment, or possibly even anger. This man had actually WANTED the  world to end, and when it did not occur he was disappointed, or frustrated,  or even furious.
And with that single shot, that single moment, the  meaning of Dr. Strangelove suddenly clicked into place for me.
Ever since  then, I've looked upon Stanley Kubrick's films with a different eye -- and,  I hope, upon movies in general...or indeed, upon our society in general.  For I now believe that there is indeed a hidden, subliminal  ""language"" of interpretation that exists, if we know where to  look for it. And I have Stanley Kubrick and DR. STRANGELOVE to thank for  opening my eyes.  This unforgettable nightmare comedy of nuclear  Armegeddon, hysteria, and sexual innuendoes seems to get better with each  passing year. The Cold War may be over, but the nightmare of nuclear  holocaust hasn't ended, and indeed the slow collapse of the  military-industrial complex only seems to make nuclear disaster of some  sort more inevitable over time. (The possibility of nuclear terrorism,  environmental disaster of some sort, or nuclear war between unstable powers  such as India and Pakistan is currently growing at a frightening rate.)  Kubrick had the audacity to show us what a sick joke the whole prospect of  the arms race is, and even today a frightening number of people fail to get  the punchline. I find myself returning to this movie time and again, when  I'm despondent and feel like laughing at what a sick joke the world can be.",957916800,5,3940,4.767062314540059

The propaganda surrounding the ""general crisis of  hostile nuclear invasions"" was a front to allow for the continued  stockpiling of nuclear weopons, and it was a liscence for the contiuned  'orgasmic' detonation (check this theme out as a metaphor and motif in the  film!) of sub-aqueous, atmospheric, sub-terranian as well as surface  detonations throughout the 50's and early 60's.

Dr. Strangelove depicts this paranoia to the extreme,  having an Air Force Commander (General Ripper) order nuclear bombings of a  number of Russian Strategic Sites. Regularly the president was the only  person in the United States who had the power to order the use of nuclear  weapons, but General Ripper exceeded his authority. General Ripper ordered  the use of ""Plan R,"" which was only supposed to have been used  when the normal chain of command was disrupted by a Russian Sneak Attack.  The paranoid General Ripper was motivated to start a Nuclear War by his  theory of the fluoridation of water, claiming it was the most dangerous  communist plot Americans had to face. His unauthorized use of Plan R was to  stop ""the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all  of our precious bodily fluids""  -referring to the fluoridation of  water.  America's anti-Communist expansion ideals spread on to American  Society through stereotypes of communists. Russians were labeled as  ""drunken peons"" who will assimilate the world. Dr. Strangelove  demonstrates communist stereotypes, depicting Russians as being unable to  rise to the occasion during the brink of a global holocaust. The Russian  Premier was drunk during a phone conversation with the President of the  United States, while the President was trying to caution the Premier of the  possible nuclear destructions of several Russian Strategic Sites. After the  phone conversation, the Russian Ambassador warns of a Doomsday Device that  will automatically trigger itself off at any sign of danger, and cannot be  deactivated. The Doomsday Device was designed to deter any enemy from  attacking Russia, in fear of a global Doomsday Shroud that would inhabit  the earth for nearly 93 years. The device was only good if the world knew  about it, but because of the Premier's love for surprise, it was supposed  to have been announced on Monday -stereotyping Russian lack of common  sense.  The Cold War was the practically the most frightening period of  time the entire world had to face. Two major world powers, with weapons of  mass destruction, on the brink of a Nuclear War sending the world into a  Nuclear Winter is a conception that no human would want to imagine.  Paranoia and stereotypes are just things we are afraid might be true and  might happen, but they are nonetheless the cornerstones in starting a  conflict, and the more powerful they are...the more frightening the conflict.  But there is no harm in watching it on TV or Movie Theater unfolding in  unreal and hilarious circumstances.",946771200,,3260,5.089015151515151

The hallucinating atmosphere of quickly getting closer and closer to the nuclear holocaust is gripping and, at the same time, one cannot but appreciate the refined Kubrick irony in portraying the characters: Sellers, in a triple role played with his usual elegance; Scott and Hayden as two generals who only differ as to degree of paranoia; and all others. I even found in this CD the song ""We'll Meet Again"", in Vera Lynn's performance: it begins kind of sirupy as the original version was, but it eventually changes to the somewhat jazzed-up one heard at the end of the movie. It brought back memories of the war years and of the BBC shortwave broadcasts to Italy we used to listen to in clandestine secrecy.",932860800,,837,4.586666666666667

168728,5,0800141709,"Stanley Kubrick's side-splitting satire of the cold war and nuclear holocaust is truly a one-of-a-kind film that is absolutely brilliant in every respect.  Oddly, this film came out at the same time as the thriller  ""Fail Safe"", and both films are remarkably similar in structure (a B52 wing  approaching Russia thinking that the unthinkable has occured), and both  films are outstanding.
""Dr. Strangelove..."", however, is so brilliantly  conceived and executed that it rivals comparison.  It is perfection  personified.  There is a scene where the `good' doctor (played by Peter  Sellers) is going through his hilarious antics, and visible on the screen  is the actor playing the Soviet ambassador.  Obviously, Sellers was  ad-libbing because this actor cracked up on screen!  Usually Kubrick is  such a perfectionist that I'm surprised this rewarding mistake made it in  the film.
One only has to view the part of the film where General  Ripper's base is being attacked by U.S. forces to see how realistic this  scene was filmed (I doubt one could tell that this wasn't actual battle  footage), which sharply contrasts with the comedic-tone of the film and  adds greatly to its darkness.  Again, perfection.
Between 1 and 10,  this classic gets the highest possible mark!  It is film making at its very  best.  Sadly, the likes of Stanley Kubrick will never be seen again.",931219200,,1374,5.085585585585585

168730,5,0800141709,"My lasting impression of ""Dr. Strangelove"" is, ""This could have really happened!""
Consider that on January 25, 1995, a Russian radar crew mistakenly identified a Norwegian scientific rocket as an  incoming missile.  In Moscow, a signal went out to the nuclear briefcases  which always accompany President Boris Yeltsin and top defense officials.  In addition, urgent radio contact was made with Russian submarine  commanders.
For the record, the Russian government had been notified  several weeks earlier that the launch was coming, but no one told the radar  crew.",926726400,,566,5.436781609195402

Non-conformist to traditional film ideals this deals with the  scariest possibility that those entrusted with power know absolutely  nothing about how to use it.  Except to misuse it.

168732,5,0800141709,"Following the obligatory, too-sober-to-be-true ""this can never really happen"" disclaimer, we are treated to approximately 90 minutes of sheer (though greatly understated) insanity. From General Jack D. Ripper  (Sterling Hayden) ordering a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union for very  personal reasons, to the concluding montage of atomic explosions  accompanied by Vera Lynn singing ""We'll Meet Again,"" we enter a  world where the fate of humanity rests with ineffectual leaders, the  sexually preoccupied, egomaniacs, and madmen (Not much different from  reality, actually.). This is black comedy at its very finest, set in an  atmosphere that is (Dare I say it, in light of Stanley Kubrick's last  movie?) vaguely Nabokovian.
Peter Sellers is magnificent in three roles:  British Captain Lionel Mandrake, who almost saves the world from nuclear  destruction; Adlai Stevenson-like Merkin Muffley, the decent but  ineffectual U.S. President who can't control the insanity surrounding him;  and Strangelove himself, the German genius who can't quite hide his naughty  past, and who has his own plans for the post-nuclear world. As General  ""Buck"" Turgidson, George C. Scott portrays a man more concerned  with glory (A possible precursor to ""Patton?"") than with finding  a sound solution to the real problem. And, of course, one cannot forget  Slim Pickens as bomber pilot Kong, whooping and hollering as he waves his  cowboy hat, suggestively straddling an atomic bomb in the ultimate Freudian  Liebestod.
From sexual obsessions and the eroticization of death (as in  the opening sequence of a fighter plane refueling in midair), to the  immature behavior of people deciding the world's fate (especially the  antics of General Turgidson), to the telling lack of female characters  (with the exception of Turgidson's scantily-clad secretary, who appears  briefly and whom Turgidson urges to, ""Say your prayers.""),  ""Dr. Strangelove"" packs more interest into ninety minutes than  many over-extended films with lots of pyrotechnics and explosions.
Of  course, we cannot forget Kubrick's direction. He uses all the tricks:  intricate detailing, the play of chiaroscuoro, bizarre camera angles, the  use of music, etc., etc. And I cannot imagine it in anything but black and  white (So hands off, Ted!). Although the American Film Insititute ranked it  Number 26, I would at least place it somewhere in the Top 10, over some of  the other films that ranked higher for what (I believe) may be sentimental  reasons. This is a film where one of our greatest directors found his  voice. And what a voice (or eye) it was!",923788800,26,2611,5.334152334152334

This film was amazing accurate for its time, as Daniel Ellsberg attests in his recent book on ""The Doomsday Machine"".  Today some of the technology has been updated. Yet the basic dilemma remains: empowering low-level officers, or automatic technology (""doomsday machine""), to lauch a nuclear counter-attack (in case normal command and control structure has been destroye) opens the door to an unintended nuclear attack by a rogue officer (General Ripper in the film), or misbehaving technology, or simple ignorance and misinterpretation (as in the Cuban missle crisis). Since the consequences of a large attack include fallout, fire storms, and nuclear winter, the result could be the end of humanity, possibly even of most higher forms of life.
