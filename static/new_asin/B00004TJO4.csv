1351449,5,B00004TJO4,"Based on a short story about Feathertop, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, shows a straw man dreaming to be a real human in order to help his love-interest, Polly, to get back her 52 coins. If you can get past the modernized adaptation of the dance moves, then it will be the perfect movie for those that love animated movies. Though we can predict what happens, the film has great twists. (Maybe 5% on the cheesy side.) Perhaps the main message blinds the dreamer about putting love above everything else will reward you with a happy ending, and that is the only flaw the film has. A final note: the scary parts are not too scary, so this is a great movie for family with young children. Oh! One more tid-bit! Great music for musical shows fanatics!",1085356800,3,740,4.488888888888889
1351450,4,B00004TJO4,"The six-year-old I was baby sitting loved this movie.  By the end, I too, was hoping everything would turn out OK!  It's defiantly geared toward young children, but it makes a good family movie.  When a scarecrow falls in love with a serving girl, Polly, he decides to do everything in his power to help her escape the clutches of the evil Count Grisham.  I enjoyed it, although characters (living in the colonies) make some references to modern day, such as 'cool,' and 'jiving hip-hop trash.'  The kids probably won't mind though.",1085356800,3,532,4.739130434782608

7922906,3,B00004TJO4,"If you have a liking for corny straight-to-video kids' movies, you might just get a kick out of this one. Produced by Warner Bros., it borrows a lot of tropes from Disney including ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""Pinocchio"". (The leading lady even looks a lot like Belle.) But with that said it's not without its charming moments, and as much as there are a lot of annoying side characters even they have some heartwarming scenes or lines. Its biggest problem is the fact that the story is centered around dancing, and the dance scenes are all just rotoscoping of basic dance moves. (I don't mind rotoscoping, but couldn't they use footage of far more impressive dance steps?) A big reason I wanted to see this movie was because I have an affinity for scarecrows and rag dolls, and while I'm not too crazy about the titular character's design he does have a certain charm and likability that does make me hope he wins in the end. The film is definitely an acquired taste. Again, if you get some enjoyability out of goofy Disney knock-offs, you'll probably like this. The nonsensical parts are undoubtedly the most fun.",1448236800,,1125,4.686868686868687
7922907,5,B00004TJO4,I've watched this movie for years! I'm almost 21 now and it's still one of my favorite childhood movies! I wish it were on DVD!!!!,1445126400,,130,4.24
7922908,5,B00004TJO4,Bought as a gift.  It is a great movie.  Too bad it isn't available on dvd.,1439769600,,75,3.625
7922909,3,B00004TJO4,"I remember this was on Cartoon Network years ago and as a lover for animated films I decided to give it a go. The movie is based off a play and tells the tale of a scarecrow who comes to life thanks to a magic feather that he keeps in his hat. Of course things get complicated when he falls madly in love with a poor orphan girl named Polly who wants to save up coins so she can leave the place she is staying along with her friends who are children. So of course the scarecrow decides to give Polly the money as an evil ruthless man named Grisham is after it and he decides to give Polly back her money.but he gets caught and he does a runner. So his fairy godmother appears and he wishes to become human and voila he becomes human. But there is a catch you see as he has to wear this magical feather that makes him look human in order not to show his real self and he has to avoid mirrors as the human guise is just a illusion. Problems arise however as Polly falls for Feathertop(who is the name of the scarecrow now btw and let me say he looks like Dimitri from Anastasia meets Aladdin in human form)as he helps her win the money back thanks to a dance contest. But will the spell last so he can remain human.

Honestly this film is very very stupid but having said that I kinda like this movie. Its no masterpiece by all means but what I liked about it was the animation was nice and I actually felt sorry for Scarcrow as he wanted to be with Polly. (Yeah i'm feeling like this movie is all about an inanimated object who's got a thing for a non inanimated object). If you can forgive one or two scenes that may leave you cringeworthy,I'd say go check it out.",1431302400,,1664,4.08868501529052

7922914,5,B00004TJO4,"The Scarecrow, though very cheesy at times, is  one of the best animated movies. My favorite part, would have to be the reoccuring DANCE theme throughout the movie. The best part has to be the dance sequence featuring the scarecrow at the beginning of the movie.

 This movie can be enjoyed by people of all ages, though you might not think so at first glance. I am a teenager, and I love it for the absurd story line, if not the cheese factor, as do my friends, and some are older than me.

 How can you not love a movie where one of the main characters utters the cheesy yet hilarious line:

""Sorry I'm late again, there's just so darn much to do in this neat world!""",1133136000,3,669,4.228346456692913
7922915,5,B00004TJO4,"This film is an absoloubtely amazing cartoon film. Let me start by saying that I am suprised this is not a film created by the great of cartoon films, Walt Disney.

It has everything a childrens' cartoon should have, magical situations, evil figures, a beautiful maiden. It has some great musical numbers, as well as the smoothness in the characters' movement is very well done.

The only bad part is that not enough format's have been brought into production, due to the fact I wish to own this, although I live in england, and the only format it is in is NTSE VHS. So the only thing I have to add is that if it was brought onto DVD format I would buy it in a snap.",1108598400,3,666,4.2362204724409445
