Thankfully, this is a terrific release for English-speaking audiences. Not only is the movie fully subtitled (with GOOD subs!), but even the menu displays in English. And the subs are much better designed than Sentai Filmworks did for the US release of the tv series, so that's a big help too.

The movie itself is great, as well. It really brings to life those final two volumes of the manga. There are slight changes made, of course, but those alterations from the manga work well for the anime.

Definitely 5 of 5 stars. Love it!",1462147200,,667,4.6440677966101696
8543244,5,B009NSKHB2,"This movie was really well made and does an excellent job of concluding loose ends from the television series.  I think fans of the franchise will be happy with it.  This Japanese Blu-ray is a region A or region free release, because I had no trouble playing it, and comes with the bonus of having English subtitles, so it will play on North American players and be understandable to English audiences.  I recommend watching this film only if you have seen the corresponding series first otherwise you may be a little lost though.",1406073600,2,530,4.67741935483871
