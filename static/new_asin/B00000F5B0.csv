1207896,5,B00000F5B0,This is a movie that I saw in the theater when it came out.  Dennis Quaid is sexy and talented and Kristy McNichol was so sweet and innocent.  I loved this movie then and I love it now.  I would love to get my hands on a CD of just the music.  It brings tears and laughter and frustration all together in a way that makes it worth the time and attention it takes to watch it.,1125014400,4,375,3.831168831168831
1207897,5,B00000F5B0,"this movie is a wonderful film. i loved this movie so much that i even named my daughter amanda.

please beware of the cheap copies that are sold on ebay. unfortately, i was one of those people that did buy one.you can definately tell the difference in quality. i wish that i would have seen the review from BEWARE before.

i really wish that this movie was on dvd. the picture quality i think would be great!",1120953600,4,409,4.298701298701299
1207898,5,B00000F5B0,"I was obsessed with Kristy McNichol as a kid. At 37, I have found old obsessions die hard. I loved this movie when it was released in 1981, but I wasn't quite so sure it would still hold my attention in 2004. I recently purchased one of those VHS transfers to DVD and I am surprised to find this movie still as captivating today as I did when I was a kid. The thing I am most surprised by is how entertaining it is.

It is a total B movie, but it's incredibly rich in its character development, or maybe that is just the acting, which is great. The editing is really amazing too; there are a lot of subtleties to this and a lot of sensitivity and I find that really surprising, when most media today is so flat, crude and one-dimensional. It is easy to tell that that this film was made by some very talented people. And I have to say, in all honesty, I really think that Kristy McNichol and Dennis Quaid can sing. This is just all-around wonderful entertainment.

I hope this gets an offical DVD release sometime soon. But until then I will just enjoy my Ebay counterfit.",1096675200,35,1072,4.25

1207973,1,B00000F5B0,"I didn't realize this was a bootleg fake until I looked at the homemade case. ""Inspired by the song by Reba McIntyre (sic)!"" First, the movie came out in 1981 and Reba McEntire covered the old 1969 Bobbie Gentry tune in 1991. They could have at least spelled Reba's last name correctly! The DVD itself is burned and printed on a home machine - Look at the low print quality, Once you play the DVD itself the recording quality is simply atrocious. I stopped the DVD two minutes into it. I will not have a bootleg product in my home so it's going back. It's too bad - I remember watching the movie when I was in high school and I had high hopes.",1422316800,,643,4.193548387096774

Second they misspelled Reba's last name it is McEntire.

Interesting to see Mark Hammill in a post-Luke-Skywalker role. His star never rose as high after Star Wars. Good music and Quaid is a surprisingly decent singer.

1208133,1,B00000F5B0,"I couldn't wait to receive the dvd in the mail.  Ripped open the packaging and popped it into the dvd player and was immediately let down.

This is most likely a counterfeit item because the picture quality is poor.  The picture is grainy and fuzzy and the audio is mediocre at best.  It was either made by copying with a camera from the screen or from an internet rip.

No way this was made from a master of the movie.  The disk has an inkjet label stuck onto a DVD and the artwork on the box is cheap and amateurish and looks like a 3 color xerox

As for the movie itself: although I'm not a fan of country music, I enjoyed several of the songs -- they might be described as country rock.

Saving the best for last, Kristy McNichol is so-o-o cute! She deserved an Oscar just for the way she says ""Nashville, beware."" -- and there's something for everyone: the ladies will go for Dennis Quaid.",1246492800,,585,4.3577981651376145

1208249,5,B00000F5B0,"This is a great, often forgotten movie from 1981, a time when roots/southern themes were hot in movies, what with Urban Cowboy, Honeysuckle Rose, and this little gem all hailing from around the same time. Unlike Urban and Honeysuckle, though, this movie has not been offically rereleased on DVD. Like another review said, it appears to be a bootleg--nothing but a transfer from a VHS tape. While the quality is passable--at least the picture is as good as VHS's get--the audio is obviously a little muffled and significantly lower in quality than Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1. And that is a shame, because the music in this movie is FANTASTIC! While the acting is good overall, as for the singing, Dennis Quaid is pretty good, but Kristy McNichol is clearly an amateur. She has a decent voice, but she could have used more experience as a singer before tackling a role as a singer in a movie. Still, the songs that Quaid and McNichol sing are great tunes! As is the case with many movie soundtracks--and it's really annoying--some of the best songs in this movie are not on the soundtrack album (should you be able to find it, anyway).

This movie is funny and entertaining, and the music is great! So despite the low picture/audio quality, I still recommend it highly!",1203897600,2,1265,4.698198198198198
1208250,4,B00000F5B0,"I love this movie and I have read other peoples reviews that talks about the poor quality of the DVD, but I own the VHS and it was not the best quality either! I really love this movie and would like to see it remastered, but until then this DVD is not to bad! Take that for what it is worth! I found the seller to be fast delivery and the movie is great!",1201478400,,355,3.810810810810811
1208251,5,B00000F5B0,I had wanted to get this movie for my very own ever since I first saw it on television! It made my week when I was able to finally GET one! I treasure it because of the really fun story as well as the singing! It really made it a GOLD MINE to have a movie that features Kristy SINGING! She should've done MORE of that!,1201219200,,318,3.8333333333333335
1208252,2,B00000F5B0,"This DVD release by Newstar is all over the internet. It says inspired by Reba's version of the GA song but she had not even recoreded it yet when the movie was first released.... it was actually Vicki Lawrence. The obvious VHS transfer is dark and blurry. So mnay of us have complained but it is the only way to see this great film, unless you own one of the old VHS copies that are getting harder to find. I bought a new import copy of this film and was shocked how good it looked... no blurry pic, no darkness in the bar scenes.... great menus! Just wanted to let anyone looking for something much improved for less money, it's available at 70s-tv.com. Until the real thing shows up... I am VERY HAPPY to see the full picture in vivid color and detail.",1196985600,4,755,4.286713286713287

1208256,5,B00000F5B0,"I really hope that this movie is put into dvd form soon.  I think this was Dennis Quaid's first movie or was it Caveman? Anyway he is really talented and I always liked Kristy McNichol since the show ""Family"", which also starred James Broderick (Matthew's father). She has the charm of a little waif and who could forget Mark Hamil from Star Wars fame.  Please bring this movie out soon.

A Fan",1140220800,15,394,4.444444444444445
1208257,5,B00000F5B0,"I have been waiting for years for you to put this on DVD legitimately.  I know sometimes you can find this on Ebay on DVD.  But I am not sure I trust those copies.  PLEASE work with me on this and put this out.  I had the VHS but can't find it anywhere.  This movie makes me think of my close relationship to my brother.  It is sentimental to me and I LOVE the movie.

I will definately purchase it when it comes out!  I would also be interested in the series ""FAMILY"" on DVD.

Thank you,

Angie",1133568000,6,495,3.9591836734693877

I will say she's a much better actor than singer/performer. And it was funny to see a very young Dennis Quaid and Mark Hamill.",1466208000,4,286,4.125
