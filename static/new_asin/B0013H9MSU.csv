I have watched it so many times but it never gets old,  just good clean entertainment which is soooooo refreshing. I wonder why it has not been made compatible to USA players ? I found it on Amazon prime but nowhere else.",1436400000,,296,4.157894736842105
8250966,5,B0013H9MSU,"As a child I remember seeing the original 50s version of this movie, though I don't recall many details. When I was raising my children this remake was marketed by a now-defunct family film company in VHS format. It was a favorite.

The story is interesting, the acting is good and it is family friendly. The little boys who come to live with their grandfather are so endearing and the baby they find and try to take care of without others knowing is so sweet. But it isn't all just sweetness. There is plenty of conflict within the home and with the neighbors, along with a gentle thread of romance. It has something for everyone.

Over the years I have purchased several copies of the VHS in secondhand stores and given them to friends and family. I had my VHS copy converted to DVD a year ago.

Though I don't like their marketing tactics, I appreciate that Feature Films for Families has recently picked up this movie and offers it in DVD format for the U.S. market. As of this writing it listed at $12.95. Once you get on their list, however, you can't shake them and I would actually look for their DVD from an Amazon marketplace seller and pay a little more before giving my info to them.",1268870400,,1195,4.422727272727273
8250967,5,B0013H9MSU,"A Canadian-American production (CBC-Disney), set in Nova Scotia in 1903, this film features two utterly charming lads (Harry, 8 and Davy, 6), at ease before the camera, and who steal the show from Charlton Heston, the titular star.

The Boer War has been over a handful of years, Harry and Davy's father has been killed in the Boer War and their mother has died. They are sent by relatives in England to live with their Scots grandparents in Canada (Heston, Patricia Gage). Grandfather is deeply prejudiced against the Boer family who lives in the village, holding them responsible in the death of his son. A complicating factor is that Heston's daughter is in love with the Boer son. The effects of the prejudice on the immediate family and on the lads is the core of the story and leads to the incident suggested by the title.

This is a re-working of the original 1953 story. I haven't seen that one, so cannot compare the two. But this one is an all-around family film -- no swearing, sexual references, or violence -- but it's not flat and lifeless.

I rented it from Amazon Video On Demand for $1.99.",1266796800,,1106,4.604060913705584
8250968,5,B0013H9MSU,"I love this movie.  If we could get it in US formate, I would love it.  I tried to copy my vhs version (copied from a friend's copy - which was copied from the tv.)  It got erased when trying to copy it to a DVD.  PLEASE, SOMEONE, HAVE IT FORMATED FOR THE USA AND CANADIAN AUDIENCE, I SO WANT A COPY!! Have them put it on Amazon.com.

I love the music (great old dances from that period), story line, romance - great family movie.",1217980800,3,430,4.011764705882353
8250969,5,B0013H9MSU,"I saw this film years ago and was delighted with it, although I cannot claim to be a Charlton Heston fan.  It's the sweet story of two little boys who have lost their parents to war and are sent to live with their unforgiving and harsh grandfather.  There's a lovely story concerning their aunt (their father's sister, who continues to live at home under the thumb of her domineering and rigid father) whose sweetness and kindness attracts the attention of a compassionate country doctor (well-played by a very young Bruce Greenwood - he's so fantastic with accents).  It's an alls-well-that-ends-well story, but well worth the telling ... and the viewing!  I would dearly love to see this released in DVD to share with my grandkids.",1212364800,4,733,4.84
