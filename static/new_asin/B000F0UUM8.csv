8116087,4,B000F0UUM8,"When you see Tim Holt's name on the cover, you more or less know that the movie is a B-Western, but I found this one quite satisfactory.  Holt plays Dave Jordan, a cowboy who, with his partner Chito Jose Gonzalez Bustamente Rafferty (Richard Martin), has thrown in with Pop Melhorn (Jason Robards) and his daughter Sue (Nan Leslie) to search for Panguitch, a legendary black mustang stallion with whose capture Pop has long been obsessed.  Though they don't catch the stallion himself, they do contrive to round up his herd, and there their troubles begin.  The only buyer with money enough to take the whole herd is Jay Olmstead (Harry Woods), whom Pop neither likes nor trusts--and with good reason, for having signed a bill of sale Pop is murdered and robbed by Olmstead, who then tries to claim the herd.  Sue and Dave naturally won't let him, and Dave sets out to find out exactly what happened to Pop and the money.  Meanwhile Hod Slack (Richard Powers), a disgruntled member of the horse-hunting expedition, inadvertantly witnesses the crime and decides to blackmail Olmstead.  Eventually the latter is also killed and Dave is accused of it, forcing Chito to break him out of jail so they can learn the truth.  As you can see, this is a far more convoluted plot than is usually found in B's, yet it's all resolved in the typical 60-minute playing time.  What's more, all the exteriors *are* exteriors, and the harsh desert scenery makes a great backdrop for the action.  As an introduction to the Zane Grey Western Classics series, this is definitely better quality than I expected.",1295568000,7,1589,4.7700729927007295

At the peak of his career in the 1940's ""B"" westerns, he was the ""fastest draw"" in the movies with the ability to draw his revolver in five frames of film (slightly over one sixth of a second) ... From 1941-43 and 1948-52 Tim Holt was a top ten box office star ... Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1991.
