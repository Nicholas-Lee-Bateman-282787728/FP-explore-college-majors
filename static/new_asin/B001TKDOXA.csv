8448023,5,B001TKDOXA,"This is basically a country blues with Albert Lee licks in the key of A.  These are great licks to help you learn this style. He gives you the licks in context and is chord on chord playing which is a jazz technique and is melodic.  I would recommend this for every guitar style, however these are intermediate level licks so you will need good technique. Please listen to Brent Mason because he can smoke on these kind of licks.",1380672000,2,429,4.35
