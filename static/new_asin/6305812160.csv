1083621,5,6305812160,Paul and Robbie Benson. Benson made quite a few movies when he was young. He has grown older and has had a lot of physical problems. You need this in your collection.,1447718400,,166,4.21875

1083625,3,6305812160,"Having enjoyed watching the movie years ago, I picked up the Blu-ray when it came out.  Paul Newman plays Harry Keach, a father whose cinematic, playful wrecking-ball operator career is over and who can't bring himself to take a lesser position.  Robbie Benson plays his son Howard, an aspiring - but as-yet unsuccessful writer - who does car detailing for a little money and surfing for more fun and shows a lot of skin.  Harry tells Howard to get a ""real"" job instead.  Each has friends and relatives willing to help out.  Howard has an ex-girlfriend with a big problem.  Harry shuts down.  Howard opens up.  The need to seek and step up to opportunities in difficult times is the main theme.

One gets to see Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward working together.  Morgan Freeman plays a supervisor in a box factory in which Howard tries to work.  Ossie Davis's character owns a truck Howard is supposed to repossess.  Ellen Barkin gets to play Howard's ex-girlfriend.  There is a lot of talent in the supporting cast.

The Blu-ray picture and sound are very good.  In addition to the film itself, the only extras are the still photos on the jacket and the opportunity to choose between eight chapters.  Although IMDB shows the film at 120 minutes, the actual timing agrees with the film case at 117 minutes.  I noticed nothing missing.

""Harry & Son"" makes a worthwhile bargain Blu-ray entertainment.  See Paul Newman tear down buildings and Robbie Benson surf and type too!",1432598400,4,1473,4.75098814229249

1083744,5,6305812160,Paul Newman and Robbie Benson are great actors. I saw this movie a few yrs. ago then found it on instant videos recently. I bought it for my library and watched it 3 times that same day. Beautiful story line and acting. Recommend this to anyone that loves these actors. Also Joanne Woodward did a beautiful job. Love it!!,1382572800,4,321,4.4576271186440675
1083745,5,6305812160,I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time. Was happy to have found it for such a great price. Fast shipping and easy transaction.,1367971200,,139,4.185185185185185
1083746,5,6305812160,"If you like Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward then you will like this film.
Their on screen chemistry is just right.
The relationship between Newman and Benson as his son is wonderfully acted.
It's not an academy award winning film granted but I so cherished trying to understand Newman's character and watch him and Benson interact.",1363651200,5,331,4.928571428571429
1083747,3,6305812160,"I didn't watch it, I bought it for my nephew, it had something to do with his relationship with his father who had passed away, now the nephew has also passed away, he enjoyed the movie.thanks.",1353024000,,193,4.388888888888889
1083748,5,6305812160,"I first saw this movie about 35 years ago, loved it then, and love it now.  This is a highly underrated performance in the Paul Newman canon.  Newman and Joane Woodward are excellent in the roles of old friends seguing into a loving relationship as a result of  much prodding (meddling?) by Robby Benson, who likewise is outstanding in his role as Newman's independent thinking, but immature son.  Great in supporting roles are Morgan Freeman, Ossie Davis, and Ellen Barkin who round out an excellent cast.  I have noted that others did not neccessarily care for the story line, but conversely I found the duel coming of age stories of father and son true to life, with an excellent mixture of pain and humor.  If you just want a feel good movie without the intrusion of death and a lived happily ever after ending, then this may not be the flick for you, however if you value a well crafted story that emphasizes important life lessons with a somewhat subtle delivery, this one will not disapoint.",1322352000,2,998,4.642045454545454
1083749,5,6305812160,This is a great movie.  Paul Newman is always refreshing to watch.  He was such a credible actor.  I loved this movie.,1297123200,,118,4.2727272727272725
1083750,3,6305812160,"Sometimes because you can make a movie, doesn't mean that you should?
Paul Newman directed this movie and the acting is and actors are all pretty good: the plot material is just pretty dreadful.
A father and son living together after the mother dies are just kind of
lost in life. During the movie some things get better but most get worse
so that the overall picture isn't a happy one,
if realistic.",1245715200,,400,4.493150684931507
1083751,5,6305812160,"it's all about father and son relationship.  I watched it simply because I love both, Paul Newman and Robby Benson but I was totally captured by the story, even if it started a little slowly at times.  Benson plays his role SUPERBLY -  he is a free spirit, true to himself and exuberant young guy who loves his father (Newman)to death and tries his best to please and cheer him and finally, towards the end of the film, succeeds with the father beginning to recognize his son's talent and human qualities and showing appreciation to his son. It is a slice of life, wonderfully played by actors I love.  I am adding this DVD to my collection.",1243296000,8,641,4.452991452991453
7896428,5,6305812160,this is a good movie and it's so sad,1501459200,,36,3.111111111111111
7896429,4,6305812160,"Give me Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman and boy, do I love Robby Benson. What a wonderful movie and it is all pure story. Paul is a widowed dad and he lives with his son, Robby Benson who is purely a very sensitive artsy guy and dad would like him to grow up and get a job other than the auto detailing he is doing. Robby meets and falls in love with an already pregnant girl (shocking! 1984) This is really of story of the relationship between a father and son, and Joanne Woodward as Paul Newman's wife's sister. This is a nice story with very nice performances but of course dad can be a little overwhelming at times and not much in the way of bending. His way or no way. I always loved Robby Benson's very laid back style of acting and it has always worked for him.",1495584000,,769,4.133333333333334

7896435,4,6305812160,"Good , not great performances by all. This and an admirable storyline and good optimism in spite of the challenges encountered...makes for a good 70's piece. A real bright spot is the adorable Ellen Barkin as a pregnant teen.",1476230400,,225,4.794871794871795
7896436,3,6305812160,"Even though Paul Newman is one of my favorite actors of all time, I had a hard time liking the story. Newman's performance was good, as always. So was Joanne Woodwards, as always. Bobby Benson really empressed me. Excellent actor. It was the story, I guess, that just didn't do it for me.",1469318400,2,288,4.452830188679245
