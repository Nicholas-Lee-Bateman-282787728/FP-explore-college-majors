2264535,4,B00094ARXC,"A zombie film, yes, but do not expect a traditional zombie experience when viewing They Came Back.  These zombies do not seek to gorge human flesh, or to frighten the audience.  Instead the director Robin Campillo delivers a cerebrally stimulating narration of the return of the dead in his directorial dbut.  Before making this non-traditional zombie film Campillo co-wrote and edited Laurent Cantet's memorable Time Out (2001), which offered a thoughtful tale of a laid-off office worker that takes his destiny in his own hands.  There are stronger similarities between Time Out and They Came Back than between this zombie film and any of the more traditional zombie films such as Night of the Living Dead (1968).

Without delay the audience is informed about the sudden return of more than 70 million people, and approximately 13,000 have come back from the dead in the town in which the story takes place.  These people who have returned have passed away within the last ten years, which means that there are many familiar faces among the returnees.  They all wear light colored clothing and seem to be in excellent condition.  This means that they will not have the familiar zombie look with decaying body parts or the peculiar gangly movement.  Nothing seems to be different between them and the living with the exception of a blank and confused look on their faces.

In order to handle this sudden return of the vast number of people the authorities have taken control of most community Centers and warehouses in order to house the newly emerged population.  The line of reasoning is based on identification of the returnees and to study them in more detail.  In the order families discover their once lost family members the returnees can return to their old homes.  However, many remain for a prolonged time in these temporary community shelters due to many various personal reasons.  Nonetheless, it is evident that the people who have come back from the dead will cause additional problems to the living in several different ways.

Campillo's zombie film turns into a philosophical tale that illustrates the tangible question of what if people came back from the dead and populated earth.  A wide range of notions are addressed throughout the film such as over-population, unemployment, governmental expenses, and much more.  In the backdrop of political issues, the story reveals how it influences macrosociety.  To further Campillo's visual manifestation of politics it could suggest an intangible concept that the human race might not be far from these issues when observing the world and its unyielding population increase.

The film also goes into great depth of how the return of deceased family member would influence the family and the individual.  This view of a microsociety is delivered through three different marriages where the couples are of various ages.  One family deals with the return of their dead son while the other two deal with the return of a spouse either male and female.  Under close scrutiny the emotional impact seems to be emphasized on the family level.  Here the viewer can experience the psychological aftermath of enduring bereavement to have these old psychological scars once again torn up.  The psychological stress is not to be underestimated in a situation such as They Came Back offers, which displays an extensive array of emotional characteristics.

A vast sense of stress and anxiety rests within the film, but it never tips over when it feels overwhelming. The cast performs terrifically where they deliver genuine emotions such as confusion and a subtle apprehensive tension.  The camerawork and lighting bind together the cast performances into a thick fabric where both the society and the family unit merge in an unsympathetic atmosphere where facts rule.  Amidst this seemingly strong society the individual's are adrift in a disorientated emotional state while blindly reaching out for anything that could help them.  All of the complexities within They Came Back offer a unique cinematic experience that encourages much philosophical contemplative work.  Unfortunately, at times the film feels a little too cerebral which causes some scenes to suffer from mental congestion.",1121040000,30,4238,5.154970760233918
2264536,3,B00094ARXC,"This is NOT a horror movie. Neither is it really a zombie flick. It could have worked as an existentialist study but in the end it doesn't quite amount to that either.

It helps somewhat to point out that this was made in France. The French always seem to have an odd way of looking at things. Its original title was ""Les Revenants"" (The Returnees/The Ghosts). The basic premise is that of your typical zombie flick. Seventy million recently deceased have arisen from graves around the world. Several thousand of them are to be found in the little French town we are concerned with. These are not your typical zombies with rotting flesh and decaying clothes. They all look fresh and lively and dressed as if they were going out on a Sunday picnic. They don't appear to have any ill intent. In fact they look quite pitiable. The majority are elderly and frail. The reaction of the townsfolk is also not one of terror like in most zombie flicks, but of pragmatism - how to reintegrate them into society. I liked how the producers took this rather novel approach to the movie. The director also stated how he wanted to produce a movie exploring the process of mourning. This too would have been a fertile field to plough. However it never really seems to pan out.

We get to see how society, specifically the French bureaucracy, handles the Returnees. It is all done with cool governmental efficiency, much like any other refugee resettlement problem. Scientific studies are made which reveal that the Returnees are not like real human beings after all. They are both mentally and physically sluggish. They have low body temperatures but enhanced immunity to infections. They do not sleep and get agitated at night, wandering aimlessly for miles only to be brought back to government shelters the next morning. Pharmaceutical companies quickly develop medications to placate them. As some of them cannot function in their former jobs, they have to be retrained at a lower capacity. I thought the societal angle was very well done. The personal angle less so. The film could have explored more clearly how the living come to terms with the return of loved ones they have long given up for dead. Unfortunately it doesn't do that. Neither does it explore to any great depth the themes of loss and bereavement. It had so many possibilities. Most were just skimmed over. Instead it reverted to a standard clich of almost all zombie movies - all zombies turn bad in the end and they can only be defeated with violence. ""Les Revenants"" began with an intriguing idea and novel approach that whetted the appetite but the development and ending was a letdown.

Wellspring has provided a fine transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic). Picture quality is clean, clear and sharp with bright vibrant colors, good black levels and good shadow detail, essential in a movie with lots of dark scenes. Sound is in the original French 2.0 stereo or a Dolby 5.1 remix. Optional English subtitles are provided. There is an interesting 20 minute ""Making Of"" featurette, cast filmographies, the theatrical trailer and four other trailers of Wellspring releases. Personally I found the movie disappointing. You should probably rent it first before deciding whether you want a copy.",1120953600,19,3277,4.869175627240144

2264587,3,B00094ARXC,"Les Revenants
A thematic current has been playing itself out over the last decade.  It is the walking dead.  There is at one end of the spectrum, of course, the wonderful zombie soap opera of the same name that is so hot it has its own after show and a slew of games.  On the other end of the spectrum is the cerebral zombie.  These zombies typically have no hunger which eliminates the need for intestine and brain eating scenes.  While the Caesar Romero film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" inspired the Kirkman comic book, pardon me, graphic novel, it was the French, Les Revenants that started the cerebral zombie phenomenon.  Since its debut in 2004 there has been the wildly successful 2012 French series, The Returned which was optioned by Sundance and is truly one of the most unusual, unique, engaging series I have ever seen on the home screen.  ABC is presently airing Resurrected and has officially sprung for a second year.

Les Revenants opens with thousands of folks leaving a cemetery looking freshly shaved, coiffed and neatly dressed.  Its as if their blood had never been drained and replaced with bubble gum colored embalming solutions not to mention characters free of the broken necks and shattered bodies that accompanied their deaths in the first place.

The Returned takes the creepy Twin Peaks style which works for its more localized phenomenon rather than a global one.  Outside of the small rural town in which the action plays death goes on as usual.  Les Revenants opens with thousands of people leaving the cemetery in broad daylight and heading into town.  Initially, Les Revenants shows us these returned folks as almost normal, just a bit slow and out of synch.  They are returned to society and to old jobs and lives with folks who have already grieved their demise and have psychologically and emotionally moved on with their lives.  Yup, people are complicated, especially dead ones.  Apparently there are 70 million worldwide.  But were in a small town in rural France, St. Somethingorother.  They don't like to sleep and they like to wander at night.

Considering most are elderly and retired this creates a problem.  And the fact that they have no appetites makes dinners awkward.  But they can still make whoopee in spite of being 5 degrees cooler and impervious to infection.  Its France so there are discussions about the need to repatriate these workers and luckily for France they have a government that steps up.  In the Republican wet dream version in the USA, one can only imagine that particular discussion centering on why anyone should pay their dead workers when theyll obviously work for free. But this is France so when they send up the balloons with the thermal cameras to watch their interesting movements at night, herd mentaility, we discover that the French word for Big Brother is Beeg Bro-thare.

The film does a good job of building suspense and suppressing the oh come on level of disbelief.  Youd think one might be curious about how they got out of their coffins considering all the graves are still intact.  Youd think the burning question is whats on the other side.  But the only child that asks her new and improved grandma that question is shushed by her mother.  Oh come on, youd  think everyone wants to know that.  And God love em, the French can film a pregnant pause better than most which makes the love scene between reunited lovers the perfect segue to the first meeting where scientists are beginning their quantitative and qualitative studies on Les Revenants.

We see them meeting at night and then a bit of mayhem as Les Revenants just up and go.  They descend into pipes below the ground to do what who knows.  No questions are asked and none are answered.  I suspect the same will be true of tonights season finale of Resurrection.  And yet I will watch that too.

2264593,5,B00094ARXC,"I love Les Revenants.  I love the debate that surrounds this film.  What IS it all about?  The dead of a small town in France up and walk out of the local cemetery one day, expecting to return to their lives.  Naturally  the people of the town are wary of their returned loved ones.  Some families welcome their revenants back, others react in extreme ways.  When the revenants began meeting at night, of course the townsfolk think they're Planning Something... It only gets better.

Some people believe that the town in Les Revenants is Purgatory.  Others take the literal approach. *I* think Les Revenants is simply the best, most haunting zombie movie I've ever seen.

2264618,1,B00094ARXC,"Movie is slow, boring, and cryptic.
There is no resolutions, no revelations, and absolutely nothing interesting happens at all.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This is not a zombie move; this is a ""resurrection"" movie. With no explanation, 70 million recently dead appear alive on earth. (dead 10 years or less) They are in good physical health though mentally vacant - being only able to mimic the living and are unable to learn new things.

There is a long and boring social studies lesson on how to unsuccessfully integrate the recently undead into society. Those returned to their old jobs are eventually downgraded to menial labor. Those returned to their families are unable or unwilling to assimilate. Of course, some families do not want their undead relatives returned.

When left to their own devices the undead roam aimlessly for miles and hold clandestine meetings at night.

There are three main story lines: Eldery woman is returned to her husband, she constantly tries to leave and he wants her to stay. A boy is returned to his mom and dad; dad accepts him and the mom does not. An undead man follows his wife back to their home, at first she isn't sure she wants him back.

FINALE:
One night the undead set off a series of explosions for absolutely no reason at all. Then they climb down into the sewers never to be seen again. A few undead are gassed into comas to prevent them from going into the tunnels. The next day those people are then laid to rest on their graves where they gradually fade away.",1388534400,2,1531,4.651851851851852

I agree 100% with the OP who touched on the many ideas and conflicts this movie didn't explore and I think that each of these (and more) would make for excellent episodes of the television series. I have yet to watch that version, though I doubt that the writers were as clever as to have done this! In any event, I did like that we do not know what happened, we experience it as the characters did, and I think any explanation would have been, at best, unsatisfactory. More importantly, it would have distracted us from the what this story is about. To me, anyway, this was more of a metaphysical/existential film meant to be contemplated: what is life? what is death? what makes us human? what defines a person? what makes our lives meaningful? how do we feel about these things? The tone is a somber one and the story which advances these questions doesn't stray and lose focus in order to flesh out the many aspects of the dead returning to our world, rather, it keeps it simple with the practical and mundane. They come back, make us think, then they go.

So, in summary, it's a French film, lol.",1357603200,,1324,4.4

Instead, we are treated to a thought-provoking treatise into human understanding and condition when the laws of Life and Death are literally turned upside down. How would you react if a loved one who had passed away, mysteriously returned, looking like their old self but demonstrably different in personality and character... a near vacant shadow of their former self? Would society embrace the returned or question their motives? Many Zombiephiles claim the movie is too slow, lacking the typical gore and relentless graphic violence associated with such Z-films, but They Came Back's mood and pacing is made deliberate, like an eerie surreal dream or waking nightmare, which slowly builds up in tension and haunts its way into the very marrow of your soul... unnerving like an icy chill.

Then it all fell apart in the last act. If only we had known the recently departed were secret terrorists who could withstand multi-story freefalls without a single broken bone (what other superpowers were the intrepid scientists and armies of Red Cross volunteers unable to detect?).

2264659,5,B00094ARXC,"Whether the creators of this film intended it or not, I found it to be a very compelling and emotional allegory about autism. The behavior and characteristics of the ""returned"" (absolutely not ""zombies"") is incredibly similar to that of autistic individuals. Especially Sylvaine (the child)--the social detachedness, emotional aloofness, repetitive banging, ""mimicking"" of proper responses and behavior (explicitly pointed out by the film's doctor), the trouble sleeping, and the MEDICATION--and the way in which the family members respond: the frustration, the heartache, the exasperation, the marital stress--all of this was so well portrayed ... and so very similar to what one deals with in autism. What, indeed, is society to do with such people--provide for their needs SEPARATELY (i.e., separate housing, care, etc.) or keep them IN THE HOME as part of the family, despite the many and ongoing struggles? Wow, what an amazing and ingenious way of allegorically casting a central societal issue of today--and in such a way as to (hopefully) stimulate serious thought about it. The ending, moreover, I thought was very appropriate, considering the point (as I took it): the returnees did not want to ""fit in""--just as autistic individuals do not--and society's narrow-minded approach was to try to force them to do so--even if it meant medicating and restraining them. In the end, the returnees simply made the choice for society--a choice consistent with who they were and what society was implicitly telling them it wanted. In the end, as one character puts it, the friends and family who remain are left wondering if it would have been better had the returnees never returned--THIS is the challenge to the viewer with respect to any socially ""abnormal"" group (autistic or otherwise) ... and a thought that has certainly crossed the minds of parents and family members (though it's hard to admit it) of autistic individuals ... ""Would it have been better had they never arrived ...""",1310947200,5,1989,5.21875
2264660,5,B00094ARXC,"The film opens with a parading mass indicative of a rising.  Their sluggish mannerisms are fairly typical of classic undead cinema, but characteristically they're quite different. Cleanly, almost casually dressed and not at all aggressive, it appears that they've just simply returned.

The reaction following is handled elegantly by authorities and well-chronicled throughout the movie: the reanimated are contained, analyzed, and finally released into the arms of the loved ones willing to take them back.

It's at this point that the movie takes on an unsettling tone.  The idea of losing a lover, friend, or family member is hardly alien to most viewers, so the plot is completely accessible.  The grieving process is excruciating, exhausting.  It's also intrusive.  Your soul has to heal, and in doing so, will often push the severity of a loss somewhere deep where it too can die.

Imagine finally emerging from this process only to have the loved one return alive and seemingly healthy. They look the same, but something's off, as if they've only memorized their past and are playing it back to appease you.

It's an interesting concept and worth your consideration provided you fall under a certain criteria, or lack thereof.  Fans of zombie cinema craving the normalcy of it will most likely be disappointed.  There's no gore and barely enough violence to garner even the most cursory horror nod.

Those approaching with an inclination towards a softer, more layered spin on what has become a worn genre, however, will undoubtedly be satisfied.  The movie instills a dark and moody introspection that I found rewarding.

In the end, I do believe that at its core, this is a deeply disturbing love story brought to you by a country with an acclaimed history of successfully presenting just that.

Enjoy.

2264662,3,B00094ARXC,"This film has English sub-titles and a definite twist.  The zombies are not mean, nasty people eating traditional zombies. Since this is France, there is no blaming God or anything about our sin bringing this onto us which if the U.S. had done this film, it would have.  It was more of a resurrection (as in like Christ) of the people who died within 10 years who rise from the dead rather than a zombie film which is another reason why this is a definite French twist.  THAT religious connotation is radioactive.

That said, They Came Back could have been so much more fleshed out.  They never really explained WHY it happened. Admittedly I nodded off during some of it as parts CRAWLED slowly forward so I may have missed it.  If they did explain, I am NOT subjecting myself to a 2nd viewing to find out.

Was it aliens who possessed the recently dead bodies?

The 3 rating was for the psychological aspects of the living people who have to welcome their dead parent, spouse or child back into their lives.  How do you have sex with a being several degrees cooler than you are even if he is your spouse?

I wondered if the woman got pregnant and WHAT THAT  child would be like.

There could have been so much more done with this film if they hadn't crawled so SLOWLY through it and wasted time.

Still, it gets kudos for original thinking.  The director or other writer/directors can take it to another level with all the new ideas in this film.",1229817600,3,1447,4.431818181818182
2264663,3,B00094ARXC,"Les Revenants (Robin Campillo, 2004)

Man, I really wanted to like this movie. Robin Campillo, the editor on Qui a tue Bambi?, in his first directorial effort, and you gotta love the premise: suddenly, with no warning, everyone who's died within a certain time rises from the dead and comes back to the town where they lived. Not as zombies, really; they're capable of communicating, they want their old jobs back, etc. They're just a little stiff, and they don't need to sleep. It's a zombie movie without zombies. Its whole purpose seems to be to ask what we'd do, as a society, in such a situation, and for its first hour and change, it provides us with an interesting answer to the question. Unfortunately, then comes the last twenty minutes, where the movie blows up, never regaining its footing.

That first hour, though, is wonderful. Human beings react humanly. There's no sense of sweeping panic, nor any sense that any one character's reactions are supposed to be synecdochic of the whole town; everyone reacts a bit differently, and the town leaders, riddled with their own questions, have a difficult time trying to figure out what to do. (The answer is in no way surprising. Warning: this is not a movie for optimists.) And that first bit is fantastic drama-slash-allegory, the kind of thing we don't see nearly enough.

Then Campillo tries to turn it into... what? A horror film? An action movie? I have no idea. And it goes down the tubes. I've seen some interesting explanations for the final twenty minutes (no one, of course, knows for sure), and I'd be willing to embrace any one of them, or offer up my own, had I managed to make heads or tails of it at all. After I watched it, I went back and watched the final scenes again to see if I'd missed anything, because it didn't seem coherent. Then I did it again. And I came to the conclusion that, no, the simple answer is that the end is an incoherent mess. I cannot adequately express how unfortunate that is, given how great the beginning hour is.

As for the allegory, someone on the IMDB boards called this a zombie movie with Alzheimer's patients instead of zombies. While I think his tongue was planted firmly in his cheek, I do think he's onto something there. The ""zombies"" seem more like people who are suffering from some form of lingering illness that may or may not be terminal (after all, they're already dead, what can kill them a second time?), and that the living try to manage with drugs, therapy, etc. If you've spent any time in rest homes, either working there or visiting relatives with Alzheimer's, the parallel will be chilling. Been there, done that, and I was probably more affected by the movie for it.

Overall, I liked it. It could have been a truly great film. Unfortunately, it's hamstrung by its own ending. ***",1216339200,7,2811,4.625250501002004
2264664,3,B00094ARXC,"I agree with the two reviewers above except to say that I do think the movie is worthwhile, I'm glad it was made, and I'd like to watch it a few more times to completely understand what was presented.  Can I propose that this might be a situation in which a sequel, if made, might improve upon the original?  Not only could so much more have been done with the concept, the producers of this film may not have scratched the surface of what one might consider to be the low-hanging fruit.

However, maybe I'm missing the point.  This concept, as presented, is more complex than simply people coming back to life.  There's an important extra component to the plot: the ""returnees"" don't return as their former selves reincarnated.  They return merely as empty shells of their former selves in that the things they say and do are merely rote repetition of the things they said and did in their former lives, often distorted, like the image you might see in a fun-house mirror.  They seem unable to present any new ideas or think any new thoughts.  Because of this, they wouldn't be able to expound upon what it was like for them before they came back or engage in meaningful emotional exchange.  I'm not sure why this extra component was included.  I can only guess that the producers wanted to show that ""you can never go home again"" or get your passed loved ones back, and that even if such a thing happened, they wouldn't be the same self-animated people that you remember.

Here's a thought that this movie provokes from me.  Do you have an uncle or a friend who's always telling you the same stories over and over?  Or, have you noticed that certain artists' paintings or music all seem like practically identical versions on the same theme?  Or do you ever find yourself thinking or repeating the same themes in your interactions with people you encounter?  I sometimes think that a truly great artist creates works that aren't easily attributable to him or her even by people familiar with the works of that artist - someone whose new works are always original.  What new thoughts have you had lately?  Do you ever ""re-invent yourself"" or do you stick with what you're already good at?  With extra coaxing, I've been re-introduced to many things I previously thought I knew about and didn't like, only to find a new fascination which I had missed before.",1197158400,2,2358,4.613908872901678

2264666,4,B00094ARXC,"I lucked into this little known flick and am glad I did. I am a dedicated horror fan and Zombie films are what I cut my blood-soaked teeth on. Dawn of the Dead(1979) still ranks as my favorite horror flick and since then Ive gotten hold of whatever Zombie flick I could. What Ive learned from that is that there are alot... I mean alot of derivative or just plain bad zombie movies out there. Im somewhat of a traditionalist, I prefer the Romero zombie type but have really enjoyed movies like the Dawn remake or 28 Days Later(contention for whether or not thats really a zombie movie-BEGIN!!)because they did somehting different, showed a side that wasn't standard typical zombie fare. Well if those seemed like departures, wait until you take a gander at this one.
  Simply put, this is a zombie film in the fact that the dead have returned. Thats pretty much where the comparison stops. Yes the dead have returned, in fact the movie starts with the streets of a small French town flooded with almost angelic looking people that very quickly we realize have been dead for years in most cases. They look exactly the same as they did before they died, as if nothing had ever happened and basically try to pick up where they left off. This of course is complicated by the fact that their loved ones have moved on, none of them remember dying and while they all look like themselves,they all have something almost sinister behind their eyes. Also presenting a huge problem for everyone around them-what do we do with them. The questions of why and how these people have returned are quickly replaced with how are they going to become active members of society again. Soon after semi resuming their lives, the returned start clamoring to escape the lives they came back to. They are driven by a need to leave. Some of them meet secretly at night planning something that doesnt materialize until the last few minutes of the movie. I don't think that revealing it would ruin the movie, but Im not gonna say anyway,nyah nyah.
  I can understand anyone seeing this movie and disputing that it is horror. Its not in the traditional sense. Not once is there a jump scare, no gore, they all look and act like completly normal people. What made it count to me is that it plays on more basic human fears. The whole reason(as far as the filmakers are concerned I think) is not to have us afraid of physical monsters that might eat us, its to make us afraid of what we have inside us every day.. fear of the unknown,loss,lonliness the true fear of having what you want given to you only to find out its not what you thought it was. It even plays the terrorism angle at one point. What would you do if someone you loved turned out to be capable of violent acts for their own agenda? But its not played that heavy as there are no real victims of the ""acts of terrorism""(to quote myself) in the film. Its more rumination on life and letting go than it is anything else and what struck me was that in those cases,those scenes rattled me in a way that horror movies usually don't. Basic human emotion can be just as scary as any monster.
  The film itself is beuatifully shot and all the acting is great. It is a pet peeve of mine when movies of this type go the exra mile to explain whats happening instead of dealing with it and the fact that the reason the dead came back is not touched on makes it more mysterious and eerie and the reactions by the characters around them add to that atmosphere. Everyone in the movie realistically portrays what is almost impossible to imagine. What would you do if someone you loved dearly had passed away and you had just started getting on with your life and there they were. The best example of this in the film is a middle aged couple who've had their son returned to them and the difficulty it creates in their relationship. As they realize their son wants to leave again, all their guilt,anger with each other and desire to do whats best for their son(or themselves) comes bubbling to the surface. You don't see that in Resident Evil.",1168300800,7,4060,4.472334682860999

There were no real conflicts.  Then it was over.  You might try to ponder the question of whether some of us are alive but not really living, but thats a stretch not implied by the movie.  I gave it 2 stars, because it was well made and had a nice eerie feel to it and good visual images, but it should never have been made.

2264680,3,B00094ARXC,"I want to say straight away: the concept of the film was great if not to say ingenious. This is the first movie where dead people don't act like blood and flesh-thirsty creatures, here they are ""returnees"" who came back and want to return to their normal lives. Just think how many possibilities can this astonishing plot afford - people who are happy to see their deceased ones, those who don't want to meet them at all because (admit it) it's pretty eerie, one of the marriage-partners returnes and sees that the other one is already living happily with another person (and what would that another person do in this situation), a murder victim meets his killer (what would be the reaction), should a murderer be judged after he's returned?
There's a million questions the makers of the film could ask but they didn't. Instead they are concentrating on a couple of returnees' lives after their comeback, but this concentration doesn't lead anywhere. I can say that there are many uneasy and sombre moments in the film, the atmosphere of total incomprehension of what happened is done great, but it's one of those cases when we ask ourselves after the final credits: so what does this all mean? along with many other questions. No answers are given by the director. None.
And talking of questions - if some person returns from the dead and begins to live normally among people, and if you know this person - wouldn't you want to ask him something? I bet you would. And I'm pretty sure I know exactly what you are going to ask him about. But noone asks in the movie! I was waiting the whole 2 hours - and nothing. Just some kid tried to say something but grown-ups obturated him quickly. And noone else asks. When such things happen - I don't believe a film. Living dead are OK but not asking them about what they experienced is improbable.
So I gave it 3 stars for a try but it could have been much better. Speaking frankly it could be a real masterpiece.",1129248000,,1955,4.541076487252124

Don't think i'm some gore-fest fan that only likes movies with exploding heads. I like interesting innovative movies, or atleast a different take on the classic movie (such as Shawn of the Dead).  The premise for They Came Back had great potential.  A ""zombie"" movie were the dead could integrate into society.  Lots of possibilities in the relationship area.  This movie was unbelivably boring and long.  The ""Zombies"" just act like they are really stoned.  Character development is extremely thin and not at all compelling.  The resolution / climax was confusing and non existant.  As other reviewers pointed out, none of the critical questions were addressed, let alone awnsered.

2264683,1,B00094ARXC,"This movie had one of the best premises: the recently dead inexplicably come back to life and return in droves to the cities they had once lived in and the families they had left behind.  Unlike typical films of this genre, these ""zombies"" aren't brain hungry maniacs.  They are perfectly normal looking in every way, save a condition which renders them incapable of creative thinking (?!?  See below) and the fact that their body temperatures are slightly lower than normal.

So what's the suspense, the thrills or even horror of this film?  Nothing really.  It's about as exciting as watching over-the-hill french people meander around because that's precisely what happens.  One of the major plot points revolves around the problem of integration.  With thousands of unexpected citizens returning to life, what is a government to do?  How can families cope having mostly healed from the loss of their loved ones, only to get them back so unexpectedly?  While these questions might sound good on paper, the fact that I have already mentioned the plot works itself out through meandering frenchies should give you a clue to how effectively they are answered.

Really, to like this film you have to want to, you have to have tremendous patience and you have to be a little more pretentious than the average film goer.  As for me, I need a film to be a little more than unusual and French to keep my interest.  This was no ""nifty nail-biter,"" nor a ""triumph of internal horror.""  I was so disappointed that I immediately placed this dvd for sale on amazon's merchant marketplace.

But the real coup de grace is the much hyped secret zombie plan.  This is what kept me going.  This is what gave me the motivation to sit through 103 minutes of dullness.  Sorry folks, there is no reprieve.  The secret zombie plan was to blow up buildings (with no occupants) and then flee into underground tunnels.  Why?  That's a good question.  If it isn't answered by french people meandering on and off screen, then it isn't answered.  And it isn't answered by french people meandering on and off screen.  (Also, how did they create this plan if they have problems with creative thinking?)

I hated this film.  Not simply because I'm a hard core zombie fan that wanted to try something that was BOTH <u>interesting</u> and different.  Not simply because I expect thrills and suspense in a film that promises it.  Not simply because the script sucked and the actors were ugly.  I hated this film because it was nothing and yet it was hyped up so much on its dvd packaging that I was suckered into buying it.  Don't make the same mistake.

2264684,4,B00094ARXC,"And, for that matter, not really a zombie flick. This work is much more than that. I found it profoundly moving, and felt it hitting buttons of recognition all through. Lives that had sort-of healed over or, perhaps more correctly, re-grouped following the agony of grief, are suddenly being prised open again. One day, unexpectedly, the local cemetery spills into the main street all those who have died in the past ten years. Not everyone wants to risk reunion, but it is a seductive possibility. It soon is clear, however, that things can never be what they once were. Hopes newly awakened seem doomed even from the start. But I found myself tagging along thinking, ""Maybe..."". The threat in this movie is not physical danger, although there is a slowly brooding and unsettling soundtrack, and a sense that you don't quite know what is happening. The threat is more to emotional security, and it is in the form of recognising these people for who they are and taking the risk of allowing them to be what they once were in your life. I found myself many times saying ""Yes, that is what it would be like"" and, finally, ""Yes, that is the way it must be"". This, in a sense, is not a happy ending in terms of one of Campillo's original inspirations: the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. These people do not threaten physically, but emotionally and in terms of our security. We soon find ourselves locking them away, guarding them, being suspicious of them and perhaps even inventing reasons why they should be excluded. This is a movie about recognition and risk, and finality. It is not action-packed, but in its persistent probing of your humanity it will have you thinking a long time after you have seen it.",1125619200,3,1718,4.69205298013245
2264685,3,B00094ARXC,"Well... I bought this DVD with a lot of anticipation because when I read the synopsis, I thought ""Wow, what a way of putting things""... I meant... the dead returning... ALIVE? And there was more: society trying to cope with the fact that those ""revenants"" had to go back to their families, work, etc...

I found the approach very unusual and with endless narrative possibilities.

But after seeing the movie, I found it to be (sadly) dissapointing.

First.

Not that the story and the premisse are not great. They are. But after that the story has nothing to offer. The story starts with the incredible flow of people walking down the streets. We see the response from the authorities... the shelters... the meetings... the discussions... the first reactions from the living (all very interesting).

...But I did not see the thing I wanted to see: people asking the question I would ask (if I were to be in their place) - WHY IT HAPPENED AND HOW IT HAPPENED?... Because this is the question that frightens us the most (specially if there is no answer for it). People may argue that the film is not about the cause... but about the effect. Ok, but questioning the cause is part of the effect (and the fact that there is no answer would only add to the drama)

Second.

People came back from death (the biggest question mark over mankind)... and nobody asks what was like to be dead? Nobody explores this question? It seems like the film misses some key issues just in order to be different (but ""key issues"" are key issues because of some reason...)

Third.

After 50 minutes, the film looses all its steam because the story runs out of complications. So... they act bizarre... THEN WHAT? Well... they stroll every night... THEN WHAT?? Well... nobody's sure if they are the same people... THEN WHAT??? Well... they don't talk much... PLEASE!! THEN WHAT??????

This is probably the first ""non-horror""-horror film (laughs) where the only abnormal story element is the strangeness of the characters (that never pays off).

Fourth.

The ending... again we have a story that is bult on a great premisse but doesn't know how to end (and cheats the viewer under a mask of subjectiveness and obscurity). We don't really know what happens at the end. The obscurity goes like this: ""Oh, maybe they wrere never here..."" or ""Oh, maybe they were here, but no quite"" or ""maybe they were a contructon of the living"" or ""Oh, maybe blah blah blah""

But if you consider a premisse this strong (the dead are back. They are not the same and we have to deal with them) such an ending is very unsatisfying.

But I still liked the movie. And I'd still recomend it for its radical different approach on zombies (well... these are not zombies... but that's another discussion).

I just don't see the point on making a horror film for those who hate horror films (and I think there is something of this here). I am not saying this film should go after the gore we see everywhere else. There are other ways of frighten people without any gore. There are ways of taking such a strong premisse to the climax it deserved. If the screenwriter (and the director) was trying to be different just to be different... well... they missed the chance to make the horror film of the decade.

And if you are looking for the genesis of the series, you're not going to find much beyond the premise and a few cinematic moments (more in the spoilers section).

However, this movie stands on its own as a haunting, muted depiction of how we behave when our loved ones betray our expectations. This emotional undercurrent is layered with mythic allusions, especially in the three primary plots. The cinematography deliberately creates distance and then broaches it, alternating darkness and/or black and white film with vibrant color. The ending - I think - is meant to be open to interpretation; however, I also believe that it has something to say about the choices we all make regarding our loved ones and the choices we make about how much uncertainty we are willing to live with. I want to watch this movie again.

Les Revenants treats the subject of meetings - work meetings, community meetings, etc. - fairly extensively. The living are having meetings about the returned. The returned are having meetings about? What? It must be something scary, right? Especially since over the course of the film, the livings' meetings go from how to reintegrate the returned into the community to - ultimately - controlling, segregating, and various other ways we treat the ones we ""other."" Much of what is in the living's meetings is somewhat controversial if you think about it - the jokes about Big Brother (and only about the living - not about the returned, who begin the film with privacy rights and anti-discrimination protections but lose them as their differences become more well-known).

There is also some reference to the pharmaceutical industry, which becomes even more ominous if one stops to consider how they know what they know about a drug's effects on the returned. How was it tested? On whom? Who gave permission? And I think there is definitely a message in the end about which population proves more dangerous. And what that message is depends on your perspective.

Ultimately, while the tv series seems, to me, to be about the deeply personal ways humans handle grief, the film examines modern society and the extent to which we are willing to protect and accept people who are different. Especially when they are so different that we can't quite figure them out. But, like the series (or rather, foreshadowing the series), the film also depicts three returned people and their relationships with the people closest to them, highlighting the very different ways in which the living process the return of their loved ones. In those relationships, you can see where the stories of Simon and Adele and Camille and Victor got their starts. There are also a couple of exterior shots that inform some of the iconic moments of the series. And the tunnels. There are the tunnels. Much to think about.
