3683836,5,B001LK8TEM,"DC's latest animated release is a fitting addition to the Wonder Woman mythos.  The performances are uniformly strong, the animation is excellent and the script is engaging.  The film weaves the Wonder Woman origin with a classic battle of the Greek gods for a very satisfying story.  The cat and mouse between Diana and Steve Trevor is sophisticated and clever.  A strong point of the feature.  I was skeptical of ""Felicity"" voicing such a strong female character, but was pleasantly surprised.  The chemistry between Russell and Fillion resulted in a satisfying pay-off.

As a parent of young children (7, 5, and 13 months), I'm giving fair warning of the violence level.  This feature includes strong battle violence, including decapitation and sword thrusts through the chest.  It's not gratuitous, but this is an unabashed PG/PG-13 film.

All in all, my favorite of the DC Universe efforts so far.  This was the only of the features that left me wanting future installments.  One can only hope that the forthcoming live action movie is as good.",1235779200,7,1049,5.0
3683837,5,B001LK8TEM,"DC is doing way better than Marvel with there animated releases over the past few years and this movie is the best out of all.
The story is really good with an excellent voice acting cast, animation is good, very funny and topped up with adult content. Oh yes and more action than anything else out there i.e. Avengers 1 & 11, Iron man, Dr Strange, Young Avengers, Hulk vs., its even better than Batman: Gothem Knights ""now my second favorite"", Justice League: The New Frontier, Superman: Doomsday.
Bottom line this is an epic that delivers!",1235779200,6,541,4.645833333333333
3683838,5,B001LK8TEM,"I just got done watching Wonder Woman and this pushes ""Girl Power"" to the next level!! The story is amazing, not to mention the brutal fighting throughout the movie. These woman fight and they fight HARD!! The animation is top notch and surprisingly its a very funny movie, with the underlying tone of Battle-of-the-Sexes.
 Keri Russell does a terrific job as Wonder Woman, although I feel her charecter could have had more of a personal outlook. Steve Trevor steals most of the thunder because of his many one liners, while WW is the muscle and driving force. The rest of the charecters are dead on. The Queen shows you why she is Queen in the first 3 minutes of the movie, which is a thrill ride. A GREAT way to start things off!!
 The music is epic, as it should be since it is dealing with Greek mythology. There are times I thought ""how come this is not in the movie theatres?""
 This is NOT for kids, although it is something I would show my niece. She is 9, but I want her to have a strong female role model to at least watch. The fight scenes are vicious, cold, unforgiving, and keeps on coming till the end!! In fact, I found that the MPAA gave this movie a rated ""R"" so Bruce Timm (producer & director) and his team had to edit some of the film. Trust me, you will see why, and he hinted that that if this movie has enough sales and enough demands they will release the ""Unrated"" version. YES!!
 If I had to compare it to the other DC movies, Wonder Woman is FAR at the top and will be hard to beat. Marvel has never come close to anything like DC did here. Hulk VS was just mindless violence with no story. It might just be me, but I have to like the charecters and care about them if I'm going to enjoy it. Plus, I find Marvel's animated style is very choppy. I have been patient with them coming up with a good animated film, but DC owns this department.
 Do yourself a favor and pick it up as soon as its released. I saw a special preview of it (tee hee). It was only a one time watch and now I can't wait to watch it on my HD screen. If I had to rate DC's movies from favorite to least favorite it would be:

1) Wonder Woman
2) Justice League: The New Frontier
3) Batman: Gothem Knights
4) Superman: Doomsday

 I'm not saying Superman was horrible by any means. Its just you can really see the progress DC has made with their movies. They are learning and doing it well every step of the way. Batman: GK was a TERRIFIC story, but lacked the action I think most of us were hoping to find.
 Because of this film I'm now a Wonder Woman fan. I have already been reading her comics of the past few months (Rise of the Olympians) and its truely great writing thanks to Gail Simone. I love her work. Well, I think I'm done for the review. I hope you all will enjoy the movie as much as I have. I can't wait to see what the other reviewers like yourselves have to say. I have read others on the movie and they are just as excited as I was watching the movie!! Enjoy. :)",1235347200,29,2975,4.133217993079585
3683839,5,B001LK8TEM,"When I first heard rumors of a Wonder Woman movie being written by Joss Whedon a few years back, all of my inner (and outer) geek squealed with delight.  So imagine my disappointment upon hearing that WW had fallen through.  Then along came this animated film.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  The voice actors have some serious credentials to their names, mostly big time film & t.v. stars.  I loved the caliber of work done in the Justice League series but hoped for something a little more adult-friendly.  And this is exactly what we've got.  I've seen it mentioned that this film is rated PG-13 and that's exactly on the nose.  The worst word is ""crap"" but there is some heavy violence with little to no blood spilt.  Though I think some of the voice actors got a little overzealous with some of their (at times, cheesy) lines (Rosario Dawson AND Keri Russell), overall I felt that it went well.  A co-producer of the film is Bruce Timm, of Batman & Robin fame (I thought I saw some of his handiwork in some of the art...)

The bottom line: I would highly recommend this film to any Justice League, Trinity, Bruce Tim, Batman & Robin animated series and, of course, Wonder Woman fans.  It also bears mentioning that Gail Simone, alongside another writer, wrote the script and is the current writer for Wonder Woman as well as the past writer for the great series ""Birds of Prey.""  I know I'll be getting my copy.",1235347200,23,1416,4.5058823529411764
3683840,5,B001LK8TEM,"i long anticipated this wonder woman animated flick and i must say, it did not disappoint.  the story is solid as both an origin and the first part of what could be several sequels.  it really lays the ground work to leave you thirsty for more!  the highlight for me was definitely nathan fillion as steve t.  he brought just the right amount of humor.  of course, that the story was co-written by gail simone is a help.  she had the best run of birds of prey comics i have ever read.  i expect a lot of action from a wonder woman feature and this had more than i hoped for with its bullets, beheadings and, of course, babes.  ""keri russell as wonder woman..."" was never the beginning of a sentence i thought i would say, but i must admit, she pulled it off.  and kudos need to be given to both virginia madsen and rosario dawson.  this flick is a must for any ww or dc fan.",1235001600,7,874,4.148809523809524
3683841,5,B001LK8TEM,"As I watched the opening sequence of the Wonder Woman animated movie, I couldn't help but think, what a no brainer. An army of Amazon women fighting an epic action packed and extremely violent battle against the god of war and the hordes of Hades. I mean it was a beautiful and exciting opening that got me psyched for a great movie. I must admit, it was so good that part of me was wondering if this was going to be the highlight of the movie. It wasn't.

The movie progresses forward in time and plot with a story that is part epic mythological tale, part action adventure and part... romantic comedy?!? And it totally works.

I wasn't expecting the movie to be so funny or violent, but both attributes make it extremely enjoyable. The Amazons are warriors and we get to see them in battle after blood battle, the strongest of the warriors cutting a bloody path through their enemies. The action is fast paced, bloody and violent. In the talk back that followed the screening, Bruce Timm explained that the first cut received an ""R"" rating for violence and some things had to be cleaned up to get the rating down to PG-13. He did say, depending on sales and demand, the R rated cut may be released in the future. (So everyone, go buy the dvd and demand the R rated cut!!) Even so, the violence is still top notch, the death count in this movie is quite high.

The comedy was a pleasant surprise. The movie has an excellent voice cast. Nathan Fillion has some of the funniest lines, and his delivery only makes it funnier. Wonder Woman's interaction with Fillion's character Steve Trevor, and her introduction to man's world lends itself to some great comedic moments. One of my favorites is when Wonder Woman innocently explains to a little girl how to sword fight in such a way that she will take down the boys who are not letting her play in their pretend sword fighting game.

The movie is light on drama, but the characterization and relationships are all handled extremely well. This is Wonder Woman's origin, but the supporting characters get their moment to shine.

Its only weakness seems to be its mandatory run time. I was enjoying this movie so much that I was disappointed when it ended. The action moves so quickly that at times, I felt it could have used more of a transition or explanation from one local to the next, but I was having so much fun that I went with it and didn't mind the moments that felt a little rushed.

In short, Bruce Timm, Lauren Montgomery, Michael Jelenic and the rest of the production team have trumped all the previous efforts of the new DC Universe Animated films. Wonder Woman sets a new high mark, which I hope they can match in future efforts, especially since I hear the next one might be Green Lantern. I can't wait.",1233964800,10,2766,4.5
3683842,5,B001LK8TEM,"This straight to DVD feature is the fourth in DC Universe/Warner Premiere's new line of animated features. They have released Superman: Doomsday, Justice League: New Frontier and Batman: Gotham Knight. Now we can experience Wonder Woman, a feature that finally gives DC's third biggest icon the attention and, for the most part, the portrayal she deserves.

The plot is an origin story about the amazon princess Diana and how a crash landed pilot named Steve Trevor and a run in with God Of War Ares finds her coming of age while proving herself to her mother and fellow amazons and becoming the Wonder Woman we all know and love. The story is well enough written, working hard to serve the spectacularly animated battle scenes. My only issue is that it doesn't serve the character's as much as it could and certain key moments end up getting brushed over as a result. Despite these issues and some weak plot points it is still entertaining and action packed from beginning to very end, which is what most will be looking for.

Voice's of the character's are provided by Keri Russell as the young Wonder Woman/Diana, Nathan Fillion as crash landed pilot Steve Trevor, Alfred Molina as the God of War Ares, Virigina Madsen as Diana's mother Queen Hippolyta and Rosario Dawson voicing Diana's fellow amazon Artemis. I feel all the actor's lend their voices to the characters quite well setting their own personalities aside to really play the part of the character's despite some cliche lines to be found.

This feature is rated PG-13 and it works hard to earn that rating. There are many nods to adult situations (most in passing or to provide humor), and there are many action filled battle scenes that show multiple killings though only specific shots of blood. That said I do find it odd that they took a more mature rating and only used it for more violence and risque jokes. It would have been nice to get deeper into the character's and have a more mature story to go along with the more graphic content but that's just a personal preference of mine and they did only have 74 minutes.

The production quality on these feature's has been steadily increasing with each one Warner and DC put out. The animation is truly amazing here with incredible directing details that only add to the overall quality of this feature. There are certain color filter's seemingly used at wonderfully chosen times as well as a level of depth and detail displayed that fans of these features have been waiting for. The sound quality is great with an epic score worthy of a summer blockbuster and sound mixing quality that adds more depth to the experience.

Overall the animation was spectacular, the best Warner Premiere has done yet. The story while suffering some pacing issues (to be expected in a 74 min. feature trying to tell such an epic story), was true enough to the character and is overall well done and enjoyable. The voice actor's were for the most part spot on and made me believe the character's. I was also surprised to find a fair amount of humor and a remnant of a love story mixed into the plot. Here's hoping that they will create some sort of sequels to this. I definitely give it 5 stars on blue spandex, especially for anyone who is a fan of well depicted heroines or Wonder Woman herself. Thanks For Your Time.",1231113600,57,3319,4.676369863013699
3683843,5,B001LK8TEM,"I have been anticipating this film since a First Look Featurette for it was revealed to be a special feature on the Batman: Gotham Knight DVD. After months of waiting and hyping myself up I was worried it may not be able to deliver but I'm happy to say I certainly feel like it delivered and then some. Wonder Woman's origin is wonderfully told in this amazing animated epic and my biggest issue is that this feature was only seventy four minutes long.

The story has a lot to cover and this feature really tells two stories in half the time that a summer blockbuster has to tell one. The first being about the Amazon's long running battle with Ares and trying to conclude that and the second being about Diana's first experiences in man's world and her journey to finally becoming Wonder Woman. The film maker's obviously knew they were taking on a lot and I certainly admire that they would rather try something great and fail than do something lackluster and succeed. They have a few pacing issues, certain key moments may be given limited time to allow for more gratuitous battle scenes and sure there are some plot threads that suddenly appear unexpectedly at the end but overall the story is coherent, true enough to the character's and has some rewarding payoffs.

The animation is AMAZING especially when compared to that attempted in Superman: Doomsday but even still compared to the beautiful work done in Justice League: New Frontier. Each time they put out a new feature DC/WP manage to top themselves and improve upon their previous efforts. I  thought it was well directed especially the two major battle scenes and multiple fight scenes. It's always the little things that make an animated feature and this one has them all over from the Themiscyra scenes all being bathed in a subtle warming white light to the amazing detail of the first shot of New York.

I thought the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio track played great and I loved the epic score and summer blockbuster quality sound mixing. Some people have said they didn't like the voice casting/acting but I found it well done and they made me believe the character's with the little fault I found being in the writing. In fact other than the short time limit the only issues I had can be blamed on the writing.

Issues I did find in the feature were that while having a mature rating it never tried to have a truly mature story for adults, and while the story they did tell was entertaining and certainly served the action scenes I personally would have liked a little more service to the character's themselves. I don't feel they destroyed the characters or betrayed them by any means but I do feel they could have served them better, especially Diana. That is all just personal opinion though and doesn't take away from the excellent production quality found here.

Overall my only issues are with what isn't here, but that is entirely forgivable given the quality of what is here and how well it holds up together. If only they could have made this feature a two hour epic and released it in theaters with a little more focus on script then any issues I have with it could have easily been resolved, but I think if my biggest problem is that it's so well done I wish I could experience more than that means they've done a more than wonderful job.

This feature is really just the starting point for the character and hopefully they will produce more Wonder Woman independent feature's if not direct sequels to this feature itself. The way it ends with Diana having really just become Wonder Woman leaves viewer's wanting more of her character and I hope that's what DC and Warner Premiere intend to give us. 5 stars on blue spandex. Thanks for your time.",1231113600,16,3732,4.628398791540786
3683844,5,B001LK8TEM,"Warner Bros. Premiere have been putting out DC Universe animated features revolving around the Detective Comics characters. First came Superman: Doomsday based on the record selling comic book story in which Superman is actually killed, second came Justice League: The New Frontier based on award winning graphic novel's about the earliest beginnings of the Justice League, then Batman: Gotham Knight was animated with strong anime influence and told several stories set between the two latest live action films (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). Now we can finally experience the animated DC Universe depiction of Wonder Woman's origin.

The plot is about the amazon princess Diana, on the secluded Island Themyscira, first meeting Steve Trevor, a pilot who crash lands on the island of no men. After fighting in a tournament against fellow competing amazons for the right to escort Trevor back to 'man's world' Diana dons the Wonder Woman outfit for her first time and heads on her first outing. As she tries to understand the world of man Diana must deal with the threat of God Of War Ares, who has escaped from a centuries long imprisonment and is looking to start trouble.

Voice casting includes Keri Russell (Famous for Felicity, and more recently Waitress, August Rush and Bedtime Stories) as the young Wonder Woman. Nathan Fillion (co-starred with Russell in Waitress) as Steve Trevor. Alfred Molina (Doc Oc in Spider-man 2) as God Of War Ares, Virigina Madsen (Co-star of Jim Carrey in Number 23) as Diana's mother Queen Hippolyta and Rosario Dawson (Seven Pounds with Will Smith) as Dianna's rival amazon Artemis.

There are three versions released. The Blu-Ray, the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD (with Digital Copy) and the Single Edition DVD. Features included with the Two-Disc DVD and Blu-Ray will be:

Disc 1- Commentary by the creative team, also as is customary with these releases a first look at DC/Warner's next animated feature project 'Green Lantern'.

Disc 2- 2 Documentaries- Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream, and Wonder Woman Daughter of Myth: Historical Amazon Lore and it's Evolution into the Modern Day Wonder Woman Character. Also as usual with these releases two episodes selected from the Justice League series are included as Bruce Timm's favorite picks: To Another Shore and Hawk And Dove.

The feature itself has a running time of 74 min. and is presented like the other features in widescreen format. These features are PG-13 and this one works hard to earn that rating. There are nods to adult situations (often occuring in brief passing or to provide humor) as well as alot of action scenes and killing but only a few specific uses of blood. This is not something recommended for children but is perfect for preteens and teenagers. Still parent's are capable of using their own discretion.

About the quality you can expect if you haven't seen the other recent features, DC/Warner have been delivering top notch animation on these features rivaling that of Disney's straight to DVD releases and I think this one has the best animation yet. The stories are always well written and stay true to source materials that the characters are taken from. Another thing these new features have done well is providing alot of well staged action scenes and still delivering fine moments of character development/exploration that I haven't seen since Batman The Animated Series.

This is the first solo animated feature for Wonder Woman and I feel it  portrays her with the dignity DC's third biggest icon deserves and the same respect she was granted in the Justice League series, which to me is the most believably she has been depicted thus far (if only because of her lack of exposure in this medium to date). I hope there will be some sort of sequels developed for this film as it was such a good starting point for the character that it seems a shame to leave off here when she has really only just begun her role as Wonder Woman as the feature reaches it's end.

Overall the animation was spectacular, the best Warner Premiere has done yet. The story while suffering some pacing issues (to be expected in a 74 min. feature trying to tell such an epic story), was true to the character and is overall well done and enjoyable. The score was worthy of a summer blockbuster and perfectly matched the epic tone. The voice actor's were for the most part spot on and made me believe the character's and think of them as seperate entities from the actor's voicing them. There is even a fair amount of humor and a bit of a love story mixed into the plot that only adds to the viewer's enjoyment. As well the DVD has a fair amount of special features that I found enjoyable to watch. I definitely give it 5 stars on blue spandex, especially for anyone who is a fan of well depicted heroines or Wonder Woman herself. Thanks For Your Time.",1231113600,223,4860,4.844578313253012

This movies is at it's best when Wonder Woman succeeds by defying the men in the movie.

But the movie's real strength is that it is simply a good super hero movie.  It does not dwell on the fact the the hero is female.  It just lets the main character be strong and confident because that's what a super hero is, male or female.  What makes it empowering is the roles women usually get in Hollywood have to cow-tow to the bigger male roles.

3683900,5,B001LK8TEM,"Actress Gal Gadot who plays the titular Wonder Woman/ Diana and director Patty Jenkins deserve the credit theyve received as WW is a fun, action-packed, and entertaining superhero adventure with some iconically imagined moments like when WW ascends a battlefield ladder in No Mans Land, a piece of muddy and shredded and bloodied earth where neither the Germans nor the British can cross (the setting is World War I), and as she rises to the top a bullet comes screaming directly at her and in slow motion she sees it and deflects it with her wrist bracelets and then looks determinedly toward the other side, hair brushing back by the desperate wind, and then she bolts forward defying the death clutches of deadly tract over which she practically flies.  The visuals and those stylized moments which often capture an emotional swell are what make WW so successful I think and are ably supported out of the directors vision and the main and supporting actors across the board.  The story isn't as incredible but is good and is bolstered by the visuals and those moments.  We are introduced to Diana as she is a mere child and we are introduced to the race of Amazonians that she belongs to and their native Themyscira.  It is a beautiful eden, without men, and the film develops from this lush and gorgeous environment which smartly makes the transition to smog-choked London and the bleary oil-smudged frontlines of the war within European cityscapes all the more stark and realized.  Diana, who has saved an American spy and now accompanies him (Steve Trevor played by the new Star Treks Captain KirkChris Pine), gets to know the dank and cramped world of man and theres both satisfying humor as her direct and nave approach makes her the fish-out-of-water (but the fish you better watch out for!) as well as providing an outsiders view to the horrors of what man can perpetrate on man.  This is another smart and satisfying play on the story.  Unfortunately the story almost peters out at the end as the structure of the story sets Wonder Woman (and us) up to doubt that the war is caused by the god of war himself, Ares.  Wonder Woman begins to doubt the truth of this and I cant help but think how satisfying it would have been if she discovered that he wasn't behind it, but it was the dark hearts of man, and how that would have made her wrestle with her own beliefs and volitional choices.  The film gives us a hint of this before revealing Ares being exactly the villain Diana thought him to be and they fight in traditional superhero fashion and with her coming up with inexplicably new powers not remotely hinted at previously in the film (which personally off-set me upon first viewing and upon further viewing made me feel it was a cheap way for her to overcome her enemy).  Still, up to that finale Wonder Woman flies forward in exciting fashion and she also serves as a superhero role model (for both girls and boys) just like Captain America, paragons of virtue who try to live the ideals they have been taught and believe to be right.  4.75 stars.",1517529600,,3065,4.636531365313653

3683930,5,B001LK8TEM,"As someone who grew up with the ""Great Books"" theory of ""liberal"" education, and a reader of ""Wonder Woman"" comics as a boy and young adult, I was pleased to have been reminded of the ""Classical"" nature of the story lines.  ""Homer"" would have been pleased with the story lines of the ""hero"", the heavy Greek culture, and the discussion of the Gods, such as Zeus and Aries.  The morality and the story of war between humans was very well told and for a generation of students, who might not have gotten the classical education in our ""modern"" times, the film may have been an eye opener?  Each generation may or may not rediscover the issues of those who came before as well as the decisions Wonder Woman made in terms of committing ""violence"" in the spirit of what she had determined as ""good"".  Wonder Woman made decisions she has to live with and some of them shall turn out to be ""good"" and some of them may fall short of her expectations.  But the decisions she made shall determine the person she becomes as she asks the ""age old"" question, we of ""modern"" society don't ask anymore, which is ""why am I here""?  Homer and the others told a ""story"" and taught morality along the way as they looked to define what was ""good"" and what does an ""educated"" person know?  I enjoyed the film but thought to myself.., ""do the artists who created this film, actually understand the questions they are raising and how humans have always grappled with the thoughts of ""good"" and ""evil""?  Perhaps the young by the film may be inspired to ""read"" the story of Achilles or learn of the woman General ""Artemisia of Caria""?  I was annoyed by the ""300"" film, whereas she died during the final fatal battle with the Athenians, when the truth is that she made her way safety through the burning ships of the battle to live to an old, ripe, and rich age as a wealthy woman.  So ""Hollywood"" sometimes changes history to suit their ""ending"" or they just don't care?  But shouldn't young women and young men learn the story of Artemisia and the choices she made?  Good film, good story.., need more such as this.., but I would urge the young to ""read"" the books and use their own imaginations in support of the ""film"", as there is nothing better than ""thinking"" human beings and the questions that determine our lives.",1515628800,2,2296,4.506024096385542

3683933,4,B001LK8TEM,"Wonder Woman (2017). Rated PG-13. Single-Disc. Running Time: 2 hours, 21 mins.
Directed by Patty Jenkins.
Fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe.

This movie takes place after Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).

The movie begins with Diana (Gal Gadot) in Present Day, Paris, France. She receives an old photographic plate of herself with four men, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremmer) and Chief Napi (Eugene Brave Rock) during World War I in 1918.
  This takes us back into Diana's memory when she was a little girl (Lilly Aspen) on the secretly hidden island of Themyscira. It is an island with no men.  Diana sees the other women training to be a warrior and it excites her to jump off a building, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) grabs her by the arm and stops her.
  Now it is 1918 and Diana is a woman having been trained to be a warrior by her sister Antiope (Robin Wright) and taught the Amazonian history, as well as, Zeus and Ares. Diana has super powers.
  Near the sea, an American plane, piloted by Steve Taylor breaks through the barrier and crashes off the Themysciran coast. Diana saves his life and from a crew of a German ship that was also after Steve and about to get through the barrier. Steve is a spy in World War I and needs to continue his mission in London, England. Diana leaves the island to help Steve, but she is on her own mission to kill Ares to stop the war in the outside world.

Also in the cast: Emily Carey, Danny Huston, David Thewlis. Zack Snyder plays a U.S. combat soldier.

(I was not disappointed) I see a lot of people giving it one star because they apparently couldn't read the ratings of the movie and they presumed that an animated movie is just for children. I have so many issues with that.
1) We don't need to shelter out children from every little thing. It's a movie, ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE with your children while watching it. Children can watch any movie if you communicate clearly with them. You know BE A PART OF THEIR LIVES instead of let the TV DO IT FOR YOU.
2) If you are concerned about content then take the time to read the ratings. Don't be lazy.
3) How shortsighted and myopic do you have to be to think an entire medium is just for children? Many animated movies are even R rated, some are even NC-17. Cartoons are not exclusive to children.",1497571200,,925,4.32183908045977

The sarcastic humor was there (laugh out loud funny), along with the action, and solid storyline. This movie is a good intro into the story of Wonder Woman, with appearances by Steve Trevor and Hippolyta, as well as popular gods and goddesses. I'm not sure how similar this movie's plot is to the new live action Wonder Woman but i think it is worth checking both out. This is definitely geared toward adults, with the jokes and comments. Death is depicted too. The gender commentary was well said, showing both sides to the issue. Excellent movie, the animation was amazing and really highlighted Wonder Woman in a great, lasting way.

3684091,4,B001LK8TEM,"Ok...

Animation is great, voice actors are great, storyline is decent, blah blah blah. Ok so let's get real.

I want a Wonder Woman animated series after watching this. It was a great way of telling a story of women that are strong and independent however they don't claim to know nor act as if they know everything. These women are badass. The problem comes in with the male character that crashes into their island. Literally begins problematic and ends problematic because of him, (and yes, Ares is also garbage). I hated to see the fact that they wrote Diana as a strong woman who is fully aware of the misogyny and sexism she received the minute she landed on Earth to a woman with a grocery bag who gets her car door opened by this dude who's trying to take away from her strength. The writing of trying to make men and women seem not so different was severely written wrong. There's really no way she should have fallen in love with a guy that tries to get her drunk to have sex and in a pathetic speech about why he feels as he does about her, throws multiple insults at her character. I really hope the live action movie isn't like this one. I'll be upset.

I only gave this 4 stars because other characters were written really well. I'd still love a Wonder Woman animated series.",1485993600,,1290,4.389121338912134

3684162,4,B001LK8TEM,"I recently took another look at the DC Animated Film Wonder Woman. I wanted to experience a good DC film after the travesty that was the recent Batman v Superman. I recall that Gal Godot was Wonder Woman was one of the best aspects of that movie. While I disagree with that sentiment, I am very fond of the Amazon Princess, and wanted to be reminded of the great character I watched on Justice League when I was younger. While this entry is very good, it falls just short of great, or at least the great potential Wonder Woman has.
 This film was made way back in the old days of 2009, and was one of the first entries into the DC Animated Films line. Something that occurred to me then, and seems to have more or less played out over the years, is that DC has a tendency to test out potential live-action big budget films with animated prototypes; an experiment to see how they could perform on the big screen, if you will. That certainly seems to be the case here for Wonder Woman, despite the great length of time it has taken Warner Bros. to get there (and they still haven't 7 years later). This is a very good origin story for Wonder Woman, based on George Prezs reboot Gods and Mortals from 1987, just after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rebooted the entire DC Universe(s). Given Prezs great history as a comic writer, with titles like The Avengers and The New Teen Titans under his belt, this is a good staring point. Plus, this film was written by Gail Simone, arguably the greatest female comic writer of all-time, so there is no shortage of talent when it comes to this films story, and it certainly shows.
This movie puts Wonder Woman in a modern setting, seeing her reactions to mans world as we know it. I think this is the best place to start with her, instead of a period piece, because she is as new to the world as the world is to her, providing a great parallel contrast to her development as a character, and the development of mans world into a place that is better in some areas and just as bad as before in others. The plot hits all the points it needs to for an origin film. The pacing is good, and there are no heavy twists to overcomplicate anything. The action is fairly good for what it is, standard PG-13 fare. You don't actually see any of the blood or most fatalities, so don't go in expecting God of War or 300. Dianas character is rounded and develops well and naturally, as does the male lead, Steve Trevor, Dianas own Lois, if you will. The animation style is pretty close to the designs of the legendary Bruce Timm, who is also one of the producers, so you know you cant go wrong there.
The cast is, for the most part, pretty good. Virginia Madsen does alright as Dianas mother Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, although perhaps she comes too close to coming off as too cold. Vicki Lewis also does okay as Persephone, as does Rosario Dawson as Artemis. Marg Helgenberger completely phones it in as Hera, but seeing as how she barely has any lines, it doesnt really matter. Oliver Platt doesnt quite pull it off as Hades. Voice acting giant and veteran Tara Strong gives an always great and versatile performance as Alexa. Nathan Fillion completely hits it out of the park as Steve Trevor, proving why he is one of the most charismatic people in the nerd circuit, bring wit and charm to the character, who also serves as a genre-savvy commentator. Alfred Molina is great as Ares, expected as he is one of my favorite villainous actors. Keri Russell does decently as Diana herself, but in my opinion, she doesnt quite have the right needed balance of kindness and toughness to her voice that Susan Eisenberg had during her tenure on Justice League.
Despite all that, this film does have some pitfalls that begin to hinder it as they pile up. For example, its never explained exactly or where Ares army of men and monsters came from, let alone his modern-day Cult of Ares that somehow survived from antiquity. As with any new interpretation, the designs of the Greek gods can vary wildly, although only 2 are given any real screen time. Ares is just fine, but they really dropped the ball with Hades; I just cannot get behind that design. Hes way less James Woods and way too much Jabba the Hutt, and yes, that is as bad as it sounds. This film shows a subpar sense of space and time. Were not really given much a frame for how much time has passed in the story, and characters just show up in locations with no explanation. How did Ares get an entire army of mythological creatures up to the steps of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. without anyone noticing or doing anything about it? Furthermore, the Amazons home of the island of Themyscira is never given a definitive geographical location. I would assume its somewhere in Mediterranean Sea near Greece, but then how could Steve Trevor pilot a fighter jet to there from D.C. and back in a matter of minutes? Or how could the Amazon sail from there to D.C. in wooden ships and not take 6 months? A lot falls apart in the climax, and with its location of Washington D.C. and an army of Amazons, it bares resemblance to the story Amazons Attack, and that is not a good association. Although there is some good zombie nightmare fuel in the final fight, with undead Amazon warriors that are uncharacteristically agile and mobile for rotting corpses, it overall feels too rushed. The resolution, both Wonder Womans final fight with Ares and the battle in general, is too quick and nonsensical. After the big bad is defeated, Aress remaining army doesnt get finished off or even disappear; they just kind of shrug their shoulders and wander off into the landscape of the National Capitol, where Im sure theyll just fade back into the void from which they came.
Still, problems aside, this film holds up fairly well. Theres just enough baggage from the missteps to hold it back from being truly great. There is a good and fair discussion of gender roles and modern feminism, ideas that Wonder Woman was always meant to exemplify. There is great balancing act from 3rd-wave feminism, which in my opinion is largely poisonous and based in anger and vengeance, and feminisms more noble roots of equality and fairness. Overall, Wonder Woman is a good origin story for this great character, and a good base from which to start for the live-action version thats coming up. Now lets just hope they don't screw it up.",1460764800,2,6394,4.521588946459413

3684216,5,B001LK8TEM,this is an excellent origin story about wonder woman. I hope that she gets another dcu animated movie that involves her rival the cheeta.,1455753600,,137,4.75
3684217,5,B001LK8TEM,"- Wonder Woman (briefing Steve Trevor on Ares): ""Imagine a god whose sole mission is to propagate terror, to incite eternal war and fan the flames of hate. A god who won't stop until the earth's populace, Amazon and outsider alike, lies murdered in a battlefield grave.""
- Steve's response: ""You smell good.""

It'll be some years yet before the live action Wonder Woman movie comes out, so why not revisit the animated 2009 direct-to-DVD version? I'm partial to that iteration, seeing as how it's a loose adaptation of George Prez's comic book reboot in 1987, namely the epic ""Gods and Mortals"" arc. I happen to think Prez's interpretation was the most dynamic yet. He stressed the mythological aspect of Wonder Woman - the blood and guts of it - while honoring her status as a feminist icon. I love the emphasis Prez placed on the dichotomy of Diana's push for peace while remaining very much the kickass warrior. Unlike the Lynda Carter version who wasn't allowed to punch the baddies, this Wonder Woman doesn't hesitate to get her hands dirty. She wrecks people and monsters!

Countering her knack for mayhem is her guilelessness. There's an appealing innocence about her, this never more pronounced than when she steps into man's world. The film's first act develops the mythology all over again, and it's a more comprehensive retelling. In times of antiquity, it chronicles Hippolyta and her Amazonian warriors' brutal campaign against Ares, God of War, and Ares's subsequent defeat and imprisonment in the bowels of Themyscira, his godly powers suppressed by Hera, rendering him unable to draw from the psychic energies of war. So, only minutes in, I guess we'd seen the last of the God of War, am I right?

Follows then the familiar origin story: Diana sculpted from clay by Hippolyta and given life by Hera; cocky USAF Colonel Steve Trevor crashlanding on the hidden island of Themyscira; the contest in the arena to determine the Amazonian emissary to the world of man (and Trevor's escort back). It's a fine script penned by Michael Jelenic and Gail Simone. The modern twists and turns they inject serve to keep tuned in we jaded comic book fans familiar with what creator William Moulton Marston wrought almost 75 years ago.

The cast of voices is strong, with Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion anchoring things as the two leads. Much of the humor springs from the battle-of-the-sexes banter between Diana and a womanizing Steve Trevor. Lots of gender jokes. See Steve flirt with Diana, to her bemusement. Also, see Steve try to drink Diana under the table, key word being ""try.""

Ever wonder how the Amazons end up with an invisible plane? Don't bother. It goes unexplained. On the other hand, it's neat that we find out why Diana's costume is splashed with the star-spangled colors.

Note that characters engage in frank, adult discourse. Be aware that the violence leans toward the more graphic. There are beheadings and impalements, and Diana, in all her innocence and compelled by the tugs of sisterhood, instructs a little girl at the park in the ways of swordfighting.

I can't tell you with any confidence why Wonder Woman isn't more popular. My best guesses are that 1) she's perceived as this bland, boring superheroine, 2) it's hard to relate to her origin story, and 3) it's super-hard for a woman to cross over in a patriarchal society. I've hopes for Gal Gadot. I hope she knocks it out the park. But while we're waiting, we could do worse than check out the 2009 animated movie. It's got blood and guts. It's crammed with action and with humor. It showcases Wonder Woman at her fiercest even as it presents, on even footing, her philosophy of peace and equality and sisterhood. But she'll kick your ass in a heartbeat.",1454803200,7,3742,4.828393135725429

3684289,3,B001LK8TEM,"Thanks to the old 70's TV show, Wonder Woman has always been my favorite superhero.  And I freely admit how little I truly know about her.  Even so, I am just now getting around to watching it.  It was less than I'd hoped it would be, although I did enjoy it.

Diana (Keri Russell) has lived her life in seclusion as one of the fabled Amazons.  She is bored with her idyllic island life and wishes to explore the world of man.

She gets her chance when a man crashes his plane on their island.  That man is Steve Trevor (Nathan Fillion), and someone has to take him back to his home.

However, Ares (Alfred Molina), the Greek god of war who has been the Amazon's prisoner for centuries, uses this as a chance to escape.  Now Diana as Wonder Woman must stop him before he destroys all of Earth.  Can she, with the help of Steve, do just that?

I had never quite realized just how much Wonder Woman tied into Greek mythology, but all the references to the gods made me glad I've been reading the Percy Jackson books so I had some point of reference.

Like many origin stories, this one started slowly as they covered stuff I already knew.  Once Steve and Diana got to the real world, it started to move more quickly.  And the final battle was epic and enjoyable.

However, what wasn't enjoyable was the writing.  While some of the lines came off well, many of them felt forced and unnatural.  I'm not quite sure if it was the writing or the acting, but the voice actors didn't little to raise the material above the page.  The exception was Nathan Fillion, who managed to make Steve the more real character in the movie.

And that's probably one reason why the relationship between Steve and Diana works so well.  More than anything, it is the best part of the movie and gives us some good laughs.  Along the way, we get a look at the Amazon perception of men and the parts that are right and the parts that are wrong.  Frankly, I liked that aspect as well.

The animation is passable, but it's cheap and obviously made by the TV animation division at Warner.  There's nothing flawed with it, but it's not going to blow you away.

Take the PG-13 rating seriously.  It's rather violent most of the way through.  Don't just sit your kids down to watch this, but watch it first.

And really, that's the case with the entire movie.  It's fine for what it is, but it's not going to be something that Wonder Woman fans love.  We'll have to keep waiting for an awesome portrayal of our super heroine.",1432684800,,2491,4.352173913043479

3684315,4,B001LK8TEM,"At first I had reservations about seeing this movie because I heard some negative reviews about it from other Amazon users. But after seeing some clips on YouTube, I decided to give the film a chance and I rented it on Instant Video. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it.

Now this doesn't mean I have some issues with the story. Steve Trevor is a bit of a sexist pig but one scene with him involving the source of his cockiness will give you a chuckle. Another problem is that once Diana meets Etta Candy, they immediately dislike each other whereas in the comics, Etta has been Diana's most trusted companion for years. It's also a shame that WW doesn't interact with more women in Patriarch's world. By the end of the movie (SPOILER ALERT) she's moving in with Steve. I was hoping she could resolve her differences with Etta and move in with her or come into contact with Julia Kapatelis and she'd take Diana under her wing.

But enough with the negative, on to the positive. I've always been fascinated with Amazons and I love any story that explores the Amazonian legends by portraying them as an actual civilization with laws, celebrations, culture, politics and religion. This film does not drag it's feet when it
comes to that. I also like the fact that the villain they chose was a god instead of the ready-to-go-to Cheetah. I love that one of the females Diana interacts with is a little black girl who's sad because the boys won't let her play pirates with them, so Diana teaches her how to fight with a sword properly. It's this same little girl that sees her launch into action and calls her Wonder Woman.

I could mention more positive aspects of the film but I'd give away too much. This is definitely a film I would add to my DC animation collection.",1422316800,5,1766,4.5125

As a child care provider, raising hundreds of children from infancy to pre-adolescence, I am especially aware of how much a woman super hero means to young girls.

What I want most is to have many Wonder Woman movies, as many as Batman or Flash.

3684354,4,B001LK8TEM,"I picked this up after a discussion about the role Wonder Woman might play in the upcoming Batman vs Superman live-action film, and I have to say it was satisfying to see her in the spotlight.

2009's Wonder Woman animated feature presents us with what has become the lifeblood of superhero adaptations, namely origin stories. The set-up prior to Diana's birth does a great job of establishing the grudge between the Amazons and Ares, as well as give us a first taste of one of the highlights of the film: its action sequences. With mainly fists flying or swords and spears clashing, the fights in Wonder Woman are high-impact and surprisingly brutal at times. From there we transition into the modern era, where the story begins in earnest. Diana is characterized well in terms of having a mix of traits, some easily related to and some that make her a fish-out-of-water in modern society. Keri Russell does a great job voicing her. I liked the dynamic between Diana and Trevor, with special attention to their conversation inside and outside the bar about midway through the film where they call each-other out on their respective misandry and misogyny, marking a turning point in their relationship.

While the digital cel animation looks just fine in the film, the CGI work done for the fighter jets in Trevor's introductory scene, as well as the Invisible Jet, are a bit awkward. The film can also feel a bit rushed at times, like they were working to cram in a miniseries worth of script into the film's running time. Despite those issues, they didn't mar my experience enough that I don't think a continuation of this feature is worthwhile. On the contrary, I'd love to see the creative team get together again to explore the next chapter in Wonder Woman's exploits.",1403740800,6,1773,4.790849673202614

3684360,5,B001LK8TEM,"I have purchased a number of animated films from both DC and Marvel and I have to say that this one is probably the top of the heap. The story is solid and at 74 minutes, the movie doesn't feel like it is too long. Basically an origin story, the movie focuses on Wonder Woman as a teen before she takes on the red, gold and blue. Basic story: Steve Trevor crashes on Themyscira and one of the Amazons has to take him back to the real world so a contest is held to find the most worthy and Diana wins, however as the contest is being held Ares (the God of War) escapes from the Amazons so Diana has to both take back Steve Trevor and recapture Ares. It is refreshing that DC put out a film without Superman or Batman and I applaud the effort. There is quite a bit tossed in regarding female equality including a rather humorous exchange between Diana and a young girl as Diana teaches her sword fighting. The extras are fair with the ones on the first disc being repeats of previews of other DC releases that show up on a bunch of the other DC releases. The second disc has 2 pretty detailed documentaries on Wonder Woman with various artists, writers and directors input. If you find this at a fair price like I did pick it up....you won't be sorry.",1399680000,,1249,4.2301255230125525

3684363,5,B001LK8TEM,"In light of the terrible movies DC Animation has put out recently (eg. Justice League: War), they would really
be doing themselves a favor by going back and revisiting some of the movies they produced in the not so distant
past. Wonder Woman is one of them. The movie is superb in just about every aspect, from the the fluid. gorgeous
animation to the dramatic, rousing soundtrack,
  There are just so many elements of this movie that I love. Lets us begin with the voice acting, which is superb: Kerri Russell plays the role of a much younger Wonder Woman (in her early 20s),and she does so convincingly (this is not Susan Eisenberg's supremely confident WW, but rather a younger WW who is cautiously starting to find her place in the world); Nathan Fillon is great as Steve Trevor, playing the character with great charm and infectious humor; but the true revelation here Alfred Molina, whos steal every scene he is in as the mighty and arrogant God of War Ares. The story is wonderful, tracing the origins of Wonder Woman  and her departure from Themascira into wider world beyond. The story has a lot of wry, humorous moments (that all work), some brillant, fast paced action scenes, and some interesting observations on the plight of women in the modern world and their relationships with men (which come naturally to WW, being an outsider). The art and animation is so beautiful you almost feel moved by it in some places, and makes you realize how much the animation DC has put out recently has degenerated into poor quality Anime junk. And then the soundtrack, like in a all great movies, is lush, rousing, and, most of all, memorable -- you don't forget it ten minutes after seeing the movie.
  My only complaint with the movie? That there was no sequel. Instead, despite the commerical success of this movie and the almost unanimous praise by critics, DC Animation decides to meekly return to its tested and tired old formula: more Batman movies. Batman live action, Batman animation, Batman TV series, Batman until you want to puke.
  This is without a doubt one of the greatest animated movies ever made. Up there with the great Disney classics like Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin and Mulan. Bruce Timm and other powers at DC need to go back and revisit this movie and others made in the same era (like Green Lantern First Flight). Maybe it will help DC to right its ship and get to back to producing fine quality Animated features.",1398124800,,2438,4.695550351288056

It had a lot more graphic violence and a few more adult elements than the Justice League TV series, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids under ten unless you've checked it out first to see what your family's comfort level is with severed limbs, decapitation, and cartoon blood. Fight scenes were exciting and portrayed Wonder Woman in a powerful manner. The character of Steve Trevor, voiced by Nathan Fillion, was an amusing take on the cocky hotshot pilot, and even if we didn't buy the romantic appeal, he grew on us as the story unfolded. Wonder Woman's fish out of water manners as she tried to understand the modern world was fun, and garnered more than a few laughs. She delivered some great lines.

I enjoy this Animation far more than the 3D weird looking computerized crap which would of ruined the girls' looks.

Pixar etc makes people look Pudgy!

Btw, the true Artist who draw & write stories should be paid more than the voice characters.

Nobody cares who is playing a voice role & companies are wasting money.

Hollywood needs to stop making superstars out of nobodies. Anyone can act or do a voice role, ever see children?!

Actors are just liars. Actors should be hired one time & disposed of.

There's Millions of people to choose from & people can constantly be cycled through. Keeping costs down.

The people are stupid letting jokester entertainers get paid more than Doctors! Especially voice recorded singers that cant sing & need editing enhancement like Gay Justin B. & Weirdo Ashley S. Majority of them can't sing & fools make them rich!

When you pay someone more per hour for their time than you make per hour, you value their time more than yours! Entertainers weren't paid in the King days, they did it to spare their life.
You should only value anothers time more than yours when they're saving your life or saving your freedom!

People complain its expensive to see a Dr who went to college 8+ years yet they wanna pay someone to make them smile!  Sports games, concerts, car racing, comedy=waste of money.

Go watch a high schooler perform instead whom has no incentive to lose & puts on a show for fun.

As other reviewers have said, its definitely more for teens and adults, the scenes of violence on the battlefield (arrows entering bodies, blood, and beheading) and of Amazons bathing in the stream while being spied on by Fillion's character (no nudity though, their long hair and the water cover the bathing suit areas) made sure of that fairly early in the film.

I thought the story was good and the characters seemed very well developed rather than stereotypical and average.

I feel like in writing her there's always a desire to be incredibly PC, and not give her any flaws, for fear of being seen as sexist.  Furthermore, it often feels like its impossible to tell a Wonder Woman story that isn't about gender dynamics.  The closest they come to giving Diana a flaw in this movie is ""she distrusts men.""

Contrast that with, for example, Raven (basing this more on the Teen Titans tv show, because I haven't read alot of Titans comics).  A female superhero, who struggles with her evil side, has flaws, is quick to anger, and the fact that she's female is far from her single defining character trait.

There were definitely continuity issues...the crown kept changing shape, Ares was a god who could be killed???, Steve can fly the invisible plane, WW's strength keeps changing, etc.  This is definitely NOT a children's cartoon.

Interesting origin stories, a very creative birth story for Diana/Wonder Woman, and an intelligent mixing of Greek mythology with DC lore make this film a surprisingly interesting tale.  The action is creative, full of twists, and pretty brutal--so the film is also quite thrilling.  Up until the last scene, you want to keep watching.  Very good pacing.

3684424,5,B001LK8TEM,"This is one of the best DC Universe videos that the Warner Brothers animation studio has produced. It is a retelling of the origin of Paradise Island, of the Amazons, and of Diana, Wonder Woman. The animation is very good, the portrayal of Wonder Woman spot on, the action and battle sequences are superb, and there is even a sense of humor that runs throughout the movie, e.g.:

 Ares: You seem as eager to meet me on the battlefield as you once did in the bedroom, Hippolyta.

Hippolyta: I only hope you prove more skilled in this arena, Ares.

The movie opens with a battle between the Amazons and the forces of Ares, God of War, with Queen Hippolyta in full armor leading the way. I found it a bit refreshing, actually, to see Hippolyta really kicking butt and not just being regal and queenly. In the confrontation with Ares, we find that Ares raped her and forced her to bear a son, a son who is now killing everyone he sees on the battlefield. Hippolyta sees her sisters killed in battle and, enraged, she attacks her own son, decapitating him. Ares attacks her in turn but is overcome. Hippolyta is set to kill Ares but is stopped by Zeus and Hera. In return for sparing Ares, Hippolyta is given Paradise Island and is also given charge of Ares, to imprison him forever.

We next see Hippolyta sculpting the figure of a baby out of sand, anointing it with her own blood, and praying to the gods to bring the baby to life. Thus is born Diana, daughter of Hippolyta, Wonder Woman. We cut to years later, with Diana a grown woman, dueling with her peers, eager for new challenges. She finds such a challenge when pilot Steve Trevor's plane is shot down and he ejects, landing on the island. He is captured by Diana, after which Hippolyta decides that the time has come to resume contact with the outside world. She hosts a tournament to select the fittest Amazon to be the ambassador but forbids Diana from entering that tournament, sending her instead to guard Ares. A masked Diana secretly enters the tournament and wins.

Hippolyta gives Diana her costume, tiara, wristbands, and lasso but the celebration of victory is shortlived, as the news reaches the Amazons of a betrayal and of the escape of Ares. Diana is given an added assignment: to return Steve Trevor and to stop Ares. After some amusing incidents of Diana's culture shock on her first exposure to man's world, Steve and Diana are attacked by a servant of Ares. After defeating him, Diana and Steve track down Ares, finding him attempting to open the gates to Tartarus. Steve and Diana fail to stop Ares and Diana is injured in the process.

The portrayal of Hades is one of my biggest gripes about the movie, as he is displayed as an effete, obese, toga-clad Emperor Nero lookalike instead of a powerful Lord of the Underworld, one of the most powerful gods in the pantheon. He agrees to help Ares and frees him from the wristbands attached to him by Zeus that were robbing him of his power. Freed, Ares assembles his army and descends on Washington, D.C., attempting to start a war to end all wars, giving himself unlimited power, power enough to not only conquer mankind but to conquer the very gods themselves. I've omitted some sub-plots and there are several plot twists before all is said and done, with some frightening moments as Ares grows in power, endangering all that lives. The final ending? I'm sure that you can guess.

Overall, this was a very solid, very entertaining effort. There is humor here but very little ""camp."" The voice acting is very good, with Alfred Molina, Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, and Virginia Madsen, as Ares, Diana, Steve, and Hippolyta, respectively, all doing bang-up jobs. The story is well done, with a good mix of quiet moments, humor, tenderness, and action, and some very good interaction between Steve and Diana, as Diana realizes that men aren't quite what she thought they were, good or bad. Very entertaining and well worth your time.",1391472000,,3956,4.649499284692418

I love the story, I love the inclusion of the mythology, I love the witty lines and dialogue, and I love the characters and relationships between them. I've heard many say that Wonder Woman couldn't handle her own live action movie? And watching this I just think ""Seriously?"" Because this, if they did a live action movie, like Green Lantern for example, they should do it like this, and like the first animated Green Lantern movie (the one prior to Emerald Knights, although I did enjoy that one too and found the background and stories on the other characters fun and interesting).

Other than that, it's an interesting look into the world of the Amazons on Themyscira as well as a engaging story of how and why Wonder Woman had to visit the outside world.

The origin story's a little different than the various versions in the comics, but fairly close, and adapted well to fit the goal and pacing of the storyline.

3684452,3,B001LK8TEM,"Not a bad origins story - just not a great one. While many wouldn't catch the Greek/Roman name mixtures, many do these days and it's just annoying/distracting. And as a guy, I wish Steve had been portrayed in a more modern light, than as a watered down Top Gun winged warrior.

Invisibility is often associated with superhuman powers - why limit it to Diana's aircraft? (which was never explained).

Pretty good pacing, nice voice work, decent graphics, but the story line could have been more complicated or updated. The director already chose an upgrade in violence - why not an upgrade in intelligence too?",1389052800,,609,4.846153846153846

It is there for enjoyment.
The storyline triggers on every point that is Wonder Woman. The mythology that connects the Amazons to the Gods. The use of Ares God of War. Well done.

I've read the comics for nearly forty years now and this one addresses some of the sexism of the ancient Greek era and today. It depicts Diana as a warrior (which is necessary) and as a stranger in ""Man's world"". The feelings of being out place and her first encounters with males, proved to be on point, given her all female, Amazon upbringing.
I can only hope that any live action Wonder Woman film borrows heavily from this animated film.",1387324800,2,543,4.494949494949495

3684477,5,B001LK8TEM,"This story is a wonderful origin story of Wonder Woman, the usage of mythology adds a complexity that caters to both young and adult alike.  The story is full of depth, which makes it highly entertaining.  Though the characterization is limited to a smaller scope, it is enough for the plot to work.  I would of liked more, but it was still a well executed story.

3684497,5,B001LK8TEM,"Warner Brothers and other movie studios should look to this movie as how to make a stand alone Wonder Woman movie!  If they were to pair this Wonder Woman with the New 52 Superman after they do Superman/Batman then they would continue on with the hits and set themselves up well for a Justice League movie that would rival the Avengers.

They stuck to the comic book history, they updated Steve Trevor and the military with today's weaponry, and they showed that the Amazon race can fight and put them in a believable scenario with Ares.  Very clean movie with no cursing (something I really appreciated as a parent), something Warner Brothers Premiere studios could learn from and hopefully will start removing from their animated movies (no need for the cursing and it would improve sales and allow parents to share their love of the characters with their children).

I know the movie did not sell well but I do hope they follow up with another movie in the future.  Perhaps they could merge with Superman from Warner Premiere and start a New 52 series animated style!!",1381795200,,1071,4.705882352941177

Stoic, serious, joyless and defensive.  Of course, they all hate men as well.  By the time the story takes a turn towards reconciliation for the Amazons and men, it is very late in the film.  Let's be honest - the only likable character here is Steve Trevor.  While he isn't perfect, he is authentic which is more than one can say about anyone else in this picture.

My biggest issue with this movie is the romance between that pilot and Diana. That was crap and the only you out that in was because she's a lady. That is one of the reasons I am afraid for a Wonder Women series cause they will make it bout her running after some dude. While she wasn't running after him in this movie it was forced just because.

This is yet another retelling of Wonder Woman's Origin story that assumes the viewer knows absolutely nothing about Wonder Woman. Slight problem being that as a direct-to-video release with little to no marketing, there pretty much wasn't going to be anybody buying this film that wasn't already either a Comic Book Fan, or a DC Animated Universe fan. Ergo the dialog is cheesy, the plot predictable, most of the characters forgettable, and the action a bit stale.

Granted a bit of research shows that some of the action was edited or outright cut to gain a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating. Right off hand, DC should have published the original version as an Unrated edition; but that's not what made this particular movie a 4 star watch.

Nathan Fillion gives this film a star just by... There's no way to get around the voice acting. Nathan spends the whole film reading his lines as Mal from Firefly. The result is boring and predictable lines... delivered by somebody whom is actually caring about their performance. Fair enough I think Keri Russel was pushed as well just to try and match Nathan's acting... Alfred Molina as Ares's though?  Well, let's just say that he's no Kevin Todd Smith.",1375747200,3,1312,4.770925110132159

The story of the Amazons in DC Universe is not easy to tell because it can either swing towards ultra feminism where no men need be involved or they just neglect that stuff and Amazons are just enlightened warrior women. This took the idea of feminism in comics and presented it with a balanced tone. The character development was well done and nothing felt forced, although there was some convenience in certain scenes but those could be forgiven for the sake of this not becoming a 3-hour long film.

Overall great stuff! I definitely recommend it. It's right up there for me with Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, Batman: Under the Red Hood, and The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1&2 for some of the best stuff to come from DC Animation.",1375660800,,878,4.664516129032258

Now this story isn't quite by favorite interpretation but it was great none the less. The action was some of the best you will see in most animated films outside anime. I am a huge Wonder Woman fan I would reccomend this to even someone with no knowledge about the character. The story is deep enough and has momentum that will have you entertained for sure. As you may know Diana has more than one orgin story but this is a great job on one of them. Some people don't like how they had to have a main male figure since it may seem sexist but Diana's strong persona and morales ultimately still do justice over that issue. She does become attracted to him which isn't right in true story but still doesn't make this movie any less than what it is.

3684559,3,B001LK8TEM,"Pros:
  Strong story, maturely and boldly told.
  Very dramatic with little or no comic book gloss.

Cons:
  Only OK animation.  However, its clean style makes up for some of the lack of detail.
  Huge story holes and plot skipping.  Not normally a bad thing in a comic, but I think a little more story would have been better.
  Voice acting was only so-so, occasionally doing a little better.
  [mild spoilers coming]
  The constant man hating got to be a little much pretty early.  Yes, I know they are Amazons.  Yes, I know they have strong feelings about men.  Yes, I know Ares is a man.  However, the constant male put downs and remarks not to mention the poor little girl who was being ""oppressed"" by the mean boys was just too much.  I wasn't really offended, I just thought it wasn't Wonder Woman.  Wonder Woman is much more fair and intelligent than this movie shows.  No matter what happens, Wonder Woman is on it and she knows what to do.  She is a lot like Superman in that regard.  She can get mad, but it never messes up what she is doing.  And, yes, I know she is less experienced in dealing with the outside world but she is not less experienced in dealing with other people. She also would never kick a man in the groin, because it wouldn't be honorable, any more than she would stab someone in the back.  There was some male/female compromise at the end, but only by having Wonder Woman act like a bimbo??  I could say more, but think that is enough.

Overall, I wouldn't put it on a list of super hero movies to watch.",1375056000,2,1537,4.328621908127208

I however disagree, while characters like Ironman and Thor reign as king of the box offices. They lack in the animation department. These animated videos from DC are some of the most amazing and entertaining things I've watched in a long time. This video in particular deals with the Wonder Woman origin story so well that they could simply make an entire live action movie with the same plot and I wouldn't raise a peep. She is introduced as strong and courageous, while showing she can be gentle and play just a fiercely...maybe even more so than her male counterparts. The problem most people have with adapting Wonder Woman is they try to just focus on beauty and so she gets type cast as some skinny ditzy looking air head that couldn't possibly handle herself in a real fight.

I hope Wonder Woman receives a sequel or even a stand alone series.

The music in this film is phenomenal, especially the music that plays during the end credits. Christopher Drake is the composer and he is simply a genius. I seriously consider him as being on the same level as Hans Zimmer. I also love the writing of this film. Gail Simone has been the authority on writing comics such as Wonder Woman and Batgirl for a long time and she comes through again with a GREAT story for this film. Michael Jelenic also deserves credit for this great writing and script.

This movie does her justice though, by filling out the backstory that I did not know.  In this movie, she is a valkyrie-ish demigoddess from a isolationist sapphos-like island whereupon she learned to beat up men with her super strength and skills, apparently.  When her island is threatened, as is the rest of the world, it becomes time for her to leave the island and join other superheroes in battle.  While Superman gets to fly around and punch things because that is all he does and he's never had to learn karate, it's nice to have a show that holds Wonder Woman up as his equal, making up in skill and smarts what she lacks in his strength.

I thought this was a great and entertaining dvd. There's a good mix of action and humor, and the running time was just right. Keri Russell does a wonderful job in the title role. Nathan Fillion is perfect as Steve Trevor, and Aflred Molina is great as Ares. The second dvd was also enjoyable with two features and two episodes from the Bruce Timm Justice League cartoons.

My problems came mostly at the end.  The entire Amazonian island is done in ancient Greek, yet Wonder Woman's jet was ultra modern.  A simple explanation of any sort would have sufficed, but the lack of explanation pulled me out of the story a bit.  At one point an American flies in her plane and all the displays are in English -again, everything was Greek up to this point -another simple explanation was all that was needed.

At one point an army lands on the rocky shores of the Potomac right next to the Capital building in D.C. -of course there is no large rocky beach on the Potomac mere yards from the Capital building.  At another point a nuclear missile launches from somewhere visable from the White House, which, based off the movie means there is a missile silo on the outskirts of D.C.

Some might cry foul that I am complaining over minor points, but the first two-thirds of the movie are so much better written than the last third that it is worth mentioning.  It seemed like they hurried things and it shows.

My final point: no Justice League!  There was a HUGE opportunity to tie them in somehow.  America's capital is invaded by the god of war and massive army out of myth and legend...

3684616,4,B001LK8TEM,"Being a longtime fan of the superhero genre, and in particular of the ""Timmverse"" TV shows in the 90s, I've been going through the DC Universe Animated Original Movies lately with relish. By breaking the homogenous mold of the DCAU, sometimes they do something that knocks it out of the park (my favorite so far has been Crisis on Two Earths, and its successor Young Justice), and sometimes the results are more mixed. I mostly enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie, but I'd have to put it in the ""mixed"" column. There's a lot that works about it, but also a lot of things that just don't.

I imagine the pitch for this movie being something like this: ""Batman and Superman have gotten big-budget live-action revivals. But a movie for Wonder Woman, third member of the DC triumvirate, just can't get off the ground. So the heck with it, let's make something on the order of Batman Begins or Superman Returns, only animated instead of live action.""

It's a good idea. And the movie is the most fully-realized adult-oriented animation I've seen to come out of DC since Mask of the Phantasm. (That's a good thing.)  But, much like the subsequent Under the Red Hood, Wonder Woman's attempt at adult themes is hamstrung by the marketing imperative to sell this video to young kids. The end result is a laughable series of scenes where people are hacked, pierced, and decapitated with swords, spears, and arrows, yet there's barely a drop of blood. On two occasions someone gets skewered point-to-hilt with a sword, yet afterward the blade is clearly shown to be spotless. Ok. So is this adult-oriented animation or not?

At the same time, Wonder Woman and sidekick/love interest Steve Trevor have little problem killing. Maybe I'm just used to Batman, writers for whom have made a cottage industry of having their cake and eating it too, generally avoiding the application of lethal force in even his most adult incarnations. But it's jarring to see Diana and Steve neck-snapping and headshotting thugs right and left. Some of this is ameliorated by the fact that some of their foes are mythological beasties who may or may not be real. But the human henchmen get it too. I'm pretty sure that even if this were a live-action film, I'd find this out of place. You definitely wouldn't see it in a Batman or Superman movie.

The ill-defined nature of Ares' henchbeasts brings me to my second big problem with this movie, which is that the writers have created this new universe from a mish-mash of different elements, and little if any thought seems to have been given to how they work together. Let's start with Wonder Woman herself.

Depictions of Wonder Woman's powers have varied widely. On one end of the spectrum you have the Super Friends version, who was basically an athlete with a magic lasso. Then you have DCAU Wonder Woman, who could slug it out with Superman. Linda Carter's Wonder Woman seemed to be somewhere in between. Here, rather than create any sort of bible for this new Wonder Woman, the writers have taken the annoying route of making up her powers as they went along. So you start with the Amazons, who seem to be just normal human women, albeit ageless thanks to a consolation spell from the gods. Then you have Diana, who is the best warrior on Themyscira, but otherwise apparently human, judging by the fact that she and Steve seem physically evenly matched in their initial encounter. If her costume gives her any special powers above the other Amazons, it's never stated or hinted at--yet later in the film she's being thrown through concrete walls without a scratch. And can she fly? Probably not, but at one point in the film she's pounding Ares in the face while hovering in the air, so who knows.

Then you have the Amazon culture. It's explicitly stated that they have no contact with or interest in the outside world. Wonder Woman's costume is created to mimic America's stars and stripes, yet it's implied that they got the design from the patch on Steve's uniform and they don't actually know the USA from any other country. The famous ""bullets and bracelets"" scene is even redone with ordinary bows and arrows to hammer home their lack of technology. Yet when Wonder Woman and Steve prepare to leave the island, boom, high-tech invisible fighter jet outta nowhere!

From there, it gets worse. Ares' powers and weaknesses are even more ill-defined and plot-driven than Wonder Woman's. Wonder Woman takes down like 10 shots of tequila while remaining stone cold sober, which is waved off as her being ""an Amazon warrior."" The Amazons can build the invisible jet but are consigned to travel in primitive wooden sailing ships... that are somehow able to cross from Themyscira to the US in a matter of minutes... and travel up the Potomac River completely undetected. And during the climactic battle where Amazons and Ares' forces duke it out in the National Mall, it's left to our imaginations why people wielding spears and shields pose such a problem to American military forces armed with guns and bombs.

The plot is ok, an impressive canvas similar to what you'd find in a live-action superhero movie, but it has problems. In the first scene, we see the legions of generic Amazons we're accustomed to seeing in Wonder Woman stories. But then suddenly they start throwing individual characters in peril at us, and it's all so rushed and confusing. Hey, everyone seems to hate that bookish girl--am I supposed to like her? Oh, she got killed--am I supposed to care? These characters needed a bit more fleshing out to make them work, and they don't get it.

Also skimped on is Ares' son Thrax (you're excused if you watched the movie and didn't remember his name; I had to look it up), who is a major component of the villain's emotional arc, yet thanks to his now-you-see-it-now-you-don't screen presence, it's impossible to care. In general I'm a fan of stories which seem to start in the middle, but there is just way more piled into the first scene of this movie than it can sustain.

My biggest problem with this movie, however, is its repugnant evopsych take on gender roles. Fedora-wearing ""nice guy"" comic book nerds aren't really known for their socially enlightened views (case in point: Frank Miller). And Wonder Woman in particular can be a sore spot, an icon of female empowerment that originated in her male creator's bondage fantasies, and tends to be used as cheap wish fulfillment by her male writers and illustrators. Generally speaking, if you want to insert social messages into a commercial piece like this without looking like a total schmuck, you focus on the shortcomings of the hegemon. Instead, the writers of this movie decided it was important to teach Diana and Hippolyta that women are incomplete without children, and that chauvinism is actually cool. Honestly, I don't have a problem with confirmed man-pig Steve Trevor speechifying to Wonder Woman that all men aren't pigs--there's such a thing as irony, and the fact that a society isn't defined by one member is obviously a theme--but the whole ""men open doors for women, it's biology"" thing would have been anachronistic in a cartoon from the 1970s. In 2009, it's just sad. I don't care where this material was adapted from, these people really should have known better.

The last scene depicts Wonder Woman successfully domesticated into Steve Trevor's perfect little waifu. Aside from some lingering gender role swapping for comedic effect, it's total MRA wish fulfillment, and the fact that some reviewers here are complaining about the movie being ""feminist"" or ""misandrist"" is mind-boggling to me. How much spoonfeeding do you need?

So obviously I had some problems with this film. But there's also a lot to like. The animation is gorgeous, downright Disney-like at times, well worth the price of the disc. The character designs are really interesting, vivid but different from the animation models used for the other DC movies. Wonder Woman's design has a lot of character and is actually not in-your-face attractive, contrasting from the bland beauty of her Super Friends, DCAU, or Batman: The Brave and the Bold depictions, a unique artistic choice in this genre. Paradise Island is depicted like, well, paradise; even the underground prison has a bucolic beauty.

The voices are excellent (although Alfred Molina sounds so much like Guy Gardner at times, I had to wonder if Diedrich Bader had filled in for him in ADR). And there are some nice character moments, like Steve saving the day in Wonder Woman's jet (he's a pilot--makes perfect sense!).

As you can tell by my four-star rating, I enjoyed this film overall, and I strongly recommend it to DC fans. But just be aware that there are major flaws, and depending on how forgiving you are, the plot holes, inconsistent tone, and knuckle-dragger social stance may really rub you the wrong way.",1369612800,,8865,4.842244224422442
3684620,1,B001LK8TEM,"I admit that I haven't read many Wonder Woman comics (and especially not recent ones,) but I'm familiar with the character and her core supporting cast, and what made the concept work during its initial run.  It's for these reasons that I have to point out just what a miserable failure this movie was, in virtually every respect.  ""Wonder Woman"" is a load of pushy, overly-violent, trash-talking, modern American feminism, and nothing else.  However, I feel it deserves a more thorough review than just that, so for the rest of the review, I'll be addressing the specific characters and other elements in the movie, to explain just why the film gets them wrong.

-----

Etta Candy

Etta Candy is a minor character in the film.  So minor, in fact, that she gets, I think, less than a minute of screen-time.  In fact, it makes me wonder why they even bothered to put her in, if they couldn't do a better job on her than this.

In this film, Etta is a tall, blond, skinny, seductive woman, who's briefly scolded by Wonder Woman for asking a man to move a desk for her.

In the comics, Etta Candy was a short, plump, bruinette, who was the leader of a college sorority.  Wonder Woman discovered her when she was sickly and weak while visiting a local hospital.  In other words, Etta was unearthed on an errand of mercy; not a manhunt for an enemy, as in this film.

I'm just going to be up-front about this.  Making Etta skinny is something which, by itself, would put this film on my butt-kick list, but the fact that they only used her to demonstrate one of Wonder Woman's character flaws puts it way over the top.

-----

Hades

In a way, my problem with the film's depiction of Hades is almost the precise reverse of my problem with Etta Candy in one sense, and precisely the same in another sense.

In this film, Hades is a black-haired, lazy, obese man who reclines on a couch and orders people around in the underworld.  I have -never- seen him depicted this way before; not in the comics, and certainly not in any of the ancient Greek artwork that depicted him.  This is the problem which, as I said, is like the opposite of my problem with Etta.

The problem which is the same for both characters is that in neither case do the characters have motives which are even remotely similar to their original counterparts.  Hades was sentenced to rule the underworld by Zeus, to keep him busy, and it apparently worked, as Hades is generally depicted as fearsome, but always a very busy guy.  Yet, in this film, he's apparently not busy, not working, not really fearsome at all, and not the least bit worried about all the extra work he'll have to do when Ares starts killing people.  In fact, he seems to -want- more people to die.

This depiction just made no sense to me.  My conclusion here is that it was just done to avoid having to go too deep into the character, and to prey on the already-miserable fat-person stereotypes, just as a faithful rendering of Etta would have threatened them.

-----

Steve Trevor

Up to now, we've been dealing mainly with bit players, but I don't think any character does quite as much damage to this movie as Steve Trevor.  In the comics, he was a brave, WWII fighter pilot, who was rescued by Wonder Woman and returned home.  She stayed on as a goodwill ambassador to ""man's world,"" and the two eventually fell in love.  Steve was a little awkward at times, in the comics, but he was a decent man nonetheless.

In the movie, Steve is -not- a decent man.  He's a filthy, womanizing, letcherous, drunken buffoon.  Yes, he can fight pretty well in his own way, but that's just about all he brings to the film, and given that he's playing alongside a superheroine, that means he's basically a worthless character, serving only to give Wonder Woman a reason to visit man's world, and get her into trouble.

But I think I know why they did him this way.  You see, midway through the film, Steve delivers a long and perfectly-accurate speech about how Wonder Woman needs to back off suspecting men of being patronizing every time they do something nice for a woman (she has a nasty habit, in this movie, of taking it as an insult whenever this happens.)  It's a good speech, and coming from, for example, a Sir Galahad or a Superman, it would have been one of the high points of the film, because it would have refuted, once and for all, the prejudices of the Wonder Woman character, and pointed out just what a jerk she was, and had always been, since the film began.

However, the speech loses all of its steam, because, of course, we know that it's coming from a filthy, womanizing, letcherous, drunken buffoon, and in the eyes of modern men, if you're ""that kind of person,"" then any point you make must be a bad one.  This, I think, is why they went to such lengths to keep Steve Trevor from being a decent human being, or a good representative of the male gender, as he was in the comics.  It's because they want that message crushed.

-----

Ares

The villain of the piece is Ares; the Greek god of war, who's been imprisoned on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira for ages, and is seeking a way to restore his powers, so that he can challenge the powers that be.  Ares comes across as being very much like Imhotep from the 1999 version of ""the Mummy;"" an immensely-powerful and threatening villain, who's seeking forbidden means to make himself even stronger through murder and general evil.

Sadly, of all the characters in this film, he's probably the closest to his depiction in the comics and legends, with one exception.  Even once he ""gets his powers back,"" he still seems to be mortal.  The one constant thing about the legends of the Greek gods was that whether or not they could fight, they were immune to all forms of conventional attack.  This is a -big- flaw in the film.  However, I'll cover this more in a couple sections, when I get to Wonder Woman herself.

-----

The Amazons

In the past, I've seen two basic depictions of the amazons; Wonder Woman's people.  First, there's the type that remains separate from ""man's world"" as a sort of religious devotion.  Second, there's the type that genuinely thinks of humans as inferior, and men especially so.  Needless to say, I favor the former over the latter, since an island full of intensely self-righteous and condescending jerks is hardly a proud heritage for a great superheroine.

However, the amazons in this movie take things even further than the worst comic writing I've seen about them.  Not only are they totally convinced of their own superiority, but they practice active prejudice against men, and teach hatred of all men as though it were a religious doctrine.  This is bad enough, but it's not the only problem the amazons have.

You see, it's revealed that this isolation from human beings is not by choice; that the amazons have adopted a life without families or children, with the exception of Diana, who was made from clay, and that they really have only two things in exchange; well-honed warrior disciplines, and the wisdom of ancient books.

I say that these are the only things they have because these amazons are war-hounds and little else.  One of them is shown enjoying books, but even she turns into a battle-thrall near the end of the film, and at no point in the film are the amazons shown to be honest, good-hearted, or moral.  In fact, as far as I can tell, these amazons have no form of moral teaching, though they're perfectly eager to criticize things that offend their emotional sensibilities.  Needless to say, I was singularly unimpressed with the amazons in this movie, and everything about them, and it seems that...

-----

Wonder Woman Herself

...has learned from them well.  Like them, she's a rabid man-hater and mindless battle-hound, and like them, she's constantly looking down her nose at things she finds emotionally-offensive, while demonstrating no clear, moral understanding at all.

In the original comics, Wonder Woman was a brave, strong woman who fought crime and evil with her special powers, but she was also a caring, gentle soul, more akin to Mother Theresa than Xena; Warrior Princess.  She loved helping people out when they were in danger, or needed assistance, whether it involved fighting someone or not.  It was by no means rare to see her carrying someone to a hospital, or transporting medicine to victims of a plague; all the time with a smile on her face, because she knew she was helping someone.  No other reason was needed.

On top of all that, Wonder Woman was genuinely virtuous; -in the Christian sense- of virtues.  She was humble, honest, charitable, joyful, loved peace, justice and righteousness, and she was as pure-hearted as a newborn.

Sadly, many writers simply don't or didn't understand this about her, and it's become something of a trend in comics to depict her as a sort of ""perfect"" character who's become imperfect because she -thinks of herself as- perfect, and superior to everyone else.

Still, as bad as this has gotten in the comics, it's even worse in this movie, which paints Wonder Woman as a genuine jerk with nothing even resembling gold in her heart.  Worst of all, this Wonder Woman is capable of murder.

Yes, I realize that she killed someone in the comics as well, under pressure and during what essentially amounted to a hostage situation.  I raise issue with that as well, but not nearly as much as with this film, because at least -that murder- was treated as a genuine, moral problem.  In this film, Wonder Woman has no qualms whatsoever with slicing apart bad guys like cucumbers, -with the intent of ending their lives.-  There is nothing in any way moral or purehearted about this character, and therefore, nothing heroic.

-----

The Whole World View of the Film

I've said my piece on feminism elsewhere (google ""the problem of feminism"" in quotes.  It's the first one that pops up,) and I feel no need to repeat it.  However, this movie has, I think, two specific problems with feminism.

1. First, Wonder Woman views the normal attitudes of a normal woman asking for help from a man as -entirely cultural.-  She insists that women can do anything which men can do, and here's the problem with that view.  It's -false.-  It's -false- that women can do whatever men can do.

Women are built differently than men.  Their upper bodies aren't designed for the same kind of strenuous, heavy lifting, their torsos aren't meant for dodging blows in combat, and they wear out faster under prolonged physical activity.  Now, granted, a certain amount of training and practice can limit these disadvantages to a certian degree, but regardless, against a male opponent of comparable skill and practice, a woman would simply find herself outclassed in many areas; usually involving physical activity.

The only reason why anyone would deny this is because Wonder Woman has superpowers, so she -is- built for heavy lifting, swift dodging, etc...  However, Wonder Woman is a fictional character, who is clearly the exception to the rule.  This is why the ancient Greeks found the amazons so humorous to tell stories about.  There was simply no way for women to overpower men in combat en masse in the real world.

This is one of the reasons why the film irks me so.  It attempts to derive its philosophy from the abilities of fictional characters, who only represent a tiny minority, even in their own home universe.

2. There have always been feminist or pseudo-feminist undertones to Woman Woman, but believe it or not, there was a time when feminism was a -good- thing; just the desire to see woman get a just wage for doing the same jobs as men.

By contrast, much of modern feminism (at least in major, feminist organizations) has become just what Wonder Woman herself demonstrates in this movie, a disorganized, disagreeable group of angry, violent individuals, united by radical sexism.

As sad as it's been to see feminism, as a cause, gradually turn into something horrible, it's been even worse seeing Wonder Woman trying to turn into something just as bad.  I guess that's all I really have to say.",1369180800,11,12125,4.668552569542668

The only complaints I have are that during the story I would have wanted to know why the choose that spot to have the final battle. They didn't say why there it kinda just happened to be that area. Would have liked some insight on why there. My other complaint is why haven't they done another wonder woman movie. I didn't even know her villians until I looked them up and I loved how they ended this movie too. So why haven't they made another film?  You have so many adventures with superman and batman and even green lantern. I would have loved at least 3 movies with wonderwoman and even the flash and some others. They did such a good job on the cast for this movie and the artistry I think it would be great for them to make a couple more. Many ppl don't know a lot about some of these characters and if no one is goin to make the effort to make them be known ( along with their villians) then why keep goin with some of these others ( batman and superman for ex) . Cause ultimatley they all end up in the league of justice. I want to see how they came to be before that point and what it took to get there.

3684631,2,B001LK8TEM,"You might have heard that the Wonder Woman television series has been in development hell for years.  There's a good reason for this, and begins with her title, ""Wonder Woman."" The days when quaintly identifying power with gender are several decades old (even D&D now refers to monsters as ""lizardfolk"" instead of ""lizardmen""), and Wonder Woman's costume has evolved to only be a little less ridiculous. She's an Amazon, living a modern world, who flies an invisible jet, and lives by a code in which men are inferior. Is she an ancient Amazon with a quaintly anachronistic view of the world or an alien from a highly advanced society with technology so advanced that it looks like magic? ""Wonder Woman"" is not interested in giving you answers.

What ""Wonder Woman"" does well is provide a mythical grounding for the character.  Wonder Woman, Diana, is basically a mythical goddess on par with Thor.  It's all the bizarre trappings that dilute her -- her weird magical lariat, the fact that she's dressed up like an American showgirl (""we made you a costume to fit in,"" say the Amazons, and that's a sadly ironic statement), or that she flies the aforementioned super jet when there appears to be no other technology on the island.

Wonder Woman (Keri Russell) isn't just a superhero, she's godlike, so her strength, endurance, etc. are unmatched.  And yet she seems perfectly comfortable in a dress and heels (although she's not afraid to complain about it) and highly suspicious of womanizing hot shots like Steve Trevor (Nathan Fillion). But that's okay, they'll probably fall in love anyway, because Wonder Woman is still playing in a boy's world.

The truth is that Wonder Woman's background doesn't lend itself to modern storytelling, and this installment does its level best to bridge the gap by smoothing over the rougher edges.  There's a running battle with Ares (Alfred Molina), the Greek Gods make an appearance, and Wonder Woman does get to show off just how physically powerful she is. But the writers aren't courageous enough to just dump some elements without messing with the continuity of the broader universe Wonder Woman and her Amazons inhabit.

Thing is, Wonder Woman is mythology-light.  She's an Amazon but doesn't wield a sword, a warrior princess but still works with men, and an anachronistic throwback but but not so outdated that she can't use technology. Until some writer courageously cuts the fat, we'll continue to end up with well-intentioned but muddled backstories like this one.",1359072000,3,2514,4.992822966507177

3684636,5,B001LK8TEM,"I didn't initially want to see this movie because like so many cartoons about super heroes I figured it would be just more of the same kinda thing.  In fact usually when you see cartoons about women heroes there is the ""added bonus"" of being able to see the hyper-sexual female form exposed through all sorts of risque angles. Usually in those cartoons its actually a man that comes in to either save the day himself, or offer guidance (because clearly a woman could never be a real super hero without some help.)

Wonder Woman kicks all kinds of ass in this movie.  She's smart, she's cunning, there's motivation and turmoil behind all of the decisions she makes AND she actually talks about gender.  She actually brings up issues of sexism and misogyny that writers wouldn't dare to put in ten years ago.

Yes she still has to wear that costume, and yeah the plot is still your basic ""good guy vs bad guy doomsday"" scenario but it still felt refreshing, like a step in the right direction.  I really hope that DC makes another one of these.",1356912000,,1042,4.51595744680851

Digging deep into the origin of Wonder Woman the film- makers have fun creating believable landscapes while holding to the mythical charms that endear us to the chracter of Wonder Woman. To put it plainly , Wonder Woman kicks a*s and does so with plain spoken angst.

The movie even dabbles in giving us Wonder Womans approach to some of todays females while holding to true femininity. Great writing all around with audio that is completely in sync.

animated version.  The story is this - Ares, God of War, has escaped from his
imprisonment on Themyscira and Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, must send a
champion to get him back.  Hippolyta holds a contest and the champion will become
Wonder Woman.  However Diana, Hippolyta's daughter wants to be the champion, but
her mother has forbidden it.  So she disguises herself and wins.  As Wonder Woman,
Diana goes to Man's World with the help of Steve Trevor, a man who has crashed on
the all-woman isle.

Excellent voice casting and a decent retelling of how Wonder Woman came to be.
However that being said, this is a revision of the Wonder Woman story, not the
one told in the comics.  I would read the comics too.  The basic elements of the
story are there.  It's PG-13.  There is a little violence and suggestive material.

3684650,5,B001LK8TEM,"This particular movie came into my collection more as an impulse buy than anything else. I found it at a rather cheap sale and decided to give it a try. Imagine my surprise that it was really quite enjoyable.

To clarify, my exposure to Wonder Woman was strictly limited to Justice League cartoons from my youth. However, this movie managed to both expand and enhance her legend beyond expectations. This Wonder Woman was still new to Mans World, ran into several of the sort of cultural problems such an immersion would cause. Her potential male lead is both chauvinistic and lecherous, but very good at what he does as both a pilot and a fighter. Therefore, the team up and eventual romance is fun to watch develop. Coupled with excellent animation and an engaging plot, this movie is definitely worth the investment of both time and money :)

However, I do have one bit of warning for the unwary. Unlike other animated versions of the figure you might have seen, this Wonder Woman does kill quite a bit, rather than fighting to subdue her enemies. For that reason alone, make sure that you don't get this DVD for an impressionable eight year old.",1352505600,,1149,4.655172413793103

I personally have been most disappointed in modern attempts to bring WW to the television. However, the WW presented in the Justice League Cartoon made for Cartoon Network was by far her best representation. I was so hoping the producers of this cartoon would use the same talent use in that series but they decided to use different art technique and voices. Although I have nothing against Keri Russell's portrayal however she was not as good as Susan Eisenberg's from the Justice League Cartoon series. The artwork was too stylized for my taste which resulted in WW losing much of her sex appeal. I was really disappointed to be sure.

The film did have good bits and it did earn its PG-13 rating due to violence and some surprisingly frank language. I also found the film somewhat anti-climatic and formulaic. I was also disappointed that unlike the Justice League cartoon, WW fell victim to the ""charms of men"". She is much more interesting when her sexuality is in question and when she isn't able to be manipulated by men that easily.

Most fans of WW and DC heroes in general will probably like this film but I find it disappointing that they had card blanche to make a really kick butt film but just produced the same old stuff done over and over.",1343779200,2,1511,4.564575645756458

3684663,5,B001LK8TEM,"I read the comic book version of the origin story many versions.  I even seen the TV show of Wonder Woman.  Even the Justice League version of her.

This is the best to-date, they took the best things I like her mother is ruthless, the invisible jet the fixed by making it invisible when the hood is closed.  They allowed the Amazons to actually kill monsters behead them even.  They are fighters truly in the sense of the word.  I thought they sort of rushed some parts but it is not long enough I think it was like 90 mins.  The Fire-Fly actor did a great job as did Keri but they gave all the zinger comments to Steve Trever.

Still liked it better than every justice league movie other than the one with the two earths that has owl man in it that is pretty good and maybe batman Mr Freeze.  I just like the comic book version of the few moments of Mr Freeze in total love of his wife, it was so well done for such a short story in batman made Arnold look foolish.

But this wonder woman was better than all the super man movies including doomsday, batman vs superman, other superman movies, green lantern all are mediocre like I was watching a Justice League episode.

This is PG-13 the be-headings, neck snapping, shots to the head, swear words, adult subjects may not be for the very small kids but it's great for rest of us.  Hope to see more like it have not seen a cartoon from DC as violent even live action like Dare Devil, Electra, extra.  That is another reason why I like this.

I put her up there with Green Lantern and Aquaman--filler heroes. If I'd known that it had the same director as Superman/Batman: Apocalypse I would have checked it out a long time ago.

Briefly, Ares, the god of war, has escaped imprisonment. Diana (Wonder Woman) with the help of a soldier set out to stop Ares from destroying the world. This is the story in a nutshell without spoiling it. The story is very good, essentially the paradigm shift of a culture governed by women and where women are the stronger sex. Wonder woman keeps it real. If you want to be a man's equal then stop shaking your b**bs and *sses and do it yourself. ""Stop subordinating yourself to men"" is Wonder Woman's outlook. But despite her superior strength and independence the film shows that all women can be soft and feminized by real men, and even seduced, conquered, and deceived, as is often the case, by bad boys.

The animation is top notch. The fight scenes are brutal and well-choreographed. This is definitely not the Saturday morning version of Wonder Woman I grew up with. These chicks kick *ass! I don't know how DC does it. As far as animation they got the market cornered right now. This is up there with the best of them so far.

There was one part that did make me shake my head a little and that was (spoiler alert!) when Ares basically screamed for Zeus to help him toward the end.

3684672,5,B001LK8TEM,"When comic fans tout on about the Main Three (including Superman and Batman), we did a double-take with the release we probably never expected to see. And it is arguably the best DCU animated feature to date.

This set has everything. Commentary on the feature, behind the scenes of the Green Lantern animated film, two huge documentaries, and the expected bonus episodes picked by DC animation expert Bruce Timm.

The film itself shatters all expectations. Keri Russell does a solid job as she has to walk a very thin line between a powerful female demigod and a humanizing of said character. We are given a reinterpretation of the origin, but it a lot more hard-hitting.  The 'sidekick' Steve Trevor, is brought to life by fan favourite Nathan Fillion, and he walks similar thin line between someone capable of standing along side the Amazon Princess and at the same time being flirting shamelessly as the everyman. The story itself deals with the birth of Wonder Woman and her quest to track down the rogue god of war, Ares. There is a lot of violence and a lot of blood and death. Nothing we haven't seen in films, but it is new to the DCU animated titles. So keep this in mind of children. This was intended for an older audience.

This DVD set is what we as fans should be treated to every time. We get plenty of Batman and Superman and even Green Lantern, but what about the other favourites? Why can't we get a feature with the Flash, Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Swamp Thing, Hawkman or any other of the great characters in the DC universe?

She's smart, strong, independent and will not back down from a true fight.  She's not only a symbol for women but a sign of the times for everybody to stand up and stay strong during the struggles we go thru.

I however, being a superhero-worshipping adult, did watch it. I thought the story was good but the issue I have is with some of the writing. I do not know if the writers/producers knew they would have a PG-13 so they wrote the sex jokes to justify that or they just wrote the story and it ended up warranting the rating. The war violence/blood was probably the reason behind the rating so I don't know why the sexual (esp. breast) jokes were needed at all - I am not a prude - they were just dumb and did not add anything to the story. As some others have noted the character of Steve Trevors was poorly written with his attitudes on women straight out of the 40s or 50s and his improbable superhuman strength and fighting skills that could match WW's for a time.",1304553600,2,918,4.405882352941177

I remember the DC Universe reconstruction after Crisis on Infinite Earths, and, on my opinion, the best character stories after this event was Wonderwoman, but, even there, she couldn't defeat Ares, only make him to see the truth, but, on this animated movie, I consider the God of War was clearly underpowered, as even Hypollyta defeats him too. Not a big antagonist, I think. But, the animation quality in inquestionable: perfect from the beggining. The problem is the leak of a little good sense here.",1304035200,,644,4.8108108108108105
3684679,4,B001LK8TEM,"I like the story, which is not the best but good; it is a nice try at an origin story.  The action scenes are good particularly the ancient war where Queen Hippolyta was the wonder woman of her time.  And the animation is above average and looked good for the most part.

What made this movie less than great is Wonder Woman is NOT exactly that -- wondrous.

WW is the S man's equivalent: what she lacks in the strength department, she makes up for in amazing fighting ability; laser eyes with deflecting bracelets; super breath with a tiara and indestructible lasso.  She also flies like the Sman but because she's a woman, she gets to have accessories like the invisible plane.  And she's prettier.

So what happened?

She should have been showcased as the ultimate superpowered warrior in the DC universe with profound wisdom.  The real WW is the one found in Justice League Season 1 -- she could stop Sman if needed. A similar treatment is seen in Batman/Superman Apocalypse -- she is Beautiful in that movie, very strong, FLIES and had some awesome fighting moves.

In this movie, she's no more powerful than a midlevel superhero in the DC universe. And she does not fly, why?

Balance should be depicted in the DC universe. When there is a super Man, there should also be an equally super Woman. WW is the Ying in Superman's Yang, the Reaction to Sman's Action. If we are afraid of WW being great, why create her at all?

I'm not disappointed entirely but she does not need a man to help her -- she is needed to help man's world.  She was saved one too many times by Steve Trevor in this movie. I mean, really?

We live in a world ruled by Lady Gaga and Glee. I think we're ready for a Super woman.  I'm ready for the real Wonder woman who soars literally and figuratively.

Please make a better WW movie.",1300752000,2,1811,4.425981873111782
3684680,5,B001LK8TEM,"With the exception of the terrible ""Public Enemies"" I generally feel DCs animated original films are fantastic. However none shines brighter than Wonder Woman. This film is simply brilliant. The cast, animation, the story are all in perfect form. A must own. Before, Wonder Woman was just another good character in the DC's line-up of heroes; however this movie has made me a fan of the amazon princess. Keeping my fingers crossed for a second one.",1299628800,,448,4.907894736842105
3684681,5,B001LK8TEM,"Something I really appreciate about the movie-- whenever I meet someone who thinks Wonder Woman is cheesy, and they don't really know anything about the character, I can pop in the Blu-Ray and in 70 minutes show them just how cool of a character she is. DC Animation really nailed it with this movie, because it really is a perfect showcase of what a great character Wonder Woman is, and they manage to keep it accessible for both male and female audiences. Even if it has imperfections, it's still one of the best examples out there of how to make Wonder Woman both cool and accessible, and you don't have to pester your friends to attempt to read a comic in order to show it to them.

Thus movie is the right way to do Wonder Woman. She is bad ass, beautiful, and a truly empowered woman who embraces her woman instead of denying it. As a man, I find the strength and spirit of her truly admirable, and if God someday blesses me with daughters, this is a hero I would be happy to see them looking up to, in place of the weak, co-dependent floozies that they are currently bombarded with (I'm looking at you, Bella Swan). I'd also be happy to see my sons respect her the way I'm sure they will with Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man, because it's good for boys to have strong female characters to look up to, as well. This is a true female superhero movie-- it's got action, adventure, lots of Greek mythology, and even a bit of romantic comedy. If you like superheros then you should definitely check it out, because this is the Princess of the Amazons at her finest. If you watch this movie and still don't like Wonder Woman, you probably never will.

Also, the picture quality on this disc is great! Once you've seen 2D animation on Blu-Ray, you won't want to go back to DVD! It comes with a lot of great special features, too, including some episodes of Justice League featuring her. This is a disc you won't regret owning.",1298246400,3,1927,4.425352112676056
3684682,5,B001LK8TEM,This is a really cool movie version of the classic Wonder Woman story. She kicks ass. It is not a girly girl  story at all. love it! There are some graphic violent scenes that make this not a kiddie cartoon. Enjoyable!,1294617600,2,218,4.317073170731708
3684683,4,B001LK8TEM,"The production values of this DVD are superb.  The story is well crafted.

The origins of Themyscira (Paradise Island) and the Amazons are intriguing.  The ancient god of war Ares is presented in all of his ""bad ass"" glory. He feeds off the bloodshed as he preaches his ""gospel of death"".

Princess Diana is a true warrior.  She is very young, but her youth is no deterrent.  Her divine origin makes her a bridge between the gods and Amazons.

The basic story is one of betrayal, secrets, bravery, and ultimate war.  Unfortunately, Washington, DC does not fare well in this 74 minutes film.

The PG 13 rating is justified.  The war scenes at the beginning and the epic battle at the end in Washington are violent and bloody.  Well drawn with realistic action!

Disc Two has additional features:

 Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream is a documentary about how Wonder Woman was created at DC Comics in 1941 by Dr. William M. Marston who wanted a female hero as a role model for young women.  ""Truth and power of women"" were the driving force behind Marston's creation.  Women's roles in society were changing because of WWII.

 Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth examines the Greco-Roman culture transferred into current culture via the comic book.  This is a good introduction to the ancient goddesses of Greece and Rome. There is a focus on the Wonder Woman's television series with Lynda Carter.

Two cartoons: Justice League Unlimited: To Another Shore and Hawk and Dove.

I do have one issue with this film--the bar scene where Steve Trevor attempts to get Diana drunk for his own reasons.  Fortunately, she sees through his strategy and drinks him under the table.  However, it is commendable that Princess Diana did not succumb to the alcohol, but mortal young women could not survive the number of rounds that she drank.

Too many women have been used and abused because of alcohol consumption. As the film depicts--""wicked, disloyal, and above all untrustworthy"" such is the nature of the male of the species.  Male bashing?  Not really--just an honest assessment.",1293408000,2,2065,4.845272206303725
3684684,5,B001LK8TEM,I bought this movie for my niece and she loved it. The animation is fantastic and the story is very entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Wonder Woman or is a fan of good animation.,1292976000,,200,4.2894736842105265
3684685,4,B001LK8TEM,"While the supplemental extras tend to be either ignored or viewed by only the most ardent of fans, the ones on this two-disc set serve to provide background on Wonder Woman's creator, the time in which the character emerged, and her revolutionary significance in both the emergence of the rights of women and pop culture.

The two documentaries, ""Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream"" and ""Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth"" are truly engrossing, painting a most positive portrait of the comic book icon, showing why she ranks up there with Superman and Batman as one of the greatest creations in the DC Universe.

The two bonus cartoons, episodes from the ""Justice League"" series, are good but a better pair would have been the two-part installment ""Paradise Lost,"" which coincidentally features some of the same characters that appear in the ""Wonder Woman"" film.

""Paradise Lost"" actually reveals one of the weaknesses of the film: primarily in the voice-acting arena.  The television installment features Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Susan Sullivan as Hippolyta, the great English actor John Rhys-Davies as Hades, along with horror icon Robert Englund as Felix Faust.  While Keri Russell and Virginia Madsen assay the respective roles of Wonder Woman and Hippolyta in the film, they just can't compare to Eisenberg and Sullivan.  And as good as Alfred Molina is, he just doesn't have the ""power"" vocally to portray the god ""Aries.""

Also, the film has a couple of grisly deaths, obviously the reason for the PG-13 rating.  Another sequence between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor in a bar is very much for a more mature viewer, definitely not for pre-teens and under.

However, even with the three ""minuses,"" so to speak, the film is still a good-but-not-great entry in the direct-to-DVD series.",1292112000,3,1793,5.092150170648464

3684693,4,B001LK8TEM,"Yay! Finally a Wonder Woman movie! Sadly DTV will probably be the only way we ever see the character in a film as Warner Bros. keeps turning down scripts.

Fortunately the story is original whereas the first two were adaptations and the third serving as a semi-bridge between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". Utilizing Wonder Woman's supporting cast is a brilliant move seeing as how Timm never really used the Amazons very well, especially Queen Hippolyta. She always came off as an wooden and didn't really scream ""Warrior Queen"" to me. Come to think of it, all of the Amazons never seemed like great warriors in JL/JLU! They were always being beaten back by Felix Faust or some other magic spell. But thanks to the brilliant opening battle sequence, I was reassured of their prowess in battle. In fact, the Amazons are such great warriors that blood never stains their swords after stabbing or cutting someone's head off. Wonder Woman's powers are present except flight which at least is a reason why she uses the Invisible Jet (though the reason why the Amazons have it is a mystery though I think its technology is based on Themyiscara's cloaking device). Sadly, the way Diana just takes off her outer clothes to get into her outfit is just boring. I know the producers probably wanted to distance themselves from the ""Wonder Spin"" that Lynda Carter did but that has since been incorporated into the comics and was even used in JLU. If a live-action film is ever decided upon, I hope they take a cue from this movie. Just because the character originated during WWII, doesn't mean the movie has to take place there nor does it have to take place in modern or mythological times. This movie honors her history by using Wonder Woman's mythological background while having her story set in modern times.

Again the animation is great (I'm just gonna say that the animation in the other films is great so that way I don't have to say the same thing over and over). All of the Amazons look good but Wonder Woman suffers the same as Superman from Doomsday. She looks too similar to her Justice League model, which is odd because in Crisis on Two Earths she looks different from her JL model. Ares makes for a great villain and his visual suits him (much better than the JLU model), though his upgraded form kind of borders on the ridiculous. Though why Hades is the size of Jabba the Hutt is confusing as all of the statues I've ever seen of him depict him with a slim build.

Andrea Romano gives us another great cast. Keri Russell is perfect as Wonder Woman, Susan Eisenberg from JL seemed wooden several times throughout season one (then again, season one of JL was a very iffy season and she did improve). Nathan Fillion is also good as Steve Trevor, ably making him a chauvinistic pig but he has a sense of humor. Alfred Molina was a wonderful choice as Ares, adding yet another comic villain to his resum. He brings a sense of menace to him (which was something Michael York failed to do in JLU). Virginia Madsen, again a perfect choice for Hippolyta. She plays the queen with diginity, elegance and a ferocity in battle. I don't know who they picked for JL, but they should've picked Madsen from the start, she at least projected emotion. Rosario Dawson is just alright as Artemis. She was a decent choice but most of the time, she's over the top and wooden",1280016000,2,3369,4.602329450915142

3684695,5,B001LK8TEM,"Wonder Woman is a truly unique animated feature.  It boats the best fight choreography and characterization, but more impressively, uses feminist rhetoric as the centerpiece of the film.

Of all the superhero movies, my wife and I had the most fun watching Wonder Woman.  It's story is simple yet enjoyable, the action expertly choreographed, the writing fun, but it's true success lies in it's phenomenal casting and voice work, (Keri Russell as Wonder Woman, Alfred Molina as Eres the God of War, Virginia Madsen as Hippolyta, Rosario Dawson as Artemis, and Nathan Fillion as Steve Trevor.)  The skill of these actors takes WW to a new level, and Nathan Fillion's portrayal of the American fighter pilot Steve Trevor is a real gem.  There is some great dialog between Diana and Trevor, addressing post-feminist themes in relation to perceived chauvinism.

Wonder Woman succeeds because of the thrilling action, excellent fight choreography, and stellar cast.  The soundtrack accompanies the film with quality and appropriate epicness.  It brings some surprisingly good dialog and post-feminist themes to the table (which, despite being a bit beat to death, are handled well).

3684697,3,B001LK8TEM,"Wonder Woman has gotten some spectacular reviews from professional reviews but I can't say I was nearly as impressed. The movie goes back to the origin of Wonder Woman with some slight alterations from the comic book version. There was one strange change in the part where Diana competes surreptitiously in a competition to win the right to visit the outside world. In the comic she wears a mask and there was a masked fighter in the competition but it wasn't Diana so I got confused. Diana wears an open face helmet and when she inevitably wins the competition. Her mother Hippolyta asks her to remove it and reveal herself. It was weird because her face was nearly completely unobscured. This isn't a biggie but it's rather emblematic of a film that in my opinion just isn't that great.

In the first few minutes of the film Wonder Woman's future boyfriend, Steve Trevor, crash lands on Paradise Island. One of my issues with WW has always been the lack of consistency in her powers. Sometimes she's merely a very strong woman (hence the ability of the Cheetah to go toe to toe with her) and at other times she's nearly as powerful as Superman. Since men are forbidden on Paradise Island Diana (as she's called on the Island) attacks him and actually gets tossed once or twice before kicking him in the groin. The only way this makes any sense is if Diana's powers are dramatically reduced on Paradise Island because later in the film she is monstrously powerful. So Trevor gets his junk kicked up into his brain because for most of the rest of the movie he behaves like a retarded, horny frat boy. Even in front of Diana's mother when his life is being threatened he can't stop making lewd inappropriate comments about Diana. Seriously, Steve is a total dolt and his ceaseless flirting is nauseating. He even disparages Wonder Woman herself implying that her costume makes her look like a hooker and refers to her home as Chastity Belt Island.

If I were to guess why Wonder Woman has received reviews that in my opinion exceed its quality I would say it's because WW is willing to show more violence than any other DC Animation I can remember seeing. We're talking swords through the chest type violence and what fanboy wouldn't love to see an island of stacked Amazonians. Also, when Diana first puts on her Wonder Woman costume her bustier causes her breasts to bounce. The fact is that at my age it's going to take more than some jiggling cartoon boobs to get me interested. The worst thing for me was the way Wonder Woman would go on a feminist rant about how the outside world represses women and how women buy into this and become weak and needy but then she falls for a complete lout. Trevor even literally refers to himself as a chauvinistic pig but she still ends up with him. As a final insult Wonder Woman is facing off against Ares, the God of War, and he tells her she has learned nothing to which she replies, `I've learned one thing... It's not polite to hit a lady' WHAT?!?! That is completely diametrically opposite of everything Wonder Woman has preached through the movie. I had the thought that this film was written by a man trying badly to put himself in the mind of a liberated female until I discovered the writer was Gail Simone who is probably the best female comic writer in the business. What the heck happened?

It's not a terrible film but it just wasn't for me. Whatever message the film was trying to convey failed in my book and despite the praise other have heaped on the film I found the animation mediocre for a DC animated movie. It's worth seeing but I wouldn't pay to own it.",1277337600,7,3618,4.537519142419602

I thought the draws were going to be better, with more deatil and better color, the animation is fine not as good as other movies. The plot is weak the Amazons are shown as slaves at the beginning, queen Hyppolita is a brave warrior which is something good, because we always saw her as somebody ""sweet"". Wonder Woman is shown here as a very aggressive woman sometimes with no feelings, the design of her face is ugly, they should have made a pretty woman. Ares is in a cell in Themyscira something I don't find any sense, he's a God and should be in a place where the gods can watch him. The Amazons are Greek and some buildings in Themyscira are pyramids of Mexican style, that's a big mistake, there are many centuries of difference between both civilizations. And I see they have books when they didn't had them. They way they dress it's very modern not of Greek style at all, and, how do they have a jet? Technology is forbidden in the island.

Being an origin story, the movie does have it's share of tedious expository dialogue, but I found the performances and pacing of the story to be very enjoyable, along with a great script.

Nathan Fillion as Steve Trevor was the real highlight. Usually humor falls flat in these animated adventures with stilted dialogue coming from the editing process, but Fillion's delivery actually had me laughing out loud a couple of times.

Alfred Molina is also great as the villain Ares, really making the emotional moments of the character stand out just as much as the evil ones.

3684710,1,B001LK8TEM,"I'm a huge Wonder Woman fan and received this DVD as a birthday present.  Since Wonder Woman has never been given the star treatment of other comic book heroes(where is her live-action movie?), I felt that even an animated movie was long overdue, and looked forward to seeing the film.
It's horrible.  It's worse than horrible. It's the death of a classic, and the shredding of what was a strong, thoughtful, feminist role model for little girls. The logic errors are enough to put your teeth on edge (the Amazons have a supersonic invisible jet, but no guns? The God of War has been made impotent for generations, but wars continue to rage on earth? And where did all those Pegasuses come from, and since when do Amazons ride them ineffectually into battle?), but worst of all is the treatment of Wonder Woman herself.

As originally conceived, Wonder Woman was, at her core, curious about the world of Man and eager to explore the cultural differences between Paradise Island and the United States. Well, no longer. In this film, she's a judgmental man-hater, nasty to other women, and a ruthless killer.  The Wonder Woman of my childhood was a fierce patriot who always turned over the bad guys to the authorities.  Granted, the storyline here is so implausible and convoluted that it's never clear if the bad guys are monsters or men, but her actions have nothing to do with justice. The film leads up to one big bloodbath, and Wonder Woman is on the side of no one but herself. Steve Trevor isn't the genial, obtuse love-interest; he's a rude, sexist frat boy.

The elimination of anything even remotely admirable about the female characters in this film is so thorough, I could only conclude that it was deliberate; perhaps to assure that the intended audience would be angry, lovelorn teenage males, not small girls and others who long to see a leading female who is neither vampy nor vapid.  Even Hera is reduced to a soft-spoken wife who urges the Amazons to listen to Zeus, the raging father, and spare the life of a rapist.

I've never written a review on Amazon, but this film is so dreadful, I felt I had to do what I could to warn people to save their money.  Wonder Woman deserves better than this!",1256083200,22,2213,4.639386189258312

It was akin to something you would see in ""300"" - it made ""Troy"" look like a kid's movie.  My jaw was agape when this prologue ended, and the caption ""Wonder Woman"" appeared with a stirring musical score.

I had no idea it was Wonder Woman and I've always been a WOnder Woman fan... so I had to buy it.  The rest of the movie did not disappoint.  Megan Fox called Wonder Woman a ""lame"" superhero... she needs to watch this movie.",1255910400,,605,4.463636363636364

3684715,4,B001LK8TEM,"Save for a single exception (Superman Doomsday), I've feverishly preordered and relished in each and every DCAU animated motion picture production that has come from Warner Brothers (yes that means the Superman/ Batman Public Enemies official countdown has already begun).  Wonder Woman had the distinction of being one of two full-length feature films released within a relatively short period of time (the other being Green Lantern First Flight which was released July 28th after WW's March 3rd release date).  As such I waited for GL to drop before ordering both films and had the unique experience of viewing them literally back-to-back.

My review pertains specifically to the two-disc Special Edition DVD release and hence the hard facts of the set break down as follows:  Feature runtime of 74 minutes, a rating of PG-13 (due to sequences laced with violence and occasional suggestive material).  The first DVD contains the film, a full commentary track by the creative team, and an exclusive look at the Green Lantern Animated feature.

The second disc contains two commentaries pertaining specifically to the Wonder Woman mythos: Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream & Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth.  Finally Bruce Timm presents two Justice League episodes.

The story can best be described as a cross between classic Greek-mythology merged with a modern day setting/ apocalyptic struggle for the fate of humanity.  In a word the scope of this film could best be described as ""massive"".  The show literally opens with an animated battle sequence that would fit right in with live action films such as 300 or Lord of the Rings.

In extreme summation, the tale is basically Wonder Woman's origin story retold and fit to include a very modern-day interpretation of Washington DC.  Contained within are both the very earliest origins of the title character (which at some points predate her birth) and then her transformation from Amazon Princess to American super heroine.

Plot Spoilers Ahead:

The opening battle comes to a violent and graphic conclusion when Hippolyta (Diana's mother) beheads her own son, Thrax, who was conceived by none other than Ares.  Shocked at the fall of their son, Ares is caught off guard and falls to Hippolyta's sword as well.  Fueled with anger and hatred, Hippolyta is poised to slay Ares as well when Zeus intervenes and prevents her from taking Ares' life.

Zeus' companionate wife Hera offers to instead bind Ares' powers with gauntlets so that he would be no more of a threat than a mere mortal. In compensation for their cooperation, the Amazons are granted the mystical island of Themyscira (which is cloaked from the eyes of man), where besides remaining forever young and beautiful, they are to hold the shackled Ares prisoner for all time.

 Life for the Amazons on Themyscira would potentially remain blissfully isolated from the rest of the world if not for the American fighter pilot Steve Trevor who crash lands on the all-female (save for Ares) hidden island.  The task then becomes one of finding an Amazon warrior up to the task of returning the pilot to his homeland of the United States.

End of spoilers.

The film is really quite beautiful to behold with a nice large color pallet and sweeping sense of scope.  Voice work is typical of the type of stuff Andrea Romano puts out in all of the DC animated productions.  Kerri Russell nails the role of Diana/ WW and Firefly's Nathan Fillion is equally well cast as the energetic/ optimistic Steve Trevor.

Keeping in mind that this is the first animated feature devoted specifically to Wonder Woman, the film's production crew did a fantastic job ensuring that the material did her justice (no pun intended).  Much of this is credited to the direction of Lauren Montgomery; a storyboard artist on Justice League Unlimited and Justice League: New Frontier as well as one of three directors on the animated film, Superman: Doomsday.

About the biggest complaint that I can partially sympathize with regarding Wonder Woman is that the entire story arc maintains its massive scope/ mythological influence without devoting much time to the Wonder Woman superhero character so beloved in both comic incarnations and in shows like Justice League/ JL Unlimited.  This was most certainly due to the 74-minute runtime and the restrictions involved therein.  Without providing direct spoilers, I will say that the material sets up the characters for a perfect sequel (or even television-based animated series) opportunity in the final moments of the movie.  Should either come to fruition, this animated film will likely be credited as flawlessly presenting the source material for another hit DCAU franchise.  Here's hoping!

As it stands however, it's very easy to recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed the DCAU's past animated efforts, has even the slightest interest in the Wonder Woman mythos, or just plain enjoys fine storytelling in the animated medium.  My only warning is to take the PG-13 rating seriously as the violence may be a bit harsh on younger viewers.  The special features contained within the two-disc special edition are informative, entertaining, and quite thorough.  Make a big bowl of popcorn and settle in for 74 minutes of DC animated goodness that serves as a reminder of the type of quality material that Bruce Timm and company have made so popular throughout the years.",1253836800,4,5402,5.0655367231638415

Sure, Batman the Animated Series is still better, but that's Batman, who is very hard to compete with. Wonder Woman surprised me, however, because the character, while classic, always seemed a bit silly to me. Somehow, the film makes Wonder Woman relevant, not to mention very entertaining.

If you like superheroes at all, even the tiniest bit, give this film a try.

(As a side note to parents, this film is PG-13 for a reason. It features graphic depictions of violence. Cartoon or not, this is not a film for children, unless you believe your child would not be upset by a beheading or similar acts.)",1252713600,2,782,4.659420289855072

The only two downsides are I didn't care for Rosario Dawsons performance, and Alfred Molinas Ares reminded me too much of James Woods' performance in Hercules from Disney. Aside from that just a great movie. Worth every penny.",1250467200,2,714,4.484615384615385

This portrayal of the character is between that of Wonder Woman as a untried Warrior and as a fledgeling Hero, which is natural since it is an origin story. It makes absolute sense that she is not portrayed as the full-blown and developed 'Wonder Woman' because at this stage she isn't yet, that is who she will eventually become.

From the very beginning, this movie is a whole lot of fun to watch. As I saw Hippolyta fly through the air to battle Ares, I was already excited to watch the rest. The battle scenes are brutal and great to watch. The voice cast is excellent, and includes an always welcome Nathan Fillion as Steve Trevor. Aside from a few things left unexplained (such as why the entire city of Washington D.C. just happens to be conveniently free of every last citizen when the final battle takes place), it is probably one of the best DCAU projects to date.",1248220800,2,775,4.6231884057971016
3684728,5,B001LK8TEM,"Too many comics are nothing but mind-numbing action, but Wonder Woman is amazing on several different levels. Well, plenty of action, yes, but so much more. Several examples of Greek mythology play a major role in story development, which makes the movie very engrossing to watch, especially if you've studied mythology and have an interest in Greek culture. Sexism is another major cornerstone that, while only touched on in a few other comics and cartoons, is stated very boldly here, which made me fall in love with the movie and Wonder Woman in general. Not only does it teach that women can be just as strong as men, but that one big reason men and women often don't understand each other is because of lack of communication. I could imagine several instances where this movie could be shown and learned from in a classroom, be it high school or college.

Education aside, it's just fun to watch girls do a lot of the butt-kicking instead of the guys. Recently I've been watching Batman, Transformers, etc., which are really great don't get me wrong (I love them all!), but wow!

3684734,4,B001LK8TEM,"Up until this movie came out, the recent releases of the DC animated films have felt like little more than fan service. I wasn't all that impressed with Superman:Doomsday (it was hardly the Death of Superman story anyway). New Frontier was great but lacked a grander feel that I think the story deserved. And Gotham Knight seemed more of a cash in on the Dark Knight hype of summer '08.
  Wonder Woman is more like it! Superman and Batman are great characters but way too over exposed. I have been waiting for years for them to give some service to the other great characters of the DC pantheon. And where better to start than the amazonian princess herself? This treatment felt right. It had the grip of a ""for general audiences"" popcorn movie while still retaining respect for all the great things about the character. This truly showed how she is hardly someone to play second fiddle to Superman or Batman. The movie showed how she is a highly trained combatant and diplomat. Her character design thankfully evoked Greek perfection and athletesism. Her voice design (Keri Russel) added a wonderful youthfulness and energy while still retaining that obligatory naivity you see in all characters cut off from society. In fact the entire cast is great. Alfred Molina does as good a job as anyone could expect but I felt his performance seemed a bit ""phoned in"" as Ares. The voice I did enjoy immensely was Virginia Madsen's characterization as Hippolyta. If Russel sounds like youthful Diana then Madsen would undoubtedly sound like grown Diana (Hippolyta being her mother of course).
  And the one mark I count most for in any of these projects is the animation. For low budget ""television"" style production it is damn impressive! The action sequences are smooth and kinetic and exactly what you want to see in an ""action feature"". I was worried that a movie about Wonder Woman was going to be made tame but this one delivers on its PG-13 rating. It is the most intense and thrilling of any of the previous DC animated films and certainly more entertaining. Great Hera, this movie is highly recommended!",1243296000,,2104,4.787878787878788

3684736,5,B001LK8TEM,"Let's face it--the animation division of Time Warner has pretty much been the dominant division in this field for close to 70 years.  From the Bugs Bunny, Road Runner and other shorts of the 1940-1960 era, Warner Brothers have been able to create story, character and humor with great consistency.  But when Time Warner acquired DC Comics, it gave the animation division a whole new area to go into.  To that end, Time Warner--between the 1989 Batman movie and 1992's Batman Returns--launched ""Batman: The Animated Series"" for Fox Kids in 1992...and the collaboration between DC Comics/Warner Animation took off, giving us 13 years of great animation and storytelling.  This is a credit to two people--the great Bruce Timm, whose vision brought the storytelling to B:TAS and its successors (Batman Beyond, Superman: The Animated Series, and the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited) and allowed the drawn characters to be ""fleshed out""--having personalities and conflicts, being human.  The other person who should receive loads of credit...is the longtime voice casting director for Warner/DC, Andrea Romano.  She has not been afraid of the name of the vocal actor outweighing the drawn character; if anything, the vocal performances have enhanced the art--obviously Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker; Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor, or Carl Lumbly's J'onn J'onzz from the JL/JLU.
  It seems logical that Warners/DC would step from the television work to the feature-length films they've been doing the last few years, and it seems linear to think that they would concentrate on origin stories, which is the premise of Wonder Woman.  Continuing with the philosophy that Timm originated with B:TAS, the story does have an adult tone that some parents might not think their children ready for.  It is a VERY good story, both in terms of art and voice work.  Once again, Romano has put together a very good vocal cast--Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion have worked on-screen together (""Waitress"").  I thought Russell might have been a bit light for Diana, but since it's a ""first-time"" story it was probably wiser to have a younger voice...Fillion seems to bring a lot of ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" to Steve Trevor; making him less the classic ""Dude in Distress"" from the early days of Marston's art to a little bit of a partner with the Princess.  Alfred Molina's work as Ares is insidious and greasy, in line with many of his live-action turns as villains.  Virginia Madsen makes a great Hyppolyta, Rosario Dawson gives great anger to Artemis, and Oliver Platt steals the scenes where he voices Hades.
  But as GOOD as this movie is, it points up a long-term problem that Time Warner has had regarding the character.  The last five years, Warners/DC Comics/Legendary Pictures has been working on a live-action Wonder Woman project which has gone through names conncecting to it and pulling out, speculation on many a website as to who gets to put on the breastplate and the crown...just a lot of starts and stops when it comes to getting the production started, much less on film.  The biggest problem--and she gets mentioned only slightly in the special features in the two-disk set--is Lynda Carter hasn't been reborn.  If the casting directors can't find a 23-year old brunette who's at least 5'10"", athletic, and is (ahem) rather well built (Trevor/Fillion's observation about Diana's ""upper-body"" is great...and makes the movie PG-13 by itself), then it's better to draw Wonder Woman simply because no live person is going to look better than the artist's version of her.
  Because of the story, the art, and the brilliant voice work; this version of ""Wonder Woman"" is highly suggested.  It's adult, but charming; nostalgic but incredibly hip.",1242345600,2,3749,5.111475409836066
3684737,5,B001LK8TEM,"I knew of Wonder Woman but didn't know much else about her. Not her history or her story. This movie does a great job of making us familiar with her world and the characters. Great action, voice acting and a lot of the cheesy cartoon lines are limited to a few here and there.

Only slightly annoying thing was all the men are pigs theme but even that had a purpose and wasn't that bad. I'm not sure how accurate the story is to the comics but i'm sure some can be forgiving by fans considering that it's a well made movie and a great 1st try. Good stuff folks.",1242259200,,561,4.1

3684739,5,B001LK8TEM,"Mind you, my first choice to bring WONDER WOMAN into the 21st Century is Joss Whedon, who would not only manage to update our heroine but completely reimagine it. But this updating is based not on William Marston's original Wonder Woman, but later updatings. So while it doesn't break any new ground, it covers the familiar one is very satisfying fashion.

The best thing about the movie is that while it covers the Wonder Woman origin story as well as you might hope, they also work in a nice story, with god of war Ares attempting to destroy the world, while Diana strives to prevent him. And the story is also enlivened by numerous moments of wit and intelligence. The entire production is several notches above just about any other animated superhero film.

The voice over talent is uneven and is the weakest part of the film. In the two lead roles we have the stars of WAITRESS reunited. Nathan Fillion is outstanding as Steve, but I was mildly disappointed with Keri Russell as Diana (I love Keri Russell as a rule and think we need many, many more movies with her). Alfred Molina and Oliver Platt are both excellent as Ares and Hades respectively, while Virginia Madsen is great as Hippolyta, but far too many of the supporting talent disappoints.

Still, this is a highly entertaining film. It doesn't correct the unjustified neglect of Woman Woman, one of the greatest of DC heroes (along with Superman and Batman, one of the Big Three) by DC in producing their movies. But it at least is a step in the right direction. Now if they will only go back to Joss Whedon and ask him once more to make a feature length film",1241827200,,1625,4.558219178082192

3684741,4,B001LK8TEM,"This is a great re-imagining of the DC Comic.  Although I would have loved to see a movie version, this animated DVD special features a modern update to the origins of Wonder Woman.  And what a great update.  Hippolyta is a vicious warrior, an Amazon betrays her own in the worst way, Steve Trevor is a womanizing horndog and the God of the underworld is depicted as a fat drag queen (if she were alive, Divine would have been a shoe-in to play the movie version of this character).

Kerri Russell as the voice of Diana/Wonder Woman lends this iconic character just the right touch of feminine charm and warrior toughness.  The plot revolves around Ares and his imprisonment deep within the bowels of Themyscira, the island in which the Amazons have been residing for almost 1000 years.  When Ares is released, he manages to wreak havoc in man's world once more.  It's up to Wonder Woman to stop this rampaging, maniacal God before nuclear war becomes a stark certainty.

The animation is solid and the voice acting does this animated DVD justice.  Definitely a must-have for comic fans of Wonder Woman.  There are some minor adult situations and mildly suggestive language, so this should be ideal only for children 12 and older.",1240790400,3,1230,4.732394366197183

The dialogue and sexual innuendo between Steve and Diana was very well written.  What really cracked me up, though, was the close-up of Wonder Woman as she donned and adjusted her costume over her huge bosom.  Classic.

I could have done without the ongoing monotonous violence, though.  There was room for much more character development and dialogue that worked so well in the few other parts of the story.  Why spoil it with so much fighting?  Being so long and dragged out, the fight scenes didn't really move the story forward as much as some great dialogue and personal interaction would have.

Lastly, the animation and voice casting was fantastic.  Who knew Felicity (Keri Russell) would make such a great Amazon Warrior Princess?

The animation is fantastic, a step up from 'Justice League', and the story is complex, smart and really entertaining. At first I wasn't overly impressed with the voice acting, but then I realized how perfectly the actors voices represent the characters. Keri Russel as Diana may come off sounding wooden at first, but then you see that she really does sound like a strong warrior who needs to be warmed up a bit by Nathan Fillion's character. He does a great job at the red-blooded, all American male role and the chemistry between the two characters crackles and pops with sexual tension and humorous banter that makes for a fun romantic comedy. The action in this feature is compelling and it flows nicely with the plot, never dragging out or anything.
I was never a fan of the Wonder Woman character before I saw this movie but now I am and I have become compelled to re-watch Justice League and the like because of this.

Unfortunately for me his work that follows has been marginal.  I think so far the Justice League (New Frontier) movie was the best but Superman Doomsday and now this effort have fallen short of my expectations.  The Wonder Woman story for me was marginal although it was interesting to see the take on the backstory. The plot of the movie seemed to have been written by writers stuck in their adolescence.  It all wraps up with a battle in DC which is just ludicrous.

What made Batman TAS and the other shows so different was the depth of the personalities, attention to the story, unique character designs and backdrops.  This effort falls very short in all those areas.  The animation was stiff and most of the characters, particularly Trevor looked flat and unappealing.

For me the story was interesting.  Not being a comic book reader, I love learning about these characters through these animated films. The biggest distraction was the poor animation and character design.  I've read how people say the animation is so good but come on.  A dedicated movie like this deserves more than the usual Sat. morning fare and some of those are better.  The characters simply fall flat, particularly Steve Trevor. Not sure what is missing with Wonder Woman but remember how appealing the characters looked on Batman TAS (and I know these are cartoons)?  Much of that is missing here. I can understand that with projects such as these you want to change things up a bit but I find previous incarnations better.  As for the PG-13 rating, no doubt to make the movie more appealing to older audiences, is mainly for the violence seen throughout. It contributes little to the story and seems a bit gratuitous; having it for the sake of having it.  Hopefully the next outing will be better but with the exception of the previous Justice League adventure, Marvel is outdoing DC with the straight to DVD superhero flicks.",1239840000,5,1428,4.7408906882591095

Wonder Woman is written more coherently than the latter, brings our lead character up-to-date without denying her legendary heritage and is well-drawn and voice-acted. It's my teen-aged son's favorite of the three animated films, which suggests Warners should give its primary market - teenaged boys - some credit for not being as sexist or simple-minded as they might imagine.

This is probably the strongest, savviest, sexiest Wonder Woman we've seen lately - and she's not running around in a ridiculously high pair of heels while heroically saving the worldfrom descending into Hell. I recommend it highly.

3684757,4,B001LK8TEM,"DC's solid line of animated features continues, and Wonder Woman is surprisingly the best yet.  While Wonder Woman is part of DC's trinity (alongside Superman and Batman), she's never quite reached the uber-popularity of either of the aforementioned characters.  Well, here's hoping that she does, as this animated Wonder Woman feature contains everything that makes her such a great character, from some dynamite action to some surprisingly deep-rooted Greek mythology.  This is an origin story, in which Wonder Woman/Diana (voiced by Kerri Russell) is sent away from her homeland of Themyscria to take down the evil god of war Ares (voiced by Alfred Molina) as he seeks to reclaim his power and unleash destruction across the planet.  Along with her is roguish, womanizing pilot Steve Trevor (voiced by Nathan Fillion), who crash landed on her island and is simply smitten with her as well.  There's heaping amounts of action (that is definitely too violent for very young viewers), a great modern re-telling of Wonder Woman's origins, and a great voice cast that also includes Rosario Dawson, Virginia Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, and Oliver Platt; all of which do great work.  All in all, Wonder Woman is a wonderful (no pun intended) animated feature that old and new fans alike will definitely enjoy, and the DVD special features (including some insightful documentaries and a look at DC's next upcoming animated feature based on Green Lantern) are worth the price of admission alone.",1239235200,,1488,5.179166666666666

The special features on the second disc give a more in-depth look at what it was creating Wonder Woman and how she has changed over the years, and also how she's stayed the same, and how this latest incarnation is in comparison to her past.

Air Force pilots are not only trained to be fighters but are also trained to be ambassadors of the Air Force and the United States. All I kept thinking was, ""Wow, this is really disrespectful to fighters like the Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds.""
Taking it too seriously, probably, but even a writer who knew nothing about the military would not have an officer acting like that. Especially the remarks he made to a rookie pilot on a training mission.
I mean, don't get me wrong, in the locker room, they may banter like that, but when meeting new people from new lands?
No.
Never.
They are too disciplined for that.
I wish they would have stuck to the comic book origins, which would have been better. But, they do odd things with Wonder Woman. Now, in the comic books, Athena is running around Olympus looking like she works on Wall Street and uses a laptop computer.
She's a goddess, and she uses a laptop computer?
I was hoping Bruce Timm would stick with the version from Justice League. I thought that characterization of her was very good. They made her the female Superman like she was back in the forties. Like she is today. I also wish they'd gotten Susan Eisenberg to come back for the voice work. She did it extremely well, conveying both strength and femininity.
To me, she is to Wonder Woman what Kevin Conroy is to Batman.
The story-line is thin, Trevor comes off downright unlikeable at times and tolerable at others. Like other people have noted, she is supposed to be powerful and a mortal decks her.
If you've never seen a Wonder Woman animation version, you'll probably like it. If you've seen Justice League, you may--or probably--won't.
The character has gotten the short end of the stick in writing for a long time, although the writers of her books today are far above what she's had. I would have thought that since she is ranked among the Big Three in the DC Universe next to Superman and Batman, we would have gotten something with a little more substance.
I would recommend you check out Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.
Best Wonder Woman line from Justice League:
She is stuck in the old west with Superman and Batman and is deflecting bullets with her bracelets, and turns to them with a bored look on her face and says, ""These are the biggest, slowest bullets I have ever seen.""
ROFL!!!!
I don't know what changed from Justice League to this, but the great writing mixed with the slick humor is nowhere to be found here.",1238803200,2,2682,4.509240246406571

3684767,4,B001LK8TEM,"Being a Wonder Woman fan for years, I'm so happy a movie of any sort has finally been done. I'm very pleased with this feature, in fact, it could have been released to theaters. The only thing that keeps me from giving the film 5 stars is some inconsistancy with the charactors and holes in the story compared with the comics tale of Diana's origin and powers. For example, In no version of Diana's story did Hippolyta have any kind of relationship with Ares. Heracles, yes, but not Ares. Also, early on, Steve Trevor engages Diana in a one-on-one fight. Diana should have been able to just grab him by the collar and hold him with no effort, instead, he holds his own. Later, we see her pick up a large desk, throw demons through walls, punch Ares off the Washington Monument, etc. However, this doesn't really take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The animation is very well done, the charactors are spot-on, and the visual effects are wonderful. This film has a better score than MANY live-action movies I've seen. Of course, the amazons are depicted as what they were: warriors. As a result, nothing much was held back in battle and fight scenes. Lots of violence and death, although with little blood flowing. Thought should be taken regarding young children viewing this film, as it is quite violent, along with some remarkably adult humor throughout. By and large, I loved the film, aside from the faults I listed earlier, along with her seemingly not being able to fly, which is a departure again from the comics and earlier animated versions of the Amazon princess. For first-time Wonder Woman viewers, this will serve as an excellent intro, while it should make dedicated fans happy also.",1238284800,,1703,4.718120805369128

3684772,4,B001LK8TEM,"'Bout freaking time Wo-Wo got her own gig! After three other made-for-video animated movies, DC Universe put together the first origin story involving one of their Big 3, Wonder Woman, which is great since Josh ""Whedonverse"" Whedon dropped the ball on the whole live-action film deal. Unlike Superman: Doomsday, Justice League: New Frontier, and Batman: Gotham Knight, this one isn't continuing from an already established storyline. It takes the original premise of Wonder Woman from the 40s, and resets it for the 21st Century.

A few thousand years ago, the Amazons were under the subjection of Ares, the Greek god of war. Queen Hippolyta leads her sister-warriors in a battle to liberate themselves from Ares, and their bastard son, who like all good mothers, Hippolyta beheads. The Amazons are freed, and allowed to live on a secluded island called Themyscara(aka: Paradise Island), but must keep watch over the now less than powerful Ares who they keep imprisioned. Shoot ahead to modern day where skirtchasing pilot Steve Trevor crashlands on the island and is taken in by Diana, the daughter of Hippolyta brought to life from clay. The Amazons determine that Steve is not a theat, and hold a tournament to see who would be the one to take him back home. Diana disguises herself as a common warrior, and wins. But, its discovered that Ares seduced his jailer Persephone, and the two of them made their escape off the island. Diana now has to deliver Steve back to America, but at the same time find Ares. Once back in the States, Steve offers to help Diana. After a few drinks, they are attacked by a demigod working for Ares. Diana stops him, and learns that Ares is at an ancient temple leading to Tartarus. Diana and Steve fight Ares and Persephone in the temple, but are unable to stop them from entering the underworld, where Ares gets his uncle Hades to restore his godly powers. Steve takes the injured Diana to a hospital, where they explore their feelings. Ares then leads an assault on Washington D.C. with an army of monsters. Diana rushes to stop him, but is outnumbered. Fortunately, the Amazons arrive, and go all 300 on Ares' forces. Not even the combined might of zombie Amazons, and Ares' now more empowered strength stops Diana and the others from defeating him. Diana returns with others to Themyscara, but Hippolyta realizes that the Amazons should continue to learn more about the ""world of man"", and appoints Diana as their emissary. Diana now goes incognito as a regular American citizen with Steve knowing her true identity, which is now dubbed Wonder Woman. The film ends with her taking on the supervillainess, Cheetah.

This was actually one of the better DC Universe selections. The animation was truly exceptional from the first two American-animated movies(Batman: Gotham Knight was all anime), and the story moved along really well. The only real downside was that alot was cut out for the sake of meeting Warner's 75 minute time limit. I dunno why, but all their OVAs have to be no more than 75 minutes, maybe to fit into a 90 minute airtime on Cartoon Network or something. Because of this though, there's quite a few corners that get shaved, like no explanation of where the technology for the invisible jet came from or how Diana even knows how to pilot it, and how a powerless Ares made it off Themyscara and all the way to Cuba with no boat or anything.

The voice acting was pretty fair too, especially Nathan ""Captain Hammer"" Fillion as Steve Trevor. The character designs were also good. I liked the fact that they went back and made Hippolyta a brunette unlike on Justice League and the original Wonder Woman TV series where she was always blonde. Ares seems like a villain from a Yoshiaki Kawajiri animated film. Artemis looks pretty buff, like she usually does in the comics. Diana appears to be alot taller and athletic than in most other animated incarnations of her. Aside from the colossal design she had in Justice League: New Frontier, this version has her as a real warrior type, and not just a buxom chick in a swimsuit.

Aside from the short runtime on it, Wonder Woman is a very satisfying superhero movie, animated or otherwise. The whole focus on this was mainly on Wonder Woman's mythological ties, and since she's a myth-based hero like Thor, Hercules, and Captain Marvel, at least most of the plots she's involved with are about gods and demons. Since this movie got most of that taken care of, if they end up doing some kind of contuation from it in say Wonder Woman 2, they'll hopefully be able to focus a little more on the actual superhero side of the character.

What happened to Hercules? Why wasn't the story told from that angle? If anything, why didn't they use the George Perez version of WW's origin, which is, personally speaking... the best.
Steve Trever crashes on the island and acts like a sexist pig. Yes, the women are beautiful, but an air force officer would not act that way... especially in front of a queen! Next, the Amazons can't figure out what ""crap"" means, but they sure know how to build and fly an invisible jet! No explaination whatsoever. And since when can't Diana fly? That was one constant throughout all the various WW series. Either she can soar using air currents or she can outright fly like Superman.
In one scene, Diana is super strong. The next scene, she's being decked by a mortal man. How about a little consistency? And since when is Etta Candy a hottie? She's always been ""plump"". This whole DVD is sooo wrong!",1238025600,30,1045,4.623655913978495

The conversation was actually very funny, especially Steve Trevor.  The voices were spot on.  In particular, Hippolyta had a deep, strong voice, just like I'd imagine a warrior queen.

Wonder Woman was so graceful, athletic, strong, and totally kicked butt.

The animation was clear with beautiful lines.  The music was particularly good.  The story line rocked and was punctuated with funny lines.

I was surprised at some of the mature conversation (i.e. ""I need to get you dressed in something that won't get me arrested for solicitation"" (or something like that) and ""I like your daughter's rack"".  I was also surprised by some of the battle scenes (beheadings, death etc.). I'd say it's not for little children.

Yet, something compelled me to get this animated feature. I'm really glad I did. Out of all the Warner Priemere/DC Universe Animated Features that I have, this has to be the very best of them all.

The story begins with a battle between the Amazons and the forces of Ares. Upon defeating Ares, Zeus forbids Hippolyta from slaying him and she imprisons Ares in a prison cell on the Amazons' homeland known as Themyscira, where he is shackled with bracelets that inhibit him from thriving off the psychic energy created by murder and mayhem. Embittered by her experiences with mankind, Hippolyta shelters the Amazons from ever dealing with men again. She creates a daughter from sand, Diana, and raises her to be a warrior like the rest of the women on her island. Yet, their life is disrupted when Steve Trevor crash lands on the island. Hippolyta orders him returned to his homeland. In order to do so, the women compete to see who has the honor of carrying him home. Hippolyta forbids Diana to compete yet she competes anyway, secretly. Diana wins the contest and is bestowed the honor. Yet, she takes on a greater mission when it is found out that Ares has escaped. Diana, along with Steve, must locate Ares and stop him from bringing about bloodshed. That's when things get very interesting.

Director Lauren Montgomery did a great job directing this animated feature. Make no mistake, folks, this is a very adult-oriented cartoon...not one I'd suggest children to see. While there is very little blood present in the movie, there are many stabbings and decapitations in the movie as well as innuendos of an adult nature. Extras include: Commentary by Producers Gregory Novak and Bruce Timm, Writer Michael Jelenic and Director Lauren Montgomery, An exclusive first look at the  Upcoming Green Lantern animated feature, From Graphic Novel to Animated Movie: Justice League: New Frontier, Batman Gotham Knight: An Anime Evolution, Wonder Woman: Amazon Princess, the Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream featurette & the Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth featurette.

So the story here is completely new to me and I LOVED it! I really hope there is a live action Wonder Woman movie made and I can only hope it's half as good as this! My one complaint is the invisible plane. It's kind of dumb. But it did provide a pretty fine line in the movie. And as for the corny dialog, it's handled brilliantly in this movie. The jokes are actually funny! And they serve to break up the seriousness of it all. This would be absolutely PERFECT for a live action film! What are they waiting for? DO IT! One of my favorite lines: ""Mr. President, we're still not sure what those things are on the front lawn."" LMAO!

The only other thing, the artwork of the characters is rather simplistic. It's just slightly better than what you see on TV. They're animated fantastically but I wish the film had a bigger budget so they could have spent more time making the characters look better.

As a huge fan of animated super heroes, I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. What a waste of energy. This is by far the worst of the 3 features produced by Bruce Timm (the genius behind Batman TAS and Justice League Unlimited - both classics).

My biggest issue is with the story. It is all ancient gods and demons, monsters and gates of hell. Basically a bad episode of Xena, without the humour or irony. It climaxes with hairy beasties fighting on Washington DC's front lawn with a bunch of bow and arrow wielding ancient Amazons; a pointless, joyless mess of ridiculous action. If I'm watching a Super Hero film, I want said amazing hero duking it out with his/her nemesis in the mundane every-day world. Leave the gods and demons to the fantasy set.

Beyond the boring, stupid story was the way it was told. For some untold reason, Wonder Woman can not fly (despite being able to in all previous incarnations). Also she has been significantly powered down, in Comic Lore she is almost as strong as Superman, but can barely handle a mortal man when he lands on her hidden island paradise. This strength level seems to fluctuate throughout the film with no justification. One minute she is able to lift a huge desk as if it were made of paper, next minute she can be knocked out by a mortal. Also though the Amazons have lived on their island since ancient times, maintaining their spartan and technology-free existence, no one bats an eye when WW whips out, and expertly flies an invisible jet. I'm sorry what?! This woman has never even seen a mobile phone, but she can not only fly the height of technology, a fighter jet, she can do it without even seeing the controls (they're invisible after all).

There are frequent other times in the story that make no sense, treating the viewer like a idiot and demanding you just go with the flow. Sorry, I know I'm a grown man watching an animated film about a super powered immortal Amazon, but story is story, and it needs to make sense no matter how trivial the content may seem.

Finally the positives. Andrea Romano, who casts and directs the voice talent needs to be given a huge raise, now. She has done a great job in casting Kerri  Russel in the lead role. Kerri was excellent with her badly written character. Andrea is always spot on with her casting, and also illicites great performances from her cast. You never get over the top 'cartooney' voice acting under her watch.

The film also looks good. It's not as good as the Justice League: The New Frontier, but is slightly better than Superman: Doomsday. The character designs are good without being amazing or overly interesting. The animation is also of a high quality.

As much as I want more animated super hero films, if this is the quality I'm going to get I'd sooner have nothing. I highly recommend AGAINST buying this piece of tripe.",1237161600,19,2887,4.583333333333333
3684780,3,B001LK8TEM,"Visually, the animation looks great on the Blu-ray version, clear and crisp.  I thought this was an excellent retelling of Diana's origin story; it starts out with a bang, and it really establishes Diana's character and her universe. The only criticism I have is that personally, it took a long time for me to warm up to the Steve Trevor character, so it made many of the early foundational scenes with him drag.  I really felt his character sucked the life out of half the movie.  Once the pursuit of Ares really got going though, it was exceptional.

3684782,4,B001LK8TEM,"It seems fitting the folks at DC animation save what I feel is their best work for last. Beginning with Superman: Doomsday, followed by a DVD featuring anime renditions of the Dark Knight, the grand finale comes from an amazon princess born of clay. The DC Comics/DVD trinity is now complete and with a resounding bang.

The film takes a candid approach to telling the story of the Amazons and their warrior spirit. As if from a scene from Frank Miller's warrior epic 300, heroes fought and fell - and you see every skin piercing arrow draw blood. The dialog was candid, never hedging away from the phrasiology of the day. Touched with humor and realism, the voice actors were spot on with their interpretations. Archetypes, relations between men and women, their roles - those topics served as a backdrop for the entire story. Very well done. Arguably the best animation seen in a DC Comic based story.

As with all 2-Disc versions, special features have the promise of more details and producer commentary. This disc's features left a bit to be desired. Anyone who owns Gotham Knight saw New Frontier, already has the majoity of the speacial features held in this DVD - a bit lazy on DC's part, and I'd be willing to bet DC Comic executive Dan Didio, who is interviewed more than enough for the features, had something to do with keeping any cool features off the DVD - after all - he's the man responsible for keeping All-Star Wonder Woman (written a draw by Adam Hughes) off the comic rack. Special features worth watching were virtual social documentaries on the rise of Wonder Woman, but pointedly her creator and the issues which swirled during her creation and direction - very nice.

All in all, a must own for fans DC Comic fans, for I have a feeling, this is closest we are going to get to seeing a feature film featuring the Princess of the Amazons.",1236816000,3,1861,4.61631419939577

This is not an animated comic though for kids, it is violent at times but shows what would be real in the world if such things existed.

The story is basd allot on what and where Wonder Woman came from and the Greek Gods and so on.  Of course to make the movie more exciting or violent things were added but I really liked it and thought ""you go girl""!

Always enjoyed WW and love her strength in character as well as being one of the strongest of the DC Universe of the woman kind.  I liked the well known actors who portrayed the characters and was surprised that is had several very well known actors doing the voices.  In saying that I do recall more and more well know actors are doing voice over for all forms of animation.

I have no quams that I bought the blu-ray for $21 and change and will watch again over the years for sure.

I am surprised by some of the negative reviews, however, I am NOT a fan boy nor do I read allot of comics so some may have thir points to make as they have read the comics for years and had a different expectation?

As some say, rent it first, borrow it from a friend or read reviews and take the plunge.  I bought it as I am just a simple fan of this super hero and one of the few well known women of the DC Universe and a well done project in my opinion and some silly reminders of the live TV show.  Too bad they didn't ask or get Lynda Carter or even Cathy Lee Crosby to voice it.

3684785,4,B001LK8TEM,"I was never a huge fan of Wonder Woman; I just never found the whole ""island of the Amazons"" thing, or Steve Trevor, or any of the villains all that compelling.  Just my personal taste... I'm not saying the concept is deeply flawed or anything.  But since I've enjoyed several of the other recent DC direct-to-DVD animated features, I decided to buy this one anyway.  And I'm generally glad I did.

This 72-minute, nicely-animated film didn't turn me around, but I have to say I enjoyed it well enough.  Lots of spit and polish, good music, and a mature edge made it worth a viewing.  Also, the bonus features on the two-disc set were generous and entertaining.  Two documentaries, about 25 minutes each, work together to make a good case for the importance and impact of the character in both the comics industry and among the reading public at the time of her creation.  I also liked the sneak peak of the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" direct-to-DVD animated film, which is featured on both the single-disc and two-disc version of ""Wonder Woman"" (the docs I mentioned are only on the two-disc version).

In closing, true Wonder Woman aficionados might have a quibble or two (as another reviewer or two has pointed out, they never do explain where the invisible jet comes from), but will generally probably like this film a lot.  Myself, I thought the movie was pleasantly watchable, but I really enjoyed the thoughtful, in-depth documentaries that accompanied it.  Thus, I'm giving the DVD as a whole- the two-disc version- a strong recommendation.  If I bought the single-disc version containing the movie and little else, my report would be a little more lukewarm.",1236643200,2,1663,4.837455830388692

That's not to say that this movie or the updated character of Wonder Woman is without flaws.

The action and the animation is really good, but as some other reviewers noted some scenes are graphic showing blood and killings, and so if you have small kids it might disturb them. I thought that those scenes were appropriate, but I'm an adult.

And I found the story a little odd as well because the big battle happens between the amazons, Ares (the God Of War), and mythological creatures, and it all takes place in the present day in Washington D.C., at some very historical sites like the Vietnam Memorial wall and the Lincoln Memorial. But all of the modern people are absent from these scenes, including reporters, so that was very strange. I kept wondering where are the people? Where are the reporters? Where are the looky-loos with their camera phones?

Another pet-peeve was during the contest they didn't show ""bullets and bracelets,"" which was part of the amazon competition to find who would be the emissary to escort Trevor back to ""man's world,"" but they did show WW deflecting bullets when she comes into the city. And they don't show how Diana becomes WW, she's basically wearing the costume under her clothes like Superman. Boring! They should have done the spin or the lasso from the comics, to get her into her costume.

And the character herself seemed a little aloof. I was introduced to Wonder Woman through the Lynda Carter TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001ZMWYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and I read the comics during the 70s and 80s, but Carter's characterization is so firmly cemented in my brain and that might be why I find this character a little distant. Steve Trevor was a little annoying, too. But those are small problems.

Other than that, the movie is cool and the extras are worth it.

On DVD #2 you get:

3684787,2,B001LK8TEM,"As a rule, I always a rent a movie before I consider it worthy enough to buy it to watch again from time to time. In this case, I rented this DVD of Wonder Woman recently. I did saw Justice League: the New Frontier movie last year, and was very impressed with it (four stars). Sadly, this animated movie of Wonder Woman did not live up to my expectations. The Wonder Woman TV series is something I remembered for a long time and Lynda Carter who played Wonder Woman do always held a special place in my heart. I would say the Wonder Woman TV series was much better than the animated movie, especially when it comes to imitate real world situations, real life human interaction and communication, and real world politics. But who am I kidding to? The Wonder Woman video is, basically, a cartoon movie, and it seems only good enough for fanboys and people with arrested adolescent developments. The movie is definitely not for little kids or girls, due to the not-so-obvious nude scenes, the quite-so-obvious sexual connotations, the violent scenes with killing (with little or no blood shown) and beheading situations.

My biggest beefs with this animated movie are the script, the plot, and the dialogue/interaction between characters. Was the plot outlined and scripted by an adolescent while the movie was in production? How did intelligent people in this animation business let this ""crap"" (as Steve Trevor so fondly said often) flew right by, produced, assembled, finalized and distributed it en masse? There were exchanges in some scenes that rolled my eyes, the poor attempt in real-word conversations reduced the movie to college-level, frat-boy entertainment. Half of the time, I wanted to press ""stop"" and return the video back to the store, but the other half of me decided to suck it up and watched it to the very end, thanks to some well-done animation scenes (minus the dialogue, the plot and interactions). The final battle between Wonder Woman and Ares in, of all places, Washington, DC seems very outlandish and ridiculous but, again, this is a cartoon movie not for the little kids, but grrrreat for fanboys who grew up reading Wonder Woman comics and watching Superman, Batman and Justice League animations.

The message about bringing and promoting peace between men and women in a world of chaos, strife and war seems eternal but naive in this movie, but that's my opinion. The survival of men and women is based on human nature, not peace.

Few things I wanted to address to the creators of this Wonder Woman movie: first, this Steven Trevor in the movie does not do US Air Force personnel any justice, most USAF pilots are professional, upstanding, hard-working people who fly million-dollar aircraft in high-risk missions, and they do not speak and act like this sexist-pigish Steven Trevor character (George Perez's Steven Trevor character was way better in the revised WW comic series! Why the downgrade?). Second, there are few plot holes in the movie: where did the invisible jet or books in the Amazon Island come from? How did the Amazons speak in the 20th century language when they were separated and invisible from the man's world for few thousands years? Especially, how did Ares knows and speaks Latin when he is supposed to be a Greek god of war? Third, why reduce the language between men and women to the level of juvenile, chauvinistic connotations? Fourth, why the Amazons and Wonder Woman not aware of real world politics and diplomatic efforts by notable peoples working hard for peace? Lastly, why did you let an adolescent wrote the script for the movie and let it fly?!

Animation is well-done for the most parts. The juvenile-laden script and plot holes killed it. Great for fanboys, not great for the little kids and girls. I await the day when a live-version movie of Wonder Woman come out very professionally done, with real-world connotations and grown-up adult interaction (when if it has to come to the absurd, tiresome ""battle of the sexes"", *sigh*).",1236556800,9,4002,4.8808823529411764

The movie is solid in every single aspect: story, voice casting and acting, plot, action, humor and very true to the characters specially the young Amazon princess Diana A.K.A. as Wonder Woman. For harcore DC comics fans who shyed away from previous releases as being not good in some aspects this one is the one to own and watch again and again.it is very well balanced with plot and action and never bores you.

It is very true to the character and makes use of all her powers, the movie's rating of PG-13 is due to the action and some violent sequences and some inuendos in the dialogue but is never explicit or too graphic.

The two disks edition has many great documentaries including a biography of Wonder Woman's creator, the same man who helped develop in real life the lie detector machine, hence her golden lasso of truth.

The action scenes were greatly executed and the animation was smooth, just as it was in the Justice League series.  I loved the fight scenes and there were great displays of just exactly what Wonder Woman/Diana is capable of.

I was, however, a little surprised at how the origin story was altered because I especially love the reboot origin George Perez gave Diana.  I wanted more of the gods and goddesses to have played a role in the creation of the Princess of Power and endowment of Diana's abilities.

It was also a mistake to show that Diana is unable to fly on her own without the aid of the famous/infamous invisible plane in this movie, which is one of the biggest departures from her original 1940s origin and the one ability of Wonder Woman that I really missed seeing in this film.  It is not only iconic for today's Wonder Woman to be able to fly on her own and but also symbolic on so many levels because her power of flight essentially establishes that Diana does not need any assistance from anyone or anything -- like Superman -- to take to the skies.  It's especially jarring since in the Justice League series, this was a nonstarter.

There could also have been more explanation as to how Diana earned the name ""Wonder Woman"" but that's a minor quibble.

But since this is probably the closest we'll get to a full-fledged Wonder Woman film, I'm happy with the movie but for the reasons stated above.  Let's hope that there are follow-up films.

For starters, the animation is top notch.  I was immediately drawn into the movie by the epic battle scenes, which were exactly that...epic.  The voice casting was fairly well done.  Virginia Madsen was spot on as Hippolyta.  While I didn't exactly love Keri Russell as Diana, I didn't hate her, either.  Her voice is strong enough but she seemed a little too monotone, to me anyway.

The storyline was good.  The action scenes were balanced well with drama & surprising moments of comedy, which made me laugh out loud.  I found Steve Trevor to be a little irritating & I can't see why someone like Diana would fall for him, which is why I gave the movie only 4 stars.  Also, I don't believe they ever explained the invisible jet.  I mean, if they've been essentially cut off from ""man's world"" for hundreds of years, where did the get the technology for the jet?

The special features include previews of the new Green Lantern movie, due to be released this summer, which looks very good.  Previews of the Dark Knight animated movie, already released.  Documentaries on the making of this move & the creation of the Wonder Woman comics.  I found them very interesting.

He sees Amazons playing and splashing naked in a paddling pool--why are they not portrayed as doing something strong and athletic?

This is better than ""Justice League, the New Frontier"" and better than Superman's Doomsday (The Death of Superman) movie.

The show begins with an exceptionally well animated and choreographed war scene between Ares the god of war and the Amazons and the action does not stop.  This was the most action packed of all of the recent direct to DVD affairs from the comic companies...yes marvels ULTIMATE AVENGERS included.

I know that was the original WW in the late 40's all the way to the 70's but that changed in the 80's if I remember well. Now WW not only can fly but she is as fast as Superman when flying.  What is with the silly see through jet that nobody cared to see in the movie?

Not even mention her strength, in some scenes she is super strong but in others she needs to be saved by Steve, in fact she was saved by him so many times that got boring and kind of humiliating. How come the male super heroes in DC movies don't' need to be saved by others but the poor, overlooked, defendless only woman, that was one of the original members of the Justice Society of America and after that the Justice League, needs to be saved all the time? It's just very annoying and disappointed, in this movie she is not other than weak.

Why would they make previous JLA animated movies showing a more powerful WW and on this one the decided to do a weaker one? I don't get it. This is why WW has been overlooked all these years beacuse her powers, abillities and story are always changing.....they should come up with a more permanent one like Superman has. You will never see a Superman movie where his powers are different, we get pretty much the same story, powers, background, etc., with him; so why should we get different versions with WW?  At least if they are going to change her try to do her better and not worst, more appealing for the new generations. It is hard for a female super heroe to be popular and sell comics among the young audience and if they choose to go with just an average WW with nothing especial then people will not be interested anymore.

And last but not least, the story is kind of boring also, not very creative, making the Amazons to look more like mercenaries never searching for justice and peace. If they make a new movie hopefully they correct all these terrible mistakes.",1236124800,9,1987,4.302139037433155
3684800,5,B001LK8TEM,This was awesome.  When do we get 'Wonder Woman:The Animated Series'? There is major potential here!,1236124800,,100,5.25
3684801,5,B001LK8TEM,"Born from earth of Themyscira (the invisible paradise island of Amazonian women) touched by the blood of her mother Hippolyta and the power of the Greek goddess Hera, Princess Diana is the world's greatest female warrior, but she is forbidden to leave the island and experience the world of man. The delicate balance of the Amazons is thrown out of whack, however, when a male pilot crash lands on their secret home and the mad god Ares escapes from their own prison. A contest is held to decide who will return pilot Col. Steve Trevor to the strange land of America, and to that winner is soon added the mission of finding and defeating Ares in battle before he can spread his evil bloodlust out of control. Of course, Diana is the victor and given the dangerous task, along with some flashy, powerful, and legendarily sexy gear, and Wonder Woman is born! But that's just half of her story, and her introduction to the modern world, growing relationship with Steve Trevor, and pursuit/battle with Ares and his minions are just as intriguing!

Wonder Woman finally gets a film of her own in the new direct-to-DVD animated feature from Warner Premiere animation, and it's probably the best thing they've done so far, which is saying quite a lot! While the similar line of direct-to-DVD animated features from Marvel is pretty good and improving, Warner's DC comics animated films have the fantastic Bruce Timm behind them and all have been excellent. Though Timm's credit is not to undermine that of the directors, in this case Lauren Montgomery who also directed the excellent ""Superman: Doomsday"". Her attention to details and respect for the characters really resulted in something awesome here in ""Wonder Woman"", and the film is both beautiful to watch and great, great entertainment! Whether you're a longtime Wonder Woman fan or new to her whole world, this film is sure to please as long as you don't mind animation that is more mature than what U.S. studios usually provide. Now, I don't mean ""mature"" in every sense of the word, but in comparison to what one usually gets from animated features in the States. We get some uncompromising violence and (subtle) adult subject matter with hardly any ""American animation trying to be adult"" awkwardness. What I mean is, we thankfully hardly get any of that cheese factor that results from Americans not feeling too sure about how to write adult dialogue for animation. This time around, everything flows very naturally and believably, resulting in an overall much better film! You have to not think about the fact that the film you are writing for is animated (and therefore, according to much American thinking, ""for kids"", *pfft*), and the writers behind Wonder Woman seem to have pulled that off! Of course, the voice talent helps a lot too, and boy, does this film have some big names! Keri Russell stars as Wonder Woman (yeah, I had a thing for her back in the day too), Nathan Fillion is Col. Steve Trevor, Alfred ""Doc Oc"" Molina plays the villainous Ares, Rosario Dawson is Amazonian warrior Artemis, Virginia Madsen is Hippolyta, and Oliver Platt is Hades to name a few! Oh, and to address a common concern I'm sure, Wonder Woman is truly gorgeous and sexy in this film, different but not too different from how she was in the Justice League animated TV series from a few years back. Let's face it, some artists draw the Amazon princess and her sisters a bit scary, but no worries here! Now, I just hope they make a sequel and bring Wonder Girl into the cast! And if you're thinking, ""Oh, this is just another superhero origin story,"" stop right there! I know what you're saying, but the Wonder Woman origin, with its basis in Greek myth, is so different from most superhero origin stories, so original, that even if you're tired of superhero films that are origin stories, you are not likely to be bored by this one or feel you have seen it a hundred times before. This is one you need to check out!

Now, I personally bought the Blu-Ray release myself, even though I still don't have an HDTV. I have a PS3 and figure I might as well be buying Blu-Rays already. It can be hard to read Blu-Ray menus on standard def TVs sometimes, but Wonder Woman's wasn't too bad. The widescreen visuals are fantastic, of course, even on standard, and we get a great filmmaker commentary option (director Montgomery has a lovely voice). Plus, we get two great featurettes on the creation of Wonder Woman and her relation to ancient myth. There's also the First Look promo for the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" animated feature and old First Look promos from previous releases (including this one). These are great because they're sort of little ""Making-of"" featurettes. But the big surprise is that 4 bonus TV episodes from the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited are included as well. Okay, maybe that's not a big deal if you already have those DVD sets, but I don't yet (They're on my list though). The first is a two-parter from Justice League entitled ""Paradise Lost"", the other two are from Justice League Unlimited: ""Hawk and Dove"" and ""To Another Shore"". These are all episodes that feature Wonder Women prominently and deal with myth. Great stuff! I believe two of these are only on the Blu-Ray. Also, the Blu-Ray comes with a digital copy, though to me those are just extra junk and I'd have preferred a standard def copy as an extra.

So, when all is said and done, this is another great animated feature from Warner and DC, and I hope they keep on comin', because they just get better and better! Hope to see more from Wonder Woman too. This is a feature that I believe will please most viewers (who don't have a problem with the violence). Sure, some will be looking for something deeper and some hardcore fanatics will still find something to nitpick on in regards to comic canon, but overall ""Wonder Woman"" is a crowd pleaser and a winner!",1236124800,3,5898,4.724271844660194
3684802,5,B001LK8TEM,"i have always been a fan of WW as well as Batman.  they are the only things about DC i have always Cared about (But Supergirl is getting there.) and with all the hype ol' Bats has been getting over the past couple of years i'm Glad Wonder Woman is Finally getting her time to prove why she one of the Greatest character in all of Comic Book Superhero world.
the Movie was very good. the animation was good but WB has always done a great jobs with the DC. the story was well done and pretty much followed the genesis of the Wonder Woman epic with only a few minor details either ommited of changed around - did not really distract me from liking the movie anymore or less of it.  there was a lot of violence then the JLA series usually had and it did not shy away from lettiing you know that an enemy or friend was killed even by WW. i don't mean they talked about it but you knew it happened and it could not be avoided.
they had the right amount of humor in it that wasn't getting in the way of the story too much and it wasn't patronizing but if the moive was a little longer the humor touches might have worn out its welcome.
i'm glad i bought the Blue-ray edition of this because i will want to watch it again. and i will look foward to any others animated movies about her that comes my way.
the extras are great two. 4 episodes of the JLA animated series that centered around her. and two Documentaries about the Histroy of Wonder Woman and William Marston Moultan;the creator of Wonder Woman and the other Documentary about the Mythology that was the Inspiration for her creation. which is why i started reading her in the first place. she had the best Myth story for any superhero.  plus there is also a nice little behind the scenes/making of movie segment.
Overall, it was quite an experince i had with this. Very much enjoyed this - i reccommend this highly.",1236124800,2,1869,4.259154929577464

The fight scenes were amazing but VERY brutal!  Chopping heads off and overall sword fighting would be WAY too much for little DC fans!  My 6 year old son has seen other ""PG-13"" movies (Iron Man and Transformers) but this was a little too much.
LOVED IT and hope it leads to it's own series!!!  It's time for a little DC girl power.  Batman and Superman have had their own shows, lets get WW on scene!",1236124800,2,572,4.25
3684804,4,B001LK8TEM,"Finally, Wonder Woman has her own animated movie. Now where is her animated series? The pros heavily outweigh the cons in this latest adaptation and it couldn't have come soon enough for many die-hard fans. The animation, acting, story, and overall production is great. The only problems I had with it were Diana's personality - she was traditionally warmer than the rest of the amazons (though the greatest warrior of them all) and I found this incarnation to be a little rough around the edges. I also didn't like that her mother, Hippolyta, looked so much like her. I also prefer the traditional WWII era story as depicted in the 1970's live action series, but oh well. I also didn't believe how easily Steve Trevor accepted all of this fantastic mythological phenomenon happening all around him, from discovering a hidden island inhabited solely by women to an epic battle led by Ares the god of war. 74 minutes seemed too short. Still, this feature is way better than Batman Gotham Knight, and in many ways superior to Superman:Doomsday as well. The champ of recent DC animated features, however, is Justice League: The New Frontier. I hope Wonder Woman gets a weekly series out of this, or dare I say, a new franchise of live-action films.

3684805,5,B001LK8TEM,"The newest installment in the Bruce Timm DC animated film library is none other than the greatest Super Heroine in comic book history. Wonder Woman, the legendary Amazonian princess is given her first in depth origin story. This is a first for many comic book and DC animated universe fans alike and it is done in a fan appreciative manor.

This story takes the fan favorite Wonder Woman stories and meshes them altogether in traditional Bruce Timm story telling, relatiable characters and an excellent voice cast. I would never have imagined that the well known Kerri Russel was able to portray such a strong heroine. Yet, this is an origin story so it is a much younger version of the character so it makes sense to bring a voice that can be transformed into a much stronger voice through time. The other cast memebers consist of Alfred Molina, Virginia Madesen and Rosario Dawson (to name a few). The outlay of the story is not constant brooding darkness, but it is a mature story so there are some real topics and often humerous moments that make it very real.

Bruce Timm, is really taking full advantage of these films. His films are not always made with the pure satisfactory of the fans in mind. These are chances to show new innovative portrayals of the DC animated universe. Each film has a different mood, different style and never the same actors twice. I think that's what makes me want to see these films because they are different. The next film on the horizon is a new twist on Green Lantern. If you pick up the double disk there is an excellent documentry on the new project and because of this new innovative story they have in store for us, I cannot wait.",1236124800,2,1674,4.576666666666667
3684806,5,B001LK8TEM,"Wonder Woman is the 4th release from DC's Animated Movies line, following Batman: Gotham Knight, New Frontier, and Superman: Doomsday. This is an origin story detailing Wonder Woman's first encounter with man's world, her relationship with pilot Steve Trevor and her quest to stop the God of War Ares from crushing humanity.

This is, by far, one of the best direct-to-video efforts you'll watch in a long, long time. Usually with these ""B-level"" animated films you'll find at least one key element missing - whether it be a plodding and cliched script, weak animation, or half-hearted voice acting. Wonder Woman sidesteps all of these pitfalls. The story is an original creation (credited to acclaimed writers Gail Simone & Michael Jelenic), and not an over-crammed adaptation of some mega comic arc. It finds time to introduce the Amazons, setup the origin elements, show Diana's culture shock in her new surroundings, develop the supporting cast, add a romance sub-plot, develop and further the plans of the villains, and also stuff in tons of exciting action sequences on top of everything else.

The voice cast shines. Keri Russell makes a great Wonder Woman. Whereas I felt it took the prior ""Justice League"" incarnation of Wonder Woman a season or two to truly find her voice, Russell's inflections nail equal parts inner strength, femininity, and naivet depending on Wonder Woman's situation. Fan favourite Nathan Fillion is much the same scoundrel hero he frequently plays, and it lends to a cool, modernized interpretation of Steve Trevor as well as add comic relief. Alfred Molina's Ares rounds out the main trio in the way great enemies should: calm, confident, and always threatening.

DC animation has been consistently topping itself in terms of mature storytelling since the Batman animated series premiered in the 90s, and Wonder Woman carries on that tradition in multiple ways. There's the brutal action sequences that range from massive Greek epics to traditional hero-versus-villain fights; the dialogue is peppered with innuendo and mature references from line one, and the script hits all the gender issues Wonder Woman is known for raising.  Bottom line, there's a lot for fans of mature animation here. Probably not suitable for all ages, but it's great WB gets the older demographic.

If you can't already tell, this is a must-see adventure. Wonder Woman has traditionally been one of the hardest heroes to adapt, and this DTV does her proud. Bravo.",1236038400,3,2475,5.146766169154229

However, iTunes is asking for a redemption code found on the insert of the DVD. My set didn't come with an insert. Did anyone else have this problem?",1236038400,,271,4.44
3684808,3,B001LK8TEM,"Created in 1941 by American scientist William Marston (with assists from his wife Elizabeth and their polyamourous lover Olive Byrne), Diana of Themyscira, Wonder Woman, has become one of the most famous heroes in comics.  She is usually counted among the ""Big Three"" of DC, her owners, alongside Superman and Batman.  This is, however, illusory in many respects; the character has never received even a fraction of the popular or creator attention of her alleged compeers (having, for example, to settle for a supporting role in Bruce Timm's own DC Animated Universe when the others got series of their own).  This is the first new solo Wonder Woman project in any medium apart from comics in more than thirty years.

As mentioned, Timm and co. have worked with the character before, on ""Justice League Unlimited"", an exercise which was frankly a disastrous adaptation of the character.  Stripped of her personality and most of the important parts of her origin, with her villains and supporting cast either not there at all or bland ciphers, very little of what made the character great came through there.  I was apprehensive approaching this DVD, because, while a huge fan of Timm's animation, his track record with Wonder Woman is not good.  It was also hardly encouraging for writer Michael Jelenic to admit to not having known anything about the character before he was assigned to the film.  I should say, some spoilers are to be found.

The basic plot, as has been outlined in the other reviews here, is in common with Diana's previous comics origin stories:  Ares, God of War (Mars, in Marston's original version) is loose and out to destroy the world, and it is up to the champion of his rivals in the Greek Pantheon to stop him.  The Amazons, mythical race of warrior women, hold a contest to determine who will face the threat, and Diana, defying her mother's wishes, enters and wins.  Whether or not she is accompanied by Steve Trevor as a love interest varies; here, she is.  Nothing revolutionary here, but there's no reason to radically change a solid and important story (which Timm and co. did in JLU).

The animation is beautiful; by far the best stuff in any of the DC DVDs they've done so far. The Wonder Woman design is appreciably Greek, athletic and powerful while still very beautiful (though DC's own artists have a hard time rendering this version of the design consistently on the posters and other promotional material; compare the covers of the single- and two-disk versions of this DVD) and many other characters, such as Artemis, are rendered more or less perfectly.  The film can also be pretty funny, and it's pretty bloody, too; the battle scenes are close to flawless.  This is easily the finest action yet depicted onscreen in DC's animated efforts, which is quite a high bar to clear.  Bettering JLU, there's a more serious take on the character's mythology here, both in terms of the actual Greek mythology and Themysciran society, which in this case is inhabited by some actual characters with more than one dimension, rather than a bunch of drones lorded over by Diana's undeveloped mother.

And now we arrive at the parts of the story where the writers are asked to really interpret the character, and, once again, they trip (though on the whole I'd say not as badly). Sigh.  I know (moreso than most, even) that Wonder Woman as a character has had a lot of different takes over her 70-year history, but in the broad scheme of things, there are in fact thematic elements that have been consistent from Marston onward. One of these, and really chief to the whole character, is that the Amazons are a superior and enlightened society who prize culture and the arts as high as martial prowess, love peace, and are meant to bring it to the wider world and save it. Get that through your skulls, Timm and co: superior society. Not ""bloodthirsty Xena clones"" and ""strawman feminist"". Because that's more or less what they are here, just like in JL/U. They're aggressively misandrist, to a point that they'e never been in the comics outside of abortions like Amazons Attack. If anything, they learn a valuable lesson on tolerance from Steve Trevor. They've got no philosophy or higher ideas here.

Speaking of Steve Trevor, he's back in his Silver Age form, ie, sexist cad. Why do writers keep thinking a feminist hero should fall in love with a cad who is constantly making jokey, piggish advances? I mean, if you want him as a love interest instead of the Perez version, at least go with Perez's take on his personality: Post-Crisis Steve was a competent, gentlemanly fellow.

On the subject of Diana's power levels; getting the thing that most people will talk about out of the way, she can't fly, which is lame (because creators are all obsessed with that stupid jet), but not insurmountable; the bigger issue is that her power levels are wildly inconsistent. When she first meets Steve, they get into a fist fight, at which he, in another unbelievable moment, actually holds his own for a bit, both in terms of martial arts proficiency and knocking her around. In other scenes (such as the clip they've shown online of her fighting Deimos), she's a mid-tier bruiser, throwing guys through walls and punching them across the room.  Jelenic seems desperate to avoid any suggestion that Steve isn't Diana's equal in order to not offend male audience members, which is a terrible way to approach this sort of thing; Steve is not Diana's equal in combat in the slightest, nor should he have to be.

Setting aside these things (which, apart from power levels, are subjective, I suppose), parts of the plot/character-interaction are just baffling. Consider, after winning the Contest while in disguise to avoid her mother's ban on entering, Diana unmasks before the crowd and her mother, the Queen, who...has no reaction to this, whatsoever. That's a pivotal moment in the story, but Hippolyta just blankly offers congratulations.  This has always been a key moment in the characters' relationship, but instead, there's nothing.

Timm's best work (ie, most of it) shows audiences the core of his heroes, what makes them unique and awesome as characters. Jelenic, the writer, mentioned something along these lines in his interviews: when talking about Hippolyta, he described her as ""almost Wonder Woman, but she isn't, which leads you to the question of why isn't she Wonder Woman? What is is about her and Diana that makes Diana Wonder Woman?""

Jelenic never answers his own question. The war with Ares ultimately requires of Diana nothing that her mother couldn't have done, or Artemis (and not just because the Amazons all have the same powers here); absolutely anybody can use the Lasso of Truth here (indeed, it's Hippolyta's), and the defeat of Ares comes when Diana kills him with her sword.

Ooooh, nobody else could have done that. Except they can, and they do.

The contrast with George Perez's work in ""Gods & Mortals"" is just jarring here; Perez and later writers (such as Byrne, whose work on the character I find problematic in a lot of respects, did a lot of good in this respect) connect Diana's lasso with something inherent in her character, her devotion to Truth. When Perez's Diana faced down the God of War, she couldn't defeat him physically; instead, she realized that that wouldn't work, and instead she uses the lasso to show him that if he gets his wish to unleash ultimate war on the world in the nuclear age, he'll destroy the world, and thus all his worshippers, and, ultimately, he and the other gods will die too. That's something that nobody else could have done; that's why it was crucial that Wonder Woman save the world. Superman would have failed there; Batman would have failed; the rest of the JLA would have failed. It's Diana's wisdom (sufficient to outreason a god) and her special truth power that save the day.

I mean, it's great that they depict her as a great combatant, but that's the bare minimum for any superhero; we go a bit further here by having her and the other Amazons unapologetically use lethal force (suck on that, Geoff Johns), which is a bonus. But, fundamentally, the creators' answer here for what makes Wonder Woman cool and unique as a superhero is that she beats people up real good. The lasso is just an accessory that they use as fodder for jokes about people telling the truth a la ""Liar Liar"", rather than something that says something profound about her.

Maturity is more than just showing blood and making titty jokes; it's frustrating, when writers have laid the groundwork for a far more adult and intelligent Wonder Woman, one that wouldn't run afoul of any censor, Timm and his very talented associates seem incapable of taking us there.",1236038400,208,8748,4.816544362908606

Don't get me wrong, the cast was great, the animation was beautiful, the overarching storyline was neat. But the writing is lazy. Steve Trevor is a misogynist and Diana is - or becomes - a misandrist.
