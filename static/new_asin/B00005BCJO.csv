1421516,4,B00005BCJO,"Big O is just one of those series that has both anime purists and casual fans split down the middle.  Those against it attack its similarity to the Batman cartoon, as well as the cliche'd human-android relationship.  Those for it cite the impeccable style and depth of the plotline, which may escape those who see only one or two episodes.
Although I myself am a big fan of Big O, I thought that the first four episodes did well to start off the series, but it could have been better.  I advise those that buy this dvd to no hesitate and buy the other Big O dvd's when they are released, as this series is nothing unless you view all of the episodes.
This rating is of This particular dvd, and not the series as a whole.  Mind you, the last few episodes are what make the whole series a classic, at least from this person's point of view.

1421517,5,B00005BCJO,"I kid you not. This is an excellent, well-crafted, brilliant piece of animation. The character design is familiar, yet creative and striking. The mecha design is campy, even schmaltzy, yet in that fun super-hero, retro kind of way that is the perfect blend of art-deco and big hunk o'robot combined in one. You will know this anime is different as soon as you see and hear the opening theme.
A sense of gothic, noir darkness pervades the whole series, yet it's never depressing, and never truly black, and every scene just drips with style, whether it be Roger's broad-shouldered, nip-waisted coat and boot cut pants, or Angel's pink catsuit and perfectly coiffed hair.
The humor is impeccably timed, present in mere glances of the eye of characters, or the inflection of voices. You will love each character as soon as you meet them (or love to hate them, as the case may be).
You will recognize elements of Batman, 007, and who knows what else in this series--you will also immediately recognize it is like nothing you have ever seen before, and you will be aching for more after the 13 episodes are through. I have read preview reviews for this DVD, and it is ranked as excellent in quality and truly beautiful, so this is a sound anime investment if there ever was one.
I cannot recommend this series enough, and consumers must let the producers know we are ravenous for the completion of this fine work. To never know the outcome of this series would be an immense disappointment for many, many animation fans and the anime genre as a whole.",990230400,2,1546,4.666666666666667
1421518,5,B00005BCJO,"Welcome to Paradigm City, a city of Amnesia, named after  Paradigm, the company that is both Church and State in the City. Forty years ago something happened, something that wiped out the memories of everyone in the city and the history of what happened before. As far as anyone knows, Paradigm City is the last city on earth. Paradigm is also a city divided, the rich and the lucky live in climate controled domes, while the poor and less fortunate live in the rundown buildings outside the domes.
One of those living outside of the Domes is Roger Smith, The Negotiator. Roger is part PI, part trouble shooter, part crime fighter and part playboy. He is a man of Honor, respected for his dedication and his honesty. Once he takes a job, he sees it throught to the end. In his black doublebreasted suits and black sunglasses Roger stands out in any crowd and exudes a sense of professionalism. For Roger, the job is not about money, but is about people. His respectful and humane approach to his assignments and the people he is dealing with, makes him even more likable and often gives him an edge in facing what is to come. Lately his life has been complicated by two ladies.
Dorothy Wainwright, aka R Dorothy Wainwright. Dorothy is an android, created in the image of the real Dorothy by her father, complete with her memories. She is far more than a machine but less than human. How much less then human, is a question that both Roger and the audience are often left pondering. From kidnap victim, to client, to Roger's assistant, she becomes a big part of Roger's life in a very short time. Their relationship is fun to watch and leaves you wanting more. Especially as Dorothy asks Roger some tough questions about life and love.
Angel, the other woman complicating Rogers life. A name changing mystery woman, she quietly moves up in the ranks of Paradigm. She hires Roger to negotiate the reopening of a power plant in 'Electric City'. After completing her mission, she tells Roger to call her 'Angel'. Her past, her purposes, her goals are all a  mystery. When she appears in Roger's life, it means nothing but trouble for him and Big O.
Norman Burg, A Gentleman's Gentleman and Roger's chief keeper. Norman maintains both Roger's House and 'Big O'. It is Norman, who presents Dorothy to Roger as his new assistant and is happy to have her help in taking care of 'Master Roger'.
Major Dan Dastun is Roger's friend and former commander. Roger goes to him for information, from time to time. He is dedicated to protecting all of Paradigm City and hates it when 'Big O' dukes it out with an opponent, because of the devasation the battles leave in their wake.
'Big O' is a Megadeus class Attack Robot, piloted by Roger Smith. Big, Black, armed with an array of weapons and a devastating 1-2 punch, compliments of the piledrivers in it's arms. Big O is impressive. It's literally groundbreaking entrances are thanks to an underground train that delivers it to the site of the battle and then brings it home. The battles are waged without the silliness of other shows. There is no prancing, no posturing, no transformations or evolving into a new forms during the battles. Just hard hitting and fast paced action, with the battles being won through a combination Big O's strenght and toughness and Roger's skill, cunning and determination. Together, Roger and Big O stand in defense of Paradigm City, protecting it from criminals, mutant monsters, rogue robots, mad scientists and mad men.
From the start, Big O's visual style, mood setting music and style of story telling, grabs the viewers and draws them into the world of Paradigm City. This is a show that appeals to the kid inside of all of us and is just plain fun to watch.",990057600,,3733,4.663125948406677
1421519,5,B00005BCJO,"""The Big O"" is easily the best anime series to come along in the past ten years. It's film noir anime, with retro-styled characters and mecha, similar, somewhat, to ""Giant Robo"". However, with a complex and intriguing plotline, fully-realised characters, moody music, and a sense of humor that borders on sarcastic, ""The Big O"" strikes just the right note, blending many of the familiar with just a little bit of the unique to create a series that simply blew me away. I've not been this excited about watching anime in about 15 years.
Please, Bandai & Sunrise, produce more episodes! I'll be purchasing this DVD and any other ""Big O"" merchandise you have to offer.",989020800,6,665,4.791304347826087
1421520,5,B00005BCJO,"I stumbled into Big O completely by accident, but after watching my first episode, I have never missed it once.  It is an incredibly entertaining show that focuses on Negotiator, Roger Smith and his giant robot, Big O.  The characters are well developed and dynamic, I have yet to find a character that is flat or not intriguing.  The story line to Big O is full of twists and turns, and it is one of the few shows on television that is thought provoking.  The animation style combined with the music creates a haunting and beautiful atmosphere that engulfs you in the world of Paradigm City. My only complaint is that there were only 13 episodes produced.  Perhaps if people purchase this DVD it will entice the shows creators to produce more episodes, and perhaps reveal ""The Event"" that lead to Paradigm City's amnesia. This DVD is a must for any anime fans or just anyone that likes a great story.",988848000,2,901,4.571428571428571
1421521,5,B00005BCJO,"This anime as a previous review stated has been showing in place of Outlaw Star - an equally good show on Cartoon Network's Toonami.  However, I don't understand is why the audience is left with 13 measely episodes.  Toonami has been playing them over and over. I don't know if they haven't produced anymore after this or what, I checked around and it seems that's it for Big O.

 Just when it was getting good too.  The whole premise is set in a futuristic, dark demolished world, mainly the only city known of at this time - Paradigm.  Gigantic bio domes clouds some of the city where the rich and lucky folk inhabit.  The life outside is harsh, thanks to an event that happened 40 yrs. ago that wiped minds clean.  Everything destroyed, people couldn't recall anything so they just live life dealing with what's left, or most of them.  Roger Smith comes into play because he ""negotiates"" with clients ; People who can recall bits and pieces or all of their past.  They make requests such as a search for a lost relative or treasure etc.  Gradually, through Roger's adventures into finding recollections of people's past we learn of a conspiracy that's oddly related to the 40 yr. event.  I felt that the ending was way to rushed, at the 13th episode it's a climatic showdown of learning the true meaning of why everything is the way it is.  Why Roger seems unaffected, and other unanswered inquiries.  There seems like their should be at least a few more episodes to wrap it up.

Animation is done in soft, muted colors to give it a dank oppressed feel for the world.  I love the sleek more realistic character design, very gorgeous and reminescent of Batman.  Engaging characters, and a charming hero with common sense for once.

 Only annoyance is this DVD holds 4 episodes.  ...But get it anyway it's worth at least for sexy Roger.",988156800,,1837,4.593846153846154
1421522,5,B00005BCJO,"In Short the big O is pretty darn good. Imagine Batman driving around an enormous robot with seemingly limitless power, lots of fights, explosions, and neat music. The visual style is stupendous with animation that has a anime feel to it but looks very american too.(once again the Batman series from the early 90's, remember the one with the realistic animation and dark overtones. Then add a japanese influence to it). ASide from Looks and cool fight factor, big O has a complex and twisting storyline. If only the series had been finished anyways. Many episodes foreshadow future events or revelations that wwere never developed, and only hinted at. The series jsut kinda ends o na big [...] cliffhange, and thats it. The show seems only ok, until you've seen it all, then you can piece togeether some of the stuff from the first few episodes and it STARTS to make sense.  Altho it's like only 1/2 a series was created, whatever happened to the other half i dunno.  So after you watch it, and get hooked on it you must do 2 things. A) Buy the dvd or vhs versions when they come out B) CALL, WRITE, STALK BANDAI CARTOON NETWORK and SUNRISE Entertainment, and tell them to make more BIG-O episodes. Say Yo! I need My O!
So watch it and see if you like it, if yer mildly interested get Vol2 and so on. If you wanna know the truth. You can technically just buy vol. 4 and get all the info you need about the story in 1 great little chunk. But don't do that, that would be cheating. THis series reminds me of a cowboy bebop that almost was. WHY WONT THEY FINISH IT. JUST FOR ME? maybe if i make puppy dog eyes at em they will.",987984000,,1624,4.356435643564357
1421523,4,B00005BCJO,"Big O recently started showing on Cartoon Network's Toonami afternoon block of action cartoons and is already a hit. If its art and animation style remind you of Batman: The Animated Series, that's because the same animation team is responsible for both series.
There are also plot similarities, especially in the main character--freelance negotiator Roger Smith in a rich playboy/hero role reminiscent of Bruce Wayne--and his helping butler Norman. Adding flavor is Dorothy, an android modeled after a deceased young girl. Her dour expression and monotone voice never change, yet she still conveys some very human qualities in her growing affection for Roger, who takes her on in the pilot episode as his partner.
The show's snicker-inducing title comes from Big O, a giant robot Roger calls to aid him in his battles.  The story takes place in Paradigm City, the last city left on Earth after some unknown cataclysm.  All of the city's inhabitants mysteriously lost their memories 40 years ago, and the episodes are set against a theme of the citizens having come to terms with their lack of a history.
The mood is dark and depressing with a lot of wah-wah bluesy music, but the show is gripping and has interesting characters and plots. I highly recommend giving it a try.",987638400,9,1275,4.953271028037383

1421539,3,B00005BCJO,"I love Big O! Probably one of my favorite series of all time. Anime Legends, however, changed the opening song from ""Big O"" by Rui Nagai to ""Big-O! Show Must Go On"" Rui Nagai. Although the copy righted date for the DVDs say they're from prior to 2007, the release date of the DVDs is June 19, 2007. This is somewhat irritating to the same vein as seeing Hayden Christensen showing up in the end of Return of the Jedi. Anyone can understand why George Lucas did that, but no one wanted him to after people were still groaning over the Special Editions, the era of Star Wars I grew up on. Though before even knowing about the change of Big O's intro, I for a long time had the original opening on my ipod. I loved watching it and listening to the music, it was one of the few ways I was able to still enjoy one of my favorite shows even though it wasn't on TV anymore. Even if the series was based on Batman in some light, the fact remains that the tone of Batman the animated series stood alone from the original 60s series. They are two different series with different conveyance of feeling. This rings true for just watching episode seven of this DVD collection. It threw me off guard to hear the new intro pop up in the middle of the show. The original theme was far more fitting, now I feel like I'm watching some overly campy Giant Robo show and that DiaGurad and Mazinger Z are going to pop out of no where and start teaming up to save the universe. This show never felt like it was meant to be campy. It's like if Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in a shell had random points where it went Chibi like in Bleach or Naruto.

Though despite this issue that bothers me to no end, it's still Big O. The intro theme, if memory serves correct, is hardly used in the rest of the series (at least withing the bulk of the episodes that is). If you showed this same thing to a kid now, they wouldn't care. That is one thing we all should remember. Most of us enjoyed this as kids, and I rather not tell a kid ""this is how it should be"" because we have gotten that from our elders and we didn't care to listen.

So it's three stars for the DVDs, but the series always earns a five out of five from me!",1377648000,,2184,4.124413145539906
1421540,4,B00005BCJO,This is an awesome show.  Batman meets mecha with some twists and turns.  I recommend it to all my friends.,1376956800,,107,4.3
1421541,5,B00005BCJO,I bought this as a gift.  It worked fine.  I didn't watch it however the person I gave it to said it was good.,1364774400,,110,3.5416666666666665
1421542,5,B00005BCJO,"Do you like Batman?  Giant robots?  Mysteries?  Well then this series is for you.  Big O as far as Anime goes is in my top ten series right now.

FYI, this is still currently on Cartoon Network, airing on Sundays early in the morning.  You would have to be on the night shift like me or have a DVR to watch it though.  Comes on at like 3:00 or 4:00 am I believe.

Anyway, what is this series about you ask?  Well it is sci fi oriented, and mostly occurs in Paradym City.  Paradym City is a large doom city where all the more fortunate people live.  Everyone in the series has no memories back before 40 years ago.  Something happened that wiped everyones hard drives so to speak.

Roger Smith, the main character, who is rich and a vigilante like Batman, is a negoiater.  (My spelling sucks...Amazon please install spell check...)  He basically barters deals between two parties of people.  Usually not very nice people.  Think of him as the Transporter.

Well when things fall threw on deals, and they usually do, he calls into action Big O his giant robot.  For some odd reason the bad guys usually have robots also.  Thus robot fighting commences with Roger always winning.

That's just for starters though.  There are a lot of mysteries in this city, and it seems many powerful people are trying desperately to piece their lost history back together.  This takes Roger down some dangerous roads.

Vol. 1 is great on action, story and mystery.  High recommendation, also this is on one of my Listmania lists.

Watch for free on tv or better yet buy and blow threw this in a weekend.

-Hope this helps.",1332979200,3,1604,4.498257839721254
1421543,5,B00005BCJO,"For anyone who has or has not watched this series before, you should know (and I find this particularly wonderful) Big O's Roger Smith and the series in general is basically the Japanese Batman. Oh yeah, having heard this and not known it before you can watch the series enlightened.
Perhaps someone else has written that on here, whatever the case, there you go. This is one of my favorite Animes and a CLASSIC. They call it an Anime Legend for a reason.

I'll not write a plot summary, you can find a range of favorable to hateful versions elsewhere on Amazon.

I will warn anyone who buys this particular set (made in 2007) that it only contains the first season. There are other box sets from 2003 and 2004 which contain all of the episodes. The 2004 version is cheaper and therefore more accessible.

Ahhhh and now I'm just going to revel in the glory, THE GLORY!

Later though, I'm going to try comparing the 2004 and 2007 versions to see if one has a better quality than the other.

If anyone has done this already I would really appreciate the review, help out the needy and donate your knowledge.",1321142400,,1105,4.477611940298507
1421544,5,B00005BCJO,"The official Amazon review is a great critique... if, and only if, the show had left off at the end of the first season, as the author seems to believe. The second season took a few years to come out (the first season ended in 2000, the second premiered in 2003), which is very unfortunate, because it's the second season that really breaks the mold and makes The Big O one of the best animes ever written.
While the first season spent a lot of time with formulaic plots, and gave only dim insights into the events surrounding Paradigm City, the second season takes on a wholly different tone, with revelation after revelation leading to a climactic, and utterly boggling, finale.

This anime will not, and doesn't try to be, everyone's cup of tea. It is speculative, metaphysical, confusing, thought-provoking, and doesn't have the satisfying good-triumphs-over-evil type of ending. But even with all that, don't let the official review fool you, this is an anime that's not to be missed, even if it ends up being someone else's cup of tea.",1317686400,,1041,4.751381215469613
1421545,4,B00005BCJO,"Really, there's only one reason to watch this anime- an android girl who has become something of a cult idol figure among fanboys....R. Dorothy Wainwright. She is a fantasic character, extremely cool with a very dry sense of humour. Unfortunately, they didn't use her as much as they could have. The series really revolves around Roger Smith, a Negotiator who solves the problems in Paradigm City. Of course, when you have a dirty big mecha to call on when things get rough, ""negotiation"" with the bad guys becomes a lot easier!

I was a huge fan of the movie Dark City, and there's a definite similarity in the film-noir atmosphere and the obession with memory. Batman is also an obvious influence. In fact, it's possible to list a number of Batman/film noir cliches in the characterisation: the ultra-cool lead, the stoic butler, the femme fatale (Angel), the Joker-like psychotic baddie (Beck), and the shadowy criminal mastermind behind everything. And of course there's Dorothy. There's not exactly much subtlety or even depth to the characters, really, but they fill their roles well. The often funny interactions between Roger and Dorothy alone are worth watching.

However, the plot itself is a big let-down. The first series consists of mostly stand-alone episodes that hint at something deeper, but the series ends just as some of these important plot points are revealed. I was expecting the second series to continue from where the first left off, but it too wanders down side plots and stand-alone episodes, and again seems to end too abruptly. Apparently a further series was planned but never eventuated, leaving 'The Big O' with a rushed, unfinished feel. The plus side is the second series features more of Dorothy, and in a more active role.

Many individual episodes are interesting enough, but it's hard not to wish they formed a more coherent, finished, whole. As it is, the series has enormous potential that it never quite fulfills. However, the cool characters and their interaction do make up for this somewhat, and it is worth seeing if you like Batman, Dark City, or sci-fi/retro anime in general.",1251590400,2,2124,4.977464788732394
1421546,5,B00005BCJO,"BIG O was a unique show, with a good concept. Having everyone in the worlds memories erased and no one knows what happened, but everyone has clued inside of their minds. It reminds me a little of the movie DARK CITY. It had a nice twist on the Giant Robot anime, instead focusing on the characters and story. The story was great, you couldn't stop watching. All the twists and turns along the way in search of the what happened forty years ago. The story and characters were the best part of the show. The music was great, the animation was pretty good, and the action was good. The ending was great, but I still have no idea what really was going on. That's why I wish Cartoon Network had agreed to a season 3. I guess it just wasn't popular in both Japan and the USA.

Overall I think BIG O is under appreciated by most anime fans. Everyone should check out this series",1240704000,,871,4.278787878787878
1421547,5,B00005BCJO,"Imagine a crumbling domed Gotham City where everyone has amnesia, and Batman fights evildoers using a giant black mecha.

That's a fairly basic description of ""The Big O,"" a strange and action-packed anime with an art deco style, a noir atmosphere and lots of giant robots and strange conspiracies. This is no simplistic action show -- there's a deep central mystery that each episode revolves around, and some deeper meditations on the nature of memory.

Negotiator Roger Smith is hired to get the kidnapped daughter of a client back... only to discover that ""Dorothy"" is an android, who asks him to protect her. When he starts investigating, Roger learns of her ""sister"" -- vast mecha ""Dorothy 1"" -- who can only be stopped by his own mecha, the Megadeus called ""Big O."" But when Dorothy vanishes during the attack, Roger must find her before a gang of thieves do.

With the help of Dorothy and his faithful butler Norman (and occasionally hardened cop Dastun), Roger uses Big O to deal with a series of increasingly bizarre mysteries. Among his problems: a giant electric eel, a skeletal mecha controlled by the psycho ex-reporter ""Schwarzwald,"" a billionaire's missing son, a piano-playing android, a ""sea titan"" in a flooded city, a mysterious cat with horrifying origins, a Heaven's Day attack, and a mysterious woman haunting Dastun's dreams.

Things take a darker turn in the last few episodes, especially since Paradigm City's strange past becomes the most important part. Roger is hired to give a severance check to Schwarzwald, but becomes enmeshed in his plans for Paradigm City -- and witnesses the unveiling of another Megadeus, Big Duo.

And when a series of murders are committed by a red-cloaked figure -- who leaves Big O's motto ""Cast In The Name of God, Ye Not Guilty"" at each crime -- Roger starts to suspect that Dorothy may be involved. And even more confusing, Roger is suffering flashbacks of whatever happened forty years ago... which may be even more ghastly than anyone suspects.

""The Big O"" is one of those series that drips with lots of influences -- it hasa lovely classic noir feeling, more than a hint of ""Batman,"" and some tinges of Isaac Asimov (R. Dorothy?). And even the animation has a style reminiscent of art deco, with lots of long clean lines and dark shapes -- even the vast Megadeuses and other mecha have them.

But the real beauty of ""The Big O"" is in the storytelling: the individual plots are reminiscent of a noir detective's adventures, but with a weird sci-fi twist -- a mad journalist in a haunted subway, a mad geneticist, and giant robots that fly and swim. It's also graced with some explosive slam-bang action, intriguing hi-tech gadgets, and lots of wry humour (Dorothy sets off an elevator's weight alarm) and dialogue (""Did you say 'mama'? As in your mother?"").

And running under each episode is the haunting question of what happened to Paradigm forty years ago. The plots drop hints about floating memories and something terrible that turned Paradigm City into a series of half-ruined boroughs. This is especially true in the final episode, which briefly shows the horrifying past.

Dashing playboy Roger Smith is a pretty likable hero -- charismatic, charming, a bit lacking in chivalry at times, but ultimately quite heroic and kind. Dorothy's emotionless attitude makes a nice counterpoint, but she shows some signs of becoming more human (""Even I feel like playing the blues sometimes""). And for the true noir feel, there's a mysterious femme fatale named Angel who keeps getting Roger into trouble, and the likably efficient butler/cook/technician Norman.

While it appears to be just another mecha anime on the surface, ""The Big O"" is actually a clever sci-fi/noir series with underlying conspiracies and haunting mysteries.",1229385600,2,3793,4.977883096366509

And running under each episode is the haunting question of what happened to Paradigm forty years ago. The plots drop hints about floating memories and something terrible that turned Paradigm City into a series of half-ruined boroughs. This is especially true in the final episode, which briefly shows the horrifying past.

Dashing playboy Roger Smith is a pretty likable hero -- charismatic, charming, a bit lacking in chivalry at times, but ultimately quite heroic and kind. Dorothy's emotionless attitude makes a nice counterpoint, but she shows some signs of becoming more human (""Even I feel like playing the blues sometimes""). And for the true noir feel, there's a mysterious femme fatale named Angel who keeps getting Roger into trouble, and the likably efficient butler/cook/technician Norman.

While it appears to be just another mecha anime on the surface, ""The Big O"" is actually a clever sci-fi/noir series with underlying conspiracies and haunting mysteries.",1228608000,20,3793,4.977883096366509
1421549,5,B00005BCJO,"Imagine a crumbling domed Gotham City where everyone has amnesia, and Batman fights evildoers using a giant black mecha.

That's a fairly basic description of ""The Big O,"" a strange and action-packed anime with an art deco style, a noir atmosphere and lots of giant robots that attack on a weekly basis. The first volume quickly proves that this is no simplistic action show -- there's a deep central mystery that each episode revolves around, and some deeper meditations on the nature of memory.

Negotiator Roger Smith is hired to get the kidnapped daughter of a client back... only to discover that ""Dorothy"" is an android. So Roger begins poking around in the place where she was made, only to find her dying creator, some thugs with a bazooka, and a shocking revelation -- there were two robots, and now the vast mecha ""Dorothy 1"" is ravaging Paradigm City.

Cue earthshattering entrance of Big O, Roger's huge mecha, which kicks Dorothy 1's metal butt. But when Dorothy goes missing in the aftermath, Roger goes on a hunt for her based on her creator's dying words. He finds her at the Nightingale Club singing for a sad old man -- but then she's apprehended by the same gang of thugs.

Roger's next mission sends him out of town to a small village near a power plant: the inhabitants claim a lake god sends them electricity -- and soon Roger finds that they may not be exaggerating. Then the Paradigm Corporation hires a reluctant Roger to find the journalist Michael Seebach and get his writings. The problem is, Seebach has been missing for months -- and what is left of him has unearthed a ghastly specter from Paradigm's lost past.

""The Big O"" is one of those series that drips with lots of influences -- the first four episodes are painted with classic noir, more than a hint of ""Batman,"" and some tinges of Isaac Asimov (R. Dorothy?). And even the animation has a style reminiscent of art deco, with lots of long clean lines and dark shapes -- even the vast Megadeus has them.

The real beauty of ""The Big O"" is in the storytelling: the individual plots are reminiscent of a noir detective's adventures, but with a weird sci-fi twist -- vast electrical snakes, giant robots, and a mad journalist in a haunted subway with a nasty surprise from the past. It's also graced with some explosive slam-bang action, inner musings, and lots of solid dialogue infused with wry humour (""You're a louse, Roger Smith."" ""Well, that's a first. I'm used to human women saying that"").

And running under each episode is the haunting question of what happened to Paradigm forty years ago. The plots drop hints about floating memories and something terrible that may have happened, turning the world into a series of half-ruined domes.

Dashing playboy Roger Smith is a pretty likable hero -- charismatic, charming, a bit lacking in chivalry at times (""You want me to decoy their fire?"" ""BINGO!"") but ultimately quite heroic. Good thing, since he has the big bad robot. Dorothy's emotionless attitude makes a nice counterpoint, but she shows some signs of becoming more human (as all good fictional androids do). And for the true noir feel, there's a mysterious femme fatale named Angel and efficient butler Norman.

While it appears to be just another mecha anime on the surface, ""The Big O Volume 1"" is actually a clever sci-fi/mystery series with some big question marks hanging over it.",1228176000,,3385,4.762798634812286

The theme music as aired on Cartoon Network is great; the theme music on this particular DVD collection is totally different as it is a rather irritating rock tune that isn't very good (all episodes have this bad opening music). Finding the extas, for what they are worth, is difficult. When the opening menu comes up, you have to use the down arrow to see the extras and audio choices. The commentary by the writer, director and a couple cast members is a typed script you have to read and is spread across the four discs. The commentary is not very enlightening, especially when they reference particular episodes of other (much older, all the way back to ""Ultraman"") Japanese TV shows. If you don't know those shows, these references go right over your head. The trailers are for other anime programs, not this one. Apart from these ""gripes"" I've just stated, I love this DVD set. As long as you don't miss the theme music too much and have low expectations for the extras, you'll love this set too -- and you'll want the second season complete.

Just like the movie ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"", a lot of the writing is intentionally cheesey, which throws off a lot of critics who go in thinking they're going to get a bunch of typical Japanese anime BS where the characters go through bouts of nonsensical, mis-translated, faux-sophisticated speeches that only seem to make sense to people who have watched soooooo much anime that bland, repetitious concepts seem insightful and witty.",1195689600,3,602,5.02

I was attracted to the show by it's good elements: Great film noir feel, great music (while Roger was investigating), interesting characters, and a great concept: a city that has no clue what happened 40 years ago.

However, I could only watch 75% of the episodes until I finally decided to call it quits. Here's why:
-While the music is great while Roger is investigating, once the big fight scene happens, they consistently play the same weird music that sounds like it came from a marching band.
-There's no diversity between episodes; every episode follows the same format: Investigate something peculiar, find out a bad robot is involved, fight the bad robot. That's it.
-The writing isn't anything great. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the lines that were said.

I really wanted to like this anime, but I knew something was wrong when I was falling asleep during the episodes.

Act 1 Roger The Negotiator-The story begins a ex-cop turn Paradigm-City's top Negotiator Roger Smith (Voice by Steve Blum) takes a simple kidnapping case which goes wrong.  By saving R.

Though this is a beginning to the series the best part will come in every ep.

Act 3 Electric City which brings a new character into the Big-O play who will require the Negotiator to travel to foreign city outside of Paradigm-City to bring back the power for Paradigm only to encounter a shocking surprise.
Act 4 Underground Terror- One of the more suspenseful episodes of season 1 worth watching for its deep mystery plus revealing a new villain who goes by the name Schwarvald.
Act 5 Bring Back My Ghost- A wraith is killing few of Paradigm's top military police.  Plus a very rich mother hires Roger Smith to search for her lost son who died a year ago during a riot on what seems to be the George Washington Bridge.

Whats more to meet the eye is another scientist have something more in plan for Instro to fulfill his late father wish.
Act 7 The Call From The Past- Roger and Angel team up in this ep to uncover hidden mystery of memories lying in the sea that lies south of Paradigm-City.  What they encounter is more they can handle.
Act 8- Missing Cat- One of the few ep we see Dorothy Wayneright having human emotions which can be clearly seen in this heart felt ep of a lost kitten which Dorothy finds which turns out to be a actual human boy turn cat.  A evil scientist plan of requiring money from Paradigm officials which Roger will denied any negotiation on this job.
Act 9- Beck Comes Back- Beck returns in this one after being freed from prison with the help of his goons with a new yellow megaduce.  Once again  Roger is called in for a kidnapping case which a rich man who son is kidnap for ransom.

Act 11 Heaven's Day- This is a Christmas ep of Big-O which some will look weird about a giant megaduce taking on a giant Christmas tree. A enstrange d scientist threatens to destroy the city with a little surprise.
Act 12- Enemy Is Another Big!- The title says it all Roger Smith and the Big-O meets a return villain along with a BIG surprise.  One of the best eps of season 1.
Act 13- R.D.- After winning the battle against another BIG Roger Smith is on a case of a killer who is killing those who have memories of 40 year's ago.  Roger will discover the mystery's of what happen 40 year's ago only to discover he is next on the list of being killed.

I fell in love. It's a charming show of negotiator Roger Smith and his Megaduse, The Big O, a mecha type thing. It has a feel of mystery to it since, in a way, Roger Smith is like a P.I.

Video - It fits to the mood perfectly... depressing but still graphically amazing. The graphics of Big O have a depressed undertone but also have underlayings of the action-adventure-mystery-romance it is.

Audio - The dub is better than the sub? Crazy but true. This is one anime where the dub is high quality. Voice actors and lip movements all round are good.

Subtitles - Tgey hit the mark, meaning they are excellent, but don't worry about it. Dubbing is great for once, perhaps because it is loved by American audiences more so than Japan.

Story - It has more or less everything. Let me put it this way. If you liked Neon Genesis (who doesn't?) then who will almost certainly like this. Especially later on.

1421576,5,B00005BCJO,"I was hooked from the very moment I watched those words run across the screen. Big-O has been one of my favorite anime's since it was on TV before Adult swim was even conceived [See;Toonami]. Roger Smith (a sort of mix between Batman and James Bond without the sexuality, although women call him a louse) is a negotiator of Paradigm City.

A place that lost all memory of its past existence Forty years ago, where the rich close themselves up in domes and the poor live without protection. And on one faithful day he manages to stumble across a mystery concerning an android girl named Dorothy Wainwright. From there the suave Roger Smith finds himself trying to uncover the past of Paradigm City while trying to protect it from giant androids and creatures of horrid design.

The show has its own sense of stylish flare and a storyline that is original in so many ways its hard not to love it. The DVD contains trailers, subtitles, and language selection. The English Dub (much like Outlaw Star and ROD:THE TV) really suits the Anime more so than original Japanese Dub does, the VO's for Roger, Norman, and Dorothy among others suit their characters like a quality glove. With a mix of action, drama, and a greatstoryline, this is one Anime no one should pass up. [a 5 out of 5]",1116288000,,1279,4.580786026200873
1421577,5,B00005BCJO,"From the creator of Giant Robo comes the ultimate in retro cool. This series is one of the great ones, one of the classics. It has a main character who's filthy rich, dressed to kill, has the gadgets of James Bond, the crime-fighting abilites of batman, negotiates with villains just to have some fun and...pilots a giant robot!

Like Giant Robo, the Big O itself is a throwback to old-school anime. Less high-tech and more steam-punk, the thing is clearly a mechanical iron hulking beast, rather than a fast-moving flying transformer. OLD SCHOOL. But there's more than just a tribute to old anime to be found here. The sense of style is very retro 1930's adn 40's. From the cars to the clothes to the buildings, everything has a retro look. And the characters themselves are drawn with a simple elegance than blends perfectly with that style.

The animation itself is more like a direct-to-video release than a TV show, and clearly had a very high budget. There is an incredible film-noir feel to everything thanks to the subdued color palette and stellar animation, which makes use of camera angles better than many a hollywood Oscar winner.

The brilliant musical score recalls everything from the Avengers to Batman to blues, jazz, and classical music (including opera). The sound of this show is not just there, it is engineered for effect, and the music always adds to the scene.

Of course it's really the story and the characters (to say nothing of the plot) which holds a good anime together, and this show does NOT disappoint. Roger Smith himself is more than just a sterotyped hero. As with all the other characters in this show, there is far more to him than what appears on the surface. His counterpart Dorothy (introduced in the first two episodes), is a perfect match for him, as her dour expression and pessimism counter his persistent cheerfulness and good nature. That and the fact that she can fight with, investigate with, and generally KEEP UP with him. Really Dorothy has to be one of the most interesting Androids ever conceived, as we constantly get hints that there is more going on in her head than what appears on the surface. There are of course many other wonderful characters introduced in this show, but two main ones take the cake in the first three episodes. Beck is a wonderfully pathetic excuse for a criminal masermind who comes to see himself as Roger's nemesis, but really just annoys everyone more than anything else (because defeating him isn't really a challenge for Roger and Dorothy), and Angel, who's mysterious agenda, deadly beautiful, and wonderful verbal sparring give Dorothy a run for her money in the department of love-interest.

The plot of the city with no memories in search of its past is very compelling, and the reference to memories beign uncovered and lost technology lends everything a somewhat magical, fightening undercurrent that makes the mysteries that much more compelling. As the plot slowly unfolds, we become more and more engrossed in the reality of Paradigm City, the city of amnesia.

The quality of writing and dialog in this fantasic anime really cannot be over-emphasized. I would have to call it an absolute tour-de-force of adventure, romance, and drama. Watch the whole series over and over, and you just might notice new aspects of the story and characters each time.

This volume contains the first four episodes. The first two epsidoes are about the criminal Beck and his hostage/blackmailing schemes involing the adriod R. Dorothy Waynewright and her makers/fathers. While good, they mainly serve to introude Beck and Dorothy, and are done in a different style from the rest of the series (no intro, and credits during hte beginning). The third episode begins the real meat of the series, and introduces Angel through a mysterious job for Roger to investigate a power plant for the Paradigm Power Management. That third episode features the main show intro, and shows if nothing else that the theme of monster/machine battles with the Big O are going to stay.

The fourth episode is the kicker though. Underground Terror establishes perhaps the real villain of the show, the scariest person Roger has to fight (a man covered with bandages like a mummy who has a nasty habit of burning things and raining down destruction upon innocents). It is in this episode that we finally get a little more insight into the past of Paradigm City, the loss of its memories, and just who and what exactly Roger and Dorothy are. Not that any questions are really answered, more are just raised. This episode might be my favorite of this volume because of the interaction between Dorothy and Roger.

This is an absolutely brilliant show. The amount of polish on every aspect is clear to see, and it features one of the finest English dubs you'll ever hear. David Lucas (Spike from Cowboy Bebop), and Lia Sargent (Battle Athletes Victory) give career-defining voicework in the main roles, and the voices of Beck and Angel in particular are also wonderful.

Anyone who's a fan of classic anime, giant robots, superheroes, or sci-fi will want to give this one a try. The only downside I can see is that at times the battles seem to overshadow or distract from the story, but that's a minor complaint at best in a show that deserves every animation fan's respect and admiration.

1421599,5,B00005BCJO,"Ahh, the Big O. Truly a masterpiece.

The Big O features an art deco-inspired art style, simplistic-yet-stylized character design, and a soothing musical score revolving around sweet jazz.

The most common description I've heard of the Big O is to throw Batman into the Godzilla movies, replace the spandex with a giant robot, and throw in some James Bond flair for good measure. While these raw ingredients sound like a recipe for disaster, Big O takes something frail and turns it into something strong as diamond: the human soul.

All the citizens of Paradigm City lost their memories in the ""Event,"" which occured 40 years prior to the audience's introduction. Roger Smith, a wealthy businessman, acts as a negotiator in extreme incidents. But when things get too rough he calls on his ""megadues,"" the Big O, for help. The massive machination towers over the city as guardian. While the local police aren't too friendly towards it, Roger and Big O get their job done with enough gratitude from the citizens.

Roger, assisted by his butler Norman and an android girl named R. Dorothy, takes on the task of either recovering or destroying the city's lost memory. Tormented by his own desire to uncover his history and the knowledge that it no longer matters, Roger faces enemies of his long-lost past and threats of Biblical proportions.

The robots aren't what most would imagine, either. Instead of being super-machines from a science-fiction movie, Big O and its enemies feature coarse design for realism and dramatic effect. The stovepipe limbs and clumsy mechanics make them more believable. Even Big O's trademark attack fits the theme. Rather than have a laser cannon pop out of its chest, the robot's arms use built-in tanks of compressed air to deliver powerful punches. Watching the steam rise from the smoking fist never gets boring.

The overall visuals of the show are astounding, and the dialogue is almost Shakespearean - just without all the confusing, flowery, words. The intriguing plot will draw you in, so even you want to know what Paradigm City's past was like. But the story is built on the individual characters and their relationships with one another; which gives the larger events all the more Umph!

The Big O's spectacular artwork, beautiful music, original characters, and deep storyline make it really shine. Grab your popcorn and have a seat... ""it's Showtime.""",1110412800,3,2395,5.017632241813602
1421600,5,B00005BCJO,"so, I'm not a huge anime fan, but there are a few here and there that entertain me (ghost in the shell, and witch hunter robin mostly), but when I stumbled across this series, I knew I had found something special. Although it is not without its flaws (the middle episodes can get down-right boring), there is something very stylish and unique about this movie. I won't attempt to explain the some-what complicated story, as you can read about it above, but all I can tell you is that if you are an anime fan, you should check it out. Although it doesn't present a lot of philosiphy (like Ghost in the Shell), it isn't quite as mindless (no offence) as Witch Hunter Robin. One word of warning, the story is not wrapped up in a nice little bow at the end, and never will, because the second season was never produced and scraped... which is the series only down fall, because after watching the ""first"" and only season, you will want to know more about exactly what happend 40 years ago in the tattered city that is the backdrop for the story. Sure, some of the diologe is a little cheesy (you have to understand that the films were prodeced in a different culture, and some things always get lost in english translation), and some characters could use some more development, but this is forgivable, because the series is about the story, and not nearly as much about the people who tell it. You should at the very least look into it. You might just find yourself a fan.",1103328000,2,1468,4.440740740740741
1421601,5,B00005BCJO,"If I had a dollar for every episode of Big O I loved, i'd have many a dollar. It is the best show in the world. I hate anime, except for this and witch hunter robin. Anime sucks, but this one has a deeper meaning, it takes a very deep concept and visualises it, plus, they made batman and batman rocks!",1101254400,2,302,3.9672131147540983
1421602,5,B00005BCJO,"Like everyone else who has posted, I first heard of Big O from watching Toonami and Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.  When I first saw the first episode, I will admit I didn't think much of the show.  Yet, as the episode went on I found the show quote interesting.  The more episodes I watched the more interesting the story line became.

I eventually saw the entire first season, and had to have the DVD collection.  The aspects that make this show interesting have already been discussed: music, dubbing, story line, etc.  Yet, what makes this a worth-wile buy is the fact that you can watch it many times, and never really have the show figured out.  Because even with the last episode there is not really any complete closure to be found, it is a show that keeps you wondering?

I also had to have the sound track because the varioius styles of music on the show from opera, to jazz, to a kind of techno sound were enthralling.  This series also touches on the human element of, ""Who am I really, and why am I here?""  The fact that the main characters are all vulnerable, and are not all so tuff, but real people is interesting.  (some of this comes out in the second season.......but that is for another review.)

Of course don't forget it is always cool to see robots fighting in a big city, but I can't imagine what insurance costs in Paradigm City.....sheesh every other day or week some robot is causing trouble.

So if you like the mystery, suspense, and giant robots fighting in densely populated areas, this DVD is for you.  It's showtime!",1101168000,,1549,4.485714285714286
1421603,5,B00005BCJO,"Big O that came out in 1999 by Sunrise and Bandai Entertainment who brought Gundam Wing, Macross and Gundam games is one of the greatest cartoons I've seen in the year 2000.

 This is a great series, one of the newest Japan Anime in 2001 and surely one of the best cartoons out there.

 American animators cannot emulate the Japan Anime cartoons and Big O is proof.

 It's gritty, romantic, touching, action packed and full of stories, and that is in every episode!!

 The star is Roger Smith who is the head negotiator in breaking or sealing criminal cases or any cases where the police or military is afraid to get involved in.

 He lives in Paradigm city, a dark city that has been torn by crime, military action and corruption.

 In only his first days on the job, he catches the idea of an attractive and elegant young lady called ""Dorothy"".

 Dorothy is not you're average woman, she is a whiz on the piano and has a certain way with people. Oh yeah Dorothy is a robot.

 She is virtually indestructible,yet her softness in characters reveals she is not made entirely of metal.

 Dorothy is cared for by her Grandfather. The Grandfather knows Dorothy is a robot but he protects her like his own daughter.

 A hoodlum by the name of Beck Gold plots to steal Dorothy and Smith (having suspicions about Dorothy) tries to intervene. Dorothy's Grandfather is shot and Beck kidnaps Dorothy .

 Smith rescues her eventually and they develop a mutual friendship between man and machine.

 The series works because of it's likeable characters, musical soundtrack which uses the piano to produce a feeling of what's going on in a scene,and above all incredible animation. The musical scences with the piano also convey a soothing feeling to a long day.

 Smith controls an undercover machine knows as ""Megadeus"" which is Big O.

 The series reminds me of Voltron because Megadeus fights many bosses in every episode in spectacular fashion.

 The series has been dubbed in English and currently showing in Cartoon Network's lineup.

 The dubbing is amazingly good. It's one of the best dubbing jobs, I've seen so far. David Lucas (Roger Smith), Lia Sargent(Dorothy) lend their great voices to this anime.

 Made through Bandai and Sunrise which produced Gundam Wing and Macross, these guys just keep making the hits.

 Initially 13 episodes were made leading to a cliffhanger where

 the Big O meets other Giant Robots that guarded oldtime paradigm

 city.

 Well last year 13 new episodes including the final was realesed

 totalling 26 eps on Cartoon Network. Several storylines like the

 return of Roger Smith's enemy Beck Gold. There are also

 some interesting twists as political bureacrats are also trying

 take down the Big O, in fear of lost memories being uncovered.

 The DVD for the collector's series features cool cover artwork

 and rare interviews with the Japanese cast of the Big O.

 Take it from this great critic, Big O is a big success.",1090972800,3,2955,4.788423153692615
1421604,3,B00005BCJO,"""The Big O"" is a disappointingly mediocre series. Disappointing, because it had the potential to be something really cool. However, it falls short of the mark.

 The show looks great, and the art-deco feel adapted from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" is really spectacular. The character designs are all enticing, and the premise is interesting as well. A world that underwent complete amnesia 40 years ago, and now the citizens live and work in an environment they don't completely understand. The lead characters, negotiator Roger Smith and the girl-android Dorothy, are cool characters, investigating Dorothy's past along side other mysteries. The whole thing has a really nice film noir feel to it.

 But...then a non-sequitor Giant Robot appears, for a climatic Giant Robot battle every episode. It breaks the detective-style flow of the series, breaks the tone, and is just plain silly. Imagine watching ""The Maltese Falcon,"" only to have the story end with Humphrey Bogart climbing into a previously unmentioned Giant Robot.

 The combination of genres just doesn't work. Too bad really, as there are enough Giant Robot animations in the world. An art deco film noir animation would have been really something.",1090281600,2,1215,5.269430051813472
1421605,5,B00005BCJO,"That quote from the previews on Cartoon Network pretty much sums it up, but really there's much more to it than that. Whereas other cartoon shows and anime have explored the whole futuristic film-noir thing before, The Big O is absolutely DRENCHED in film-noir atmosphere. And the similarities to Batman are quite understandable, as this show is brought to you by some of the same people who created Batman Beyond. Unfortunately, some of the weaknesses of that show carry over as well. Some episodes have a tendancy to just be an excuse for Rodger to fight yet ANOTHER enemy with his giant robot (much as some episodes of Batman Beyond were just another excuse for Batman to fight yet ANOTHER monster). In my opinion, the best episodes are the ones that focus more on the characters and their development, with less emphasis on fights.

One episode is worthy of mention, as I feel that it is the single greatest epsisode of any show I have ever seen. In the episode ""Winter Night Phantom"", one of the side-characters of the show finds that a spree of mad bombings he is investigating has some strange link to a reoccurring dream he has (one which shows the final scene from a movie where the two characters remind him of himself, and someone else that he keeps catching brief glimpses of) , and as he comes closer to fiding the person responsible, he finds that his memories may indeed be predicting (or causing) his own future. That episode can be taken completely on it's own (almost like a short film) and carries out it's concept so flawlessly that it leaves me awestruck every time I see it. Truly one of the great moments of anime history.

Most people who watch this show for more than a few minutes cannot help but be taken in by it. The reasons why should be obvious. There is the aforementioned film-noir atmosphere, gorgeous artwork, and some VERY snappy dialogue. More than that, the English voice actors really pour their heart and soul into this one (with the voice actors who portray Roger Smith and Dorothy being truly sublime). The music suits the atmosphere and mood perfectly, and really gets you into the drama. Sadly though, the music is reused over and over (and Roger's introductory comments at the beginning of each episode are quite similar as well). Some people might think of this as a weakness, but personally I like the way that each and every episode is self-contained and self-explanatory, while still building on previous episode subtly.

The action sequences in this show don't disappoint, and are all done with a slick sense of style. There is some comedy in this show, but it's often subtle, building on the characters and their behaviors.

The plot to this show is frustrating to some and deeply involving to others. Those going into the show expecting to get answers to all their questions are in for disappointment, while those who like a show that raises more questions as it goes along will probably get into this one.

At the end of the day, this show is about a few things more than anything else. It's about great characters, a cool story, and style, style, style. Heck, after I got into this show, I bought a black suit just so I'd look more like Rodger. If you love classic anime, give this one a try. ""It's show time!""",1089849600,7,3264,4.649913344887349
1421606,5,B00005BCJO,"I absolutely LOVE this anime! There is something intriguing about the story line that makes it impossible not to watch. Roger Smith is a (very fine) negotiator that searches for answers to Paradigm City's loss of memories from 40 years prior. 'Big O' contains some awesome battle scenes with huge Medadeus robots. But with all of this action, I am always in suspense in each episode to see if Dorothy (a pretty android Roger has chose to look after) and Roger will ever let their feelings for one another show. I HIGHLY recommend 'Big O' for anyone who loves action and suspense with a good plot.",1083196800,,596,4.632075471698113

This is an anime that will make you think and the action will have you on the edge of your seat.

1421608,4,B00005BCJO,Well I started watching Big O on Toonami from day 1 and I really loved the whole design except for the fact that Dorothy was an android. I mean it essential to the story but just like almost every other android meets human story the human and the android always fall in love but even if they get together there is still the fact that most of the time the human will grow old and die while the android will stay young and live forever(mind you there are others with different types of androids that may age)and that is kind of depressingly complicated. Also the ending reminded me of Furi Kuri(whick is one of my favs)cause it was so complicated that you hardly wanted that to be the end.

Big O is anime aimed primarily at adults (much like the batman series)  It does have a plot, a rather complex one, in fact, spanning multiple episodes.
There is a second season, co-produced by cartoon network, (by the same studio that did the animated batman, actually.)  And there are plans for a third season.  Fret not, Charles, the plot will be resolved.",1071014400,9,406,4.771428571428571

At times it can be so complex that its confusing and begs to be watched again to understand it.(thats not a bad thing) As the members of the Adult Swim show blok on Cartoon Network will attest to on their message board. But Charles says ""the stories lack plot depth and characterization"" but then later says the plot is complex. He nneds to take a side and stick with it. The reason that most of the characters are not imediatly understandable is because You see more of them as the show goes on and additional information is revealed. In a city shrouded in mystery, it only makes sense for the characters to have the same qualitites and not just be readily apparent. It is a show that is worth watching and now that season 2 is out, more is explained and the show is pretty much resolved.",1068163200,23,890,4.303571428571429

If it turns out to be as popular as the first season, then a third will be jointly produced as well.  So we'll be getting our answers about the story.",1064793600,9,318,4.096774193548387
1421623,5,B00005BCJO,"When The Big O first premiered on Cartoon Network's Toonami, I dismissed it as being ""just another mecha show"".  It wasn't until it aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim that I actually sat down and watched the entire series, realizing how great the series truly is.
At first glance, Big O seems like just another giant robot show.  However, if you dismiss it, like I did, you will be missing out on one of the greatest animes I have seen in a long time.  In fact, it is very different from many mecha series in that each episode plays out as a sort of mystery, making it popular to compare this series to the animated Batman series.
The story of the series is very dark, telling of Paradigm City, a metropolis much like a run-down New York, where every inhabitant lost their memories 40 years prior to the events of the series.  ""Memories"" have become precious commodities in the ""city of amnesia"".  Fragments of these memories are the Megadeus's, giant robots that seem to have minds of their own.  Roger Smith, the show's protagonist, pilots one such Megadeus, the powerful Big O.
The story may be dark, but the characters are certainly colorful.  Roger Smith is a negotiator (think private investigator) who pilots the Big O.  R. Dorothy is a female android who becomes Roger's sidekick and maid.  Beck is a small-time criminal who seeks vengeance for Roger humiliating him.  Many more characters appear and play important roles in the series.
The animation, voice acting, and musical score are supurb.  The animation is very fluid, but the colors are often drab but help to convey the mood of the series.  The voice actors all do an excellent job, and they may be familiar to the avid anime viewer.  The music is epic and helps to draw you into the show.  The opening theme is somewhat strange, but I grew to like it over time.
All in all, Big O is one of my favorite series ever.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys giant robot anime or just anime in general.",1063670400,51,1981,4.588068181818182
1421624,5,B00005BCJO,"This series is a departure from the normal anime that is out there.  It is much more realistic (in many ways) for one thing.  Some of the technology is science fiction, but overal everything has a retro feel to it.  The characters are more realistic.  Even the fictional technology is not so far out that it draws attention to itself.  It shows people actually living.  They eat, sleep, work, socialize, and more.  The entire series is mostly dark, which fits the overal plot.  The plots are simple, but the story does progress well.  It is nice to have a series where there is not a single theme that occupies every thought and action.  It is not done in soap opera fashion either.  There is an overal plot, and some episodes do reflect on actions and events from previous ones.  However, each episode does not lead directly to the next. Many episodes could stand alone.
The entire series takes place in and around a single city.  In fact, other than vauge references to other locations it is almost as if Paradigm City and the surrounding area are isolated from the rest of the world.
Roger is a very human character.  He is almost rude one moment and caring in the next.  A very stubborn man with a strict code of ethics.  He is not superior or special.  He makes mistakes, and even appologizes.
The second season is currently (September 2003) airing on Cartoon Network.  I was so overjoyed to find this out.  Many of us were so heartbroken when it just ended at a climactic moment.
This is a very good series for anyone to watch.  There is no nudity, excessive profanity, or excessive violence.  This is a great series that relies on good content to tell a great story, and the price for the whole season is cheap.  I can't wait to get season 2 when it comes out on DVD.  It is rare that I buy a series after seeing it on TV.  This one is worth it.  It is a series that even someone that is not an anime fan can enjoy.",1063411200,5,1922,4.361581920903955
1421625,5,B00005BCJO,"This is, without a doubt one of the greatest anime's of all time. This show has style and drama, that really has not been seen since Cowboy Bebop. The best thing about the show is that the story keps you guessing and wondering what the heck is really going on. Just when you think its gonna end one way, the whole story changes, and continues in a completely new path. The music had got to be the best part of the show. It sets the mood and atmosphere of each scene in the series, whether it be total action, or the sad death of a main character.
  The story is this (at least how the story is right now). A negotiator, Roger Smith, provides a much needed service in the city of Paradigm, the city of amnesia. Apparently, something, still unknown, hit this city and the entire world 40 years ago, and caused everyone to lose their memories, and all ideas of who they really were. Through a complex story line, Roger basically tries to find out what really happened. The show ended on a cliff hanger and is now into its second season after waiting a year and a half. And let me tell you, the first season was just the beginning. All bets are off, and everything you were told in season one, might be a lie. Basically, buy this, watch the second season on cartoon network, and freakin enjoy every mintue of it. Then buy the second season when that comes out.

1421626,5,B00005BCJO,"Just adding my two cents to the great reviews already here!
I saw this series when it was broadcast on Cartoon Network a few years ago, and I was hooked on it from the first episode! I'm not usually a fan of big robots that duke it out in the streets, but the characters and the visual style of this anime really drew me in. I'm a big fan of Art Deco (same reason I liked Batman: The Animated Series, which shares some of the same production staff), and this series is loaded with it, from the buildings, to the vehicles, to the film noir feeling that pervades the entire series.
Roger Smith is probably one of the smoothest cats in anime, yet even he gets blindsided every now and then by questions from his unflappable robot maid/ward/royal pain in the keister, R. Dorothy Wayneright.
Case in point: Roger and Dorothy are investigating the kidnapping of the son of a prominent Paradigm industrialist (in the episode, ""Beck Comes Back""). Discussing the son's parents, who met after losing their memories in the Event, Dorothy says she has two questions for Roger. The first one is, ""Does losing your memory really make you that lonely?"" Roger says it's a tough question to answer, but makes a go of it, then asks Dorothy what the 2nd question is. ""Forget it,"" she says. ""If you thought the last one was tough, this one is worse."" Dorothy is damaged in the battle to retrieve the industrialist's son, and Roger asks Norman, his capable butler, to take care in repairing her so she can ask the question...and what is the question? ""If you and I lost our memories, and we met, would we fall in love?"" That one renders Roger speechless...
There are many such moments, as well as ones that speak a little too close to home, such as the dangers of genetic manipulation, nuclear holocaust, and evil that disguises itself as benevolence.
Luckily there is a second set of 13 episodes to help answer some of the questions raised by the first season! The voice acting is well done (you'll hear familiar voices if you're a fan of Cowboy Bebop) and the music is very cool. Enjoy!",1062633600,3,2067,4.544235924932976
1421627,4,B00005BCJO,"If you were at all familiar with Cartoon Network's Toonami block or its late night Adult Swim in the past few years, it's likely that you have at least heard of The Big O. This Japanese anime series flopped in Japan but was quite well recieved stateside. So after its first 13 episode edited run on Toonami a few years back, fans were left hungry for more, and the cliffhanger ending didn't help either. Enter Cartoon Network Japan. U.S. fan response was so great that the cable network entered into a co-production deal with Sunrise Inc and Bandai visual. So now Big O has returned for a second uncut run on Adult Swim, in addition, the new season is airing Sundays at 11 pm starting August 3rd.
This DVD set is a compilatiion of all 13 first-season episodes, which was brought fourth due the show's new beginning. Big O tells the story of Roger Smith, also known as ""The Negotiator."" He lives in a large mansion accompanied by his butler Norman, who aids not only in housekeeping, but also in keeping Roger prepared for action. He resides in the mysterious Paradigm City, a city where all of its citizens lost their memories 40 years ago. In addition to being Paradigm's best negotiator, he is the owner of the Big O, a gigantic robot, which he uses the protect the city from various threats. However, through his adventures, Roger is digging ever deeper into Paradigm's dark history.
The Big O is a stylish show which mixes noir style and mecha action, with a Batman-like hero all while presenting a mystery into human existance that resembles the Matrix in some ways. The Big O has a visual style that is more American in nature, but is well animated. The voice acting is excellent, coming from the people who dubbed Cowboy Bebop. The music is good, accompanying the noir slyle and action scenes well. The mech fight scenes are not particularly amazing, but they still manage to excite you and hold interest well.

From the ""Big O"" theme to the soleful sax music used for incidental and panoramic scenes. Great dialoge and voice actors to boot. The scenes with Roger and Dorthy are some of the great ones. Dorthy is constantly exploring what is to be human, all the while pointing out Roger's shortcomings. Many in comic deadpan that will leave you laughing. Their relationship growing through the series.

1421650,4,B00005BCJO,"The genre: Big robots, light noir, pays homage to movies like ""Blade Runner"", ""James Bond"", ""Mike Hammer"" and the comic book ""Batman."" Though ""The Big O"" has an original premise they primarily entertain us with with strung together cliches from the aforementioned genres. Though this sounds trite, nonetheless, it works very well and is entertaining.
About the premise: The story takes place in a town called 'Paradigm City'. A city whereas 40 years before the population had suffered a mass amnesia from an unknown orgin. Subsequently the citizens at large, surrounded by advanced technology, have had to cope with how to use it and and how make it work. Thus, we have the morphing of low-tech and high-tech gadgets which, when combined, have an art deco look and feel such as the telephones, the typewriters, and of course the giant sized robots known as the Mega Deus'. By the way, our protagonist happens to own one
The Protagonist is a man I assume to be in his late 20's early 30's who makes his living as a professional negoitiator. He is brought to life by the voice talents of, David Lucas, also known for his voice work for the character, 'Spike Spiegal' in the anime series, ""Cowboy BeBop"". The character is a cross between Batman and James Bond with all applicable gizmos at his disposal.
A second protagonist named, Dorothy, is a android portrayed by the voice talents of, Liz Sargent, also known for her voice work on ""Serial Experiments: Lain"" and ""Trigun"". Dorothy's character, im my humble opinion, comes straight out of the movie ""Blade Runner"". (Remember the replicant known as 'Priss'?) With that in mind, Dorothy is more intelligent than Priss but she is less emotionally developed.
The giant robots here are very heavy looking, pile driving, and possibly artifically intelligent. (Hmm, shades of ""Evangelion""?) The battles take place in a generally abandoned part of the city with lots of former high rises being decimated.
About the cliches: We have a noir saxophone playing blues rounding out the soundtrack, the grumpy police captain, the wise guy informant at the bar who spills nicely when paid, the giant robot who appears conviently when the proper phrase is uttered, some ... women here and there, and a self centered hero who is a moralist.
Caveat: The artistic style here is very Americanized. Not like your general anime style. It has the look and feel of ""Batman The Animated Series"".
Pros: Great voice talents, elegant art direction, a good soundtrack, original premise, cliches that are amusing to see in this context.
Cons: The titling in the begining disappoints! It fails to capture any essence as to what the show is about and appears to be hacked together quickly with ... video effects and lettering. The opening song is, in my opinion, a straight [copy] from a ""Queen"" tune which that was the opening theme song to the Universal Studio film, ""Flash Gordon"".
Overall, its light, fun, and I am glad I own it.

I have not seen the entire series yet, but I have seen enough to know that it's worth the time and money.  If you're an anime fan, or a Batman (the animated series) fan, you will enjoy this for sure, and those that aren't fans of either one of those, I think will STILL enjoy this.",1011744000,,353,3.9577464788732395
1421652,5,B00005BCJO,"While I wasn't a fan of this show when it first aired on CN, I became a fan mid way through the first run of the show. Then after that I wanted to watch all of the 13 epsiodes of this show.
The one thing that caught me with this show was the totally different style of drawing that this series has. Not the realist style drawing or the comic style that you see on other Anime series.(I.E. Dragonball Z) This series is take a gotic styling setting that totally set is apart from other series. The gotic style isn't in the buildings or the Mecha, but also in the people. Which is something that I haven't see before.",1010188800,,614,4.168067226890757
1421653,5,B00005BCJO,"I enjoyed this alot. It was a little hard to follow, but what anime isn't? It has a very Batman type feel. He is a playboy and seems to be rich. He has a side kick who happens to be an android and he also has a butler who knows his secret. Neat technology stuff with a nice dose of mecha in it to make an anime fan happy. The DVD really isn't that great in the sense of the extras you get. If you like the batman stuff and you like anime this is a must have.",1007337600,,458,3.683673469387755
1421654,4,B00005BCJO,"I first saw all THE BIG O episodes on Cartoon Network, and kind of fell for it in spite of some of it's over the top cheesey-ness. Yes, it's a complete rip of Batman (rich bachelor lives with butler, drives special car, and has a huge cave under his home) with a Mech (instead of a bat-costume), the oftentimes sappy saxophone is totally out of COWBOY BEBOP, the animation is stylized but limited, the character names are out of control, and they constantly repeat the ""40 years ago everyone lost their memories"" theme without ever really getting into ""why,"" but there's still enough of a hook to keep me coming back.
The DVD version is longer than those episodes shown on Cartoon Network, and hence, unedited. Seeing the differences between the TV and DVD versions is interesting. The first time I saw the true version of  ""Cast in the name of good,"" I was surprised.
I just wish there were more than the 13 episodes! It seemes the creators are finally scratching the surface in addressing the 3 major story plots (what happened 40 years ago, where did the Mega's come from, is Roger in love with Dorothy) just as we reach the end of the first season.
It's an incomplete story that needs to be cut some slack for whenever it goes out on a limb, and it's worth every decadent bit. I can't help but laugh whenever the lead character says his ""Roger Smith"" name out loud to himself, but this silliness adds to the appeal, if you let it.
COWBOY BEBOP is a better and more well-rounded series, but THE BIG O is a nice second. If anyone who matters is reading this, I'd love to see a second season...
I WANT MORE BIG O!",1004054400,,1614,4.416107382550336
1421655,5,B00005BCJO,"Paradigm City, is the city of amnesia, where the rich inclose them selves in domes and the poor are left out in the gutters.  All the inhabitants of 40 years ago lost any and all memories one day, but where there's a will there's a way, some how the human race is able to move on with no memories what so ever.
Roger Smith, the negotiater, knows this all to well, after all the majority of his work centers around lost memories.  This series is Batman meets 007 meets big robot.  Big O is a MegaDues with an awesome weapon as his arms, what is it?  Well you'll have to watch to find out!  The first episode Roger Smith is hired to get a man's daughter, Dorthy, back. but Roger failed the mission because the person, or thing, he gets back is an android.  But little does Roger know, Dorthy will become part of his life.  Roger also has a Butler type guy, kind of like
Alfred in Batman, named Norman.  The two are almost identicle (Alfred and him that is).
I find the sound track of the series is extreamly relaxing, even though i usually don't like the kind of music. The animation is great!
Awesome, awesome flick get it! You won't be dissapointed.  Big O... It's showtime!!!!!",999129600,,1178,4.342465753424658

1421657,3,B00005BCJO,"Big O probably has the most original style of any series I've watched.  It combines Batman-esque designs with giant robots and blues music; you'll never see anything quite like it.  There is guarenteed to be action in every episode, and the main characters are very well defined.  Roger is used to living alone doing things his own way, but must adapt to living with the unique robot Dorothy.  The world of Big O is full of mystery as the world has lost all memory of civilization prior an event which wiped out most of the world.  Roger's main goal is to find these memories, through various means and people and solve the mystery of what caused the cataclysm.  This great story unforunately may never come to a conclusion as the show was cancelled after only one season.  Watching these episodes may be interesting, but will only break your heart since you'll never know the fate of Roger and Dorothy.  On a technical note, the DVD only contains 4 episodes and the bare minimum of extras so purchasing is not highly recommended.  You're better off catching some reruns on Cartoon Network if they ever bring the series back.",995760000,,1125,4.67005076142132
1421678,5,B00005BCJO,"I was a little wary of this series when I first caught it on Cartoon Network. It didn't look or sound like any anime I'd ever seen, what with the Bruce Timm style art and the 50's blues noir soundtrack. But these little differences really grew on me, and it didn't hurt that the dub actors were on a talent level with the ""Gundam Wing"" cast.
I'd have bought the DVD just for that alone, not to mention the chance to watch the show in its original, beloved Japanese. No matter how good a dub is, the original is always at least a little better. Plus, the show's opening credits (something ommited from every show on CN's Toonami block) was hilarious, done in a psychadelic James Bond style with a theme song almost totally ripped off of Queen's ""Flash Gordon"" theme. Also, the interview with the show's creators was a nice touch as well.
One complaint...only four episodes on the DVD? The Chinese release came with 6 on one and 7 on the other. Ah well, so we poor North American shmucks have to buy three volumes instead of two. We're used to it. Unless they switch the format to three episodes per disc for the next one...*shudder*.",995068800,,1132,4.447115384615385

1421680,5,B00005BCJO,"Just when I thought I was getting tired of anime, along comes The Big O to renew my faith in this medium.  The show takes several elements and fuses them into an exhilariting show that brims with style and the ""coolness"" factor.  Roger Smith is a perfect combination of Bruce Wayne/James Bond, but of course, those two heroes never had a giant robot to use when the need arises!  And there's Roger referring to Dorothy as ""R. Dorothy""...a tribute to the robot stories of Isaac Asimov, perhaps?  What also works for the show is the music.  It is is a combination of piano-based jazz and blues, then it will shift into an Akira Ifukube-type GODZILLA music with a bit of Bond thrown in, and then it changes into a rousing ""heroic"" theme. Even the opening theme is a tip of the hat to Queen's classic ""Flash"".  This DVD is worth it.  The Big O is the best thing to come along since Cowboy Bebop.  Dark deco, giant robots, mystery and intrigue, and style--this one's highly recommended.",994636800,,981,4.534090909090909
1421681,5,B00005BCJO,This is one of the best mecha anime to hit this states in a few years. It is about a negotiator named Roger Smith who uses the giant robot MegaDeuse. He meets an android named Dorothy an=d allows her to live with him. This series may be short but has many good characters including Norman the butler and the insane Schwarzwald(which is German for Black Forest).,993772800,,361,4.484848484848484
1421682,3,B00005BCJO,"Other reviews have told you what a great show BIG O is.  It is probably the best of the recent Anime imports.  The story line interesting and the characters and voices are well matched.  The reason I give it three stars is its implementation on the DVD.  As Roger Smith, the negotiator, says, ""...these things should be left to the professionals...""  The DVD is a disappointment.  The transfer is nice and runs well.  The real let down is the so called ""extras""...let's see four trailers for other BANDAI programs such as GUNDUM WING and an interview with the creators.  Oh, but it is not an ""interview"" it is five screens of text that basically has no point to it.  All I found out from the ""interview"" is that they wanted to market a toy!!!  One of the reasons you buy a DVD over another format is the extra eye candy and bonus features.  In BIG O vol. 1 the extras are quite frankly a BIG ZERO, unless you like BANDAI commercials.  Still I like the disk but I would wait for the price to drop on the next installments.",993513600,,1021,4.343915343915344
1421683,4,B00005BCJO,"I was going through an odd period where I wanted to see a tasteful reversion to the ""Golden Age"" of science fiction. Then, as if I had some say in ther matter, along comes The Big O.
  Noirish and sad, the characters plod their way through Paradigm City. Memories, like the contents of the box in ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" draw people toward them and their doom.
 Although The Big O draws imagery and mood from so many established sources (ie. Batman, Tetsujin 28 etc...) it can be construed as a alternate universe story line for any of them. I believe, however, that the show stands on its own.
 Besides, as Roger Smith will attest, we all stand on the sholders of giants.",993340800,,666,4.434426229508197
1421684,5,B00005BCJO,"I found this anime very good and very enjoyable. The plot was very confusing though and I always kept asking myself how in the hell this story could end without giving any sign that help us understand what was going on in the story,but guest what,they really made it. In the very 2 last episodes I said ""Oh that is what really happened"".It was fun because it really gives you the chance to imagine what the ending would be. It was a mix of batman,James Bon,and some mecha animes. I recomend the complete serie to everyone. I don't think the Cartoon Network's version of the serie was bad. They showed some blood,some killings and good action scenes. Buy it,you will not waste your money at all.",992822400,,694,4.515873015873016
1421685,3,B00005BCJO,"Batman fans will feel right at home watching the Big O. Offered overseas in subtitles, this dvd comes with the first 13 episodes, but because America can't apoligize to certain nations, the consumer can only get 4 episodes on Volume 1. The added feature to DVD is to have more on one disc and at better quality. It's like buying a 8 hour vhs tape and only recording a thirty second commercial. So why are we paying more? My suggestion is if you really want to get all the episodes with the least amount of dvd's, AND you want to save money, go to any online auction and get the entire series on one dvd for the same price for the four here. Only difference, is english overdub. This disc has it, the overseas don't, but it has english subtitles. Another suggestion, learn to read faster.",992304000,,787,4.397260273972603
1421686,5,B00005BCJO,"This show will appeal to kids because of the excellent animation and robot battles, but it is of far more value to more mature minds, who can appreciate the religious allusions, symbolism, deep characterization, subtle yet epic plot line, and genuinely witty dialogue that this series displays.  The voice acting is top notch and very well implemented.  Roger Smith's wry nature plays incredibly well off the characters he is always around such as (though not limited to): 1. Dorothy: a girlish female android who is genuinely hurt by Roger's scathing comments regarding her ""unfeeling"" robotic nature.  There is a certain ammount of romantic tension between these two, and Roger's uncertainty makes their relationship awkward. 2. Norman: a butler who pretends to agree with everything he says, with a genuinely sarcastic nature 3.  Angel: a completely mysterious free lance agent, who is always crossing Roger's path. 4.  Schwarzwald: an insane, suicidal maniac, who knows many secrets.  I love how he and Roger interract, because it is only around this bandaged, ranting mad-scientist that Roger acts dead-pan and cold.  Since they are rivals, its very interesting and realistic for Roger to hide his true emotions.  It also makes a very stark contrast. The plot is too complex to explain here, so I will simply say that it has the best themes I've ever seen in a cartoon.",991008000,5,1374,5.075555555555556
