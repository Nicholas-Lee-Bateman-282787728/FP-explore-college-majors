8173918,4,6303467318,"At times I've forgotten my own name, but I've never forgotten this movie. At first it seems like Polanski's Knife in the Water turning into Dead Calm, but instead it's completely original story comprises action elements as well as character-driven drama.
How smart then to get several very good actors before anyone knew them: Donal Logue, Viggo Mortenson, and Jeremy Sisto. Jeremy Sisto especially peefectly delivers a complex, daring role as a drifter who seems too gentle for this crowd but who surprises us with determination.
The twists you expect in an action film are here and reprised on a personal scale in the developments between the characters.

Now that I realize it's becoming hard to identify, I'm tracking down a copy so I don't have to rely on cable to see it.",1429315200,,777,4.842105263157895

8173920,5,6303467318,"The Crew. 1994. Dir: Carl Colpaert. ""Five people on weekend cruise stop to rescue a couple on a burning boat, only to find themselves tossed into a sexual soup peppered with cattiness and pop psychology"". Four stars. Out of five. Mmh. The ""Video Movie Guide 1999"" must have watched a different movie. Or maybe they got to see the parts that seem to be missing from the one I saw! In any case, the cattiness and the pop psychology make The Crew  almost a cult movie, I hadn't had such fun watching a movie since I saw my Spinal Tap or Monty Python and the Holy Grail DVDs. It also contains a lot of quotable phrases that you can throw in the face of anyone, specially another Viggo fan, in the most unexpected moments. Laughter is guaranteed.
It all begins with a mysterious title that says: ""A few months later, Miami"", which will have you pressing buttons on your VCR, thinking that the tape didn't fully rewind. But no, that is the beginning. Bill (Donald Logue) and Jennifer (Pamela Gidley), a married couple, get together with her brother at some dock. Phil (Viggo) owns a fabulous yacht and a flashing Mercedes.
On board they meet Catherine (Grace Zabriskie), who seems to be Phil's girlfriend du jour. Alex, a friend of Phil's, joins them last and so the crew is complete for this weekend cruise to the Bahamas. Soon the peculiarities emerge: Bill seems to suspect Jennifer and Alex, while the subjects of conversation range from protest songs to Catherine's med school exams, the AIDS virus and drunken writers, to asteroids that will pulverize the Earth in the year 2126. Philosophizing on such varied subjects, they barely notice a burning boat in their vicinity. Phil won't help them, he wants to call the coast guard, but the others make him once they see that the girls on board of it have jumped into the water. Instead of swimming to the strip of land just behind them, they swim all the way to the yacht. Mh!

But surprise! One of the girls is a boy, a ""heterosexual transsexual"", as he describes himself, named Tim (Jeremy Sisto), accompanied by Camila (Laura del Sol), who speaks little English. It turns out that Camila has no papers and Tim wants them to help him introduce her illegally into the US. Phil refuses, because he seems to be a little afraid of letting the authorities come too near. So Tim hijacks the boat, brandishing a gun, to go to a place where he can rendezvous with the mysterious George, the boyfriend we know about through the frantic calls his lover makes from the sea. Considering they've been hijacked, everybody is pretty relaxed, except Phil. Camila even dances some sort of rumba while Phil screams his head off arguing with Tim. He almost makes him cry! A few minutes later, the Bahamian coast guard appear, together with a helicopter whose co-pilot is Walter Mortensen. The bahamian's visit unnerves Phil, specially when the guy approaches the machine hold.

When they finally leave, Tim makes Phil take them to a strip of land where George is supposed to come and collect them. He forces everybody to stay at the beach and he remains on the yacht with Camila, waiting and making phone calls now and then, at a dollar a minute, as Phil reminds him. Meanwhile, tension is rising among the shipwrecks. Jennifer and Bill's marriage seems to be going through a crisis. Bill suspects infidelity, Phil doesn't help any with his innuendoes. Feeling isolated and miserable, Bill bonds more and more with the modern pirates, arousing the aggressivity of his brother-in-law. A waste of linguistic abilities occurs: it's Bill and not Phil who has a short conversation with Camila in Spanish. At about the same time that Phil unscrews the propeller without anybody noticing, Bill discovers a bunch of dollar bills hidden in the machine hold, which provokes a deliciously absurd argument. At some point, everybody screams at everybody, all of them seem to have something to hide and they really can't get anywhere now, because the propeller fell to the bottom of the sea. Poor Tim is desperate because his George is not going to come to the rescue, so after a breakdown he ends up in a tender embrace with Bill. They are thus discovered by Phil, who had managed to sneak into the boat, not without hitting the heck out of a surprised Camila first. He gets hold of the gun and kills Tim without apparent reason. He sort of regrets it afterwards, but has no time to reflect on his actions as he must jump into the sea to retrieve the money that was floating all over the place. (Hee, hee). Tim gets unceremoniously thrown overboard and the whole thing comes abruptly to an end.

Watch it with a friend! Viggo acts atrociously most of the time, waving his arms and hands around like a windmill and the others don't shine, either, most of them don't even take their sunglasses off. I wonder what they were thinking when speaking the dialogue? I can't begin to imagine. But you will have a great time, even at those moments that are supposedly serious, you will be surprised to find yourself in gales of merriment at the most unexpected moments. All through the movie, there are fabulous quotable phrases, like the one about the ""bad talk show topic"", or how about ""but I luurve your music"", and dozens more. After watching it a couple of times, you'll have the dialogue down pat and then you will be able to organize ""The Crew Parties"", inviting other Viggo fans to quote aloud those fabulous sentences, all together now. Also, in spite of it all, Viggo looks gorgeous and in shorts, like in en G.I. Jane. Another curious fact is that Henry Mortensen gets a thank you in the end credits. Oh! And the song! Classic!",1348358400,4,5646,4.6656626506024095
8173921,1,6303467318,The plot is bad and the actors as well. Not recommended unless you are a very avid Viggo Mortensen fan.,1318636800,,103,4.2
8173922,3,6303467318,"One of the main characters is Phillip who has money, is a lawyer and has a boat. Four of them go off to sea for the weekend having a good time. Then they end up picking up two strangers that end up reacking havock on board the ""Retainer"" (name of boat). There is descention among the original members that leads to an exciting ending. This is a good movie featuring Viggo and it also deals with the homophobia and a prostitute. Which makes Viggo's character, Phillip a pig. But all in all a good flick.",1064966400,9,502,4.294736842105263
