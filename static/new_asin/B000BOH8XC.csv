2432090,5,B000BOH8XC,"Simple, to the point, extremerly challenging, intensive workout, you can feel the fat melting away and you are left with a sense of achievement and exhaustion. I have never lost so much weight in so little time simply from doing this video every second day for 2 weeks. Ultimate choice for cardio fitness!",1229385600,4,305,4.773584905660377
2432091,5,B000BOH8XC,I used Energy Spring when it first came out in the early 90's... sooooohappy it is now on DVD . It is a challenge to do it but it is really worth it.,1216598400,,149,3.5454545454545454
2432092,5,B000BOH8XC,"I LOVE Karen Voight's ""Energy Sprint!""  It is for advanced intermediates to advanced exercisers only (in other words, this is not the dvd to start with as a beginner!).  A great mix of some strength training blended with step and floor aerobics.  I especially like the floor aerobics at the end.  While not generally a fan of floor aerobics, it is a nice segment and really helps keep my routine varied.  You will definitely feel like you have accomplished something, when you make it through this entire workout!",1187395200,4,513,4.784090909090909
2432093,4,B000BOH8XC,"This DVD is a great overall workout because it incorporates cardio (which happens to be stepping) with some excellent targeted toning routines.  But if you're interested in a true step aerobics workout, I'd recommend just about any other workout that incorporates stepping except this one (Gin Miller, Gilad and Kari Anderson have some good step-only workouts).

I love Karen Voight and this is a fantastic workout for overall fitness.  She is careful to explain proper technique and offers exercises that efficiently work target areas.  I was just disappointed in the stepping portion of this particular workout.",1182384000,,613,5.354166666666667
2432094,5,B000BOH8XC,"Energy Sprint is an advanced workout for those starting to exercise and an invigorating challenge for those who have already achieved a high level of fitness. Spending 80 minutes on exercise requires determination, stamina and dedication!

You can either use a step/bench or work your way up to using it. The step Karen sells is great as you can use it at different height levels to increase the intensity of the exercises. This workout is a bit different than normal step workouts. You will notice a ""Sprint Timer"" which will appear when the intensity level goes up. The timer helps to keep you going right to the last second even though the exercises are very challenging at that point.

Energy Sprint is based on ""Interval Training."" You will alternate between high and low levels of intensity. Karen is known for her innovative workout programs and this in a good example of how she uses full range of motion, control of movement and repetitions which ensure you will change your shape and reach your goals.

Karen owns the Voight Fitness and Dance Center in Los Angeles, CA where she keeps her clients in top shape. She excels in clarity of instruction and creative style of motion. She incorporates some of her classic ""Karen Moves"" into this video and also focuses on many unique step moves you won't see anywhere else.

Have your step all ready to go when you put in this video. Karen jumps right into the first 40 minute aerobic section, keeps you moving through 15 minutes of butt and leg exercises, helps you shape your arms and upper body for 15 minutes and then spends 12 minutes showing you how to get those abs in shape.

There is a heart rate check during this workout, but you will want to monitor your heart rate during the aerobics section as some of the exercises are pretty intense. Don't let that stop you from ordering this video.

While it is the hardest video I have ever done in my life, I feel incredibly good after I get through it. I can tell a difference in my circulation, my body is warm for hours and I feel very alert and ready to face life's next challenge. If you are serious about fitness, this is the workout you will want add to your workout video collection.

2432095,5,B000BOH8XC,"Although karen voight is one of the best instructors available, along with kathy smith and gilad, this is a must have of all her dvds, as it totally marvellous, she keeps you going all the time and the workout is really complete, you feel great after it.",1162425600,8,254,4.425531914893617
2432096,5,B000BOH8XC,"This workout is really good in my opinion. It is very squat-intensive. The reasons I like it are:

- Although when you first watch it, it seems simple and rather slow, it really kicks your butt. The reason is kicks your butt is because of all the squats and other moves that require a lot of leg strength. She does a good job of engineering weight bearing moves in an aerobic fashion - quite a feat, I think.

- The moves are simple and easy to follow. She's good about showing them to you first and giving you warning before a change.

- Even though the moves are simple, it's still fun and challenging.

- It's a nice long cardio workout. Sometimes I skip this section in the middle that is not terribly aerobic; and even skipping that and the sculpting routines at the end, the aerobic part comes to about 45 minutes, I believe.

- The ab section is quite good. It's 13 minutes long.

- I believe she only miscounts once.

- There is really only one time, that I can think of, where the camera cuts during a transition or new move.",1152230400,17,1034,4.271794871794872
2432097,5,B000BOH8XC,"Karen Voight is among the best instructors out there.  I truly believe there are only about 6-7 exceptional instructors and she is one of them.  She knows her stuff, she is motivating and she cues well and she's friendly enough to not be intimidating.

This is a tough and fast paced program (you WILL sweat).  This is a combination workout of step aerobics and regular toning.  There are seven sprints (tough and challenging but rewarding when you see the results or you do more each time).  There is also an ab workout done on the floor.

If you want a toned body and also want to get fitter, then this dvd is for you.  I highly recommend it to everyone.",1145059200,6,656,4.408333333333333
2432098,4,B000BOH8XC,"Energy Sprint is an endurance building step workout, but this 83 minute program has toning work as well.  This 1993 video is possibly the best workout that Karen has ever put out, and it's finally on DVD, a very well chaptered DVD at that.  You can choose to do those entire workout, or there is a mix and match feature where you can choose which segments you wish to do.  Here is a breakdown of the chapters....

warmup - 6 1/2 minutes

quads, hamstrings, etc - 8 1/2 minutes

calves, inner thighs, sprints 1 & 2 - 10 minutes

sprints 3-4 - 10 minutes

sprints 5-7 - 23 minutes

upper body - 12 minutes

abs and stretch - 13 minutes

When I do this workout I do the cardio work only so it is nice that I can jump right to that feature following the warmup.  Rather than fast forward through the brief lower body toning session.  The whole cardio is about 40 minutes of step aerobics including 7 sprints ranging from 1 1/2-5 minutes each.  Karen shows you the steps prior to going into the sprint and following each sprint she takes you through a recovery phase.  The choreography isn't too difficult to master, Karen is not known for complex steps.  But she does a good job calling all the moves and leading the workout in general.  Karen is an excellent instructor, some perceive her as being too wooden or dry but she is pleasant and encouraging.  She does offer options to make the sprints more difficult, plus she also give you tips on making it easier so you can last the whole sprint until your endurance level improves.  All of the sprints are step aerobics except the very last one which is low impact.  Preceding the aerobic portion is a brief lower body toning segment using the step but no weights, following the aerobic portion is an upper body section which uses light dumbells, and there also an ab session before the cooldown and stretch.  Karen has quite a few participants joining her, men and women all using various step heights.  Two of the participants even do the workout without the step.  So all levels can do this video, although beginners should start carefully and progress slowly.  Karen does have a guest, Wayne Westcott who briefly explains how the sprints work before the workout gets underway.

As previously mentioned, this video was filmed in 1993 so some might think it's a bit dated.  I think it's great, I like the music a lot, I think it fits the workout well.  Some of it is rock sounding with guitars, while I don't have all of Karen's videos, I have always thought that she picks great music for her workouts.  Even though they might not be as upbeat or funky sounding as some of the music for todays workouts.

This is an excellent workout, you get a lot for the price.  A must have if you need to build cardio endurance.  Glad that it is finally on DVD.  I give this one 4 1-2 stars.",1143936000,32,2827,4.429126213592233
2432099,2,B000BOH8XC,"I find Karen Voight's choreography extremely awkward.

Also, she will often switch movements without cueing.  She'll cue you as she's doing the new movement, so she's already switched by the time she gets around to cueing you.  Very frustrating.

On the plus side, it's a decent aerobic workout, if you can deal with the awkwardness and the cueing deficiencies.

For better instructors, Gin Miller, Gay Gasper,  Kathy Smith, Keli Roberts, Christi Taylor (if you're an advanced stepper, Christi Taylor is the best!)",1142985600,9,514,5.2073170731707314
2432100,5,B000BOH8XC,Had this years ago on VHS and didn't remember how much I enjoyed it until I just got it on DVD.  It's a basic (no dancey moves) workout but definitely intense and Karen shows ways to up the intensity (or not).  I like that they show two people who aren't using steps.,1392076800,2,267,4.115384615384615
2432101,5,B000BOH8XC,"This is just perfect for rising and exercising every morning before breakfast!

From beginning to end, I enjoy the challenges it brings.",1349654400,,136,5.181818181818182
2432102,5,B000BOH8XC,"This is a GREAT workout! All of Karen's workouts are challenging and get results, but this one is fun because you can choose which routines you want to do and even the order you want to do them in.  The ""sprint"" segments are very challenging and will definitely get your heart pumping.  The weight and leg segments are also great for targeting thighs, buttocks, arms and abs.  The music is engaging and Karen's cues are, as always, perfect. I love this workout and do it every other day (I do her weighted workouts the other days).",1341792000,2,531,4.510416666666667
2432103,4,B000BOH8XC,"I have always loved Karen Voight and this particular workout is one I've been familiar with since the early 90s when I first bought the video tape - yes!  way back in the day! - the tape wore out years ago so I was pleased to be able to purchase the DVD and re-live my youth.  I have to say, the cardio section is as much fun and as good as I remembered, but the upper body, lower body, and ab workouts are no more strenuous than easy toning exercises.  If you're looking for toning, this is a pretty good choice.  If you want definition, however, you'll need to suppliment the exercises.",1303430400,2,588,4.223214285714286
2432104,5,B000BOH8XC,"I remember buying this on videotape in 1995.  I had just joined the Navy.  I may have passed the physical readiness test during training but didn't feel I was in overall good military shape.  This got me into shape and helped me stay in shape during my four years in the Navy.  I was ecstatic to see it is now on DVD since my videotape was starting to get worn down.  Though it may seem outdated (check out the folks with sweat bands and unitards) it still kicks you in the butt and makes you sweat, burning calories all 80 minutes.",1295740800,5,532,4.227722772277228
2432105,5,B000BOH8XC,"I have had this DVD for a couple of years and find it to be one of the best in my arsenal.  The cardio is excellent.  KV does a great job with the cues and doesn't run the same move for so long that you get bored.  Once she wears you out (and I come away from this routine red-faced every time), she takes you through a good sculpt routine and then abs routine.  She finishes off with a good cool down.  All the elements and put togther in an easily-followed format but carries enough challenge not to get boring.  I have several of KV's DVD's and I like most of them but this is my absolute favorite.  Thanks KV!",1277683200,4,613,4.058333333333334
2432106,4,B000BOH8XC,"I have a few Karen Voight Dvds and she's a good trainer. She works your body from head to toe in this one. You can do the moves with a step or just on the floor. The sprints are challenging. I wouldn't call the weight section challenging to me, but I do most of my weight sculpting with Jari Love and this isn't even in the same range as Jari. The weight section is okay. The ab workout is good as are all the ab portions of Karen Voights workouts.",1262736000,4,448,3.988888888888889
2432107,5,B000BOH8XC,"I have been doing this workout since I first bought it on VHS in the early 90s, and it is still the best total-body workout that I own.  I have yet to find an instructor that cues better than Karen Voight.  I love that the energy sprints (7 total) get progressively longer, rather than shorter, as you go through the workout.  Plus, the lower body toning section is at the very beginning, which makes this video even more challenging.  She offers different variations of the exercises so that you may choose to stay low impact, or as you become more fit, start adding in more difficult moves.  I highly recommend it.",1260576000,3,616,4.513513513513513
2432108,5,B000BOH8XC,this is by far the best work out video i have done. it gives you a complete workout and you can see visible changes in your body like the next day. AMAZING,1250208000,4,155,3.875
2432109,5,B000BOH8XC,"As a new KV fan, I am very impressed with her workouts. Her demeanor is serious, yet fun, and her workouts are very challenging. I really like the thorough warmup that's just right -- not too slow or long, and gets the heart rate up a bit. As a woman in my early 40's with a slower metabolism, small kids, full-time job, extra baby weight and NOT working out for the last few years, this was the answer for me.

Having tried her 3 other workouts, Calorie Burn, Get Firm Fast, and Burn & Firm, I really enjoy her teaching style and look forward to working out, unlike with The Firm or Jillian Michael's  30 Day Shred. You can easily adapt the workout to your fitness level, and the step routines do not hurt your knees -- and this is coming from someone with very heavy legs who does not look forward to repetitive step work.

If you are a fan of the ""old school"" fun type of aerobics that really put you into your target heart zone while still having fun and sweating like crazy, this workout is for you. You will feel SO refreshed afterward.

Also, you can mix and match the workout and only do upper, lower, abs, or cardio on any given day. I especially like the ""sprint timer"" for the cardio portions. It causes me to REALLY push, because I know it will be over soon! Hope to be able to update you with some weight loss results soon. By the way, I used my heart rate monitor. I completed 40 minutes of this workout the first time,burned 519 calories, and stayed in my target zone for 30 minutes.",1249171200,4,1498,4.264084507042254
