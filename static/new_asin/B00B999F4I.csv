5564324,3,B00B999F4I,"This film is a low action drama. It has heavy dialouge. Unless you are a returning combat vet, the monologues of Sgt. Devon Carter (Tory Kittles) grow boring.

Marine Lt. Sam Drake (Chadwick Boseman) has trouble adjusting to civilian life. He is a cab driver and part of a support group. He is haunted by an episode where he was responsible for sweeping a village, of which we don't get too much detail. Unknown to Drake, his action was espied by Carter, who likewise was there on a secret mission which conflicted with Drakes. Because Drake was ""cold hearted"" in his style Carter decides he must get revenge against the private firm that was giving orders to Drake. This whole aspect is confusing, suffice to say neither one of these guys was playing with a full deck.

The film moves slow. The action is minimal. The Drake/Carter confrontation is the centerpiece of the film, something that consisted of dialouge explaining ""kill hole"" a bunch of us/them pawns stuff, some military songs, and poorly written head games. Drake proclaims that they were simply good people who did a bad thing and must move on, while Carter apparently never went to group.

This is a film I wanted to enjoy, but did not. At the end of the film we get to see that the guys in group were actual military or former military personnel. I salute you guys and my advice is don't quit your day jobs...and you need to learn to write better reviews.

5564325,5,B00B999F4I,i just purchased the dvd today and it was fantastic.  the story was very compelling; the actors were superb; and the scenery magnificient.  i watched it with my wife. she had to grimace a few times during the more violent parts of the movie but i loved it.,1365465600,2,256,4.3125
5564326,5,B00B999F4I,I caught a screening of this at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and was blown away as were the people in attendance. The acting was superb and Chad Boseman is sure to be a big star. Billy Zane gave a stellar performance as well as the rest of the cast. The storyline was gripping to say the least and it had me wondering which direction I would be pulled in next. I would definitely check this movie out.,1365465600,3,404,4.1923076923076925
5564327,5,B00B999F4I,"Don't usually leave comments but DAMN I had to leave something on this One. Seen it a few weeks back in theaters while I was in New York. Awesome movie was surprised to see Chadwick Boseman as the lead character (same actor who plays Jackie Robinson in 42) and Peter Greene is always a good actor to see always puts on a great performance. Also was pleased to see the good production values it was a nice touch to the movie. Definitely, adding this one to the collection.",1365379200,4,471,4.363636363636363

5564329,5,B00B999F4I,"Saw this in Portland and really liked it.  Intense acting by the leads, including Chadwick Boseman of ""42"" who was great.  Beautifully filmed, capturing the scenic NW wilderness.  The complex relationship between Drake and Carter was really powerful, and sort of snuck up on me.  I found myself thinking about this one for quite a while.",1365292800,5,337,4.964285714285714

5564331,5,B00B999F4I,"I just saw this movie in the theater and thought it was excellent.  I had never seen Chad Boseman until Kill Hole and now I understand why they cast him in 42.  The acting (Chad Boseman, Billy Zane, Peter Green, et al) were superb; the scenery was beautiful; and the story was very compelling.  Very smartly done.",1364860800,,313,4.456140350877193

5564354,4,B00B999F4I,"This is not the typical movie I would watch. I wanted to see my favorite actor, Chadwick Boseman, in this movie so that is what drawed me to it. It is not bad. I think the actor who played besides Chad's character (Tory Kittles) did really well as well as the actor who played the leader of the support group.

I do not recommend if you are not a fan of cursing and mild violence. I probably won't watch a movie like this...if only Chad is in it! LOL",1410393600,,450,4.056179775280899

5564361,1,B00B999F4I,"This movie is loaded with repeated use of the F word and there are also several scenes of intense violence, yet it's marketed both on Amazon and at the video store as PG-13. Unless the MPAA has recently relaxed their standards without telling anyone else in the movie industry about it, this is a solid R film.

I gave this film one star partly because it is being represented with the wrong rating, but mostly because it's just not very good. I have to wonder if the people giving this movie 5-stars even watched the same film. The actors try to make the best of it, but it's difficult to get around the random story line and the poor directing. Don't waste your time on this one unless you've just decided you want to watch every movie about Iraq war veterans for some reason.",1366416000,3,778,4.402777777777778
8564517,4,B00B999F4I,I only watched this because of Chadwick Boseman. This is a compelling story that shows how our veterans are casualties too. It is so sad. I really wish America did a better job with them when they return home. Tory Kittles and Billy Zane are impressive as well.  Itasca good movie.,1519516800,,281,4.509803921568627

8564524,4,B00B999F4I,"The Kill Hole is about a man (Chadwick Boseman) who is approached by a couple (hilariously clichd) intelligence agents who digs up some history on Chadwick and basically force him to search and kill an Iraqi war veteran (Billy Zane) that's been on the run for a while.  Billy lives in the forest/grasslands of the Pacific Northwest wilderness.  Chadwick doesn't really have a choice in the matter but to go because otherwise the two agents would turn Chadwick in for some previous crimes.  The setting is really appealing the way it jumps from the city to the forest areas.  It's quite the surprise!

Anyway Chadwick quickly learns to fight on his own with weapons, however without spoiling too much, it soon becomes obvious that he's no match for Billy.  After all Billy's been in the wilderness for a while and knows a thing or two about not only survival but detection of his surroundings, so anything that looks or feels out of place will raise a red flag in Billy's mind.  The communication between the two is really magnificent I think and opens my eyes about who the enemies really are (in relation to the subject matter of war, the unpredictable actions of men, etc).

Another side plot is that Chadwick is recovering from his previous time in war and the horrible regrettable things he's done.  Things that Billy knows about curious enough.  Often we see Billy attending talk/recovery groups for returning soldiers and having honest conversations with his fellow soldiers.  Good writing here.  But the movies strong point is the way Chadwick and Billy communicate with each other.  I wouldn't say a friendship develops necessarily, but for two soldiers that have been through so much, they can relate to each other in a way.  Chadwick's narration is really good too.

Looking back, perhaps the storyline is slightly lacking compared to other war movies.  But this one has good enough writing, action and quiet/low key atmosphere that it's worth recommending.  It is on the short side however compared to most war films, which is the only negative I can find.  Otherwise really good movie.  I wish I could make out one of Chadwick's actions 20 minutes before the ending however.  I won't spoil it, but it didn't really make sense why he... did that.  Not really a flaw though.",1446854400,,2284,4.820051413881748

excellent.  I really enjoyed the real vets that talked about their experience in the armed services and the challenges they faced coming
back to civilian life.  We owe so much to these
men.  I feel we should do so much more for them.  They deserve the best that America has
Ato offer and more.",1413849600,2,339,4.333333333333333
