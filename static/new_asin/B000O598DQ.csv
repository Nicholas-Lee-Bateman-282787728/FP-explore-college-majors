8182828,5,B000O598DQ,"For the first 20 years after the Apollo Lunar Landing Program that lasted from 1969-1972 very little information was available to the general public  about this historic project that put man on the moon.  The American taxpayer had invested something like $25 Billion in the program, and while there were undeniable benefits to the United States in the political realm, as well as the technological and scientific, from this huge investment, but unfortunately the average citizen who had an above average interest in this great adventure had little access to the actual records of the flights and the scientific and technological work that accompanied it, leading to a great  feeling of frustration, at least  on my own part.
Fortunately, the proliferation of personal computer technology plus digital audio and video in the 1990's made it possible for intrepid individuals, on a volunteer basis, to begin to systematically go through the transcripts and records of the flights and begin to edit them and bring them to the general public's attention and make sure that future generations would have easy access to the historical record of man's first steps on another world.
The most important of these volunteers is Eric Jones who decided to go through the transcripts  of each of the six successful moon landings and make them available to anyone who was interested.  Jones decided to cover, in each flight, the period from the time the Lunar Module is making its approach for landing, through the landings themselves, the extra-vehicular activities  of the crews on the lunar surface and ending up with the launch of the Lunar Module Ascent Stage from the surface in order to return home to Earth.
However, Jones does not simply make  do with transcribing the communication of the astronauts who made the landing with Mission Control in Houston, he gives a detailed explanation and commentary of each action taken by the astronauts, either involving the flight of the Lunar Module, technical  activities involving the LM or other equipment, or the scientific aspects of the geological work they did on the Lunar surface. Jones makes highly technical or scientific concepts accessible to anyone with some background in science or engineering.  What is most important is that Jones made contact with and interviewed  at least one astronaut from each of the six successful landings which was invaluable for clarifying difficult points and getting the personal observations of those who actually participated in this most exciting adventure.  He also makes extensive use of the post-flight debriefings of the crews that were made at the time and thus are fresh, first-hand obervations.  Jones also discusses interesting ""sidelights"" like whether or not it was a coincidence that six of the seven Mission Commanders who had the job  of piloting the Lunar Module down to the surface of the Moon (including the unsuccessful  Apollo 13 mission) had backgrounds as Naval aviators, whereas only one (Dave Scott of Apollo 15) was an Air Force man (the concensus of all the astronauts who were asked this question said it was a coincidence and that Air Force men would have made as good LM commanders as well if given the chance).

In addition to the transcripts,  there are many short films of the landings and other activities, including Neil Armstrong's historic first step on the Moon, numerous photographs taken on the lunar surface including panoramas assembled by David Harland, plus short articles describing the Lunar Module, the geology equipment, the pressure suits  worn by the astronauts and many other such subjects.

In short, anyone who really wants  to immerse his or herself in the lunar exploration experience will find the material here invaluable and even addicting.  As I indicated above, all of us who are fascinated by the space program and lunar exploration and all future generations who will build on this owe  a debt of  gratitude to Eric Jones and all those who joined in his work to make this great gift available to all of us.",1202774400,5,4047,5.061746987951807
