5819252,5,B00DIZS4LQ,This is one of the best recordings now available. Very moving and the sound was incredible. All the soloists were superb..,1381017600,4,122,4.857142857142857
5819253,4,B00DIZS4LQ,"We have under Maestro Barenboim almost the best Verdi Requiem line up currently - Harteros, the best Verdian Soprano currently singing (even if not Italian), Kaufmann (the spinto tenor of choice of every opera house), Rene Pape (the hottest bass singer in Europe) and Elina Garanca (star mezzo-soprano).
It is wonderful experience to watch these great performers perform than merely listening to them, so this DVD release, even if the camera-work is not top-notch, ranks over the CD release.
It would have been infinitely better if the camera man would catch the soloists' interaction with the chorus and each other than focusing at so many moments on the conductor ALONE.
The chorus of La Scala has a superb history of singing this Verdian masterpiece, and they do it marvelously this time round.
Watching the four soloists, immediately one becomes aware that Garanca is not (yet) a Verdian singer. Not only does the voice find difficulty riding the orchestra and chorus, but even in duets or soloists' ensembles, the mezzo-soprano voice 'caved in' in the wake of Pape's sonorous bass, Kaufmann's incisive tenor and Harteros's highly flexible lirico-spinto soprano. One would have thought that Daniela Barcellona would have done better here.
Personal problems have robbed much colour from Anja Harteros's heart-shaped face, but luckily not her vocal lustre. This current Verdian soprano of choice gives perhaps the most affecting performance here, shining above Kaufmann and Pape's otherwise impeccably moving performances.
One cannot wish for an all-Italian Verdi Requiem with Cecilia Bartoli, Andrea Bocelli (under Gergiev already), Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (under Gergiev) and Carmen Giannatassio, so this non-Italian line up is about the best one can get currently, am afraid.
So, despite the less than perfect shooting, still a front-ranking item of this repertoire.
Despite the superb vocal cast, the camera work is clumsy, and the sound isn't pristine.",1379289600,4,1958,5.401960784313726
5819254,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"I have seen and heard many Verdi Requiems and this one has become my new favorite.  Baremboim's conducting strikes a perfect balance of exacting control and all-out Italianate passion, the orchestra and chorus producing sounds both spiritually ethereal and secularly voluptous.  The four soloists are equal to illustrious colleagues of Requiems past.  All of them have beautiful voices of course, but what makes this performance so satisfying is the complete commitment each singer makes to the text.  This Requiem really grasps the viewer as a ""drama.""  I do not hesitate in giving this dvd my highest reccommendation and unlike the other reviewer, my disc was flawless.",1379289600,7,671,5.2924528301886795
5819255,2,B00DIZS4LQ,"I would be interested in knowing if any other purchasers of this Blu-ray (or DVD) have the same reaction as I.  While the performances are of top quality, the video is almost unwatchable owing to a jerkiness in the video often seen in non-professional transfers from European t.v. being played on American equipment, but NEVER in a professional release.  Especially the shots of Barenboim who, of course, is constantly moving almost resemble a slow-motion movie and not a smooth one, either!  There is also a strange momentary ""flicker"" when moving between camera shots.  Shame on DECCA for not taking the time to rectify this problem.  In this day and age where the ultimate in video and audio are expected, this is unacceptable.  If anyone knows of a solution or why this performance was released like this, please feel free to comment.",1379116800,9,838,4.907801418439717
5819256,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"I have always treasured Giulinis 1964 reading of Verdis Manzoni Requiem (with his dream team of soloists: Schwarzkopf  Ludwig  Gedda -- Ghiaurov) and perhaps used it as a subconscious blueprint when appreciating other performances, either live or recorded. On DVD, my favorite has been Abbados deeply felt and searing 2001 recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker, still in very good sound and more than respectable video. Maazels more recent interpretation with the Symphonica Toscanini (2007, see my review) I found disappointing. Yes, this is the verbatim beginning of my comments on Gustavo Dudamels new Verdi Requiem  and I repeat it here, as I want to put my cards on the table for the following review of Daniel Barenboims almost simultaneously released recording. I will not even attempt to compare the two readings: they are vastly different in their respective conceptions, but equally fine.

The Requiem was recorded live in August 2012 at the Teatro alla Scala, an immense theatre, and the challenges for both sound engineers and film crew must have been severe. I respectfully disagree with some fellow-reviewers and find both the audio and the video for the most part very good, if not always outstanding. Not only are the Scala acoustics tamed and focused quite well, the video is relatively sharp, given the difficulty of recording placement and angle. The camera work, however, is not entirely to my satisfaction: too many long shots on the maestro  the soloists rightly get plenty of attention  and the very fine, huge Coro del Teatro alla Scala, too little focus on the orchestra musicians who play very well indeed. One should not forget that Verdi could be a brilliant orchestrator: the Requiem is ample proof of this. The repeated pans through the theatre are useless and annoying.

Barenboim has a stellar quartet of soloists with Anja Harteros, Elina Garanca, Jonas Kaufmann and Ren Pape, and they give their all for his monumental reading of the score. Harteros, Kaufmann and Pape  the latter despite a few quirky pronunciation glitches  are thoroughly familiar with Verdi, Garanca seems somewhat in awe at times, but carries her part very well. What she may occasionally lack in sheer vocal power (at least on this particular evening), she amply makes up with musical beauty. From the first hushed notes of the Kyrie through the overwhelming cataclysm of the Dies Irae, a stupendous Mors stupebit, a highly expressive Liber scriptus  Garanca shining out  and Quid sum miser with an exquisite dialogue of Harteros and Kaufmann, the quartet perfect in Salva me and a wonderful Recordare  listen to the angelic duet of soprano and mezzo  to one of the finest tenor solos on record in the Ingemisco, you will be spellbound with this performance. Barenboim conducts his large forces with intense concentration, and even during those moments when he seemingly gives them free rein, there is no doubt that all is painstakingly rehearsed. Among the many high points there is a formidable Lacrymosa punctuated by percussion, a glittering tenor solo in the Hostias, the festive Sanctus and hushed Agnus Dei with both female soloists tender and moving I could go on and on, but listen for yourself. This is Daniel Barenboims Requiem. And it is a great Requiem, here to stay with us for many years to come.",1395273600,16,3322,5.051188299817184
5819257,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"Absolutely loved it, from beginning to the end. I have recommended it to my friends and they want to own a copy as we'll.",1393891200,2,121,4.083333333333333
5819258,4,B00DIZS4LQ,"With this DVD one can understand why I often consider this my favorite Verdi opera.  Elina Garanca is amazing.  The others are, of course, no slouches!  Worth the price just to see Daniel Barenboim's expressions while conducting,",1392854400,,229,5.135135135135135
5819259,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"This is an exhilarating experience both visually and aurally. How wonderful that Barenboim is havng such success with Verdi this late in his career. The excitement and power is there in all the big movements and the tempi shouldn't upset anyone. There is clarity and drive in all the big choral fugues and the climaxes will knock your socks off. But it was the quiet moments I found most moving. The incredibly detalied camera work increases this sense of intimacy and the video quality is excellent. Really.

Other reviewers are concerned about the lack of clairty and a slight blurring. This was shot in a theatre with theatre lights, not a studio; there is warmth to the images which may well have been an aesthetic choice by the film director. It works. The camera work is busy but never annoying and never did I feel that an important moment was not being captured. Not only that,  there are also brief, candid glimpses of soloists or choir members having a moment or a tuba playing being distracted  which adds to the sense of a live performance being captured. This is also achieved by the spectacular sound, particularly in the capturing of the chorus. Never have I heard the power and detail of a large chorus so effectively caught. You will literally hear if one chorister comes in a milisecond early, which, again, adds to that feeling of being in the room.

Barenboim, conducting without a score, is fascinating to watch. At times controlling every subdivision and at others giivng almost free reign, The soloists are all terrific (although I found Pape a little foggy, if wonderfully musical). You will find better singing across the board from stellar soloists of the past (how do you complete with a Leontyne Price in this piece?) but it is pointless to see that as a reason for not buying this. They are singers at the top of their game and all are so involved in the performance.  This is a top notch performance that can hold its head up high with any of the famous ones from the past, yet it comes with such added power from the wonderful technology that makes those of us with smaller bank accounts feel as though we are there enjoying La Scala with the big haried Italian society ladies.",1390176000,11,2208,4.651282051282052
5819260,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"Wonderful, wonderful. The more familiar you become with it, the better it gets. What a conducting marathon for Daniel Barenboim who conducted not only the orchestra but also the chorus and the four soloists-  Anja Harteros, Ilena Garanca, Jonas Kaufmann, and Rene' Pape. So much talent, skill, and energy assembled at the Teatro alla Scala",1388707200,3,339,5.163636363636364
5819261,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"All four of the principal singers are first rate, especially Garanca and Kaufmann. The chorus sings with beauty and power and the orchestra is magnificent. One of the best recordings of the Requiem I've heard or seen. Highly recommended.",1388188800,2,237,5.102564102564102
5819262,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"I own five CD's or DVD's of the Verdi Requiem with different artists performing.  This one is great.  All the soloists were first-rate, but Jonas Kaufmann was sensational.",1387670400,2,171,5.071428571428571
5819263,1,B00DIZS4LQ,"The audio quality of this recording is sub-standard. It sounds like something overloaded in the recording chain causing excessive  amounts of distortion. The stereo layer is better than the 5.1 DTS layer but the distortion is still audible.

What a shame because the performance is so impressive. As the multichannel layer is so distorted as to make this disk unlistenable, I'm giving it one star.

For reference, my listening equipment is an Oppo disk player, NAD receiver and Klipsch speakers.",1387152000,9,495,5.1625

5819265,5,B00DIZS4LQ,"I do  not think there was or will be a better performance of the Requiem  I found perfect every aspect of it. The Orchestra, the chorus, the Conductor and all of the soloists were excellent.  I cannot describe the feeling I had when Jonas Kaufman starts the Kyrie Eleyson. I can listen to this Requiem again and again.  I should mention the quality of the filming.  The camera men did an excellent job.",1381449600,12,402,4.4520547945205475

THE BEGINNING WAS A TREAT, BUT WHEN JOHN KAUFMAN'S TENOR SOARED THROUGH THE LIVING FROM I FROZE, SO DID MY GUESTS. THE SOPRANO HAS LITERALLY A STRAIN FREE PURE VOICE AND THE CONTRALTO IS THE FINEST I'VE HEARD  SINGING  THIS REQUIEM ROLE.

The cinematography is so rich, it is a joy to watch.  Only thing that it could use is a little more oomph in the sound, thought it is very clear and sepatated to enjoy all.",1396396800,3,443,4.116279069767442
