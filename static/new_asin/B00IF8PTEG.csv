6263306,5,B00IF8PTEG,Rating is for the packaging which is steelbook in my opinion the coolest packaging a movie can have.

6263321,3,B00IF8PTEG,"No booklet or anything. For a fancy 'steelbook' they really cut corners in all other aspects. Doesn't feel like something worth paying more money for. Initially I did because the movie itself is fantastic. But there's not much special about this actual product, physically.",1463356800,,273,5.2272727272727275

8641828,2,B00IF8PTEG,"""Steelbook"" is ridiculous. Who cares what kind of case it comes in? What is important is WHAT'S IN the case! As far as the film, the Unrated Director's Cut is much better.",1474502400,,171,4.375
