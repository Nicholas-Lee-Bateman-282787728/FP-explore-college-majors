From DR. NO through and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE this is yet another collection of James Bond  films from the series. This is a very good collection.

You get the entire series to date from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. This is one of those ""must have"" collections. From Sean Connery to Daniel Craig and think about that one moment. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig all played James Bond on the screen in in 22 films over five decades. The diversity of the films, the actors, the directors, the technicians and all the other filmmakers is astounding. We all have our favorite films and our favorite actors portraying James Bond. It is really hard to express an opinion here other than to say that this sums it up for the first 50 years and I am glad that all the films are finally in one set. Amazing when you think about it.

It is interesting at the 50 year milestone to reflect on the films and actors that have portrayed James Bond. I think we like all the films to some extent and some more than others. Some of the films are very endearing to us and others less endearing. We have our favorites. We can be passionate about such things. For me I suppose Sean Connery is the one and only James Bond. I grew up in that era. I lived through those magical times. The Bonds that followed are his and the original filmmakers' legacy. There is the natural progression of the series that continues to this day. The films I like in particular are DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. For one reason or another I find these endearing and I enjoy watching them over and over again.

Of all the actors that have portrayed James Bond I believe that Sean Connery embodied everything that there was that made his James Bond an icon. Of the actors that followed, my favorite is George Lazenby. He makes one film that is arguably one of the best and for the first time he brought some depth to the character that was closer to Ian Fleming's literary creation and never explored in Connery's films. George Lazenby looks very good and acts very good during certain scenes and moments and then in a split second his acting appears awkward. He lacked consistency in that department. Yet, overall he visually appears very confident, self reliant and has a certain self assuredness about him. That is the George Lazenby I remember and he was James Bond.

Roger Moore brought his own interpretation to the role. I thought it was fine. In the Roger Moore films the greater participation of the team of M, Q, Moneypenny and Fredrick Gray (a regular addition to the cast in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) changed and augmented the dynamics of the films. Soviet General Gogol (also added as a regular character in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME ) was also added into the mix. For me it all culminated in A VIEW TO A KILL. It is an end of an era in some ways. Lois Maxwell had been in every film as Miss Moneypenny and her playful banter with Bond first seen with Sean Conney in DR. NO finally came to a cheerful finale with Roger Moore in A VIEW TO A KILL. More or less, we saw them age gracefully and nostalgically over that span of time.

I like Timothy Dalton's James Bond. The films returned to a much harder edged Bond. I liked Dalton's thinking man's no nonsense approach. I liked his approach of taking charge getting the job done as was reminiscent of Lazenby's approach. I prefer THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS of the two that Dalton made, but LICENCE TO KILL is a much better film than first realized and it requires a closer look. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL truly comprise the end of one era as we see many of the filmmakers on those two films end their involvement with the series.

For me, GoldenEye and all the subsequent films up to and including SKYFALL have a different feel and look about them. Of the Pirece Brosnan/Daniel Craig era Bond films I gravitate towards TOMORROW NEVER DIES and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of QUANTUM OF SOLACE.

When I think of the James Bond series certain things or people come to a nostalgic mind. The music of John Barry, the sets of Ken Adam, Maurice Binder's gun barrel opening and the indelible image of Sean Connery are endearing to me.",1414886400,,4617,4.5
