341814,4,6301352181,"The first of this series is perhaps more original in its characters, but actually is a kind of cold soup serving of the sets and contraptions  the Flying Wing/ 1937 Stealth Bomber. its secret hanger/ the various boats and boat chases/ other ultra modern air craft) which originated in Republic's pioneering serial FIGHTING DEVIL DOGS all used in all four Dick Tracy Serials I personally like the second in the series because of its heavies.. criminal Pa Stark and his five sons, all familiar regulars like Jack Ingram, Pa himself being Charles Middleton, alias 39013 of Daredevils of the Red Circle. Lynn Roberts is the perfect secretary and one of the lovliest screen heroines of the period. The big brass and brains at Republic were sadly mistaken if they thought 5th and 6th graders would never think about relationships. I personally wondered how Dick Tracy could keep his hands off her. Lynn Roberts personal life is quite interesting. Ask the Web. These serials are a fun trip for car lovers, featuring the assembly line Fords and Dodges and along with the ""bootlegger specials"" of the late 30s. The Rod Cameron serials feature rare scenes of early 40s DeSotos and convertible Mercurys. But RETURN contains more variety in its episodes and is better acted.than the others. My DVD is from the Serial Bowl people and is excellent in sound and clarity, In the Dick Tracy srials, Devildogs, and SOSCoast Guard, you will see uses of the same places and sceney, a 30s glimpse of SF and LA areas. I learned to appreciate my own West Virginia part of the great Ohio Valley which is  much more beautiful.",1317340800,,1601,4.797101449275362

Republic Pictures was undoubtedly KING OF THE ""B"" movies in it's heyday, and this DICK TRACY RETURNS is one of 4 TRACY serials that little studio produced. The first TRACY serial was such a hit, sequels had to come. Tracy's 2 - 4 were each better than their previous cliffhangers. Something of a feat considering how sequels run.  But this one is terrific fun, and it was directed, as the last 2 are, by Republic's action aces William Witney and John English. Plots are tightly woven together, and the action is non-stop and furious.  Ralph Byrd actually became DICK TRACY to American's everywhere.  He was later on to repeat the role in an early TV series adaptaton and in 2 other non-Republic movie productions.  Don't miss any of these TRACY serials.  Great fun.",1308096000,,919,5.575539568345324

It starred Lynn Roberts, Charles Middleton, Jerry Tucker, David Sharpe and Ned Glass, was directed by William Witney and John English, and was photographed by William Nobles.",1248307200,,479,5.141025641025641
341817,4,6301352181,"I did miss there not being more quirky characters as those in the first serial. However, Charles Middleton can't be surpassed as a villain and the final confrontation in the last chapter is classic.  I also especially enjoyed, in the next to last chapter, Gwen's enjoyment of having spotted something suspicious about the blond floozy which even Tracy missed...and the laughingly unexpected scene afterwards with Tracy and the blond walking down the street. There's loads of typical L.A. area scenery in this with the look at the area as it was in the late 30's.  And of course lots of action.  Serial afficianados will love this one, although I don't think it quite came up to the original which had both quirky characters and gimmicks like the flying wing.",1240099200,,758,4.8604651162790695

341819,5,6301352181,So glad to get a fine print of this Republic serial. Max Collins introduces the film and since he wrote the Dick Tracy comic strip what a fitting tribute. Ironically Dave Sharpe only acts in the film and I saw little evidence of his incomperable stunt work. Of course Ralph Byrd does look more at ease with the character and Charles Middleton does another admirable job. VCI is to be commended on searching and finding good prints of old films thought lost in the caverns of public domain. I am anxiously awaiting the completion of the Republic cannon of Dick Tracy movies.,1220918400,3,573,4.627450980392157
341820,4,6301352181,"I am a fan of the four Dick Tracy serials and bought each of them on VHS when they where first released, the final three serials by VCI.  I was very happy to see they finally got around to releasing this one, so why the but.  I had bought the first serial again when it was brought out on DVD, I chose to buy the version released by Marengo Films and was glad I did.  They used a superior print and gave us a near flawless copy.  Unfortunately VCI did not do the same here.  It could well be they used the best print available to them, but there must be other copies out there they could have used to fix the main flaw which is several scenes being washed out to a white screen.  Perhaps this was the best they could do as I did not notice any of the broken film frames that I recall where present in the VHS release.  I encourage you to buy this if you enjoy the old movie serials and especially the old Dick Tracy's.  Good sales will encourage them to release the many serials they still have in their vaults.  All of these have long since past into the public domain, so if they won't hopefully some other studio will.",1215648000,10,1121,4.105504587155964

7813466,4,6301352181,"Dick Tracy Returns, 1938 film

Chester Gould wrote the Dick Tracy comic strip for the Chicago Tribune, it was very popular with both young and old. Movie serials were shown each week in theaters to encourage weekly attendance. Republic Pictures produced these and others; they were famous for their many Westerns. These were called cliffhangers as their activities enticed the audience to return. How do these action stories compare to todays dramas on TV and in the movies? This is the second of the four serials produced before WW II. It uses real events in its stories, such as the 200-inch telescope lens in the Palomar Observatory fabricated in Corning NY. Would a manufacturer deal with a criminal gang and a foreign spy? This has more action than the previous serial. Most episodes repeat a few minutes from an earlier episode, which adds to the length of this movie.

Dick Tracy is at war with the criminal Stark Gang, composed of relatives like the James-Younger Gang. In the late 19th century Los Angeles had the highest crime rate in the country. City officials colluded with both millionaires and organized crime; read a history book. The novels of Raymond Chandler and Erle Stanley Gardner were set in this era of Los Angeles. Note the things that are obsolete: steam locomotives, vertical car windshields, fabric roofed automobiles, dirt roads, cars with running boards, open cockpit airplanes, owner-operated stores, etc. Revolvers seem to have an unlimited amount of ammunition, no reloading required. Do todays villains still have foreign names? The right to keep and bear arms was not restricted in California (in this movie).

01. The Sky Wreckers. G-Men are being trained, they will learn from experience with criminals. Pa Stark has five sons, they plan a hold-up that hijacks a money truck. Bags are unloaded, did they leave a live witness? Will a false radio beam cause an airliner accident?
02. The Runway of Death. Tracy flies an airplane to warn the airliner. The Stark gang disguises a car. Tracy catches them but they knock him out.
03. Handcuffed to Doom. Tracy is put in a car and pushed down a ramp. He survives and finds other G-Men to recover the loot. The Stark Gang escaped. A blank note leaves a clue. Baron Kruger wants a military secret.

04. Four Seconds to Live. A train collision is averted. An extortion note is tested for fingerprints. We want cash! The Stark Gang is prevented from destroying that 200-inch observatory lens.
05. Death in the Air. The Stark Gang escapes in an airplane. Tracy follows in another to find them. But a test airplane crashed! Sabotage? There is another test flight.
06. Stolen Secrets. The lack of oxygen causes Tracy to pass out, then the pilot flips him out! There is a plan to steal an important aircraft engine, a tracking device will be used. A fuse sets off dynamite!
07. Tower of Death. Can Tracy be saved? Can they learn what the villains plan. They must find the aircraft motors before they are put on a ship and taken away? Shooting says something is wrong. A truck causes a tall tower to fall.

08. Cargo Destruction. The Stark Gang must raise cash. Tracy follows the truck, there is a fight. There is a fight in the truck. No brakes! There is an explosion by the dam.
09. The Clock of Doom. Tracy warns the people down in the valley of the burst dam. Newsreel photos show a flood. There is an assassination plot against Tracy; it fails.
10. High Voltage! Junior returned the briefcase1 There is a new welding method to build battleships. It can also cut into a steel vault. Who would steal it? The usage meters at the Municipal Power Plant will show increased usage.
11. The Missing Witness. The power meters show the location of heavy usage and the gang. Hands Up! There is another fight, the gang escapes. One is wounded, will he talk? There is a car chase and a shooting; then a crash.

12. The Runaway Torpedo. Tracy survived the car crash. They show a television set and a speedboat. Two men hijack that torpedo boat. Poison gas was a big threat then. There is another fight on the dock!
13. Passengers to Doom. There is a recapitulation of the story. The gang got away. A patient in the hospital talks to Tracy. Gone. Tracy jumps into a speedboat to stop the bad guys.
14. In the Hands of the Enemy. A young woman asks Tracy for help. Does it smell right? Tracy makes a wrong step. Two agents arrive to help. There is a trick! Junior is captured and offered in trade for Tracy. Junior overhears the plot, can he warn the G-Men in time?
15. G-Mens Drag-Net. Things don't work as planned for Stark. The car description is broadcast, a citizen call it in. G-Men arrive, Stark won't surrender. Shooting begins, dump trucks shield the G-Men. Stark has one last trick to escape by airplane; so too Tracy. After the Stark Gang was wiped out Tracy gets a promotion.

7813474,5,6301352181,"""Dick Tracy Returns"" is the second of four Dick Tracy serials from Republic Pictures, released in 1938, and the first of these directed by William Witney and John English.

This time Tracy is after a crime family, Pa Stark (Charles Middleton) and his five sons, Champ, Trigger, Dude, The Kid and Slasher (John Merton, Raphael Bennett, Jack Roberts, Ned Glass and Jack Ingram).  Dick Tracy returns to his office with a new agent, Ron Merton (David Sharpe) who, on his first assignment guarding a shipment of half a million dollars is killed by The Kid.  But The Kid, trying to get away in a taxi, is arrested by Tracy, and the battle with the Stark family heats up.

The story is more-conventional than those of the other three Dick Tracy serials, involving less of the ""science fiction"" element, though it includes an odd form of Television where a camera is not required.  Ralph Byrd returns in his best-known role, still as an FBI agent, with a different cast but the same assistants from the first serial, Gwen (Lynn Roberts), Steve Lockwood (Michael Kent), Junior (Jerry Tucker) and Mike McGurk (Lee Ford).  The plot follows the pattern of the other Dick Tracy serials, where each chapter deals with a specific crime, tied together by pursuit of the Starks.  The slapstick comedy of Junior and Mike McGurk is not handled as well as it was in the earlier serial, but there is less of it, with McGurk played as a more-useful assistant.  Less time is spent on ""atmosphere"" and the chapters are shorter, one under 15 minutes, with two of them ""retrospective"" having reruns from the first two chapters.  Still, the plot holds together well, with Charles Middleton in fine form and helped especially by John Merton as ""Champ"" Stark.

VCI's edition on DVD, # 8503, is on two discs, which allows space for some extra features.  The image during the chapters is razor-sharp from corner to corner, likely from a 35mm print.  Some of the chapter recap text is not as crisp, possibly from another source print, but quite adequate for the purpose.  Each chapter is preceeded by a notice with the MPPDA certificate number, though a couple of these are out of sequence, possibly attached to the wrong chapters, and one number is used twice.  While the titles are very clean, the chapters themselves show a few signs of wear, occasional sideways shifts and odd single-frame defects.  Chapter Five has some fading on the right edge of the screen and a few places where the highlights tend to wash out, but these defects are fairly minor.  Most of the serial has good gray scale, looking a lot better than the old videotape edition, and the sound is crisp and clear, with little noise and low distortion.

The menu is straightforward, without some of the ""cuteness"" seen in other DVD's that slow down the selection process.  ""Extra"" features are not plentiful, but the video introduction by Max Allan Collins is informative.  It is attached to Chapter One, not individually selectable through the menu.  There are also three serial movie trailers on disc 2, for Universal's ""Junior G-Men of the Air"" (1942) and ""The Master Key"" (1945), and for Republic's ""Dick Tracy's G-Men"" of 1939.

All of the Dick Tracy serials are good, and while of them this is not my personal favorite, it has many virtues, enhanced by what VCI was able to do in restoring the print.  The sound quality is very good, and despite a few remaining flaws in the picture of some chapters, I believe by Amazon's criteria it fully deserves the 5-star ""I Love It"" rating.",1355875200,,3524,4.752052545155993
