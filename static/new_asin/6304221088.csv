Peter O'Toole is memorable as the mad Earl of Gurney who believes that he is Jesus Christ and when restored to  ""normalcy"" turns into Jack the Ripper.

Unfortunately for his conniving relatives, he's not of sound mind and body - he thinks he's Jesus Christ. In order for them to maintain their parasitical existence, there must be a legitimate heir somehow. They try two ways - hire a woman to marry him and get pregnant, and cure him.

813682,5,6304221088,"The DVD:

I bought The Criterion Collections  2001 release of The Ruling Class from Amazon US in 2012.  It plays on my Sony Blu-ray player and Sony HDTV in Australia.  Presumably this NTSC Region 0 DVD will also play on Region 2 equipment in UK and Europe.

The DVD case states that this is a New 16 x 9 widescreen digital transfer, supervised by director Peter Medek and restored to the original full-length version.

Ive timed this DVD and can confirm that it has a run time of 154 minutes (including both the introduction and final credits).

Although the DVD is described as being a digital transfer this does not necessarily mean that the film has actually been restored.  Rather, it appears to me that it has been remastered  that is, newly copied from an old print, the original negative or perhaps an intermediate positive.  There are occasional small white (and sometimes black) flecks on the screen but no scratches.

Those who have actually purchased The Criterion Collections DVD consider it to be the definitive release.

Amazon UK is also offering other releases in PAL format.  But, by all reports, these have poor picture and sound quality.  One is in 4x3 format and another has been cut by about half-an-hour.

The Film:

The Ruling Class was first a theatre production and then a film.  With the transition the producers incorporated many external scenes  perhaps intending to enhance the theatre experience by moving beyond the proscenium.  But this wasn't always really necessary  for example, the duel between Lord Gurney and the psychiatrist starts in the hall and then moves to the rooftop for no apparent reason other than that it could be filmed.

Some reviewers  and perhaps cinema audiences  were surprised by the sudden musical inserts.  These are funny enough in the film but would have been hilarious on the stage.  The Earl of Gurney and the Master in Lunacy bursting into the Eton Boating Song is just as believable in the film as it would have been on the stage.  Other inserts, however, although very funny, are more difficult to accept in a film than in a theatre production.

There are a few shots  added by way of exposition perhaps  which are gratuitous: the two Old Etonians in a rowing-boat on the river; the House of Lords filled with mannequins covered in cobwebs; and Jack the Ripper in a nineteenth-century street.",1407283200,,2358,4.8104738154613464

813685,5,6304221088,"After giving a rousing speech praising the British upper class for creating ""the greatest empire the world has ever known,"" the 13th Earl of Gurney goes home, dons his Royal Guards uniform - and a ballet tutu - and promptly hangs himself with a silken rope...

...Thus creating an awkward gap in the Gurney family lineage, which dates back to Medieval times. The problem being that the legal heir to the estate is the 'eccentric' Jack Gurney (O'Toole), an upper crust drool-case who returns home from the asylum to assume his familial duties dressed as Jesus Christ.

Jack's chief outward symptom of mental illness is his unshakable belief that he is, in fact, God. He is quite certain of this. When asked why he believes he is God, Jack replies matter-of-factly with one of the great lines ever penned: ""Because, Madam, I found that whenever I prayed, I was simply talking to myself!""

From there the movie evolves from a light amusing farce into a fascinating psychological & metaphysical allegory in which Jack is forced to face the truth in a titanic clash of egos of Biblical proportions, after which he is ostensibly 'cured,' and the movie pivots yet again into a stark, surreal, nightmarish finale, in which Jack discovers his true identity and ascends to his 'rightful' place as a member of the ruling class.

The Ruling Class is one of the darkest, most vitriolic comedies ever made; a scathing tour de force of savage wit & acid irony, by turns subtle & brutal, horrific & hilarious; a brilliant satirical masterpiece that defies description or categorization, which must be seen to be appreciated, and is not soon forgotten.",1402963200,,1635,4.849462365591398
813816,4,6304221088,"Have wanted this movie for years -- a prime example of dark, satiric British humor.  O'Toole's wooing of his lady by acting as a bird is unforgettable, as are the performances of many of the other major actors.",1402444800,,210,4.526315789473684

He climbs on it and puts his arms in the statue arms like when Jesus was nailed to a cross.,1397347200,,380,3.8227848101265822
813818,5,6304221088,"When I was halfway through writing this article, actor Peter OToole passed away. He serves as yet another example of just how pointless, asinine, vapid, and meaningless the Academy Awards are. Rightfully nominated a zillion times, OToole is in the fine company of such Academy Award losers as Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Richard Burton, Alfred Hitchcock, and Stanley Kubrick. The Academy did eventually give OToole its condescending honorary Oscar, as it did to Chaplin, but thats a mere smokescreen to mask their own artlessness.

OTooles performances ranged from great to quirky and interesting in films like Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Beckett (1964), Lord Jim (1965), Night of the Generals (1967), The Lion in Winter (1967), Goodbye Mr. Chips (1969), Murphys War (1971), The Ruling Class (1972), Man Friday (1975), Zulu Dawn (1979), The Stunt Man (1980), Masada (1981), My Favorite Year (1982), The Last Emperor (1987), and Venus (2006).  Naturally, as prolific as he was, he had his share of embarrassing bombs: Caligula (1979), Supergirl (1984), and, most of all, Thomas Kinkades Christmas Cottage (2008). His last film is the soon to be released Katherine of Alexandria (2014).

The Ruling Class was, almost immediately, a cult hit. It earned OToole yet another Oscar nomination, but he lost out to Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972). Although The Godfather is a better film and Brandos performance was superb, I would stand with a tiny minority in arguing that OToole should have won.

The Ruling Class is certainly one of OTooles weirdest films, thus earning its cult reputation. He plays Jack, the 14th Earl of Gurney. Jack goes by J.C. because he believes himself to be none other than Jesus Christ. Jacks daddy, the 13th Earl (Harry Andrews), pulls an Albert Dekker and hangs himself in a tutu. Paranoid schizo Jack shows up to run the estate in daddys place. Jack has had a life-size cross conveniently built in the castle where he can love everyone from the bottom of my soul to the tip of my penis.

Peter Medak directed from Peter Barnes play and, with Peter O Toole starring, there is a lot of phallic symbolism afoot. Naturally, being a British movie of the 70s, there is plenty of other symbolism being bandied about as well, including a battle of misfit deities, an assault by an ape in a top hat, Ebenezer Scrooge as a phlegmatic bishop (Alastair Sim), a drunkard leftist butler (Arthur Lowe), a usurping by the Electric Messiah (Nigel Green), and Jacks miraculous born again transformative cure from Jesus Christ (the God Of Love) to Jack the Ripper (the God of Wrath and Vengeance). Societys acceptance of Jack as the serial-killing deity, as opposed to its rejection of Jack as pacifist god, is about as subtle as it sounds.

Like many British films of the period, The Ruling Class is imbued with psychedelic surrealism. What sets it apart from films like The Magic Christian (1969) is its theatrical ensemble, topped by a bouncing-off-the-walls performance by  OToole. Even with the superb cast of Sims and Lowe, O Toole walks easily away with the film. Other than T.E Lawrence, J.C. may be his best performance.

The movie is inevitably (and deliriously) dated, with its psychedelic first half giving way to Clockwork Orange territory in the second half. The Ruling Class stage origins are keenly felt, and the vaudevillian musical numbers add to the lunacy of this genre-proof film. Medaks direction is acidic and idiosyncratic. He handles blasphemy in the best theater of the absurd type of way. How does flower child J.C. know he is God? When I pray, I find I am talking to myself.

The Criterion Collection debatably erred in restoring 20 excised minutes to the film, making The Ruling Class excessive, but perhaps even more bizarre, in its 154 minute version. Apart from that, there is the usual exemplary Criterion extras, including home movies supplied by Medak, excellent commentary tracks, photo galleries, and a beautifully remastered, digital print.

813819,4,6304221088,"What do you do with Jack, a rich nut job who thinks he's God (or Jesus, sometimes)?  Well, the audience can enjoy him to the hilt, as his behavior is delightfully unpredictable (in one scene he hangs from across, apparently while meditating).  His uptight, aristocratic relatives plot to have him committed to a mental ward, after they marry him off (to his uncle's trolloppy mistress) and he fathers a child so the family line can continue, while his scheming uncle takes over the estate.  The plot doesn't go quite as planned, and somewhere along the way he gets cured (a very funny scene), and the new ""sane"" Jack seems quite capable of running the estate by himself and taking his place as a proper establishment figure in the UK's House of Lords.  Peter O'Toole in effect plays two vastly different characters, though both are capable of breaking into song at odds moments (my favorite is where he leads a group of fox-hunters in singing ""Dem Bones, Dem Bones, Dem Dry Bones"").  No one in the cast seems 100 percent sane (the butler is a lovable little cuss), and much of the fun comes from these oddballs playing out the story in a posh British manor house.  It's not for all tastes, and there's a smattering of violence (off-screen, mostly) that is kind of jarring, but if you like Brit-wit, this is a fun ride. Most amusing is watching Jack's conniving uncle grow continually frustrated as his plan unravels.  Also, a psychiatrist brought in to help Jack ends up cracking up himself.

Under the surface, the movie is kind of a cryptic tribute to the 1960s youth culture - longhaired sex-loving peaceniks are freaky, but nice, but the old stuffed-shirt button-down older generation is uptight, hypocritical, and money-fixated. The one clergyman in the movie is a doddering old fool (played by Alistair Sim, great at doddering) who gets an energy jolt from seeing the ""new"" Jack (shorthaired and pro-establishment) take a firm stand against free sex and tough on crime.  No wonder this was loved by the few flower people who managed to see it when it was released.  Longhaired Jack is goofy but lovable - the new Jack is prone to violence (but I won't spoil the ending).

To conclude, I have to share this anecdote: I first saw this at the Vanderbilt University cinema (this was pre-VCR, pre-DVD, etc), and the VU cinema had very few blacks in most audiences, and certainly not for a movie like this. (Don't get mad yet, let me finish.)  Just as the movie started, a 30ish black couple sat down in our aisle, but left after about 15 minutes, shaking their heads.  On the way out, I looked at the description of the movie in the cinema flyer: ""An uproarious black comedy.""  That explained everything, and made me laugh.",1392508800,3,2724,4.695378151260504

813942,3,6304221088,"This used to be a well known ""cult"" film but seems to have disappeared from cult film lists in the past fifteen years.  I've heard about this one for years and have just now got to see it, thanks to Criterion.  It states clearly on the box that this is a movie that stands by itself and that is a very true statement.  I cannot think of any other film like it.  What everyone remembers about this film is how the characters just spurt into song and dance when you least expect it, even in mid-dialogue.  It is fun and very disconcerting, especially when it happens during a serious scene. It gives the film an almost anarchist feel.

The other thing that everyone remembers is...Peter O'Toole.  Movie lovers just love Peter O'Toole when he's on his game.  But I'm going to break with many of the other reviewers.  I don't consider this to be one of his best performances.  He is very aristocratic looking and is very good at playing someone who thinks he's Jack the Ripper (as he does in the final quarter of the film).  But, as someone who thinks he's Jesus Christ (which Jack does throughout most of the film), Peter is a bit limited.  His brooding style of acting doesn't really compliment one who is supposed to be gentle and loving.  Peter O'Toole needs a character who has inner conflict and inner demons in order to shine.  Jesus is just not a good fit for him.  Disagree with me?  Think of Richard Harris in the role.  He has a gentler voice and is more comfortable with long hair.  Peter doesn't look comfortable in long hair and a beard and, to my ear, in many scenes comes across as just reciting dialogue.

I had a lot of problems with this film.  It's based on a play and could have used a couple of more rewrites.  Several scenes feel stagey and some of the comedic relief should have been left out.  What works on stage doesn't necessarily work on the screen.  One scene in particular; the wedding scene, just does not work.  I can see this working on a stage with the actors being guided by the reaction of the audience. But, here...I just found it unfunny, forced,and painful.  There are several scenes that don't seem to exist for any purpose except to cater to a live audience that is not there.

Despite all the song and comedy, the film get very dark towards the end.  More dark than you've been led to expect.  The last half hour of the movie almost slaps your face with darkness.

But, despite all its faults, and I think there are many, the theme of the movie stays with you and makes you ponder.  The wealthy and privileged look after their own. And, our society is more comfortable with psychopaths than those who preach a gospel of love.  You walk away knowing deep down that that is probably true.

Someone needs to remake this film and have it take place in America and have characters part of the much vaunted 'one percent'.  The themes of The Ruling Class are as timely as ever.",1368489600,,2909,4.418079096045198

813944,5,6304221088,"I've browsed the previous reviews and come away saddened.  So many people who can't find a redeeming feature in this great movie.  That is my point of view, and if you don't like it read the others.

Perhaps some of the others are Anglophiles.  If that is their sad condition, there is little to be done for them.  If you don't know the meaning of the root words, you may consider me an Anglophobe.  I do not, however, fear the British, I simply have no use for their system of social controls.  Why this film is so good in my opinion.  It is long, yes, it is expensive, yes, it is old, yes (though not so old as I) but you can spend your money and time on lesser films and miss a good show.

The story opens with the Earl of Somewhere crossdressing, and accidentally hanging himself.  A problem for his very staid family and the local bishop who think the Earl should leave his estate to either the church or th unctious family members.  Instead he leaves it to his insane son who thinks himself Jesus Christ.  The crazy one knows enough to know that Christ is honored by the masses and considred insant through the ages because he teaches LOVE.

Many plots are devised to rid the world of the crazy son who is now an earl and a member of the House of Lords not because of talent or worth but because of an accident of birth--the British logic here is clearly shown in the movie.

Fun, not gentle fun, is made of the system and social mores of the Great Empire as the lunatic kills his aunt, frames the communist butler, and serves in the House of Lords, his rightful place, dispensing his insanity to the otherwise insane members.

If you, like me, do not care for the British system, see the church as the Great Inquisitor of Dostoyevsky, lean toward socialism, you will enjoy this movie.  If not, you can add your voice to the many others who reviewed it.",1284076800,3,1859,4.329479768786127

It begins as a delightful story of a madman, but greedy, upper-class individuals get the upper hand, turning the story darker and darker. They have to take a wonderful ""madman"" who thinks he is God/Jesus and brainwash him into thinking he is simply Jack, who is headed for Parliamentary leadership in the UK. What they unleash is terrifying and far too real in society today. I'm a published author of horror fiction (2 collections & contributor to many anthologies), and I guarantee the final scene in this film will scare the hell out of any intelligent viewer. Horripilations all over!

The acting is fantastic, particularly O'Toole's and Coral Browne's (late wife of the late Vincent Price) acting are outstanding! Criterion has done the world a great favor in putting this film in such a fine package.

It is a long film (154 min.), but it is definitely worth seeing and owning!",1282953600,7,1121,4.768041237113402
813946,4,6304221088,"It goes a tad overboard, but overall I really enjoyed this film.  I mean, I could pick it apart, and technically it has a few major flaws, but picking at it seems almost unnecessary since it offers so much enjoyment.

I'll try and get the hate out of the way right away.

My biggest complaint, and maybe my only one, has to do with the script.  That's a big complaint, I know, since the script is what holds the film together.  This films tone, for me, is flawless.  It comes across like a Mel Brooks musical, complete with biblical satire that calls to mind the humor that made something like `Monty Python' such a cult favorite.  So, as you can see it is not the tone of the film that I have an issue with.  For me, the film actually rides along rather flawlessly until the third quarter when everything kind of takes a nose dive.  I found the `battle of the gods' scene to be over-the-top, even for the nature of the film.  After that, when Jack is apparently cured, I found his sudden shift to `Jack the Ripper' territory to be a big hard to swallow.  It just seemed to derail the focus of the film for me.

Still, with that hanging over its head for me I still find this film to be a laugh riot well worth anyone's time and attention.

The biggest reason for that is the fantastic performances, the best of which comes from Peter O'Toole.  O'Toole is largely considered one of the best actors of all time (where is his Oscar?), but I am not one who is often taken by him.  This has to be his finest performances and easily one of the best comedic performances I've ever seen.  He completely nails the films tone, understanding the social satire at play and using it to his advantage.  The way he speaks each word, using wit and a delicate layer of earnestness helps create the complete picture for us, allowing us to understand his mental state without being distracted from his personality.  He even nails the films third act, making the best of the uneven tonal shift, layering his character with enough humor to make the devilish turn completely appropriate.  The rest of the cast, especially Alastair Sim, Arthur Lowe and William Mervyn, are all top notch and utterly fantastic.

Certainly one of my favorite ensembles of the 70's.

The imagery here, the memorable sequences (the outlandish dance sequences and the hilarious `cross napping') help make this a must see film; a satire that shows originality.  Sure, it may offend some (biblical satires are always controversial) but if you have an open mind and understand where this film is coming from then you should be able to sink right into this `blessed' event.

I love `The Godfather' and I love Marlon Brando in it, but I personally feel that Peter O'Toole was the best male performance of 1972; hands down.",1275004800,7,2773,4.535211267605634
813947,2,6304221088,"This movie doesn't know what it's own genre is. It's a silly romp for over 2 hours, then suddenly becomes a dark comedy.

If it weren't for Alistair Sim's brilliance, I'd have turned this off several times. Every scene with Sim is magical and original.

Putting aside all the weird 70s crumminess, it's hard to warm up to characters with awful wigs spewing Shakespearean-like nonsense from the get-go. We don't even meet our ""beloved"" lead character until about 25 minutes into the ""story.""

The murder that happens is not only out of place in this film, but it's AFTER the entire movie should end! It should climax & paste ""THE END"" on the screen about 10 minutes before it turns murderous.

If you like psychedelic 70s nonsense & over-the-top performances by great actors stooping to unfunny stupidity, you'll love this. I love Peter O'Toole, but not in this. I'd rather watch him for 4 hours in Lawrence of Arabia than for even 1 hour in this thing.",1269043200,4,952,4.682634730538922
813948,4,6304221088,"Back in 2001, The Criterion Collection saw fit to add ""The Ruling Class"" (1972) to their catalog; which means there is now a good print available in the correct aspect ratio, one that includes the entire original release running time of 154 minutes. It also means that ""The Ruling Class"" is now regarded in film circles as a ""significant"" movie. Of course almost any film student will tell you that ""significant"" is not necessarily synonymous with entertaining, critically acclaimed, or well-made.

  So if you are considering a purchase or have just had a confused post-purchase viewing experience the following discussion may prove useful. This is a British film, one I originally watched on the BBC a few months after its release. It was neither a critical success (mixed reviews) nor a box office sensation and hitting the BBC so soon after a theatrical release back then was not much different from going direct-to-video today.

  It was a counter-culture film, and much of my original enjoyment came from the obvious tweaking of certain cultural and political institutions. Much of this stuff has lost its power and appeal over the years.

  It has a lot of expressionistic and allegorical elements; this sort of stuff was (and is) relatively rare in an English language film and probably accounts for much of the current cult status of the film. The black comedy aspect of these elements has held up very well and you will understand the film better and enjoy it more if you don't take it literally.

  Jack, the 14th Earl of Gurney (Peter O'Toole), has recently inherited the family title and a place in the House of Lords of the British Parliament. The story actually begins with a cheerfully provocative black comedy sequence as his father, the 13th Earl (Harry Andrews), accidentally hangs himself while performing what is apparently a long-standing self-pleasuring ritual.

  Jack believes himself Jesus Christ and his family believes that they can get their hands on the estate once he produces an heir. Their idea being to have him committed and then become guardians of the child. Carolyn Seymour plays his uncle's mistress who is brought in to marry Jack. Her character throws a wrench in the works by falling in love with her new husband. Other than Jack, Seymour's character is the only one that undergoes any real change during the course of the film and she sells this transformation quite nicely while also providing one of the best striptease sequences you are likely to stumble across in a mainstream movie.

  As already noted the running length is 154 minutes, that's about the length of two movies and if the film were being produced today I suspect that it would be done as two separate films. Indeed it is really two stories with each having an entirely different tone. About midway through the film, the Jesus version of the 14th Earl is replaced by a Jack the Ripper version. In the process a farcical and relatively light-hearted black comedy is instantly transformed into a much darker story. Black comedy gives way to dark fantasy and hallucinations as the wheels fall off the story until a visually stunning ending.

  The 1972 theme was that being forced to conform to the ritualistic practices of upper class British society produces a monster. Not being able to ""do your own thing"" unleashes a monster on the world. Unfortunately the basic cause and effect of this whole process is glossed over and one is left wondering why the film you have been watching has been replaced with something entirely different and far less entertaining.

  O'Toole underplays his two characters, don't expect a lot of Gary Oldham type excess. Jesus is more a mild narcissist than a booming holy roller. Jack (the Ripper) is much better mannered but obviously smoldering beneath his polite exterior.

  The laughs mostly come from the discomfort of Jack's family and from Alastair Sim's apoplectic bishop and Authur Lowe's collectivist butler who abuses the family with a ""Benson"" type frankness.

  There are two great musical sequences, a hunt club performance of ""Dem Bones"" (a homage to ""The Prisoner"") and the climatic scene in the House of Lords (a surreal montage of decay to the music of ""Pomp and Circumstances"" and ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"").

  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1262044800,4,4322,4.933609958506224
813949,4,6304221088,"It must be over twenty years since I first saw this film and I really wanted to see it again. The only way to do that was to buy it, which is probably true for anybody who wants to see this now. Is that a good reason to buy it? Well, no, not exactly. This film is a fairly blunt satire on the British ruling class which has implications for ruling classes everywhere. It's not often laugh out loud funny mainly because there are elements of self-consciousness which prevent you from losing yourself in the way you might in something sillier. What was always interesting about this film was the main character's transformation from what Americans might call a liberal(and others might call a socialist) to and extreme reactionary. The film allows us to believe that this is due to his lordship's mental state - he's not all there upstairs. But I remember when I first saw it I saw parallels to people of my generation who started out as peace and love hippies and became captains of industry and conservative politicians. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck to some extent by it's relative tameness. If it had been made today I suspect it would have been armed with a sharper sword. Just the same it is what is often referred to these days as wacky - song and dance routines suddenly occur in an otherwise straight production. They are hilarious and inovative for their time. Peter O'Toole gives what is probably his second best performance after Lawrence, although anyone who missed his recent performance in Dean Spanley missed a masterly performance. There are quite unforgetable performances from a wonderfully sardonic and sly Coral Browne and an impish Arthur Lowe. It is always wonderful to see Alastair Sim in anything but he is a little cliched and Michael Bryant's Dr. Herder is a little undercooked for my taste. I have seen this film described as flawed but I think it is of it's time - somewhat measured by contemporary standards. I have given it four stars because it isn't perfect but really it's a love/hate thing. Some people will love it. I do. I should mention this is the full length version and therefore makes more sense than the edited version.

It's a rather sad state of affairs that virtually every movie reviewed on Amazon with any fame or notoriety is reviewed as 'excellent', 'genius', 'brilliant', insert superlative, etc.

The fact is, and most of us know this, most of the movies sold here or anywhere are mediocre at best. If you don't believe me, just go look at the reviews for either version of the Poseidon Adventure.

However I can honestly say this movie is not a mediocre movie at all. It's truly terrible. One of the very worst movies I ever had the misfortune to view.
But let me take you through the typical critic-bait scenario, just in case you're unfamiliar with the plot...

This movie is brilliant. It's brilliant comedy. If you don't think so, it's because you're not smart enough. Movies that make fun of society are funny. Why? Because society is so corrupt/venal/hypocritical/ignorant(insert calumny here) that they deserve to be made fun of. Scorn and Mirth are the same thing, aren't they? If you like watching women adore the husbands who strangle them to death then you're in the club, if you don't it's because you're not smart enough. (Are you picking up on the pattern yet?) Anyway, every smart person knows that if you can point out how ridiculous the people you hate are, you don't need to bother further with things like plot, coherency, actual humor or for that matter (gasp) sobriety. This is the Seventies, after all.

Because you see we enjoy seeing madness, cruelty, death and sexual perversion without any rhyme or reason. Why? Because it's funny! It shows how idiotic people really are! What's that? What do you mean 'why not suggest a solution instead of mindlessly ridiculing people we think are inferior to us?' Don't you get it? It's a COMEDY! What's that you say? 'Comedy and Ridicule are not the same thing? Why not try to actually be funny?' You really don't get it do you..?

For the record, Peter O'Toole is my very favorite actor. The only reason I sat through this movie the one time was because of him. If society is really as stupid and pathetic as this brain-sludge of a script actually suggests, there's certainly no purpose in pointing it out, and if it isn't, well, maybe there are more constructive approaches to the problem of societies ills. As far as Peter goes, I'm quite certain based on his biography he wasn't sober at any time before, during or after the making of this movie. But that's the point. People might think this way when they're stoned or drunk. They might even enjoy watching it, or at least boasting that they've seen it and like it. But people who really honestly think society is this bad cold and sober don't make movies about it, they get a gun, go to a public place and kill as many people as they can, themselves included. So in the end I have to say, all critical criterion given its due, psychopathy is overrated.",1238889600,7,2881,4.650294695481336
814120,4,6304221088,"I own this older version of the film. The soundtrack quality is very muddy (hum and too much low/bottom), which makes hearing the thick British accents difficult to decipher.

814121,1,6304221088,"Peter O' Toole's binge drinking (or occasional bouts of momentary sobriety) from the  days when this film was made explains a lot about why he took on the role of a mad English Lord in the allegedly funny dark comedy The Ruling Class, although how Arthur Lowe was talked into coming aboard this brain-hurting turkey is a mystery.

In a nutshell, this perhaps one-time avant-garde movie from 1972 plays out like this... A fusty old nobleman, the thirteenth Earl of Gurney, played by Harry Andrews, is secretly an asphyxiphiliac who gets his jollies by having his manservant hang him (as in by the neck) from a bedpost every night, only to step in and rescue him just before he permanently blacks out. Well, the equally antique servant one night keels over of a heart attack right in the middle of one of His Lordship's bizarre and unfunny sessions of pleasure-via-strangulation, and the poor old chap dangles his way kicking and gasping to that great country house party in the sky.

Enter the Lord's heir, Jack, a certifiably insane Mod-ist with terrible fashion sense who goes through life under the delusion that he is none other than (gee, who didn't see this coming?) Jesus Christ incarnate. Scenes of loud, irritatingly madcap British ""humor"" pass and along the line the new Lord marries a stripper whose primary ambition is to have the salesgirls at Harrod's step-to for her now that she is a Lady. Meanwhile Lord Jack refuses to answer to anything other than ""Jesus"" or ""JC"" and the staff and family retainers are thrown into a tizzy. Various efforts are taken to cure the new Lord and make him an acceptable representative of the stogy old-line Tory Gurney family, and finally all seems well at the end when the Lord begins to answer to the name ""Jack"". Jack becomes a fire-breathing conservative complete with calls in his House of Lord's maiden speech for a return to capital punishment and the general exploitation of a rightfully downtrodden working class.  Little do his peers know, however, that while cured of his delusions about being Jesus, the fourteenth Lord Gurney is not now answering to his own name of Jack, but he believes himself to that erroneously romanticized Victorian sexual misfit, Jack the Ripper. Yes, how hil-ar-i-ous, Lord Jack now a sexual murderer of women, uh-huh.

And that, Amazonians, is The Ruling Class for you, an agonizingly awful mislabeled classic.",1196985600,8,2395,4.889162561576355
814122,5,6304221088,"What a relief anyway to note that at least ONE reviewer below can write, both to the point and grammatically correctly! OK, on to the actual movie.

I'm slightly disappointed, but unsurprised, I suppose, not to see the following interpretation included among the many. I saw The Ruling Class when it first came out in the UK. Of course the film took well-aimed pot shots at a variety of British institutions, but also asked subtler questions of all of us, such as ""Shouldn't society review its approach to insanity?"" (and in fact, society did) ""Don't we pay mere lip-service to human kindness and fellowship, whilst deep-down we in fact respect only wealth and status, no matter how doubtfully gained?"" (no change there unfortunately) ""Shouldn't we scrutinise more carefully the risks of information without responsibility?"" (a good one, that, and rather relevant to today, wouldn't you say?). From my point of view, upon the Earl's psychological conversion by his parasitic family from open-hearted innocent to... socially-presentable 'something else', their inadvertent creation became a metaphor for the beast in all of us. The beast let loose because of human ignorance, fear, and contempt. A caricature, sure, highly exaggerated, certainly, but horribly valid all the same.

Oh, and by the way, I was utterly floored that although others in the ensemble won deserved praise at the time, Peter O'Toole's bravura performance was to a very great extent under-appreciated. I doubt whether it rankles with him today. But anyway, my hat's off to you, Peter. Always will be.",1194220800,10,1572,5.18503937007874

Yet I feel that it hasn't dated at all, that we will always have these stuffy upper class bastards (whether they are British, American, French, or what have you) with us.  Many have had problems with the mise-en-scene of the film, stating that it's too stagey because it's based on a play.  I didn't find this at all.  Peter Medak's direction is very good, and his compositions are quite good.  I recently saw a film called Butley, which was based on a play and was really boring cinematically (but was well written and acted).  This film doesn't feel like a filmed play at all.  The performances are all top notch, especially O'Toole and Arthur Lowe as the butler.  The film ranges from light farce to dark, dark humour.  It has a very English air about it, and that may not sit well with many viewers.  Much of English humour can be cruel, dark, heartless, and cynical, and this film has it in spades.  It doesn't always translate well to American audiences (or other audiences).  I think this film is an underrated masterpiece.  I was very happy when Criterion released the full, truly uncut version.  It was initially released in a 130 minute version, then later in an ""uncut"" 141 minute version (which obviously wasn't the full length version).  This cut is.

Yes, it's funny, but you will find yourself smiling between the jokes at the overall feeling that pervades. I'm not surprised by the few negative reviews by people who don't ""get it"" (they were not meant to). I am amazed that this was nominated for several Academy Awards.

814127,5,6304221088,"""The Ruling Class"" is the kind of sharp, intelligent, vicious satire that only the Brits can do this well.  It is by turns, curious, silly, dry, sharp and nasty as a cat's litter box. The plot twists are as crazy as the main character, and the movie's theme, ""the idle rich have a way of protecting themselves"" is as pertinent today as it was in 1972.  Indeed, this is the type of movie which could only be made in the 1970's, the last time when the authority structures and ""the ruling classes"" were regarded with general suspicion by the rest of society.

In a bravura performance which should have won him an Oscar, Peter O'Toole plays Jack Gurney, heir to an English earldom.  There's only one problem: Jack is in the looney bin because he thinks he's Jesus Christ.  The plot revolves around how the rest of Jack's relatives plan to ""cure"" him so he's just ""sane"" enough to inherit and then manipulate him to their own ends.  Needless to say, sly, cynical jokes about religious and social hypocrisy are abundant, and they're all right on the money.

Like the very best of British satires, the more you bring to this movie, the more rewards it holds.  A knowledge of Verdi operas, 19th Century French Romantic literature, English music hall traditions, and English public school songs will enhance one's enjoyment of this movie immeasurably, although none of it is necessary to appreciate the wit and silliness of what's going on here.  Alistair Sim, as the nervous, confused and senile archbishop is a gem throughout, a man whose conflicts are all too obvious because they're all too human.

Eventually, Jack is ""cured,"" and the change his personality undergoes is radical, to say the least.  To tip it off would be to give things away, but its rather remarkable what the filmakers have to say is a socially acceptable alternative to wanting to be Jesus Christ.

Watch out for the ending of this movie.  It's violent, vicious and totally uncompromising.  It's meant to repel the viewer and does so effectively.  Don't let that prevent you from enjoying the rest of all the brilliance and wit this film has in such abundance, however.  Yes, the scene in Parliament is over-long, overdone and the one flaw in the movie, but, that aside, this film will make laugh, make you cry, make you think and make you angry, all at the same time.  How many movies today can you think of that manage to do all that?",1128729600,35,2404,4.658767772511848
814128,3,6304221088,"OK, so it was made in 1972, but the 60s didn't really come to an end until at least 1973 or '74.  I remember seeing it when I was 19 years old and feeling appropriately dazed by the experience.  It was right up there with Ken Russell's THE DEVILS and Fellini's ROMA (and SATYRICON, which while released in 1969, I didn't see until '72)as one of my trippy movie favorites of the period.  I don't know how well I really understood any of those movies at the time, but I liked ""weird""--and I liked iconoclastic.  And these films all seemed to be pretty groundbreaking at the time.  I'm sure I fancied myself quite the young aesthete.

In recent years I've reviewed all of these movies except ROMA, and have a much more qualified view of them.  I don't deny their giddy power, and I still admire their experimentalism.  But I don't see them as masterpieces.  I would not dismiss them as period curios exactly either, but they were of a different era, and it shows.  At the time, it seemed to my untrained critical sensibility that we were on the verge of a new age of boldly experimental cinema.  Now I can't help see it as something of a (fascinating but not entirely successful) blip in cinema history.  It was, to be sure, a wild time.  And there was little time to reflect on all its attendant emotions in tranquility.

It has been argued that THE RULING CLASS takes on some easy targets.  With all the social upheaval of the 60s, it was hardly an original conceit to satirize British nobility.  The English upper classes have been poked fun at for centuries, of course, but screenwriter Peter Barnes (who also wrote the play on which this film is based) goes way beyond your usual social satire and into the realm of the utterly surreal.  It doesn't do to simply poke fun at the upper crust, not when there's a culture war raging outside the studio.  Making gentle fun of upper class eccentricities was not going to cut in 1965 (when the play was written).  Not when actual insanity was the order of the day.

The death of the ""eccentric"" 13th Earl of Gurnsey (Harry Andrews) and the ascendency of his certifiably insane son Jack (Peter O'Toole) to the title is reflective of the change in point of view.  The pater familias is dispatched early in the film, accidentally hanging himself while wearing a 19th century military jacket and a tutu.  Son Jack, who suffers from delusions that he is Jesus and has long been tucked away in an asylum, arrives to assume his father's title.  ""J.C."" (as he prefers to be called) is sincerely Christlike in his insanity.  And his Gospel of Love suggests not only Christianity in its purest form, but also the emerging hippie culture of the mid-60s (and significantly, its waning hold on the public imagination by the early 70s).

It may seem an obvious ploy now, but it is also emblematic of its era that J.C. is only once again declared sane when he abandons his Christ-like persona in favor of one much more sinister.  Of course, those around him cannot see that he has surrendered his identity as ""the God of Love"" in favor of that of a self-righteous, sexually repressed and calculated killer (a la Jack the Ripper).  And is there not a certain irony in the fact that in his new state of delusion, the ""prostitutes"" he now dispatches are in reality, members of the elite class (one by birth and one by marriage, interestingly enough)?  Barnes and director Peter Medak give the audience plenty to chew over.

But maybe it's because I'm older and wiser, or maybe more cinematically jaded, but looking back at the movie some 33 years on (as many years as the actual Christ was on the planet, we're told), it doesn't seem to be quite enough.  For those of us Yanks who became kiddie Anglophiles because of the Beatles, THE AVENGERS and Carnaby Street, this certainly seemed to offer a darker, corrective vision of British society and culture.  That much it achieved.  But watching it again in 2005, I can't help think that it could have sharper, more concise (it's a rambling 2 1/2 hours)and a whole lot funnier.",1128124800,15,4051,4.575589459084605
814129,5,6304221088,"This movie is certainly abnormal- the feeling it engenders is resembles bizzare synthesis of Monty Python, a Clockwork Orange, and Wooster and Jeeves, and it slides wildly from cruelty to satire to farce to oddity and back. Nonetheless, it holds together, and is immensely watchable. In the first half, O'Toole's God of Love is a comedic creation to rank with the best, a bizzare, befuddled Jesus given to outcries of ""I put it in my galvanised pressure cooker! Hroom!"" Nonetheless, the machinations of his aristocratic family, and the knowledge that these madmen are in power, give even this exuberantly fun part something of an edge. In the second half, his transformation into Jack the Ripper marks the movie's descent into something out of a Philip K. Dick novel, showing a world where madness and violence abound, and viciousness is the key to high society. While such an abrupt turn would be fatal to most movies, but this one carries, maintaining its sense of black humor and hatred of the upper classes.

The movie has its faults, most notably the unavoidable feeling that one is watching a play on film, and not a movie, and I can easily see myself skipping the second half when in a lighthearted mood, but it is nonetheless a great and well executed piece of cinema.

It was eccentric enough to fit my tastes and to break out of the norm of so many movies that just don't stand up to multiple viewings (plus it completely changed my view of Peter O'Toole).  This is a movie I will re-visit time and again.",1031961600,28,883,4.147058823529412

814237,5,6304221088,"Up there with Bunuel's work as an analysis of elitism and also up there with ""Cannibal! The Musical!"" as the strangest (and funniest) musical ever made, this is a treat.
Its length can seem intimidating, but it goes by quickly.  The opening half has a lot of the feel and wit of Victorian drawing room comedies, only infinitely more scandalous and blasphemous.  After the 13th Earl of Guerney buys the farm in rather spectacular fashion, it goes to his son, Jack.  Only Jack would prefer Joshua; you see, he thinks he's Jesus Christ.  This naturally scandalizes his uncle, who of course is out for the family money.
To blow what follows wouldn't be fair, because you won't see it coming.  Suffice to say this goes from being light, witty comedy to something much more serious; the line I quoted above closes out the film and it's one of the more chilling things you'll hear.

814239,4,6304221088,"As brilliant as this movie is, I can only give it 4 stars because its pacing often drags.  However, if viewed with patience, this is a very worthwhile film to watch and a wonderful satirical examination of classism (specifically British).
Peter O'Toole, playing Jack Gurney, inherits an estate and a title from his eccentric father. This is much to his relatives' horror since Jack believes that he is Jesus/the God of Love.  They come up with a scheme to marry him to a prostitute so she will bear him an heir, then they can lock him away for life, thus avoiding any embarrassment to his title.  Jack starts out as a harmless eccentric who loves and accepts all people and rejects materialism (which frightens visiting snobs).  However, as the result of the interference of his relatives and his psychiatrist, he begins to believe instead that he is Jack the Ripper/the God of Wrath.
While Jack's new personality is far more disturbing than his original harmless eccentricities, he is now accepted by the ruling class as one of them.  Since he now answers to his own name (Jack) and begins to act like a racist and snobby bigot, his relatives believe him to be perfectly sane.  The upper class applauds his newfound goal of reintroducing capital punishment and torture to the corrections system in order to restore a grip of fear over the lower classes and restore dignity to Britain.  The fact that he refers to himself as the Lord also no longer draws attention since, through his inheritance, he is now a member of the House of Lords.  One particularly striking scene has Jack perceiving the House of Lords as a decayed hall occupied by rotting corpses even as the members wildly applaud his speech, a very biting commentary on that institution's nature.
Sure, the satire is a bit one-sided, but I have had enough personal experience with members of the elite who are completely out of touch with reality to recognize that there is little exaggeration in it, and I find great personal satisfaction watching this movie.  O'Toole's performance is also excellent and fun to watch.  Highly recommended.",1010448000,17,2102,4.83008356545961
814240,5,6304221088,"This wicked, hilarious and original piece of filmmaking could be the wildest British movie ever made as it boldly goes... in all directions, milking Barnes' brilliant idea for all its comedic worth : as long as poor (actually filthy rich) Jack believes he's God, his relatives want to commit him -- but when he turns into a killer, they start adoring him as he takes his place in high society.
While I don't know about Jack, I firmly believe that Peter O'Toole IS God. If his audacious and mesmerizing performance wasn't reason enough to want to own that DVD, the Criterion edition is a MUST since it offers a delightful commentary by the 3 Peters which is both insightful and funny -- you even get to hear O'Toole's inimitable laughter. Hours and hours of bliss.",1008460800,10,763,4.659259259259259
814355,4,6304221088,"Jack may be an English Lord, but he's clearly nuts: he thinks he's Jesus Christ.  And then he's ""cured"" and comes to believe that he is in fact Jack the Ripper.  Peter Medak directs and Peter O'Toole stars in ""THE RULING CLASS,"" an irreverent and hysterical black comedy from 1972 based on the notorious play by Peter Barnes.  A truly outrageous film of ideas both caustic and urbane. The three brilliant Peters share the incredibly funny and insightful commentary track. This is the 154 minute director's cut.  Cool extras include Medak's home movies shot during production.  An esteemed cult classic that still delivers.",1007856000,16,622,5.0
814356,4,6304221088,"The Ruling Class is a brilliant film, based on a brilliant play. The story is simple enough. The Earl of Gurney dies, his heir is mad, and thinks he is Jesus Christ. The other members of the family attempt to dislodge the new nutty earl so that they can keep the cash. Their attempts to commit the earl trace the flaws in the English class system with unpleasant accuracy and a great deal of sometimes very black humour. It all comes to a sticky and very black ending.
It says alot that Peter O'Toole is continually upstaged by just about everyone else in the cast. His Christ figure is very well delivered but, all in all, lacks some level of ""humanness"" that the other characters, particularly Arthur Lowe as the butler, have in abundance. Arthur Lowe literally steals scene after scene with one or two lines while the vast tracts of dialogue that O'Toole's character must deliver can quickly alienate a less than motivated viewer.
The above said, this can be a very funny film and is directed with enough aplomb that one is not continually reminded of the scripts start as a stage play. While it was obviously controversial when it was made and while the ideas it traces are just as pertinent now, somehow time seems to have dealt poorly with it and left it less a ""searing indictment"" and more of a historical curiosity.
The DVD master is brilliant, sharp and without any artifacting, and as one expects from Criterion, in the correct aspect ratio. If you want to see this film this is a magnificent way to do it.
As far as owning it goes, Arthur Lowe's performance will delight anyone with a sense of humour for years to come.
Quite highly recommended but a bit self indulgently black.",1007424000,53,1690,4.580858085808581
814357,2,6304221088,"If the devil has the best tunes, the right have the best jokes.  What is it about 'committed', liberal satire that sees it hurling wild pot-shots that continually miss the funny bone?  'The Ruling Class' charts the plot of the aristocratic Gurney family to get the current Earl to marry, propagate an heir and be declared a lunatic.  He has just been released from an asylum on the death of his tutu-wearing father, whose bedtime ritual of mock-suicide went fatally wrong.  Jack prefers to be called J.C., and is convinced he is God, attempting to preach love to narrow-minded, money-grabbing relatives who don't know what it means.  Whenever negative insinuations of reality and conspiracy infiltrate his serene divinity, he retreats to a giant crucifix looming near the hall.
'the Ruling Class' is one of those bloated allegories about the decline, decadence, corruption blah blah of Britain and its impreialist past, like 'Oh What a Lovely War' and Lindsay Anderson's films.  its structure is that of a revue, in which chunks of theatrical, dialogue-heavy 'wit' (the film is based on a play) is punctuated by fantasy and musical routines, just as J.C.'s 'madness' destabilises the narrow reality of his relatives' secure world.
the problem with these epic satires is that they're not believable.  Whereas, say, Evelyn Waugh, Anthony Powell or Nancy Mitford knew their worlds intimately, knew the people and the crucial details that would reveal or pinpoint crisis and decline; leftist satirists either don't know the world they attack, and so their broad gestures and caricatures lack force; or they are so burdened by the chip on their shoulders, they can't see the crucial Achilles' heel that would finally finish off their target.
None of this would matter if the film, like 'Oh What a lovely war' or Lindsay Anderson, was actually funny.  Comedy here is replaced by heavy-handed irony, noise, 'significant' set-pieces and over-emphasis.  The target is also irrelevant: the aristocracy haven't been a ruling class in Britain for decades, merely marginal eccentrics for the tourists this film is aimed at (apparently, it is much admired in America, where it was shot - so much for authenticity!).
If the film has a saving grace, it is the priceless ensemble acting - William Mervyn as the heartless, phlegmatic uncle; Coral Browne his icy, lubricious wife; Arthur Lowe as a long-suffering butler suddenly released from politeness by a large inheritance; and, especially, the great Alistair Sim as a barmy Bishop.  But Peter O'Toole as a batty aristocrat who thinks he's God?  He shouldn't be encouraged.",1006732800,9,2608,5.127358490566038
814358,5,6304221088,"Only the Brits seem to be able to spoof their classist divisions with such style and irony.  Peter O'Toole is the manic depressive son of an Earl whose untimely death promotes Jack (O'Toole) to center stage.  The family, concerned with appearances and control, are at wits end, and so devise a plan to dupe Jack - who thinks he's God, BTW, into marrying his uncle's mistress so an heir can be produced who is suitably malleable to the family's machinations.  The family is divided, and a race to get Jack ""well"" before the heir is born results in Jack's metamorphosis to Jack the Ripper...which in true ironic flair - is far more acceptable in their high society than Jack the loving God.  Many layers of humor, a thinking person's comedy.",1005264000,8,739,4.661538461538462
814359,5,6304221088,"At long last the outrageous 1972 British farce, ""The Ruling Class"" has arrived on DVD in all its demented glory - and I do mean ALL as it includes an additional 13 minutes of footage to the ""uncut"" version released in 1983, making this a true ""director's cut"" running the complete 154 minutes. Director Peter Medak even supervised this restoration, and the entire Criterion Collection package provides enough extras (including Medak's 16mm ""home movies"" shot during the filming) for hours of viewing enjoyment. Play the brief trailer first (for comparison's sake) and you will see just how impressive this remastering is with strikingly deep color saturation and crisply upgraded monaural sound.
But even this glorious widescreen presentation can hardly contain the quirky antics and surreal goings-on that parade before your eyes and ears. Medak has directed this potentially unwieldy material by aiming to get the biggest laughs out of even the most trifling bits of humor, be they visual or verbal, front-stage or in the background. And he keeps the pace so frenetic you won't be bored for a minute.
Brooding more deeply than he did in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", shouting louder than he did in ""The Lion in Winter"", Peter O'Toole plays the 14th Earl of Gurney, a royal heir considered ""bonkers"" by his relatives, who is right at home as Jesus Christ sprawled over a giant cross, or as Jack the Ripper brandishing a switchblade. At one point, as the latter, he leads the cast in a rambunctious vaudeville version of ""Dem Bones"", one of several bizarre and hilarious musical interludes (including a striptease!) that crop up thoughout the film.  The supporting cast includes such high profile names as Alistair Sim, Nigel Green, Coral Browne and Harry Andrews; but, as with most British films, even the smallest role is cast to perfection.
This is one DVD that will definitely not collect dust on your shelf. You'll be pulling it down to show friends, or just to watch your favorite scenes when you need a good belly laugh.
As the 14th Earl asks early on, ""Is everybody HAPPY?"" Yes, indeed we are. And thank you again Criterion!",1004486400,11,2124,4.932960893854749
814360,5,6304221088,"While the reviews are accurate, I think more can be said about the subtleties in this film. Some have said O'Toole's great and others thought shabby. I agree with both, and I think the film is stronger for it. Many have said the beginning is dry, but some would say the same for the beginnings of the four gospels, or Kazantzakis' ""Last Temptation Of Christ""  (but this is a narrative device). I'm not going to quote from the review I've written for this film. But I will discuss one aspect of my argument for those who are interested in buying the film and for those who've seen it and didn't like it.  The O'Toole (character) doesn't simply believe he's christ, but I would argue, he's really his double. Shortly after his arrival on the scene, he reveals the ""new dispensation"" which--while not opposed to christ--is beside christ and his ""old dispensation"": ""the old dispensation according to mark... redeemed the soul,"" but satan found something new to exploit (""the love of self""), ""the new dispensation gives it [that redemption] to the body as well..."" This new christ, I wouldn't deny the O'Toole character as being anything other than a new christ is going through those very transformations of the old christ (temptation, skepticism, trial, crucifixion, resurrection, and according to some, marriage, sex, and so on). The repetition is the same but with a difference, for instance, the redemption of the body... is this not a postmodern theme (Foucault wrote ""the order of things"" in 1966 published in english in 1970 Peter Barns published ""the ruling class"" in 69, to give you a sense of the milieu)? This is why J.C. (designating the O'Toole character) keeps on saying, ""have sex,"" and so on.  But isn't he a paranoid schizophrenic (the doctor Herder's (sic) analysis)? And isn't he a bourgeois (Tucker's analysis)? And isn't he a lord (his uncles analysis?)? And isn't he artistic (his aunt's analysis)? Perhaps he is all or one of these. This depends on how you read films and where you draw the lines on the credulity of interpretations. For sure he exhibits the symptoms of schizophrenia (but isn't this part of the postmodern condition?). For sure he exhibits the position of the (modern, avant-garde: e.g. Breton) upper class. There's a certain level where he is all of these and none of these. His character is precisely the play of these different selves and revealing precisely the plasticity of the self. In our epoch we don't only have the multiplication of christ figures (Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, etc.) we also have the power to be or identify ourselves-without the aid of any ""grade-A Galilee miracles""-with christ (hegel would have loved it). Or perhaps it's our epoch that we will no longer allow the possibility of another christ, either we turn them into madmen, murderers, geniuses, and so on.  Those of you who have the movie and those of you who'll buy it, watch it a few times, or research the harangues (or preaches, or poems, which so ever you please) he gives and you'll realize that either he is a christ, a madman, a murderer, or a genius, a poet, a pilot, or a lord. All and none of these... Precisely, a god. (I find I cannot resign myself to choosing one). (I love the scene where he's in the attic taking off the masks and re-defines his identity to the god of the old testament as well as jack the ripper). For instance, at his third crucifixion (for every time he puts his glasses on I designate a crucifixion) he says something like ""don't forget that I'm not only the father, the sun, and the holy spirit, but also LLB, DFC, and ADC..."" now these could be the ravings of a lunatic (and they are on one level), but he could be (in an American dictionary) a bachelor of law, member of the Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Defense Command or Aide-de-camp or Aid to Dependant Children, or again the rants of a lunatic, a murderer, a king, a poet, or a genius.

814362,5,6304221088,"The Ruling Class remains a unique film in many ways. Totally iconoclastic, brilliantly concieved and executed, original in style and tone from start to finish, it is both hilarious and touching in its story of the 14th Earl  of Gurney (played by Peter O'Toole) who believes himself to be Jesus  Christ. The picture painted of the British upper classes is mercilessly  biased but the comedy that is mined from their shallowness and greed is as  funny as when the film was made. O'Toole's performance is delightful. He  gets to do a little bit of everything in this film, including sing and  dance. The cast of supporting players is brilliant, especially Alister Sim  as a tongue tied Bishop trying to perform a wedding between 'Christ' and  the bride picked for him by his family so they can control his fortune.  Other standouts include such characters as 'The Master in Lunacy', who  decides that the Earl is sane because he has the right school pretensions.  The pivotal twist of the plot comes in the 'healing' sequence when the Earl  is transformed from 'Christ' into 'Jack'. Unfortunately, the Jack in  question is Jack the Ripper. This new persona seems so much more sane, but  violently less so.
This is a strange concoction but never fails to  amuse. Everything about it continues to be fresh because nothing about it  has ever been copied. It is a one of a kind film that deserves a place in  any serious video collection of great, original movies.",958435200,18,1457,4.764

The movie had us laughing and then gasping but this was due to Peter O'Toole's fine performance where he is playing in a sense, several different characters and remaining just that one person.
I did not want to put down the cash for this DVD and this is where I hesitated but we were both very happy with this work of the entire ensemble but still both agreeing that the award winning acting was all Peter O'Toole. There were times where my partner asked, ""Can you rewind that"" so we could re-watch Peter O'Toole's performance in the garden sitting on the bench after everyone departs, in the attic, the speech in the end, etc. We turned a 2/12 hour movie into 3 1/2 hours and I plan to watch it again.

7865547,5,6304221088,"The British sense of humor is something completely different. Sarcastic, witty, poignant and devastating. The ruling class is a chamber piece that bets for all those little minor sins that nest around the luxurious mansions and well renowned dynasties. Told with that razor edge cynicism, the plot turns about a wealthy descendant that firmly believes himself he is Jesus.

Peter O' Toole in one of his greatest achievements in his lifetime, underlines and makes a tour de force expedition to the last frontiers of the insanity. Acidic comments here and there, laughable situations around the crew; clever statements around the sacred rules of a twisted urbanity, make of this piece one of its kind.

Peter Medak who gave us the memorable psycho thriller ""The changeling"" (With George Scott) was the director. The fabulous script literally catch us from start to end and makes us to think and rethink about the thin red line between what's right and what's wrong.
