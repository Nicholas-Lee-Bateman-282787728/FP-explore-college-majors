3698145,5,B001MK8X2Y,"I'm about 43 now.  I grew up in the farmland of Illinois with a pond across the street and a river running behind our house.  Unfortunately, I did not get into hockey (leagues, pick-up)until I moved to Texas about 14 years ago.  This movie makes me see the opportunity that I missed.  Wow... I had frozen fun waiting for me all winter and just took it for granted.  Some day I will make up for it.  I will return to my hometown (900 miles away) in the winter months with skates, stick and puck and I'll skate on that pond and the river.  You guys who were able to enjoy pond hockey as kids are truly blessed.  It's very sad that kids only go to the indoor rinks now days.  There is a quote in this movie that says it all, ""I wish I could be 8 years old again, just for a few days.""",1269216000,6,781,3.9870967741935486
3698146,4,B001MK8X2Y,"Pond Hockey was very good, a die hard hockey fan will enjoy this more than the average fan, even more so if you play hockey and have had the chance to skate outdoors..",1267574400,5,167,4.090909090909091
3698147,5,B001MK8X2Y,"I have been a hockey parent, coach, collector and fan for over fifty years, and this wonderful DVD is a must-own for all you hockey pucks out there. It ranks right up there with the two DVDs ""The Forgotten Miracle"" and ""Golden: The Hobey Baker Story"", plus the two books ""Home Ice"" and ""Open Ice"" by Jack Falla. I know Billy Cleary and I knew the late Jack Falla, and ""Pond Hockey"" shows the love that they and the other interviewees have for the outdoor game. This film will convince you, if you need convincing, that every single day on a pond or an outdoor home rink is more valuable to your young player than a dozen structured games and practices.

3698148,5,B001MK8X2Y,"Truley an awesome documentary, but somewhat heartbreaking for a little hockey player from Mississippi who dreams of playing on a pond. I highly recommend it.",1233619200,4,157,5.32
3698149,5,B001MK8X2Y,"I first saw the film ""Pond Hockey"" in Iowa City, Iowa this summer at the Landlocked Film Festival and loved it! Having lived in upstate New York, which is also ""hockey country"", I was fascinated to watch the story unfold. This film was not just about following the National Pond Hockey championships, it was addressing the concern about the disappearance of the culture of pond hockey. The minute I viewed this film, I knew that it was a great film to buy for my brother-in-law who constructs his own pond to play hockey on each winter. When he unwrapped his Christmas gift, he was delighted and my sister reported that he watched the whole movie immediately and shared it with other pond hockey lovers in the family. In 28 years, this was the first time ever that I ""iced it"" when selecting a gift for my brother-in-law. Our family highly recommends this film to everyone who loves hockey and those who want to ""catch their passion""!",1231372800,22,934,4.632530120481928

Pond Hockey captures the essence of what really matters most when playing a sport with friends. Movies like these get me excited to have my own children someday, and share this movie with them.",1228262400,11,371,4.3

Not bad by any stretch - just not what I expected.
This is basically footage of a non contact, no goalie outdoor hockey tournament, mixed with a little backstory of each of the members of the two featured teams.

3698208,5,B001MK8X2Y,"Beautiful documentary tracing the history of hockey culture -- but really made me look at the way we raise kids now vs. 40 years ago; the life-lessons today's children are missing out on when we over-parent.

Follows a few pond teams of semi skill level but one guy loves himself so much, his ego leaves you with a bad taste. You could see why he never made it pro.

3698229,5,B001MK8X2Y,This is a great movie for any player or fan of the sport of hockey. It shows real people playing the sport they love and having fun. It emphasizes the importance of playing for fun which is sadly lost in the search for greatness these days.,1354924800,,240,4.239130434782608

3698233,4,B001MK8X2Y,"Another reviewer lamented the lack of organization and overall coherence in this film.
I can see that too.
Yet, I liked it.

What's the real story?
These few dudes who are trying to win the Pond Hockey Championship?
That's not very compelling.

The really compelling story is how hockey has turned into a business, and kids spend more time covered in pads, learning to check and avoid offsides, than they do just skating.
Something has been lost over the years; kids used to just love to skate outside and play hockey.  A lot of them went on to play on teams in organized leagues at the high school level and beyond.
Fathers spent a lot of time out there on the ice with their kids.

This film captures part of that sentiment, that yearning for the old days, the joy and innocence of watching bundled-up children skating on a frozen lake or in a neighborhood park.
And remembering what it was like to be a kid.

For those who grew up in Canada and the northern areas of the US (especially MN), parts of this film will touch a tender place in the heart.
The rest of this will seem a little thin.
I still recommend it for the nostalgic experience.",1332201600,,1145,4.407582938388626
3698234,3,B001MK8X2Y,"I sat right behind Neal Broten at the premiere. Being a Minnesota native, a hockey player and growing up on a pond myself, I was honestly disappointed with the lack of substance in the film. Granted, there wasn't much a a budget and the production quality was a little weak, but with this much access to so many people who love the game you would think the character selection would have been better. See for yourself... Make your own judgement, but coming from a hockey player who lived on a pond playing day and night, there's a lot missing from this story. The journey and the story are poorly organized as well. It's a bunch of random players talking into a camera. I give it 3 stars because I love the concept and love the game. This was a seriously missed opportunity to do something really special. Bummer.",1327363200,,813,4.5
3698235,1,B001MK8X2Y,"I am more than embarrassed that I fell for the rave reviews and gave my husband such an awful gift.  As an avid hockey fan and former player, I thought this was a great gift for him.  Wrong!  He watched 63 minutes of it and gave up waiting for the good part to start - the best he could say about it was that it was BORING.  I sat all the way through it and can't argue about that.  The few cameo appearances by the likes of great players like Gretzky can't spark any life into it.  I was hoping for a really great film.  This is not it - my husband said if I paid more than 99 cents for it, I paid too much - which is not fair since the clam shell it came in is worth that much!",1324771200,2,679,3.73943661971831
