8312732,4,B00008G7U8,Haven't gotten all the way through yet but I love this guy. The intermittent band playing samples is awesome. I did take a music theory class so for me it is great. Possibly if you have never played it might be a little more difficult.,1481932800,,235,4.2444444444444445

Well explain & fun",1464393600,,47,4.333333333333333
8312734,1,B00008G7U8,"I purchased this dvd, because I wanted to learn how to play the keyboard.  The instructor went from showing you the scale right into playing music with his band.  Definately not for someone playing for the first time.  Do not waste your money.",1200960000,7,243,4.604651162790698
8312735,1,B00008G7U8,"I have never played the keyboard or piano before, therefore I thought this would be a great help.  It wasn't.  I learned more about the keyboard from the little book that came with the keyboard than I did from this DVD.  Maybe once I learn to play the keyboard, this will be a great way to learn to play the different styles it talks about, but right now I need to learn the basics and this was no help.",1176076800,18,403,4.075949367088608
8312736,4,B00008G7U8,"This DVD is a great way to get started on the keyboard asap.  It goes over scales, chords, hand positions, and styles.  Very detailed and it also features a jam session with a band.",1143763200,14,181,4.294117647058823
