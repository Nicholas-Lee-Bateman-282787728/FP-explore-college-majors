3140521,5,B00157OI9Q,"This is easily the best F4 cartoon made yet.  The personalities and chemistry of the group is pretty spot on the those of the comic.  For the first time ever we get to see Ronan and Accuser and Dragon Man in animated form.  If your a Marvel fan, you've gotta pick this up.  I'm very happy with this purchase and have thorougly enjoyed it.",1231286400,,338,4.234375
3140522,5,B00157OI9Q,"After borrowing the first volume from the local library, I was pretty well turned off to the series, but then there was a discount copy of volume 2 at BigLots...after that, I was hooked. I definitely enjoyed the skrull and Accuser story arcs that spanned several episodes in that volume. I decided that it warranted another look, and I wasn't disappointed. The writing is witty and memorable, and it was with the outside chance of seeing the frightful four, that I wanted to get this one, thinking that the zombie four might make an appearance. Still, even though Galactus is missing, this is probably Marvel's best animated product yet - the animation is simply superb - like a good penciler.",1224460800,,693,4.783333333333333
3140523,5,B00157OI9Q,"Ok, so maybe its not the worlds greatest cartoon about heroes, but this box set is pretty amazing still. I was VERY skeptical about this series when it started airing on TV. I didn't fall in love with the look right away. I hated the movies and this seemed to be based off of the movie version of the team. Things were not looking good for the latest animated FF. Then something happened that changed how I felt completely: I watched the show. IT'S AWESOME! The animation is great. The character design totally works. The voice acting really suits the characters and the animation is beautiful. I watched one of these DVDs recently on a friends MAC and it looked even better! The colors and clarity really leaped out on a higher definition television. But back to the boxed set:

This set contains over 20 episodes. Most of the major FF villians are featured and even some heroes make appearances on a few episodes. Marvel comics fans will be happy to learn that the main producers of the show are Craig Kyle and Chris Yost. These guys have a huge love for the Marvel U and really treat the FF with respect. You can tell that it's comics fans who are writing the stories and not some disinterested Hollywood writer who's just getting handed a check. There are some visual elements put in there just for the fans, even if they have nothing to do with the episode plot-wise. Little touches like that were some of what really drew me into the show.

I've read some bad reviews for this series and I really couldn't disagree more. This series is wonderful, funny, exciting and just gets better and better as the episodes go on. I was reluctant to give this a shot, but I'm so glad that I did. Any fans of the Fantastic Four comics or movies should definitely own this. Fans of superhero animation should get a copy as well. This is a series that I will definitely watch again and again. My only fear is that there may not be a season 2...",1219795200,,1934,4.429775280898877
3140524,5,B00157OI9Q,"If you're a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four, it's hard not to be judgmental when you first catch a peep of this show. But if you can get past the retooled character and costume designs (for the FF and their villains), and Reed's unruly mop of hair and Johnny's anime-influenced spiky do, and that spray-painted ""4"" on Ben's chest - then you might get that this is a pretty good animated series. Or was, anyway, since it's been canned already.

FANTASTIC FOUR: WORLD'S GREATEST HEROES debuted in September 2006 on the Cartoon Network. For the curious ones, this happens to be the fourth television incarnation of Marvel's first superhero family, succeeding the 1967, 1978 (with H.E.R.B.I.E. taking over for the Torch), and the 1994 versions. It's the hippest and funniest TV adaptation yet.

The series captures the essence of these characters. I've always liked Reed Richards, but he's never been the ideal leading man. Here, he seems to be younger but as typically bland and henpecked (thanks, Sue), although at times his personality channels the hipper Ultimate Reed Richards. Johnny Storm, patterned after the live action film's version, has never been more brash and immature, but he grew on me, and there are many times when he landed me in the silly giggles. He and H.E.R.B.I.E. provide a lot of the humor. The ever-lovin' Thing is still a tragic monster, but big-hearted, as demonstrated in ""Contest of Champions."" Johnny's older sis, Susan, consistently plays the role of the grown-up in the team and makes a formidable second-in-command. I'm glad that H.E.R.B.I.E. is back in the mix. This time H.E.R.B.I.E. is the self-aware computer system which Reed constructs to help run the Baxter Building. I dig how persistently cheerful and neurotic this new incarnation of H.E.R.B.I.E. is.

The mythos and spirit of the FF are well translated onto the screen. The sci-fi backdrop. Reed's futuristic gadgets. The classic and complex supervillains. The FF's constant family bickerings and infighting. As per norm, Reed's powerhouse intellect and scientific curiosity dictate that the team, besides holding down that saving the world gig, also acts as part-time explorers. As such, the foursome frequently end up in peculiar environments, whether it's the Microverse, the Negative Zone, on a different planet, or even in an alternate timeline. The Fantastic Four have always been adventurers on an epic scale. Mining from the FF mythos, quite a few of the episodes here are inspired by classic FF stories from the comic book (the FF getting evicted, Reed and Doom trading bodies, the Baxter Building being launched into space, the coming of Terminus, etc.).

The scattershot TV scheduling never gave the show a chance to build a loyal following. In my case, the sporadic airing left me lukewarm and even feeling critical of the episodes, and of the changes effected. But, now, having just seen the entire run on this box set, I've come around 180. After steady viewing, the continuity and cohesiveness of the show are more readily discerned, despite that the stories tended to be episodic. Past events are recalled in later episodes. Torch's fear of water is revisited a number of times. The Baxter Building tenants have recurring appearances.

As done by the French-based animation house, Moonscoop, the animation is crazy bananas - a cool, fairly smooth integration of 2D and CG, and rendered with lush and vivid colors. Everything looks great - the FF certainly, but also the revamped classic villains. And the background details are exquisite stuff! The city landscape, for example, is impressively depicted time and again. The ""Annihilate"" episode, in particular, showcases some stunning visuals. And, the stuff's presented in anamorphic widescreen. Also, I don't want to leave out the episode title cards, which struck me as cool and arresting visuals. The theme song, however, is dang weak.

Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes: The Complete First Season, in four discs, collects all 26 episodes, quite a few of which never got a chance to be aired. This terrific looking box set offers these bonus features: audio commentaries by Head Writer Chris Yost and Exec Producer Craig Kyle on 3 episodes: ""My Neighbor Was A Skrull,"" ""Contest of Champions,"" and ""Scavenger Hunt""; ""From Origin to Animation"" (18 minutes long) tracks the FF's conception and evolution and includes an interview with Stan Lee; ""Rise of the Rogues"" (9 minutes) covers the FF's classic villains (again, with Stan Lee); ""Traveling to New Dimensions"" focuses on the animation work and features interviews with the Moonscoop crew; four art galleries, including one showcasing some classic FF comic book covers; and even a miniature comic book reprinting Ultimate Fantastic Four #1.

The surface tweaks might be disconcerting at first, but, trust me, just roll with them. You'll find that this is the quintessential Fantastic Four. The same dysfunctional team, the same family of superheroes. Ben's self-loathing as a monster, Ben and Johnny's non-stop teasing and pranking, the classic supervillains, all these bring a retro feel to the show, hearkening back to when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were doing the honors on the World's Greatest Magazine. And, really, when was the Fantastic Four franchise ever better than when those two old coots were running it?

3140525,4,B00157OI9Q,"Fantastic Four:  World's Greatest Heroes is the fourth animated TV series for Marvel Comics's flagship title.  Premiering on the Cartoon Network the show has had a bit of a spotty broadcast history but now you can see the complete first season, including several unaired episodes, in this set just released by Fox Home Video.

Now a word of warning, while the series is largely faithful in idea to the comics, this is a re-imagining of the characters and they are given a more 21st century look.  This results in both good and bad.  The updated looks are just fine and who really wants to see Sue Storm with a bouffant hairdo anyway?  The only exception is Johnny Storm who looks like he belongs in a Dragon Ball Z cartoon rather than the Fantastic Fantastic Four.  Ughh!  Just horrible!  It doesn't end with Johnny's/The Human Torch's look.  His character absolutely annoying.  Even a teenaged Johnny Story was never this obnoxious in the comics.  After a few episodes his personality begins to grate on you.

Reed Richard's personality and voice acting (Hiro Kanagawa) is also week.  Reed sounds like a frat boy nerd who lacks confidence, almost the opposite of the analytical, often emotionally stunted scientist from the comics.  On the other hand, The Invisible Girl and the Thing are done quite well.  Admittedly, it's not hard to do Ben Grimm buy Brian Dobson nails him as well as you can.  Lisa Gilchrist gives us a Sue Storm who is more forceful and self-assured.  With a nod to the animated show of the 70s, there's even a return of H.E.R.B.I.E, this time as the F.F.'s super-computer.

As far as the stories goes, this series has the most dynamic array of villains and guest stars in any FF cartoon series yet.  Thankfully it's not all about battling arch-nemesis Dr. Doom over and over.  Besides Doom, the roster of villains includes The Skrulls, The Mole Man. Puppet Master, the Super-Skrull, Annihilus, Terminus, Diablo, The Frightful Four, Attuma, and Ronan the Accuser.  Guest-stars feature The Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and the Submariner.  Alas, however, there is no Silver Surfer or Galactus in the first season episodes.

Then animation is produced by the French company Moonscoop, best known for the Code Lyoko series, also broadcast on the Cartoon Network.  Like that show, the Fantastic Four combines traditional 2D animation with 3D CGI animation with a distinct, but not overwhelming, anime look.  This is a nice change of pace from the more cartoony look of shows like The Teen Titans.  The 3D allows for better visual effects.  It was noted in one of the featurettes that Moonscoop originally wanted to give Sue Storm pink hair and thankfully Marvel nixed that idea.  Those crazy French!

Even though the series doesn't faithfully adapt any comic stories they do come reasonably close.

""Trial by Fire"" stars the villainous Kree Accuser Ronan, who puts Johnny on trial after the Torch destroys several Kree probes.  This is a loose adaptation of Fantastic Four #65 Vol. 1.

""Revenge of the Skrulls"" features the Super-Skrull, a Skrull augmented with the powers of all four members of the F.F.

""World's Tiniest Heroes"" finds the team shrinking due to an experiment of Reed's gone haywire.  The episode guest-stars the Hank Pym version of Ant Man and is based on a story appearing in Fantastic Four #16, Vol. 1.

There are guest-stars aplenty in the show:  The Hulk and the Thing have one of their classic battles in ""Hard Knocks"" The Sub-Mariner shows up a couple of times, and Iron Man helps the team battle several sets of his armor that has been taken over by Dr. Doom.

The writers did a good job of capturing the spirit of the comic, particularly the first volume but with a modern sensibility and pizzazz.  They missed the boat, though, by omitting the Silver Surfer and Galactus, which is arguably one of the most famous story arcs in Marvel history.",1219363200,4,3893,4.832072617246596
3140526,5,B00157OI9Q,"This show is what the new ""The Batman"" series is to the '90s Batman:TAS.  The animation, while having a very slight anime look to it regarding the characters, and the CG effects are a seemless blend into the traditional 2D cell animation.  What I mean by that is that the CG is used to give some of the environmental landscapes and vehicles a true 3D look.  What I really like about the vehicles, especially the everyday civilian vehicles, is that they're modeled after real-world cars.  The Taxis and Police cars of NYC are Ford Crown Vics, and in several scenes you can pick out the new Chrysler 300Cs.  In the Puppet Master episode, his original vehicle was a early 2000s Chevy S10, and I think I even saw a new Chevy Colorado truck in NYC.  All of these are modeled in 3D.  I mention all this, because in most animated series, the cars are generic shapes that do not resemble any real-life cars.  I just thought that was a nice touch in this series.  It may date the show in the long run, but it's cool now.

Oh, one more thing...the New York city scapes.  Fully rendered in 3D and fully textured.  So no generic half-animated city scapes in this series.  Something most other cartoons do to save money.  But since these are modeled in 3D, its easy to show them in every scene necessary.

Now as for the stories, yeah, I agree with trashcanman.  There's a bit of a departure from classic comic book story arcs, but so what?  The humor thrown in makes up for it.  And it's a smart humor too.  Not too childish.  In fact, it reminds me alot of the characterizations used in the two feature films.  The Johnny Storm in these series is modeled almost exactly like Chris Evans in the films.

Sound quality on these discs?  Fantastic!  No pun intended.  5.1 surround mix that is really active and very directional.  Rear channels are put to good use for special effects and all.  Picture quality?  Good too...16x9 anamorphic transfer.  My only complaint is that the show's contrast levels are a bit high.

UPDATE:  Now that I've had a chance to view the entire set, I must say that this is the best animated superhero series since the DCAU ""Justice League"" series.  The banter between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm is extremely clever for an animated show.  And then you have Susan Storm acting as the surrogate mother to the whole team, especially when she tries to reel back Reed Richards to reality when he goes off on some techno-babble when explaining a relatively simple endenture.

The only thing that I was disappointed with is that there were no episodes dedicated to the Silver Surfer and Galactus story.  I mean how can you do a Fantastic Four show with no Silver Surfer stories?  And I guess I'm also a bit disappointed in that the ""special power"" effects weren't CG enough, unlike Justice League.  However those episodes that had cross-over superhero appearances, like The Hulk, Iron-Man, She-Hulk, and Namor, were quite good.  Even the one with the villians Frightful Four was great.  Nice take on the classic Klaw character.  (I remember my cousin having a Klaw figure back in the early '80s.)

Anyway, I have been totally impressed with this series.  It totally surprised me.  It just goes to show you that don't base a show on preliminary character art designs.",1213142400,9,3273,4.619130434782608
3140527,5,B00157OI9Q,"Let's get one thing straight, this is not a FF series for old-school Marvel fanboys; the kind who complain that an adaptation is cheesy if it is 100% faithful to the original material but go ballistic if they change anything from the comic. I know you know who I'm talking about. This series is a fresh reinvention of the superheroes we know and love and personally I enjoyed it. A lot.

The animation is certainly above average for a cartoon; it's not exactly Pixar, but it's far superior to the more traditional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B0007US7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four - The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;with it's horrible theme song. The look is a uniquely modern mix of eastern and western styles with some nice CG, all of which may be off-putting to those who just want an animated version of a forty year-old comic book (that's already been done...twice) but it works nonetheless. The series' best attribute by far is it's sharp sense of humor. For example, in one episode Dr. Doom manages to switch bodies with Reed Richards after imprisoning himself. Reed, in Doom's fully armored body, escapes and hails a cab. As he sits down in the back of the taxi, the driver eyes him for a second before commenting, ""Hey, you're that Iron Man guy, ain't ya?"". Reed/Doom -rather than explain the insane situation- simply looks at him and responds, ""Yes. Yes I am."". Great stuff, but if the notion of poking fun at classic comic characters is sacrilegious to you, skip this show. Johnny Storm's obnoxious insistence that everyone call Annihilus ""The Annihilator!"" as if he was a professional wrestler won't earn him any fans among the overly earnest Marvel old guard of fandom. But his Doom impression is laugh-out-loud hilarious.

As with all Marvel animated series, this one's got it's share of guest stars including  Iron Man, Ant Man, the Hulk (note to self: don't make fun of his momma), The Sub-Mariner, and more so three cheers for that. The series is episodic so there are no continuous arcs to follow, each show is a twenty minute story full of humorous situations, cool action scenes, and new interpretations of classic villains (the episode where the Skrulls disguise themselves as the FF's neighbors and ask them bizarre questions about their powers/weaknesses is another fun one).  There are recurring characters and call-backs to previous episodes, but the stories themselves are self-contained.  Nice and simple.

While the early 90's animated series was much more faithful to the comic, the animation has not aged well and the early episodes are nearly as cheesy at times as the unwatchable 60's incarnation.  It's a superior show for fans of the comic that improved greatly as it went on, but there is a lot more to like about this incarnation if you can get over the lack of faithfulness to the source material.  This is the FF at their funnest.
Anybody who prefers the older version has probably repressed the memory of Johnny Storm rapping (""flame on and on and on...).

I'm extremely pleased that Marvel has given us this series and NOT based it on the films; and even more so that they have released a full season boxed set.  Sure, they milked some of you with a few single-disc releases first, but for those of you (like me) who crossed their fingers and hoped, here it is: Season One of ""Fantastic Four- World's Greatest Heroes"" complete with NINE unaired episodes, cool featurettes and commentaries, and even an art gallery.  Even the packaging is top notch.  I am well-pleased with this set.  I rate it 4 1/2 stars rounded up for successfully taking on the very difficult task of reinventing one of the last generation's flagship titles.  Enjoy.

3140548,3,B00157OI9Q,"The Fantastic Four are a classic superhero team, but this show doesn't do them justice. Its not a bad show, but it could have been more. The designs are ok, but aren't that impressive. The animation is pretty good, though. The characters are done decently, although Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman have barely any relationship, which is really weird coming into it as a fan of the comic, where they've been married since literally before I was born. Its also not a good change. Reed and Sue's interactions in this cartoon always feel off. They're not quite just friends, but obviously not together. It makes the team dynamic feel weird. The Thing and Human Torch feel similar to the comic versions, although Johnny is probably a bit too stupid at times in the cartoon.

The show has a decent collection of villains and guest stars. Dr. Doom is pretty good in all of his appearances, and he's the best villain in the show. There are also a few guest appearances by other Marvel heroes like Ant-Man and She-Hulk (the episode with She-Hulk is my personal favorite for this series). Overall, the writing for the show is average to ok. I wasn't blown away by much, but I rarely hated an episode. This is a firmly middle of the road show, with some good things but a lot of problems. I'd reccomend it to fans of superhero shows, but I'd make sure FF fans in particular didn't have high expectations. If you want a decent superhero show to pass the time, this is probably worth it. If you want a really good Fantastic Four cartoon, I'd reccomend the second half of the 90's series.",1396828800,,1580,4.563380281690141

3140553,4,B00157OI9Q,"This 21st Century version of the Fantastic Four, for the most part, succeeded in updating the Fantastic Four for a New Generation without losing the fun which made them such great characters.

The show manages to mix in most of the Fantastic Four's core rogue gallery including the Frightful Four, the Mole Man, and of course, Dr. Doom along with some guest appearances by Namor, Ant Man, and Iron Man.

The plots are good science fiction fun with some stories borrowed from the original comic stories and others seeming to go into new directions. The show had a good amount of drama and humor, and some decent action without being too frantic. They managed to capture the group's sense of family.

The only real negative to this series is that Johnny Storm is a bit of a jerk which is something they borrowed from the 2005 movie along with the appearance of Alicia Masters. Though actually, this was better than either of the those films.

The collection includes a few nice features to round this Fantastic collection.",1384560000,,1020,4.745762711864407

I think they are both excellent shows, I'm leaning more towards this one as my favorite the action is fast paced and more consistent, the animation is crisp and clean some of the best I have seen (not to say that the animation in the first series is bad but due to new technology in recent years this is much better) the episodes flow together very well and make sense, UNDERSTAND this is not the old school classic FF but a new and younger group as a true long time marvel fan(I also collect the comics) this did not bother me but it might bother some of the long time fan boys, I think the new look is cool!

I wasn't totally sold when I first saw the costume redesigns & the obvious anime influence in some promo pictures but that aside this show doesn't let down old school Marvel fans. I personally have no quibbles whatsoever with this series & loved how well the source material was balanced with a more modern approach much like the live action movies. This does justice for the less than stellar FF cartoon from back in the 1990's. You also can't beat the price tag here on Amazon for an entire show. 'Nuff said.,1360195200,,596,4.685714285714286
3140560,5,B00157OI9Q,"This newer version of the Fanatastic 4 series in my opinion is better than the original Fantastic 4 in both it's stunning visuals as well as the storys.

You get to see the fantastic 4 from their origin and them gaining their powers, and see them as they grow and learn to use their abilities which get them into various adventures.  It's fun seeing the rivalary between human touch and grim with much sillyness.  The storys are good for both young and older audiences, where older cartoons tended to be a little more kid sentric.  You also see cameo's from other super hero's such as incredible hulk, she hulk, thor and so forth.  Overall I highly reccomend this set to any fan of the fantastic 4, of the super hero genre in general. It was greatly entertaining to watch.",1344297600,,772,4.525179856115108

I loved ""X-men: Evolution,"" and ""The Batman,"" and though i was opposed to it I've grown to like ""Iron Man Armored Adventures."" I mention these because they made major changes to the mythology while staying true to the source material. ""FF World's Greatest Super Heroes"" does much of the same. Heavily influenced by the live action films and the Ultimate take on the characters, the Fantastic Four here are hipper, and cooler than ever put om the screen before. Sure Reed is still a super genius, but now he has a sense of humor, and fun. Sue is a stronger more independant Invisible Woman, and Ben Grimm is the Thing. Not much ever changes about him. Johnny is the comic relief along with Ben and their brotherly relationship is the main set up for a lot of laughs.

I said this takes hints from the movie, and the African-American Alcia Masters is proof, which gives us a African-American Puppet Master. All of the villains have had an update either to their looks or origins, and yet still feel classic. Doom, looks pretty cool, and the Mole man was actually done pretty well. Rona, the Accuser, Super Skrull, and The Impossible man all pop up. And speaking of popping up, there is no shortage of guest spots with Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron man, Namor, and even Ant Man showing up.

If you like the traditional FF with Johnny Storm, this series is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  It restructures many of the original first year FF adventures from 1962 with a modern twist.  I did like the portrayal of Reed Richards as the lead character. The actor who voices him sounds more like a real person; more so than the one in the 1994 version. It looks like they actually cared about what the fans think in this adaptation. Even if it did run for only one season, I don't remember a second, it's the FF at it's best.

All the Fantastic 4's biggest enemies are here including Dr. Doom, The Skrulls, The Kree, Annihilus, and some lesser villains like Mole Man & Impossible Man. It also features great guest appearances from The Hulk, Iron Man and Namor the Submariner. And other than REALLY going out of the way to make Human Torch an unlikeable ass, this series really catches the functioning dysfunctional family life of the 4 like in Marvel Comics more than in the previous 3 TV series.

I'm struck that they tried to make it a little to anime like for my tastes.  I liked most of the animations, but for some reason their version of Doom didn't do it for me.

My biggest annoyance was lack of cute outfits for Sue.  Yeah, perverted or not I do like the cartoon super heroines to dress a little cuter.  She only shows some leg in a few rare scenes and only briefly.  It's almost like they went out of their way to not show any.  Even when the She Hulk visits, there's only maybe a few seconds of the human form in her swimsuit type outfit.  Bummer.  If you like a little more skin, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Unlimited/dp/B000GYI33Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League Unlimited</a>.

Dialog was good, animation good, and stories overall were good.  There are a few weaker episodes, but that's to be expected in any TV series.  I especially loved the Skrulls, who were by far my favorite villains, but they only got two or three appearances.

At 26 episodes, for the price Amazon is charging now, the series is an especially good deal.  It cost $30 when I received it and I'd have bought it myself at that price.  It's a pity it didn't make a second season.  It was one of the good ones.",1278979200,3,1400,4.7190082644628095

""Imperius Rex"" and ""Atlantis Attacks"" were two of my favorite episodes and both have the Sub-Mariner.  The epidsode ""Hard Knocks"" featured a knock down drag out with the Hulk which is my sons favorite episode.

The voice actors and the way they animated the four really do capture the essence of the characters as was intended by Smilin' Stan and the King.  I especially love the way Johnny (Human Torch) is portrayed especially when he screams like a little girl, hilarious!

The story appears to be a continuation from the Fox motion picture because Doom is with the four during their foray into cosmic rays.  This is all presented during the opening credits which by the way features a catchy little techno riff that really grows on you.  So pick this up and you won't be disapointed I promise.

3140570,4,B00157OI9Q,"To be honest, I've been a casual Fantastic Four fan most of my life. Picking up an issue here or there is usually how I'd catch up with what was going on in their comic. There were other Marvel characters that I had more of a connection with, sadly. Thanks to my fascination with animation over the last year and the fact that I needed a good 'Superhero' fix, I decided to get the complete first season of Fantastic Four:World's Greatest Heroes. The show itself is about a group of superheroes that gain their powers after cosmic ray exposure. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is a scientist who can stretch his body like a rubber band. Ben Grimm (The Thing) is super strong and almost indestructible. Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman) can turn invisible and create force fields at will while her somewhat younger brother Johnny (The Human Torch) can manipulate fire at will. What sets this show apart from other incarnations of the Fantastic Four is the look of the show. Moonscoop gave this show a more anime look to it. It's really colorful with a blend of 2-D digital animation with 3-D digital animation. Another thing is its' humor which is spot-on with the comics. Other Marvel alumni make an appearance such as: The Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron Man, The Sub-Mariner, and more.

The 26 episodes include nine episodes never broadcast in America and are arranged in the order that they were meant to be shown. Episodes include: audio commentary, three featurettes(""From Origins To Animation"",""Rise Of The Rogues"", ""Traveling To New Dimensions"") which deal with the origins of the FF-Various FF Villains-the show's design and animation process and more.

I definitely enjoyed the skrull and Accuser story arcs that spanned several episodes in that volume. I decided that it warranted another look, and I wasn't disappointed. The writing is witty and memorable, and it was with the outside chance of seeing the frightful four, that I wanted to get this one, thinking that the zombie four might make an appearance. Still, even though Galactus is missing, this is probably Marvel's best animated product yet - the animation is simply superb - like a good penciler.",1224460800,,693,4.783333333333333
3375020,5,B00157OI9Q,"Ok, so maybe its not the worlds greatest cartoon about heroes, but this box set is pretty amazing still. I was VERY skeptical about this series when it started airing on TV. I didn't fall in love with the look right away. I hated the movies and this seemed to be based off of the movie version of the team. Things were not looking good for the latest animated FF. Then something happened that changed how I felt completely: I watched the show. IT'S AWESOME! The animation is great. The character design totally works. The voice acting really suits the characters and the animation is beautiful. I watched one of these DVDs recently on a friends MAC and it looked even better! The colors and clarity really leaped out on a higher definition television. But back to the boxed set:

This set contains over 20 episodes. Most of the major FF villians are featured and even some heroes make appearances on a few episodes. Marvel comics fans will be happy to learn that the main producers of the show are Craig Kyle and Chris Yost. These guys have a huge love for the Marvel U and really treat the FF with respect. You can tell that it's comics fans who are writing the stories and not some disinterested Hollywood writer who's just getting handed a check. There are some visual elements put in there just for the fans, even if they have nothing to do with the episode plot-wise. Little touches like that were some of what really drew me into the show.

I've read some bad reviews for this series and I really couldn't disagree more. This series is wonderful, funny, exciting and just gets better and better as the episodes go on. I was reluctant to give this a shot, but I'm so glad that I did. Any fans of the Fantastic Four comics or movies should definitely own this. Fans of superhero animation should get a copy as well. This is a series that I will definitely watch again and again. My only fear is that there may not be a season 2...",1219795200,,1934,4.429775280898877
3375021,5,B00157OI9Q,"If you're a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four, it's hard not to be judgmental when you first catch a peep of this show. But if you can get past the retooled character and costume designs (for the FF and their villains), and Reed's unruly mop of hair and Johnny's anime-influenced spiky do, and that spray-painted ""4"" on Ben's chest - then you might get that this is a pretty good animated series. Or was, anyway, since it's been canned already.

FANTASTIC FOUR: WORLD'S GREATEST HEROES debuted in September 2006 on the Cartoon Network. For the curious ones, this happens to be the fourth television incarnation of Marvel's first superhero family, succeeding the 1967, 1978 (with H.E.R.B.I.E. taking over for the Torch), and the 1994 versions. It's the hippest and funniest TV adaptation yet.

The series captures the essence of these characters. I've always liked Reed Richards, but he's never been the ideal leading man. Here, he seems to be younger but as typically bland and henpecked (thanks, Sue), although at times his personality channels the hipper Ultimate Reed Richards. Johnny Storm, patterned after the live action film's version, has never been more brash and immature, but he grew on me, and there are many times when he landed me in the silly giggles. He and H.E.R.B.I.E. provide a lot of the humor. The ever-lovin' Thing is still a tragic monster, but big-hearted, as demonstrated in ""Contest of Champions."" Johnny's older sis, Susan, consistently plays the role of the grown-up in the team and makes a formidable second-in-command. I'm glad that H.E.R.B.I.E. is back in the mix. This time H.E.R.B.I.E. is the self-aware computer system which Reed constructs to help run the Baxter Building. I dig how persistently cheerful and neurotic this new incarnation of H.E.R.B.I.E. is.

The mythos and spirit of the FF are well translated onto the screen. The sci-fi backdrop. Reed's futuristic gadgets. The classic and complex supervillains. The FF's constant family bickerings and infighting. As per norm, Reed's powerhouse intellect and scientific curiosity dictate that the team, besides holding down that saving the world gig, also acts as part-time explorers. As such, the foursome frequently end up in peculiar environments, whether it's the Microverse, the Negative Zone, on a different planet, or even in an alternate timeline. The Fantastic Four have always been adventurers on an epic scale. Mining from the FF mythos, quite a few of the episodes here are inspired by classic FF stories from the comic book (the FF getting evicted, Reed and Doom trading bodies, the Baxter Building being launched into space, the coming of Terminus, etc.).

The scattershot TV scheduling never gave the show a chance to build a loyal following. In my case, the sporadic airing left me lukewarm and even feeling critical of the episodes, and of the changes effected. But, now, having just seen the entire run on this box set, I've come around 180. After steady viewing, the continuity and cohesiveness of the show are more readily discerned, despite that the stories tended to be episodic. Past events are recalled in later episodes. Torch's fear of water is revisited a number of times. The Baxter Building tenants have recurring appearances.

As done by the French-based animation house, Moonscoop, the animation is crazy bananas - a cool, fairly smooth integration of 2D and CG, and rendered with lush and vivid colors. Everything looks great - the FF certainly, but also the revamped classic villains. And the background details are exquisite stuff! The city landscape, for example, is impressively depicted time and again. The ""Annihilate"" episode, in particular, showcases some stunning visuals. And, the stuff's presented in anamorphic widescreen. Also, I don't want to leave out the episode title cards, which struck me as cool and arresting visuals. The theme song, however, is dang weak.

Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes: The Complete First Season, in four discs, collects all 26 episodes, quite a few of which never got a chance to be aired. This terrific looking box set offers these bonus features: audio commentaries by Head Writer Chris Yost and Exec Producer Craig Kyle on 3 episodes: ""My Neighbor Was A Skrull,"" ""Contest of Champions,"" and ""Scavenger Hunt""; ""From Origin to Animation"" (18 minutes long) tracks the FF's conception and evolution and includes an interview with Stan Lee; ""Rise of the Rogues"" (9 minutes) covers the FF's classic villains (again, with Stan Lee); ""Traveling to New Dimensions"" focuses on the animation work and features interviews with the Moonscoop crew; four art galleries, including one showcasing some classic FF comic book covers; and even a miniature comic book reprinting Ultimate Fantastic Four #1.

The surface tweaks might be disconcerting at first, but, trust me, just roll with them. You'll find that this is the quintessential Fantastic Four. The same dysfunctional team, the same family of superheroes. Ben's self-loathing as a monster, Ben and Johnny's non-stop teasing and pranking, the classic supervillains, all these bring a retro feel to the show, hearkening back to when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were doing the honors on the World's Greatest Magazine. And, really, when was the Fantastic Four franchise ever better than when those two old coots were running it?

- Episode 1 - ""Doomsday"" - Dissension fractures the team as the media accuses Reed of having deliberately exposed Sue, Ben, and Johnny to cosmic rays on their fateful space mission.
- Episode 2 - ""Molehattan""  - When Manhattan highrises begin to sink underground, it could only mean the work of the Mole Man. And, this time, Ol' Moley wants Ben to join his side.
- Episode 3- ""Trial by Fire"" - Johnny Storm is charged with high crimes against the intergalactic Kree Empire. Johnny's trial lawyer? Reed Richards.

- Episode 5 - ""Puppet Master"" - A segment of the space station in which the FF originally got their powers crashes onto a beach and irradiates the sculpting clay of Alicia Masters's disturbed step-father.
- Episode 6 - ""Zoned Out"" - When a portal to the Negative Zone is opened, bug creatures drawn to energy invade the Baxter Building. This couldn't be a worse time for a tenants' meeting to be held.
- Episode 7 - ""Hard Knocks"" - Two words: ""Hulk smash!""
- Episode 8 - ""My Neighbor Was A Skrull"" - Wonderful episode. The Baxter Building suffers a systems breakdown even as the F.F.'s neighbors get all weird; H.E.R.B.I.E. begins speaking in Spanish: ""El gato es muy macho.""
- Episode 9 - ""World's Tiniest Heroes"" - A lab mishap causes the team to drastically shrink; guest-starring Ant Man.

- Episode 13 - ""Annihilation"" - The FF are whooshed thru a mysterious sphere and into the Negative Zone, where their powers are drastically boosted. Oh, and they meet Annihilus... and an old foe.
- Episode 14 - ""Revenge of the Skrulls"" - The Skrulls are back, bringing with them the Super Skrull (who boasts all of the F.F.'s powers), but their scheme is thwarted by the F.F. - and some nerd named Rupert, who won Susan's ""Be A Fantastic Fifth for a Day"" contest.

3375022,4,B00157OI9Q,"Fantastic Four:  World's Greatest Heroes is the fourth animated TV series for Marvel Comics's flagship title.  Premiering on the Cartoon Network the show has had a bit of a spotty broadcast history but now you can see the complete first season, including several unaired episodes, in this set just released by Fox Home Video.

Now a word of warning, while the series is largely faithful in idea to the comics, this is a re-imagining of the characters and they are given a more 21st century look.  This results in both good and bad.  The updated looks are just fine and who really wants to see Sue Storm with a bouffant hairdo anyway?  The only exception is Johnny Storm who looks like he belongs in a Dragon Ball Z cartoon rather than the Fantastic Fantastic Four.  Ughh!  Just horrible!  It doesn't end with Johnny's/The Human Torch's look.  His character absolutely annoying.  Even a teenaged Johnny Story was never this obnoxious in the comics.  After a few episodes his personality begins to grate on you.

Reed Richard's personality and voice acting (Hiro Kanagawa) is also week.  Reed sounds like a frat boy nerd who lacks confidence, almost the opposite of the analytical, often emotionally stunted scientist from the comics.  On the other hand, The Invisible Girl and the Thing are done quite well.  Admittedly, it's not hard to do Ben Grimm buy Brian Dobson nails him as well as you can.  Lisa Gilchrist gives us a Sue Storm who is more forceful and self-assured.  With a nod to the animated show of the 70s, there's even a return of H.E.R.B.I.E, this time as the F.F.'s super-computer.

As far as the stories goes, this series has the most dynamic array of villains and guest stars in any FF cartoon series yet.  Thankfully it's not all about battling arch-nemesis Dr. Doom over and over.  Besides Doom, the roster of villains includes The Skrulls, The Mole Man. Puppet Master, the Super-Skrull, Annihilus, Terminus, Diablo, The Frightful Four, Attuma, and Ronan the Accuser.  Guest-stars feature The Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and the Submariner.  Alas, however, there is no Silver Surfer or Galactus in the first season episodes.

Then animation is produced by the French company Moonscoop, best known for the Code Lyoko series, also broadcast on the Cartoon Network.  Like that show, the Fantastic Four combines traditional 2D animation with 3D CGI animation with a distinct, but not overwhelming, anime look.  This is a nice change of pace from the more cartoony look of shows like The Teen Titans.  The 3D allows for better visual effects.  It was noted in one of the featurettes that Moonscoop originally wanted to give Sue Storm pink hair and thankfully Marvel nixed that idea.  Those crazy French!

Even though the series doesn't faithfully adapt any comic stories they do come reasonably close.

""Trial by Fire"" stars the villainous Kree Accuser Ronan, who puts Johnny on trial after the Torch destroys several Kree probes.  This is a loose adaptation of Fantastic Four #65 Vol. 1.

""Revenge of the Skrulls"" features the Super-Skrull, a Skrull augmented with the powers of all four members of the F.F.

""World's Tiniest Heroes"" finds the team shrinking due to an experiment of Reed's gone haywire.  The episode guest-stars the Hank Pym version of Ant Man and is based on a story appearing in Fantastic Four #16, Vol. 1.

There are guest-stars aplenty in the show:  The Hulk and the Thing have one of their classic battles in ""Hard Knocks"" The Sub-Mariner shows up a couple of times, and Iron Man helps the team battle several sets of his armor that has been taken over by Dr. Doom.

The writers did a good job of capturing the spirit of the comic, particularly the first volume but with a modern sensibility and pizzazz.  They missed the boat, though, by omitting the Silver Surfer and Galactus, which is arguably one of the most famous story arcs in Marvel history.",1219363200,4,3893,4.832072617246596
3375023,5,B00157OI9Q,"This show is what the new ""The Batman"" series is to the '90s Batman:TAS.  The animation, while having a very slight anime look to it regarding the characters, and the CG effects are a seemless blend into the traditional 2D cell animation.  What I mean by that is that the CG is used to give some of the environmental landscapes and vehicles a true 3D look.  What I really like about the vehicles, especially the everyday civilian vehicles, is that they're modeled after real-world cars.  The Taxis and Police cars of NYC are Ford Crown Vics, and in several scenes you can pick out the new Chrysler 300Cs.  In the Puppet Master episode, his original vehicle was a early 2000s Chevy S10, and I think I even saw a new Chevy Colorado truck in NYC.  All of these are modeled in 3D.  I mention all this, because in most animated series, the cars are generic shapes that do not resemble any real-life cars.  I just thought that was a nice touch in this series.  It may date the show in the long run, but it's cool now.

Oh, one more thing...the New York city scapes.  Fully rendered in 3D and fully textured.  So no generic half-animated city scapes in this series.  Something most other cartoons do to save money.  But since these are modeled in 3D, its easy to show them in every scene necessary.

Now as for the stories, yeah, I agree with trashcanman.  There's a bit of a departure from classic comic book story arcs, but so what?  The humor thrown in makes up for it.  And it's a smart humor too.  Not too childish.  In fact, it reminds me alot of the characterizations used in the two feature films.  The Johnny Storm in these series is modeled almost exactly like Chris Evans in the films.

Sound quality on these discs?  Fantastic!  No pun intended.  5.1 surround mix that is really active and very directional.  Rear channels are put to good use for special effects and all.  Picture quality?  Good too...16x9 anamorphic transfer.  My only complaint is that the show's contrast levels are a bit high.

UPDATE:  Now that I've had a chance to view the entire set, I must say that this is the best animated superhero series since the DCAU ""Justice League"" series.  The banter between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm is extremely clever for an animated show.  And then you have Susan Storm acting as the surrogate mother to the whole team, especially when she tries to reel back Reed Richards to reality when he goes off on some techno-babble when explaining a relatively simple endenture.

The only thing that I was disappointed with is that there were no episodes dedicated to the Silver Surfer and Galactus story.  I mean how can you do a Fantastic Four show with no Silver Surfer stories?  And I guess I'm also a bit disappointed in that the ""special power"" effects weren't CG enough, unlike Justice League.  However those episodes that had cross-over superhero appearances, like The Hulk, Iron-Man, She-Hulk, and Namor, were quite good.  Even the one with the villians Frightful Four was great.  Nice take on the classic Klaw character.  (I remember my cousin having a Klaw figure back in the early '80s.)

Anyway, I have been totally impressed with this series.  It totally surprised me.  It just goes to show you that don't base a show on preliminary character art designs.",1213142400,9,3273,4.619130434782608
3375024,5,B00157OI9Q,"Let's get one thing straight, this is not a FF series for old-school Marvel fanboys; the kind who complain that an adaptation is cheesy if it is 100% faithful to the original material but go ballistic if they change anything from the comic. I know you know who I'm talking about. This series is a fresh reinvention of the superheroes we know and love and personally I enjoyed it. A lot.

The animation is certainly above average for a cartoon; it's not exactly Pixar, but it's far superior to the more traditional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B0007US7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four - The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;with it's horrible theme song. The look is a uniquely modern mix of eastern and western styles with some nice CG, all of which may be off-putting to those who just want an animated version of a forty year-old comic book (that's already been done...twice) but it works nonetheless. The series' best attribute by far is it's sharp sense of humor. For example, in one episode Dr. Doom manages to switch bodies with Reed Richards after imprisoning himself. Reed, in Doom's fully armored body, escapes and hails a cab. As he sits down in the back of the taxi, the driver eyes him for a second before commenting, ""Hey, you're that Iron Man guy, ain't ya?"". Reed/Doom -rather than explain the insane situation- simply looks at him and responds, ""Yes. Yes I am."". Great stuff, but if the notion of poking fun at classic comic characters is sacrilegious to you, skip this show. Johnny Storm's obnoxious insistence that everyone call Annihilus ""The Annihilator!"" as if he was a professional wrestler won't earn him any fans among the overly earnest Marvel old guard of fandom. But his Doom impression is laugh-out-loud hilarious.

As with all Marvel animated series, this one's got it's share of guest stars including  Iron Man, Ant Man, the Hulk (note to self: don't make fun of his momma), The Sub-Mariner, and more so three cheers for that. The series is episodic so there are no continuous arcs to follow, each show is a twenty minute story full of humorous situations, cool action scenes, and new interpretations of classic villains (the episode where the Skrulls disguise themselves as the FF's neighbors and ask them bizarre questions about their powers/weaknesses is another fun one).  There are recurring characters and call-backs to previous episodes, but the stories themselves are self-contained.  Nice and simple.

While the early 90's animated series was much more faithful to the comic, the animation has not aged well and the early episodes are nearly as cheesy at times as the unwatchable 60's incarnation.  It's a superior show for fans of the comic that improved greatly as it went on, but there is a lot more to like about this incarnation if you can get over the lack of faithfulness to the source material.  This is the FF at their funnest.
Anybody who prefers the older version has probably repressed the memory of Johnny Storm rapping (""flame on and on and on...).

I'm extremely pleased that Marvel has given us this series and NOT based it on the films; and even more so that they have released a full season boxed set.  Sure, they milked some of you with a few single-disc releases first, but for those of you (like me) who crossed their fingers and hoped, here it is: Season One of ""Fantastic Four- World's Greatest Heroes"" complete with NINE unaired episodes, cool featurettes and commentaries, and even an art gallery.  Even the packaging is top notch.  I am well-pleased with this set.  I rate it 4 1/2 stars rounded up for successfully taking on the very difficult task of reinventing one of the last generation's flagship titles.  Enjoy.  Now, for the umpteenth time: Marvel, will you PLEASE release the 90's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B00004Y56F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B0007RT9MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B00005JODV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Hulk/dp/B000089G5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Hulk</a>&nbsp;series' in their entirety?!

3375045,3,B00157OI9Q,"The Fantastic Four are a classic superhero team, but this show doesn't do them justice. Its not a bad show, but it could have been more. The designs are ok, but aren't that impressive. The animation is pretty good, though. The characters are done decently, although Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman have barely any relationship, which is really weird coming into it as a fan of the comic, where they've been married since literally before I was born. Its also not a good change. Reed and Sue's interactions in this cartoon always feel off. They're not quite just friends, but obviously not together. It makes the team dynamic feel weird. The Thing and Human Torch feel similar to the comic versions, although Johnny is probably a bit too stupid at times in the cartoon.

The show has a decent collection of villains and guest stars. Dr. Doom is pretty good in all of his appearances, and he's the best villain in the show. There are also a few guest appearances by other Marvel heroes like Ant-Man and She-Hulk (the episode with She-Hulk is my personal favorite for this series). Overall, the writing for the show is average to ok. I wasn't blown away by much, but I rarely hated an episode. This is a firmly middle of the road show, with some good things but a lot of problems. I'd reccomend it to fans of superhero shows, but I'd make sure FF fans in particular didn't have high expectations. If you want a decent superhero show to pass the time, this is probably worth it.

The plots are good science fiction fun with some stories borrowed from the original comic stories and others seeming to go into new directions. The show had a good amount of drama and humor, and some decent action without being too frantic. They managed to capture the group's sense of family.

The only real negative to this series is that Johnny Storm is a bit of a jerk which is something they borrowed from the 2005 movie along with the appearance of Alicia Masters. Though actually, this was better than either of the those films.

It's fun seeing the rivalary between human touch and grim with much sillyness.  The storys are good for both young and older audiences, where older cartoons tended to be a little more kid sentric.

I loved ""X-men: Evolution,"" and ""The Batman,"" and though i was opposed to it I've grown to like ""Iron Man Armored Adventures."" I mention these because they made major changes to the mythology while staying true to the source material. ""FF World's Greatest Super Heroes"" does much of the same. Heavily influenced by the live action films and the Ultimate take on the characters, the Fantastic Four here are hipper, and cooler than ever put om the screen before. Sure Reed is still a super genius, but now he has a sense of humor, and fun. Sue is a stronger more independant Invisible Woman, and Ben Grimm is the Thing. Not much ever changes about him. Johnny is the comic relief along with Ben and their brotherly relationship is the main set up for a lot of laughs.

I said this takes hints from the movie, and the African-American Alcia Masters is proof, which gives us a African-American Puppet Master. All of the villains have had an update either to their looks or origins, and yet still feel classic. Doom, looks pretty cool, and the Mole man was actually done pretty well. Rona, the Accuser, Super Skrull, and The Impossible man all pop up. And speaking of popping up, there is no shortage of guest spots with Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron man, Namor, and even Ant Man showing up. This may be a different take on the franchise but it was well done and fun!",1327968000,,1518,4.460431654676259
3375060,5,B00157OI9Q,"I didn't expect much with all the Marvel reboots that I have seen.  I was surprised to see that it was a great re-telling of the FF mythology. If you like the traditional FF with Johnny Storm, this series is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  It restructures many of the original first year FF adventures from 1962 with a modern twist.  I did like the portrayal of Reed Richards as the lead character. The actor who voices him sounds more like a real person; more so than the one in the 1994 version. It looks like they actually cared about what the fans think in this adaptation. Even if it did run for only one season, I don't remember a second, it's the FF at it's best.

The Human Torch comes across as the biggest, most immature a--hole in the history of comic book heroes but other than that this series is great. All the Fantastic 4's biggest enemies are here including Dr. Doom, The Skrulls, The Kree, Annihilus, and some lesser villains like Mole Man & Impossible Man. It also features great guest appearances from The Hulk, Iron Man and Namor the Submariner. And other than REALLY going out of the way to make Human Torch an unlikeable ass, this series really catches the functioning dysfunctional family life of the 4 like in Marvel Comics more than in the previous 3 TV series.

3375063,4,B00157OI9Q,"I got this DVD set for Christmas one year.  I'd liked the old 90's cartoon, even if it was campy, but I'd never seen this one.  I'm struck that they tried to make it a little to anime like for my tastes.  I liked most of the animations, but for some reason their version of Doom didn't do it for me.

My biggest annoyance was lack of cute outfits for Sue.  Yeah, perverted or not I do like the cartoon super heroines to dress a little cuter.  She only shows some leg in a few rare scenes and only briefly.  It's almost like they went out of their way to not show any.  Even when the She Hulk visits, there's only maybe a few seconds of the human form in her swimsuit type outfit.  Bummer.  If you like a little more skin, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Unlimited/dp/B000GYI33Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League Unlimited</a>.

Dialog was good, animation good, and stories overall were good.  There are a few weaker episodes, but that's to be expected in any TV series.  I especially loved the Skrulls, who were by far my favorite villains, but they only got two or three appearances.

At 26 episodes, for the price Amazon is charging now, the series is an especially good deal.  It cost $30 when I received it and I'd have bought it myself at that price.  It's a pity it didn't make a second season.  It was one of the good ones.",1278979200,3,1400,4.7190082644628095

There are alot of other Marvel heroes that make guest appearances such as Hulk, Iron Man, Ant Man, She-Hulk, but the best is Namor the Sub-Mariner.  ""Imperius Rex"" and ""Atlantis Attacks"" were two of my favorite episodes and both have the Sub-Mariner.  The epidsode ""Hard Knocks"" featured a knock down drag out with the Hulk which is my sons favorite episode.

The voice actors and the way they animated the four really do capture the essence of the characters as was intended by Smilin' Stan and the King.  I especially love the way Johnny (Human Torch) is portrayed especially when he screams like a little girl, hilarious!

The story appears to be a continuation from the Fox motion picture because Doom is with the four during their foray into cosmic rays.  This is all presented during the opening credits which by the way features a catchy little techno riff that really grows on you.  So pick this up and you won't be disapointed I promise.

3375067,4,B00157OI9Q,"To be honest, I've been a casual Fantastic Four fan most of my life. Picking up an issue here or there is usually how I'd catch up with what was going on in their comic. There were other Marvel characters that I had more of a connection with, sadly. Thanks to my fascination with animation over the last year and the fact that I needed a good 'Superhero' fix, I decided to get the complete first season of Fantastic Four:World's Greatest Heroes. The show itself is about a group of superheroes that gain their powers after cosmic ray exposure. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is a scientist who can stretch his body like a rubber band. Ben Grimm (The Thing) is super strong and almost indestructible. Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman) can turn invisible and create force fields at will while her somewhat younger brother Johnny (The Human Torch) can manipulate fire at will. What sets this show apart from other incarnations of the Fantastic Four is the look of the show. Moonscoop gave this show a more anime look to it. It's really colorful with a blend of 2-D digital animation with 3-D digital animation. Another thing is its' humor which is spot-on with the comics. Other Marvel alumni make an appearance such as: The Hulk, She-Hulk, Iron Man, The Sub-Mariner, and more.

The 26 episodes include nine episodes never broadcast in America and are arranged in the order that they were meant to be shown. Episodes include: audio commentary, three featurettes(""From Origins To Animation"",""Rise Of The Rogues"", ""Traveling To New Dimensions"") which deal with the origins of the FF-Various FF Villains-the show's design and animation process and more.

8257677,5,B00157OI9Q,"If you're a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four, it's hard not to be judgmental when you first catch a peep of this show. But if you can get past the retooled character and costume designs (for the FF and their villains), and Reed's unruly mop of hair and Johnny's anime-influenced spiky do, and that spray-painted ""4"" on Ben's chest - then you might get that this is a pretty good animated series.

FANTASTIC FOUR: WORLD'S GREATEST HEROES debuted in September 2006 on the Cartoon Network. For the curious ones, this happens to be the fourth television incarnation of Marvel's first superhero family, succeeding the 1967, 1978 (with H.E.R.B.I.E. taking over for the Torch), and the 1994 versions. It's the hippest and funniest TV adaptation yet.

The series captures the essence of these characters. I've always liked Reed Richards, but he's never been the ideal leading man. Here, he seems to be younger but as typically bland and henpecked (thanks, Sue), although at times his personality channels the hipper Ultimate Reed Richards. Johnny Storm, patterned after the live action film's version, has never been more brash and immature, but he grew on me, and there are many times when he landed me in the silly giggles. He and H.E.R.B.I.E. provide a lot of the humor. The ever-lovin' Thing is still a tragic monster, but big-hearted, as demonstrated in ""Contest of Champions."" Johnny's older sis, Susan, consistently plays the role of the grown-up in the team and makes a formidable second-in-command. I'm glad that H.E.R.B.I.E. is back in the mix. This time H.E.R.B.I.E. is the self-aware computer system which Reed constructs to help run the Baxter Building. I dig how persistently cheerful and neurotic this new incarnation of H.E.R.B.I.E. is.

The mythos and spirit of the FF are well translated onto the screen. The sci-fi backdrop. Reed's futuristic gadgets. The classic and complex supervillains. The FF's constant family bickerings and infighting. As per norm, Reed's powerhouse intellect and scientific curiosity dictate that the team, besides holding down that saving the world gig, also acts as part-time explorers. As such, the foursome frequently end up in peculiar environments, whether it's the Microverse, the Negative Zone, on a different planet, or even in an alternate timeline. The Fantastic Four have always been adventurers on an epic scale. Mining from the FF mythos, quite a few of the episodes here are inspired by classic FF stories from the comic book (the FF getting evicted, Reed and Doom trading bodies, the Baxter Building being launched into space, the coming of Terminus, etc.).

The scattershot TV scheduling never gave the show a chance to build a loyal following. In my case, the sporadic airing left me lukewarm and even feeling critical of the episodes, and of the changes effected. But, having seen the entire run on this box set, I've come around 180. After steady viewing, the continuity and cohesiveness of the show are more readily discerned, despite that the stories tended to be episodic. Past events are recalled in later episodes. Torch's fear of water is revisited a number of times. The Baxter Building tenants have recurring appearances.

As done by the French-based animation house, Moonscoop, the animation is crazy bananas - a cool, fairly smooth integration of 2D and CG, and rendered with lush and vivid colors. Everything looks great - the FF certainly, but also the revamped classic villains. And the background details are exquisite stuff! The city landscape, for example, is impressively depicted time and again. The ""Annihilate"" episode, in particular, showcases some stunning visuals. And, the stuff's presented in anamorphic widescreen. Also, I don't want to leave out the episode title cards, which struck me as cool and arresting visuals. The theme song, however, is dang weak.

The surface tweaks may be disconcerting at first, but, trust me, just roll with them. You'll find that this is the quintessential Fantastic Four after all. The same dysfunctional team, the same family of superheroes. Ben's self-loathing as a monster, Ben and Johnny's non-stop teasing and pranking, the classic supervillains - all these bring a retro feel to the show, hearkening back to when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were doing big things, seminal things, in the World's Greatest Magazine. And, really, when was the Fantastic Four franchise ever better than when those two old coots were running it?

- Episode 1 - ""Doomsday"" - Dissension fractures the team as the media accuses Reed of having deliberately exposed Sue, Ben, and Johnny to cosmic rays on their fateful space mission.
- Episode 2 - ""Molehattan"" - When Manhattan highrises begin to sink underground, it could only mean the work of the Mole Man. And, this time, Ol' Moley wants Ben to join his side.
- Episode 3- ""Trial by Fire"" - Johnny Storm is charged with high crimes against the intergalactic Kree Empire. Johnny's trial lawyer? Reed Richards.
- Episode 4- ""Doomed"" - Doom's mind transference technology enables him to swap bodies with Reed. A camera crew follows Johnny around to film a ""day in the life"" segment.
- Episode 5 - ""Puppet Master"" - A segment of the space station in which the FF originally got their powers crashes onto a beach and irradiates the sculpting clay of Alicia Masters's disturbed step-father.
- Episode 6 - ""Zoned Out"" - When a portal to the Negative Zone is opened, bug creatures drawn to energy invade the Baxter Building. This couldn't be a worse time for a tenants' meeting to be held.
- Episode 7 - ""Hard Knocks"" - Two words: ""Hulk smash!""
- Episode 8 - ""My Neighbor Was A Skrull"" - Wonderful episode. The Baxter Building suffers a systems breakdown even as the F.F.'s neighbors get all weird; H.E.R.B.I.E. begins speaking in Spanish: ""El gato es muy macho.""
- Episode 9 - ""World's Tiniest Heroes"" - A lab mishap causes the team to drastically shrink; guest-starring Ant Man.
- Episode 10 - ""De-Mole-ition"" - While out in the streets of New York, engaging in family time, the FF are attacked by a giant monster which bursts from underneath. So much for family time.

- Episode 13 - ""Annihilation"" - The FF are whooshed thru a mysterious sphere and into the Negative Zone, where their powers are drastically boosted. Oh, and they meet Annihilus... and an old foe.
- Episode 14 - ""Revenge of the Skrulls"" - The Skrulls are back, bringing with them the Super Skrull (who boasts all of the F.F.'s powers), but their scheme is thwarted by the F.F. - and some nerd named Rupert, who won Susan's ""Be A Fantastic Fifth for a Day"" contest. Meanwhile, Ronan the Accuser seeks revenge against the Human Torch.
- Episode 15- ""Strings"" - The Fantastic Four are evicted from the Baxter Building. Now they have to get real jobs.
- Episode 16 - ""Imperius Rex"" - Namor the Sub-Mariner (and Prince of Atlantis) bars the human race from the world's oceans. And Johnny, who hates getting wet, gets wet.
- Episode 17 - ""Doomsday Plus One"" - At 4am, Doctor Doom takes over the Baxter Building and launches it into space; the tenants aren't happy with this.
- Episode 18 - ""The Cure"" - Reed reverts Ben back to before that fateful space launch, thus making him human again, but without his memories intact; guest-starring She-Hulk.
- Episode 19 - ""Frightful"" - Move over, Fantastic Four. There's a new superhero team in town - the Frightful Four.
- Episode 20 - ""Out of Time"" - Returning from a time travelling jaunt, the FF find that present-day New York is now ruled by Doctor Doom.
- Episode 21 - ""Atlantis Attacks"" - Having been forcefully deposed as monarch of Atlantis, Namor ascends to the surface world with a dire warning: the massive Atlantean army is on the attack (or as Ben says: ""It's, uh, a lot of fish guys."").
- Episode 22 - ""Shell games"" - Versions of the Iron Man armor attack the FF. H.E.R.B.I.E. fears he is about to be replaced.
- Episode 23 - ""Johnny Storm and the Potion of Fire"" - When Johnny is doused with Diablo's alchemy potion, it turns him kinda evil.
- Episode 24 - ""Contest of Champions"" - I really dug this one. The FF must compete in a contest against Ronan the Accuser, the Super-Skrull, Annihilus and the Impossible Man, with the fate of humanity at stake. Among the games selected: charades, scooter racing, and a spelling bee (Annihilus: ""Could you use that word in a sentence?"").
- Episode 25 - ""Doom's World Is Law"" - One of Doctor Doom's doombots gains sentience and is befriended by Ben.
- Episode 26 - ""Scavenger Hunt"" - Terminus, fearsome scourge of the universe, comes to scavenge the planet Earth.",1463961600,,8916,4.8618421052631575
