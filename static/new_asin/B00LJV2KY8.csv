It is more than worth the price and definitely worth the watch. If you are easily offended - steer clear. Other wise, get out the popcorn and sodas....",1518566400,,314,4.25
8666257,3,B00LJV2KY8,"From the beginning this movie hits you with potty mouth and potty humor. This may be o.k. or even desirable in British comedies. Here it was just down right crude. Even people that enjoy the versatility of English would cringe at the dialog and low-level comedy. The high-level comedy here was slapstick.

If you get past the crudery and ridiculous scenes, theres a standard formula that you will recognize at once. A sheepherder with a sense of humanity backs down from a Neanderthal confrontation with the gunslinger. His girlfriend finds this attitude not to her liking and departs from his company. Will he get over his loss? Or take it in his stride. Or will he change his ways and loses humanity as he strives to outselling the gunslingers?

Meanwhile back at the ranch a new girl shows up with a mysterious past. She seems to cotton to him and help them make his decisions.

You will have to watch the movie to find out what choices he makes and what results is of those choices.

As I stated originally one would have to have no discerning taste to be able to make it to the end of this film and find out what happens. However, on the upside there are a lot of great actors and you believe the parts that they play.",1511136000,,1223,4.446428571428571
