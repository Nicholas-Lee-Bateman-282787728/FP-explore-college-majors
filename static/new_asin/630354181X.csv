7849645,5,630354181X,"Great animation, characters, and voices, on par with Batman the animated series. I wish the second season was available on DVD as well.",1495584000,,135,4.913043478260869
7849646,4,630354181X,"As a perfect example of the fading years of the children's cartoon (animation's early years) old glory. Made back in the day by the Hearst group, it transports the Legendary Phantom beyond Lee Falk's time to a world on the brink of desolution. Now, the 23rd Phantom must fight for all this world and defeat those who would destroy it. Made in a French style, the story is told against this background.",1491350400,,401,4.583333333333333
7849647,5,630354181X,"This is a wonderful high bitrate collection of Phantom 2040, the first of two seasons. It has been a while since release, and I'm very disappointed to see that the second season is not yet available. The show looks amazing on 4 dual-layered DVDs. Unlike season 2 of TMNT, each video file is as high quality as DVD can offer.

I don't understand why cartoons are not yet released in a high definition format on blu-ray discs. Much anime is, and old, hand-drawn cartoons look amazing in HD. Much like Cyber C.O.P.S. and Captain Planet, we can expect season two to never be released by the same company as season 1, if at all. Hopefully another group will purchase the rights and release this series in its entirety. DIE DVD, DIE!

For those looking for a review of the series itself... Phantom 2040 is a darker, almost adult-oriented cartoon with deep plot lines and very powerful subject matter. Many episodes deal with concepts and emotions that would be impossible for children to relate to or even understand. The artistic value of this series is shocking. Just a couple stories include a biot that becomes self-aware, a dead man who realizes his own immortality, a boy that chooses to leave reality for an existence in cyberspace.",1470873600,3,1233,4.730232558139535
7849648,3,630354181X,"It had some flaws in the recording. Just about ten minutes of a sixty minute taping.  But other than that, it had good viewing.",1372809600,,127,4.291666666666667
7849649,5,630354181X,I really enjoy all of the Phantom 2040 films. I would recommend this video to those who enjoy fiction-animation films.,1363305600,,118,4.95
7849650,5,630354181X,"Excellent full-length animated feature in fact in my opinion the best Phantom incarnation to date. Featuring the talent's of Mark Hamill voicing Dr. Jax,Margot Kidder as evil Rebecca Madison and TV's Beauty & Beast  Ron Perlman the Phantom is voiced by Scott Valentine(Family Ties).  Animation,musical-score production values and story all top-notch. Story  goes Kit Walker discover's an ancient skull ring that leads him into the  strange jungle that he's been dreaming for week's. In this virtual African  wilderness he learns he is the 24th in a long line of 'Phantoms' over the  last 500yrs. Plenty of action and suspense Kit Walker(Phantom) must stop  Rebecca Madison's plans yo create a factory run by Biots,that will use-up  all of earth's resources. Not just strictly a movie for kid's,anyone whom  enjoy's animation should love this. Highly Recommended Viewing!",960940800,4,870,5.385185185185185
