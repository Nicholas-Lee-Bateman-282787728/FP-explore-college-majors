7760329,3,B01GIX5EOO,As a big fan of Scooby Doo who has seen every series and movie I have been disappointed in the choices Warner Bros has been making. The kiss movie and this one are both centered mostly on kiss and wrestling with Mystery Inc taking a back seat. With Warner Bros large list of  Classic pop culture characters why not choose some of them to team up with? Hopefully Warner will go back to the roots of Scooby and make some movies that center on the Scooby and the gang. While watching this we laughed at how weak some of the plot points were. If your a WWE fan this is for you if your a Scooby Fan you may be dissapointed.,1471132800,6,618,4.107438016528926

7760331,4,B01GIX5EOO,"I loved the DVD! It had a great storyline and did a great job incorporating Mystery Inc and what they are known for as well as WWE and wrestling. I was a little nervous that the wrestling aspect wouldn't really be incorporated in the movie and was happily suprised. I took a star away because I do not like the new voice of Velma. Bring back Mindy!!! She just suites the Velma character so much better. Also I do not like this ""jealous girlfriend"" attitude she has adapted. I know most view it as a ""jealous friend."" But to me it is so much stronger and weirder than just losing your beat friend. It needs to stop because they are ruining the Velma character that I love. But overall a solid movie. Really glad to add it to my collection. #ScoobyDooLoverForLife! Excited for the 2018 movie release.",1470960000,13,798,4.4353741496598635

7760333,4,B01GIX5EOO,"Movie was entertaining. Really enjoyed the WWE coming back. We just need Adam West to do a new Batman movie. Some bad parts, no Mindy Cohn and bad writing for Velma. One star less for that. Sorry to say Kate Micucci does not replace Mindy. It did not help that the writing for Velma made her a self conscious, snarky, whiner. As bad as the moon monster madness writing between Velma and Daphne.",1470700800,,394,4.410958904109589

7760336,5,B01GIX5EOO,"Remember your favorite meddling kids with a talking dog? And remember your favorite world wrestling superstars? YES!!! Scooby-Doo and WWE are teaming up once again!!! Ah, who could forget them...well, after their last time together? Anyway, let me give you a recap of their last crossover.
When our mystery-solving team decided to head on to WWE City 'cause Shag and Scooby won a victory-dance contest in a video-game and head on the road for a great adventure to meet our fav WWE superstars, including John Cena, Triple H, Sincaro, Kane, Sanito, The Miz, AJ Lee, and more. Even the CEO, Mr. McMahon. Look, it was a great movie. Right away, Shag and Scoob got themselves into a wrestling match with Kane after they were framed by Cookie for stealing the Championship belt, which was a fake and made of iron...and unmasking him who was actually the Ghost Bear, which was alright by me. But since our favorite WWE superstars and the crowd love them so much, I decided that it was crazy for this crossover to be great movie and all.

And now, our meddling mystery-solving team and the WWE superstars are back and teaming up once again, as Scooby and the gang joined forces with the returning superstars from the last movie, like Triple H, Mr. McMahon and now with the new superstars to join in like my favorite WWE diva, Paige, Sheamus, Lana, Rusev, and now their new partner, the Undertaker as they all tried to solve the next mystery involving a big race and the mysterious dreaded Speed Demon.",1468886400,8,1493,4.698473282442748

Now they are back to solve a racing mystery with wwe superstars triple h , the undertaker, paige,sheamus.

7760382,5,B01GIX5EOO,"This was a great Scooby Doo and WWE crossover!  There is a ""Demon"" who is trying to sabotage a race that the WWE Superstars are competing in, and the Undertaker's partner, Dusty Rhodes, is incapacitated.  So since Shaggy and Scooby are there, they fill in as the Undertaker's partners in his vehicle.  We have some great WWE appearances in this movie!  Triple H, Vince, Stephanie, Russev, Lana, The Miz (He made me laugh so hard with his antics!), Paige, Gold Dust, Star Dust, and some others.

We even get some wrestling moves as well!  We see the Undertaker's ""Last Ride,"" and his ""Tombstone Piledriver,"" the Miz's ""Figure 4 Leg-Lock,"" and we see Triple H in a pretty cool looking fight!

The animation is good, the fights are great, the voice acting is top notch, the jokes are funny, I loved it!  Any fan of WWE or Scooby Doo will really like this one.  Check it out!",1479168000,,871,4.532051282051282

7760398,3,B01GIX5EOO,"This movie was perfectly okay. I actually enjoyed it more than the first. I think if you had a plot similar to the previous movie with a villain more like the one from this movie and have characters from both in it (especially the Undertaker), and add more elaborate fight and wrestling match scenes, then you'd have the perfect Scooby-Doo/WWE crossover movie. As is, I still like both, with this one being my favorite of the two. One thing that sticks out the most from this movie over the other as stated before is that this one has the Undertaker (my favorite wrestler of all time). He talks in the same tone as he does on wrestling shows and usually does act like he usually would. But in this movie he sometimes says things and acts like I wouldn't expect him to. Sometimes he just seems a too... well, for lack of a better term, animated. Not surprising, though since his role was originally meant for Hulk Hogan (now there's a guy that gets animated). As for everything else, it's perfectly fine. The Scooby Gang is almost always enjoyable to see and the wrestlers are just as goofy and fun as ever. Also, the whole wrestlers doing EXTREME race car theme does sound like something a crackpot like Vine McMahon would think of *cough, cough, XFL, cough*. Overall, I can say this movie is in many ways an improvement over the original and I actually kind of want a third film to be made in hopes they will keep improving with these films(please bring Undertaker back, please).",1475280000,,1480,4.546816479400749

7760403,4,B01GIX5EOO,"This is the third animated movie under both WB animation & WWE Studios once again teaming WWE with cartoon icon Scooby Doo featuring various WWE personalities including The Undertaker, Triple H, Vince & Stephanie McMahon, Sheamus, Goldust & Stardust, The Miz, Paige, Los Matadores & El Torito, Rusev & Lana, Michael Cole, Kofi Kingston, and the late Dusty Rhodes.

Stephanie McMahon created a new off road racing league called the Muscle Moto Off Road Challenge comprised of WWE superstars competiting against each other in three different race cources over three days with the winning team getting a prize of $1 million with the teams comprised of Triple H & Stephanie in the Company Car; Sheamus, Goldust & Stardust in the Celtic Cruiser; Los Matadores & El Torito in the Pamplona Especial; Paige & Miz in the 2 Awesome; Rusev & Lana in the Moscow Express; and Dusty Rhodes & Undertaker in The Legendmobile.  Shaggy & Scooby are working the food truck at the event & while Thelma, Fred & Daphnie were in the audience only to witness a phantom racer named Inferno got involved sabotaging the race & injuring Dusty Rhodes causing Mr. McMahon to hire the gang once again to solve this mystery which also caused them to get directly involved in the race itself either as a mechanic or a racer themselves with Undertaker as everyone involved is dealing with various issues such as Mr. McMahon not wanting his daughter Stephanie to race, dissension between the racing partners themselves, producer Walter Qualls liking & encouraging more of the chaos for ratings, and Daphnie & Stephanie becoming closer friends indirectly effecting her friendship with Thelma.

DVD extras include a look at the Scooby Doo monster truck with two bonus television episodes: ""Monsters 101"" from Be Cool Scooby Doo & ""The Secret Of The Ghost Rig"" from Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated.

No different than the previous WWE/WB Animation movies, the WWE superstars are captured perfectly as far as their personalities go while still being able to have some fun with some characters that we wouldn't get in real life such as The Undertaker in situations & reactions that everyone knows we would never see his character do along with Goldust & Stardust actually being their usual ""cosmic"" characters but having no limits in this animation.

In the end, this was enjoyable overall as I watched it with my young son & he wanted to watch it again shortly after so I recommend.",1474588800,2,2444,4.922330097087379

7760405,1,B01GIX5EOO,"This movie was so bad, adding Scrappy Doo could have improved it! I have no use for what goes as TV wrestling these days. The first Scooby/WWE movie was a bit above *sucks*, the Flintstone/WWE movie was the epitome of *sucks*, and this is the first Scooby movie I have ever, in my life as a die-hard Scooby Fan from Day One, not finished. (I even finished ""Boo Brothers"", what used to be the worst Scooby movie of all time!) If you're going to use TV wrestlers, why didn't you use REAL TV wrestlers when you had the chance, like Dutch Savage and Andre the Giant. They were athletes AND entertainers, not a bunch of plastic, steroid-ed, posturing, long-winded braggarts like what today's ""wrestling"" has become. The movie was one boring promo after another by WWE ""wrestlers"". The gang and the mystery were put on a back burner; instead, we were bombarded by WWE poseurs bragging about what they're going to do. Then, in true WWE fashion, they do nothing but brag more. Geez Louise- if I craved that much hot air and inaction,  I could just watch Donald Trump!  Poor Scooby- it's not your fault. I still love you and the gang. But you need better management before they run you into the ground again. (See: Scappy Doo, Scooby Dumb).  PS~ I agree about bringing back the wonderful Mindy as Velma.

7760409,5,B01GIX5EOO,"I love everything Scooby- Doo, and I love that they made a second WWE movie so much! My favorite part about this movie is the dynamic between Scooby and Shaggy and The Undertaker. It's so endearing how much they love him but are afraid of him in person. If you watch WWE, you'll know that the Undertaker has a very serious and grim personality, completely the opposite of another fan favorite John Cena, who was featured in the last Scooby Doo/ WWE movie. It's funny to watch The Undertaker interact with our two favorite clowns, and brings back a lot of nostalgia for those of us who used to watch WWE back when The Undertaker was at his peak. I hope they make a third one with The Rock!",1474156800,4,688,4.341085271317829
7760410,5,B01GIX5EOO,We never seen WWE superstars as race car drivers and they did everyone justice. Also who would have thought that Triple H and Stephanie McMahon be the ones to destroy the race? All I can say is WOW!!!!,1474156800,,201,4.315789473684211
7760411,1,B01GIX5EOO,"Well, if you want to watch the Scooby gang sit and watch a car race, then don't miss this opportunity. Though Fred and I both slept through most of it. There were some weird problems with the movie for any Scooby Doo fan. The movie was not about the Scooby gang in the least. For some of the movie they 'go along for the ride' but that's really all. It's a movie about the guest stars, which I would think would have to interact a little more to have a better joint undertaking. There are also numerous wrestling characters involved, so introducing each and giving them something to do makes the story spread a little thin and come off as erratic. There's a lot of catch phrase usage, maybe the only Spanish word the wrestlers knew was ""Ole,"" but there was not much story or much dialogue. If you went into this caring about both topics, then you'll be disappointed because the Scooby half is severely underrepresented. I don't know where Velma's voice actress went or if she plans to return, but I hoped that she was merely protesting the script with her absence.
I think whatever contract they made with the wrestling franchise included a clause that stipulated the word ""Superstar"" in reference to the wrestlers be used a certain amount of times. No matter how many times someone insists that they are awesome I'd still make up my own mind, and it sounds like they protest too much. The wrestler who uses the ""bell tolls"" catch line must really be a fan of John Donne. Perhaps he truly understands how mankind is linked.
My personal distaste for wrestling might not have been such an obstacle to enjoying the movie if it had been a better written story. I enjoyed the KISS Scooby movie despite not liking KISS. Basically this is a mash up of NASCAR and WWE wrestling - wrestlers racing cars and fighting as they do. Neither of these pursuits interest me much. There is an audience out there that is interested in these things. Not a problem, really, I could pass on this movie because I don't care about racing or wrestling, but here's why I think it's inappropriate. These entertainment forms are sort of the ""everyman""'s entertainment. So it's unnerving that there is a repetitive and obnoxious theme about the wealth of the actual owners of the wrestling franchise. It seems like a slap in the face to have someone mention more than once that entertaining this particular audience and selling them merchandise and making them pay for events has rocketed the owner's fortune into the billions. This objection could have nothing to do with the movie, except for the fact that it is part of the movie. The dollar amount is mentioned more than once. Everyone has to spend their money somewhere, on WWE wrestling tickets, t-shirts, action figures, ... Scooby movies. Guess I regret contributing to this particular cause. It's a bit like musicians waving fists full of dollars around in music videos, they're really addressing their fans saying, ""Thanks for buying my cd, do you like the new car I bought with your money?"" But I digress. There is no wit, there is no humor, there is no Scooby in this movie. I hope the joint venture between WWE and Warner has come to an end and that Scooby will emerge older and wiser from this experience. You can be modern without pandering (What's New Scooby-Doo? comes to mind).",1474070400,4,3316,4.650766609880749

7760422,3,B01GIX5EOO,"To me, this movie feels more like WWE stars do Wacky Races than a Scooby mystery.  Yes there's a 'mystery', but it takes a back seat to the WWE antics and racing action.  If you like that, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you're a Scooby mystery fan, I believe you'll be disappointed.  I didn't have high hopes for the original WWE and Scooby collaboration, but was pleasantly surprises and really enjoyed it.  Second time around, not so impressed.  This is better than some of the recent Scooby movies but still not very high on my overall favorites list.",1473033600,11,552,4.581632653061225

Meaning that both franchises are represented equally in this film which is a really nice change of pace from the first one. The comic relief of Goldust & Stardust is a thing of beauty. And the reveal at the end is one you don't see coming.,1471219200,,394,4.12987012987013

8763011,3,B01GIX5EOO,"Nicely animated movie, in keeping with the traditional drawn style of the show that is.  Personally I'm still hoping Warner will some day kick their DTV animations up to full fledged computer animation, like Disney's Tinker Bell.  At least the traditional animated style works a lot better for Scooby Doo than it does for their DC DTV offerings.  And the colors and contrast really pop on Blu-ray so much more than the over-compressed standard DVD that's included.  Featuring a few episodes from the various Scooby TV series as extras was a nice touch.",1521849600,,552,4.903225806451613
