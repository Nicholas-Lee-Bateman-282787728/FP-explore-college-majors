8425833,5,B004DP4N9C,"This is a gorgeous and exciting film, primarily focused on the experience and thrill of mountain biking, in many different settings. The narrator describes a biker's personal emotional journey through the culture and experience of biking, and the dynamic of a man's machine taking part in the essence of nature. The soundtrack as well lends itself to the immersive narrative and heightens the power of instinct and awe.

Containing no interviews, specifications, or historical dates, this is an artistic piece and a splendid show of innovative cinematography. I have no idea how certain shots were pulled off. I sincerely hope this studio continues to make adventuresome, pure, exhilarating pieces like this in the near future!",1387152000,2,727,5.321739130434783

8425835,5,B004DP4N9C,I'm not sure about you but there are a lot of Mtn. Bike films that are either really juvenile or just plain bad. This one is neither and it's a breath of fresh air to the genre. It perfectly marries the natural beauty of the outdoors and the exhilarating flow of the bike trail. With a great soundtrack behind it this film is absolutely enjoyable. Leave all the rest behind because these people are the real thing.,1340755200,2,414,4.3896103896103895
