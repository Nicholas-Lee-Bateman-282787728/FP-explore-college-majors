8033743,5,B0002WYS4U,"We are big fans of the series. I'm not sure why the owners of this series have made it difficult for Americans to buy it. We got hooked by watching series 11 and 12 on Netflix. It was annoying but I assumed that this was standard get you hooked on a series and then force you to buy the DVD's to feed your addiction. Well the owners of this series have a different scheme: get you hooked and then don't provide any way for you to see the remaining series. As it happens though, we bought this and it played on our setup. Windows Media Center running on Windows 7. I haven't tried it on DVD players or other computers. I don't normally give anything 5 stars but the revisits were great and totally unexpected on our part. And then it played on our system which was unexpected as well.",1508976000,,783,4.226666666666667
8033744,3,B0002WYS4U,"Love the show, DVD showed up sooner that I thought it would. But the DVD would not work on a DVD player. Downloaded VLC player on my computer to get it to play. Something to do with UK dvds not working on U.S. devices.",1497484800,,218,3.977272727272727
8033745,1,B0002WYS4U,When I attempted to play this disc as well as the others with the set my player informed me that the disc could not be played. Never had this problem before ; has anyone experienced similar problem? I saw several of these productions on Netflix which prompted these purchases and thought they were fantastic so truly disappointed that I could not get them to play .,1492300800,,365,4.545454545454546
8033746,5,B0002WYS4U,It doesn't matter which country you live in these DVD's are inspirational.  Kevin is fun and funny.,1413936000,2,99,4.823529411764706
