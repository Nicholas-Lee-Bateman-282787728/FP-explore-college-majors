7114121,5,B00W195VZC,"Have watched Series 1 & 2 in their entirety,and am now watching this series. Dr Blake continues to enchant me,enjoy the relationships amongst Lucien,Mrs Beazley,Mattie and Charlie,miss Superintendant Watson,but like his replacement,too. Everything just flows,other shows try to equal other more famous shows and fail to live up. This has been called Doc Martin Downunder,both great shows,but Doc is more comedy,whereas this is murder drama. Hoping to have Series 4 available soon.",1438905600,7,480,5.680555555555555

7114128,5,B00W195VZC,"I love this series. I've learned so much about Ballarat, Australia, and the issues of the day, such as the roles of men and women and the treatment of the aboriginal people. I highly recommend this remarkable, well-acted series. The ABC is not going to continue making it and there is a fan group Save the Dr. Blake Mysteries on Facebook. We have well over 14,000 signatues and need more. Please help us save the show by signing the petition found on that page. Thanks!",1498089600,,469,4.529411764705882

7114130,5,B00W195VZC,"Imagine, a small town, located in the USA. There, in an average home, a television/computer is broadcasting a show based on a small town, Ballarat, located in Australia. A town, much like anyone might choose to settle in to raise a family amidst the trials of everyday life. Set in an era, which gave the world a chance for a new start. Death, murders, yes! Relationships, drama, life changing events all filmed and portrayed with an eye for detail to the era. The Doctor Blake Mysteries drew me in like those of the grand lady, Agatha Christie, whose works set the standard to period mystery dramas. With each episode, I found myself to be not only a viewer, but, a participant in solving the mysteries. I felt to be a part of the good doctor's household, or a member of the town observing and anticipating the events as they unfolded. Each portrayal of the wonderful characters gives one the sense of belonging. Each episode challenges the mind and the hearts of its viewers. It seems I find myself in the company of others who would love to see this show continue. Like so many, I would humbly ask, you reconsider the demise of, Dr. Blake Mysteries. Far too seldom, does a show come along that unites the hearts and minds of people from all over the world... Although my voice is one, combined with many, I do hope, the powers that be will give our thoughts, consideration. Whatever the future holds for this show, I enjoyed every moment I escaped, to the town of Ballarat, with the good doctor and the residents! Respectfully, D Roberts  (Save The Doctor Blake Mysteries on Facebook has global members joined in the effort to help secure a new home for this well-made period drama. To date, there are 4 seasons/series aired with a 5th season and mini movie in production. However, it is the wish of the cast/crew/creator(from all reports) and definitely from the fanbase, for this show to continue and we hope to help achieve this.)",1498003200,,1936,4.644314868804665

7114139,5,B00W195VZC,"I have enjoyed all three seasons of this show. I understand that they were not renewed, which is too bad. This show is character-driven, well plotted, and the Australian environment in the 1950's is interesting. It's kind of like Foyle's War in that way. The entire three seasons are well worth your time.",1491782400,2,305,4.773584905660377

7114167,5,B00W195VZC,"This series is acted so welll that one can receive information  that describes how medicine was an important aspect of the legal system . Truth has been acted out here as the first genuine psychiatry was founded in Europe with legal matters that could only be described from a medical official. McLachian portrays these incidents in ways that depict he must have studied the script and has the ability to hold one's attention in ways that others's have also. Prime Suspect was an example of reality and I could name many others that bring the evolution of many results that  have taken place due to the economy, the struggles that faced people affected by our war torn countries. It is a shame that it is usually men that carry the burden of the social environment that forces them to earn livings in ways that , if one really thinks about this, it continues today. I have enjoyed Doctor Blake immensely and hope there will be future series made. The series is a good history lesson for our current lifestyles Not much has changed.
