7991471,3,B00009L4SV,"I did this workout for the first time today, and only used 5 pound weights.  I should have used heavier ones, as the workout is not as intense as I was expecting it to be.  As for Harris, I found him hilarious.  While some people may find him annoying, I thought his energy made the workout more fun.  And if you'll notice, the people in his class are frequently amused by his being so over the top.  I really need to know what he drinks in the morning.  I'd give this video 3 1/2 stars if I could.  I will use this video again, and there are some good exercises in it.",1189296000,,569,4.026785714285714
7991472,1,B00009L4SV,"This DVD has nice set of exercises, but Alan Harris does not let you concentrate because of his ridiculous encouragements and stupid jokes. Also, video operators show Alan Harris more than the people  performing exercises while he is just walking around and discourages them with his screaming voice. I am glad that I bought this DVD for just $1 at Target in the dollar isle.",1150243200,,375,4.769230769230769
7991473,3,B00009L4SV,"I am a real exercise video junkie and have over 30 different workouts in my collection just so I don't get bored and can use the workout or instructor I am in the mood for. I bought this DVD looking for a good weight workout to use in rotation. While I did find some of the exercises interesting and useful it really isn't what I thought it would be.

I found that the actual workout time on this video is much less than I thought it would be due to Harris's constant ""encouragement"" and it is virutually impossible to find any pattern to his counting out repetitions. I finally gave up and just went to my own count... so why bother with the video? The workout also isn't as complete as I had hoped. Other workout videos have more different exercises and work more muscle groups than this one does.

I don't know why some instructors feel like they need to constantly keep up the chatter to keep you working out. That may work in the regular classroom where you can change your patter form class to class but it gets really old when you have to listen to the same dialogue over and over again on a video just to get to the exercises. If Alan Harris would just shut up and count instead of offering his ""encouragement"" maybe he could stay on count.

Enough criticism...  in spite of all of the above, it is still a somewhat useful workout and I will occasionally still put it in my rotation. It does have some slightly different variations on some standard exercises that I think work the muscles in a slightly different way and keep things interesting. It is good not to get into a rut using the same moves over and over again.. so while I wouldn't actually recommend it for anyone serious about working out, it is a good alternate workout for lighter days and also, since it does have good explanations on how to properly do some of the exercises, it isn't bad for a beginner.

I did like the way his workout group included people of all ages and even some, like me, that aren't thin... I do sometimes get tired of all the skinny, perky young bodies on most workout videos.",1130371200,2,2075,4.365284974093265
