Thoroughly delightful entertainment and well worth watching.

3482849,5,B001B43IV2,"This is a great British crime/mystery series.  The murders are always bizarre and are committed amidst a fantasy present day English countryside that we all wish we lived in.  The plots are thick and get thicker and I am always pleased when I cannot guess the culprits, at least not too readily.  This series used to run on the Biography Channel but for some reason, they have decided to deprive us.",1224028800,14,399,4.591549295774648

3482852,5,B001B43IV2,"So many of our friends and family regret the decision of A & E and the Biography channels not to renew this classic British series.  It is pure escapism and deliciously photographed in the wonderful English countryside.  John Nettles is everyman's hard working police inspector - cynical, darkly humourous and wholly believable.  The cast and characters are comprised of true eccentrics (as only the Brits can be) and one never knows what lies around the next corner in one of the charming Midsomer Counties villages.  If anyone of the powers that be in the programing offices of any network are reading this, please reconsider returning Inspector Barnaby and his confreres to their rightful place on our side of the Pond.  They are sorely missed!",1221955200,61,747,4.991935483870968

3482930,5,B001B43IV2,"I love Midsomer Murders. my favorites are the earlier ones with Gavin Troy as Barnaby's partner and these later ones with Ben Jones as his partner; no so  happy with middle shows with Scott as his partner.
I especially enjoy The House in the Woods in which we first meet Constable Ben Jones and the creepy haunted house ""in the woods."" Overall, this is a great series and this is an excellent additon to the series. Of course, that is my opinion anyway. Enjoy crime shows? Enjoy british TV? Enjoy British tv mysteries? I think you'll enjoy this set without reservations.",1362182400,,570,4.643564356435643
3482931,5,B001B43IV2,"There's nothing like the British to make a great ""Who Done it"" series. Interesting characters set in a English countryside village and you'll never guess ""who did it"" until the end. Each episode has a whole different cast of characters and takes place in a small community with historic settings. Of course the wonderful John Nettles is the chief inspector along with a sidekick, other investigators  and his supportive family. After each episode you begin to feel you are part of a family.

3482955,3,B001B43IV2,"I've watched every episode so far, up to Dead Letters. The last couple of seasons have gone slowly downhill and with this season, I think it may have jumped the shark.

First of all, the shows have become so formulaic that it's almost laughable: three gruesome murders, a fourth stopped just in the nick of time, and all perpetrated by a crazed psychopath (usually a woman). The episodes almost all end in a ""summing up"" or retelling of the whole story, solving the mystery with facts we never knew about.

The violence has elevated as well -- there are far more gory shots of slit throats and stab wounds than I care for, and the murders are usually re-enacted in detail. For me, that's not entertaining or imaginative.

Worst of all for me is that no one is really likable. Barnaby has become one-note, his poor wife walks around like a zombie, he's on his third partner and this new one has no personality, and the residents of the beleaguered villages are so nasty and unpleasant that I don't care who dunnit or why!

I may slog through a few more episodes but I can't see myself visiting Midsomer very often.",1344988800,,1113,4.522388059701493
3482956,5,B001B43IV2,"All of the Midsomer Murder Series are absolutely wonderful! However I need to have them close-captioned or subtitled for the deaf or hearing impaired.  I happen be hearing impaired and NEED them so and I buy every British mystery as long as it is so presented.  I get very frustrated that a great many of my favorite shows are not SDH or CC and it would be a great service for the millions of your potential customers if these mysteries (Inspector Morse), Rosemary and Thyme,etc were sold in either of these ways.  Please do take this very seriously.",1270684800,,550,4.591836734693878

3482959,5,B001B43IV2,"Nobody can do detective or ghost stories like the British!
These series are great! No extreme graphic violence & great work in every possible way.
The characters are always likeable. Though I must say ""Troy"" was my favorite!

The sights in these series are breathtaking!
England is so beautiful.
And if you like Victorian houses , estates, or castles these series have plenty of the most beautiful in the world.
That's another thing nobody can build houses like the British . Absolutely beautiful works of art!

As a British fan I recommend these series. Each & every single one of these series is absolutely perfectly done.",1266883200,2,624,4.877358490566038
3482960,5,B001B43IV2,"Big changes in Set Eleven; relatively speaking of course.  Barnaby ditches the Rover in favor of a new baby Jag* and we bid goodbye to DS Scott.  This series hit a rough patch commencing with Set 7 and not just because the affable DS Troy left the show.  His replacement, Scott, never seemed to mesh with the carefully crafted ambience of the cast and tended to project an overall negativity to the scripts.  Ironically the first episode Scott appeared in was titled ""Bad Tidings"". The writers tried to add some tension between Barnaby and his new DS, but it didn't come off particularly well.  Scott remained the petulant and selfish ""bad boy"" always looking for a way back to his city job and never embracing the Midsomer environs.  Perhaps to compensate the writers injected an ill advised sense of modernity with fewer cast members per episode and more yuppy centered story lines.  Lot's of 3 series BMW's zipping around driven by generally unlikable characters had the show in danger of turning into an English Murder She Wrote.

All improved with this set as DC Ben Jones joins up in ""The House in the Woods"".  Scott is briefly mentioned by a clearly disgruntled Barnaby in the opening scenes, but there is no farewell episode to commemorate his leaving like we had with Troy in Series Seven (""The Green Man"").  Jones is an inspired synthesis of the two previous sidekicks; smarter than the former but more loyal and appreciative of his mentor than the latter.  Ambience returns as does larger casts of quirky town folk.  Essentially this set does much to restore the series to it's former glory, though I still feel the first three collections (US series 5, 1 and 2) are the best.  Not one to start with, but highly recommended for fans of this venerable series.

*  One can draw many humorous explanations at the expense of legendary Jaguar durability, but inexplicably the Jag in the first couple episodes is silver, while in the balance it's black.",1262217600,8,1958,4.7514792899408285
3482961,5,B001B43IV2,"The fictional county of Midsomer still has murder rates per capita are higher than Chicago, Detroit, and New Orleans combined. However, Barnaby is now joined by a new sidekick, Detective Constable Ben Jones (Jason Hughes).  Ben Jones will eventually earn a detective Sargent rank - but not yet. :-)

The pluses for this set are: this is still fiction, the scenery is still much better, there remains lot of tongue-in-cheek British humor, and John Nettles - an excellent actor and humorist. Jane Wymark, as Barnaby's wife, continues her great support role along with Laura Howard and Ben Jones.

If you like multiple who-dun-its woven within one story, the series is for you.  Since PBS stopped airing the series, my wife and I have a weekly Hercule Poirot/Midsomer Murders night every Sunday.",1259712000,,792,5.022900763358779

Nobody does murder mysteries better than British Television...but my heart belongs to DCI Barnaby and his DS or DC sidekicks...Due in part because he (JN)looks so much like my late father who was our local Chief of Police for 42 years and secondly..everyone in my family are police officers.  This series is done magnificently...from the music to the cinemetography to the outstanding story telling.

3483027,5,B001B43IV2,"Mysteries have been my television favorites since the days of Perry Mason! Seeing the British series through A & E and/or The Biography Channel has taught me that the English countryside and the dry British wit are perfectly  suited to an outstanding mystery. John Nettles is one of the best actors ever. In watching the man work, he becomes DSI Barnaby. The series was superb in every way. The series was smart, intelligent, and authentic. It always had side stories of interest. The Barnaby family, Cully's growing thespian career, and Joyce's interest in the arts made us care about the characters, especially Tom Barnaby. It was never easy figuring ""who did the dastardly deed,"" or if we were allowed to see who did it, it was pure fun seeing DSI Barnaby find his man (or woman). What a shame we don't get to see this particulary series any longer. Reruns would be better than nothing at all.

This series is so superb that it is difficult to give words to explain why it is so entertaining. It reminds me of the MI-5 series, but not quite so youth-and-technology-oriented. At least with our own sets of the shows, we can watch them over and enjoy them almost as much the second, or third, or fourth time. It gives one a great thrill to introduce the series to new mystery fans via the DVD's.",1226620800,4,1296,4.581896551724138
