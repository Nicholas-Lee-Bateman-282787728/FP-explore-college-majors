2269378,3,B00096S43K,"I hardly ever watch television, much less novelas. The only reason why I acquired this DVD was because a friend made a comment to me that made me want this. This is a REMAKE of the 1990 Televisa soap ""Teresa"", starring the then unknown Mexican beauty SALMA HAYEK. I have not seen this novela in years and was always a fan of it (and still am of Salma Hayek).

This is almost the same novela It's amazing how Televisa finds it necessary to re-hash their stories. But when is ""Teresa"" itself going to be released on DVD??? Do they not release their old soaps so they can rehash them to new audiences? People know the difference, believe me. People knew that ""Luz Clarita"" was a remake of ""Chispita"", that ""Salome"" was a remake of ""Colorina"" and recently that the novela starring Thalia's niece is a remake of ""Rosa Salvaje"". Why bother, Televisa? The main difference between ""Rubi"" and ""Teresa"" is that Teresa was much more calculative and relied on her tactics to get what she wanted...whilst Rubi relied on her looks and sex to get her way. The endings are different too.

But that being said, ""Rubi"" itself is a decent novela, but Barbara Mori is missing that fire and spark that Salma Hayek brought to the original. Sure she's gorgeous, no denying that. But her role wasn't believable as the calculating and money hungry social climber as she was supposed to be. This role was perfect for Salma and it's a shame this remake couldn't get a similiarly talented star. A pretty face isn't everything

I'm just waiting for them to release ""Teresa"" and all the classic Luca Mndez soaps.",1119398400,5,1582,4.622775800711744
2269379,5,B00096S43K,"Rubi was amazing on DVD. I have to admit I was a little iffy whether I should buy it because I have purchased other Novelas on DVD and didn't like them. I'm the first to admit, I was wrong. It has the whole show on it and it's not all chopped up either. It even has some extra footage and an alternative ending. I would strongly suggest this to any Rubi fan. The show was great and the DVD dosen't come far behind.",1114473600,33,414,4.0

The content was scrambled, and didn't seem to follow a specific timeline that the soap opera follows. The image quality was also painfully low.

What a huge disappointment!  The editing is horrible! It is so choppy and many of the lead up scenes that explain the next scene have been cut.  The beginning of the show isn't even there.  That's important because it shows how she meets everybody and how the relationships developed .Instead they show her in a love scene with Hector and that's how it starts.  Rubi's closest friend throughout the whole show, Loreto the gay designer who always carries his little chihuahua with matching outfits, is barely in the show compared to the original show.  He spent so much time plotting and planning with her and we don't see much of it.  The creator and the production team of this show would probably freak out if they saw this DVD!

2269443,1,B00096S43K,"Rubi (Rubi - 700 minutes)

This 2004 telenovela addresses family values, sexual obsession, mental illness and social attitudes about physical handicaps.

Rubi (Brbara Mori) is a ruthless gold-digger beginning in her envious teenage years. Her crippled best friend Maribel (Jacqueline Bracamonte) is wealthy, while she is NOT!

Follow Rubi into her gorgeous and tempestuous adulthood. She plays two handsome men, Hector and Alejandro (Sebstian Rulli and Eduardo Santamarina) against each other; she steals men like a shoplifter steals socks. Her mother and her sister are both well grounded in values, while she puts a price tag on everything, including her own body.

The extras include an updated episode where Rubi's niece, who is a blonde version of Rubi's younger self, gets the scoop from Rubi's long-time gay friend, who witnessed the whole saga. This is essential because the actual ending to the series was a cliff-hanger!

Unfortunately, the finale is also a cliff-hanger and the ending for the original 1968 version is different enough that it doesn't satisfy, either. Aarghhh!",1379289600,,1087,5.370588235294117

So much so, that at times it's difficult to keep up with what is happening. You will notice this especially if you compare an episode from the dvd with the ones featured on youtube. Of course the main scenes were not cut out, but it's always nice to see what happened prior to the big moments. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this product, but be aware of the many edits.

(I am from Germany, and the first few episodes were running on German TV ""RTL"" but then they were suddenly cancelled, but these episodes that they actually aired were un-cut.)

So I bought this DVD to see all of ""Rubi"". It's a pity it is cut. I'd like the un-cut version. I hope it will be released one day. I cannot get enough of ""Rubi"", my favourite telenovela.

I would have liked Spanish subtitles and German subtitles, in my case. Watch out: English subtitles only on this DVD! And the language the DVD's are in are Spanish.

By the way: if you'd like to see Rubi as an uncut version in German language, you can still watch it on ""rtlnow"" at the moment, too.
But it's very expensive, to view all the episodes there. I like Rubi's original voice better than the German synchronization.",1307836800,,897,4.4573170731707314

Lo que no me gusto fue que le sacaron el tema de Reyli, La Descarada y pusieron otro que se llama Mala Mujer, pero esta bien, dentro de todo, no es mala la cancion, pero no tiene la Original. Despues note que la Musicalizacion no es la misma que la de la Transmision Televisiva. Los Extras son Muy Buenos, Contiene Bloopers y El Especial de Rubi contado por su sobrina y Loreto, aunque la parte final queda inconclusa.

When the last one was to be shown, my cable service went out and I called customer service and explained that it was the last episode of Rubi, and the rep totally understood and had it fixed by 8 p.m.  My friends also whispered that they were hooked. So I jumped at the opportunity to order this DVD set. Unfortunatley, it came in a sealed package missing the first disk!  So I didn't see the early episodes and am still at a loss as to how the plot was set up. Nevertheless, Rubi is the Mexican telenovela at its finest. It has all the elements: hot, evil, manipulative beauties (Rubi); sweet, suffering, pious pretty virgins (Maribel); guys easily led by the you-know-whats by hot women (Alejandro); and handsome but sleazy business ""socios.""

Barbara Mori excels as Rubi and really brings her to life. She makes you hate her and want her at once. The supporting cast too is excellent, but Rubi is the star just like she would like it. One of the better telenovelas recently made, you will be hooked by the first episode.

But I really love the scene near the finale, when Aleandro tells Rubi he's in love with Maribel, and tells Rubi he's never going back to her ever. Rubi was overall very enjoyable for me . I really love Yadhira Carillo, she was awesome!",1152662400,,687,4.325581395348837

2269493,4,B00096S43K,"There are some shows that are great because they are meant for families, SCI FI fans, Western lovers, etc. Rubi is great because it is perfect at it's goal of pulling in the viewer and not letting go until the last Rubi-filled scene.

Barbara Mori is probably one of the most beautiful women God ever created and she fits well into her part as the vivacious Rubi. The ladies will have plenty of fun with the leading men as well. But this show is about Rubi, everyone else is mainly there to support her.

You do not need to understand Spanish to follow the plot. It is subtitled in English but that is not needed either really. The characters come off the screen and grab you and the story follows along well.

Rubi is a sinful treat that you will enjoy. I watched it with my wife and we had a ball. If Babrabra Mori needs a handsome Gringo for a stand-in I am available.",1141257600,12,871,4.266666666666667
2269494,3,B00096S43K,The novela Rubi in itself is excellent.  The theme was fascinating and the actors and actresses were fabulous.  With that said having the opportunity to purchase it and watch it while stationed overseas with no spanish channels is thrilling.  I am no expert in film but thought it was well put together and easy to follow even if some scenes of the TV version were missing.  Definitely a must watch for anyone interested in spanish soaps.,1140048000,,438,4.723684210526316
2269495,4,B00096S43K,After watching dvd I was a little disapointed. This a good story but when they were editing they missed a lot of the what makes the main character do the things she does. I used to watch the series. When Rubi moved to Cancun there were a lot of real good outdoor shots they cut out. There wasn't enough good shots of surporting characters. I mean were at the beach! I would like the bonus material to be a lot more interesting. I think the production company rushed to get it out. Too bad if the ending was done right their could have been a sequel or two. Barbra Mori is going to be type cast in the future aka Rubi. (what a francise this could have been),1133740800,,656,4.1328125
2269506,5,B00096S43K,"This is arguably one of the best telenovelas of 2004. The story follows Rubi, a poor, beautiful yet ambitious young woman who stops at nothing to get love and, most importantly, money. By schemes and lies, Rubi finally marries a wealthy man, Hector. Yet she cannot forget the one she truly loves, Alejandro. Rubi finally sees that material things are not as important as true love, goodness and kindness. Yet she denies her wrongdoing and, in the end, her evil ways drive her to disaster and misery.
 If you like telenovelas (Spanish soap operas) then you will love this one. The story line is refreshing and bittersweet.
EDIT: One important piece of information pertaining to this DVD. It does cut the story line considerably, since the makers TELEVISA do this to all their telenovelas on DVD. Yet the story is still coherent.",1127865600,12,827,4.823943661971831

It has all the qualities that make a telenovela great such as greed, passion, deceit, and romance to name a few. This is an awesome DVD to own. I highly recommend it to any Rubi fan. I would also recommend it to any fan of telenovelas. The DVD has English subtitles so you can still enjoy even if you don't speak fluent Spanish. There are a bunch of extras too! You definitely get your money's worth. There are certain parts that have been edited out, but they didn't take out any of the important parts.

2269513,5,B00096S43K,"A Rub&iacute; no la vi en formato de telenovela, sino en DVD, y la verdad es que me pareci&oacute; completa, bendita sea la persona a quien se le ocurri&oacute; comenzar a editar novelas en DVD, as&iacute; nos libramos de tantas subtramas que no le aportan nada a la historia original, &iquest;se imaginan lo que hubi&eacute;ramos podido pasar con las escenas de los personajes de la vecindad??? &iquest;Y qu&eacute; decir de la ambientaci&oacute;n? Me parece que despu&eacute;s de Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje y Amor Real, Rub&iacute; tiene los escenarios m&aacute;s hermosos que nunca se hayan visto, magn&iacute;fica fue la idea de grabar en Canc&uacute;n y otras locaciones que muestran la hermosura de M&eacute;xico. Por otra parte, el vestuario est&aacute; muy bien ajustado y creo que Rub&iacute; derroch&oacute; glamour en casi todos los cap&iacute;tulos de la novela, claro, Maribel, Helena, Sonia y otras tantas no se quedaron atr&aacute;s... Por cierto, Marlene Favela, quien anteriormente protagoniz&oacute; un bodr&iacute;o de lo m&aacute;s infame en Miami, ha mejorado mucho su actuaci&oacute;n en esta novela, mejor para ella. Y hablando de actuaci&oacute;n, todos los personajes est&aacute;n muy bien aunque a veces exageraban un poco, o les faltaba ese algo para convencer m&aacute;s al p&uacute;blico: Paty D&iacute;az, o sea Cristina, se mostr&oacute; muy melodram&aacute;tica en las escenas de llanto sobretodo en las que lloraba a su madre y le echaba la culpa a Rub&iacute;, no me gust&oacute; mucho, y qu&eacute; decir de los vecinos ya me parec&iacute;a estar viendo unos dibujos animados... A Jacqueline Bracamontes, Maribel, le falta todav&iacute;a madurar como actriz, no digo que sea mala, al contrario, pero tiene que perfeccionar a&uacute;n m&aacute;s sus dotes histri&oacute;nicos, creo que esta actriz dar&aacute; de que hablar... ah, y que arregle ese defecto en su boca, &iexcl;que no le sienta nada bien! Me quito el sombrero ante los dos galanes de Rub&iacute;, tanto Eduardo Santamarina como Sebasti&aacute;n Rulli nos han brindado unas actuaciones dignas de buena telenovela, sin exageraciones ni nada que pareciera artificial, ambos est&aacute;n muy bien como Alejandro y H&eacute;ctor respectivamente, hemos podido sentir lo que ellos sufr&iacute;an y disfrutaban a la vez, l&aacute;stima que H&eacute;ctor tuviera que morir pero as&iacute; es la historia y as&iacute; lo requiere el gu&iacute;on. Termino felicitando la elecci&oacute;n de B&aacute;rbara Mori, talento de TV Azteca, importada a Televisa, como la Descarada Rub&iacute;, y no creo que haya ni una artista en Televisa capaz de sacar adelante a ese personaje como lo hizo ella, bueno, s&iacute; hay una, pero que ya no puede presumir de tanta juventud como la Mori, y que lleva a&ntilde;os apartada del mundo art&iacute;stico y de los foros, &iquest;de qui&eacute;n estoy hablando? Pues de qui&eacute;n va a ser? De la que le hizo la vida de cuadritos a la pobre Edith Gonz&aacute;lez en Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje, la que casi mataba a su hermana gemela en Isabela... &iquest;Qui&eacute;n es ella? Es Ana Colchero, estupenda actriz mexicana quien por decisi&oacute;n propia se retir&oacute; porque, como ya lo vemos, las protagonistas femeninas siguen siendo las mismas, sumisas, tontas, lloronas... menos mal que nos sali&oacute; la Rub&iacute;, pero no se alegren tanto, no creo que otros productores se arriesguen como Jos&eacute; Alberto Castro, la hero&iacute;na dulce y tierna sigue la predilecta... Mi querida Ana, un consejo para ti, qu&eacute;date en tu casa, que nos dejaste novelas inolvidables como Coraz&oacute;n Salvaje, Alondra e Isabela, &iexcl;te felicito!

Termino diciendo que Rub&iacute; me dej&oacute; un muy buen sabor de boca aunque al final esperaba que la Descarada se redimiera y no terminara tan... tan... bueno, tan mal como termin&oacute;, y me gustar&iacute;a se&ntilde;alar que muy mala fue la idea de dejar pasar los a&ntilde;os y crecer a Fernanda, quien result&oacute; ser el vivo retrato de su t&iacute;a Rub&iacute;, para que vengara su suerte... La verdad es que no he podido contener la risa al ver a una Maribel madre de un muchacho de 18 a&ntilde;os, o a un Alejandro con bigotes, y la peluca rubia de Fernanda no le quedaba nada bien!! Es verdad que el tiempo pas&oacute;, &iexcl;pero para Rub&iacute; no! con sus cicatrices y pierna de menos, la Perversa sigui&oacute; manteniendo su juventud... La pregunta es: &iquest;qu&eacute; es lo que nos espera? En qu&eacute; estar&aacute; pensando el productor, acaso no ha aprendido que las secuelas siempre fracasan? Nada m&aacute;s ver las grandes producciones de Hollywood para darse cuenta de ello, mejor Rub&iacute; hubiera tenido un final digno, con la muerte de la Descarada que tanto da&ntilde;o ha causado, o bien hacer que se arrepintiera de todo y se dedicara a obras de caridad... no s&eacute;, cualquier cosa.",1121558400,2,4901,5.517287234042553

Rubi is exactly that, a tale of a young woman born into poverty but destines to live a life full of wealth and luxury and will go to any length to achieve her goal.

From the beginning I was hoping that someday Rubi would realize that having all the money in the world would not be the key to her happiness. But watching every single step of her immorality is what had me hooked.

Rubi was full of shocking and unthinkable moments. Abandoning her true love and stealing her best friend's fianc were two pivotal situations that had me on the edge of my seat.

At the end, once it was too late, Rubi realizes that wealth and luxury is not the key to happiness.

I found Rubi to be very rewarding because it depict the notion that good always prevails over evil.",1121040000,5,990,4.358695652173913

The series is a remake of an older Rubi. The plot is as unbelievable as you could want. The acting is fun, earnest, with lots of really bad stuff from Rubi--played by Barbara Mori who is obviously having a blast. Bracamontes is perfect as the good one.

 Rubi is a villain/protagonist which is unique and totally surprising style. You will love her at times and hate for most of it. She is ambitious, disloyal, traitress, false, barefaced and inconsequential. But also a dreamer, seductive, mysterious, intelligent, fun, conquering, charming and enchanting woman. The love triangle she gets into (Rubi-Alejandro-Hector) will make you have mixed feelings on which one she should end up with.
 I RECOMMEND IT, watch it and you won't regret! It is a remake from a 60s tv show and after this 2004 one, they also made Teresa (2010). But Rubi (2004) is THE BEST.",1457740800,,1343,6.254054054054054
