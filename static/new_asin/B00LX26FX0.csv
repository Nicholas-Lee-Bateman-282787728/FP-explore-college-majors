6509071,5,B00LX26FX0,Loved Season 1 & 2 and certainly hope there will be a Season 3.  All the main characters are realistically portrayed.  Didn't like the surprise ending and hoping Season 3 will clear it up.,1429228800,5,188,4.5
6509072,5,B00LX26FX0,"Loved this show, happy that Canadian TV continued with it and released the second series. Quick delivery",1426809600,,104,5.176470588235294
6509073,5,B00LX26FX0,The second season is fantastic.  It is really a shame that the brainless dweebs on American networks could not see the value of this show.  Looking forward to season 3.,1426204800,11,168,4.566666666666666

6509076,5,B00LX26FX0,Saving Hope is a really good television show. Unfortunately the only way to see Saving Hope in the United States is to buy the DVDs (if they are made available). I wish the producers of the show would allow all seasons of Saving Hope to be streamed on Amazon.com (Amazon Instant Video). This would allow the show to be viewed by people in the United States as well as Canada.,1424217600,13,375,4.371428571428571
6509077,5,B00LX26FX0,"My wife loved season one , but then it was taken off and only shown in Canada.  This was a chance for my wife to see the second season without buying it an episode at a time.  Season 3 has started in Canada and I'll buy it for her when it's available.  It's a nice show.",1423872000,14,270,3.7857142857142856

6509087,5,B00LX26FX0,"Love this show. Thought the lead looked familiar and then finally realized it is Daniel from Stargate SG-1. Wow. But if you have cable in the USA and get Ion syndicated channel, it is on  Tuesdays and Saturdays at the ridiculous time of 11:00PM and a second episode at midnight. Have never seen a whole episode so I have ordered the whole series, 1-4 and season 5 starts this Tuesday at midnight. Oh yes BTW I have all 11 seasons of SG-1, the 2 movies after and Atlantis. I guess I really like Michael Shanks.",1489190400,,509,4.3578947368421055

6509129,5,B00LX26FX0,"Love this series, but like many who are interested in it I can't stay up to watch it.  Glad to find it and have bought 2 copies of seasons 1 and 3.  One for me and one for  relative who lives in another state.  I hope season two becomes available soon as I want to buy two copies of it as well.  It's a great series, great acting and great story lines.  I like the shows that have ""spirit"" interaction.  It puts me in mind of Dead Zone with Anthony Michael Hall.  That was a favorite of mine too. Please get more soon.",1461024000,,518,3.9611650485436893

I have been trying to find out if there is a Season 3. I sure hope so. I have Season 1 on DVD and Season 2 on DVD is coming out later this year.",1454976000,,338,3.6301369863013697
6509132,5,B00LX26FX0,"Absolutely wonderful show, so glad it's on DVD to watch.  Missed it when it left the USA, glad it's back but on too late in my time zone.  Great cliff hanger at end.

6509133,5,B00LX26FX0,I found Season 1 is being broadcast on ION tv ! I think it's a cross between early  Grey's anatomy and Just like heaven the movie Reese Witherspoon did awhile back. Love it looks like a lot of twists and turns,1446422400,9,209,4.097560975609756
