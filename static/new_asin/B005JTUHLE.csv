You get the exercises with explanations. It really feels as if you were getting instruction from a teacher right in your home!!
The postures are very natural and relaxed so everyone can try them. Also, it goes into detailed instruction for those of us who want to understand how and what ChiKung works in our body.",1318982400,,477,4.975
8476031,5,B005JTUHLE,"This is one of the best DVD's you will find on the true knowledge and essence of Qigong. For beginners, it will give you the basis of breath and movement that will revitalize your body and keep you healthy. For advanced students, it will give you everything from the beginning but also the anatomy of Qigong and how each movement revitalizes each internal organ. You will learn things that you never knew before even if you have been doing Qi-Gong 20+ years. I still look at this and still learn something new! You won't lose with this DVD if you are serious about learning true authentic Qi-Gong!",1318464000,,597,4.588785046728972
