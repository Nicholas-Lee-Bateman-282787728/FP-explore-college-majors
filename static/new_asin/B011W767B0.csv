Although the theme is about a depressed mother not coping with caring for her five children, the siblings have a lovely and sometimes amusing connection which made the movie have a ""feel good"" vibe, bringing me to watch the movie several times.",1494028800,,264,4.760869565217392

Very well done. My heart went out 100% to the teen left in charge (abandoned by thier mother) ... period.  More than a stellar job caring for her siblings and home. As a single parent of four, (all but two grown now-3 still at home) I understand how tiring (demanding) it can be and wishing I had alone time, and/or help on occasion. Mind you, I would never leave my children alone to fend for themselves, ""I'm outta here! ... You fend for yourselves!"". Can't even imagine that scenario, so I found it extremely difficult feeling any sympathy for the parent ... no matter how overworked she believed she was. Unfortunately, for this teen it was routine ...so much so that roles are reversed.  It saddened me at the end-watching her patiently waiting for her mother, hoping for any communication/explanation yet nothing but a gallon of milk and keys haphazardly tossed onto the counter, and then much later a half hearted, ""I'm sorry"". I wanted to pull that young girl aside and simply...acknowledge her, thank her and love her. What this teen ended up doing left me speechless, upset and humbled...she gave unconditional comfort. I imagined other teens in similar situations.  How often have many parents simply ... quit and checked out-either physically present or not. How long could she (teenager) keep going like this without support?  Terrible situation ... especially considering, if she reports, the whole family could be torn apart ... unless other family is available ... maybe grandma.  These are the thoughts this movie evoked.

I was impressed by:  The actors, (all real life siblings from what I can gather). The relationship between them all was palpable.  The teen ... tender, soft tone of voice, attentive, responsible and certainly courageous ... normal wants and desires that all teens have, yet unable to act upon due to being the main caregiver.  The oldest boy- I am in no way surprised he behaved the way he did-bless his heart.  The second oldest boy ... precious, helpful and caring heart-doing his best to hold his own. The third oldest boy ... ever playful, so innocent, (all of them are) unaware, just another day.  The youngest ... same.  Considering they were left to their own devices,  (thankfully no one was hurt or lost) they all got along for the most part..pretty remarkable.  In regards to the movie's settings/props (there were many, including 2 dogs and toys, the rooms, bathroom etc).  I will mention one. I was struck by the many photos around the house ... which spoke of better times perhaps. The photos, the way they played, made beds and brushed their teeth together and more) left me wondering what happened to cause this mother to check out. She obviously did something good and right based on how her children behaved.

Again, very well done. If you are looking for a fancy film, this is not it. This is raw.
