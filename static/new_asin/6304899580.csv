7879027,4,6304899580,"This was the first White Wolf movie I watched and it got me into the series.  This was not a bad film, but at times I wished Pamela would stop her annoying whining.  It shows how two different characters have to work together, trust each other and the white wolf to lead them to safety.  Not a bad film.",1228348800,3,303,4.101694915254237
