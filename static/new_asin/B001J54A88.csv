8311891,1,B001J54A88,"Bought this to watch for a class. Given that my studies focus on underrepresented groups, I was expecting to at least appreciate this as an effort. However, this ""documentary"" not only didn't teach anything but it was just BORING to watch. Further more, many aspects of the filming brought out further stereotypes that, someone else, may interpret as confirmation about negative perceptions about gay women they already had-the opposite of what they filmmakers claim to be trying to do.
There are many other sources of information on subcultures, gender, and people.",1410480000,,566,5.230769230769231
8311892,5,B001J54A88,"This ""rockumentary"" as it's dubbed is quite illuminating.  The perspectives of a diverse group of women [both 'gay' and 'straight'] lends greatness to this film and makes it a Classic.  There is no other like it out there at the moment, and thankfully, it stands upright on its own and is a worthy beacon of light.

I learned a lot and felt more.

It is one for the Library, my personal library.  It merits viewing by anyone and everyone who wants to come home to themselves: be they gay, straight or whatever distinction. This film, while definitely about women of color that identify varying ways as lesbians, is quite universal in its affect of touching the soul and living life on your own terms, courageously and joyfully.  Everyone wants that.

This film will move you and getting unstuck is essential.

Enjoy!

8311894,4,B001J54A88,"Not only did this video feature a very talented group of female artists ""doing their thang"", it also provided a glimspe into a little known piece of black women's history. Good work!",1256256000,,182,4.71875
8311895,5,B001J54A88,"the documentary is a breath of fresh air. an original but i wish there were more out there just like it. intelligent woman, re-humanizing a very human experience. it makes you think, it makes you laugh, it made me happy. there were so many different perspectives on the subject of homosexuality, coming from women of many different backgrounds. the film is quite diverse and i would recommend it to anyone. great conversation starter for the topic of homosexuality from the perspectives of homosexual women. and the music video ""make a move"" by musical artist/director (of the film) hanifah walidah, is a wonderful bonus at the end!

(if there are more documentaries out there like this they need to be given more attention so that one doesn't have to dig and search for them becuase this film is a true treasure.)

check out iloveupeople.com or suckaforlife.com to learn more about the film, and more about the directors and filmmakers, hanifah walidah and olive demetrius. of them (and there websites)... i am a huge fan!
