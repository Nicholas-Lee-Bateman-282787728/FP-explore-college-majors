8232796,5,B000YHMTIA,I do believe season 8 is the Columbo mystey movie collection. I could be wrong but check the show titles on the mystery movies and see.,1325894400,5,135,4.230769230769231
8232797,5,B000YHMTIA,Yes I believe theres a copywrite problem here in the US . Thats why they stopped at season 7 .Season 8 is actually from ABC where as the earlier seasons were NBC. As for the amount of seasons there would appear to be 12 all told. This is what the pal 2 versions carry and they are laid out the same as the the US versions up to season 7 . This should get resolved . Its unacceptable .,1310688000,11,384,3.8734177215189876

8232799,5,B000YHMTIA,"Can someone please tell me if the two Columbo murder mystery DVDs (1989, 1990,) are the same episodes in the regular seasons. If they are then no sense in buying them, however if they are not from the regular season then I will buy both of them...Thank you to who ever is able to answer my question.",1285459200,4,299,4.2631578947368425
