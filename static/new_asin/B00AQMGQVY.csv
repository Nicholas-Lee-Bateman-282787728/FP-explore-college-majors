5471324,4,B00AQMGQVY,"I'm a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan so I really had to get these movies to complete my collection. The movies are great and must haves for a collection, so they speak for themselves. HOWEVER not at any price. The picture quality is of DVD quality and I don't notice much, if any, difference from past transfers so if you already owned them on DVD, don't bother. I got this for $24, so I feel that is a fair price for this.

Now for the most disappointing part, no extras with the exception of some audio commentaries. The thing I really loved about buying Hitchcock movies are the interesting documentaries that come with them. It's always wonderful to hear behind the scene stories and interviews with the cast, collaborators, and of course, Hitchcock's daughter.

5471349,5,B00AQMGQVY,"SPELLBOUND was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and produced by David O. Selznick in 1945. As the story unravels it is essentially a murder plot interwoven around psychiatrists and psychoanalysis. It is actually Alfred Hitchcock's approach to the story and his collaborations with composer Miklos Rozsa and surrealist artist Salvador Dali that highlights this film. Gregory Peck plays John ""J.B."" Ballantine who poses as a psychiatrist while in a state of amnesia. Uncovered by Dr. Constance Peterson played by Ingrid Bergman, Ballantine must find out if he is responsible for the death of the missing psychiatrist that he posed as and simultaneously discover his own identity. Miklos Rozsa's score is both romantic yet eerie as Ballantine tries to remember what happened through analysis of his dreams. Alfred Hitchcock hired Salvador Dali to design illustrations and paintings in order to construct a crisp and vivid rendering of these dreams. Hitchcock did not want to use conventional techniques such as blurred camera shots to recreate the dreams. He wanted them to be as clear and even sharper than the rest of the film. He wanted Dali's style of using shadows, lines of convergence and the idea of infinite distance incorporated into the dream sequences. In the dream sequence we see a black stage highlighted with people at gambling tables with huge mysterious looking eyes peering over them. A man cuts away at the fabric of one eye with a giant scissors revealing another eye. In another part of the dream we see a man standing on a roof behind a chimney that has sprouted roots. The hooded man holds what looks like a deformed or eccentric wagon wheel in his hand. In the distance there is a formation of rocks and boulders, which look like they are sprouting into the shape of a man's head. Another part of the dream shows a man running down a pitched geometric plane as the shadow of a bird follows him. In the background there are geometric shapes and lines that go off into infinity. All these images must be interpreted into experiences from reality. Dali's images are unsettling and thought provoking. Eventually, the eccentric wagon wheel turns out to represent the chambers of a revolver pistol and reveals the true identity of the murderer. A surrealistic painting brings to the canvas an image from reality but puts it into a context of the unreal. I think Dali was successful in translating the realistic elements from the plot into a vision of incomprehensibility of the conscious human mind. Hitchcock and the scriptwriter Ben Hecht then had their characters translate Dali's images back into plausible reality. This is brilliant filmmaking years ahead of its time.

NOTORIOUS is Alfred Hitchcock's wartime romantic thriller. Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi spy living in the United States. Her father has been convicted of treason as we see from open doors outside the courtroom. Bergman an amorous and promiscuous playgirl who is reluctantly conscripted by an enigmatic American espionage agent Cary Grant, finds herself in more peril than she bargained for on her assignment in Brazil. This has always been considered one of Hitchcock's better thrillers. NOTORIOUS is absolutely intriguing and deliberately paced. As an Alfred Hitchcock enthusiast it took me some time to realize the power of this film. I even watched this film again before I wrote this review. For me it no longer seems out of step from his other films. In a strange way it jumps ahead to a style Hitchcock employed in 1969's ""TOPAZ."" For me the romanticism combined with Cary Grant introspective performance rank this among Hitchcock's best. There are love scenes just as there are in ""TOPAZ."" Equally as in ""TOPAZ"" the actors just seem to be going through the motions in these passionate scenes. However, there is no lack of acting talent in either film. Hitchcock's intent of the histrionics is for his actors to give as realistic performances as possible and downplay the dramatics. The characters in both films are spies and live their lives from day to day never knowing if this one will be their last. People leading such lives must learn to go on with detached indifference and suppress any feelings of emotion and love. Both Bergman and Grant turn in excellent performances. This is not the same Cary Grant audiences were used to seeing. He let none of his own personality surface and just played the character as written. He remains always distant and aloof in his scenes with Bergman. We can only read the disgust on his face when Bergman is off camera of his true feelings for her. Bergman playing off his aloofness also suppresses her love for him when both are on camera together. So there is a romantic theme in the film but it is not visually provocative as in other Hitchcock films because of the constraints of the film's plot. That is what makes it look so different from his other films. We also see shades of ""PSYCHO"" present in this film. Claude Rains as the aristocratic Nazi Alexander Sebastian has a similar quixotic relationship with his mother as Norman Bates has or had with his. One highlight of the film is underrated composer Roy Webb's beautifully written theme. From a technical standpoint Hitchcock once again pulls off an impressive and notable camera shot, somewhat similar to a shot he later used in ""Marnie."" Hitchcock brings the camera from the top of a stairway overlooking a huge cocktail party in Claude Rains' sprawling mansion and slowly moves through the guests right up to the ""key"" that is in Bergman 's hand. The close up of the ""key"" is a crucial one for that ""key"" physically and symbolically unlocks the secret disguised in Claude Rains' mysterious wine cellar. This film is Hitchcock's most underplayed and seductively sensuous. It is never overtly romantic yet remains absorbing and suspenseful. However I still do not think it looks like your typical Alfred Hitchcock film.

Despite much talk and disagreement as to who contributed what to it, REBECCA is definitely an Alfred Hitchcock film. Producer David O. Selznick hands-on approach to producing definitely is evident, yet the film does not look entirely like your typical Selznick movie for that period. I would think this is director Alfred Hitchcock's doing. Yet again, it does not resemble the style that Hitchcock employed in his first American film, FOREIGN CORESPONDENT.",1398297600,,6386,4.9672897196261685
5471350,5,B00AQMGQVY,"I think Rebecca is one of the best films ever made and was delighted to find it in this reasonably priced package. Every title looks terrific.

5471351,5,B00AQMGQVY,"Alfred Hitchcock considered these movies among the best he did. Actually, the way he planned to film these movies would have made them really great - the Studio and the rating agency forced him to change the endings, even though they were in the books that he used to create the scripts.

5471355,5,B00AQMGQVY,"I won't pontificate on these wonderful Hitchcock films but I do want to comment on the quality of the transfers to Blu-ray.  In a word, great.  The clarity, subtleness of tones and tonal range are all there.  Grain is at an acceptable minimum.  Audio is good.  All the disks have extras including a ""Making of"" documentary.  It's a great collection at a very good price.",1391644800,9,370,4.615384615384615
5471356,5,B00AQMGQVY,"This is a great addition to my 'Masterpiece collection'.  I enjoyed each of the films.  Though I am not able to comment on all the technical aspects of these Blu-Rays, I can say that they looked very good to me as well as better than the DVD format which I also have.  They do have grain but I believe that that is only natural because of the age of the films and did nothing to detract from my enjoyment of the films but, rather, enhanced my enjoyment of these films which is the way I remember enjoying them so long ago in my youth.

I will say that 'Notorious' is an interesting B&W film for much of its film screens that were used as background in place of a lot of scenes.  It seems easier to see this on the BluRay of my 65"" screen.  'Rebecca' looked really good to me.  Blacks were black and whites were white.  Everything looked very sharp.  As for 'Spellbound' though not as sharp as the other two, it still looks way better than my DVD copy.  And, of course, you've got the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to make the film easier on the eyes.  In any case, I think the film 'Rebecca' makes this 3-movie set all worth it.  And many believe that 'Rebecca' is Hitchcock's finest film ever.

Hitchcock was a master of his craft and I can and will enjoy watching these films more than once over the coming years.  They come on 3 Blu-Ray discs in a sturdy case, rather than one of those flimsy cases where the plastics are actually cut out on the front and back, which I don't like and tend to replace with better cases also bought here on Amazon.",1390780800,3,1544,4.243150684931507

Definitely recommend this Hitchcock collection, without hesitation.",1387584000,,379,5.19672131147541
5471360,5,B00AQMGQVY,"I'm pretty shocked by the negative reviews of this set. Let's dispel some of the ranker untruths among them.

1. These are not 480p ""DVD scans."" These are 1080p scans of original film elements. These transfers look like film on your HD television. Each movie shows detail that a DVD simply could not. They have their problems, yes, but these are problems like print damage, contrast pulsing, or dated wipes and dissolves that degrade detail - problems that dog a lot of movies of this vintage. None of the problems are related to these transfers not being high definition.

2. These movies were shot in the 1.37:1 ""Academy Ratio."" It is simply not a valid criticism to complain that they are not widescreen. There is nothing to show on the sides of the frame. Would you prefer that the top and bottom of the frame be cut off so you can have a ""zoomed"" image on your television? I wouldn't.

3. Grain is a good thing. Grain is detail. Grain is what the emulsion layer of film stock creates when it is exposed. For a high definition scan of a piece of film to show the grain structure of said film is a mark of excellence and nothing else. If you want to watch movies that have been scrubbed free of natural film grain, pick up ""The Truman Show"" or ""Dark City."" Watch them real closely, then come back here to discuss whether grain is something to be complained about when you witness the waxy faces and lack of fine detail that artificial grain reduction creates.

4. Each of these discs contains several extras. I don't know where the claim they don't comes from. Maybe someone doesn't know how to use the ""Pop Up Menu"" button on their remote? Each film contains at least one commentary, as well as an hour-plus of documentary material per disc. Several include screen tests and interviews with Hitchcock himself. One even includes a radio adaptation of the movie.

OK. All that said, you are getting 3 Hitchcock classics for a low price. These movies represent (but by no means exhaust) Hitchcock's early Hollywood efforts, in collaboration with producer David O. Selznick. They don't generally show the technique of Hitchcock's ""masterpiece"" period in the 50s and early 60s, but they are all excellent movies  (Rebecca won best picture in 1940) with strong stories and interesting psychological elements. They feature some big stars of Hollywood's ""golden age,"" including Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Laurence Olivier, Ingrid Bergman, and Joan Fontaine.

For this price, they are an easy recommendation for fans of Hitchcock or of classic films. They represent a solid upgrade over DVD editions of the same films.

UPDATE: The current list price is way more than what I paid when I wrote this review. I can't really recommend it at this price. I advise waiting until it is re-issued or goes back under forty dollars.",1387411200,238,2815,4.742331288343558

8556464,2,B00AQMGQVY,"I bought this 3-film set for $10 on Amazon. If you haven't already got them it's a great bargain (which is why I gave it any stars at all). Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director and has many great films worth owning and viewing repeatedly over time. There are several collections of his works but not all in one.

This Classic Blu-ray Collection was previously released on DVD in 2008 as the Premiere Collection. IMO, Rebecca is the best film here (it won the Best Picture Academy Award in 1940), then Notorious, and Spellbound lags behind the others - it's a neat concept for a film but the film itself is rather boring and only continues to be famous because of the Salvadore Dali designed sequences.

My complaint (and the reason for deducting stars) is that it appears that no further remastering of the films has been done, and that the DVD masters were simply put to Blu-ray. It was a useless purchase for me, since I already owned the DVD's, which allowed me to do a comparison. All 3 films still look rather grainy and washed out. Were the original reels not available? Other classic films from the same era have been beautifully remastered.

The same special features from the DVD's are also present here, minus the Stills Galleries. Since Blu-ray can hold much more information than DVD, there's no real reason to have omitted a bonus feature and not included more. The Spellbound DVD had a play option not found on the Blu-ray, namely to play with or without the overture and exit music; the BluRay automatically does this.

While the DVD's were released in separate cases, each with a full sized folding insert with film information and track names, the Blu-ray case houses the 3 discs together neatly but without any insert or information. The ""Interview With Hitchcock"" bonus on each film is audio only; it's correctly labelled that way on the other 2 films, but not on Spellbound - it wasn't correctly labelled on the DVD either, which again makes it appear that no further remastering has been done since 2008.

Notorious has a special feature called ""Restoration Comparison"", same as the DVD, which is supposed to show the improvement from the original source to the current version: 1) it's the exact same as the DVD, which proves the Blu-ray is not better; 2) plus/worse, there's little (if any) noticeable difference at all between the original source and the ""Restored"" images.

All 3 Blu-rays have the same menu setup. When you insert the disc, the film will begin playing, so you have to use your remote to get to the menu screen. If you choose Scene Selection and choose a scene, it takes a good minute for the menu to disappear from the screen, which is annoying.

Again, it's only a worthwhile buy if you don't already own these films, otherwise keep your DVD's and wait for a proper remastering to be done.",1453593600,5,2837,4.696177062374246
