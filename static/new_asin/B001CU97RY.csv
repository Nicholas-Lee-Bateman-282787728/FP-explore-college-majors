8289884,5,B001CU97RY,If you're not familiar with the cultural crossroads that lead to this hugely important work of fiction - you have quite a treat in store for you in watching this DVD.  I've watched in a few times over the years - and have given it as gifts (to scientist friends and writers who enjoy the confluence of scientific/medical/cultural/psychological history that led to this book) where it was very well-received.  I can't recommend this higher.  The other review?  Dry?  Just deal-dull wrong.,1509753600,,487,4.962962962962963
