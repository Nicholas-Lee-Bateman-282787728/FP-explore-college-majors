I COULD,'T EVEN GET THRU THE WHOLE THING.. I WOUND UP GIVING IT AWAY. BUT NONE OF THIS WAS THE FAULT OF THE SUPPLIER. THE TAPE WAS RECEIVED WITH NO PROBLEMS.",1353974400,,317,4.0476190476190474
7876737,5,6304628870,"The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television!

""Borderland"" (1937) (82 mins/B&W), this time Cassidy goes undercover to catch a bandit known as ""The Fox"", plenty of action and hard-riding ahead for Hoppy and his faithful steed Topper!

Outstanding direction by Nate Watt...and as always George ""Gabby"" Hayes (Windy Halliday), backing Hoppy's play whenever trouble enters the picture...it's plain to see...Hoppy Is Here To Stay!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy. The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ~ William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment...Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of five films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys...just the way we like 'em.",1162166400,,4136,5.409937888198757
