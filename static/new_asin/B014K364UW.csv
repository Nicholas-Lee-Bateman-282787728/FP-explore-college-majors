8731045,5,B014K364UW,"A Hard Day is extremely entertaining as it starts out darkly humorous then becomes a suspenseful, unpredictable mystery. A slightly corrupt cop who has the absolute worst day in his life tries to cover an accident using bad judgment which forces him deep into a criminal world he never intended on entering. A well acted, tightly written script with believable characters mixed with unpredictable bursts of action make this Korean film highly enjoyable.",1454198400,,453,5.219178082191781
