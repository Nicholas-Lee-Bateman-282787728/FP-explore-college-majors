Very inspirational, he is a great teacher. I also enjoyed segments on how he gets to know the model and how he tries to show her personality in the work. Expensive but well worth it. After seeing this, I want to get his DVD on charcoal drawing.",1529798400,,381,4.536231884057971
8631238,5,B00H9KZAHC,"This is by far the best educational DVD the money can buy! It is not only packed with information and useful insight into Davids technique; but it is also beautifully produced. It is carefully filmed from the artists point of view  you see things as you would when you actually paint yourself: model/painting, then painting/palette  so camera moves and holds focus just as your eyes would do. David explains and demonstrates his method with simplicity and understanding for what the artist(viewer) is most likely eager to know. Highly inspirational and useful  higly recommended!",1407196800,3,579,5.204301075268817
8631239,5,B00H9KZAHC,"From the very beginning of watching this DVD, I was immediately drawn into the process of how the artist creates a painting.  David Jon Kassan not only shows us his incredible skills as a technical painter, but he also shows us how he connects with the subjects he paints and allows us to get to know Jaece Lutrec and hear her incredible story.  Being able to paint is one thing, but the way David shows us how he captures WHO Jaece is could not have been better expressed than in this fantastic video. It is mesmerizing to watch the detailed brushstrokes he uses in his process keeping me entranced into how well skilled he is.  The production and filming process also brings us into who Jaece is as well as who David is, all while showing us how he approaches a painting which is an invaluable lesson.  Artist or not, this is a great DVD showing how David Jon Kassan passionately creates a painting from start to finish.  I highly recommend adding this to anyone's collection.  Watching this DVD really brought inspiration to me and has shown me new techniques to bring to my own work.",1400803200,2,1087,4.520408163265306

Mr. Kassan is not only an amazing artist, He is a great teacher who is inspiring and so willing to share his knowledge and approach with others.
I was a big fan of his work ,yet was a little hesitant to purchase his first drawing video due to the price. After watching his drawing video, I literally rushed to the computer to order his new painting video when it went on sale.  Comparing the price to the cost of a workshop, or art class, the price is very reasonable.  I have been painting for over 30 years and have  been dealing with issues related to  broken color, spatial relationships and using color and edge control  to turn form. Truthfully, it has been a struggle. After watching David's DVD, I actually ""see"" differently. His working method allows one to be more sensitive to color changes, form relationships and edge quality.  Years ago when attending art school, I would be a little frustrated when college professors would do a quick demo of a block -in, yet never show how to further develop the painting. This video shows the COMPLETE process from start to finish. It is a great gift to be able to witness how he progresses from a fluid expressive block-in of massed shapes and develops the image into a  highly detailed, yet richly rendered image.  It is like standing over his shoulder and watch him not only paint the image, but understand his thought process and philosophy about painting.  I always wished that I could go back in time and watch Rembrandt or Sargent paint.............with today's technology, we have the opportunity to see a modern master at work. I believe that artists at all levels will get much from this video. I have suggested that my students purchase a copy and spend time watching it.  It also amazes me that David's approach is so low key and humble, yet gets down to the core of what is really important in painting and expressing oneself through interpreting a subject through one's personal lens. His comments about art , observation and creativity is eye opening  (literally!).
 This video will be something that will speak to you in different ways as you develop as an artist. I'm sure I will still be watching this video in years to come. There will be things that he says that will resonate with me and continue to help me grow.

  I hope that David Kassan creates a follow up video in the future that focuses of feet and hands!  ( I would not hesitate to run to the computer and order it!). I hope to one day take a workshop with David. This is the next best thing. If you purchase this video, you will not be disappointed.",1390262400,18,2752,4.551724137931035
