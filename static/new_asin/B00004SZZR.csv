7922185,4,B00004SZZR,"This is one of a number produces by the same company showing the ""heavies""
in history as human beings with people whom they are mentoring.  I have a
number of them and recommend them especially to teachers who want to show
the ""great masters"" as real living humans. The actors chosen are superb.
The adults caught up in their work, paying little attention to the youth, who
in their turn are inspired by the adult and keep 'picking' at them until
the ""master"" begins to see the talent and value in the young person.
To say that the master sees this as part of his legacy becomes obvious as
the film progresses.  In each of these films the acting is very well
directed by the production staff. I highly recommend them, and learned
a few things myself in watching them. I am impressed and wish the production
company would take it upon itself to produce more in this vein.",1358899200,3,870,4.465408805031447
7922186,5,B00004SZZR,"This is a highly emotional and poignant production by the delightful Canadian film company, Devine Entertainment. A rich tapestry of art, history and human nature is woven together with forgiveness, responsibility and commitment. It provides children with a window into the world of the past and presents Jewish traditions in a positive way. It gives insite into the life of an artis with an appealing and sad story. Our kids commented: ""The people were the story. It showed the Jews relating to Christians very well."" ""I liked Rembrandt. I liked it when he made faces."" ""I want to learn more about art."" It's most suitable for 8 to 14-year-olds.",1000252800,5,646,4.935779816513762
