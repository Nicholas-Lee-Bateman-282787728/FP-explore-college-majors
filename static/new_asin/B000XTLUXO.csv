8229714,1,B000XTLUXO,"The DVD would not play on my Sony player because of ""area limitations"".  This is the first time I have experienced this on my Sony machine.  There was no warning on the disc or the product ad stating that the DVD may not play on some machines.

I returned the DVD and received a refund.",1267056000,,286,4.163636363636364
8229715,1,B000XTLUXO,"The music is great, the performance is great, and the audio is great. BUT one buys a VIDEO recording of an orchestra performing in order to SEE the orchestra performing. Yes, its great to see Karajan's conducting, BUT I don't need to just see him ONLY for the duration of the entire recording. Nor am I satisfied merely to be given glimpses of the various sections of the orchestra playing. Certainly not when the entire orchestra is playing! Wonder whose idiotic idea is this to allow us merely peeks here and there as if through the keyhole? Ought to be SHOT! One star, because I didn't get a video recording - its only as good as an audio one..... Fume!!!!",1261958400,,659,4.5
