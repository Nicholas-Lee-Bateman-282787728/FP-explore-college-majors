1885924,5,B00009NH8I,This may not be what people of today call a great movie but I love it. Though it may be simple and its fun to watch throughout the entire time. Have you ever had a movie that you just never get tired of? This is one of those movies to me.,1401408000,2,238,3.6862745098039214
1885925,3,B00009NH8I,This movie is funny and that is good because there is not much else you can say about the picture other than most every thing takes place in the dark.,1368403200,,150,4.033333333333333
1885926,2,B00009NH8I,"This Alpha Video presentation is almost up to their standards.

Webster and Jackie Fry (James Dunn and Florence Rice) are just married; we have no idea why. They are given a farm and inherit a body. The standard body disappears and the house seems haunted. We see ridiculously dumb police, wise cracking newlyweds, a hangman with more Morey Amsterdam one-liners. For some reason there is a comic relief chauffer. And a peeping Tom. The film goes from bad to worse.

A lots of dummies can walk. and Ive got brains I never even used yet. Mabel Todd as the ditzy Little Sister Mabel",1342828800,,579,4.611650485436893
1885927,3,B00009NH8I,The Ghost and the Guest is one of P.R.C.'s better productions.  It deserves better treatment than an Alpha release.  The dark scenes are hard to see and there is some footage missing.,1242777600,3,183,4.6875
1885928,1,B00009NH8I,"Ghost and the Guest is a clever ""B"" comedy, unfortunately the quality is so awful the DVD is not worth the excruciating 56 minutes it takes to watch it. It's a bit like staring through gauze.

Pass this one by.",1189641600,13,210,4.25
1885929,3,B00009NH8I,"This is one of those escapasim type movies from the forties. During the war years, people were looking for light hearted fun, snappy dialog and visual humor. This movie provides all three. It's not a high budget film so don't try to compare it with Mad, Mad, Mad World, or other comedys of that ilk. Good halloween fare for the entire family. If you want a evening of ""what they were watching back then"" you'll enjoy The Ghost and the Guest, I sure did. Sam Walk",1188432000,2,462,4.383720930232558
1885930,1,B00009NH8I,It was hard to view because it was such poor quality.  I couldn't see most scenes that were filmed as night time.  It was very old and very difficult to watch.  I really had to make myself 'hang in there' to finish watching.  It's a donate to the library DVD now.  Not worth watching and certainly not worth buying.,1144195200,14,315,4.271186440677966
1885931,3,B00009NH8I,"I love old black and white movies and find most pretty enjoyable, but this one just wasn't up to pare.",1127865600,2,102,4.15

7992044,4,B00009NH8I,"This is a cute whodunit from old time Hollywood and the ""B"" movie era.  James Dunn who actually won an Oscar for ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" stars in this light comedy/mystery and is ably supported by the very funny Mantan Moreland.  This isn't ""Gone With the Wind"", but it's clean cut family fare the whole family and sit down and enjoy. Make the buttered popcorn, gather the kids and enjoy!",1473552000,,391,4.492957746478873

7992048,4,B00009NH8I,"First, the house in question was not haunted.  Second, it belonged to someone else but a new bride (Florence Rice as Jackie Frye) kept insisting it was a present from her father, much to the surprise of the man who owned it (Robert Dudley as retired executioner Ben Bowron).  Until things could be straightened out, they decide to stay the night.  Whereupon a coffin shows up carrying a live ""body.""  Naturally, this being an old house, there are secret passages, secret rooms, secret stairs.  The police show up when the ""body"" disappears.  The ""body's"" relatives soon show up so everyone is confined on the premises until they can figure out what's going on.  A large quantity of diamonds is involved.

James Dunn, as Webster Frye, tries too hard to keep things lively and fun.  As mentioned, a long extended sequence while searching a secret passage is entirely too dark.  It's an old film so the quality of the transfer is questionable.  But it's a cute movie, written by comedian Morey Amsterdam.  My favorite character was the poor disgruntled executioner forced to retire because ""they said hangings are old fashioned.""  ""They switched to gas.""

Pleasant but unexceptional.",1444521600,,1180,4.954081632653061
7992049,2,B00009NH8I,"This is NOT anywhere near what I had HOPED to expect from a 30's mystery thriller. I am a fan of Hollywoods ""golden age"" but I should have known better. No more low priced films from American Film Classics.",1432944000,3,206,4.3076923076923075
