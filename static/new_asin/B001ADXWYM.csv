3447481,5,B001ADXWYM,"My husband and I are huge Pratchett fans.  We had Wyrd Sisters on video tape before we learned that it was out on DVD.  Soul Music just seemed icing on the cake, especially since our toddler loves it.  She loves music and just fell in love with the guitar on the show :D.

We can't wait to see if the BBC releases more of the books as cartoons or live action.",1222992000,9,359,4.014084507042254
3447482,4,B001ADXWYM,"I watched Terry Pratchett's ""Hogfather"" and enjoyed it very much.  When I went on Amazom.com to order a copy, I found that Terry had other movies.  I ordered ""Wyrd Sisters"" and ""Soul Music"".  Hogfather contained real actors.  Unfortunately when I started to watch the first of the other videos, I discovered they were in cartoon form (but not for young children).  I was somewhat disappointed, but still liked the videos.  I was spoiled by ""Hogfather"".
All three movies are very similar.  I love British humor and they certainly fit the bill.  In ""Hogfather"" there was so much going on that I had to watch it more than once.
In summary, I liked the movies very much.  If you do not appreciate the dryness of British Humor these movies are probably not for you",1222732800,26,759,4.646616541353383
3447483,5,B001ADXWYM,"Terry Pratchett's 2 books - Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music are well worth watching. If you are a lover of fantasy fiction then you'll love these. Terry's forte is writing fairy stories for grown-ups! His imagination is vast and his characters are hilarious. Thoroughly enjoyable and full of witty humour this dvd is the ideal introduction to his genre of thinking. If you have never picked up a Pratchett book, these movies will send you straight to your local bookshop looking for more!",1222560000,3,484,4.843373493975903
3447484,4,B001ADXWYM,"Imagine a world that is completely flat, atop four elephants that are standing on the shell of a giant space-traveling turtle.

Now, if you can deal with that, then ""Terry Pratchett's Discworld Collection"" is the next logical step. It brings together two cartoon adaptations of Pratchett's deliciously offbeat fantasy world -- witches, Death, evil kings, talking kingdoms, and music with rocks in. The animation is a bit rough, but the quirky characters and intricate fantasy plots make it all worthwhile.

""Wyrd Sisters"" starts on a stormy night. And three witches are abroad -- upright Granny Weatherwax, tipsy Nanny Ogg and new-agey romantic Magrat. Elsewhere, the king is murdered by his scheming cousin Felmet, and remains a ghost haunting the castle of Lancre, and his baby son ends up in the hands of the witches. The witches immediately foist the baby off on a traveling band of actors (""He killed him! And right up in front of everyone!""), and keep an eye on the new royals, the mentally unstable Duke Felmet and his nasty, schemey wife.

Unfortunately, they also hate witches. As taxes rise and the witches are persecuted and blamed for everything that goes wrong, Granny starts hearing strange cries out in the night -- the land itself is unhappy with Felmet's reign. And to deal with this nutty usurper (""Is this a dagger I see before me?"" ""No milord, it's just me handkerchief""), it will take the most magic the Wyrd Sisters can summon up -- not to mention a ghost, Death, and a long-lost prince...

""Soul Music"" also opens on a stormy night, when Death's daughter and her husband die in a fiery carriage crash. Her death nags at Death, leaving him wondering what the meaning of life is. And when Death vanishes, his young granddaughter Susan is summoned by the Death of Rats and a talking raven -- turns out she has the power to do Death's job. Meanwhile, a young aspiring bard, who renames himself Bud Y Celyn, leaves home for Ankh-Morpork, befriends a couple of other aspiring musicians, and ends up forming a rock band -- with a strange magical guitar that instantly turns him into a ""music with rocks in"" star.

But that powerful guitar is also messing up the normal death cycle, and is exerting a strange power over the people who hear it -- even the wizards of Unseen Academy are affected. And as Susan finds herself increasingly drawn to this tormented young musician, she finds that she may not be able to deal with the power of his guitar. But can Death himself do the job?

You can probably depend on anything written by or based on something by Terry Pratchett to be hilarious, well-written and deliciously unpredictable. ""Wyrd Sisters"" and ""Soul Music"" are no exception -- both are quite faithful to the original novels by Pratchett, and are crammed with tiny homages and well-loved characters, such as Nobby Nobbs, Ridcully, the Death of Rats, the Librarian, and many others.

And both stories take awhile to unfold, letting events gradually build up to a stunning climax, and weaving intricate storylines with lots and lots of supporting characters. At the same time, he interweaves a lot of deeper questions into his storylines about love, death and minding your own business. And Pratchett doesn't skimp on dramatic, intense scenes, such as Susan seeing what happened between her parents and her grandfather long ago, and the tragic results.

All this, and we get to see Nanny Ogg sing the song about how the hedgehog can never be ""whassnamed"" at all. Yeah, there's a lot of deliciously warped humor -- a ghost misplacing his head, Granny's undignified flight around the kingdom, the witches summoning a demon, Death's searches for meaning (""I've seen the infinite... it's nothing special""), and Granny's inability to grasp that the theatre is all pretend (""It's been a long time since I've seen a theatre played properly!"").

Here's a warning -- the animation is quite rough and lacking in dimension. Some of the characters are kind of goofy-looking, particularly the wizards, but it's not the worst I've seen.

In fact, you don't notice the animation so much when you notice the brilliant characters. The witches are fun counterpoints to one another, and they have a castleful of deranged tyrants, weary Fools, whiny demons and one very bored royal poltergeist. And Susan comes across as a sort of younger Granny, while Buddy's bandmates provide a sort of ""real-person"" presence. And the wizards are just all crazy.

And Christopher Lee is simply perfect as Death, Discworld's endearing incarnation of expiration. He gets all the great lines too (""Oh BUGGER!"" he exclaims as he drives off a cliff), and even a scene where he suffers from stage fright.

""Terry Pratchett's Discworld Collection"" suffers from some rough animation, but it has vast casts of likable weirdos and strange magics. Definitely worth checking out.",1213142400,53,4852,4.925336597307221

Both Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music are animated films which were made in England. Of the two, Wyrd Sisters is by far the best and rates 5 stars on it's own. Soul Music isn't as good and I would only give it 3 stars by itself but was still worth viewing. Wyrd Sisters is inspired by Shakespeare's play Macbeth, with Pratchett poking fun at the Bard unmercifully. But it's all in good fun and Pratchett as usual spins wildly out of control.

3447501,3,B001ADXWYM,"I was astonished when I first discovered that some of Terry Pratchet's Discworld books had been adapted into movies, and I quickly set about collecting them as soon as I did.  These were the last ones I got, in part because I thought it was odd that there were TWO movies here.  That didn't quite make sense to me.

Once I got them of course it became clear.  These appear to be earlier adaptations, made before the movies, when they had decided to do them in animated form.  They appear to have been specials run on British TV.

As the description notes there are two books adapted here, Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music.  Overall they are competently done, though I much preferred Soul Music to Wyrd Sisters--I felt the same way about the books so perhaps it's tied to that.  Wyrd Sisters seems a little long while Soul Music seemed very quick; format wise Wyrd Sisters is one big long movie whereas Soul Music is presented in seven episodes.

The animation style, for me, doesn't really quite work with Discworld and in part I'm very glad they decided to go with live action for other adaptations.  The intro music is particularly catchy IMO however, and there are a couple of extras on the DVDs including what appears to have been their initial promo to sell the idea to the networks.  Kinda neat.

There's no doubt that the liver action movies are better, but these aren't bad.  Recommended for any Discworld fans of course, and if you're a Discworld completest you probably already got these anyway!",1386979200,,1500,4.615094339622641

I would have liked it more if they had used Paul Kilby's illustrations in the movies themselves, rather than just the cover.  They were good long movies with a lot of good dialogue from the books, so Terry Pratchett fans should enjoy this  as long as they are willing to be open to a visual interpretation that might be different from their imagination, and are old enough to remember the days before HD television!  Also, it might be my own fault, but I was not aware the DVDs were going to be used - although they seem in good shape.

They are staying very close to the books as they make these, so I don't think that true Pratchett fans will be disappointed in that regard.  What won't make them happy is the poor animation and the failure to really capture the personalities as created by Pratchett.

3447517,3,B001ADXWYM,"These are animated versions of two of Terry Pratchett's popular fantasy-satire novels. Wyrd Sisters is a send-up of Shakespeare's Hamlet with some Macbeth thrown in. Soul Music, part of a series of books (with Reaper Man, Mort, and The Hogfather; my favorites of TP's work!) about the surprisingly human Grim Reaper of Discworld, introduces Death's teenage ""granddaughter"" Susan, who is awakened to the knowledge of her heritage when ""Grandad"" takes a holiday. Will she do her duty in Grandad's place, or will she defy fate and try to save a doomed handsome young musician?

These animated adventures were apparently made for British television in the 1990's and resemble Saturday morning cartoons. Wyrd Sisters is in the form of a movie, while Soul Music is presented in a series of 30 minute episodes. The animation quality is no better than you would expect for a low budget cartoon, but the dialog is well done and manages to capture a lot of the humor and puns from the books. Christopher Lee is the perfect voice of Death, and the rest of the voices are acceptable. If you are an American fan you will enjoy hearing the various British dialects. The original ""music with rocks in"" from Soul Music is quite good. Sound quality can be a bit iffy. If you are looking for a Terry Pratchett adaptation with higher production values, try the live-action ""The Hogfather.""",1331856000,,1370,4.854700854700854

Wyrd Sisters is a play on Shakespeare's Hamlet and will leave you in stiches the whole time.

In Soul Music Death disappears and his granddaughter must step into the roll.  Hilarity ensues as Susan stumbles her way through her duties, Death tries whatever he can to learn to actually forget, and a strange new form of music washes across the Disc leaving groupies in its wake.

The storylines are reasonable depictions of the book, with the three witches right out of ""MacBeth"" and wonderfully entertaining.

The twopack wasn't that expensive, and worth watching more than once.

Not the highest quality animation, but very entertaining for all that - if you enjoy Discworld novels or Pratchet's satire and humor in general you'll enjoy these unless animation is a severe put-off.

3447522,5,B001ADXWYM,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld is a scream!  Take a journey through a fantasy world shaped like a pancake on the backs of four elephants on the back of a giant turtle gliding through space!  Although the animation quality isn't the highest, it's not bad, and the voices for the characters are great.  There are two animated movies in this set, based on novels by Terry Pratchett.

Wyrd Sisters -- The original novel is one of the first of the witches of Lancre stories in the Discworld series. It parodies MacBeth, starting with the three witches planning when they shall meet again (""I'm free next Tuesday!""). Before the witches' meeting ends, a desperate messenger comes running up to them with a baby in his arms. He is killed before he can tell them anything, but the crown that accompanies the baby tells them what they need to know -- the king of Lancre has been murdered and the baby is his son, who must be protected from the king's evil, usurping cousin. Watch as the ghost of the murdered king tries to tell others what happened and torment his cousin with practical jokes and as Granny Weatherwax tries to understand how drama works.

Soul Music -- Death (who has cameo appearances in practically all the Discworld books) has his own set of stories. In this one, Death is seriously depressed by the deaths of his adopted daughter and her husband (see the novels to learn about that relationship). Death, in his despair, takes a holiday to try to forget. Since there always has to be someone in the role of Death, the job falls to Death's granddaughter, Susan. Susan, who doesn't remember much about Death because her parents were trying to live a normal life, is shocked when she gets handed the scythe by Death's assistants. Worse still, one of her next assignments is supposed to be the young musician (specializing in ""music with rocks in"") she has a crush on. If Death couldn't save Susan's parents, how can she save him? (Don't worry, it's not as tragic as it sounds. Death is a much better musician than your average skeleton in a black cloak.)",1316908800,,2058,4.658402203856749

world of a giant sea turtle, with four elephants on it's back, with a large disc on the backs of the four

It s set into short, about 1/2 hour chapteers, allowing for eaasy access to any part of the film where you lleft off. I liked that feature a lot. Life pops in so easily, it seems, and picking up where you left off is handy.

The story is a magic takeoff on the classic tale of a boy going to the big city to become a star. Will, this kid does with a vengance! Whenh hhis harp is accidentally broken he buys a magical replacement, which leads him to mega-stardom when he brings ""music with rocks in"" to the Disc. The music is a rapid run through the history of rock and roll, from Buddy Holly to the Beatles to Hendrix.  It is all fun, but with danger and death (or shuuld I say DEATH) around the corner. Death's grand daughter is the love interest and the story crashes along to the conclusion.

Many laughs and lots of fun.

3447529,2,B001ADXWYM,"As any Terry Pratchett fan, I have of course read the books before watching the movies or playing the videogames. The impact of this movie is under the impact of the book. I am a professionnal inbeetweener for animation films, and it is probably what made my disapointment in front of this movie. It is strictly correctly adapted, following the same sceneray, the exact dialogs. It just looks like a book read by very brittish voices. But the animation is very poor, even the drawings themselves look like a cheat, there are several scenes used several times in the movie but with different dialogs. I do appreciate it has been made years and years ago, but it was not the birth of animation, and here even the colours are not attractive at all.

And above all I would say this adaptation is strictly LIKE reading the book as it is very long and perfectly matching almost every line of a book. So this movie is clearly for Terry Pratchett's fans, only adults as it is defenitely not an adaptation for kids, and it is just as reading the book out loud with coloured pictures to illustrate it.

Not perfect, not really what you could expect for an animated movie adaptation.",1236729600,7,1172,4.576190476190476
3447530,3,B001ADXWYM,"To start off, I am a big Discworld fan...But these movies left me wanting more.  Like others have said, the cover makes it look better than it is.  The animation almost looks 2D vs 3D.  The animators don't use up to date techniques.  ""Soul Music"" is better than ""Wyrd Sisters"", but could also use some updating.  I expected more from the cover and from Pratchett.  The movie does bring the series to life, which is entertaining in itself.

On the other hand, the movie ""The Hogfather"" is not animated and is AWESOME.  I hope that any future Discworld movies are either live action or have much better animation than ""Wyrd Sisters & Soul Music"".",1231977600,2,644,4.587719298245614
3447531,2,B001ADXWYM,"The excellent artwork on the cover is misleading; the animation (at least as far as 'Wyrd Sisters' is concerned) is not even remotely as good as the artwork. If only!

On the positive side, the animated ""film"" of Wyrd Sisters is faithful to Pratchett's excellent Discworld novel of the same name. Many of the best lines are preserved and much of great dialogue is captured. That's nice, but that's about it. No kidding.

On the negative side, where do I begin? The actual characterizations themselves don't seem at all faithful to those of the book. Nanny Ogg was too pushy, too tall, appeared to have all her teeth, and was not deliciously crude enough. Magrat was much too airheaded, giggly, and astonishingly stupid--in the books she is charmingly uptight and unsure of herself, but always earnest and thoughtful in terms of her personality. She may be a ""wet hen,"" but she never comes across as a complete blithering idiot in the books! Granny Weatherwax was perhaps closest to Pratchett's classic character, but too reserved and without any of the secretly lovable undercurrent of Granny's unbending, stern demeanor. Yeah, yeah...I know: the performers were ""interpreting"" the characters.

Big deal.

No matter what the voice-over actors may or may not have done, nothing could possibly save 'Wyrd Sisters' from atrociously cheap animation (not even on par with a bad 1980s Saturday morning kid's cartoon!), horrible pacing (it plods like a lame turtle), and rotten editing (herky-jerky doesn't begin to describe this mess). I mean it. 'Wyrd Sisters' absolutely bores to tears, despite the aforementioned attempts by the cast to do the best they could. It's not Pratchett's fault--that is certain.

'Soul Music', on the other hand, is simply much better, much more flowing, and worth the price of this whole DVD, particularly for die-hard fans. It really is.

There you have it: a definite mixed-bag.",1228521600,68,1905,5.0702875399361025
