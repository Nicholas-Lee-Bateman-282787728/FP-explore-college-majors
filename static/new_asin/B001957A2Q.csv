3422634,5,B001957A2Q,Glad to see Kristen Renton again...one of the new faces on NBC's Days Of Our Lives. I cannot wait to see her in more films as she is proving to be an upcoming star in Hollywood.,1217894400,,177,3.9444444444444446

8271907,1,B001957A2Q,"Glad I bought this as a bargain; the acting is fearful in the sense of atrocious, the special effects humdrum, and the entire premise rather absurd. Seldom has a horror flick engaged less of my attention.",1374019200,,204,4.694444444444445
8271908,3,B001957A2Q,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons: 1) I like the actress Kristen Renton and 2) I like cheesy, low-budget D-horror flicks. It definitely fit the bill. It was laughably bad but at the same time, enjoyable and I ended up liking Kristen's character Jenn and thanks to this movie, James DeBello has a new stalker - I mean, FAN lol It was one of those movies that's so bad its almost good. And I only paid $4.99 for it (which is a rental fee at Blockbuster these days) so I can't complain too much lol",1289347200,2,495,4.166666666666667
8271909,1,B001957A2Q,"If you're a gamer, you probably think ghouls have a paralyzing touch, sometimes smell really bad, and eat corpses.  If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, you probably think ghouls meep and gibber, live in underground dens, and eat corpses.  If you're director Gary Jones, ghouls are badly pixilated smears that float around during the day until they get bored and swoop down to eat people.  Ghoulish? Yes.  Ghouls?  Not so much.

But then, every Syfy channel monster movie puts its own spin on hackneyed monsters and Ghouls has every right to tweak the formula.  In this case, the ghouls are actually guardians of a dark race that was imprisoned by druids.  That's right, druids.  Every 1,500 years there is a grand conjunction in which the ghoul queen, who has been body hopping for years, can bring her banished people back from the beyond.  As each body wears out, she hops to a new, younger one, but the pesky conjunction happens to be right after the old broad bites it. Thing is, the next body must be of the same bloodline, which means it's a bit of a bummer if the ghoul queen happens to be your grandma.

Such is the plight of poor Jennifer (Kristen Renton, wandering off the set of Days of Our Lives), her father Stefan (cackling William Atherton) and his girlfriend Liz (Erin Gray, wandering WAY off the set of Buck Rogers). Returning for the funeral, Jennifer discovers she's the chosen one.  Meanwhile, the last of the druids, Thomas (the positively awful James DeBello dressed in Van Richten monster hunter garb) fires shotguns (?) and throws phosphorous grenades (!) at the aforementioned ghouls.  It never seems to do any good - being that the ghouls are ghosts most of the time, shotguns don't seem like the wisest choice - but good old Thomas never changes tactics.

In fact, Thomas is so enamored with shooting that when some of the cultists start firing on him Thomas shouts ""SHOOT!"" Now call me crazy, but it seems to me that if you're being shot at, you don't shout ""SHOOT!"" You probably shout ""AAAH!"" or more likely an expletive.  But ""shoot""? Not a good choice.

Ghouls is filled with bad choices.  Jennifer witnesses a ghoul noshing on a corpse's entrails, and then whines about the possibility of spiders in a mausoleum - cause that's MUCH scarier.  One of the cultists gets blown up by Thomas' ever ready grenades, only to run past the camera completely unharmed and without burn makeup.  The ghouls, who savagely tear people apart, knock Thomas out for no other reason than to have him show up at the end to rescue the damsel in distress.

If Ghouls has any redeeming qualities, it's that when the scary spirit-smudges become corporeal, the makeup job is actually quite good. But then someone throws a grenade, someone else forgets to be burned by it, and we're back to being reminding that this movie is terrible.

In Dungeons & Dragons the only thing worse than a ghoul is its smellier cousin the ghast.  Ghasts stink so bad that you vomit uncontrollably. Calling this film ghoulish gives it too much credit.  Since it stinks, let's go with ""ghastly"".",1283126400,,3078,4.701492537313433
8271910,5,B001957A2Q,"It got routinely trashed by imdb, and alot of ppl.  Granted I liked Gigli too, but for a good reason (it had an honest look at homosexuality, that wasn't formulaic or PC, which is probably why it bombed).

Why do I like it? Well, for one, I'm a sucker for hot women in movies, I like slightly campy fantasy/sci-fi films, and it did have an original plot. In a tradition of very repetitive or derived films, it's a very good thing to have something fresh. In fact, personally, unless the film is trying to push some stupid philosophy (like fatalism), it's quality is secondary to its originality.  But that's not the real reason.

There are countless good versus evil films, but far too many of them are Christian perspective, or worse deeply fundamentalist Christian perspective.  I myself am Christian, but I accept other faiths as valid.  Seriously, no more Armageddon stories, or demon possessions. So it is refreshing to see a supernatural evil from other myths.  I liked Ringu for the same reason, it had some cultural background from the Japanese concepts on curses.  And the ending was a bit of a twist, which was enough to win it over to my line of thinking. Plus, even the campiness worked in its favor. (I mean c'mon, throwing holy handgrenades at supernatural creatures?)",1279670400,5,1282,4.743243243243243
8271911,5,B001957A2Q,This is a good B movie.  Has an actual story line and the ghouls are cool.,1249430400,,74,3.625
8271912,5,B001957A2Q,"Renton is an up and coming star, and this movie was one of the better sci-fi originals i've seen lately. It wasn't lame and it was pretty scary. If you like sci-fi/horror, I would recommend this one.",1222214400,3,199,4.405405405405405
8271913,1,B001957A2Q,"I've been watching this steaming pile of feces on tv for 85 minutes and I just can't take it any longer. Well, that's not entirely true. I've mostly been watching a cricket on the outside of my window. It has moved so little that I'm not sure it's alive, but it's way more interesting than Ghouls. Better plot and dialog, much more realistic special effects. I could tell you what's wrong with this flick, but I value my sanity too much to think about it. Besides, it's so easy to tell you what's right about it: nothing. Not a thing. Nada. Zip. It's not that I don't like z grade horror movies. I've cheerfully rented and then bought many horror flicks so bad that I would be ashamed to name them. But even I have some standards. Excuse me now, I have to go whack myself on the head with a big hammer until I forget all about this horrible flick.",1220659200,6,847,4.267080745341615
8271914,1,B001957A2Q,"Ghouls (Gary Jones, 2008)

Oh, William Atherton. Long ago was the time when your name on a production meant quality. Nowadays, it seems to do exactly the opposite. (Hmm, maybe The Last Samurai WASN'T Tom Cruise's fault?

...naah.) So when your name popped up in the opening credits of Ghouls, I pretty much knew what I was in for. I just didn't expect it to be this awful.

In any case, the painfully thin synopsis is that Atherton plays Stefan. Stefan's mom dies in the old country, and he rounds up his college-aged daughter Jen (the eye-popping Kristen Renton) and girlfriend Liz (Erin Gray-- yes, that Erin Gray) and they all head for some small, nameless country in Eastern Europe where the entire country shuns the village, and the entire village shuns them. Except, of course, for the family members-- and they're none too friendly, either. Things get a bit less dull when Jen runs into Thomas (James DeBello), a druid who's fighting the ghouls that haunt the town. (No, this isn't a spoiler, we find this out in the film's opening minutes, long before Jen does-- which was probably a bad idea on the part of the scriptwriter.)

Let me start by saying that the only possible reasons to watch this are to stare at Kristen Renton and if you're using it as the basis for a drinking game. Otherwise, give it the widest berth possible. Painful plot holes, inconsistent (and incompetent) characters, truly awful dialogue, the works. And, if I may be allowed a moment of sheer geekery, one should not call one's wraiths ""ghouls"", though these particular CGI monstrosities seem to be able to take either form at will. DeBello, who I thoroughly enjoyed in Cabin Fever, comes off here as a sort of low-rent Ray Liotta or Liev Schreiber (both of whom, I'm sure, turned this down and ran screaming, if it was offered to them), while Renton seesaws between disbelief and amusement (not at the events onscreen, at the script and the direction).

While in the annals of Sci-Fi Channel Original Films, this will not go down in history as the worst movie they've ever bankrolled (you'd have to sink a lot lower than this to get to the level of The Bone Eater), but it's in the bottom ten somewhere. Entirely awful. (half)",1219190400,10,2211,4.673521850899743
