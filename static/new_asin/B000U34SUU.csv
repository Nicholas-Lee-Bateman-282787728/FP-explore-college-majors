8410591,1,B000U34SUU,"Admittedly, I didn't last more than ten minutes, but that's all I give a film. The movie has some EXTREMELY cheap looking fire and writhing figures that wouldn't look out of place an old movie-of-the-week. The cops are chasing the bad guy with their guns in the high-ready position -- through a Mardi Gras parade and NO body notices them.",1513209600,,338,4.65
8410592,4,B000U34SUU,"NIGHT TRAP (aka: MARDI GRAS FOR THE DEVIL- 1993) opens w/ a man named Bishop (Michael Ironside- SCANNERS, VISITING HOURS, STARSHIP TROOPERS) performing some sort of satanic ritual in, what looks like, hell's waiting room. The scene switches to New Orleans, during Mardi Gras, where Bishop is busy murdering people. Thankfully, the police have been watching, and are quickly on his trail. Officer Mike Turner (Robert Davi) and his partner have Bishop cornered in no time. Uh oh! Bishop displays some seemingly impossible abilities that render Turner baffled, and his partner, dead! Bishop also gives Turner a bizarre, time-sensitive ultimatum. W/ his boss, Captain Hodges (John Amos- BEASTMASTER) doubting his story, and his ex-wife (Lesley-Anne Down) on his mind, Turner soon finds himself in a cat-and-mouse chase w/ Bishop. In this case, it's more like the mouse is chasing the cat, since Bishop continues to perform death-defying, superhuman stunts! His murder spree continues as well. Attempting to protect Bishop's next victim, Turner encounters a mysterious woman (Margaret Avery) who enlightens him as to just how eeevil Bishop truly is! Turner begins to realize that he will need more than bullets to deal w/ Bishop. He learns some essential, incredible  information from Hodges that could explain things. Can Turner stop his nefarious nemesis before he destroys everyone he loves? NIGHT TRAP is one of the best supernatural action / thrillers I've ever seen! Davi is superb in his role, and Bishop is the wicked character that Ironside was born to play! The only thing that keeps this from being a masterpiece is the rather anticlimactic finale. Still, the rest of the movie is fantastic!...",1511049600,2,1700,5.227106227106227
