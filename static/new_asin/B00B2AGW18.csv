5552949,3,B00B2AGW18,"Nice to see a take on the ""real world"" aspect of this industry.  These folk are everyday people working hard to live a dream and feed their families.  I especially enjoyed the bonus disc material and after watching, wished the main feature were structured the same.  Buy it for the bonus disc alone.",1365638400,,299,4.60377358490566
8561298,5,B00B2AGW18,Amazing to hear the stories from these miniature effects masters! Great behind the scenes photos. CGI has ruined filmmaking.,1487808000,,124,5.578947368421052
8561299,1,B00B2AGW18,"Bum DVD. As soon as I opened the box I could hear a disc rattling around inside the case. Once opened I saw the second (Bonus) Disc had come loose from it's holder and was scratched horribly. The second disc was still secure, but the rub is the Bonus disc plays fine all the way through and the main feature (disc 1) won't play past 48 minutes. The main disc appears to be unscratched - I suppose I just received a bad copy. Tried in multiple dvd players so I know it's not a hardware fault.",1487721600,,491,4.125
8561300,5,B00B2AGW18,Loved this... My best friend from childhood is a model maker.  And although he is not on this show I am sure most anyone has seen his work.  So I have a huge appreciation for model makers and this is a great summery of where the industry was and includes some great memories of some true artist.,1471478400,,295,4.157894736842105
8561301,5,B00B2AGW18,Very interesting documentary for people interested in special effects history. Plenty of historical information and insight into miniatures and model making for motion pictures. I definitely recommend this to anybody who is a fan of models making and movie effects.,1470787200,,265,5.65
8561302,2,B00B2AGW18,"I was really expecting plenty of behind the scenes photos and footage of the effects being done, instead, you get pretty much nothing but talking heads with little to no pics or footage! Very disappointing!",1468281600,,206,4.914285714285715
8561303,5,B00B2AGW18,"Sense of Scale is unique among special effects documentaries in that Berton Pierce has given the miniature artists a chance to speak at length about their experiences without having all their information reduced to small sound bites. The background photos from different productions are stunning, many never seen before by the public. Mr. Pierce has created a document that both celebrates and mourns the loss of handcrafted art in an age of CGI over saturation. I sincerely hope that there is a Sense of Scale II in the future. Keep up the good work.",1466121600,,551,4.872340425531915
8561304,5,B00B2AGW18,Love this docu! Nothing like it has come before. So sO appreciative and happy that these great artists were chronicled and officially and comprehensively documented for the future going forward. Thanks! : ),1465257600,,206,5.2727272727272725
8561305,5,B00B2AGW18,"very interesting to a limited audience, but those of us who love miniatures in the movies will love it",1424995200,,102,4.421052631578948
8561306,4,B00B2AGW18,I was hoping to see more raw footage of model construction.  Instead it was a lot of recollections and photos from the original model makers.  This is awesome too - don't get me wrong.  Its a great product - its just that I was hoping for more footage of how the models were built.  I enjoyed both the film and the extras!  You'll definitely enjoy it!  It just caught me off guard is all and that's why it gets 4 stars and not 5.,1417910400,,429,4.0476190476190474
8561307,5,B00B2AGW18,"I loved the interviews with the artists that helped create some of the best movies from my childhood. I wish that practical effects were not so out of fashion. maybe I am old, but the craftsmanship of film making is dying.",1396828800,,222,4.439024390243903
