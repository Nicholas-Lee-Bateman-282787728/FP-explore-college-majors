6200563,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"RECIPE FOR LOW BUDGET DISASTER MOVIE:
Take one brilliant scientist who detects a cataclysmic hole in the ozone but no one believes him;
Add a corporate exec who thinks he has a better solution;
Mix in the genius' estranged wife and teen daughter who thinks he doesn't pay them enough attention;
A dash of the dedicated assistant who suffers from diabetes and unrequited love for the doctor;
Place all ingredients in a fog shrouded enclosure and freeze for 90 minutes.
As in most ""cautionary"" tales, man conquers the elements.  ARCTIC BLAST is okay but nothing extraordinary.  Acting is average and the fog is fluffy if not especially ominous.  If you don't expect too much, you shouldn't be disappointed.",1305417600,7,704,4.9491525423728815
6200564,4,B00HRK4K3Y,"Well, I'm almost certain the science is suspect, most what-if stories are.  I didn't mind that.  The plot is pretty standard: smart scientist (Michael Shanks) identifies a problem, there's a pompous boss (Bruce Davison) who discounts it.  The problem becomes undeniable.  They need a solution.  Smart guy has it, stupid boss wants it done his way, he's wrong....  They even threw in the prerequisite global warming rant. AND! The poor scientist/hero is beset with an overwhelming number of things to deal with besides the impending DOOM; as in wife and daughter problems and the aforementioned dope of a boss.  There's even more than that but even with complications, this is not a complicated disaster flick.  It is what it is, there is a whole genre of like movies (most of which I have in my collection: Absolute Zero & the Day After Tomorrow for example).  I love disaster movies, even though they are by nature unrealistic.  That's exactly why I love them.  They are beyond the worst case scenario.  They are THE END OF THE WORLD!  And then some.  This neatly falls into that category.  Is it a good movie?  Of course not.  Did I like it?  Yes.  It's a keeper.  I can easily watch this stupid movie multiple times.  If you like dopey/bad disaster movies you might like this.  I paid 10 bucks for it and consider that money well spent.",1302739200,64,1339,4.681034482758621

After re-watching Gordon Yangs Metal Tornado I decided I needed to go back and watch another film he produced called Arctic Blast. This like the other is a disaster flick which has always been a style of film I have enjoyed. I really like them it seems if they are these SYFY Channel type B movies. Then of course my boy Michael Shanks stars here so that it a plus.

After a tear in the ozone layer opens up super cold mesosphere air leaks in and starts to spread across Earth. The chill is enough to kill instantly so physicist Jack Tait [Shanks] is on a mission to find a way to stop it and keep all he knows and loves safe. But with time running out as well as getting no help from city officials Jack may not be able to do a thing about it.

I had a feeling going in I would like this since Jason Bourgue wrote this who has written some good B stuff. He wrote the Lou Diamond Phillips starring Metal Tornado as well as a few films in the Man eater Series. He also directed the LDP starring Termination Point and speaking of directing I thought Brian Trenchard-Smith did a good job here. You might know him as the director of Night of the Demons 2 and Leprechaun 2 & 3. These two together made for a really great TV flick on SyFy and along with a good cast I really enjoyed it.

Of course you know I loved my boy Michael Shanks in this as well as the rest of the cast. Plus it doesnt hurt that I am a big fan of these end of the world flicks. I really wish more than anything we could have got a commentary on the DVD. With the director, writer, Shanks, any of them separately or together. Still regardless this was a fun flick that is a good waste of an afternoon.",1394064000,2,1681,4.084848484848485

6200601,1,B00HRK4K3Y,"First indicator of cheap - no subtitles. Same writer that gave us ""Metal Tornado"" which also had no subtitles for hard of hearing or viewers with English language difficulties. They also copied an almost identical script from ""Ice Quake"" -  they just changed a few details and then reshot.
Second indicator, again a lot of bad science  such as how the Moon, passing at around 200,000 miles from Earth, affects our Sun which is around 90 million miles away. And, it's been doing this monthly for billions of year, so why did this monthly event suddenly create a cold Earth atmospheric funnel - pure hogwash (sorry hogs). As for the writing/editing research script writers? You wonder what they were doing during middle school science class - doodling?
Third indicator, the CGI manipulation of CO2 water condensation clouds portrayed as the Earth menace is nothing remarkable; ask any elementary/middle school science student. Cheap CGI identical copies of one weather balloon to look like hundreds, all were computer generated as well as most of the other space effects. they all just looked fake. The usual room with lots of computer monitors and pretend science graphics (e.g. child-like drawing of an atmospheric ""hole""). Again an often used cheap movie prop.
Fourth indicator, usual dysfunctional family relationship between teen and father with the expected teen coming around to help save the day. Same hook was used in ""Metal Tornado"" and ""Ice Quake"" both science rubbish movies. Written in for money-making demographic (appeal to all age and family categories) purposes.
Fifth indicator, usual discord between scientists and business types (usually represented as Americans) and the usual military stuff (jets, carriers, missiles) as an often used plot and script filler found in these type movies. Usual panic scenes showing inexperienced extras with an overly rehearsed robotic running style when the director yells - run. The always predictable, end-of-the-world hardware store panic buying spree, e.g. lots of close ups of panic flashlight buying.
Sixth, for some reason most of the scientists' dialogue sounds like high school level, not very intelligent, gossip, but with a few oddly placed ""science"" terms interspersed. All bizarrely & totally out of character.",1346630400,,2275,5.316666666666666
6200602,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"Arctic blast sees man's tampering with the environment causing huge columns of icy air to descend from the upper atmosphere. If you're a fan of zero-budget TV disaster films, you know this was already the plot of the far superior Category 7: The End of the World. In this movie however, the supercooled air does not cause tornadoes- instead it literally freezes everything and everyone it touches, from extremely still buildings that can have icicles digitally painted onto them to the horny boyfriend of the hero's daughter. Since these movies tend to follow a very predictable formula, I will break this one down into its base parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Michael Shanks! Who didn't love him as the brainy and surprisingly brawny Dr. Danial Jackson in Stargate: SG1? And now he's a more traditional science fiction hunky scientist. I predict he'll be wearing an explorer suit with little shorts and fighting giant ants in the jungle before his career is out. Shanks seems bored nearly to tears for this whole film, but that's sort of his acting method so it's hard to say how much he's really investing in his role.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Immense! If we keep depleting the ozone layer we will be frozen to death, EVEN IN AUSTRALIA. It's like On The Beach only with bad weather, people.

Carnage:
Middling. The only stuff that really gets arctic blasted are things that were pretty motionless anyway and we don't see much of environments after their flash-freezing.

Awful Effects:
Pretty bad. The Deadly pillars of freezing air don't look like much, nor is the freezing of Australia very interesting to look at. But how interesting can you make a big spooky cloud?

Romantic Subplot:
Decent. Shanks is surrounded by slightly above average ladies and eventually when the seemingly unstoppable weather disaster is averted, he hooks up with one of them. I'd rather they just leave these bits out, but TV disaster film law 115 says there MUST be a romance of some kind. There's also a doomed romance between Shanks' characters' daughter and her wuss boyfriend.

Big Action Truck:
Shanks tools around in a Hilux Invincible, the same truck James May drove up a volcano in Top Gear, and May and Clarkson drove to the North Pole. As you might imagine, it laughs at nature's puny attempts to kill it here too. Also apparently its heater is strong enough to protect a person from weather that can flash-freeze the ocean. Go Toyota!

i would recommend Arctic Blast as background noise while you work, or maybe something to put on so the significant other in your life will get bored and make out with you instead of watching TV, but as a movie it's kind of a stinker. It gets 3 stars because I love Michael Shanks glowering at stuff, but there are better disaster movies out there, not to mention better WEATHER disaster movies, and for that matter, better made for TV weather disaster movies. And that's a pretty narrow niche to still lose in, Arctic Blast.",1344902400,,2955,4.793713163064833
6200603,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"I got my copy of ""Arctic Blast"" in a Wal-Mart $5.00 bin so it wasn't a major investment.  Most of the other reviews have given the standard information and I think they are accurate.  The special effects are ok; fog isn't as scary as flooding water, or lava etc. but the movie does hold your attention while it goes through the standard low budget complications these movies share.  One thing nice about it; it's filmed in Tasmania and Australia  so the scenery being frozen is different.  There are a few standard disaster around the planet shots, Big Ben, Golden Gate, etc. but most of the location work is a plus for being a bit different. I will watch it again some night when I can use a little arm chair adventure.",1343952000,2,720,4.465648854961832
6200604,5,B00HRK4K3Y,"i have seen this movie a few times on my local pay television station and i decided it was time for me to my own copy of this movie,because i do not know when the movie will ever come back on the pay television channel again.",1335139200,,225,3.9130434782608696
6200605,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"Michael Shanks plays Jack Tate aka the hero in this disaster movie. When a solar eclipse sends a colossal blast of super chilled air towards the earth, it then sets off a catastrophic chain of events that threatens to engulf the world in ice and begin a new Ice Age.

To me it was just a different disaster where it kills millions or billions and of course its the man with relationship issues with his daughter and wife and his boss pretty much don't believe a word he says.....until of course when the bosses idea doesn't work than his solution is good enough. Its always seems to be the dude that is so committed to his job that his family starts to hate him for it but when he goes, ""you know you guys are more important and I will do this and that"" and than they are like...""oh well keep your job"". Of course now since he saved your life and everyone's life, why would you get a divorce? Just because a person is so committed to his job doesn't mean that he don't care about his family too. And if he didn't have that job oh look you would have been dead. Apparently it only takes a disaster to fix marital problems and makes everything else so better....
Hahahahahahahahaha really in that case I need a damn disaster! Fix my problems!!!!

Its an ok movie I guess, not the best movie but it wasn't horrible. Pretty sure it be the one I will pop in when I need a nap :)!!",1328140800,,1375,4.224334600760456

6200607,1,B00HRK4K3Y,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen and I love Michael Shanks, but he couldn't save this mess.  I'm a diabetic so when they gave an insulin injection to a woman suffering from excessively low blood sugar, I was just shocked--that would kill you 100%!  Did these people do no research for this film?  Also, the special effects were terrible and there were so many plot holes that it was laughable.  And that's what I  mostly did--laugh my way through this horrible film.  Do NOT waste your money on this junk.  It wasn't even worth the $5.00 I spent on it.",1321660800,7,558,4.411764705882353

Yep we destroyed the ozone it was the only thing protecting us from the coldest place on earth (fifty to a hundred kilometers above), well maybe with the exceptions of Jack's wife (Alexandra Davies) and Jack's brat (Indiana Evans.) Now toss in an eclipse and only Jack Tate (Michael Shanks) sees the ""hole"" problem and hopefully the solution.

In the end will they listen to jack's solution? In the end will they learn to work with Mother Nature? In the end will Jack's cutie co-worker, Zoe (Saskia Hampele) get Jack or be left out in the cold? Will we ever get tired of these mediocre disaster movies? (Not me)",1315094400,18,740,4.826771653543307
6200609,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"Like all self-respecting disaster movies, Arctic Blast starts out with a narrator giving us some scientific facts that will prove quite relevant for all that is to follow.  The coldest place on Earth, we are told, is not the North or South Pole but the Mesosphere (some fifty to a hundred kilometers above sea level), where the temperature is well under a hundred degrees below zero (Fahrenheit).  After this brief introduction, though, the science of Arctic Blast quickly changes into something the writers came up with in their imagination (much like the pseudo-science of global warming).  For reasons no one ever even attempted to explain, a full solar eclipse somehow causes a rift in the ozone layer that quickly becomes a really big hole in the ozone.  Now maybe you're thinking such a hole in the ozone is going to cause temperatures to increase and result in all kinds of nasty consequences from an overabundance of ultraviolet rays rushing down to the Earth's surface.  Sorry - but you're quite wrong.  What actually happens is that the hole in the ozone layer allows the freezing temperatures in the higher Mesosphere to come pouring down to Earth through the hole, resulting in an ever-expanding wave of deadly cold frost and fog.  We're talking really, really cold here - cold enough to flash freeze every human (and virtually everything else) it comes in contact with.

It's obvious what such a dire situation calls for: a rogue-ish scientist having a serious relationship problem with a wife or girlfriend brought on by his over commitment to his job and under commitment to his family.  Luckily, we have just such a guy down in southern Australia, only a few hundred miles from the location of the rift.  Not only is Jack Tate (Michael Shanks) dealing with a wife asking for a divorce and an alienated daughter, he also has a boss who doesn't want to hear his ideas despite the fact he's the best man in his field.  Clearly, Jack Tate is the man for the job.  He is the first person to understand what is happening, but no one believes his warnings of a killer cold front coming straight for Australia - not until flash-frozen human popsicles start littering the island of Tasmania.  Does his boss listen to him then?  Of course not.  He cuts Jack completely out of the loop and comes up with his own cockamamie scheme for repairing the damage to the ozone layer.  Meanwhile, more rifts start popping up all over the globe, taking on more and more of the appearance of a mass extinction event.

Really, this is a great idea for a low-budget disaster movie.  Heck, all you really need are some great big smoke and fog machines, and you've got most of your special effects right there on the cheap.  Add in a makeup artist to make a few people look frozen, sprinkle a little CGI on top (it's not a disaster movie without at least one explosion), and you're done.  Fortunately, the film also has the good sense to limit its ""we caused this with our pollution"" propaganda to a bare minimum, making it easier to enjoy.  The end result is an exceedingly average disaster flick - an unremarkable yet filling serving in my steady diet of low-budget disaster movies.",1313539200,,3173,4.701627486437613
6200610,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"I have to admit I enjoy disaster movies even if they're bad; while this one isn't really bad it's not great. It has its fair share of clich&eacute;s and stereotypical characters but it has good sound and picture so I can't complain too much.

It has been pointed out about the solar eclipse and the subsequent hole in the ozone layer producing extreme drops in temperature and this is indeed the reason for the story. What has not been pointed out is something of this nature actually happened thousands of years ago. Evidence of this occurrence is found in the studies done of the ""Beresovka Mammoth;"" interesting discoveries were made when the mammoth was examined in Leningrad in the early 1900's.

One of the most interesting discoveries to me was the presence of undigested flowers, ferns, and tropical plants unlike anything found in the Siberian tundra; evidence that the climate when the mammoth was frozen was tropical in nature. Other implications of that discovery was the flash freezing the elephant had to experience to stop the digestive process before the stomach's contents were dissolved as the digestive acids continue to function even though the elephant was dead.

Another important consideration was the fact that the elephant was found at all; this meant that after the initial freezing process, from tropical to sub-zero, the temperature never again rose to a level where the body would decay. I found all of this information to be both revealing and challenging.

The movie descended to soapbox rhetoric on man-made global warming a couple of times but was not nearly as bad as ""The Day After Tomorrow.""

I enjoyed the movie and can recommend it for disaster flick fans.",1313280000,3,1694,4.950704225352113
8634843,3,B00HRK4K3Y,"This was a not-too-bad made for TV movie that I believe aired on the SyFy Channel here in the U.S. As with most of these made-for-tv movies there is not much of a budget here, but I think that the producers did a pretty good job at making it look like a ""real"" movie. To be sure, there is quite a bit of cheap CGI and lousy special effects. Having sat through thousands of sci-fi movies I've seen a lot worse though.

One of the stronger aspects of the movie is its writing. The overall plot is actually somewhat scientifically believable without there being a ton of obvious contradictions in the way of physics, science or overall reality. The dialogue is fairly realistic with no over-the-top stupid moments to speak of. There are definitely no laugh out loud moments in terms of obvious mistakes or horrible acting, which is rare for this genre.

The acting was far above average for a SyFy film. Most of the actors seemed to be ""real"" actors, rather than random people pulled off the street who star in most SyFy movies. Bruce Davison, who has been in some of THE worst movies of all time, actually put-in a pretty decent performance, much to my surprise. It isn't very often that he gets a script that doesn't read like a bad comic book though. Michael Shanks kind of comes across as the poor man's Kevin Costner. He seems to take his role seriously and is competent at his craft. I think that all of the actors were probably greatly helped by having a script that was believable and somewhat relatable to real life.

The movie was certainly entertaining enough to keep my attention without completely insulting my intelligence. With a lot more money and some bigger stars this could have probably done well as mainstream movie. It's budget put a lot of limitations on it though and it shows. On a side note, this was an extremely family friendly film. No swearing, nudity, sexual innuendo or anything even mildly objectionable to speak of by American standards.",1529366400,,1968,4.617142857142857

8634849,4,B00HRK4K3Y,"Fans of Michael Shanks will enjoy this lower budget, somewhat cheesy sci-fi entry.  It's a fun movie.  The only downside is what appears to be a frame-rate issue with the transfer.  There's just a slight 'jitter'.  My best guess is it was mastered in Europe (or New Zealand) at 25fps, then converted to either 24p or 29.97.  It is worth owning",1477612800,,343,4.557377049180328

I loved this movie all the way up until the diabetes crisis.  I don't expect an amazing, movie to end all movies when I watch a disaster movie...I just want it to be entertaining, well written, and well acted. Okay, it may be kind of weird given I'm are already watching a sci-fi movie about a disaster that I am sure scientifically couldn't happen  but the whole diabetic crisis thing drives me nuts because it's soooo wrong.  I think it bothers me because it misinforms people and it would have been so easy to do something more accurate.  First she asks Shanks character to get her some chocolate bars when he goes out THEN later she tells him that she ran out of her insulin two days ago.  Um, yeah, no diabetic is going to be asking for chocolate bars if they ran out of insulin.  Also, if I saw her meter correctly the one time she tested it said 58.  This would fit the needing chocolate bar (which would be a poor choice to begin with) scenario but  DOES NOT fit the out of insulin scenario.  Also, her symptoms don't fit out of insulin but were more of hypoglycemic (low sugar) symptoms.  She also wouldn't have been that close to death after two days of being without her insulin, ill yes, but not like that, particularly not having eaten anything (which is how they treated diabetes before insulin- very low calorie/carb diet).  Insulin wasn't created until 1921, the first US citizen to inject insulin had been diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic three years prior to insulin being invented.  The character in the movie most likely would have been ill and probably have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which would likely have been accompanied with vomiting, frequent urination, and being dry and flushed rather than pale and clammy.  My other issue is the car.....gasoline is hard to freeze but not impossible (particularly at those temperatures) but the car battery, even fully charged, would have frozen and probably would still have been frozen at when Shanks went out.  (And if it managed to unfreeze, it would be highly unlikely to be workable.)

So all the way up to that point the movie was fantastic....That whole diabetic crisis thing.....it bugged me....just a little.... :)",1472428800,3,2254,4.726342710997442
