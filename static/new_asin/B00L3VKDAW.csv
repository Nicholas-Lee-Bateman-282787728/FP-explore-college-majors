I actually went to a screening of it this weekend in Atlanta and was able to see Dr. Umar Johnson and some of the cast speak. Umar Johnson and Tracy Syphax were phenomenal. I wish Killer Mike was present being that we're in his city and all.  But I understand scheduling conflicts and all.

I enjoyed the documentary but for some reason, something was missing. Something I can't put my hands on..  Hopefully Elementary Genocide 2 will expand on it.",1425427200,5,473,4.7317073170731705

6464290,5,B00L3VKDAW,"Elementary Genocide,  should be in every African American/ Latino house hold, It should be studied and discussed within families, and in schools. The video shows clear example/trend of African American/Latino youth  going to prison for things that amounts to adolescent behavior. I really suggest this for Black fathers to discuss with their sons. Elementary genocide is frightening, but at the same time it enlightens us on how a child starts being branded in elemetary school. You get to hear stories of adult Black males, share their stories on how they were treated by these older caucasion teachers, who basically tried to dummy them down, by telling them to aim low. there are so many components to this compelling documentary;  It is a frightening, insightful indictment on the public school system and this growing trend of sending Black/Latino males to prison at an early age. I strongly reccomend this documentary to anyone!",1420156800,45,934,5.172185430463577
