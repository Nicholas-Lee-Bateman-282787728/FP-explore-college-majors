4049129,4,B0031ESNZG,"I have already had this replaced once, and the replacement disc has the same problem. It may only happen on certain DVD players (it has the problem on my Philips DVD player, but it does work OK on my computer). If you do the ""play all"" option (which is certainly the way you want to watch this), starting with episode 3, the sound disappears. If you let it play for a few seconds, then go back to the start of the chapter, it plays OK (and it works if you play as individual episodes), but this was REALLY annoying having to do over and over again each time a new chapter started.
This is too bad, as the show is still very enjoyable. It's nice to see Will Wheaton as the bad guy, and the second disc is packed with extras, including the video ""Do you Want to Date my Avatar"". I hope Amazon gets this problem fixed, as I do recommend this, and I am eagerly looking forward to season 4.",1267574400,,885,4.151162790697675
4049130,5,B0031ESNZG,"I make sure to always, always purchase these DVDs. I also try to drop a couple bucks over at iTunes in addition to downloading the HD vids on Xbox Live and voting for The Guild in The Streamys.

And I'm a normal person! Swear!

There's maybe three comedy shows on actual television that are worth their salt at any given time, most of them created by or inspired by a Ricky Gervais production. If I have to drop 15 bucks a year to keep The Office on the air, I'd do it. So I don't see any reason why I shouldn't do it for The Guild.

Every season always turns out to be a thoroughly enjoyable hour-plus of television, in stand-alone episodic format. And with all the extra features, commentary, etc, it's a solid buy with plenty of rewatchability (because yes, that's a word now).

Can't wait for season 4. Who knew Codex was such a big slut?!

Overall, the season was really good, but I personally liked season two more, and I thought the show was much funnier last year.  This is still a FANTASTIC show, and the show is only looking more and more like a television program every year.

The DVD is fantastic, coming on two DVD-R burned discs with printed faces.  The first disc is episodes and commentary.  The second disc has so many special features.  It includes the ""Do You Want To Date My Avatar"" music video and plenty of making of clips.

I've shown the series to a few friends who weren't into MMORPG's and while certain things had to be explained to them they understood most without any questions and found it just as great as I did.

I think that buying the DVD is a great way to show support for Felicia and all of her cast mates.  Plus I like the idea of supporting something that hasn't sold out to the commercial industrial complex... oh, wait... didn't she make a video about that?

4049145,2,B0031ESNZG,"I. Overview
""The Guild"" is a comedy web series about online gaming written by Felicia Day, who also stars as the main character, Cyd Sherman/Codex. The title refers to a group of gamers, known in the game as ""The Knights of Good,"" who play an MMORPG together and decide to meet each other in person upon Cyd's suggestion. The remainder of the series follows the Knights of Good and their interactions with each other after, both online and offline. The members of the guild refer to each other by the names of their avatars in the game: Codex (the main character, who plays a priestess), Zaboo (a half-Indian, half-Jewish guy who plays a warlock), Vork (a middle-aged stickler for rules who plays a warrior), Bladezz (a cocky and arrogant teenager who plays a rogue), Clara (a negligent mother who plays a mage), and Tinkerballa (a diva Asian girl who plays a ranger). Other characters are introduced at different points in the series, including a rival guild and several minor characters.

II. The Pros
Season I is quite arguably the best season of the entire series. Anyone who has had extensive online gaming experience can relate to the guild and their addictions to the online game they play, which seems to be a fantasy setting similar to that of World of Warcraft (which some members of the cast admit to playing in interviews). Zaboo's infatuation with Codex is amusing and draws sympathy from anyone who has experienced unrequited love. The cast is colorful and there are some truly original moments, as the ""boss battle"" with Zaboo's mother. All in all, the first season leaves us curious to see what will become of this motley crew of gamers.

III. The Cons
Unfortunately, subsequent seasons of ""The Guild"" fail to build upon the great groundwork that is set in the first season. Although there are many directions Felicia Day could have taken to develop her plot, none of the characters experience real growth or change. The result is a stagnant stream of antics where truly amusing moments are few and far between and the underdeveloped characters that surround Codex are little more than one-dimensional caricatures. Zaboo's Steve Urkel-like obsession with Codex borders on nausea, Vork is a hypocrite who professes to do good in the game while committing illegal and unethical acts in reality, Clara makes us wish the police would show up and slap her with cuffs for a disturbingly overt display of child neglect, and Tinkerballa convinces us that the modern woman is a gold-digging, man-eating, potty-mouth lump of vanity.

Codex herself turns out to be no more interesting/appealing than the characters with whom she interacts. Supposedly shy and demure, Codex/Cyd: obstinately demoralizes Zaboo, blackmails a fellow guild member, encourages a fight over herself at a party, assumes control of the guild, defeats a rival guild leader, and engages a sexual relationship with a complete stranger. It is not clear whether the inconsistencies in Codex's character - like those of Vork's - are the result of poor acting, poor scripting, or both.

""The Guild"" also projects an overbearing, feminist overtone. Codex openly pursues other relationships with guys while Zaboo grovels for her attention, Zaboo's brief distraction from Codex with a girlfriend ends when she rejects him for another girl, Bladezz is defaced when his mom has a sexual encounter with a rival guild member, Vork is ""undateable"" and his role as leader is surmounted by Tinkerballa and Clara when they reject his guild hall, and Clara dominates her husband while refusing to interact with the couple's children herself. Clearly, this is a series that lacks any strong male characters. The effect here is an estrogen-saturated view of online gaming that alienates the male audience.

Finally, we never see the actual game that is being played until Season IV, and then only briefly. Up until this point, we see interaction between members of the guild only in real-time - typically, with each character sitting at their respective PC, holding conversation through mic and headphones.

IV. Summary
At first glance, ""The Guild"" appears to be the interesting and untold story of the online gamer's world. Upon deeper inspection, the series does not deliver what it purports to be. Rather, it is a polarized and overreaching attempt to dramatize a popular past-time. Indeed, ""The Guild"" owes its popularity to online gaming itself, rather than the ingenuity of its script or the quality of its performance.",1320105600,2,4483,5.043184885290149
4049146,5,B0031ESNZG,"I only wish the seasons were longer. This show is hilarious and a real treat for gamers. Anyone who knows even a little bit about the ""geek culture"" will enjoy the humor. Felecia Day is adorable!",1318550400,,195,4.444444444444445
4049147,5,B0031ESNZG,"If you are in the gaming culture or love someone who is, you'll love this series.  If you are not, you will probably find it confusing but amusing.",1312243200,,147,4.25

4049151,5,B0031ESNZG,"This Fantastically nerdy mini series just keeps getting better and better. Felicia Day is incredibly talented for how little she had to create this with. Just pure delightful. Easy to fall in love with all of the characters and very hard to stop watching.

4049152,5,B0031ESNZG,The Guild: Season 3 was a Christmas gift for my daughter as I'd never heard of the online series before.  My daughter had me watch all 3 seasons of the series based on a group of online game players who meet and interact in the real world and as their online personas.  It is a great series.  Lots of fun to watch.,1295308800,,314,4.032258064516129
4049153,3,B0031ESNZG,awesome show and series however the dvd won't work on alot of Australian dvd players due to region restrictions,1286236800,,111,4.894736842105263
4049154,4,B0031ESNZG,"The third season of the Guild moves away from the traditional inter-party conflict into new territory - real life. There's the Axis of Anarchy, a rogues gallery of virtual bad guys willing to cross over into real life to conduct their slanderous campaign against their enemies, the Knights of Good. There's Clara's husband George (Brett Sheridan), avatar name Mr. Wiggly, who joins the Knights only to bump into walls.  And there's the continuing power struggle between Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) and Bladezz (Vincent Caso). Their conflicts ring true, especially to anyone who has spent a large chunk of their social life online.

I was part of an online knighthood that opposed a group much like the Axis of Anarchy - and yes, they were quite willing to use real life slander to attack us.  I have witnessed new players become completely, pathetically bewildered in an online digital world that is hostile to newcomers. And I certainly know what it's like to have a power struggle online over a real life romance.

Of course, the joy in watching the Guild is the comedic timing, and if this season has a flaw it's that occasionally the Axis of Anarchy strays beyond Funny Evil and into Scary Dangerous. Bruiser (J. Teddy Garces) is a cop who sleeps with Bladezz' mom...it comes off more menacing than amusing. Riley (Michele Boyd), Zaboo's girlfriend for this season, is so ridiculous abusive to her diminutive boyfriend that it starts to get uncomfortable.

But that doesn't detract from the fun. Felicia Day is at her best when she veers from sweetly neurotic to bravely indignant, but the real gem is Wil Wheaton as Fawkes.  Wheaton, who has been with geekdom since his Star Trek days, has become something of a patron saint for gamers.  He's had a column in Dragon magazine and is an avid gamer himself. Wheaton plays against type here as a cynical, pompous womanizer. Fawkes is considerably less shrill than his fellow guild members, a rogue's gallery of villains akin to the Legion of Doom.

It all ends with a virtual showdown that introduces the walking, talking alternate self of Cyd Sherman as Codex, who also appears in the music video Do You Wanna Date My Avatar. The conflict concludes with a twist that's common for sitcoms but promises a very interesting fourth season for The Guild.",1285200000,,2296,4.854219948849105
4049155,5,B0031ESNZG,"The Knights of Good prepare for a new kind of conflict: the machinations of a rival guild. Dark days are ahead. With a crippled leadership and merciless harrassment, will the Guild survive at all? Cyd Sherman & co. must gather their wits and band together - but that may not be enough. Bear witness to the humor, the fierce exchanges, and even the madness (?) as the Guild struggles for its very existence!",1284681600,,406,4.575342465753424
4049156,5,B0031ESNZG,"The writing, production values, and performances are all top notch. On the surface this DVD appears to have a narrow audience of online gamers. But, I feel the vulnerability of the the Codex character allows people like me who haven't played MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) games to access this world and enjoy the show. Even though you can see these episodes on XBOX LIVE and online for free, I buy these on DVD to reward all the hard work that goes into this production.

4049158,4,B0031ESNZG,"The Guild Season 3 is a fun season of a show born on the web and with a charm all it's own. I love the ""made on a shoestring"" look to the episodes, even as the acting and writing remain top quality. There is an honesty and intimacy to ""The Guild"" that is lacking in more well funded, mainstream shows on television. The extras are excellent too, especially the music video ""Do You Want To Date My Avatar"". Obiviously a lot of thought and effort went into making a first rate dvd offering of Season 3. The only problem is the same one others have reported with the audio. I was disappointed to find when I popped my copy of Season 3 into my dvd player that the first few words of Codex's intro to each episode are inaudible, then the sound will come on and the rest of the episode will play just fine. After reading about other buyers experiences with this apparently widespread quality problem,I probably will not try to return my defective copy. I'll just live with it out of fear the replacement would be just as bad or worse. So five stars for the show and extras, with a deduction of one star for the poor audio.",1279497600,,1116,4.293838862559242
4049159,5,B0031ESNZG,"The cast and crew are amazing! Careful if your ears are sensitive, the Axis of Anarchy have f bombs and they know how to use 'em. But I still love this season none the less. :)",1279152000,,176,3.9166666666666665
4049160,5,B0031ESNZG,"I really cannot complement this show enough. Because this is Season 3 I will assume you are familiar with the premise of ""The Guild."" This review will mostly cover the new additions to the cast and, of course, the plotline. What's become clear in this season is that Felicia and Co. have an excellent eye for casting.

The third season introduces the ""Axis of Anarchy."" This collection of laughably goofy X-treme types are all perfect adversaries for The Knights of Good: a wannabe warrior-poet, a 'roided-out cop with rage issues, an angsty goth diva, a ""professional"" gamer, (complete with gorgeous attendant) and an obviously closeted fabric salesman who never seems to get the cool one-liners quite right. In any other show these misfits would be the heroes struggling against the ""jocks"" or something, but in ""The Guild"" they are the cool kids making life for the hapless Knights of Good quite miserable.

The actors playing members of the Axis do an excellent job. Wil Wheaton's casting may appear to be fanservice, but he does an excellent job as the Axis frontman, Fawkes. I will be very interested to see if Fawke's overblown bravado ends up being a complete sham or if he'll stay the same in Season 4.

It should be said that, as usual, the writing is incredibly solid and the core cast continues to be as loveably flawed as can be. Being partial to Zaboo myself, (sigh...yeah he's the one I relate to) it was hilarious and unexpected to see his manhood crushed and rebuilt in the course of a handful of episodes. Clara's plot was even stronger this year. (why do I feel like Clara really exists somewhere in real life?) Bladezz takes a beating (but I'd really like to see more of his character) and sadly Tink's role is pretty diminished. If I fail to mention the chracters of Vork and Codex it's only because they are their usual hilarious selves. (although Vork's arc takes him out of his comfort zone...and what a small zone that is!)",1278201600,,1948,4.706744868035191

The Axis of Anarchy is a rival guild, who decides to make it their goal to torture Codex's Guild members online and off.  Then, Tink abandons them, Vork decides to quit as Guild leader, and Codex steps up and tries to pull her team back together.

Felicia Day returns as Codex, in season 3 of her satirical webseries about a group of online gamers who meet in the real world.  All of her fun cast mates/guild mates are back as well, this time joined by the evil guild members from the Axis of Anarchy. Leader Fawkes is played by Wil Wheaton, who is ideal for the role.

As the guild members' relationships grow and change, Codex makes it her mission to try to keep her guild from falling apart. Once again, hilarity ensues with eccentric characters, outrageous situations, and plenty of geeky awkwardness. The season is 12 episodes, each 3-8 minutes long, so there's no excuse not to check it out. It's easily one of the best (and funniest) webseries I've ever seen.

I tried it on several different dvd players and it happened on all of them. Was like watching one of those badly dubbed Godzilla movies. I asked for a replacement and the same issue occured with an added bonus!: A very nasty glitch that prevented me from continuting on with the season. No visible scratches or blemishes adorned the disk, so I assume it was in the burning of the disk itsself. Amazon refused to send me a third. I'm not sure of the quality of the dvd itsself.

Felicia Day has done it again with Season 3; continuing her quirky story about geeks. If you like this type of thing you'll love The Guild.  The actors are well cast; the story line is interesting and everyone seems to be having fun.  The world needs more of this low budget, entertaining, no special effects output.

extra excerpts were mainly blooper clips. However this would be the way to watch the show
rather than on the web in 5 minute clips (if you can wait). The story is much more coherent
that way. The only warning is the story is quite addictive! The product is reasonably priced

This follows your favorite Guildies duking it out with a rival Guild ""The Axis of Anarchy"" and boy do they live up to their name.

Now as for the DVD, it came to me in a shiny DVD box with two discs. One for the episodes and commentaries and a second with a lot of extras like the making of stuff and my personal favorites of the ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar"" music video and a video of How to make Vork's sword.

All in all, well worth the price and made this fan boy extremely happy!",1270771200,,572,3.9224137931034484

4049180,5,B0031ESNZG,"I've been a follower of The Guild for quite awhile now, and have purchased all 3 seasons of their Internet shows.

If you are an online World of Warcraft game player, this series of short scenarios which highlight the life of a small group of MMORPG game players who are in the same ""guild"" in the game is funny and very entertaining, or it sure is entertaining for me.

It's very well done, quite creative, and the shows are short.  A whole season at a time on each disk.  I found it well worth buying.",1270598400,,503,4.2631578947368425
4049181,5,B0031ESNZG,"How fun is it to OWN this DVD?  I fell in love with the Guild on YouTubes, but having the whole season, right there, with bonus features.  It's really fun.  Great for games night.  If you aren't an online gamer, but are hooked on a writer's list, a scrapbook chat line, or your YoVille buddies, you will still resonate with the connection these misfits have found online.

Can't wait for season 4!",1270512000,,397,4.458333333333333

4049183,5,B0031ESNZG,"Yet another great season of The Guild. The expansion of the character base with improvements to production quality continue to astound and entertain. We learn more of the characters and their outside lives. Rivalries are born and the repercussion of decisions carries us through a very turbulent third season. Friends and family who aren't even gamers find the series quirky and humorous. The Guild is what it is... something fresh and different, with actors and writers not afraid to march to the beat of their own drum. I hope to see a Season Four in the works and wish the cast and crew continued success.",1269475200,,608,4.8

I have only met a few in real life but if it had not been in game I would never have met some of the great but yet quirky people I have come to depend on for friendship and support.

I love the characters and the actors and it does me good to know that all sort of people you would never expect play games... even tho WOW is not my game.",1268956800,,468,3.727272727272727
4049185,5,B0031ESNZG,"Being casual gamers, my wife and I stumbled on Season One of The Guild by accident and have been hooked ever since. This is not the season to start watching The guild if you haven't already watched the other two (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guild-Seasons-1-2/dp/B002C68WNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guild: Seasons 1 & 2</a>). Season Three of The Guild picks up soon after the events of Season Two, leaving most of the guild members barely on speaking terms.

No spoilers from me; this time around we have Codex (Felicia Day) attempting to rekindle the ""Knights of Good"" sense of unity by finding a common enemy. Things don't go as planned and it makes for some of the best episodes yet.

There are also a lot of extras, my favorite being the ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar"" music video! Just great!

Everyone knows that all of these episones can be found for free elsewhere on the Internet, but buy them here and support these great actors and hopefully they will continue to produce this very enjoyable series. I also like that Amazon included the ""On Demand"" episodes when you buy the DVD (perhaps for a limited time?). This lets us watch it on our PCs or on our TV via our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roku-HD-XR-Player/dp/B002SFDJMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roku HD-XR Player</a>.

She's now married and living elsewhere, but I still loved Season 3 of this show, and hope Felicia and her group make more.

4049187,5,B0031ESNZG,"That was one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  Wil Wheaton was an inspired addition as the Evil in-game opponent.  Definitely a change in mode from the earlier seasons.  Instead of dysfunctional being dysfunctional in largely private spheres of dysfunctionality, this is about tightly knit networks of dysfunctionality.

Plus, bringing the Whedonverse together with Star Trek?  Nerd bliss.",1268524800,2,397,5.55
