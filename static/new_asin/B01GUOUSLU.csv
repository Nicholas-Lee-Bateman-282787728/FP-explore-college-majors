8763555,5,B01GUOUSLU,"Not my favorite opera, but I've listened three nights in a row and very taken by this.  The singing is very VERY big.  I guess this can be done as some kind of chamber opera but the BIG approach seems to reward it.  The big P isn't the most nuanced and tends to just sing out, but hard to complain with this voice.  Maria Chiara is good, I heard her in Trovatore many years ago at San Carlo.  Not the moments of Price or Caballe, but still beautifully sung.  Dimitrova is just a force a nature, this role brings that out in many singers but she is phenomenal.  The damn walls shake.  Juan Pons I've never thought much of, but again, in the BIG concept, he's really good.  Maazel occasionally makes ""points"", but I find that I sort of like some of them.
All told, I'll listen again.",1510185600,,781,4.222972972972973
