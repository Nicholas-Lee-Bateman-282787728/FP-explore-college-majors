461741,5,6302390362,"this movie was so funny and yet its something to think about. He is the president:s first wife,she is the president,the rolls have switched.the kids are terrible and everything goes wrong. I laughed and laughted through this one. Buy this you won""t go wrong!",1377129600,,258,4.886363636363637
461742,4,6302390362,"1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.

Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.

Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.

Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...

Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. ""You silly dupe!"" I heard you say.

One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the ""My mom's the President"" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.

The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: ""So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?"" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.",1376611200,,3750,4.953895071542131

461744,4,6302390362,"This movie has been one I've wanted to see for years, but it seems it was buried in the vaults of Hollywood for some reason. Along with it's too fine stars (Fred McMurray and Polly Bergen), it boasts superior production values. It's set of the White House is very accurate. It didn't do gangbusters at the box office, no doubt because the 1960 election introduced the exciting Kennedys. I'm glad that Warner has given it a second life on a remastered version via DVD .

461746,4,6302390362,"I found ""Kisses for My President"" a thoroughly delightful comedy.  Of course it's dated, but that's part of its charm.  This is a perfect, fun movie to while away a few hours while enjoying a cool drink and a box of bonbons. (-:",1279411200,,228,4.27906976744186
461747,3,6302390362,"Most of the scripting in this movie is really dated, but Polly Bergen does a good job with the material which she had to work with. Of course, this owes to the fact that she is an awesome actor to begin with.

Fred MacMurray gives an equally compelling role as the First Gentleman. Frankly, since he was playing a role which was actually disparaged when this film was made (the idea of a dominant wife/subservient husband was-then scandalous) he deserves additional kudos for having to 'climb uphill'. His character has to put-up with now-riddiculous ideas for anybody but he also comes through the screenplay like a champ.

The sets are really well designed. The production department wanted viewers to feel as if they are in the White House during this film. The viewers are supposed to balance the-then absurdity of a woman president with the reality of the White House looking basically as it should.

The only thing I hated about this movie (again owing to its datedness) was that the President resigns when she is pregnant. There is a somber announcement from the White House as if the president has died or committed a serious crime against the country.  I recognize this film was made when most American companies lacked maternity leave/had pregnancy discrimination, because a pregnancy is now not something we would expect a modern public official to resign for.",1121558400,8,1371,4.896551724137931

461794,4,6302390362,"A movie about a woman president. How can I resist that? It's 1964 and 40 million women have voted for the first ever woman president. (Wouldn't that have been nice?)

She takes over the oval office and her husband is just lost. He (Fred MacMurray) gets the canopied bedroom and the office full of pictures of former first ladies and nobody knows how to address him. First man doesn't have a nice ring to it, does it? I'm interested to see how this is handled when it really happens.

A comedy, the movie has many LOL moments as the ""first man"" locks himself out of the living quarters in his pajamas, ends up in a bit of a brawl in a strip club, and just has one unfortunate event after another. My favorite scene is when he attempts to give a tour of the White House, on camera, after having a few too many....errr..pills and drinks to calm his nerves. Priceless! Hilarious!

Meanwhile, the president's children are using their new status to get away with things, like the little boy threatening everyone at school and then using his Secret Service agents to protect him.

I laughed quite a few times, but the best part of the movie was watching a lady president, a no-nonsense woman, handle all the men who came her way, from a belligerent and threatening senator, to a somewhat amorous dictator. And of course, I loved the clothes. I love the sixties' clothes. And the actress (Polly Bergen) just did a superb job. She carried herself with grace and looked and acted the part superbly.

I enjoyed this movie, laughed often, got a kick out of it, but the ending...everything just came crashing down into a HUGE disappointment for me. I'm not going to give it away, but it's awful. Worst ending they could have come up with. What a way to disappoint and let down 40 million women. You'd think she'd have been more careful...

If you don't mind a crappy ending, the movie is worth the time just for the laughs and the woman president theme. Feminists will find themselves happy until the last five minutes. I'd also like to note that the picture was amazingly good. I've watched some not-so-great quality classic flicks and had some trouble with the picture, not so this time.",1406678400,4,2176,4.566666666666666
461795,3,6302390362,"There's good and bad in this picture, we get an intimate view of what is like to be a president, the separate bedrooms for the husband and wife, the secret service. We also see how people try to influence the president, the horse trading, even a woman that tries to seduce the first man to get her company publicity. And I love the stories of how the two children, a teenage daughter and a young son, get in trouble. The boy becomes a bully because the secret service protects him and the girl and and a boy named Sneaker proceed to drive like crazy. HOWEVER, the ending was absolutely ridiculous (spoiler alert), she gets pregnant, faints, and resigns her job because the doctors tell her it's what she has to do to save her baby. Really? I realize women get maternity leave, but it's not like she's working a hard job like lumberjack or fishermen, she's the president for crying out loud, it's a desk job. How hard can it be? These people have assistants that do everything for them, they don't even have to write their own speeches if they don't want to. Frankly, the ending suggests that we can't have a woman president because God forbid she gets pregnant, she'll be useless.",1404345600,5,1180,4.518691588785047

fair and believable portrait of a woman, or anybody for

job with professional grace and commitment.
