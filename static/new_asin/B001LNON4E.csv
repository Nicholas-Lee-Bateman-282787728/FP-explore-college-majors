8319148,3,B001LNON4E,"The atmosphere is quite sinister and very threatening. Judy Geeson (of TO SIR, WITH LOVE fame) does well in her role as the pretty blonde heroine, and Aurora Batista and Esperanza Roy are indeed the most menacing inn-keepers since Mr. Norman Bates. Though obviously inspired by PSYCHO, this truly deranged Spanish shocker features several gruesome sequences which makes the film way ahead of its time. In fact, the film's only real drawback is the poor dubbing that makes it resemble one of those cheesy Euro-Hercules flicks.

The film does indeed have that European quality from the 60's or 70's films.",1385942400,,603,5.03
