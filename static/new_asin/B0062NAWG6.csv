It will still not play...i was embarrassed after it was returned to me when it was given as a gift because of the condition.",1447545600,,293,4.157894736842105

8491248,1,B0062NAWG6,"Received Disc, was damaged. Didn't want to go through the drama of going to post office to return DVD, am handy capped so going through all of that is not worth the trouble. My local library has several copies of this disc, all of theirs was defective like mine!",1354060800,2,262,4.36734693877551
8491249,2,B0062NAWG6,"The DVD quality was poor. It kept freezing and that frustrates me. The substance of this 45-minute documentary was not filling. They interviewed mostly nameless individuals whose credentials were not revealed. Only three people were revealed by name because they gave musical tributes, which sucked. Amy Winehouse's memory was not benefitted by this documentary. Get it from the library if you insist upon watching it.",1352764800,2,418,5.446153846153846
