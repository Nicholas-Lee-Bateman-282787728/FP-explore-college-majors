This film has been distributed as ""Vengeance"" in English speaking countries, likely because that is the main theme of the story, and also the main music soundtrack. This film was directed by Italian director Antonio Margheriti in 1968, yes, same director of some zombie and exploitation films. The story is straight simple. Joko, played by Richard Harrison, joined a small gang to steal some gold. The robbery was led by Mendoza (played by Claudio Camaso), a sort of psycho character that planned the whole thing. Things went wrong as they were caught and as result, Joko's best friend is ripped apart by horses tied to his arms and legs (not shown though). One by one, he tracks them down and kills them. The story has a few other details and twists that contribute to keep the viewer entertained. The acting is fine. Indeed, Harrison is above Giuliano Gemma but below Gianni Garko when it comes to the typical hero of Spaghetti westerns. Overall, a slightly above average film in its kind (worth 3 or 3,5 stars when you rate Leone's films as first rate).

Technically, the DVD transfer by Nacadih Video is very good. The transfer comes in nice widescreen format. The film runs for 94 minutes. The audio is in Spanish or Italian only. No subtitles are provided. Please, note this is a PAL, region 2 DVD.",1425168000,,1335,4.700854700854701
