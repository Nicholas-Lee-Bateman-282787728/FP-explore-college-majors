513654,5,6302800447,I got this DVD in less time than i expected and it was exactly as advertised. In good condition--no worries.,1230249600,,108,4.45
513655,5,6302800447,"This film has so many positive attributes that I can recommend it without hesitation.
First, the photography is exceptional. Scenes encompass the action as well as the land. Nothing seems hurried or extraneous.
Second, the plot is well executed. The story is compelling-- the saga of embracing what is difficult and different. Coming to terms with a culture vastly different and challenging on many levels.
Third, and lastly, the careful honesty that comes through in portraying an indiginous people that are clearly a conundrum for the main characters. How they manage relationship between each other and the people they come to know.
I found this film to be simply wonderful.",1205193600,3,677,5.163636363636364
513656,4,6302800447,"First and foremost, ""We of the Never Never"" must be counted as a visually beautiful film, a triumph of cinematography which reveals the Australian outback in all its splendor.  Gary Hansen won a well deserved award for the cinematography.

The story (adapted from a true account by ""Mrs. Aeneas Gunn"") follows an Australian pioneer bride with a budding feminist sensibility as she learns to live in the Aussie wilderness, at the cattle station run by her new husband.

Jeannie Gunn (played by Angela Punch McGregor) is a woman of determination.  She refuses to accept the ""code of stoic suffering"" embraced by the cattle ranchers, nor will she abide their condescension toward the Aboriginal people, who are treated as slaves.

Beyond the highlighted social issues, ""We of the Never Never"" is a film that becomes powerful in its unsentimental portrayal of death.  Death treats the lowly and the privileged equally, and the death scenes in this movie are utterly, tragically believable.  The culminating scene between Jeannie and her husband is very touching.  Arthur Dignam, who plays the husband, gives a nuanced performance, the best performance in the film.

As a bonus, there is a beguiling musical score by Peter Best, which features strings, cor anglais, and digeridoo.

CAUTIONARY NOTE:  Heavy Australian accents should have dictated that this dvd come equipped with subtitles.  It does not, and for that omission I deduct one star.",1179100800,10,1439,5.155172413793103
513657,5,6302800447,This is one of the most remarkable films ever made.  The casting - the story - the cinematography - an all round excellent film.  The soundtrack adds a lot to the emotion and excitement of the story line.  I would recommend this film to anyone.  It has depth of meaning.  A very worthwhile film.  I am so grateful that is is now available in Region 1.  It has been a long time coming and well worth the wait.  Buy it sight unseen and you will never regret it.,1173916800,4,459,4.136363636363637
513658,5,6302800447,"We of the Never Never was a real surprise: sounding like one of a thousand other woman-making-her-way-on-the-frontier movies, albeit set in the Australian outback, it actually turns out to be a terrific piece of old-style epic filmmaking on a grand scale. The unexpected casting pays dividends: Angela Punch McGregor conveys just the right strength of character for someone simultaneously trying to fit in where she's not wanted and who is still open to what those around her have to offer, white or Aborigine, while Arthur Dignam's very unlikeliness as a cattle station manager works in his favor. Gary Hansen's scope photography is truly breathtaking, and director Igor Auzin's mastery of the frame without losing sight of his characters is so impressive that you wonder why he only made one more feature. The 2.35:1 ratio is not just window dressing either: not only does it stress both the vastness and hard beauty of the place, but it also serves to highlight the marginalization of the various characters by class, gender or race. Pretty terrific.

The Australian DVD is pretty terrific too, boasting a fine 2.35:1 transfer, a good retrospective documentary 'Back to the Never Never,' 40's documentary 'Walkabout,' stills gallery, isolated score and original theatrical trailer. A winner all the way.",1145750400,4,1306,5.219047619047619
513659,4,6302800447,"This is based on a memoir by the pioneer Australian woman ,Aeneas Gunn about her years on  a cattle station in the Australian outback around the turn of the last century and is  beautiful looking movie .Strikingly shot and with a haunting score by Peter Best it is also wonderfully well acted by a non -stellar cast of Australian performers .

It is an absorbing study of life on the frontier which while slow moving is involving throughout not least for its distinctly Australian feel

It is a movie I unreservedly recommend for  its insights into a distant world remote in both place and time",1104451200,33,594,4.619047619047619
513660,4,6302800447,"I saw this film many years ago and it was unforgettable. I re-watched it recently and I was not disappointed. One of the most realistic views of Australian history and the impact of the white settlers on the Aboriginal culture.
What's wonderful is that there is no real ""villain"" here -- the characters are subtle (something American filmmakers should learn) and interesting. The ending is a bit flat but that may be merely a typical American need for a big finale. Don't let it stop you from watching this film.
But whatever you do -- DO NOT READ THE BLURB ON THE BACK! It gives away the entire story (including the ending).",1027900800,29,625,4.589285714285714
513661,5,6302800447,"Back in the 70's, the Australian Government generously funded the arts and the film industry, and this film is one of the greats from that period -considered to be the ""golden age"" of australian filmaking.
If you are interested in knowing more about australian history, and the  tragic consequences of white settlement for the aboriginal people, this is  a good film to start with.
The moral complexities of the tragedy are  reminicent of the recent film ""dead heart"".  I would also  recommend the film ""walkabout"".
 There is something about the  way the lead aboriginal character holds a certain kind of quiet dignity  that is heartbreaking to watch.  I do not agree with leonard maltin that  this film fails to pack a dramatic punch. This is a beautiful and emotional  film, and i would recommend it as part of any film studies course that is  dealing with the australian genre.",963273600,25,880,4.832214765100671
7831429,5,6302800447,The movie was educational .  It is humbling to see what some pioneer women did.,1519689600,,79,4.266666666666667
7831430,1,6302800447,"I have no idea what this movie is about since, after 2 try outs, I am still unable to watch it even though both of the copies I got are supposedly watchable in all zones...not working on my Blue Ray DVD...a real bummer!!!",1464998400,,221,4.162790697674419

7831432,5,6302800447,"If you liked ""Out of Africa,"" you'll like ""We of the Never Never"" about the first western woman to live in the outback of Australia. Beautiful cinematography and a lovely film score.",1455321600,,182,4.71875
7831433,5,6302800447,This is a classic and should be viewed by anyone interested in Australian history!,1438732800,,82,4.928571428571429
7831434,1,6302800447,"WARNING: This Blu-ray will not play. This was my second attempt to purchase a disc on ""Never Never"" that worked. A scene menu appears, but the film will not play. From Canada, it costs more to return the item to Amazon than it costs to buy it. What they reimburse does not cover the costs. I am deeply disappointed, as this is one of the world's great films, and to have it on Blu-ray would be great. But, once again, Amazon has let me down selling international films on discs that do not play. I had this experience previously with Polish and English films marketed to me by Amazon in the last year. The description in the advertisement suggests there will be no problem playing the disc, and then it simply doesn't work. Our Blu-ray machine is brand new, and has no other difficulties playing discs. These experiences will definitely influence my future purchasing from Amazon. They should not be marketing films that will not play on North American Blu-ray or DVD machines without making that abundantly clear!",1432944000,,1014,4.702247191011236
7831435,5,6302800447,Rather slow moving as was the novel I studied at uni. But as Maltin says the movie is worth watching for the color and scenery alone. The script is true to the novel and should be applauded for that,1367539200,,198,4.102564102564102
7831436,5,6302800447,"Saw this movie years ago and thrilled it is on DVD..wonderful true story of just what a culture shock
A Victorian bride experienced slogging across flooded terrain to arrive at what could only be described as a God forsaken station deep in the outback. She embraces the Aboriginal women and adopts a young girl who goes walkabout. Through all this she finds great happiness with her husband and changes the attitudes of the men of the station who at best have difficulty with social skills. The Aboriginal culture is very dreamlike and adapted to the harsh country. This shy woman rises to great strengths and leads the station with her quiet gentle kindness. Way ahead of her time she was a force to be reckoned with!",1363824000,,718,4.7063492063492065
7831437,4,6302800447,"A great movie. shows just what these people went through back in the early days in the Australian Outback. It also shows the true relationship with the Australian Aboriginal back in those early days.
Being from that part of Australia i can relate to the scenery. Rugged, hostile yet wonderful.
The only problem would be that if you are not Australian, you might find it hard to understand the Aussie Lingo(language) that is spoken by the Stockmen,(Cowboys) or in some cases they use the word, Ringers in place of Stockmen.
Regardless, it is a wonderful movie.",1263168000,,559,4.833333333333333
7831438,5,6302800447,So glad I found this movie. i saw it when it first came out and couldn't find it again until I checked this web site.  It's a little hard to understand because of the thick aussie accents but very well done and beautiful scenery.,1236902400,,229,4.204545454545454
