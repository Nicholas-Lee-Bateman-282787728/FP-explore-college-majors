2154479,5,B00030600Q,By far one of my most favorite Firm cardio workouts. I have over 20 in my rotation and this one is great. Challenging and a fun.,1104278400,,128,3.9615384615384617
2154480,2,B00030600Q,"This video uses a modified step called the FIRM box.  You probably won't be able to find this in a regular athletic store, and it costs twice the price of a regular step.  Unless you already own this step, this is not the video for you.",1104019200,2,236,4.108695652173913
2154481,1,B00030600Q,Buy the firm and you will be sent a large number of unordered videos along with unordered vitamins. BEWARE.,1102809600,,107,4.684210526315789
2154482,5,B00030600Q,Many of the Firm Cardio work outs are 55 to 60min. long however This one is just 30 mintues. There is a mix of three different workout here. so you will not being doing just step for an hour. This is a Great addition to any Workout schedule.,1102636800,,241,4.041666666666667
2154483,5,B00030600Q,"Fast & Firm Series Express Cardio is also sold as Express Cardio as part of the Body Sculpting System 3 set.  The only difference between this workout and the BSS3 Express Cardio is the cover design.  This workout calls for the Firm Box (you'll use it on the incline quite a bit) and light dumbbells--3 pounds or less.  You could modify and use a regular step or the Fanny Lifter without much problem, but I really enjoy the incline Box for this and other BSS3 workouts.

This is a fun, intense 30 minute pure cardio workout.  The choreography is varied and interesting without being overwhelming and Stephanie never asks you to do anything on the box that feels dangerous.  Her cuing is excellent--as much as I like Fat Blasting Cardio with Lisa Kay (another 30 minute BSS3 cardio workout) I think that Stephanie does a superior job with cuing and flow in this workout.  Stephanie also improves on her performances in previous Firm workouts--unlike older workouts like Super Body Sculpt, she speaks with good intonation and doesn't slip into a monotone.  She stays upbeat and encouraging throughout the workout, which makes it more fun for the user.

I own almost all of BSS1, all of BSS2, and most of BSS3--of all of those Firms, this video easily makes my top three favorites of all time.  It's a great 30 minute workout!",1102464000,62,1324,4.692640692640692
2154484,5,B00030600Q,"This workout has a great mixture of step, incline box and tall box work. In 30 minutes, I felt I got a great workout. I found the cueing easy to follow and the moves fun. I would recommend this for people who are used to doing step aerobic type exercise though. Not for beginners!",1100908800,5,280,4.203703703703703
2154485,5,B00030600Q,"I love this workout! Stephanie Huckabee leads you on a 30 minute cardio workout that will get your muscles burning. The time flew by I was having so much fun. There is a lot of variety; it combines traditional step aerobics with low-impact floor aerobics and strength moves. Some parts of the step aerobics were hard to follow at first, but with practice, you will get the moves down.

In order to use this DVD, you need to either have the Firm Box or a step which can be set to 6"", 14"" and an incline. They also suggest the use of some light hand weights (I used 3 pounders).

This is an intermediate to advanced level workout that I will return to often.",1100563200,11,656,4.282258064516129
2154486,5,B00030600Q,"I received this DVD as a gift from my husband who was tired of hearing me complain about not having time to exercise with an 18 month old running around. I am so happy to have this workout. Even busy moms can find 30 minutes and this workout makes that 30 minutes worth it! I have been a ""FIRM Believer"" for many years and this workout doesn't disappoint. It's to the point cardio and while i agree the cues could be a little better, I just ran through the more confusing parts 4 or 5 times slowly after my workout and it didn't take me long to get the hang of it. It's really helpful to have prior knowledge of the FIRM terminology from older workouts(i.e. Samba, Mambo, ChaCha, Step/Glut, Press Step, etc) as you will catch on more quickly. I don't have the Firm Box with Incline, but I have modified a few things to make it work with the Fanny Lifter. I highly recommend Express Cardio!!",1231891200,,890,4.303571428571429
2154487,5,B00030600Q,"I have a ton of Firm videos, and I use this one when I want a cardio workout that is quick but keeps my heart rate up. Stephanie is a good leader, as always.",1218499200,,157,3.6470588235294117
2154488,3,B00030600Q,"This workout has upbeat music with challenging moves. However, Stephanie's cueing is very poor in this one. Some of the moves are complicated, but that doesnt excuse anything. Many of the Firm's cardio moves are complicated, but many other instructors do much better job cueing those moves. I'd recomment this workout, but be weary of the tall box climb and incline step aerobics- the sets in which her signaling is at its lowest. On the bright side, don't be afraid to try Stephanie's other workouts, such as Jiggle Free Arms or Ultimate Calorie Blaster- she's much much better in both of them, and the workouts will kick your butt!",1211932800,,633,4.81651376146789
2154489,5,B00030600Q,This is a great 30 minute workout!  I am SO happy with this product; it takes up so little of your day and still gives you a great cardio workout.,1201392000,,146,3.8666666666666667
2154490,5,B00030600Q,"This is a really fun and quick workout from The Firm.  I know that it is older but it's very effective and you get a great workout in a short period of time -- really important if you have small children!  The only thing I do not like is that the footwork is difficult to get.  I am a trained dancer and pick moves up very easily and this video has been difficult for me to get.  You really do have to watch it several times to be able to do the workout without a mistake.  Some videos have much better cueing -- but even with this extra challenge, I always do this video again and again because it is so much fun -- the music is great!  I would recommend it for the intermediate to advanced group -- and do not get discouraged if you have done it many times and still have trouble with the moves!",1200960000,,797,4.012658227848101
2154491,1,B00030600Q,"I have been working out to the Firm for years, and it's usually easy for me to learn steps on new DVDs.  However, this DVD has the most ridiculous step portion in the beginning, to the point where I still can't follow it AT ALL after a few workouts.  This is my least favorite BY FAR of all of the Firm workouts I've done.  Also, if you already own Ultimate Calorie Blaster of the Transfirmer series, don't even bother buying this DVD.  It is practically the same workout in a different order.  I am giving up on this DVD.  Maybe someone at Goodwill will want to break their ankle.",1196985600,2,581,4.284403669724771
2154492,5,B00030600Q,"Stephanie builds really great workouts that flow nicely, are fun and have excellent cueing.  I do this workout a couple times a week in the morning and generally have a most excellent day at work afterwards.  I own..geez..a BUNCH of firm videos -my top 5 during-the-week workouts are Express Cardio, Jiggle free arms, abs, buns..which I like to alternate with express cardio for morning workouts.. and Ultimate Calorie blaster with Stephanie. That one I save for after work because it's 45 minutes long and really kicks my *ss!  On the weekends, aside from getting outdoors, I like to do Ripped 1000 with Jari Love and the Firm Aerobic body shaping which is almost an hour and makes me sweat..however, Allie's workouts just don't flow as nicely as Stephanie's.  THe transitions are often awkward, especially in the warm-up.  Still recommended.  do even just 5 half-hour firm workouts a week and your rear will shape up into a nice firm bubble butt.  Eat lots of avocados in conjunction with these workouts and I swear, the cellulite just disappears!",1182211200,,1049,4.926136363636363
2154493,5,B00030600Q,"Strenuous, vigorous, half-hour workout; more sweat than some lasting twice as long.  The ""turn"" steps are a little confusing, but don't worry about it.  Just keep going and you'll come out fine.",1177632000,,194,5.03125
2154494,5,B00030600Q,"I love this workout.  The moves are fun and the time flies.  I saw other reviewers mention that the steps are difficult to follow.  If you are familiar with the moves for Total Muscle Shaping (same instructor) and Complete Body Sculpting and like those workouts, you will love this video.  The moves are similar, and the set and instructors are the same.

I must admit that the first aerobic segment has some footwork that took a while to master.  I did my best and kept moving (sometimes kind-of flailed around at first).  If I did something else instead of this side-step-over foot tap move, I doubt it made a difference.

[ Also: this workout uses 3 lb dumbbells, so it is perfect to use in-between heavier-weight workout routines]",1176336000,,734,4.6796875
2154495,3,B00030600Q,"I agree with the other reviewers that the choreography is somewhat challenging; however, it is not so challenging to prohibit purchasing this quick workout.  It appears that when the Firm first released an incline type step, they decided to train using a sideview.  This makes it very difficult to follow as you have to turn your head to the side to watch the television (in order to try to synch up with the performance), and thus, cannot watch the step at the same time.  Trying to do it facing the television could be done, but it then, makes it hard to follow.  The Firm changed this with the DVDs issued with the TransFirmer.  That being said, it is a nice, short workout that does get some increase in heartrate.",1169251200,6,718,4.534883720930233
2154496,1,B00030600Q,"As others have mentioned, the FIRM workouts are generally fabulous, but this has the weakest instructor of any of the many FIRM workouts I've done. Another reviewer mentioned that some of the sequences are impossible for someone ""with no dance background""; I have an extensive dance background and found the routines virtually impossible to learn, especially at the pace at which this instructor leads the class. She offers no actual instruction on how to do the moves; rather, she leads the class like a square dance caller, yelling out names of moves that someone would only know if they are experienced at step aerobics. In addition, the camera work often means you're not seeing the instructor's moves completely or from an angle where you can actually figure out the footwork, even if you slow the DVD down. There are much better FIRM workouts out there.",1169078400,5,859,4.931034482758621
2154497,5,B00030600Q,"This wokout is not an easy one, but it will have you sweating in the first 10 minutes. There are a lot of step combinations. I think after about 4 times the combinations will be doable.",1168905600,2,185,4.166666666666667
2154498,2,B00030600Q,"I love the Firm. I hate this DVD.  Not only did I nearly break my ankle about 5 times and fell off the thing so many times I lost count, there are NO ""practice steps"".  They just start spinning from front to back over and over without telling you what they're doing.  I am not hand and foot coordinated.  I have trouble making my arms and my feet do different things at the same time (I know that sounds stupid, but I have not a single dance bone in my body!! lol).  I say dance because the movements are fast, spinning (literally) and akward (sp?).  I just hate it.  Exercise is supposed to release happy endorphins, not make you feel hopeless or angry!

I'll stick to the other Firm workouts that I can modify.  This one's going to a friend much more coordinated than I!",1159056000,8,772,4.268965517241379
2154499,4,B00030600Q,"While this routine does provide a good cardio workout in a relatively short period of time, I think the Step workout at the beginning of the tape is ridiculously intricate and advanced footwork.  I'm a Firm Addict from the 80's and have nearly all their DVD/Videos.  I resumed regular workouts 2-1/2 years ago after a period of laziness.  I've put this DVD in numerous times, gotten frustrated to the point of anger and stopped it to put in another.  I mean, come ON, while I think a little challenge initially keeps the routines from getting dull and boring, the first step routine is entirely too complicated and constantly changing, especially with the pace being so fast.  After all, it IS Express Cardio.  I've mastered countless other routines with fairly trickly footwork, such as Cardio Sculpt Blaster, so while I won't claim to pick routines up fast, I am willing to put in the time to work through the learning curve.  Today I was determined and it took me 30 minutes to finally learn a 4 minute step segment.  I had to keep playing and replaying the section before I could follow.

I love The Firm, but they seemed to get carried away for a period of time with the choreography and I think this is their most extreme in terms of difficulty in learning.

I'm writing this in the hopes of preventing someone who is trying The Firm for the first time with Express Cardio from getting turned off, thinking all Firm exercise routines are this tricky.  The Firm is a wonderful exercise system that I heartily recommend, but start with another one before attempting this one unless you enjoy a challenge.

I'd have given this routine a 5 star otherwise.",1158451200,12,1657,4.6563573883161515
2154500,5,B00030600Q,"I wanted to start exercising after being sedentary for a long time. I bought this video hoping it would give me a good work out in 30 minutes. I was not disappointed. The first time I tried it, it was so challenging I thought I would never get through it. I stuck with it and it is now my major work out video. I use it 3 times per week. They promise results in 10 workouts and I am so pleased with the results that I went out and bought 3 more firm videos. I am hooked. I can't wait for my workout in the evenings.",1157068800,3,515,3.8679245283018866
2154501,5,B00030600Q,I love love love this video when I'm in a time crunch.  Great cardio delivered in 30 minutes - fun music and a great stretch at the end.  Highly recommended!,1150761600,,157,4.2
2154502,3,B00030600Q,I felt that Stephanie did not cue the moves very well.  She was hard to follow and some of the moves were difficult to get the hang of!  That said-I am new to The Firm workouts and hopefully will get more comfortable with the workouts.  I do feel that my heart rate was increased and the 30 minutes did seem to go by pretty fast.,1149033600,,329,4.030769230769231
2154503,2,B00030600Q,I love The Firm series but this dvd was such a huge disapointment the film quality was so poor and the sound was terrible!! Also she does all of the exercises facing the other way so it's hard to follow her.,1145404800,2,207,4.073170731707317
2154504,5,B00030600Q,"We all know the value of long and hard workouts, but some days that's just not an option.  Express Cardio fits the bill perfectly.  It gets in 30 minutes of high intensity cardio that is fun.  I love Stephanie as an instructor and find her moves very fun.  I would highly recommend this DVD to any other Firm junkie out there!",1141948800,2,326,4.295081967213115
2154505,2,B00030600Q,"I am a Firm believer but I find this DVD is just awful.  I should've listened to another review that said that this was good if someone is a choreographer.  There are so many changes and moves that I dropped the leader & was doing my own thing half way through the workout.  This DVD doesn't show Libby very often so beginners (or those attmepting to catch onto the moves) are lost as well.  Everytime she said, ""new move coming up"" I just CRINGED.  Good for advanced Firm users, but not for beginners or intermediates.  My opinion of course.  Also, I didn't have the slanted box, but even without it I was sweating.  I MUCH more prefer Cardio Sculpt Blaster, and would not give this DVD to a friend.  It's going to the thrift shop at my earliest convenience.",1141344000,4,759,4.402877697841727
2154506,1,B00030600Q,"I loved the ""old"" Firm videos, but this one makes me change my mind about ever wanting to try the new ones.  The cuing is inadequate, the moves are too complicated, the sequences too quickly over to do any good, and the production values sloppy.  No wonder Anna Benson broke off from this company -- I will stick with the old Firm releases!",1139961600,2,340,4.380952380952381
2154507,5,B00030600Q,"I love this workout. It's just over 30 minutes, so I have no problem squeezing the workout into my busy day. You get such a great workout in a short amount of time. You get results you can feel & see.

I don't feel I am that coordinated, so some of the steps seemed a bit tricky at first. After a couple of times though, I was a pro and had the steps down no problem. This workout is fun and the time just flies by when I use it.

You will need The Firm Box (or another box that inclines) and light weights to maximize your results.",1139875200,4,532,3.9166666666666665
2154508,5,B00030600Q,"The Firm is a prime example of why some people succeed with weight loss and body transformation and why others do not. The extremely negative reviewer below that is basically bashing Firmers everywhere is enough to shy anyone away from buying these workouts. But, fear not people! You CANNOT buy any workout DVD without first reading the information. Whether you bought the tape online or at the store, you must READ, READ, READ! Educate yourself! Don't expect to buy a workout and not have to use some type of equipment. Whether it be weights or bands or the FIRM BOX! Said reviewer simply did not read! Also...the main attraction for many to The Firm is the choreography. Sure, it is a bit difficult to learn if you aren't familiar with the terminology (I wasn't familiar with it at all), but if you just jump right in and do the workouts, you will pick up quickly! Don't waste your time watching the videos thinking it will teach you something. You must do them...and then gradually over the first few days you will pick it up. Who cares about wasting a week learning the moves? Because you will see much greater results with The Firm over a 3-month period than you will with any other workouts. So...waste your time doing things that don't work? Or spend a week learning that ""Firmese"" and steps and get awesome results? You will be really happy when you do get the moves down too, because you will never get bored with The Firm. No matter how many times you do each video. As for this one, this is one of the more difficult ones to pick up, but just TRY IT. Do it until you get it and YOU WILL get it. YOU CAN DO IT! Ignore the negativity and take some positive advice for a change. Order your Firm Box and get stepping! It isn't cheap, but WHAT IS????",1139702400,15,1757,4.425925925925926
2154509,5,B00030600Q,"First off, I would like to say that this is a fun/challenging video. The music is fantastic and the moves never get boring. I've had this tape for 6 months and I'm still not bored! I haven't even touched my windsor pilates DVD since getting this.
As someone who only has one other Firm tape, I have to say that It took me a few viewings to get the footwork down. I think this is because I didn't recognize her ""cues""- I had no idea what she was talking about. It's like some secret code, its not like she says step here and punch there. These ""moves"" have names! Like ""Samba""-that one is easy to figure out after watching her but some are more complex. Don't worry though, this is only during the first 5 minutes of the routine!
After you get through that, you will find this video fun! Stephanies energy is incredible. It keeps me motivated! Her muscle definition is definately encouraging.
This tape is not boring! I couldn't make it all the way through the first time. Now, I have the energy to do it twice!
Let me repeat, this video is NOT boring! It keeps you on your toes and grooving to the awesome music!! LOVE it.
I could never go back to pilates...too boring for me now!",1135900800,6,1180,4.31981981981982
2154510,4,B00030600Q,"Some might argue that this isn't true cardio because one segment incorporates slow-paced weight training, but what else would you expect from The Firm? It does keep my heart rate up there. As others posted here before you can probably use a regular step with this video. I'll admit some of the moves (especially if you're not familiar with The Firm) are hard to follow at first and I still get tripped up occasionally. It's got a huge variety of moves and some good music tracks to keep me going and sticking with it. I also like that it's only 30 minutes since cardio is not my favorite type of exercise.",1135814400,4,605,4.45945945945946

Not really for beginners.  gets my heart rate up.  it took me a few times doing it to get all the moves down, but once i did it was great.  this is a fun workout and i love doing step on an incline.  Targets the rear so much better.  you can also intensify the workouts by stepping higher on the incline.  great workout when you have only 30 minutes.

It really packs a punch in little time. The routine is innovative and interesting, it flows well and goes great with the music. The variety is good too, you use the box in incline position for a few segments, in the 14 inch position for one leg press segment and there are some cardio segments that you don't use the box at all. The workout can be easily modified and is doable without using the incline at all for those who don't like working on it. Light dumbells are used (3 lbs max) but you could forego the dumbells if you prefer and still get a solid workout.

2154515,2,B00030600Q,"There are building blocks to any good workout that lead to the final routine.  Express Cardio skips the building part - goes straight to the routine and leaves most beginners and a fair amount of advanced excercisers behind.  There is nothing that is terribly wrong with the step routines or this workout but it left something to be desired in the instructing department.  If fact, there wasn't any.  She told you to do it and left you to fend for yourself.  Sure, it wasn't boring - just extremely frustrating.  I've been with the Firm since Volume 1 came out - and in my experience anything the Firm makes that says its cardio is usually not their best.  They excel in other areas and if you are going to use the Firm - you should expect to use props.  They have always required something - but I believe now they are going gadget crazy.  You don't need their box.  You can find ways around any of their gadget requirements.  A Reebok step can duplicate everything that box does except go to 14"" - and if you already have their wooden step up box from way way back or their recent ""fanny lifter"" - then you have that too.  Any other stool of that height is acceptable.  If I were you, I wouldn't buy this workout - there are much better cardio workouts out there.",1105920000,11,1265,4.377682403433476
8035557,2,B00030600Q,"I wouldn't recommend this if you are just starting with ""The Firm"" workouts. I own many Firm workouts and this one is not my favorite. While it does give you a good workout, the instructor is very hard to follow. She introduces new moves at full speed. I had to replay the first series several times, and finally gave up and just improvised. I was able to follow her after watching several times, but when I put this back in my rotation after several months, I was lost again.",1508630400,,476,4.359550561797753

Within 15 minutes I had it popped back OUT and thrown in the garbage. What a waste of my time. The moves are ridiculous and as another reviewer mentioned, the instructor calls the moves out like square dancing.  You are basically supposed to know what to do next. It's very fast paced and I found myself marching in place WAY too many times trying to figure out what the heck she was doing.

8035561,4,B00030600Q,"I have been doing The Firm since the mid 1980's. I think I own every ""Classic"" Firm tape there is. I just hope my VCR lives forever, because the old ones really are the best. They kick my butt and get me in shape faster and don't require the space and bells and whistles the newer ones do.

But I purchased some of the new Firm DVD's to see if they were as good as the old. They aren't, but I like this tape. It grew on me.

Pros:
Short
If I don't feel like a long workout, or am pressed for time, this really is short and sweet. It's about 30 min of cardio and they get right into it. The DVD starts and you get right into aerobics. There is a warm up, but they keep it short. If you need to work out, get your heart going and get it done and over with, this is good for that.

Light Weights
I still do the old Firms which are heavy on weight work, which to me is the best for results. But on those days my muscles need the break (you should be resting your muscles at least 24 hours after heavy lifting) this is good for that. It's mainly cardio, with just 3 lbs weights which you can skip and still get a workout. So this is good for your alternate days.

Updated Music
let's be honest, some of those old tapes have really cheesy music. I love the electronic and hip hop music which get's you going.

Cons:
The choreography! Ack.
Listen, I'm no slouch and can keep time, but these moves have even me fumbling and stumbling. I just can't get it together and find myself just doing something else until they are done with the complicated moves. I really do hope they re-think this new direction, it's frustrating and at times I've tripped myself up.

Space
The older tapes you could do on a postage stamp. Well, not really, but you get the idea. You only needed a space space in your room in order to workout. In this one, I have to make sure I've really cleared the space.

The Transfirmer. I don't have one. I'm not getting one either. So when they are doing The Transfirmer moves, I'm just using my small step box that I have had for 20 years.",1357344000,2,2066,4.11166253101737
8035562,4,B00030600Q,"I find myself reaching for this DVD most often when I want a fast, efficient cardio workout.  Yes the first segment is complicated - needlesly, in my opinion.  But hang in there, you will get it and the incline segments are worth it.  I have the old ""death-box"" and it's half broken, but it still inclines, and those are the sweet-spot segments for me.  The floor portions are good, but not great (not really low-impact, but the alternative moves are lack-luster) and the high step (which I do on low-step - again, that broken box) is short but effective.  Somehow, even with all the cons, I really like this workout and I finish in about a half hour revved up and dripping sweat.",1313452800,,680,4.495934959349594
8035563,1,B00030600Q,"There is absolutely no explanation of any moves, so when the instructor gives a cue it has no meaning. By the time you figure out what you should be doing they've gone onto something else. I tried to just watch the DVD, and I had trouble following the moves just watching it. Apparently the ""express"" part of this DVD shoots right past all the usefull  information. Complete waste of money.",1295136000,,390,4.571428571428571
8035564,5,B00030600Q,"If you're short on time and want and effective work this is it! I really enjoy this DVD and Stephanie Huckabee is awesome too. I get a great workout in a short time with this DVD. I like many of the Firm workouts however the ones with Stephanie are usually my favorite. She has broke out on her own and now has a DVD series called ""Power Fit"" you can find it right her at Amazon. The Power Fit Harmony is in my opinion a female version of P90X however, shorter but does use the muscle confusion process of developing your new body. I would certainly suggest this DVD and any others with Stephanie Huckabee. Her cuing is perfect and she actually helps you enjoy the workout. I hope this helps in your decision to buy this DVD and other workouts with Stephanie Huckabee.",1290816000,2,768,4.340277777777778
8035565,1,B00030600Q,"I'm a huge fan of The Firm anything, even with challenging choreography.  This particular one made me almost turn it off before it got started.  When the instructor introduced the other girls, two of them look so unhealthy that I didn't even want my daughter (7) who normally ""dances"" with us to see them.  I'm all for looking trim, fit and healthy, but you could see these girls' bones.  Not a good example for me to aspire to, nor my sweet daughters. I ended up turning it off before it was over.",1274140800,,498,4.380434782608695
8035566,5,B00030600Q,"this is one of my favorite firm workouts!  Stephanie is amazingly fun and on beat.  The workout moves and changes enough so that even after the 100th time of doing it, it is fun! I feel it works everything but my abs in a quick intensive way.  I own 20+ firm workouts and this is one of my favorites.",1249257600,,300,4.0508474576271185
