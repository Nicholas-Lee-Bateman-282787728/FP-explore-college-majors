8307380,5,B001GXMUB2,"My local library offered this dvd along with the book. It was SO helpful! I found the book easier to take in (there is so much information) and retain after watching the dvd. I was hoping I could buy a copy to watch repeatedly but not at this price. I will check it out again and recommend it to everyone remotely interested in the subject. FYI, there are three lectures. Part 1, 1 hr 58 min, Part 2, 1hr 34 min, Part 3, 1hr 54min. Part 1 covers Dr. Price and his research and findings. Part 2 is a practical summary for application plus a warning aginst certain soy products. Part 3 is a elequent defense of raw milk and more about how to incorporate traditional foods into our modern diets.",1447718400,2,692,4.290076335877862

8307384,5,B001GXMUB2,"I always knew that the key to health was to learn how people lived and ate in the past, but I had no idea as to how to find that vital information that would stop me being fed one expensive and body destroying lie after another (all so that others would make more money from my suffering).  So much information has been deliberately removed from common knowledge and has not been passed on from mother to daughters due to mothers abandoning their responsibility to teach the next generation the wisdom of the ages.  I have no doubt about the truths taught by Sally, as when I think back, I remember some of the old traditions my mother told me about- one of which was that ALL babies and children were given a daily dose of Cod liver oil in England as standard practice.  Sally is also right when she says that the diet encouraged by the Governments and ""experts"" is designed specifically for the purposes of ""population reduction"" and ""money making"".  I was a total vegetarian for many years and then I went into raw foods.  I became very skinny and never felt or looked healthy.  I also was never really satisfied after a meal.  I miscarried twice and my ""raw food"" baby ended up with crowded and rotten teeth at the age of 3 1/2 years.  When I went back to adding meat and raw milk into my family's diet, I could not believe how we all craved meat and fat so very much.  I have a long way to go but although I am not completely fit and healthy, I feel that I am stronger in mind, body and spirit.  Please do yourself a favour and trust the old ways.  Modern ways have had time now to be tried and tested and have well and truly been found wanting.",1384819200,5,1650,4.273311897106109

8307386,5,B001GXMUB2,"I hesitated before I purchased this DVD.  But I am so glad I did. Watching this DVD was a major turning point in my life.  I have watched it four times since. And I plan to watch it some more. There are many visuals.  Sally does an excellent job of explaining things in a very simple manner which makes it easy for people like me who are not scientific to understand exactly what is going on at the technical level.  Her presentations are also full of clear stories, pictures that explain concepts.  For topics which, at times, may make you sad, Sally will relale them with a light sense of humor.  On another note, at times during the DVD, you cannot help but experience a sense of sadness towards what is going with the food and how it is hurting so many of us, our children and our dear ones, but Sally skillfully addresses this at the end of her DVD with a very tiny non-preachy segment on forgiveness which is a very nice ending to the whole series. The whole DVD makes you think. It really makes you ponder.  It forces you to re-evaluate things. Life and the world.  And your life.  After watching this DVD, things really changed for me.  I knew the direction I needed to take to really take better charge of my health. I thought I always had, but this DVD made me realize that there was a lot I was not aware of.  It was my wake-up call.  And it changed my life and the life of my family for the better.",1297382400,9,1410,4.220149253731344
8307387,5,B001GXMUB2,This dvd accompanies Sally Fallon's cookbook very well but is equally informative on its own. Many of the principles and issues mentioned in her book are dealt with in detail e.g. raw milk and which types of fat to eat. The information is made fun and interesting with photos by Dr. Price as well as simple graphs and studies that were conducted. I really enjoyed this dvd- it is well worth the price considering how it unravels some of the mysteries surrounding our modern diets. Highly recommended!,1281225600,12,500,4.758620689655173
