I can't watch the show again on DVD because it's not closed captioned but I urge everyone who can to do so. Such marvelous animals.",1344384000,,284,4.68
8103841,5,B000E1FE3I,"I watched this program on Nature on PBS tonight and it was an excellent insight into Polar Bears, their lives and their relationship with humans in this remote Canadian town.  The host does a wonderful job of sharing his expertise and excitement as he gets up close with these wonderful animals and those dedicated to their preservation.  I have always enjoyed and admired Polar Bears and it is difficult to top the Nature series.  This was a very pleasant surprise and I am ordering it for a good friend who shares my interest.",1137283200,,528,4.655913978494624
