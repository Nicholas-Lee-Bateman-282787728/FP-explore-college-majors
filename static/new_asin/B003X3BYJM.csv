4215693,5,B003X3BYJM,"I was amazed at how well this Film was made, from beginning to end this film gave a perfect depiction of how things are in Mexico. their are two sides to every story and this film shows the side that is less seen. We need to stop privatizing and trying to take aadvantage of our fellow man under the color of our skin we are all the same. This film was excellent and I would recomend it to anyone.",1305676800,6,397,4.037974683544304
4215694,5,B003X3BYJM,This documentary has givin me so much insight and understanding of what these people are going through and what pushes them north. Between NAFTA and government corruption they have no chance at a descent living. I to would do what ever it takes to provide for my family. I only wish my fellow countrymen/woman that look down on these people would educate themselves on this matter.,1305590400,4,381,4.787878787878788
4215695,5,B003X3BYJM,"This documentary brought tears to my Mexican husband's eyes.  It was done with such compassion.  I really wish that I could say it would make a difference with the people who have the power to do something about the situation, but I doubt it.  What it does do, is point out the Mexican government's part in the illegal immigration issue.  If the government doesn't help its own people, who will?
This is a very moving documentary, but it made me feel helpless.  Germano did an excellent job and I hope that, at the very least, it will make some Mexicans aware that there is help available from their government, but that they have to pursue it, because the government doesn't publicize it.
With the freedom of speech we have in the U.S., I think we sometimes get carried away criticizing our government.  Viewing a documentary like this one makes a person appreciate what he has.  For all its faults, our government is still one of the best, in my opinion.  If not, I don't think all those undocumented persons would be struggling so hard to get here.
This was a very thought-provoking documentary and very well done.",1304035200,11,1117,4.634517766497462
4215696,5,B003X3BYJM,"I first saw this film at a screening in my university and I absolutely loved it. It gave me great insight into the lives of ordinary Mexicans who come to the United States looking for opportunity and work. In a time when America is so divided and xenophobic, I believe this video will help further our understanding of the reasons why so many Mexicans migrate into the United States as political and economic refugees each year. I recommend this film to anyone who may want to learn more about our neighbors in Mexico.",1284076800,48,518,4.580645161290323
4215697,5,B003X3BYJM,"This documentary provides the viewer an opportunity to understand the sacrifices mexicans endure to work in the US.  It captures the reality and emotions of hard working people from Mexico that only want to provide for their families. Most importantly anyone that sees this film will no doubt feel compassion for families left behind in Mexico, and especially for those here in the US living in anguish without their loved ones.",1282176000,25,428,5.028169014084507
4215698,5,B003X3BYJM,The Other Side of Immigration shows the stories of Mexican immigrants that are so often lost in the sea of bigotry and racism that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration.  The documentary contains real information and is not riddled with the propaganda that most documentaries feature.  All US lawmakers should be required to view this movie before they make any kind of decision on immigration reform.  Perhaps it would help them think outside the box of securing country borders.,1282089600,9,485,5.113924050632911
4215699,5,B003X3BYJM,This film provides an excellent depiction regarding the impact U.S. policy has had on Mexico and why it encourages immigration to the U.S.. I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone.,1282089600,6,192,5.03125
4215700,5,B003X3BYJM,When I first viewed this film I thought this is a perspective that is usually lost in the debate about immigration in the US. We always look at the impact on US society but not the impact on the sending communities. Roy Germano does a great job of bringing forth these issues into the debate about immigration. It is a well made thought provoking film that will leave you wanting to learn more about immigration. Use it in class or to start a discussion about immigration as a human issue and not a political issue.,1282089600,5,515,4.431578947368421
4215701,5,B003X3BYJM,"This is a well-made documentary that provides a much needed perspective within the broader immigration debate. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn more about immigration, or anyone who teaches about immigration. The director/producer talks to many people, providing the viewer with a well-grounded and complex discussion of an issue that so often is simplified in the media.",1281916800,32,387,5.466666666666667
4215714,5,B003X3BYJM,I absolutely loved what you did in this video. It was solely based on those who have migrated and their families. It was such an eye openner and reminded me what everyone goes through and how so many things need to be changed. It was an easy watch and I was nodding my head and gasping many times. Great job! :),1475366400,,311,4.114754098360656
4215715,5,B003X3BYJM,"A well made, eye opening film that gives viewers an idea of what immigration is to those on the ""other side"" of the border. I love that the entire documentary is told from the perspective of immigrants and their families rather than a narrator. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1474329600,2,291,4.615384615384615

4215719,5,B003X3BYJM,"Very interesting documentary about the struggles of illegal immigration. It doesn't apologize for the illegal crossings, but simply puts some perspective as the WHY it is necessary for these people. Thought-provoking.",1460764800,,217,6.032258064516129
4215720,4,B003X3BYJM,Good information for students...their response was it was just a bit slow but worth the experience.,1456531200,,99,5.25
4215721,5,B003X3BYJM,"Excellent. Contains essential information for understanding the role of NAFTA and its collaborators in devastating the families of one of two majorly marginalized working class groups: the Mexican rural farmers pre 1980 and their counterparts world wide. The other is the American blue collar worker and their counterparts world wide. Cartel Land is a start to understanding that while immigrants came to this country, driven from their communities by NAFTA, they were also taking not the jobs that no one wants, they were taking blue collar jobs from tens of millions of blue collar workers who valued their jobs greatly . The refrain that ""they are only her to take the jobs no one wants"" is one of the biggest, most shameful and destructive lies ever told. We will never be able to stop the cycle of violence until we understand and accept this and understand that the real problem is the phenomena of  market dominate minorities, wherever they are from and whatever ethnicity they are. For that, see Amy Chua's World on Fire. For bringing it all together, see Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine.",1456012800,3,1093,4.940217391304348
4215722,5,B003X3BYJM,"SHOULD BE MANDATORY VIEWING FOR ALL AMERICANS. The majority of people crossing illegally from Mexico don't want to stay here -- they want to work and go home. They can't work at home because so called free trade has raped their countryside of work opportunities. And they dread having to make those scary crossings. So why in the eff can't we give them safe passage - not to mention - instead of investing in a stupid wall, invest in Mexico's rural countrysides that so called free trade has destroyed? UGH -- this approach would be a whole lot cheaper to what it costs to deal with all the deportation crap--and both sides would benefit tremendously. OY vey -- if only Donald Trump and his Republican cronies would take a look at this. You should, too. A+ film.",1455408000,8,762,4.569343065693431
4215723,5,B003X3BYJM,"Making an informed decision means educating yourself on the issue as a whole; regardless of what your personal views on immigration are, it's important that your view isn't one-sided. This documentary is very informative on the issue of immigration from the southern side of the border. It's presents the stories and facts as they are as opposed to being politically driven, it's an honest look at the other side of immigration. There are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". It's short and sweet, very beautifully shot. I highly recommend watching it.",1455148800,,545,5.0
4215724,5,B003X3BYJM,"Very insightful, shows a not-often-talked-about perspective of what it means to be an immigrant to the US and who is left behind when immigrants leave home",1449014400,,155,5.0

4215730,5,B003X3BYJM,"I work in a city where there is an increasing population of Latinos and resultantly their presence as customers requiring my workplace's services.  It was my observation that all too often, the lack of language skills, the presence of extended family and, most notably, young children as language interpreters was seen as reason and excuse for poor service delivery on the part of some staff.  On a volunteer basis, I requested that they each view this DVD; which, I'm very pleased to say, resulted in a dramatically different sense and sensibility of this population/customer segment.",1426032000,6,585,5.147368421052631

4215739,3,B003X3BYJM,"Provides an interview-based perspective on the political and economical flaws that are affecting Mexican citizens.  Good range of individuals interviewed.  However, the evidence provided (via interviews) is generalized at times (""Mexican government is one of the most corrupt in the world"").  This film is a more experiential than facts/data documentary.  Worth the view for those unfamiliar with Mexico's issues.",1408060800,2,413,5.9491525423728815
4215740,5,B003X3BYJM,This documentary is the necessary telling of the Mexican side of the immigration tale.  So many people do not realize what it is like for the actual immigrants and why they cannot stay full time in their homelands.  This documentary illustrate the plight of immigrants and was something I shared with my family because I do not want my children growing up ignorant about the world they live in.  This documentary has excellent interviews and really depicts important aspects of the economy in Mexico and how it has changed because of corporate farmers in the USA.  I highly recommend this film.,1406160000,5,594,4.851485148514851
4215741,5,B003X3BYJM,I have had this product on my wish list for quite a while.  I'm so glad I finally decided to but it.,1403136000,2,100,3.5454545454545454
4215742,4,B003X3BYJM,Immigration has a lot of sides to it.  This is about what happens in Mexico and why people feel pushed to emigrate and how this affects their economy and people's traditional life.  It has created nothing but ghost towns.,1399420800,4,221,4.641025641025641

4215746,5,B003X3BYJM,Excellent documentary on the causes of immigration. I highly recommend it. I showed it to my students and it really opened their eyes on the issue and causes of immigration.,1385337600,2,173,4.8
4215747,4,B003X3BYJM,It offers great foundation for discussion and perspective on the topic.  Giving it only 4 stars because I'm the librarian and only heard it through the teacher I purchased it for!  ;),1385078400,,183,4.6875
4215748,5,B003X3BYJM,I saw this in the theater and then I showed it to my summer school World History class.  It's entirely in Spanish with subtitles; that may bother some people. The interviews are poignant and reveal the real reasons people come to the US illegally. Some of my students were stunned that the Mexican government was so corrupt and easily influenced by the ready dollar.  Some of my Hispanic students had no idea that food was imported into Mexico. The film ultimately shows that the illegal person working in the United States is here because he HAS to be and not because he wants to be.,1373241600,11,584,4.552380952380952
4215749,5,B003X3BYJM,"This video is a must for anyone trying to understand the larger perspective of the immigration issue.  Our politicians take the high road but when you watch the interviews with the people who are coming here and the government officials who see the process first hand you see that we are not the good guys. Like all issues, it is complicated and easy answers don't do justice to the human and economic issues involved.",1372723200,5,418,4.648648648648648
4215750,4,B003X3BYJM,"This documentary shows the ""other side"" of immigration - from the side of the immigrants themselves.  It is somewhat long, but a very well-done documentary offering the human and inside story of the folks that feel the need to come to the US to make a living.  Very interesting!",1368057600,,278,4.653061224489796
4215751,3,B003X3BYJM,"The film was compelling and offered a different perspective on immigration at the Mexican border. The visuals and audio were less interesting than I expected , but still well worth watching for content.",1362873600,,202,5.151515151515151
4215752,5,B003X3BYJM,"This is among the best documentaries I have viewed. Very well done!
With immigration a real ""hot button"" issue in our country, it is extremely important to see the other side of the problem.  So often, we only think of our own personal views and experiences without any knowledge of what life is like for others. As was expressed in the film, there ARE solutions to this problem. The governments CAN find solutions if they want to, and try.
This film was definitely worth the money! I wil be sharing it with small groups in my church who sincerely want what is best for ALL people ~ men, women, and children ~ no matter race or creed.",1362614400,5,634,4.418803418803419

4215755,5,B003X3BYJM,"This really showed the ""other side of immigration"" and how the aid is not getting down to the people of Mexico and the effects of NAFTA on their economy and how it limits their choices of how to provide for their families.  It doesn't give answers, hey, we don't have answers right now, but it definitely explained the problem and concerns.",1355875200,,340,4.573770491803279
4215756,5,B003X3BYJM,This film gives a very balanced look at undocumented immigration and how it is played out in the local level. Use it as a kick start for yearly immigration project.,1353196800,,164,4.5

4215758,5,B003X3BYJM,"This documentary is in one word amazing! The one person that gave it a one star obviously did so Bc they don't posses an open mind. It does not at any time try to persuade any one to think that illigal immigration is ok. The movie just shows people why it happens and lets you see the cases of human beings. I reccommend everyone to watch this movie and if you have to cast judgement on this issue do it with un biast sources, we were all at one point immigrants after all.",1332374400,,473,4.096774193548387
4215759,5,B003X3BYJM,"Of course immigration between Mexico and the United States is a complicated issue, not to mention economics and how government operates, and this documentary touches the surface of this.  However, it is very well done and seems to offer a simple yet compelling guide into why we have the problem we have. If anyone wonders why some Mexicans immigrate to the US however they can, here's your briefing on what's going on.",1332028800,,419,4.819444444444445
4215760,5,B003X3BYJM,"Nearly everyone who reviewed this film found it honest and worthwhile.  So did I.  I hope there's a version of it for Mexican viewers, since it shows the corruption on both sides of the border.

As for the reviewer who sneered at the filmmakers for being ""bleeding hearts"", let me remind him or her that a bleeding heart is a symbol for mourning and compassion in many world religions from Hinduism to Christianity.  I'm a Unitarian Universalist and it's not one of our symbols, but we have taken on compassionate immigration reform as one of our major religious challenges.  Other faith organizations have, too.

The tangled critical problems depicted in this film include issues as big as massive global hunger, freshwater privatization, population pressure, climate change, and treating other living beings as exploitable commodities.  There are only three kinds of responses to such problems.  We must choose what we want to be.  Either we become do-gooders, or do-badders, or do-nothings.  I'm proud to be a do-gooder.  Except among the most cynical hypocrites, the do-badders and do-nothings often start from ignorance of reality. They haven't been taught about the issue, but propagandized with spin from highly biased, well-funded sources.  A few scared persons desperately insist on remaining ignorant of reality, they'll disbelieve the storm until it blows their house away, and they are to be pitied.  But most persons who've been do-nothings or do-badders respond to the truth, which is why caring people make films like this one. The filmmakers know that seeing a vivid presentation of reality will wake many people out of their dream-and/or-nightmare-land, prod them to engage in further study, and start them on the path of doing some good in the world.

I hope the same team now makes a film to expose the lies and myths of the rich and powerful anti-immigrant lobby.  There's plenty of evidence from state and federal records that immigrants, including illegal ones, pay far more in taxes that they ever take in benefits. People need to know that most TV ""news"" programs have become corporate shills.  They tell lies--and a court decision in Florida now permits them to lie all the time.",1329782400,6,2204,5.06371191135734
4215761,1,B003X3BYJM,"Typical one-sided bleeding heart view of why Mexicans risk their lives to break the law, defraud others and enter illegally. This movie skips over the harsh facts of most border crossings: 80% of the women that cross with the help of a coyote are raped, many die in the desert or drown in the river, most all are taken advantage of by their own people and the coyotes who they pay, then abandon them or even kill them for the money. There is no justifiable excuse to commit crimes, break the laws and harm others. It also does not cover the continued law breaking these illegal immigrants commit after they have entered the US (purchasing fraudulent and stolen ID and documentation which ruins an innocent person's credit, applying for all sorts of free assistance from state and federal sources and lying on the applications (fraud), working for cash and not paying any taxes, etc.) This movie is a waste of time and a lie.",1329264000,15,924,4.640243902439025
