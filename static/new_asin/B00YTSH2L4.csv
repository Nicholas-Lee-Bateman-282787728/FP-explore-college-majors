I was literally laughing aloud during these two episodes, and I have seen them many times before. The writing on this show was amazing, and I only wish there were comedies on television today that are  as sharp as this one.

The DVD was in perfect condition and arrived very quickly.",1461974400,4,414,4.434210526315789

7269297,5,B00YTSH2L4,Not the best season of the series but as a fan of the show for me its a must have. Season 3 ended in a cliffhanger so you need this to resolve that. This season also ends in a cliffhanger so you'll need Season5 to resolve that. (On my list.) Not the DVDs fault it's the way network TV attempted to keep its viewers..,1448150400,6,316,3.953125

Although season four is probably my least favorite due to the back-and-forth between Fran and Mr. Sheffield over the thing,  its still great to have.  The packaging isn't quite as nice as seasons one and two were, but it still has a list of the episodes and a brief synopsis unlike season three.  Overall, any Nanny fan will be happy with this purchase.",1519084800,,506,4.351063829787234

Nanny Fran Fine (Fran Drescher) and the Sheffields are up to all-new shenanigans and misadventures in this fresh and funny 4th Season, which delivers not only big laughs but big guest stars (including Bette Midler, Donald Trump, Pamela Anderson, Celine Dion, Jon Stewart, Jason Alexander, and Joan Collins, to name a few!).",1515628800,,483,5.285714285714286
