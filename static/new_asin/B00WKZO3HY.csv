the actors  are  great  and  germany  has everything to  explore  much  more  about this matter",1446508800,,189,4.833333333333333
7132978,5,B00WKZO3HY,"It is a very good movie, delivered on time, in good condition. A little strange and poingent. But still very good, The only thing I could see to make this a better movie is if I could get a full refund since I have burned a copy",1445299200,,228,3.872340425531915
7132979,5,B00WKZO3HY,"I do not agree with the previous review. I think it's a plus that some questions remain unanswered.

And maybe some things are just the way they are, they might be swingers because of Markus's inability to finish sex with his wife. He might have talked his wife into the swinger life, to be able to satisfy his sexual needs, the man is obviously sexually frustrated, that might explain the anger.

And there is a relationship between mother and daughter, but it doesnt seem to be a healthy one. Elisabeth might blame her mother for the unhappiness of her father. The fact that Elisabeth  did call her mother a whore, suggests Elisabeth is somehow aware of the swinger lifestyle.
When the mother is putting on some make up after a fight with dad, Elisabeth might conclude that she's going for another man. Who knows, it might just be Elisabeth's immagination.

And about the noose, it confirms the depression of Elisabeth's mother, or at least the fact that she is mentally unstable. That Elisabeth's mum walks away from the noose, might not make sence, but maybe thats the thing about mental problems, you might behave in a way that  doesnt make sence.

I think these strange and confusing scenes make this movie more interesting!",1442102400,6,1230,4.751173708920188
7132980,2,B00WKZO3HY,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I first read the press release for THE SUMMER HOUSE, I was immediately intrigued.  The plot sounded like it could have been pulled from todays news headlines, and it immediately piqued my interest.  Unfortunately, the execution of the plot in the film does not play out as well as it does on paper.  The resulting film is a lackluster piece of jumbled ideas and mixed messages.  In short, THE SUMMER HOUSE is a bit of a letdown for me.

The disappointment with this film does not start immediately.  In fact, around the halfway point is when my frown started.  Prior to that, the film was faring decentlynot perfect, but entertaining nonetheless.  However, when the disappointment starts, it never stops.

THE SUMMER HOUSE is shot well, but that is not enough to save it.  The film has too many flaws, both in regard to character and plot, and the concept behind the narrative never truly comes into fruition.  As such, there are many dramatic things happening between the characters, however no explanation is ever given as to why.

For example, early in the film, Markus and his wife, Christine, have dinner with a colleague and his girlfriend.  The group chats for a few momentsand then an orgy ensues.  Moments later, we see Markus having sex with his wifeonly to stop in anger and angst, and storm off.  Theres no mention of why they are swingers or what this has to do with the story.  The same can be said with Markuss inability to finish sex with his wife.

Then there is the relationship between Christine and their daughter, Elisabeth.  We are led to believe early on that they have a tight-knit mother/daughter bond.  But halfway through the film, Elisabeth uses lipstick to write the word WHORE on her mothers mirror.  Why??  When Christine sees the word, she becomes distraught and wipes it offyet she never says anything.  The lack of development here is very confusing all the way around.

Finally, a peculiar scene later on in THE SUMMER HOUSE pretty much puts the nail in the coffin for me on this film.  Christine is upset about Markus distant feelings for her.  So, she makes a noose that hangs down in the path of front door, gets a chair, stands on it, and loops her head through it.  When Elisabeth asks what shes doing, Christine says Just playing a game, sweetie.  A moment later, Markus opens the door and sees Christine.  She threatens to step off the chair if Markus comes in the house, so he turns around and leaves.  After hes gone, Christine undoes the nooseand then goes on like nothing happened.

These examples are just a few of the curious and weird aspects of this film.  Granted, the primary storyline is pretty interesting (and I like how the end plays out), but neither of those positives are enough to save THE SUMMER HOUSE, either.

As such, I cannot recommend THE SUMMER HOUSE.  It is too confusing and too jumbled to follow for my tastes.  The film is available now, however, if you decide to take a look.",1441929600,7,3025,4.62218045112782
7132981,5,B00WKZO3HY,I stumbled upon this movie and after a bit i realized what the subject matter was almost turning  it off but as i went on i realized it was made well with good acting with a lot of current issues without falling into something that some of the lower raters wanted it to be which made it a good movie and watchable .,1497398400,,315,4.0

7132986,3,B00WKZO3HY,It was a good movie - well acted and directed - good shooting etc... The downside is that it promises a view of a grown man and his relationship with a young boy and we really don't get that. It really doesn't go very deep into any of the relationships - a little disappointing in that respect.,1483920000,3,294,4.175438596491228

7132999,5,B00WKZO3HY,"BRAVO!  Five Stars!
This film could have been a snapshot of live in America, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands...anywhere.  It was eye-opening.
Yes, the subject matter in this movie is disturbing.  No doubt.  Now, let's talk about the art.
This psycho-sexual family drama is heavy laden with real issues.  The movie is clearly a cautionary tale, but more than that the writers and director(s) posed to us a very real portrait of troubled people and troubled families.  It makes us ask the question:  Is my family life what I want it to be?  In this film we see a forgotten daughter; a self-obsessive wife and mother; two fathers not in touch with their families; a sociopathic boy.  What we didn't foresee is the ending.  Wow!",1455753600,5,725,4.728

8713699,3,B00WKZO3HY,"I thought this was an ""OK"" film.  It moved very slowly and the ending was strange and, to me, not realistic. However, it is probably a good thing that the movie dealt with pedophilia.  This too often not talked about. However, it's listed as a GLTB film and pedophilia is none of those.",1534377600,,286,4.377358490566038
8713700,5,B00WKZO3HY,"If you know and like the stories of the American Southern author Flannery O'connnor, you love this movie. Like her stories, this one is just enough off the course of normalcy for one to take notice but only slightly. Then the incredible ending (this doesn't give anything away) throws you totally off guard; a ending you'd never imagine in a million years. This is clever, totally different from the predictable plot of most movies. Great job.",1526256000,,443,4.842105263157895
