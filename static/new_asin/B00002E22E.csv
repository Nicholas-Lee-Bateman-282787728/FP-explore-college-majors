1253892,4,B00002E22E,"It really is a classic. Outstanding performances by Streep and Neil. The script is well balanced and not over written for the already dramatic story. Streep is not the whimpering Disney mother you would expect to find in an American tragedy of the same magnitude but keeps on track in a truely Australian down to Earth manner. Some have called the movie ""campy"" and ""tripe"", I'd prefer to call it "" no thrills because it makes it real.",1477267200,,435,4.589743589743589

1253894,4,B00002E22E,"I initially wanted to find a widescreen version of Australian Director Fred Schepisi's 1980's classic western Barbarosa.  That travesty of re-issue incompetence at least reminded me that Schepisi directed A CRY IN THE DARK a mostly infuriating indictment on perception, prejudice, and ultimately injustice.
A CRY IN THE DARK offers fine insight on this somewhat unusual Australian family's ""Adventists"" belief and an inevitable media frenzy that does not just display its quick to judge, false misrepresentations in ""The States"".
This is a solid movie with fine performances by Meryll Streep (her 8th(!) Oscar namination) and Sam Neill as the spouses whose baby is taken from a tent during a ""communal"" type religious outing.
And those famous words that became a comic-tag-line by Elaine (Julia Louis Dreyfuss) in the Seinfeld tv episode:  ""The dingo took my ba-bay.""  Yes, from this movie.
But, watching the terror in a mother's eyes, slowly realizing what has just happened -- it is still kind of difficult to watch; and certainly something no parent would want to dwell on ... until the accusations arise.  Again, truly an infuriating true story of how people are so quick to judge and condemn those who are ""a little different.""
A CRY IN THE DARK was, certainly, worth seeing again.  Originally released in 1988.  Widescreen is the way to see this well made Fred Schepisi almost a classic.
Now, could we just get a widescreen Barbarosa release.?!",1465516800,,1450,5.09704641350211

1253959,5,B00002E22E,"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see.",1420416000,,1276,5.139423076923077

1253990,5,B00002E22E,"This is one of those films which should be mandatory viewing for every individual who desires to help humanity became more just, more rational, more bound by truth and fact instead of lie and innuendo.  No one deserves the overwhelming injustice foisted upon the Chamberlain family (on top of an already egregious personal tragedy) yet societies will continue to repeat these type of mistakes unless we each make it a priority to learn from the past.

My teen-aged sons felt the middle of the movie -- pertaining to the trial -- was boring and dragged on for too long; I have to concede that to someone of a tender age, this might be a valid point.  But I appreciate that the director was trying to stay faithful to the original (true), story so this aspect as never bothered me (and I have viewed this film repeatedly over the years).

If you have not seen A Cry in the Dark, you must -- for the stunning photography of Ayers Rock in Australia (an amazing natural landform), for the incredible acting by Meryl Streep and Sam Neill, and -- of course -- for the shocking reality of how their characters suffered for society's irrational prejudices, biases and misdeeds.  It is my opinion that the public at large did not want to believe wild dingoes posed the horrific danger to young children they clearly did, and so they turned a blind eye to the obvious facts about Azaria Chamberlain's demise.  This was made easier by the fact that the family belonged to a misunderstood and sometimes reviled religious sect (Seventh Day Adventist).  Both of these factors are ones which exist today, so the film remains critically relevant.",1405036800,,1629,4.714788732394366

While far from candy-ass, it is surprisingly tame considering the subject matter. Streep and Neill both give commendable performances, and there is also some wonderful scenery. Set in '80, filmed in '88, it's a nostalgic experience for those of us old enough to remember those times, not that I notice any really glaring differences between then and now.

1254041,5,B00002E22E,"I think a lot of the initial negative publicity about this film stemmed from the fact in the 1980s many people refused to believe a wild dog could take a baby and kill it.  Since 1980 in Australia, many studies and inquests have concluded that dingos are a wild and capable animal to attack and kill small children and babies.

As for the film itself, Streep and Neill deliver fantastic performances.  If you do any type of search on YouTube for the real Lindy Chamberlain, you'll see that Streep portrays her perfectly:  Strong-willed, intelligent, and abrasive---qualities that makes you understand why public sentiment may have found it difficult to support her during this time.  Apparently the public wanted to see a woman who could barely walk and kept crying all the time, and that is not Lindy Chamberlain.

The story is incredible and if it had not actually happened, no one would believe it.  Meryl Streep is superb as the young wife of a Seventh Day Adventist minister in Australia, who, on a camping trip, sees a wild dingo carry off her baby.  As if that weren't enough, she is accused of killing the child.

Steep plays the woman brilliantly.  At first she is the sweet and demure young minister's wife, full of love for her family.  As the horror of her predicament unfolds we see her change into a woman of steel.  Due to an excellent script and Streeps fine acting, the character is totally believable through all of the twists and turns of her fate.

Sam Neill is her equal in this performance as the deeply religious man whose faith is questioned by the event.

What is most shocking is the rabid attention the public paid to the case and their blood thirst for Lindy's head. Insult is piled on injury on this poor family, and it seems that much of the reason for it is the fact that they were members of the Seventh Day Adventist faith.

It's a cautionary tale for everyone.  Not a pleasant film to watch but an important one.",1270771200,,1246,4.373913043478261

I know that that may sound harsh, but I dare you to watch this harrowing film and not find yourself thinking the same way.  I couldn't help but close my eyes in agony during sections of this film, my wife gasping as we took in everything that this poor family had to suffer and endure; to no fault of their own besides maybe a poor decision that should have never been held over their heads.

In the middle of the night a dingo snuck into the tent in which their 10-week old daughter Azaria was sleeping and ran off with her.  A search was started yet her body was never found, and when the search was ended the witch-hunt began as the community and the media launched an all out attack on the family, especially the mother Lindy, trying to pin her down for the murder of her child.

You think that the worst thing that can happen to a parent is to lose a child; but that pain seems minimal when you find yourself accused of taking their life.

`Evil Angels' recounts the court proceedings that followed the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain as her family is tormented and persecuted and mercilessly attacked by everyone around them.  It is true that we live in a world where young children are killed and or abused daily, and many times by a parent, but we also live in a world where you are supposed to remain innocent until proven guilty, and no guilt was every proven against Lindy or Michael Chamberlain, which makes their treatment all the more devastating.

Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are superb as the crushed souls known as Michael and Lindy Chamberlain.  They each dominate their characters, truly sinking into the thoughts and actions and wreckage that comes from this unforeseen situation.  Neill embodies Michael with such sympathy and pain; his eyes bleeding with this uncomfortable sadness that scratches at his heart.  As the court proceedings carry on and his relationship with Lindy becomes strained you can really see that he is trying to understand what is happening to him, but his mind can't grasp it; or maybe it doesn't want to.  Meryl Streep is a revelation as Lindy.  Lindy deals with her situation in stark contrast to her husband, forcing herself to find humor in her treatment to deaden the pain; but when she takes the stand and her countenance falls and she starts to crumble you begin to understand that she is not as cold as she appears.

You realize just how badly she has been damaged by the actions of everyone around her.

`Evil Angels' is a very hard film to stomach.  It reminds me much of `The Crucible' in that both films (true life accounts mind you) expose the cruelty and inhumane ways of humans in desperate situations.  Through both films I felt this heat within my veins that boiled into full-fledged anger and frustration in people.  Maybe it's because I am a parent, but even if I were not I still feel as if this film would have wounded me so-to-speak.  The script, actors, direction and mere tone of the film only help to elevate the inevitable devastation, to such a degree that the ending solace seems more token and less gratifying.

This film is superb.",1217894400,,3548,4.547169811320755

This is the opposite of those movies that make you feel good about humanity and the world we live in ... This incredible true story makes you wonder how we call this civilization or justice.

Meryl Streep is tremendous as Mrs. Chamberlain, wife to a pastor husband, who experiences tragedy early on in the film.  But the film focuses more on the tragedy that later befalls their lives as compassion and humanity are trampled by ignorance, rumor, hatred, and stubbornness.

Their story is amazing.  It is sad and it makes you cry.  And it will haunt you for some time.  I believe there are few things scarier than being innocent and yet being unable to prove it because others believe in your guilt so diligently and blindly.  Like Hitchcock's The Wrong Man, Cry in the Dark will leave its stain upon you, but will also give you hope in the end.

1254057,5,B00002E22E,"Goes to show how far a little prejudice will go. After warnings that Dingos were becoming a dangerous problem at Ayer's Rock, baby Azaria's tragic death was bound to happen to someone's child sooner or later. Unfortunately, many didn't realize just how powerful an animal the Dingo is. Like many here in the U.S. don't realize the dangers of our even smaller Coyote. And unfortunately for the Chamberlain family, smaller minority churches like their membership in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, made them subjects of suspicion and rumors. Their marriage was eventually destroyed over this crisis.

This film portrayed so well, how a little gossip and stereotyping can explode into hatred. Little known to most even today, is that there was a large cover-up from law enforcement, down to members of the local community, who were aware that a well known local Dingo was responsible for Azaria's death. Yet, many still refuse to accept Lindy Chamberlain's total innocence of her baby's death. The average viewer of this film would be totally sickened by the full revelation of this tragic event.

Meryl Streep's performance, is possibly the best movie portrayal of someone not actually born a native to the country of her character's origin. Her Australian accent is delivered to perfection. Very much worthy of the 8th Academy Award nomination she received. A strong argument for religious tolerance, and keeping cool heads till all the facts are in. And a great edition to any DVD collection, though some strong language for what essentially is a faith-based film may discourage some from viewing.

Bigotry against the couple's religion.  Scattershot forensics evidence taken as fact.  And a hysteria that was the 1980s equivalent of a Salem witch hunt...thus says the box on this riveting true story.

Director Fred Schepisi captures the media outrage that condemned a couple for a murder that didn't exist, as the couple's infant was carried off by a wild dingo.  Receiving her 8th Oscar nomination, Meryl Streep is pitch perfect as Lindy.  One can see however why the media didn't warm up to her story:  she seems steely, almost unaffected, until her final statements in the courtroom.

1254070,5,B00002E22E,"Michael and Lindy Chamberlain (Sam Neill and Meryl Streep)  must endure the double horror of having their infant baby carried off by a dingo and then being convicted in a-- forgive me-- kangaroo court of the child's death. This movie, which grips you early on and never lets you go, sad to say, is based on a true incident that occurred in Australia in 1980. The Chamberlains, who are devout Seventh-Day Adventists, are guilty of being different. They are tried by both the public and media. Hysteria and rumor run rampant while reason and justice get lost in a rush to judgment.
With the possible exception of IRON WEED, Meryl Streep has never made a bad movie. She is perfect here as the mother who has hope against hope that the truth will out and she will be found innocent. With an awful haircut-- the old bowl over your head look-- and the additional weight she apparently gained (she is pregnant during her trial) she manages to almost look plain and frumpy. Sam Neill as her fundamentalist minister husband gives an outstranding performance as well. The scenes of the Australian outback are beautiful.
The theme is timeless: too often to be different is to be evil. If you are different, then you are not a person; and I can ignore the evidence and find you guilty of heinous crimes. Unfortunately, the Austalians in 1980 were not unique in this disease. One only has to remember the recent debacle of innocent inmates on death row in Illinois who were found to be innocent with new DNA evidence. Then there's Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the 1950's. There's still questions about whether they were guilty of the crimes for which they were executed. The list goes on and on.",1084492800,,1683,4.666666666666667

As the country listens, rumors circulate that she killed her baby.  The family either stays tighter knit or almost separates.  Much drama occurs during the turmoil of losing a family member and being called the antichrist.  Regardless of what's said in interviews, no one listens.
Meryl Streep deserved her eighth Oscar nomination for Best Actress as the accused mother.  Streep gives much of her own nightmare thoughts into the screen.  Just her expressed emotions are enough to give the audience chills while causing them to almost cry.  Sam Neill gives the best performance of his career as the accusee's husband.  All 350 acting extras also give great performance.
The writers greatly informed the audience of the real events.  It digs deep into every characters' raw emotions.  The director and the producers wonderfully led the cast and crew to their highest potential.  This is one of the top ten best movies released in 1988.

I was at the time a master control operator at Channel Seven in Melbourne and on duty when the news of a missing baby at Ayres Rock in Central Australia came thru. I had the job of organizing the television signals from the Rock to our network in Melbourne.
It was quite a task and seeing the events unfold on the DVD, I again revisited my own part of the overall picture of history.
Further to this event, my 3 year old daughter [Nicolette] was eventually to play the role of Kahalia Chamberlain in Fred Schepschi's film and appears in the final 3 scenes.
I still work in the TV/Film industry and occasionally look back at this excellent piece of dramatised history as a genuine piece of work, accurately played out and presented.

With this in mind, I would like to object to an early comment about ""the blood thirsty, bigoted morbid folk of Australia."" My mother, with many of her friends, campaigned on Lindy Chamberlain's behalf at the time and although there are others with opposing views it hardly warrants that kind of stereotype. I doubt that as an Irish person that the reviewer would like to be judged by some of the ridiculous cliches and stereotypes about the Irish.

1254075,5,B00002E22E,"Gather three Australians and turn the conversation from footy to the Lindy Chamberlain case.  One of you is almost certain to survive the encounter.  Although the survivor will almost certainly be only you.  Still arousing the highest passions among Australians, the death of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the subsequent jailing of her mother for murder remains the most noted legal and social episode there.  Even this film and new evidence has failed to clear the Chamberlain's name, indicative of the bizarre circumstances surrounding Azaria's death.  ""The dingo took my baby"" remains a derisive expression in the Australian lexicon.
Spellbinding isn't a trite phrase in describing this film, even if you already know the story. Schepisi keeps the focus tight on the Chamberlains and their dilemma.  A few departures showing Australian public reaction to the case are vivid and pointed.  You are in no doubt as to the feelings engendered.  Azaria's loss and the media's role in helping condemn the Chamberlains aren't wasted moments.  The motivation behind the police desire to make this a murder instead of a dingo attack is strong.  The reason for their intensity isn't clear, but it never was since their treatment of the case was incredibly poor.  The inept handling of evidence by the Northern Territory police is only mildly presented during the courtroom scenes.
As Lindy, Meryl Streep's abilities soared to new heights in this film, as so many here have noted.  Her talent for assuming the role, even that of a living person, is nearly matchless.  Her dominant role in the film is only natural, since the case and the notoriety focused on her almost exclusively.  Sam Neill, as husband Michael, appears almost distracted and confused.  The scene in which she accuses him of virtually abandoning her to the law's persecuting assault on them is particularly vivid.  Both knew the injustice they were suffering, but Lindy/Meryl was the one who lashed out in retaliation.  In Australia, the concept of the ""tall poppy,"" especially assertive women, being ""cut down to size"" is a cultural icon.  Lindy Chamberlain became a ""tall poppy"" in the courtroom and the inevitable result transpired.
Other actors aren't given much space to show their talents.  Lewis Fitz-Gerald, who gave a fine performance in Breaker Morant, is restrained here.  He's no Perry Mason, but the usual lawyer's struggle for justice is reduced here to a visual whimper.  Bruce Myles as the prosecutor is suitably sarcastic in his desire to convict.  He harbours no doubts about the guilt of the Chamberlains.  The conviction seems almost unreal in light of what we see in the film, but it must have been real enough to Lindy Chamberlain, who delivered her fourth child while incarcerated.  The irony of the conviction was recently revived with a dingo attack on a young child on Fraser Island, off the Queensland coast.",1007683200,,2893,5.080508474576271

The twentieth anniversary of the disappearance of Azaria  Chamberlain has just passed and the Chamberlain's separately (they are  separated now and both remarried) fight for compensation from the Northern  Territory Government. Hence the films and Schepsi's ulitmate success is in  that it exists as a time capsule to early 80's terra australis. Evil Angels  is as relevant today as it was when released.

The film is brilliantly shot with sensational  actors,  but it could show some uncertainty in the case. After 20 years the  case is still being ivestigated by a Western Australian police officer who  was there when it all started.

Ask most Americans what they think of those  two and many of them would agree with that opinion, and thus confirming K's  invaluable statement in the bubblegum film Men in Black, and I'm  paraphrasing here ""The individual is smart, but people as a whole are  dumb,stupid and hysterical."" This film is about that hysteria, about  how the public can judge, try and convict complete strangers. Many reviews  of A CRY IN THE DARK call it an attack on the media, but that completely  misses the mark. As Jerry Lewis said in a recent interview ""If you're  looking for a heavy in the piece, then its the people who buy the magazines  and watch the shows"". If you're one of those sad people who obsess on  freak show cases like the O.J. Simpson case or the Jon Benet Ramsey case,  then this film is an attack on you.
  Fred Schepisi's film derives its  power from its absolute realism. He doesn't attempt fancy camera-work but  instead focuses on the anguish and heartbreak brought on the accused  parents, played brilliantly by Sam Neill and Merl Streep. He opens the film  with a shot of the barren and oppressive Australian outback, immediately  thereafter he gives domestic scenes in the Chamberlain household. They are  a picturesque family with faces that beam of happiness and satisfaction as  they plan to take a trip to the outback, it is there that their youngest  daughter Ezaria is stolen and killed by an Australian wild dog named the  Dingo. All the initial public sympathy for the parents evaporates, and  vicious gossip spreads across the country. Since people usually assume the  worst of what they don't understand, they assume that the couple's church  the Seventh-Day Adventists requires ritual sacrifices, wild rumours ensue  as the one claiming the name Ezaria to mean ""sacrifice in the  wilderness"". As Lindy's father quiet eloquently puts it ""The lies  go round the world while the truth is still putting its boots on.""
  The most important piece of eveidence that convicted Lindy in the  public's mind was her unwillingness to act the role of what they precieved  to be a ""normal"" grieving mother. As played by Merly Streep in  arguably her best performance, she is a woman unwilling to censor herself,  to play the part. The couple's blind faith equips them to cope with the  tragedy to an extent no member of the public could ever comprehend. Sam  Neill as Michael is equally good in a more understated performance as a man  who has his faith severely tested.
  Fred Schepisi is one of the most  erratic directors in cinema. I haven't seen all his films, but THE CHANT OF  JIMMIE BLACKSMITH 1978 is one of the most brutal and powerful films I have  ever seen. How he can go from films like that one and A CRY IN THE DARK to  I.Q. and Fierce Creautres is beyond me. I suppose even the great ones run  out of steam sometime. However, his accomplishment here is undeniable, he  manages to do what Oliver Stone failed to do in his overwrought mess  Natural Born Killers, he shows how a judgemental fickle public can destroy  real lives.
  As effective as this film is, it isn't perfect. The visual  style enhances realism, therefore there is no poetry to the tragedy as  there was in Atom Egoyan masterful THE SWEET HEREAFTER. I recognise that  style wasn't what Schepisi was aiming for, but its lack makes re-watching  the film a second time a less enticing prospect. Still, I higly reccomend  that you see this film at least once, and next time you find yourself  debating the guilt or innocence of strangers, remember this film and take a  long hard look in the mirror.",958608000,,3762,4.711864406779661

The acting is what makes this movie work. Streep can claim to be the modern master and this is certainly one of her finest performances.

1254080,5,B00002E22E,"I wish to make a commentry on the Lindy Chamberlain Case in general and in particular what it revealed about Australia as a society - There was not one person in the country who did not have a deeply held opinion on what  actually happened to the poor baby on that tragic night in 1980.  Rearding  the film, I thought it was a work of pure genious. Although I had a deeply  held interest in the Case before I saw the film, which makes me biased I  suppose, there is no doubt in my mind that Meryl Streep gave her best  perfromance to date in this film. She played the part of Lindy Chamberalin  so well that attention is soon deflected from Meryl onto Lindy very early  on into the film. That was certainly the case for me. Meryl melts so well  into her study that you actually forget about Meryl altogether and get  totally wrapped up in the plight of this tragic woman who faces the double  nightmare of not only losing her baby in horrific circumstances but then  facing the trauma of being paraded before an accusing nation for two  painful years before finally winding up behind bars for a crome she did not  commit, which the blood thirsty, bigoted morbid folk of Australia relished  no end.  Let me assure people who were not in Australia during this  extrordinary period - The Chamberalin Case was not viewed simply as a legal  matter to be sorted out in the Courts, rather it was a campaign against  those who did not fit the conventional stereotype and who were out of line  with mainstream thought. Lindy was merely the symbol of such people It  could so easily have been a black person, a gay person etc. As a member of  a Religion which most Australians viewed as a dangerous Cult and as a woman  who did not act in a way most people viewed as ""normal"", she did  not stand a chance form the very start. From the moment those first  questions arose - In the film we see the man in the bar straining as he  holds a bucket in his mouth which he says carries the same weight as that  of a 9 week old baby, to the woman at home watching Lindy's Ayers Rock  Interview fuming that ""you could crack wallnuts on her face"", we  know  that Lindys ordeal has just begun. In short, Lindy Chamberlain was a  dark evil witch to the vast majority of Australian people - Public Opinion  had already convicted Lindy long before her Case came to Trial.  Without  wanting to take the high moral ground, it is a fact that I was one of the  few who believed and continued to believe that Lindy and Michael  Chamberalin were in fact victims of tragic ctrcumstances, tormented because  of a nations intolerence to minority groups. The Film got all the  ingredients that made the Dingo Baby Case truly the Trial of the 20th  Century . What I loved about the film was the major emphisis it placed on  the gossiping populace in the Cafes, Pubs Tennis Clubs etc. - detatched  people who were not known to the two central characters in the film but  who, by their opinions and views, influenced the Trial verdict to a degree  never witnessed in another Trial before or since in any other country. The  focus on Lindy's hairstyle, ""those dresses"" and the star sign of  her Unborn baby, were commented upon and analysed Coast to Coast, Perth to  Sydney, Darwin to Adelaide - everyone had something to say about a certain  Lindy Chamberlain. The whole sage reached unprecentented heights in 1982 -  the year Lindy had her 'official' Trial and one had to be exceptionally  brave to defend a person who by this time was far and away the most hated  woman in the Country.  The Film captures this crucial aspect of the saga  perfectly and because of this and also of course because of  the powerful  performances of Streep and Neill, I give the film full marks.  Finally,  just a few facts for those who still doubt Lindy's innocence (a survey in  May 1998 revealed that a majority of Australians still believe Lindy  murdered her baby! ) :  1 - It was impossible for Lindy to have killed her  baby and covered it up in such a short period of time. Fellow Campers who  had not previously met the Chamberalins gave evidence that Lindy was absent  from the Barbecue Area for just 10 minutes! She left the Barbecue area with  Azaria and her 6 year old Son Aiden to put Azaria to Bed in the Family  Tent. Its incredible to believe what she was supposed to have done in this  time -  Put tracksuit pance over her dress,Brought Azaria to the front seat  of Family car, slit her throat, cleaned up the Car, placed the body of  Azaria in the Camera Bag (! ), changed back into her dress, made Dingo  Tracks around the Tent and after all of this have time to pick up a can of  beans and happily run back to the Barbecue area with her son. It just DID  NOT happen Lindy doubters. Azaria was alive and kicking after Lindy  returned from the Tent.  2 - Even if she the Time, how is it no traces of  blood were found in the Car - the supposed murder venue. The Police claimed  they found blood but this was later dismissed as engine noise dampner. So  where did all the real blood go?  3 - The most conclusive fact that  proves Lindy Innocent. How do the Lindy doubters explain the fact that the  fellow Campers heard a sharp cry coming from the Chamberalin Tent while  Lindy was standing in front of them at the Barbecue area! Afterall this Cry  was heard just minutes after Lindy was supposed to have slaughtered baby  Azaria and stuffed her body in a camera bag..

Watching A CRY IN THE DARK on DVD made me think how much  ahead of its time this film was.  It predated O.J. Simpson and all of the  ""mothers killing children"" stories that have been newsworthy of  late.  (Of course, the story is old news to Australians.)  However, the  film focuses attention on the power of the media and the harm of  ""speculation"".  I think Meryl's character shows us, too, that a  stern, blank face is open for interpretation and imagination.  Because she  did not react in public as we all expect a grieving mother to, then  suspicions arise.
Streep is excellent.  Sam Neal is as well.  The film is  like a puzzle.  It is precise in its depiction of the events surrounding  the child and dingo.  I'm not sure the point of the film is to cast blame  or say these people lied: rather, the film examines the circus around the  events.  And at the heart of the circus is the religious faith of this  couple ... why did God take the child? Why are they being accused?

I just wanted to jump in and  fix everything for them!",926812800,,401,4.541666666666667
