2750049,4,B000MV8AE0,"The best thing going for this movie is Ed Harris' electrifying performance as Beethoven.  He captures Beethoven's musical genius and his dark side, as a rude and crude man.

Other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the story. What I want to comment on is the masterful job done by the screenwriters and the performers of capturing the compositional genius of Beethoven.

What I really liked about the movie:

1) The scenes of Beethoven composing his music

The transformation of Beethoven's egomania to one of thanksgiving:  Initially, Beethoven was mad at God for giving him a musical gift and then making him deaf. He would purposedly make statements about God that border on blasphemy.  Those statements showed his frustration at God for allowing him to become deaf so he could no longer listen to his compositions but had to rely on a earpiece or on vibrations.  Later on, as the film progresses, Beethoven discovers how God speaks to him through music and he makes his peace with God through composing a hymn of thanksgiving towards the end of his life.  His dialogue to Anna about how he can sense the voice of God through music were very moving.

The scenes of Beethoven composing are the most memorable scenes in this movie for me -- he clearly has the great gift of being able to piece together all the musical forms in his head.  These scenes reminded me of ""Amadeus"" when Mozart was able to see how all the different parts of different instruments come together in his symphonic compositions.

Through these scenes we get to see how God chose to deposit his musical gifts in a very common and ordinary man who is full of shortcomings and weaknesses.

2) Ed Harris does a great job of capturing the divergent natures of Beethoven -- on one hand he is a musical genius, but on the other hand, he is quite a brute of a man.  On one hand, he could be gentle and tender, but on the other, he could suddenly become ""The BEAST"" -- be extremely cruel and harsh in his ridicule and mockery.  While Beethoven is busy composing a new musical work,  he could also be pouring water on his disheveled hair and drive his neighbors crazy with his utter disregard for their well-being as he ruins their dinner times.

3) The wonderful music in the film:  Not only do we get to hear the wonderful movements of the 9th Symphony, but we get to hear excerpts of the String Quartet and other works.  The movie could have done without ""Fur Elise"" (which is overplayed to death) -- we could have had more of some of his sonatas and chamber works.

4) The wonderful featurette ""Orchestrating Beethoven"" which offered great interviews of the director, script writers, and cast members.  It was very insightful.  The featurette and deleted scenes are great.

What I didn't like about the movie:

1) The over-emphasis on the importance of Anna Holtz to Beethoven.  Other reviewers have rightly criticized the movie as having too much of a feminist bent in this story of Beethoven.  As the featurette in the Special Features explain, the story of Anna Holtz as the gifted female compositional student is a work of fiction -- Anna Holtz is an example of artistic license on the part of screenwriters;  she is a composite of all the different assistants that helped Beethoven.

For dramatic effect and for creating a strong female character, the screenwriters created Anna Holtz to be the one assistant that comes to the aid of Beethoven in both his personal life and his compositional & musical efforts.  As Diane Kruger portrays her, Anna is attractive, intelligent, gifted, and perceptive.  She is everything that Schlemmer (Beethoven's aging male assistant) is not.  She is able to discern the thoughts and feelings of Beethoven -- she is the perfect assistant to help complete and ""correct"" Beethoven's compositions. At the climactic close, she is perfectly in sync with Beethoven as he conducts the 9th Symphony.  She is able to conduct just as Beethoven does.  In fact they become ""one"" in their conducting.

Historical and musical purists may be infuriated at these scenes.

2) It is highly doubtful that Beethoven conducted the 9th symphony with the help of a female assistant giving him the rhythmic cues.  Yet, this forms the climax of the movie.

All this aside, I felt that the movie was very worthwhile to watch.  It was a very moving and inspirational portrait of Beethoven.  In fact, I think it is the best portrayal of Beethoven for a feature film.  It is a much better film on Beethoven than ""Immortal Beloved"" (which I think was very chaotic and unorganized).

If you're a classical music lover and a Beethoven fan, this movie is well-worth watching.  I believe you'll be impressed by Harris' acting.",1176336000,86,4715,4.763255240443897
2750050,4,B000MV8AE0,"There are many things to be said in favor of director Agnieszka Holland's ('Europa, Europa', 'Total Eclipse', 'The Secret Garden', 'Olivier, Olivier') COPYING BEETHOVEN as written from fragments of questionable truths about the composer's final years by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson: the film is gorgeous to look at for all its candlelit sepia scenes and of course a pleasure to hear as the musical score is primarily excerpts of Beethoven's music, and for the towering performance of Ed Harris as the deaf, dirty, cruel, grumpy, gross Ludwig van Beethoven.  There have been sufficient biographies of the master to set the facts straight and this particular viewer has no problem at all with the tinkering of truth in creating a cinematic story that might help to explain the idiosyncrasies of the old master composers.  It is a movie to enjoy: it is not a true story for all its attempts to recreate the life of the composer.

In COPYING BEETHOVEN the premise is that the 'hard of hearing' Beethoven needs a copyist to help him complete his Symphony No. 9 due to a premiere of the work in four days time. Wenzel Schlemmer (Ralph Riach), Beethoven's usual copyist, is dying of cancer and arranges for the best pupil at the academy to assist Beethoven.  That pupil happens to be a female, one Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger), who arrives at Beethoven's filthy apartment and struggles to convince the composer that she is worthy of the task.  Anna is in love with a bridge builder Martin Bauer (Matthew Goode) and finds herself devoting her mind and attention to Beethoven rather than to Martin.  Beethoven has never married and instead is in love with his nephew Karl (Joe Anderson) who refuses to follow his uncle's footsteps and instead mistreats him by constantly begging/stealing money form him to pay his gambling debts.  So with this cast of characters Beethoven proceeds to complete his now famous 9th Symphony with Anna's help.  Beethoven is to conduct the premiere but must depend on Anna (substituting for the errant Karl) to sit in the orchestra and give him cues.  The performance is of course greeted with rapture, but Beethoven knows his output is not finished and the remainder of the film deals with his struggle to write the Grosse Fugue for his final string quartet, a piece the public (including Anna) loathes but one that Beethoven recognizes as the bridge to the next advance in music writing. Reduced to self pity, Beethoven dies, but Anna is going to carry the torch for her hero...

The problems with watching COPYING BEETHOVEN that will make those who know the facts of the composer's life stumble are many: Beethoven was completely deaf in his latter years, unable to hear his music much less conversations with people; Beethoven did not conduct the premiere of his 9th Symphony but instead sat deafly in the orchestra not even able to hear the score at which he stared; the gentility with which Ed Harris' Beethoven shows is in sharp contrast to the rascally and despicable behavior of the real man.  But those facts don't lend themselves to a good story for cinema and the writers and director were wise to realize this.  So forgive the straying from the truth and settle back for a very entertaining if factually irresponsible 'biography'. The musical portions of the film are so truncated that the music suffers, but that matters little to the impression Beethoven's 9th, even in soundbites, has on audiences.  If for no other reason, see this film for the bravura performance by Ed Harris.  Grady Harp, April 07",1175731200,7,3550,4.865671641791045
2750051,4,B000MV8AE0,"In October of 1955, Charles Schulz did a series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peanuts/dp/1560976470/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Peanuts""</a>&nbsp;strips dealing with Schroeder and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven-s-9th-Symphony/dp/B000065UNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven's 9th Symphony</a>.  Schroeder listens to it in an overcoat because the first movement was so beautiful it gave him chills.  The October 27th strip has Charlie Brown reading to Schroeder how: ""At the conclusion of the symphony the audience stood up and cheered.  Beethoven, however, because of his deafness could not hear them, and because his back was to the audience could not see them.  With Tears in her eyes one of the singers led Beethoven to the edge of the stage where he could see the cheering people.""  At this point Schroeder buries his face in his hands and emits a heartbroken ""SOB.""

There are many stories about that first performance, and while no one knows for sure what has the most credence is that Beethoven wanted to conduct his work, but his deafness made it impossible, so Michael Umlauf, the Kapellmeister of the K&auml;rntnertortheater in Vienna conducted the orchestera.  Beethoven was behind him on the stage, giving the tempos at the beginning of each movement and beating the time.  The orchestra had been instructed to ignore the composer and when the symphony was over Beethoven was still beating time and turning pages of the score.  That was when the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to see the cheering audience, who were raising their hands and throwing things into the air to make up for the fact the man they were cheering could not hear their ovation.

""Copying Beethoven"" looks at the last years of the life of Ludwig van Beethoven (Ed Harris) and writers Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson, who did the screenplays for the biopics of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ali/dp/B0001XAOL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Ali""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nixon/dp/B000063V8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Nixon""</a>&nbsp;(and are currently working on a film about Jackie Robinson), create the fictional character of Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger), a young woman who is sent to the apartment of the maestro to turn his original pages for the score of the 9th Symphony into something that can actually be read and printed for the orchestra.  At the premier performance of the work the composer will indeed conduct the work himself, but with Anna working as his ears to give him the proper tempos, and it will be Anna who will turn Beethoven around so that he can see the applause.

What will surprise you is that this film's interpretation of this memorable moment comes not at the end of ""Copying Beethoven,"" but about an hour into this 2006 film.  It is the highpoint of the film and then the story continues for another half hour, with decidedly less impressive results.  My favorite scene actually comes early in the film, when Anna is trying to explain that she is indeed the copyist who has been sent to turn his original pages for the score of the 9th Symphony into something that can actually be read and printed for the orchestra.  It is in its own small wall the counterpart to the scene at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amadeus/dp/6304712936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Amadeus""</a>&nbsp;when Mozart is explaining to Saliari how the pieces of ""De Profundus"" fit together in his ""Mass.""  Beethoven finds an ""error,"" and in her explanation we have our proof that Anna knows what she is doing and a glimpse into the technical nature of Beethoven's genius.  But far too often director Agnieszka Holland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europa-Europa/dp/B00007KQ9X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Europa Europa""</a>) focuses on Anna instead of the maestro.

Ultimately, ""Copying Beethoven"" is too caught up in the character of Anna.  What could have been a nice conceit, giving the maestro someone to talk to about living with deafness and to articulate what he was doing to change the world of music, is turned into a proto-feminist figure who wants to make her own mark as a composer.  As he turned deaf Beethoven started keeping conversation diaries, a rich source of the composer's thoughts regarding his music, so there are original source material to be mined for gems similar to what we get a glimpse of early in the film.  Instead, we waste time on Anna's struggle to write music, a plotline that really has no where to go and which ends up being enveloped in the idea that the Beethoven's last works so radical and so far ahead of their time that they could not be comprehended by the audiences of the Romantic Ear.

I have to say that the actual performance of the 9th is far too short for my taste and the emphasis becomes not so much the music as it is the place where it takes both Beethoven and Anna (ironically, while he is conducting without ears as it were, she keeps closing her eyes as she becomes enraptured).  There is a problem in that the way the situation is set up you are inclined to think that they are skating on the edge of disaster and that either one of them could make a horrible mistake.  This tends to take away from the music and at least there are a few shots of members of the audience moved by the realization that this deaf old man, who had not premiered a symphony for a dozen years, was unleashing a work of monumental greatness.

""Copying Beethoven"" also suffers in comparison to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal-Beloved/dp/B00000K3TN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Immortal Beloved""</a>, the 1994 film about the composer that had the virtue of framing Beethoven's life in the quest to uncover the mystery woman in his life.  But watching Harris play Beethoven conducting his symphony is pretty captivating and throughout this movie there is always Beethoven's music, so there is ample grounds to round up on this film.  Finally, if the main effect of this film is that you go out and listen to the 9th Symphony from start to finish, which is exactly what I did, then you would be ahead of the game.",1175644800,106,6429,5.507113821138211
2750052,3,B000MV8AE0,"I'm not as overwhelmed as the last reviewer.  The movie is visually very pleasing, and of course the music is wonderful, but the characters and their situations are terribly cliche'd, and the script pretty clunky and wooden in places.  Basically, this is just an old-time Hollywood biopic with a touch of social comment (the role of women) and discussion of the nature of Art thrown in.  Diane Kruger is curiously lukewarm and not entirely convincing, but Ed Harris does a good job, and despite my reservations this is certainly a movie worth watching.",1175126400,41,552,4.913978494623656

No one does a grousing artist genius better than Ed Harris, and he does it here as Maestro Beethoven-- crude, vulgar, gifted beyond imagining. Diane Kruger is impressive as Anna Holtz, the refined, devoted, though often repelled by his behavior, composition student, now transcriber for the almost completely deaf composer. From early contempt for the woman copyist, he comes to value and rely on her judgement in both matters personal and musical. The script is often almost poetic, lyrical; not in a sappy way, transcendent. Beethoven's richly powerful music certainly is transportive.  All disciplines unite and  excel in this exciting seamless production.

2750110,3,B000MV8AE0,"One could rate this outlier of a movie anywhere from one to four stars....my critical compass is still fluctuating.

On the one hand, it attempts to deal with some of the genuine creative issues in Beethoven's career, most tellingly perhaps the transition, at his life's end, into his ""late"" style, still a puzzlement to many listeners (and OK, let's be honest, how many of us want to stream the Grosse Fugue after a hard day at the office?). So yes, it does attempt to grapple with some real, deep matters.

On the other hand, the actual story is wildly implausible and just plain silly at times. Beethoven never had a pretty young assistant to help copy his music (would that he had, the poor bloke!), and she would never, ever, have ""corrected"" the score to the Ninth Symphony as shown early in the film. The other impossibilities/contradictions of reality are too numerous to mention for this writer on a Saturday morning.

I liked the photography and Ms. Holland's editing/pacing style (reminded me of the excellent episode #1 of ""Treme"" that she directed). Much of the film is shot in closeup, like a made-for-TV movie. The scene where the pretty assistant washes Beethoven's semi-nude body, with its ambivalent and unresolved sexual overtones, evokes the Pieta of Michelangelo, and remains in the memory.

His masterpiece was ""Enemy at the Gates"" in my opinion.  Then I saw this show, and now I ain't so sure.  In this movie, he BECOMES the character in the way that you want to believe is a honest interpretation of what the genius was really like in real life.  There is no videos of the man, of course, but artists of that caliber always seem to be eccentric individuals with little patience for mortals in daily life. Ed Harris NAILS the role, and his talents perfectly suit the role as well.

I ain't got no classical records at my house.  I am afraid of it because I fear that I will like it too much.  You hear bits of it at church, etc.; but it wasn't ever ""cool"" among my peers in the early years.  But these days, more and more guys I know secretly have some Bach, Tchaikovsky, and other similar type CD's up underneath their other records.  I guess they are starting to want a change from the Allmans, Eric, Elton, and Dolly.

Anyway, this movie is GOOD!  It is not a documentary, or biography; it is a very watchable, interesting story that is set in what a 19th century Vienna probably was.  It has a very good cast that supports Harris very well.  The second leading character is a lady that I had not seen before, but was VERY familiar to me.  I convinced myself that it was that lady that starred in the TV show ""The Medium"" (Courtney Cox's sister-in-law), but my wife said it was not her.  In any case, she provides a strong performance that rivals Harris's star power portrayal.  A well-paced movie, never ""dragging"" and gets more, and more interesting with every few minutes.

The music, the ""Ninth Symphony"" which has a significant part of it played in the movie is stunning beyond belief!  In surround sound; this music is powerful, ...overwhelming!  You completely ""lose"" yourself for a minute, or so.  It is that emotional, or ""fulfilling(?).""  I don't know if all classical music is like that song, but I would rate that tune up above ""Stairway"", or even ""Sweet Home Alabama""!!  It is that good.

This movie is one of those shows that ""grips"" you to where you just sit and stare at the credits at the end, not wanting the show, or score to end.  You want to immediately start the DVD over, and watch it again.",1405296000,2,2379,4.376712328767123

2750121,1,B000MV8AE0,"As the old bromide goes allegedly behind ever great man is a great woman.  That is an arguably true assessment in a huge number of instances.  What is totally true is that BEFORE every great man there came a great woman - namely, the great man's mom. The trouble is that in a film like the one under discussion here, the great woman is a complete fairy tale.  There never was such a woman as Anna Holz in Beethoven's life.  She is a feminist fantasy brought to absurd life on the silver screen.  And why?  Isn't Beethoven's life exciting enough that such an embellishment would not be necessitated in a film adaptation?  Well, Diane Kruger, the actress playing Anna, hints at the reason in her comments in the Featurette: it seems the fictitious femme was scripted in so as to make Beethoven's tale more accessible to younger audiences.  So what happens then?  Young folks not familiar with the great man's life exit the theaters thinking amongst many other erroneous things that the Ninth's premiere would have been a disaster if NOT for Anna's assistance!  They even come away thinking she as not only a copyist for Ludwig Van but a co-composer with him as well!  How many uninformed viewers would afterward take the time to find out the facts away from the film?  A very small percentage probably.  And so the liberal lie becomes slowly but surely the new truth - and history is driven yet further from the actual to the absurd.  Of course, Hollywood has been doing this since the Silents.  But it doesn't make it right.  Especially in a day and age when fewer and fewer people are reading anything worthwhile! When passing something down to the next generation, why stoop to the level of the recipient?  Better far to have the newbies reach to take the torch...for in reaching one truly grows and attains new heights.  So, for example, instead of having today's youth develop an artistic appreciation of black and white movies, heck, remake them!  In color!  In 3-D!  Hitch's PSYCHO comes to mind, the abysmal remake of it.  Studio thinking was that kids wouldn't watch the black and white original - even though it is a complete masterpiece!  So, instead, Hollywood stooped and re-shot the classic so as to hope young filmgoers might flock to it.  With COPYING BEETHOVEN, the true story isn't a good enough hook, so throw a headstrong lady into the mix and then maybe the film will draw the biggest ticket buyers in the country!

The movie should have really been titled ANNA HOLZ given that she is the centerpiece of the film.  But, of course, many more tickets are sold if a movie has a recognizable name in its title.  Would as many people have shelled out to see the dog movies if the dog wasn't named BEETHOVEN?  And so it is with this film. Use Beethoven to make a politically correct feminist statement about the role of women in the world of early 19th century Vienna.  Truth?  Who cares! Bring in the young ones!  Lure them in with lies!  Make everybody happy - even if depicting things that never happened!  Such as the hilarious sequence wherein Anna secretly conducts the Ninth.  I haven't seen such a pathetically ridiculous scene in a movie in some time.  Throughout the whole movie Anna reminded me of Rose in TITANIC.  Rose knew more about the ship than anyone else on board!  She learned how to spit like a man, wield an axe like a man, knew Picasso would go far, knew there weren't enough lifeboats long before the berg made its bow by colliding with the actual bow - the only thing she didn't know was how to edge over a bit on her floating furniture and let poor, freezing, love-of-her-life Jack Dawson escape the icy grip of death!  But...that is another movie.  Both women, however, share similar genes.  And how telling that both women were concocted by male screenwriters.

Ed Harris, who plays Beethoven not too shabbily, hints somewhat in his commentary that Anna Holtz might just be a figment of the composer's imagination.  Perhaps she is his Muse. This would have worked far better than the film's presentation of her as flesh-and-blood fact. Anyway, apart from Anna's annoying screen existence, the movie is also burdened with three distinct scenes that parrot like scenes in AMADEUS, and this ""copying"" seems less flattery and more falseness.  Karl, Beethoven's nephew, is introduced but goes nowhere.  Anna's boyfriend Martin comes across as fictitious as does she - and the scene wherein Beethoven demolishes the model of Martin's bridge seems unduly crafty and cinematic.  The best things in the movie are the music (of course!), the sets, the costumes, the decor, a few scenes of Beethoven walking in the city and country - too bad the movie itself was not as accurate as all the rest of it.

Two questions: in the final scene, where is Anna going?  And why - on the cover of the DVD - does Ed Harris as Beethoven look more like Sting than either Ed Harris or Beethoven or Ed Harris as Beethoven?  Well, I guess looking like Sting is better than Gary Oldman as Beethoven looking more like Bill Maher as...well, Bill Maher on the DVD cover of the vastly superior Ludwig Van film IMMORTAL BELOVED.",1390348800,6,5135,4.672240802675585

2750133,4,B000MV8AE0,"Hollywood often operates in pairs. Sometimes, it happens that two movies are released at substantially the same time, with the same subject matters, with only one inevitably overtaking the other, either in quality or popularity. For example: ""The Player"" and ""The Mistress."" Both are movies about making movies, but the former the one most remembered. The Mistress is  arguably more edgier, and arguably a better reflection of the clash of egos involved in getting a movie financed, not to mention even made, but The Player is more remembered because it was considered the come-back movie of a respected director, Robert Altman.
Another good example are ""Nowhere Boy"" and ""Backbeat,"" two movies about the beginnings of the Beatles, both released about the same time. It seems Hollywood has trouble coming up with new ideas.

So it is with this movie, ""Copying Beethoven."" This movie was released at about the same time as ""Immortal Beloved,"" another movie about Beethoven, starring Gary Oldman in the title role. Is this any less of a movie? The approaches of the actors playing the title role are different. Oldman's portrayal is more impassioned, while Harris brilliantly conveys Beethoven's temper. There is nothing deficient in Harris' portrayal, but the movie suffers from a directorial approach which detracts the movie watcher's attention from the drama in Beethoven's life and could perhaps do with a better script. The music is there -- how could it not be? -- but the various subplots is confusing and distracting. At times, when watching Harris fly into one of the temper tantrums Beethoven was so famous for, one can't help but wonder what was in Harris' mind. He was probably thinking, ""Why couldn't they come up with a decent script?""

Beethoven wasn't just about temper tantrums, but had a life full of drama, remorse, and tragedy. It says a lot about Oldman's craft that he could portray these moods in a convincing way, such that even though he does not look like Beethoven, he IS Beethoven. While there is a superficial resemblance to the real person, no amount of make-up would make Harris' portrayal convincing because the script is too one-dimensional and the direction too confused.

This is not a recommendation not to purchase this movie. If you have Immortal Beloved, buy this version of Beethoven's life to make your own comparison.",1350259200,2,2358,5.053984575835476
2750134,4,B000MV8AE0,"Because the rest of this review may contain a mix of spoilers and mood killers, my conclusion and recommendation will come first.

This rates four stars, because it would be a lie if I did not admit that during most of the movie I was having a great time.
The music alone is worth your time. The acting is very good throughout. The sets nicely done even if the costuming is somewhat under done. Most of the characters would not have been able to afford the opulence for which this era was famous so this is a minor point. The final recommendation from me is: Rent it, or instant view it once. It is worth one viewing. It is not something you must have at the ready for re-play.

Ed Harris is a commanding high energy Beethoven. The directing and writing also has him portray a crude, bore and a sincerely passionate artist. I keep thinking he was Jack Palance, perhaps the two were separated at birth. Diane Kruger as the fictional Anna Holtz manages to handle simpering idol worshiping girl and independent modern professional woman - both convincing.

Briefly the movie is a memory flash back from Anna Holtz's point of view. She pushes herself into the great composer's life four days before the premier of the great Ninth Symphony. The crises is/are that he has not finished drafting the composition and he needs a copiest who can transcribe a clean draft and forward it to the music house that will make the hundreds of copies and individual arrangements for the musicians and chorus.  He is almost totally deaf, cantankerous and she is a nascent composer. He sees the artist in her and she earns enough of his respect that they form a
professional relationship. There may be a romance between them but we cannot be sure and if so that romance is not a plot driver.

Here begin the problems.

The movie opens with an overly long carriage ride . We see too many dirty faced sincere peasants doing honest field work, some shot in scenes reminiscent of old Dutch master paintings. Anna Holtz is a highly distressed passenger apparently hearing a small violin group playing music at once familiar and some how not right. The cause of her distress is that she is frantic to get back to Vienna to be at the side of a dying Beethoven.

Exactly why we have so many views of dirty faced peasants is unclear. We will never see any of them again nor is there any later reference to them nor are they of any meaning to the plot.
From here on the questions keep piling up:
Why is Beethoven's nephew in the movie? His stealing is fobbed off by his doting uncle. The young man's impending, forced recital is a topic of much discussion and film time, then he and the recital disappear. OK he gets to come back and cry. So what?
Why is so much time spent on Anna Holtz's boyfriend (lover? fiancee?)? He is an engineer/designer, but once he has his run in with the Maestro we never see or hear from him again. Did he benefit by the meeting? Does he give up bridge design? Was his career forever blighted? In his make out scene, what are we to conclude when his embrace of Anna Holtz is so passionate they both go to their knees? Does she return to the Convent of the Sacred Heart with Parquet burns? Why is this character even in the movie? Except, maybe he is set up for Anna to deliver the single best line of the movie.
Did they call it ""mooning"" in the 1830's?
What are we supposed to make of the sponge bath scene?
Can you debut 2 hours of symphony with chorus. if all of the musicians and singers have never successfully rehearsed together?
In the aural ""sex"" scene,- if it was just about the music, why the lingering shot of her decollete? - Is it an accident that she is basically on her knees sharing the passion of the music with the deaf conductor? Beautiful music, mostly well edited together, but why the spinning camera, unless this is a symphonic orgasm, er crescendo....
Early on she proves that she understands the musical soul of Beethoven, then is crushed when he is unimpressed with her composition:  da dee dah deettle dettle dah dah Rococo skimpy tune -  this likely to impress Beethoven?

I have more unanswered questions. This move has more gaps, clutter and distracting business than bad, over written science fiction space opera. A movie that make of you a whiner is not one you need to own.",1341532800,2,4304,4.4853128991060025
2750135,2,B000MV8AE0,"I saw this movie on a TV station that interrupted, sometimes mid-scene, cutting hard from movie to commercial. And the frequency and length of commercial units was extremely distracting. They also included factoids about Beethoven on a 3rd-grade level.

The much vaunted Beethoven's Ninth segment was destroyed by the vicious insipid cuts of the music. Ouch and ouch.

The story is of course total fiction, which is not in itself a criticism, but had tender moments, though it was often just dopey. Beethoven is presented in a way that was actionable. And his quotable quotes were nonsense.

However if you love Beethoven and are interested, you can at least see how he dressed, where he might have walked, how lighting and transportation were handled and to a lesser extent, ablution. Those are why I watched. The actress is adorable. Ed Harris' Beethoven is, dunno, I did not buy it--not his best work but not awful either.

2750137,2,B000MV8AE0,"Ok, so why fictionalize an account of Beethoven's last days when the facts are well known? In a word: pandering. From Hollywood's standpoint, the audience for a period drama is mostly female, so in order for the film to have a chance at success, it needs a strong female character at the center. Thus, the two male copyists whom worked with Beethoven on the Ninth Symphony are replaced with the fictional, headstrong proto-feminist Anna, who of course faces sexist opposition from the mostly cardboard male characters around her. It's a tired old motif that has been employed many times before, but what's particularly egregious in this case is that it's essentially made-up 'history'. There's no statement anywhere on the film that I could see which indicated that certain facts or characters had been deliberately fabricated, and since few people will take the time to verify the accuracy of the story, what we end up with is a piece of revisionist history, eagerly swallowed by hopeful females who would like to think that Beethoven had a secret 'ghostwriter' of sorts in Anna.

Think I'm paranoid? Well I was coerced into watching this film just last night by my wife and mother-in-law - I agreed, even though I already knew it was fake. The two immediately were drawn into the story (one saving grace is that the acting is good) and soon were remaking on the proceedings as if they were being presented with a factual account. I gently reminded them to or three times that the Beethoven/Anna relationship was a complete fabrication, but it did not matter, they were becoming believers! My wife shot back, ""It *could* have happened!"" Yeah, and Hitler could have secretly been Jewish!

There's been several of these revisionist-history type films lately, and not all with a feminist agenda either. ""The Inglorious Bastards"" and ""Anonymous"" are two recent ones. I'm really sorry that the facts of history don't align with people's particular political agendas, but this crap has got to stop - the facts are the facts, people.

2750138,5,B000MV8AE0,"""Copying Beethoven"" is a must have movie for any serious (or even casual) fan of classical music. It deals with Beethoven as he is finishing up writing his 9th symphony and preparing for its debut preformance. Ed Harris is given the roll of playing Beethoven. Having to play such a larger then life role as Beethoven must be a challenge for any actor but if it is Harris is up to it. His performance in this film is one of his best in his acting career. Diane Kruger plays Anna, a young lady who applies for the job as Beethovens' copiest. She is interested in a career in music and working for the great mestro would be a hugh plus for her to learn about composing music. Beethoven is at first opposed to such an idea as having a woman as a copiest but soons relents when he sees she has a true love for music and knows what she is doing. Soon the great Ludwig comes dependant on her and values her judgement and friendship. Whether or not Diane Krugers' character really existed in real life is unsure but Beethovens' depiction in the movie at this point in his life is pretty much accurate. Agnieszka Holland is the director of this film and the time and effort she put in to creating 18th century Vienna is masterful. The true moment of beauty in the film is her brilliant creation of the concert hall and performance of the premier of the 9th symphony. This film I think could go on to become known as Hollands' masterpiece in her career.",1317686400,,1443,4.368029739776952

* Depicting Beethoven as a brute. Beethoven certainly had a strong personality. He refused to be treated as a servant and therefore did not adhere to the mores of the time which expected musicians to have their meals with servants or to enter homes through the back door. He also suffered from constant stomach complaints and pain, apart from the distress of losing his hearing. He had a difficult childhood and family problems. He did not find lasting love. All these issues had some influence on his personality. But he behaved according to the norms of civility of the time. He would never have reacted as shown in this biopic (shattering a bridge model or ""mooning"")

* The character of the female copyist is completely fictional. There was no female copyist, let alone one who would alter Beethoven's scores, or who would be treated in such a way by the composer.

Films are works of art in their own right and, true, they may not adhere to reality. But when the name of a great man is used to lure audiencies to the cinemas, a depiction of real events is to be expected.

This movie was targeted at the Oprah crowd, for whom women have been always oppressed, mushy banalities count as deep thoughts, self-indulgent narcissistic artists are more essential than the bores who design bridges and build computer networks, and greatness (however defined) trumps all other scales. (See: Polanski, Roman)

No, I laughed when Ana and Louie locked eyes during the ludicrous conducting. She was wagging her arm as if she were saying ""Bye-bye"" to a reluctant four year old going to a party. This was just silly. And interminable. I laughed when the deaf maestro could hear her soft spoken words but couldn't hear thundering applause. I laughed when Anna walked off into the field at the end. I felt sure that she was going to be wearing a habit at the end of the film; how else to explain that no one has heard of her? But their ending was even sillier.

For all his blustering and out of control behaviors, there is nowhere in this film that Ed and Ludwig actually merge. Instead, what we do get is a full repetoire of Beethoven's reported excentricities and nothing of the man himself.
Music history buffs will wince at the banality of both the story and the performances.  Beethoven isn't easily depicted in only an hour and a half, or however long this thing takes.  He was a visionary, a genuis of the first order, who restructured how music would be written for the next 50 years after him (until the loathful Wagner came along and, coincidentially, wrote some of the most beautiful music, while being one of the most reprehensible of men).
Beethoven revolutionalized not only the music world, but how composers -- at least himself -- should be treated in social situations.  No longer would he enter through the side or back door reserved for tradesmen, and he refused to eat in the kitchen with the rest of the servants.  Beethoven either sat at the table with the host and the other guests, or he didn't show up! And he came in through the front door!
Beethoven has his own place in music history -- no one composing in his era even came close.  It's disappointing that the people responsible for this debacle served him so ill.
I join a growing number of people wondering when we're finally going to get a
fine Beethoven film with a subperb actor at the helm!
This is an AMADEUS-wannabe ... with none of the wit, charm, or attention to detail AMADEUS gave us.  What made that film truly remarkable was the breadth of Mozart's music the Neville Marriner and the Orchestra and Chorus of St. Martin-in-the-Field carefully selected to give us an overview of Mozart's genuis.
The only similarity between AMADEUS and COPYING BEETHOVEN is that the former
was original and worked well, while the latter tried to copy elements of AMADEUS and never succeeded.  This is a frustrating film; one of the pie-in-the-sky variety thrown together, slap, dash, which wastes everyone's time.",1250467200,7,2181,4.723684210526316

Yet her performance is not entirely convincing.  It lacks passion.  It even seems bland at times.  I'm not familiar with any other of Krugers' work, but at best, she's a pretty girl who can read her lines.  That's all it takes in Hollywood, right?

These persons usually have complex, nuanced personalities, and lead interesting lives (well, there are exceptions, see Rossini). Beethoven is exhibit A. So the subject should be an easy one to make a great movie out of.

However, this particular movie disappoints greatly, I am sorry to say. Its nonfictional elements are historically inaccurate, the dialogue is sometimes silly, and the movie lacks a plot. Where is the plot? Granted, we may have no right to expect a plot of the caliber of the ""Amadeus"" plot  (which was conceived in the 19th century by Alexander Pushkin, one of the great geniuses of Romantic literature). But this movie lacks any credible plot. As for historical inaccuracy, and also utter silliness, see for example the scene where the ""Moonlight"" sonata is mentioned. In fact, the sonata was not called ""Moonlight"" until after Beethoven's death. It also may have not occurred to the writers of this film that the expression ""mooning someone"" may not have existed in 19th-century German.

""Immortal Beloved"",  while no ""Amadeus,"" is a movie with a credible plot and much less insulting to the viewers and to the composer than ""Copying Beethoven."" I would recommend it.",1229904000,5,1259,5.067632850241546
2750158,5,B000MV8AE0,"This film truly defines quality melodrama (the promoters call it ""drama"")... the emotions of the principals herein are somewhat exaggerated and a superb soundtrack punctuates the action. The various scenes flow right along and are neither hokey, nor boring, nor lethargic.

Here we are transported to 1825 Vienna, Austria near the end of Beethoven's life. There is not much argument against Beethoven being the greatest classical music composer of all time and his groundbreaking Magnum opus, Symphony No. 9 (""Choral"") serves as the focal point of the film. It's also significant to know that Beethoven was deaf, pretty much subsequent to the composition of his 5th Symphony.

A fact of which most casual Beethoven listeners are unaware is that the old maestro could be a brutal megalomaniac just short in increment of Richard Wagner's infamous personality. But at times Beethoven could also assert compassion, especially toward his closest relative, a ne'er-do-well nephew.

The story here is about a young music student, Anna Holz (superbly played by Diane Kruger), who is tasked to hurriedly copy the score of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the premire of which is slated for just a few days away. She ""corrects"" Beethoven's scrawl (Beethoven is played quite effectively by Ed Harris) in one critical spot and this incomprehensible but courageous act brings the two of them together into a ""partnership"" rather than as employer-employee.

Beethoven insists on conducting the 9th and, in a near panic, on the night of the concert he enlists Anna to conduct in the pit just below him so that he doesn't throw the orchestra off into chaos. One of the finest facets of the movie is the shrewdly abridged version of the 9th Symphony being conducted by Beethoven (and by Anna). The interaction between Anna and Beethoven presents a roller coaster ride that the viewer will not soon forget.

I'm not a huge fan of contemporary film -- rare exceptions include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village-Widescreen-Vista-Series/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gosford-Park/dp/B00005JKNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gosford Park</a>. But in this instance I have found yet another exception -- this is a terrifically entertaining film from start to finish. And of course the filmscore is spectacular as well, particularly for Beethoven fans. I do wish that I had viewed the movie in widescreen but this is the hazard of borrowing DVDs from the public library -- they tend to always be in full-screen.

The film is not entirely flawless in that it's hardly a work for the edification of prospective Beethoven scholars. For example, Beethoven at one point states his guess that Anna's favorite of all his works is the ""Moonlight Sonata"" (Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor ""Quasi una fantasia"", Op. 27, No. 2, composed in 1801.) This unfortunate comment is an anachronism as this renowned work wasn't dubbed the ""Moonlight Sonata"" until 1832, when music critic Ludwig Rellstab compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne. The point is that this nickname did not evolve until five years subsequent to Beethoven's death in 1827.

Still, I'm okay with the invocation of poetic license on the part of directors of biographical films as long as it's not something in gross conflict with the life of their selected subject. In this case, the movie was wonderfully directed by Agnieszka Holland.

The attempt to make the orchestra conducting interplay between Beethoven and his female protege come off as a sensual act was obvious, but for me did not work and was dumb, dumb, dumb, dummmmb.
  ""Copying Beethoven"" plays almost like a low-budget teleplay. The acting is passable, but not especially engrossing. I never really cared for any of the characters very much. The dialogue was mostly trite and contrived. The visuals were for the part not particularly interesting.  In all the film looked like it was basically slapped together in a rush. I was actually tempted to turn the movie off several times, but persisted to see it out to its ending. The viewing experience left me unsatisfied and disappointed.
  I think the film could have worked if it had been presented as a comedy.  There were many elements of potential humor in the presentation.
Some attempt was made to use the humorous aspects to lighten the story, but I think it would have been better to exploit this humor.

Anna enters the scene as an eager student, the best of her composition intructor's recent crop. Her job, as copyist, is to take the maestro's rough notes (musical nots, in this case), and transcribe them into final form. In this story, she's no mere scribe, but Beethoven's partner and intellectual soul-mate. You could call this a romance story of the most chaste and intellectual kind, but intimate nonetheless.

Beethoven comes across as fiercely driven, fiercely egotistical, and just plain fierce. Holtz's delicate beauty tames that ""beast"", as he was termed early on. That feat came about more through her own strength and artistic skill than through her comeliness, though. I enjoyed seeing the fictional Holtz in a strong role, as improbable as it might historically have been. If you don't mind Beethoven the man being co-opted into a fictional setting that rewrites a few of his historical facts, this movie offers plenty to enjoy.

And I probably will catch heck for this, but although Ed Harris is an accomplished and talented actor, I feel that he is miscast here.  Ok, maybe I'm biased towards Gary Oldman and I imagine that the director, Agnieszka Holland, probably considered casting Oldman and then second-guessed herself.  But Oldman really ""got"" Beethoven. I was just more aware of watching Ed Harris, the actor, than really tuning in to Beethoven, the man.  Diane Kruger, on the other hand, really steals the film.  She is perfectly beguiling and beautiful as the 23 year old Viennese music student, Anna Holz.  The film does have several beautiful moments of convergence such as when Beethoven begs forgiveness from Miss Holz because he has insulted her music, or when he is describing to her the ""silence in between the notes"", (who better to know this silence than the deaf Beethoven), and that this is our only true connection to God and thus, the inspiration for music (only his is the greatest music!). The scene with Beethoven, Anna and Anna's beau is both riveting and brilliant. I fear that a newcomer to classical music may not be as inspired as I was, given the film's overly-brooding tone, dark photography, and sense of trying just a bit too hard to impress.

 It's hard to imagine what a composer's personality is like after a few hundred years so. Unless we look at his music, analyze it and assume that he wrote to portray his emotions. As far as the historical accuracy of this film I am not quite sure if it is accurate. The relationship between a copyist and the composer himself seems possible. I can just imagine how crazy Beethoven can get. There were some terms that were used that I didn't think they used in the 19th Century, some of them were crude. But if someone were to watch it and not have any knowledge of Beethoven they might find it a cute film with not a whole lot of entertainment value, in my opinion. The whole story seemed like it just wanted to show that women didn't have any rights with the men. I guess someone could see it as that type of film. There were some redeeming factors like when Beethoven destroyed the bridge, I laughed a bit.
 When Beethoven had the opportunity to critique the copyist's piece, he was completely insensitive and mocked her work. He didn't realize it at the time but it really hurt her. But it was obvious how much he changed from their relationship, before her he would have not cared and let them run away. But once he realized what he did he ran back to her and promptly apologized.  At this point I was wondering what was the actual plot line because It didn't seem to follow a single line. Just a lot of little plot lines.
 Beethoven spoke of himself as Gods messenger and Anna was his mouthpiece. His music was as if God was speaking to the people, telling them of his love for them, the gifts he has given them, and giving them hope in a world that speaks of hopelessness.

Any musician that is reading this will bear witness to this.

Beethoven was not without his faults. But his music was as powerful as life itself. And he continued to progress in his musical development until the day he died. The movie shows how he pushed the envelope with his Concerto Grosso; and nobody understood what he was doing. Until many years after he died. Now, it is how we hear music.

Both movies cover Beethoven's triumph of the premiere of his 9th symphony.  This film, however, goes beyond the 9th and focuses on this late string quartets - most of which were rejected by the musical audience of his day.

Diane Kruger portrays a fictional character who interacts with Ludwig.  She is his musical copyist who has ambitions to write music in her own right.  While she is technically gifted in music theory and being a copyist, she is missing the Master's innovative touch when it comes to composition.

The relationship between the two becomes the center-of-gravity of the film.  Somewhat surprisingly, the movie does not water itself down to becoming some cheesy love story.  Granted, there are a few moments in the film that could be called erotic in nature, but it is a very muted eroticism.

Instead of Salieri being buried in the shadow of Mozart, Beethoven belittles a person who belongs to another art:  architecture.  In this case, Beethoven points out that the guy is a not-so-good bridge builder.  That was a curious segment.

Ed Harris is every bit as obnoxious, pompous, volatile, ill-mannered, rude and bigger-than-life as we would expect from someone playing the Great Composer.  I have always been a big fan of Ed Harris, and this movie is likely to convert others to admiring Harris' acting prowess as well.  In the special features, Harris reveals that he read up on Beethoven's life and constanly listened to his music in preparation for the role.  It shows!  Diane Kruger is terrific as the young woman who gains Beethoven's friendship.  The fact that she was born in Germany adds to the lustre of the film.

What a pleasant surprise.  This is an ""alternate reality"" version of Beethoven, including people that might have existed -- should have existed -- but didn't.

It is not history.  It is more like a song about history.

Beautiful music, beautiful ideas, and beautiful people.  If you are worried about historical accuracy you should avoid it.  If you approach it as a ""might-have-been"" history you will love it.",1187481600,4,486,4.7023809523809526
2750181,3,B000MV8AE0,"I could not give any movie using so much of Beethoven's music less than three stars. Ed Harris does a good job as Beethoven, but the movie focuses way too much time on a fictional character Anna Holtz. She's trying to become a composer. She must fight against everyone's opinion, including Beethoven's, that women can't compose. Beethoven is quickly won over. (There is a funny scene where Beethoven is punctuating his musical  reading of Anna's composition with raspberries, which mimics a scene in Amadeus) She's in love with an engineer, Beethoven thinks anything or anyone which deal with a slide rule can have no soul. Is Anna going to dump the engineer? The movie could could give us a fasincating story on the real Beethoven, but we spend most of time learning about travails of a fictional Anna.

The climax of the movie happens while Anna is helping Ludwig conduct the first performance of the Ninth Symphony. He is taking cues from her on the beat and helping the performers to come in. They cut out way too much of the Ninth, but that is a side point. We watch him watch her be transfigured by the music. It is a good way to express the power of the Ninth. Unfortunately she loses the beat sometimes. So it is a technique that only partially works. The movie also shows Beethoven's estranged nephew Karl's reaction to the Ninth, which helped with displaying the power of the performance of the Ninth.

The movie sort of drifts after the performance of the Ninth. The audience hears snippets of the Grosse Fugue and some other pieces, but not enough. The movie delves slightly into the nature of creativity. What is and is not art, but not very well. There is a good line from Beethoven yelling that music is the language of God and that God screams into his ears and that why he is deaf. There is some other mumble jumble about composing music and religion. I am not sure whether the movie is quoting Beethoven or not.

The movie was enjoyable because of the soundtrack. I put it on the same level as ""Immortal Beloved."" Beloved is more flamboyant and Copying has Ed Harris going for it. My recommendation is to skip those movies and go buy a CD of the Ninth.",1186790400,7,2170,4.556410256410256
2750182,5,B000MV8AE0,"Ed Harris creates a convincing Beethoven. ( Immortal Beloved committed  crass nonsense  identifying Beethoven's widowed sister-in-law as his beloved.. No historian of standing would try that.)  Composers had copyists. The female copyist in Copying Beethoven is gentle and delightful fictionalizing.  At the real premier of the 9th Symphony Beethoven had an assistant conductor who turned him around to see the ovation at the end.  That passage was done perfectly in this film, it was deeply moving.  Diane Kreuger  does the alchemy of hero-worshiping empathy and self-asserting spunk beautifully. There she speaks for all of us  who love the difficult man as well as his music.  In May I visited Beethove's apartments in Vienna, the Pasqualatie house, and in Heilingenstadt.

In several leading biographies, including Thayer and Maynard Solomon,  I have never read that Beethoven smashed a young engineer's bridge model.  His roughness could have been shown by his berating the engineer loudly, disturbing the meeting, and raising his cane threatening to smash the model, but not going that far. If he was trying to teach the engineer a lesson in self-criticism, that would have been enough. Any notion that Beethoven was jealously  striking at Anna Holst's friend is ludicrous.

Those moments in the film when Beethoven explains his music to Anna Holst allude to how Beethoven 's genius  and soul conquer deafness to attain a higher level of consciousness and then communicate this to us through his music.  One can hear him doing this in his pure, not program,  music  where he is out among the galaxies dealing with things that do not connect to earthly concerns, or talking and thinking fractally with God.

The film's score was powerful, the performances first rate.  Costumes, scenery, stying right on the mark. The film approaches Amadeus in quality.  I sent a copy to my composer son.",1186617600,4,1892,5.157894736842105
2750183,4,B000MV8AE0,"The writers and producers of this movie worked hard to imbed informative nuances (such as his directing style) into this production.  I loved the music, and enjoyed the portrayals.  The presentation of the actual Ninth Symphony was amazing.  It made me feel the tension within the orchestra like I was holding an Oboe and was waiting to play just the hand full of notes comprising my part.  The opulence of the audience looked appropriate for that Age of Style.  Anna's emotions during her faux-conducting made it look like someone within a labor of love.

The movie material after the Ninth was I presume felt to be necessary but I did not find it pleasing.

Still, as a window into Beethoven, and as a unique view from within the orchestra, this is a good movie.",1185753600,6,764,4.656716417910448
2750184,4,B000MV8AE0,"It's not a documentary, and I doubt it attempts to be. Purists who have an encyclopedic knowledge of Beethoven's last years may find it hard to swallow, but it's a moving piece of film art which is in no small effort attributed to the music.

That the director and screen-playwright had certain agendas up their sleeves is nothing subliminal. It's afterall, a pro-feminist inquiry into an oft male-dominated territory and what more excitement to pit perhaps the greatest male composer who ever lived (and perhaps one of the most staunchly chauvinistic, though references have to be sought here) with an imaginary muse.

That Beethoven had many female muses throughout his life is known to most who know and have heard his music. ""Fur Elise"" is a case in point that requires no further elaboration.

The case here with Anna Holtz is a little different. In the film she does not challenge the titanic proportions of Beethoven's genius, but shares a glimpse of it through her daily interactions with him.

That she is really capable of doing so needs much more convincing (in lieu of her less-than-professional conducting, her decidedly facile compositions), but the merits of the show are still quite aplenty to cover whatever weaknesses in terms of credibility.

The show is an endearing caricature of Beethoven and the exploration of humanity that tries often to reconcile the man and the music. Anna is but a foil in the entire epic.

Ed Harris is quite irresistable as Beethoven. Diane Kruger is somewhat mild and unjustifiably put at a disadvantage by the fictitiousness of her character but she is, by and large, a competent actress and her role was emphatic not to say the least.

The period dressing was a little anachronistic for the ladies of the 1820s (backdated by about a decade); the men's were quite excellent (coloured, patterned cravats starting to become de rigeur) and Harris' wig quite very believable.

The scope is more focused than in Immortal Beloved; Harris' Beethoven is more lovable and though the ending was quite abrupt, I would recommend this film to those who are not familiar to Beethoven beyond his 9th, and even more so for people who have, before-hand, known that the entire character of Anna Holtz is pure myth, though a myth with a moral behind it.",1185235200,2,2283,4.896373056994818
2750185,5,B000MV8AE0,"This movie portrays a very unique perspective to Ludwig Van Beethoven's musical genius through the relationship we see between Beethoven and a young, aspiring female, composer, Anna Holtz, (Holtz is a fictionalized character) who becomes Beethoven's copyist for the debut of his 9th Symphony.

Copying Beethoven opens in Beethoven's life when he is already middle-aged, deaf, egocentric, already very well know in the music world for his earlier musical masterpieces, difficult to get along with and can be intimidating if not down right rude on purpose. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop Ms. Holtz from becoming Beethoven's copyist and actually giving her opinion on changing/enhancing a section of his 9th Symphony!

Ms. Holtz even helps Beethoven conduct his 9th Symphony for the first time before a live audience. This is a highly anticipated event as to whether it will be great success or be an atrocious failure as there were doubts about how this symphony would play out because no had ever heard of a choral being performed along with a symphony.

However, the performance of the highly anticipated 9th symphony was a huge success. Beethoven and Holtz continued their relationship after the performance of the 9th Symphony when Holtz shows some of her musical compositions to Beethoven in hopes of having him help her with her musical style. At 1st he rudely mocks her musical style, but then in turn helps her with musical compositions--- thus becoming her mentor.

I highly recommend watching this movie. It is very well acted and very well done plot/story wise.",1183420800,,1570,5.145098039215687
2750186,4,B000MV8AE0,"If you watch this movie and know something about Beethoven's last years, you ask yourself, why would someone possibly want to alter reality in such a way. For many purists this fictionalization of Beethoven's character is very annoying. However, Agnieszka Holland found in this script by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson a true inspiration to analyze these last fertile years. Anna Holz, the talented copyist that is sent to help the Maestro in the rush to issue the script for the first representation of the 9th Symphony, is actually a device utilized by the director to pose the questions that we would have asked if we had been there. She is the key to comprehension. Anna consents us to discover the significance of the change in key, the effect of a half note, the impact of deafness on composition of music, the value of the interval between the notes. Anna (played with great control and introspection by Diane Kruger) independently of her narrated life, her absent father, her nun aunt, her handsome and stolid fianc&eacute;e actually is not a character, she does not live a life of her own outside her relationship with Beethoven and the feelings she inspires in the Maestro are purely intellectual. The dissimulated love story is naturally present and it probably reaches its apex right before the start of the choral during the representation of the 9th Symphony, but it is cold, mental, there is no physical passion whatsoever. There is a truly  magic moment during which we see the faces of the female singers that are waiting for the cue to start singing.
Ed Harris' Beethoven has all the flare and the defects we imagine and know of the genius. His interpretation of brutality toward others and weakness towards his nephew is magistral, but he seems not to have a relationship with Anna. He sees her as an angel, a gift of God, a warning that death is near, an opportunity to think that his genius is understood and will live on. She is a sign of Fate or Destiny maybe?
As in all Holland's movies the cinematography is beautiful and reconstruction of period costumes is perfect. The use of candlelight, and ink, and food renders exactly the right atmosphere.
Once suspended disbelief, this intellectual reconstruction of Beethoven's creativity of the last years is fascinating and a pleasure to see and the temptation to believe its true is really there.",1182902400,,2381,4.864532019704433

2750188,3,B000MV8AE0,"This is a difficult movie to rate for me because I'm a huge fan of Beethoven's music and I have researched his life and compositions extensively.  First, it certainly is worth viewing just because it's about Beethoven but there are a number of scenes that will leave the purists hurling objects at the screen.  I mean someone, anyone, correcting Beethoven's music!  There's a thunderclap!  Beethoven's music has a frugality of content that belies the rich sounds and metaphors it invokes.  It contains a sort of musical minimalism and structural form that retains only that which is absolutely necessary.  His music is generally made from molecular bits of sound, carefully crafted and shaped to yield an incredible tapestry of sound with tremendous structural unity.

With this in mind, when Anna Holtz corrected the Ninth, I nearly fell off my chair (well, when she showed up as his assistant I was already mystified). Beethoven would've tore her to pieces if she had dared question a note much less correct him.  He did not take any meddling in his music kindly; even things as trivial as a listener's lack of attention would enrage him.

The scene with Anna Holtz helping Beethoven conduct the Ninth was not nearly as painful though it was utterly fictional. It helped in terms of an emotional underpinning for the movie.  In reality, Beethoven was still conducting when the orchestra had finished performing since he could not tell they had finished (his hearing loss was nearly complete at this point).

The movie does convey his contempt for flattery, his epic rudeness and his radical departure from the norms of composition during his time.  On the whole, I really liked the performances of the cast and, undoubtedly, the tremendous music.  On balance, definitely worth a spin though not without gaping flaws and glaring historical inaccuracies.",1182643200,14,1854,5.039344262295082

Some of the dialog--such as B. describing his intentions as he dictates a late quartet--is painfully bad.  Also, the Diane Kruger character wasn't interesting enough to carry the movie.  The scene of her assisting in the performance of B.'s 9th looked ridiculous, except:

It was B.'s 9th.  So it made me cry.

This has an Eastern-European earthiness and also a genuine reverence for music.  So it was clunky as heck in spots, even incompetent, but sometimes moving.  Good for a laugh and a few tears if you are a musician.",1182297600,2,626,4.627272727272727
2750190,5,B000MV8AE0,"This film exceeded many viewers' expectations, particularly Ed Harris's portrayal of the Mad Maestro, Ludwig von Beethoven. Knowing full well that Harris is more than likely one of the most talented actors working in main stream Hollywood today, when discovering he was playing in a period piece, and taking on the role of Beethoven, well, it just didn't seem to feel right...we see Harris playing current heroes and villains with his believability and unique flair, not a historical character whose been played before by a few excellent actors, such as, Gary Oldman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal-Beloved/dp/B00000K3TN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortal Beloved</a>&nbsp;(1990) and others. ""Ed Harris in a wig! Oh c'mon."" What an extraordinary surprise to sit back and actually suspend all disbelief and enjoy Harris's Beethoven - pure genius. All said and done, however, the true ""star"" of the film is Beethoven's masterpiece ""Ode to Joy"" his 9th and final symphony.

To be really honest here, the reason I came to see the film was to experience the music in booming surround sound in the dark of the movie theatre. If the performances became too unbearable, I thought, closing one's eyes and submerging in the music would be the perfect escape. This was certainly not needed as all the performances, including Diane Kruger's performance as the Maestro's ""copyist"" but more so, as the story unfolds becomes more his ""muse"", his inspiration to forge on to new territory in his music. Kruger as the beautiful Anna Holtz, rose brilliantly to the occasion when forced to help the maestro conduct the debut of his 9th symphony...this scene was moving in many respects. To hear this familiar music along with the images of Holtz and Beethoven conducting was almost too much to bear as my friend and I, without hesitation, certainly expressed the emotions the 9th symphony evokes...for this wonderful scene alone, the movie was worth three times the price of admission.

Joe Anderson as Beethoven's ""nephew"", Karl von Beethoven, was a superb performance as the young lad convincingly played the ""victim"" of his uncles `unconditional love' stealing money from the composer to feed his gambling habit. Those eyes were expressive in the deepest sense, a talent any budding film actor would die for because as some actors have stated, to have that specific `gift', that is, the camera capturing the nuances of profound emotion makes a true film actor. Anderson showed the audience that gift during the 9th symphony performance scene and one other that should be left unsaid for those who have not viewed the film.

If you have been `put off' from this film by some who call it `commercial', `vulgar', `a disservice', `too Hollywood', `boring' or otherwise, slide the DVD into the slot, turn out the lights and turn the sound up, way up...you'll not be disappointed.

2750203,3,B000MV8AE0,"Since I was a boy standing on the parapit of the fireplace of our living room and pretending I was conducting Beethoven's 9th as it played on our stereo , I wondered what it was like when Beethoven conducted it completely deaf.  It was rather disturbing to anticipate this during the movie, when they showed him at the end of the choral.  I was deeply moved when I had first read about how afterward unable to hear the crowd's appreciation and only feeling the vibration of their ovation. It was said tears rolling down his face were visable from witnesses.  The movie showed only his nephew crying.  A terrible diversion from what it must have been like.  Beethoven suffered terribly from what they termed as Melancholy. So it was hardly protrayed in the movie and worse could not protray his triumph at the end of his 9th's first exposition.

As many of us growing up listening to Beethoven, were awe-stuck with his genius.  Anybody can listen to Beethoven, or Mozart, Bach and not have any musical background to experience this genius, unlike Picasso or Eistein where it requires some education.  We are instantly attached to him personaly, and therefore need what little we know of him to be adhered to in a movie, even one as fictionalized as ""Copying Beethoven.""

Lastly, American production of European historical fiction always lacks credualty as the screen writer and director assume the dialogue can be of American accents and modern colloquial.  It is left to the audience to imagine how that they used American expressions like ""hard-on"" in German in the 17th century.",1178323200,2,1580,4.840148698884758

Beethoven's true life, not fabrications based upon marginal and basically unknown love fantasies about him are insults to the movie-going public and the nobility of his person.  I've lost any remaining respect I had for Ed Harris with this movie.  This movie does a great dishonor toward the spirit of a great human being.

While director Aqnieszka Holland fails in matching the emotional impact and visual grandeur of `Amadeus' or capturing the poetic nuances and exquisite melancholy of `Modigliani' it does succeed in providing the viewer with an insightful look into the sometimes tender, more often times volatile relationship between the musical genius and his copyist and muse Anna Holtz.

Ed Harris and Diane Kruger are magical together in the starring roles of Ludwig and Anna and it's a good thing they are because they literally are the movie. Fortunately their on-screen chemistry is successful and observing their relationship as it grows deeper and more profound is a joy to behold.

`Copying Beethoven' is a story of genius, isolation, longing and relationship with a subtle thread of spirituality intertwined throughout examining the nature of God and the ultimate meaning of life. Recommended viewing.",1177286400,7,1074,5.425149700598802
2750206,4,B000MV8AE0,"I took a chance and rented this movie only because I like Ed Harris performances. And Diane Kruger is always in more substantive roles than lightweights like Cameron Diaz or Kirsten Dunst. About Beethoven I knew just enough to know his 5th and 9th.

This was a very enjoyable movie, nothwithstanding some fans' desire for better historical accuracy. I found the pace just a bit uneven, and almost half an hour too long; the ""climax"" at the end of the 9th symphony should have brought a summarial ending more quickly, as the last 30 minutes' devotion to Beethoven's last work dragged in my opinion, because as one unfamiliar with his works, I had/have no appreciation for the 'Gross Fugue'; even some of the other reviews agree--its' inclusion brought no benefit, even among those familiar with the history.

I thought both performances of Harris and Kruger to be very good to excellent; it may be the best role Kruger has had of the three I've seen (Troy, National Treasure) and she wasn't lacking for acting ability. That the film was not focussed on Beethoven enough for some viewers wasn't a problem for me; the title implied to me that the main story line was about someone else, and Beethoven was the ""backdrop"". Still, I would agree that the film does focus on an albeit fictional portrayal of a character that even I doubted was a necessary medium for Beethoven's genius.

One review hit on a point that sums up the movie's 'validitiy' very well for me. It intrigued me enough to make me curious; and I ended up here, surfing for more information about the movie, the facts, and the recordings. The 9th is the *only* piece of music I have that I liked enough to have 3 versions of--von Karajan, Maazel, and my favorite, Solti. Mostly I was on a quest to find a better challenge for my stereo system. I dunno squat about the conductor's contribution and interpretation of classical performances, but for me, Solti opened better than the others(not that I've listened to a lot of versions of the 9th), and I've not heard an equal to Marty Talvela's baritone--""he belts it out from his shoes"" doesn't begin to describe it--and without power, resonance, and depth, the individual vocals and choir in the 9th can kill a perfomance. This movie had me waiting to the credits to see what recording they used, and though it's *early* morning here, I gotta hear Solti after I get off the pc.
