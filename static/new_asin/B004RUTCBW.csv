8439295,5,B004RUTCBW,"Oh my goodness, this DVD is beyond great!!!!!  It's gives one a small picture of what the book is about.  The book, which I also have and love, is full of valuable information, including the book that follows. After I watched the DVD, my sister and I both said at the same time ""I want /need to watch this over and over and over and over again, it's such valuable information"" The information is so healing also, and gives the best perspective on life, and one I found so true for me, that it was nice to know others experiences are the same. I would highly recommend this to anyone. And, if it does not resonate with you, perhaps pass it on until with someone else, it will.",1370390400,,675,4.265625
8439296,1,B004RUTCBW,"Very disappointing presentation overall. Wouldn't even consider sharing this one. Nothing more than a small-time lecture, not even one hour's worth of content for almost seventeen bucks, offering nothing more than a basic introduction to ""we-plan-our-life-before-we're-born"". If it's the first time you've heard that, this may be worthwhile to you, but it really goes nowhere and would be a better suited, somewhat worthwhile you-tube video, nothing more. Save your money.",1363392000,6,472,5.757142857142857
8439297,5,B004RUTCBW,"For those who have read and experienced Robert Schwartz' book YOUR SOUL'S PLAN: DISCOVERING THE REAL MEANING OF LIFE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN this DVD will be a reassuring and comfortable reminder of just how impactful that book was.  In  this DVD Rob Schwartz address a reading group audience and shares personal stories, stories shared with him by others, and the contents of his book.  Though it would be helpful to have read to the book before watching the DVD, that is in no way an indication not to purchase this item and open you home to others to share Schwartz' concepts.

The single most important concept here is that before we are born we plan what we want to experience in this excursion on earth, a time when we can alter misperceptions, accept challenges and grow into a new presence that will help us in the next 'birthing'.  By recognizing that we have planned our present life before birth we grow to understand the negative feelings we experience and instead of feeling remorse we are able to replace those feelings with forgiveness, gratitude for lessons learned, acceptance, and ultimately peace.

Schwartz has a calming manner about his delivery and even though we are able to see an audience to whom he is speaking, he make us feel as though the delivery is for us alone.  A talented speaker as well a writer, Robert Schwartz is on a mission to help us all find the meaning of the question 'Why?'  This DVD will be a valuable teaching tool for schools but it will be even a more valuable experience to share with family and with friends you love.

8439298,5,B004RUTCBW,"The DVD Your Souls Plan gave me a chance to meet the man behind the book, to get the flavor for Robert Schwartz's sincerity and commitment in the information that he presents. Your Souls Plan interjects a way of getting out of victim consciousness and into believing in divine order. I am a spiritual life coach and can personally wrap my
humanness around this concept very easily and have witnessed many walls come down with clients after the realization that this is all part of a divine plan (our own plan). The explanations given as to why someone would choose to come into this life deaf or have great personal tragedies removes the sting of the humanness we put on our trials and tribulations. I recommend this DVD and the book to everyone who feels in any way victimized by life. It could be the difference between resisting the life you have and embracing the lessons you chose.
