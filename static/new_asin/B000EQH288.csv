He makes the world of fascia clear and logical.",1360627200,,104,4.25

I highly recommend this series of videos to anyone in the health care / bodywork field.",1254268800,,281,5.878048780487805
8113467,5,B000EQH288,"like the others in Gil Headley's series, volume two is not your typical cadaver dissection. with a phd in theology, Gil is particulary suited to explore human anatomy in this setting, and his background with fascia will help you to understand this ubiquitous, yet often overlooked connective tissue.

this volume has a special bonus segment: the fuzz speech. ""everybody loves the fuzz speech."" it's true. you will too.

so, if you don't yet find the human body fascinating, watch this video. and if the human form already fascinates you, re-ignite your passion and check out Gil's work.

i'm just sayin'.",1198368000,7,604,5.02
