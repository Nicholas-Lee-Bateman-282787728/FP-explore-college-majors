3431333,4,B0019BI12I,"being off put simply by the name uwe boll, is a terrible reason to not see this movie...

from the opening scene to the ending credits the laughter and unadulterated shock never stop. boll takes shots and punches (literally in one scene) at everything 'hollywood' is afraid to even speak of. the balls to parody 9/11 is great, dave foley nearly steals the show, and god save me i loved osama bin laden in this film!

its so over the top, out of control, and wrong on so many levels that it worked to near perfection. the blu-ray quality is actually surprisingly good (side the extras that are all standard def and low quality.).

this movie is a well deserved 4.5/5 and highly recommended.

3431334,5,B0019BI12I,"OK, let's be honest.  If you are a very politically correct person then you are not going to be watching Postal.

If you are easily offended or belong to any racial group or human demographic (because Ewe has something offensive for everyone!) then you can find some way to be outraged by Postal.

Ewe leaves nothing sacred in this movie from lampooning religion to positing a connection at the highest of levels between the US and Al Quaeda.  Racial slurs and even abuse of the handicapped are found in this movie.

Some of the extras are the best parts.  Watching Ewe literally box with critics and beat the stuffing out of them is good, clean fun.  Watch the credits at the end to see that even Ewe took out some of his jokes.

This is not a movie for the kiddies, and I would be careful to watch this movie in a mixed crowd.  Think that your date or your spouse has an unvarnished, great sense of humor -- better think twice before you show this one.

As a guilty pleasure, this movie is fantastic.

Uwe Boll's other films are not too great, but postal is different

for those who have never played the game postal u may not dig the movie too much, although funny in spots, most humor is brought out by jokes in the game.

3431336,3,B0019BI12I,"Saying that Postal is the best thing that Uwe Boll has ever committed to film may not be saying an awful lot, but the truth of the matter is that Postal is definitely the best thing from Boll to see the light of day yet.  The similarities between Postal the movie and Postal the PC game pretty much end with the title, as Zack Ward (from TV's Titus and Boll's Bloodrayne 2) stars as the Postal Dude; a guy who's sick and tired of his white trash life in the town of Paradise.  Soon enough, he teams up with his cult leader uncle (Dave Foley) in a plot to help themselves out, only to run afoul of the Taliban (led by Osama Bin Laden).  Yup, Postal doesn't make much of a lick of sense, but it doesn't try to either, as Boll pokes fun at everything he can.  From 9/11, to George Bush, to any and every religion, to even Boll himself (who appears in a very funny cameo); Postal is guaranteed to offend (J.K. Simmons and Verne Troyer appear in small roles as well, in which very bad things proceed to happen).  It does lose steam after the halfway point, and if you're easily offended, you need to avoid Postal at all costs.  That being said, Boll does manage to partly hit the mark for what he was aiming for with Postal, and if you're the kind of person who can laugh at pretty much anything, this is surprisingly worth a look.",1220054400,4,1326,4.221343873517786

He has clearly made some terrible TERRIBLE bombs...but his vision was to make a slapstick comedy and thats what he did.  Clearly Uwe has no talent in the drama, horror or serious department...but now seeing his comedy vision (while its not GROUND breaking or amazing)it is definately funny and sometimes HILARIOUS.  As I personally know Uwe he definately needs to be commended on making his best movie yet, too bad it didn't get the theatrical release it deserved (but In The Name of the King did....YUK)!

Thanks Uwe for making a funny movie based on our IP!",1219881600,7,711,4.664

3431340,1,B0019BI12I,"First, despite seeing a number of Uwe's films, I'm not a Uwe fan or hater. I think that with anything, there is potential...but...there is a point where potential either gets used or abused.

So here is the thing:

Uwe tried to be too shocking at the expense of the humor of what was going on. The script needed work, just some tune-ups and some common sense things to make it a pretty funny movie, and especially funny if it was to piss people off. The first few minutes were traumatically funny, that's 'bout it...but let's be honest, this is not even a good B-Film.

There are scenes I think put in the movie just to be shock factor, and that's not necessarily a good thing. They seem out of place, seem to be making things *shocking* just for the fact of being shocking, and even then it seems forced. Uwe could have done a lot more, been much more funnier, and ultimately, a lot better movie if he would have edited it more, and went for the obvious humor than the unnecessary shock factor...it had shock factor already.

The scenes with Vern Troyer were very funny, the scenes with the sniper cat also funny, and the scenes with Bin Laden and Bush were also pretty good...it shows that maybe Uwe could make a better movie, a funnier movie, but chose to pepper the good with a lot of unnecessary bad. Did we need to see a full fronal nudity scene with Dave Foley?

Speaking of Dave, he is a funny guy, but he seems wasted as a talent here. Zach Snyder is dead on perfect for what he's doing, but that's it...the rest of the cast seems...drifting...at best, and in a comedy, you're either playing straight or your in the joke.

Again, was it the director or scriptwriter? I don't know...but the movie fails to live up to the humor it was promoting itself with. Did I completely hate the movie? No...it has moments, but those moments are few and far between, and the film feels cheap for not having more of them.

My two cents.",1219795200,5,1930,4.404494382022472
3431341,2,B0019BI12I,"The first twenty minutes of this movie was absolutely shocking: Uwe Boll was successfully making me laugh when he intended to.  I was getting really worried, in fact, that he had finally found a way to make a somewhat successful movie.  I mean, it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible.

Well...  then the rest of the movie played, and there's just no way to explain it: he drops the ball, miserably.  It got so bad, at one point a friend who was watching it with me said, ""Man, won't this movie ever end?!"" and another friend pointed out that it had only been playing for an hour and fifteen minutes.  This movie seemed to last an eternity!

What Boll is attempting here is to make a broad satire of the United States and general religiosity by pitting one man against The World: a cult, terrorists, random people on the street with guns, the government, the work force, and so on.  He uses the title of a popular videogame but this time doesn't even pretend to make it an ""adaptation,"" in fact deciding instead to only reference the videogame proper by having a character attack him on-screen for ruining the videogame (actually, this scene works out better than you'd think; the most surprising thing about this movie is that Boll actually shows he CAN laugh at himself, which was weird to behold), and a few mentions of the whole ""do videogames create violence?"" issue.  That kind of stuff generally works out, for better or for worse, in this movie.  All of the political stuff really doesn't.  It's either very simplistic ""Bush can't read"" jokes, or long-winded speeches by characters meant to be ironic.

What Boll manages to make funny are some of the more random elements: moments of scatological humor, randomly killing a bunch of children, things made of various meats exploding...  At the beginning, when it almost seems like there will be characters, it even seems to be going somewhere.  But about a third of the way in, the movie just goes way off track, and at that point simply drags.  Action scenes go on without end.  An entire thing is made out of getting Verne Troyer (of Mini-Me fame) into the movie simply for a single gag.  The locations themselves keep constantly changing, and Boll can't settle in a single place at all without finding some way to make characters run around for a while until they go back to where they came from.  It gets VERY tiresome VERY quickly.

So as much as I was fearing, during the first act, that Boll would disappoint me counter-intuitively by actually being successful, his dependable ineptitude eventually won over and, once again, I treated myself to a feast of pure incompetence.  Yet once again, it is worth noting that this movie is just that much better than the others, and so he still climbs the long, trudging ladder towards the day when he might actually figure what he's doing out.

And at least he proves he can laugh at himself.  When all is said and done, a fresh statement is made about an Uwe Boll movie: it could have been worse.

3431342,5,B0019BI12I,"I for one am a movie GURU, I own about 5,000, yes 5,000 DVDs, ranging from F class very low budget films that I bought for simple fun of how hilariously bad they can be(although some will actually surprise you once in awhile), to the big A rank hollywood epics and it's funny how sometimes a hollywood A rank movie can pale compared to some C class films.

Still I didn't mind House of the Dead, I'll admit it didn't follow the games at all really, but as a zombieish type film, it had enough going for it, and that's all someone can really ask, besides you want to knock a movie for being a bad zombie movie? Seriously, go watch ""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown"" or one of those other really poor grade ones.

Alone in the Dark I thought was uniquely done for a movie that seemed like it was trying to fuse two or even three genres together, Christian Slater coulda done a little better, but still, overall I thought it was an interesting vision and take on something that hasn't been widely explored.

BloodRayne I haven't seen all the way through sad to say despite owning it I always get interrupted, but I really liked the first half. Bloodrayne 2 I haven't had a chance to even start to watch but I am sure it is probably just as good as the first one.

Postal from what I've seen is going to be an amazing film, Zack Ward is one of my favourite actors, I loved him in Titus and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Vernon Troyer is a welcome addition to see him not in a Mike Myers movie.

I'm glad to see a Far Cry movie is coming out, an Alone In The Dark 2, and Bloodrayne 3. I hope they turn out as well as the other movies.

Heck as a starving actor I should probably look into auditioning for Uwe Boll films as there is a lot of room for extras to get one-liners and perhaps break into the Hollywood scene. Though I doubt Uwe'll ever read these reviews, I think it's excellent that someone is making movie adaptations of games, not direct transfers like RE:A, and Silent Hill was a travesty in my opinion, nothing like the games at all and guess what that director who has even less under his belt than Uwe is doing this year? An Onimusha movie, god help us all. Seriously though, the only two survival horror series left that need to get some form of movie that would make good ones, are Dino Crisis, and well... I won't mention the other, it's my most cherished game series, and if it's going to get adapted into a movie I want to be in on ground zero for it, even if I have to hope to win the lottery, and use all the money I win to go to Hollywood, hire a studio like Rogue and pump all money I can into it and hope that it pays off, much in the way the comedian who pumped all his money into D-War. Anyway I'm off-topic now.

My main point is that people have their own preference and taste, many people love sappy, romance, etc movies, while most people who love action and sci-fi hate those sappy romance movies. Frankly it's better to be open-minded, and all you close-minded people should eat a big one, because at least the directors and them are TRYING, what the heck are YOU doing with your life, hmm?",1215388800,9,3113,4.239460370994941

3431362,4,B0019BI12I,"OK, now I'm worried.  Over the last few days, I've actually enjoyed watching two different Uwe Boll films.  Could the man actually have some writing and directing talent, after all?  Nah, I don't think so.  He just got lucky with Rampage, and Postal is mainly a result of Boll letting it all hang out and not taking his job the least bit seriously.  It doesn't take a genius to direct a movie with the tag line ""Disgusting.  Offensive.  Stupid.""  Heck, Boll even dons some lederhosen and puts in a cameo appearance as himself, whereupon he's attacked by the designer of the video game Postal for making such a mockery of this video game adaptation.  It's certainly true that this movie has very little to do with the video game (a great and senselessly violent game I've been an unapologetic supporter of for years), apart from the massive body count and an irreverence toward just about anything and anyone under the sun, but it doesn't really matter in the end because this film is so darn funny.  I get all kinds of giddy just thinking about how deeply offended the politically correct Neanderthals must be by everything that goes on here.

The opening scene is one of the funniest in the entire movie, as we watch a couple of Muslim hijackers confront conflicting information about the number of virgins they're supposed to get by their martyrdom.  Radical Islamic terrorism plays a major role throughout the film, as Al Qaeda and Osama ""Sammy"" Bin Laden find their newest jihad plot constantly undermined by a group of crazy cultists executing a plan very much like their own.  Both plan to use a stolen supply of very scarce dolls for their own purposes.  It's just that one group plans to sell them on EBAY to pay the back taxes on their fake church, while the other wants to use them to spread death all over the country.  The hero (for lack of a better word) of the film is a poor schmuck sick and tired of his life in the hellhole of Paradise city - he's unemployed, his wife is the morbidly obese town slut, and his trailer park life is so miserable that he gladly returns to a life of crime alongside his cult leader uncle Dave (Dave Foley, who - I must warn you - appears completely naked in one wholly unnecessary scene) - anything to get out of Paradise, and I don't blame him for that one bit.  The whole story is just sick and twisted, and I couldn't even begin to tell you about all of the hilariously offensive scenes that take place throughout the film.  I think Boll threw everything he could think of at this story, and most of it actually works.

I think part of the secret of Postal's success is the fact that Boll seems to know he is making fun of his own infamously bad film career alongside all of the other satire about religion, government, and everything else under the sun.  He obviously didn't care about all of the movie critics he's constantly railing against (or daring to take him on in a boxing match), and that is why he made the film as ridiculous as he possibly could.  Let's just hope he finds time in his busy schedule of pumping out painfully bad movies to put this magical comedy formula to use again someday.",1320883200,4,3153,4.48861646234676
3431363,2,B0019BI12I,"The tagline on Postal is: Disgusting. Offensive. Stupid.  Well, at least one of those is correct, and the other two are subjective.  With Postal, our pal Uwe Boll has shown he's as good at making comedy video game adaptations as he is horror video game adaptations.  I know some folks think this film is Boll's redemption, but I'm certainly not one of them(I actually enjoyed Rampage much more).
Postal seems extremely forced to me.  It feels as though Boll sat around one weekend and watched Team America: World Police, a few episodes of Family Guy and/or South Park, and maybe a few Troma films for good measure, and said, ""Hey! I can do that!""  So here we get Postal, a movie that subscribes to the bogus philosophy that the more crude and un-PC it is, the funnier is must be!
In the film, a guy known as Postal Dude played by Zack Ward(who you'll remember as the bully, Scut Farkus from A Christmas Story-""He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes!!"") has a lousy life.  He lives in a sleazy trailer park, his morbidly obese wife is mean as hell and sleeps with just about everybody but her husband, and he can't get a job.  His life changes when he plans a heist with his uncle(David Foley), and he ends up in a series of misadventures that ultimately have him playing hero in a terrorist plot to release a bird flu epidemic on the U.S.(orchestrated by Osama Bin Ladin, who's in cahoots with George Bush).
So yes, the film is an onslaught of vulgar humor and outrageousness, minus any wit.  A makeshift pistol silencer is made by sodomizing a cat with the gun barrel and firing through the cat's mouth, there many graphic sex scenes with Postal Dude's wife having sex with various men, and an ongoing joke about how these guys can't find certain parts of her anatomy(Hardy Har Har), a corrupt cop shoots a woman for not going during a green light and steals donations from a handicapped man who he keeps in his garage(Ho Ho Ho), Postal Dude runs down a baby in a stroller with his truck while picking at a hangnail.
  Vern Troyer is on hand too(not that anyone cares about this guy), but his role exist solely for the purpose of one gag where in order to fulfill a apocalyptic prophecy, he is ""raped by 1,000 monkeys""(they're actually chimpanzees).
Does this all sound funny to you?  If so, don't delay another minute!  Hell, I'm no prude, I'm a John Waters fan for crying out loud, but this movie just seems so forced.  You can practically hear Boll screaming, ""Look! See! I can do other stuff!""
Now, with any film that crams nonstop gags in, some are likely to slip through and give you a chuckle or two, and Postal is no different.  Boll plays himself(I think) at one point and pokes fun at his image, and is attacked by the creator of the Postal video game.  I kinda liked that.
I can understand that Boll wants to shed the reputation he has built for himself, and in some of his recent films, he is showing us that he is capable of more than we thought, but Postal is just too desperate of an attempt.",1308441600,,3017,4.440217391304348

""Postal"" opens with what is probably the most tasteless 9/11 joke imaginable.  As it's unfolding, we sit in open-mouthed astonishment, asking ourselves, ""They're not really going to go there, are they?"" - and, by golly, they do.

And that's only for starters.  This satire - about the propensity of human beings to slaughter one another in the name of foolish causes - then goes on to make light of jihadists, the morbidly obese, religious charlatans, apocalyptic preachers, buxom bimbos, tie-dye-wearing flower children, latte drinkers, Asian drivers, sadistic cops, trailer trash, immigrants, civil servants, the handicapped, little people, insincere news reporters, neighborhood watch groups, suicide bombers, neo-Nazis, George W. Bush - you name it, it's in here.  For, if nothing else, ""Postal"" clearly prides itself on being an equal-opportunity offender, and no sacred cow - or not so sacred cow - is safe from its savaging.  It even has little children being shot point-blank by terrorists, replete with blood spewing forth in slow-motion as their lifeless little bodies writhe in the air then hit the ground.  The movie - overflowing as it is with wanton death, destruction and graphic violence - is, you will not be surprised to learn, based on a video game.

For their effort to turn ""political incorrectness"" into an art form, writer/director Uwe Boll and co-writer Bryan C. Knight certainly deserve a healthy amount of commendation and praise. In an age when too few comedies are willing to tackle serious subjects, there's something downright refreshing about a group of filmmakers who are willing to display this degree of in-your-face defiance and chutzpah.  But as so often happens with pitch-dark comedies, those who make them often mistake being daring with being funny - and, indeed, too often in ""Postal"" the humor itself falls well short of the mark, leaving only a bitter aftertaste in the end (less because it's offensive than because it's so poorly executed).

What story there is centers around a well-meaning schmuck, referred to simply as Dude (the likable Zack Ward), who's unemployed in a bad economy and having a devil of a time finding work, until he meets up with some crazy cultists bent on bringing the Final Days to fruition.  But, basically, the movie is a series of loosely related blackout sketches held together by the barest minimum of a plot and a desire to shock audiences out of their bourgeois complacency.

Not unexpectedly, given the movie's rather third-grade level of humor, vomit, poop and male genitalia serve as major sources of comedy in the story.

And when Osama bin Laden is telling George W. Bush he doesn't know how to quit him, you know you're in for some pretty rough going in the laughs department.

The good points however, are, it is ""politically incorrect"" (for people who can actually laugh at bad things).  The same plot/style that may be confusing for people who don't know the game, the movie follows the theme behind the game very much and reminds me a lot of the series.  So even if you have hated boll's other movies this one is worth watching especially if you have played either of the games.",1244764800,2,792,4.427586206896552
3431394,4,B0019BI12I,"The game is a lot of fun. If you are looking for a game with a great plot and storyline, this is not it.  But if you want a game that you can just mess around with for 5mins to a few hours, this is what you need.  But beware, intense violence and obscenity are sure to make even the most disturbed person wonder if this game went a bit far.  But that is why I love it and it is a great way to just kill a little time.

The movie, absolutley the worst movie I have seen in quite a while.  The character of The Dude didn't even remotely relate to the main character in the game.  It was a poor story and a terrible movie altogether.  The game and the movie seem so different that you would never know that they were based off one another if it were not for a couple referencesown in thr. 0 stars for the movie, but the game is so good, I gave it a four!",1237766400,,851,3.8285714285714287
3431395,4,B0019BI12I,It's sad that so many people fail to give Uwe Boll movies a chance. Postal is another great movie right up there with Bloodrayne as one of my favorite Boll films. The comedy and laughs from this film are genuine and the fact it's out on Blu-ray is just phenomenal. Buy it now!,1234396800,,276,4.226415094339623
3431396,1,B0019BI12I,"Sorry but this movie is unintelligable like most of his other work.

avoid this movie, like everything else Uwe Boll does.  This time the German director attempts Satire, but it just in not funny, nor good action.  or anything worth watching.  I am stupified at how he puts good actors in a movie, but then has the worst script ever, then the worst directing job ever.

avoid at all costs.",1231804800,,389,4.5
3431397,5,B0019BI12I,"...that you will find yourself remembering scenes from at times and laughing out loud. The ""Gluttco"" job interview is my favorite: ""...something wrong with - the chair..."", ""gotta put those heads on the wall!!!"", etc. Also, Bin Laden at the motivational business seminar: ""...turn your employees into a pack of little killer bees!"" and the mushy speech by The Dude near the end ""empty our hands of guns - and fill them with - HUGS!"" (followed by much gunfire).

Also -- OUTSTANDING soundtrack; I read somewhere that the woman who scored this movie was receiving some well deserved recognition for it.

Blu-Ray rendering is crisp and the sound is superb. Extras are kind of lacking (who wants to see 30 minutes of Uwe Boll beating up his critics in a boxing ring?).

Loved the ""Postal"" game series from Running With Scissors and the movie does it justice (plenty of dark, violent humor). Not for those with fragile sensibilities or the easily offended.",1230940800,2,951,4.8580246913580245
3431398,4,B0019BI12I,"This movie is based on the video game which shocked people and was baned in some countries.
You will receive Postal 2 the video game for PC with this movie.

Directed by Uwe Boll who has directed many more terrible game to movie adaptations than anyone else, such as House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Bloodrayne...

This is the first movie I think he has struck onto something, it is funny and has some good moments as well as bad full frontal nude scene.

I would have liked some more jokes with Bush and Osama reflecting real life, they went on vacation together as well as financed oil, construction...

It is worth renting and has some good moments",1227571200,,656,4.441666666666666
3431399,5,B0019BI12I,"Until I watched Postal, I thought the best thing Uwe Boll could do for the film world would involve the phrase ""retire forever,"" or maybe ""death by a thousand cuts,"" as its core concept.

This movie changed my mind.  It made me forgive Boll for all the horrible things he's done to my favorite games.  I borrowed this movie from a friend, ignoring his ranting about how great it is, and sat down grimly determined to see how badly Boll had mutilated another one of my favorite game franchises, but I was shocked:

Postal is astonishingly, disgustingly hilarious.  It is brutally brilliant in its determination to offend virtually everyone in the world, and to defile every single sacred cow within Western civilization, between the opening and ending credits.  It out-South Parks South Park.  Even Boll's previous moronic style of action movies are satirized with ridiculous shootout sequences.  Hell, Boll even satirizes himself in the film, playing a Nazi-gold-funded, vaguely pedophilic administrator of an Auschwitz theme park who also makes video games into movies.  How can you not love it?

I haven't laughed so hard, and so consistently, in years.  A fluke?  Notable only for its offensiveness?  Perhaps.  But well, well worth the money.  I hope he makes more.",1226534400,15,1268,5.028846153846154
3431400,4,B0019BI12I,"It's great to see a film that's brave enough to not be Politically Correct. Quite a few 'sacred cows' get slammed in this and it's both funny and refreshing. It's maybe a little funnier if you've played the game but you can still easily understand the plot without it.

Think of all the movies you've seen where you wish that once, just once, someone would behave the way they'd like to when confronted by an outrageous situation. Well, here's your chance. Don't miss it.  I wish more films like this were shown in Amerika.",1225584000,3,523,4.553191489361702

3431402,4,B0019BI12I,"The Good Things
*The Blu-Ray has excellent video; it is one of the cleanest, clearest, and shrapest movies I've seen.  Also has some great colors.
*Includes the ""Raging Boll"" feature (the notorious clip where director Uwe Boll boxes his critics), director's commentary, and some brief clip where Verne Troyer mocks Indiana Jones.  The cover says ""And much more!"", but that's not true; this is all of the features you get (maybe it's a joke on the cover).
*Also includes the PC game ""Postal 2"" (woohoo!).
*The comedy is surprisingly great at times.  There are some original jokes, and lots of great funny lines.  Some of it is crazy slapstick, other parts have thought-provoking satire (all the terrorist stuff), other parts yet make good fun of real-life situations (like the job interview scene).
*Includes some self-parody.
*Pretty good story.  It is well-paced and is hardly dull.
*Lots of action scenes throughout, especially at the end.  A few excellent special effects.
*The cameramanship is splendid.
*Production design is great.  Look out for all sorts of funny text on building signs, billboards, and props.
*The acting is great; the characters are quite zany and expressive.  Writing is good, and there are some good funny (perhaps even memorable) lines.  The cast is great; Zach Ward was always great with comedies, and even though everybody else are basically nobodies, they are distinctive and good.  Plus, there are a bunch of hot chicks in it.
*Some good music.

The Bad Things
*The sound quality is generally not bad, but it has some parts that seem to be very loud and other parts that are very low (DTS HD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0).
*Special features are in standard definition.
*Some parts do seem contrived and are there only for the sickness of it (like when the main character drinks spoiled milk, or the brief male nudity, etc...).

The Questionable Things
*There is quite a bit of perversity throughout (as promised by the package!).  Expect some toilet humor, violence (including the deaths of many many innocent bystanders; men, women, and children), lots of swearing, gross comedy, etc... Its not too graphic (except for all of the bloody violence), and serves to accentuate the comedy in many areas (it shocks you before delivering a punchline).  But if you're repulsed by such things, you should probably stay away.

I know what you're thinking:  ""Uwe Boll sucks and I'll never watch his movies again."" But believe it or not, this one is not so bad, and can even be considered funny and well-made.  This movie succeeds at being a perverse zany comedy.  I'm even surprised as to how much satire and self-parody there is.  Its not the crud I thought it would be; it is respectable and perhaps even a little thought-provoking.  Above all, its pretty funny.  If you have the tolerance for both the director and some sick comedy, you will find this to be great.",1223510400,3,2886,4.885010266940451

Not sure how much of a ""B"" movie this is, but the acting is not bad for ol' Skut Ferguson. I laughed quite a lot.

The video game it comes with is pretty much in-line with the movie, I installed it on a 64 bit windows 7 machine and aside from the DVD drive taking forever to recognize that it was there to install (I tried two different external drives with the same long wait), it installed and played nicely.
