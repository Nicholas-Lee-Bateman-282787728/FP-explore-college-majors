8325629,5,B000QA7UT8,This video was very done unlike some martial arts videos. The way the teacher explained each technique was very easy for the viewer to understand. What struck me was that this is a true mixed martial art. The way all the best techniques where taken to make a beautiful new art. A must watch for any true martial artist.,1374624000,,319,4.423728813559322
8325630,5,B000QA7UT8,Dvd's do a nice job bringing the text to life. Complement each other. But if you really want it take the classes.,1372204800,,113,4.181818181818182
8325631,4,B000QA7UT8,"This is a good introduction to street defensive styles. The instructor however is a little bit sloppy in demonstration and doesn't explain how to do some techniques correctly that can be difficult for some students. The optimistic attitude he shows is a great thing, but I would like to see him also emphasize some reasons why certain things are done, or why certain things don't work in certain situations.

The material in the program is great if you have a little experience and know what to look for. It will get you thinking about your techniques in the right way. But it is a basic course and I was expecting a little more depth for a six disk set.
Bear in mind I'm an instructor myself, and I can be a hard critic when it comes to these things. I really hate hearing people talk about things they think they know so much about, especially when those things can get someone hurt.
This man is not one of those guys.

I would recommend this over a vast majority of other videos.",1298332800,,982,4.419889502762431
8325632,5,B000QA7UT8,"Kuntao Jiu-Jitsu is the best of the best of many different styles.  It's practical, straightforward, simple, yet very effective.  I was very impressed with the method in which the information was presented.  If you're looking for a no nonsense and realistic self-defense system, this is it.

Well worth it.",1267920000,,306,5.183673469387755
8325633,5,B000QA7UT8,"Although I've just started to use this product, I'm hugely enthused by its possibilities. The system covers the whole range of techniques, from beginning to advanced. The presentation of the material is direct, clear, and comprehensible. The examples are shown from many different angles,which facilitates assimilation of the material.
  A couple of examples may illustrate the supremacy of this product: 1)Marc advises when confronted by an adversary armed with a knife to RUN;he then explains that a competent knife-wielder will cut you to ribbons and KILL you; since the guiding principle of this system is to return safe and secure to your home and family, RUNNING is the most reasonable tactic; of course, Marc follows up his RUN admonition with pragmatic tactics if you CAN'T run.  2)Marc shows how when one is confronted by a boxer, to use a modified boxing-stance, which effectively neutralizes the boxer's punching ability; this technique makes perfect sense: fight your opponent's weakness, not his strength.
  Considering the superiority of this product, combined with its reasonable cost when compared to traditional martial-arts training, it's a simple decision to purchase this SYSYEMATIC ""street"" self-defense regimen.",1204761600,2,1233,5.537234042553192
8325634,5,B000QA7UT8,"I purchased the DVD set on Kuntao jiu jitsu as there are no dojos in my area and as a karateka I was interested after visiting their website. I have only viewed half of the DVDs but I must compliment Sokedai Bochner on a SUPERB job of instruction. His explanations and examples are clear and easy to follow and the slow motion of the techniques in action makes it easy to duplicate. WELL DONE! These are GREAT DVDs and worth every penny! This is not the complete Kuntao Jiu Jitsu system, but it is definitely comprehensive and if you are interested in either this system or just want to learn self defense then these DVDs are a MUST!",1189641600,2,633,4.372881355932203
