5671994,3,B00BTFK07I,"i must disagree with the very negative reviews i've read.  yes, it's low budget, without a clearly defined message.

 however, the confusion and complete chaos of a real battlefield are shown well.

in regard  to complaints about not seeing the enemy clearly, where in the world do you get this idea that fighters allow themselves to be easily seen?",1387324800,,349,4.8474576271186445
5671995,1,B00BTFK07I,That failed to capture my interest after the first twenty minutes so I stopped watching it. The time would be better spent clipping your nails!,1387238400,2,143,4.76
5671996,3,B00BTFK07I,"was slow paced movie and the monsters so so.
The idea was good just needed more of a budget.

5671999,1,B00BTFK07I,"This movie sucks! Crapy Plot, crapy video, crapy sound, stupid ending, most of this was filmed in the dark. The ""aliens"" looked like men with cheap halloween masks. I haven't seen this bad of a sci fi movie since the 1950's. What a waste of time and money. Did I say I hated it? Learned my lesson to first read reviews and or watch clips before committing to spend my time and money on this.",1383782400,89,391,4.226666666666667
5672000,1,B00BTFK07I,"The story centers around Baker (Kevin Johnson) an EMT who is now in the Canadian army fighting alien invaders called squids. This is a low budget film as it focuses on a half dozen or so men walking through the woods shooting at stuff we don't see. The film opens with  Baker listening to a very irritating relaxation tape which includes one of the longest backwards countdown in film history since ""WarGames"" (1983).

There isn't much to see. The destruction on the DVD cover is never seen in the film, just Canadian trees. One guy in the film wears a gas mask for half the film, just in case. Very sad.

""Special Effects"" were not so special, the dialogue, the ""shaky-cam"" and the overuse of dark/night scenes (poorly lit.....along with more ""shaky-cam"") was more than enough to warrant the 1-Star review, but the plot (was there one?), the beginning, the middle and........not surprisingly the end, failed to achieve.......anything......except the hour and twenty-five minutes of my life I'll never get back.",1489536000,,472,5.619718309859155

But there are only two more scenes hinting at this lost love, so we can't connect his service in the armed forces with anything internal to the film. As far as character development, that was it. Everyone else is a one-dimensional stereotype, and the lack of dialogue in the movie does not help them to progress from generic soldier a to something memorable. This, coupled with a shoddy reasoning for why everyone was together in the first place (cliche mystery egg with weird powers that aliens want), gives you have a really terrible movie experience.

5672538,2,B00BTFK07I,"I agree with the others. This movie is pretty bad. The premise is a squad of soldiers taking a piece of alien technology (supposedly some type of biological brain which helps organize the aliens) back to headquarters when their helicopter is shot down behind enemy lines. The aliens want that technology back, while the soldiers attempt a rendezvous with rescue helicopters.

Sadly, that premise is far more exciting than the movie itself, which falls apart due to inaccurate military tactics, unbelievable characters, bad acting, dragged out scenes, poor set lighting (everything too dark), jumpy camera work, overuse of special effects (slow motion, etc), and so on. A better director with a better, more believable, script might have actually made this story work.

Anyway, after watching, I was left with the impression that this is a single episode of a television series, with everything (overall storyline, character development, etc) leading up to this episode, and the ending to the series (what finally happens), missing. If a series was the intent, its not hard to see why that series never made it into production.",1406678400,,1126,5.181318681318682

5672548,3,B00BTFK07I,"This is an amateur effort, and it's worth watching if you are interested in non-professional film-making. I've rated it with that in mind.

The technical aspects are not bad, the sound and video work are decent, and the special effects, props, costumes, and makeup are all pretty good for a low budget effort. The acting is weak, but not terrible considering the often unnatural and disjointed dialog the actors were given.

The plot concept is not bad, but the translation to the screen leaves a lot to be desired. The central scifi element, 'the system, gets its big reveal at 60 minutes in. This should be a climactic point in the film, and the actors do a fair job communicating the emotional tension, but the dialog is so awful that the scene difficult to follow. We're also left wondering why 'the system', which is a very important artifact, is in the situation it is in. Why was it being moved? Why are these guys who don't seem to be very good soldiers involved in moving it?

The ending is pretty weak too. It hints at the power of 'the system' in what happens to one of the characters, but doesn't provide anything in the way of resolution. It's unclear what happens to 'the system' and why.

Overall, if you go into this thinking of it as a student film you'll probably appreciate it more. From that perspective it gets a lot right (even if the techniques and devices chosen are old), and you can overlook many of the shortcomings.",1405814400,3,1443,4.55984555984556

Sound is bad, the acting is bad, and you can almost see the strings holding up the help's.  It looks like this was made by a group of college kids for their drama class and that is giving it more credit than it is worth.  I'm glad I got this for nothing but I still feel cheated.

5672671,1,B00BTFK07I,This movie by far is one of the worst movies I ever watched. Is it my imagination or are movies these days getting worse instead of better. Seem like too many of the movies we get to watch for free on Prime seem to be total no budget amateur screwballs! Maybe its all the competition out there to get dibs on good old re-runs leaving nothing but crapola for the rest of the on-line streaming movie gang! Not sure that is such a good thing or not! Old classic action adventure movies that we use to get to watch cheap now are starting to charge per view what I paid to see them on the big screen when they first came out!

The characters were enjoyable but need a little more development. If I have a specific gripe it would be that no one in the story thinks to pick up the alien weapons and use them against the enemy! That has always been something that happens when humans are in conflict. Think about the cowboys and Indians, the Viet Cong against US troops, the IEDs being used by the enemy in Iraq .

Yes, you heard me right.  I played this just to see how bad it was and simply fast forwarded it to the end.  The movie could have been titled ""Battle Woods"".  You basically have a bunch of guys, shooting at random trees, grasses, rocks etc.  They were battling the Canadian woods.  I guess it could have been named ""Battle Canadian Woods"".
