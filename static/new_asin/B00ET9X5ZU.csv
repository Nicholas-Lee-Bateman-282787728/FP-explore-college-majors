I will continue to show it to others. The movie not only presents the Kaduri story - but there is so much more here! Gallups and Cahn talk about biblical prophecies, the Jewish mindset concerning the Messiah, they give prophetic insight into certain scriptures, and Gallups gives a fascinating run down of current end time prophecy events. This is a keeper!",1384300800,2,531,4.911111111111111
5943202,5,B00ET9X5ZU,"Riveting from beginning to end. I saw it in a congregation setting with hundreds of people in attendance. No one moved. You could hear a pin drop. Spontaneous applause erupted when it was over. Powerful.

Carl Gallups and Jonathan Cahn do an amazing job of presenting this shocking story in a mesmerizing and surprisingly balanced manner. As an added bonus - Gallups gives fascinating insight into an oft misunderstood passage of scripture and prophecy. Further, Gallups goes into great detail explaining the prophetic times in which we live. This movie is epic!

5943213,4,B00ET9X5ZU,"Sad it is that the most prominent rabbi in the Jewish world of his day was like so many Jews in Jesus's day: too fearful of the opinions of his fellow Jews to speak about the Messiah he'd found.  The movie did a good job of explaining about this rabbi.  I watched it because I remember a kerfluffle about some big time rabbi who shocked the Jewish world by espousing Jesus as Messiah. This revelation was not made public until a year after his death.  His family (all long lived, it would seem) can't quite accept this big revelation because it turns their world and their ministry topsy turvy and leaves them with income problems.  I liked what the narrator said about that though, comparing it to a lot of big time evangelists in this country.  The takeaway from this documentary is, the biggest block to Jews accepting Jesus may well be Christians and their behavior as Christians and historically, as persecutors of Jews.",1473897600,2,925,4.615853658536586

It really allows you into the mind of a Jewish person and the stigma that they might carry if anyone found out they believed that Jesus was Messiah.

This movie was nothing other than the opinion of a ""Christian pastor"" on an event that may or may not have happened, namely, the vision of an unorthodox Jew that didn't really based his faith in the old testament but on the Kabbalah (i.e. ""esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal, and mysterious Ein Sof (infinity) and the mortal and finite universe (God's creation)"", as per Wikipedia.)

The ""Christian Pastor"" misuses, twists and misinterprets several Bible verses to say that we are very VERY close to the end of the world.

This ""documentary"" is a sensationalist report with biblically unfounded presuppositions that tries to arise an emotional response (excitement, awe, and fear) from its viewers.",1436054400,9,790,5.304

5943263,1,B00ET9X5ZU,"I know the title and subheading for this video sounds exciting, I fell for it. This video is just a head shot of a pea brain Baptist preacher talking over constant, unrelenting background music. Anything interesting about this video is in the title and subheading. Other than being mentioned in name only, there is nothing about Kabbalah, mystical visions, death curses, or esoteric Judaism in this video. As a lifelong evangelical Christian I know very well that the God we worship is 3 in 1 (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) so the preacher's argument in this video that Islam is not a Monotheistic faith but Christianity is (We as Christians worship a Trinity, not a single entity), ringed a bit hollow as Islam rejects the 3 in 1 theology and repeatedly insists that God is one, never adding other persons to Him. I pray Israel expands to the lands promised to it by God himself: From the Nile to the Euphrates!

This rabbi never claimed to be a prophet. He just said he knew who the messiah was""Jeshua or Jesus"". All of the old orthodox rabbies follow the kaballa, this included my grandfather who was a rabbi in europe and taught others the Torah. Concerning Matt 24: 4,5&11. You took that scripture out of context. Matt 24-28  refers to the first half of the tribulation and there multiple old test. Prophesies  concerning this. For ex: Ezekiel 13: 1-7, Zechariah 13: 2-6 to name a few. As far as taking over a soul, I have no idea of what you are talking about.

# No-peace-upon-him as the doctrine of hatred a web of such deception that only Satan could have invented Islam to destroy all of humankind by proselyting themselves on woven rugs spreading their heresy up to our Heavenly Father and poison the plant earth.

Complicated isn't it to understand this insanity and why is it so confusing, perhaps by evil intent?  Such is the thesis of SATAN who so reins over earth to harm, kill and destroy Gods chosen people by the hand of a false and illiterate so-called prophet along with his self-grandees appointed pagan deity called, Allh; to carry out Satans evil and instruct the condemned souls with such foolishness as they desire death for Allh according to Satans plan with the promise of a Jihad and to reap the rewards of the 72-virgins.  What about the Eves of Islam?  Whos waiting in paradise for these blindly cloaked women who have been diminished to sex slaves on earth for the black hooded Adams to carry out their caliphate?  Whose grandiose plan is it for this ends of days they so desire?  Whos going to prevail on earth as it is in heaven and whos forever consigned to the fires of HELL, lest we forget to believe by loss of our faith?

A vision came to me in a dream of my moments stood still in time with the beginnings of days until the ends of time.

 There was Adam and Eve; a magicka belief of Islam were of Gods human creation, whove so fell from grace by sin, expelled from paradise by the temptation of Satan.
 There was Noah; a righteous man built an ark to begin again after the great flood by Thy Wrath against the godlessness of pagan worship, again by the hand of Satan.  Then God delivered the promise of hope with a rainbow.
 There was Abraham; father of two nations and chosen by God.  Then came forth by Abrahams seed, Ishmael from Hagar with the blessing to prosper of other nations. Then came forth by Abrahams seed, Isaac from Sarai; child of promise begotten for the chosen people, spared from sacrifice to bring forth the new Lamb of promise.
 There was Moses; I Am, said He, I Am.  Moses obeyed and the first born male Jewish slaves of Egypt were spared at Passover and freed for 40 years times 40 more to live by Gods Commandants of the Covenant until Prophets proclaimed the Son of Man would bring forth the promise and to be saved by Grace.
 Yeshua; Son of Man, Lamb of God came forth until the day and time of the end of days in a blink of an eye to fulfil His promise and like a Lion to defeat Satans chain of evil on 2/3s of all mankind for salvation of the remaining and righteous third, for:  I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.  Ezekiel 25:17.  Yeshua was and is Perfect forever without end.
 Past-present Muhammad, self-proclaimed slave and messenger to a spurious pagan god named Allh, was purveyor of the nations of Islam and by the translation of Islam is submission to Allhs and their jointly evil whims to oppress lost souls and bring forth the antichrist to condemn their ilk to the gates of HELL for their final end without beginning.

 Taqiyya, Islamic principle of lying for the sake of Allh is okay by Satan who is so perfectly happy by this deception because he wrote and created the Quran with a fake god in mind to replace the Torah and attempt to destroy the fulfillment of the New Covenant by Grace such as the hoax of the gospel of Barnabas.  Satan enlisted Muhammad to follow this sham willingly by greed and conquest.  Then Muhammad appointed himself as Allhs holy messenger to further corrupt, suppress and torment humankind for satanical whims of earthly things while the sado-submissives head-to-toe in pajamas raise their offensive stink up to heaven five times a day with their repetitive and hollow Muslim prayers without beginning or end.  Whats the point of all of this madness of a 1400-year-old occult that still thrives?  Why not?  Satan exists and thrives to despise Gods creation and he is forever consigning the lost souls by mans freewill to the depths of the lake fires in HELL.",1413072000,,4263,4.539267015706806

I know my Bible pretty well and it just didn't set well with me. This book is a book for itching ears. I wasn't impressed. I don't know enough about Judaism or the mystical Kaballah to be a good judge but as I read some of this book I got more and more uncomfortable and as a result lost an entire nights sleep. I don't recommend it. This book should get 1* for the picture on the front and that's it! I found the author to be misrepresenting his education with only his word regarding his diplomas.

5943316,1,B00ET9X5ZU,"Once again, christian missionaries, messianics, hebrew-christians, fundamentalists are resorting to fanciful interpretations to a note which may or may not have existed.
Let's look at the facts. Why would a 108 year old Rabbi ""hide"" the identity of the Messiah? Religious Jews repeat 3 or more times in their prayers their belief in the coming of the (HUMAN) Messiah who will ingather the exiled of Israel, rebuild the Holy Temple (WITH BLOOD SACRIFICES) and most importantly help fulfill the verse in Zechariah 8:23 ""This is what the LORD Almighty says: ""In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, 'Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.'""
All 3 of these major Messianic prophecies are in DIRECT theological contradictions to Christianity. Without going into details about the above (I recommend the books of Gerald Sigal for the explanations, books which christian missionaries are afraid of reading) prophecies, let's just assume for the sake of argument that the good Rabbi (who believed in the God of Israel and observed His commandments (Biblical & Rabbinic) till his dying day) did say that the name of the Messiah will be Yehoshua, or Yeshua (same thing). SO WHAT! One thing is clear, neither Kaduri or any religious-observant Jew for the past 3500 (And I include jesus of Nazareth in that history -see Mark 12:28-29- ever ever believed that God can be a man, let alone the Messiah. The Messiah will be a HUMAN BEING, not some super hero demigod which PAGANS believed in (and some still do).
The fact is Yeshua or Yehoshua is a common name today amongst religious Jews. IF the Rabbi said that's the name, fine, but why jump to the conclusion that he was talking about a jewish kid from nazareth who did not fulfill a single major Messianic prophecy? The only verses he DID  fulfill were those found in Deut. chapters 13 & 18 and for the past 2000 years any jew who converted stopped doing the commandments thereby making him a fulfiller of these prophecies!",1397692800,2,2066,4.754874651810585

5943322,5,B00ET9X5ZU,This film is a controversial account of a famous Jewish Rabbi (Yitzhak Kaduri) who lived into his hundreds (108).  He achieved a status among the Jewish elders in Israel of Leader in the fundamental rabbinical community in Jerusalem.  Prior to his death he told his followers that he had seen a vision of the Messiah and that the Messiah would come to Israel soon.  He said he would leave a note to be opened a year after his death which would reveal the actual name of the long awaited Messiah of Israel.

5943332,2,B00ET9X5ZU,"Rabbi Kaduri expressed a view that the man who died on the cross may actually be a messianic figure for the Jewish people. This in no way accepts the overall story created after his death concerning his deification and the creation of a new religion. I like the Rabbi believe that the man known historically as Jesus may well have been a Messianic figure as he clearly stated ""I come for the Jews."" Individuals who believe that Jesus was the ""son of God"" who came to create a new religion which sperceedes Judaism are grasping at straws to prove that their beliefs are correct by pointing to Kadri and incorrectly using him to assert that the Jewish people somehow missed the boat by not transforming their religious beliefs to following a new and improved theory of god's plan. Kaduri is a great thinker like centuries of great Jewish Rabbi's who were willing to raise important issues. In order to understand Kaduri you must understand historic Kabbalic discussions concerning the messianic concept  which can incorporate Jesus as a Messianic figure who has importance to the Jews BUT was not in any way trying to change Judaism into a religion based on his being part of a godhead triad.",1389916800,5,1190,4.748792270531401

What this is NOT, it is not a monotonous monologue of just one man sitting, talking to a camera. This was the perception I got from some of the reviews previously written here. It is FULL of scene changes, and vintage film footage of earlier times in (what is now) Israel. There are still life photos, current comparisons of scenarios of THEN AND NOW....
Commentaries aplenty of those who might be deemed as qualified to make commentary.

The only person on this entire DVD that I wouldn't listen to give the weather report is Mr. Cahn ( a self-proclaimed ""prophet"" and self proclaimed messianic rabbi ). (I just turn the dvd on fast speed, and listen to him speak like micky mouse). That pretty much remedies that!

Beyond all that, having been to Israel several times, having a minor in middle east studies at University, and an avid reader of the subject, I would say that this is a very worth while purchase. Got mine for 10 bucks, and plan to watch it several times before I pass it on to someone else.
There is a price to pay to be a believer in the Land. and we see the name calling that ensued this revelation. But I am not disheartened,
This Rabbi risked everything for what he believed and experienced, and he even made the judgment that his family that lived after him would have to deal with this question.
