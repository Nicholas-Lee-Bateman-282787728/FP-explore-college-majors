8563652,5,B001LNOKK6,"I liked the three aspects of how they trained the Model UN teams, one method is the same I learned but the other two I was like ""what?"" I still recommend this to others, it shows how much work it does into Model UN at different perspectives.",1366588800,,241,4.148936170212766
8563653,1,B001LNOKK6,"As a high school Model U.N. instructor I thought this would be a great way to introduce MUN to new students.  In fact, the product description says the same thing.  And I quote: ""An excellent way to introduce your students to the exuberance and value of Model U.N. participation.""  So I bought the DVD and watched it first (luckily).  The language is terrible.  It's a reality show for MUN partipants.  Not entirely a bad thing but when they started using the occasional expletive I began to be worried.  THEN the insructor starts using the f-word! (multiple times)  Very tacky and not a good reflection on the MUN program.  Save your money.",1254096000,3,641,4.702702702702703
