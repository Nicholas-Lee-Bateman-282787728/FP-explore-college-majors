8295398,5,B001DXS44W,"I HAVE NOT FOUND A WRITTEN BIOGRAPHY AND SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISITS.  THE DVD WAS D0NE WELL AND BROUGHT HER PERSONAL & PROFESSIONAL LIFE FORWARD IN A TASTEFUL MANNER, WHICH WOULD ONLY BE HOW SHE WOULD LIKE IT.  I LOOK FORWARD TO POSSIBLY SEEING OTHER DVDs PRODUCED BY THE BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL.",1368576000,,298,4.5
8295399,5,B001DXS44W,"Yes it was less than an hour long, however, it is so interesting to see how Martina McBride started out her illustrious career without the help of a show such as American Idol. She truly is the most down to earth and humble human being in her industry with killer vocals and a purity in her voice like no other. Not too many female artists in country music or any genre can pull this off. Very worth the buy!",1232323200,3,408,4.177215189873418
8295400,5,B001DXS44W,"This is a thoroughly engaging portrait of country music singer Martina McBride. Unfortunately, because it is an episode of the A&E ""Biography"" series, it is only 50 minutes long. Nevertheless, the portrait fills its limited time with good coverage of her life and career, and her interactions with her husband, John, that are caught by the filmmakers are enough to make any fan want to purchase this DVD. The DVD does a good job of highlighting McBride's career as well as her commitment to her family and how she balances the two. Overall, one comes away with the impression that she is a talented yet down-to-earth woman, who deserves her reputation as one of the nicest members of the country music community.",1229990400,7,712,4.844262295081967
