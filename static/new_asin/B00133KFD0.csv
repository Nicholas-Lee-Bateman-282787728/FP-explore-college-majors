8249019,1,B00133KFD0,"We didn't like, we expect something else!!! The  characters and the dialogues seemed like something was missing, and not even the action scenes were entertain it :(",1363737600,,164,5.074074074074074
8249020,5,B00133KFD0,"We rented this movie from a video store and my kid loved it. She loved it so much that we decided to buy it.  ""Dragons: Destiny of fire"" is often back ordered so we were thrilled to find it in stock at Amazon this Christmas. Its hard to find movies about Dragons that are not violent so if you have a kid who loves dragons this movie is a good idea.  One drawback, its kinda too campy for adults so, be prepared to not be entertained parents. It was originally written in Spanish so sometimes the dialogue doesn't really translate well but every kid I have ever shone it to loved it.",1324857600,,583,4.196428571428571
8249021,4,B00133KFD0,"Although as an adult I found this movie barely tolerable, however the kids LOVE it!  John John is a big favorite.  What kid doesn't love dragons?  The storyline itself is ok, however, it is the dubbed English voices that I couldn't tolerate.  Again...the kids didn't seem phased by it and never noticed what was driving me so crazy, so I give this 4 stars.  It loses only one for being slightly annoying to me!",1261958400,,410,4.486486486486487
