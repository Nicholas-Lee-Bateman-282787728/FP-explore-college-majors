6283623,5,B00IO90G6M,This family-friendly film is funny on many levels. Loved the characters! We've viewed it with visiting family members over the past few weeks and it was enjoyed by all.,1399334400,9,168,4.827586206896552

6283625,5,B00IO90G6M,"Lots of humor suitable for the entire family.  Some of the lines will probably go right over the heads of young children, but everyone else will ""get it"".  Everyone from 6-70's enjoyed it greatly at the theater, went to see it twice, and we are delighted to add this DVD to our collection.  Sending it to family members away from the area, as well.",1396396800,11,348,4.40625
6283626,5,B00IO90G6M,One of the more entertaining movies I have seen in a very long while. Very well put together. I saw it at a friends house and had to order one for my DVD collection.,1396396800,10,165,3.8823529411764706

6283640,1,B00IO90G6M,Easily the worst Mormon movie they have made. Not funny. Ends with the most poorly choreographed fight scene I have ever seen. The plot is the love child of Mobsters and Mormons and Return with Honor. Lower your expectations.,1426636800,2,225,4.794871794871795
6283641,5,B00IO90G6M,"I think that the target audience for this movie is small, but if you're reading this then you are it. You'll enjoy it. My whole family enjoys it. I sure hope that they will be able to make more movies like this. I have many lds movies and this is in my top 5 of lds movies. 1- Best two years. 2- down and derby (I know not really lds, but very relatable to lds) 3- on the road with j golden Kimball. 4- sons of provo 5- this...",1425686400,,427,3.808988764044944

6283661,5,B00IO90G6M,"One of the best, most funny movies I've ever seen.  A great missionary movie that my kids love just as much as me.  I highly recommend this movie!",1405296000,4,146,4.178571428571429
6283662,5,B00IO90G6M,"Our entire family loved it!  My kids are still quoting from it a month later.  It was well done,  not too cheesy like some mormon cinema.",1405123200,2,137,4.1923076923076925
6283663,5,B00IO90G6M,"Way out but fun to watch.  This type of movie is certainly improving.  Liked it a lot, so did my kids and grandkids",1403222400,3,115,3.9565217391304346
6283664,5,B00IO90G6M,"A well done fun film that is sensitive to the religion of the Missionaries.
Some suspense that holds ones attention.",1402876800,5,116,4.85
6283665,5,B00IO90G6M,"First off. I am not an Mormon movie person. For example recently I ""watched"" unitards, I didn't even make it 10 minutes in. This movie however was hilarious! I actually enjoyed it- a lot. I thought the premise was a little over used at first. I am pretty sure there is a movie out there called the Mormons and the Mafia. And then there is that whole studio c skit, tht is basically a shortened version of this movie. However this movie deserves its own spot up there with Best 2 years. The actors were actually believable and there were enough twists and turns to keep it interesting! The ending I could sort of see coming but at the same time I was still curious to see if I was right. I feel like this movie could be enjoyable for anyone who need a laugh. However young shield ten may not get everything. The best part was when one of those fatso mafia dudes pronounced nephi and neffi! I love it!
Some may find mildly cheesy but it wasn't over the top!",1401753600,7,955,4.252747252747253
6283666,5,B00IO90G6M,"Action with a twist all mixed up with humor, touching moments and family friendly. You want to see it again soon after once the whole story is revealed and enjoy it all the more!  The missionaries as well as their mafia contacts are personable and likable.",1400457600,2,256,4.565217391304348
8643909,5,B00IO90G6M,"Really funny movie, especially if you are LDS or understand LDS humor. If you are not familiar with the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints then some of the jokes might not make sense.",1493596800,2,189,4.588235294117647

8643912,5,B00IO90G6M,I bought this for movie for my boys not really knowing what to expect and they loved it.  It is nice to be able to watch a comedy with the entire family that is completely age appropriate for everyone and still funny.  My husband and I always enjoyed watching it.,1477699200,,263,4.24

8643915,5,B00IO90G6M,whole family loves this movie!!! Always nice to watch something entertaining and clean.,1470873600,,87,5.769230769230769
8643916,5,B00IO90G6M,"A bit silly in places, with a little dumbkoff situational based humor. The movie was very light and entertaining through out. In some ways perfect way to introduce some of the most basic teachings (what is the general message missionaries are trying to convey) without any heaviness. There are some inside jokes that the LDS audience would have the opportunity to explain to a non LDS person. Overall it was funny, had a great ending and one can watch it repeatedly and still chuckle.",1452816000,3,484,4.773809523809524
8643917,1,B00IO90G6M,"I expected this to be a cute spiritual movie about our missionaries.  However, it couldn't have been further from L.D.S. beliefs.  I should have checked to see if it was approved by the church prior to ordering.  It wasn't funnyit was silly/stupid!  It was SO bad I discarded it, rather tha reselling it on Ebay!  The disc itself was in great condition!",1443139200,,353,4.629032258064516
8643918,5,B00IO90G6M,My teen LOVES this movie.  She watches it all the time and knows every line from it.  Was delivered as expected and was as expected.,1442793600,5,132,4.24
