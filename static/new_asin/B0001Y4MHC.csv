8018170,5,B0001Y4MHC,The DVD arrived in perfect condition - no scratches of any kind. I LOVE this movie. I remember watching it as a kid and being so scared! Living dolls used to terrify my sisters and I when we were younger. Watching this movie brought back some good memories :) I'm really glad I was able to find it!,1414454400,,298,4.155172413793103
8018171,5,B0001Y4MHC,I really enjoyed this movie and glad I now own it because I like to watch things over and over every once in a while.,1388188800,,117,3.72
8018172,4,B0001Y4MHC,"My Teacher Ate My Homework is a cute, funny fantasy-horror flick that tweens and families will enjoy. It has just enough ""ewww"" quality to give goosebumps to the kids -- but not too intense. Adults will enjoy a sweet performance by Shelly Duvall, a stern but misunderstood teacher.

If you were ever a fan of Shelly Duvall's Fairy Tale Theater, you'll probably enjoy this film. (And, as Ms. Duvall's fans have always suspected, she is quite a doll!)",1231804800,,449,4.756410256410256
8018173,5,B0001Y4MHC,"This is a film in witch a young boy named Jessie(Gregory Smith-""Small Soldiers"") fricken' hates his hag of a teacher(Shelly

Duvall-""Popeye""). So one day Jessie and his friend Cody(Edwin Hodge) go to a (pretty) crappy lil' shop of horrors.",1124150400,2,239,5.128205128205129
8018174,5,B0001Y4MHC,"Middle-school student Jesse Hackett (Gregory Smith) is not happy with his teacher. He believes that Mrs. Fink (Shelley Duvall) is out to get him and fantasizes about getting even with her. When Jesse finds a voodoo doll that looks just like the hated teacher, his wildest dreams of revenge are answered--until the evil doll comes to life and begins wreaking havoc on the school!",1086825600,3,378,4.921875
8018175,1,B0001Y4MHC,"Even by its own, not particularly lofty standards this is a terrible film --- bubblegum for the kids' eyes on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
When he burst onto the Canadian film scene with Soul Survivor in the mid-1990s, director Stephen Williams was hyped at the Cannes and Toronto film festivals as the Great White North's answer to Spike Lee. In his dreams ...
The bald fact of the matter is that Williams suffers from an advanced case of arrested creative development, one so pronounced it's why he's now limited to working in kidvid.
His storytelling abilities are mired at the 1970s-era, DC-comic level. Only auteur Williams is nowhere near as imaginative as writers and artists like Len Wein and Bernie Wrigthson who avoided all the cliches Williams so eagerly embraces while toiling on the DC ""mystery"" titles.
So rather than rent or buy this video, go down to the nearest comic book store and dig out a musty old copy of House of Secrets --- it'll cost you less and the contents will be more entertaining. Your kids will thank you!!!",1004918400,,1037,4.734806629834254
8018176,5,B0001Y4MHC,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. The doll is hilarious, and I always use her little sayings. She says things like ""Ouch!"" ""When you lie you pay!!!"" ""traitor"" and ""hmmmmm (while playing cards)"" in a strange voice. Suttercup is just a little person that thinks she's so cool, but she's not. And, she's just trying to be cool saying that it is a bad movie. Don't listen to someone that extremely recommended a classical tranquil music cd. Geneva and Sol, who are also in the movie, say things like ""whales sing to each other when they talk!!!"" What's up little brother"" ""voodoo hoodoo!"" "" reeeeal trouble"" ""bad stuff"" ""the place- near water!!!"" ""that's cool"" and do things like scurry right on over to $14.95 jewelry. This movie is so funny and is much more of a comedy than a horror movie. The doll also says things like, ""Eeeeeeeeeekkk Shoulda used a laaader"" ""ohhhh!"" and walks with little legs and smashes pitchforks. On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) it scores a 891,456,826,379,264,825,999!!!!!! Buy this movie!!!!!!",984614400,,1039,4.714285714285714
8018177,5,B0001Y4MHC,"Gregory Smith was heavy he won the young artist award ""best actor in a leading roll"" for this movie",983318400,,99,4.2631578947368425
8018178,1,B0001Y4MHC,Family aimed comedy looks a little something from a Goosebumps novel. Not funny at all. One of the worst family movies I have ever seen!,952300800,2,136,4.48
