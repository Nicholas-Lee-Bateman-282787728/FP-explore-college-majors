8138328,5,B000HC2NK6,"I have owned the CD version of Tennstedt's live performance of the Mahler No. 1 with the CSO for many years. Of the several performances I have of this symphony on CD, I always return to it as my benchmark. It is so intense. I was delighted recently to discover that the same performance was captured on film in this DVD. I was spellbound by Tennstedt's conducting. He obviously loves this music, and both his baton and face are so expressive. The CSO give an outstanding and very attentive  performance -- Really, is there a better orchestra in the world, whose every musician plays like a virtuoso? -- I realize that many find Tennstedt's slow tempi less than ideal, but I find them very effective -- indeed, powerful -- in this performance of the No. 1. I also enjoyed watching and hearing the crowd in Orchestral Hall leap to their feet with raucous applause.",1359504000,,863,4.603896103896104

With family and friends we have enjoy it.",1320451200,,122,5.1
8138330,5,B000HC2NK6,"The recording of Mahler 8 something of a great occasion. Klaus Tennstedt, by that time far from well, gives his all in the performance of very deep assurance and expressive freedom. The performance of the Mahler 2 is also very fine.",1316304000,,232,4.682926829268292
8138331,5,B000HC2NK6,"Mahler's Symphony 1:

The picture quality for Sym 1 (Chicago Symphony Orchestra) did not appear as good as on the disc of the  Sym 8 (London Philharmonic Orchestra).  Fortunately, the Dolby Digital sound in both is fine.

Immediately in Sym 1, the tempo seemed so slow that I thought my DVD player was failing.  Soon, I realized that the extremely slow pace was Klaus Tennstedt's choice.  A check with another Amazon review confirmed that my impression of everything seeming stuck in molasses was not just my impression.  It's only fair to warn you of the extremely slow tempi throughout--it's almost as if they were trying to see how slowly it could be played.  Yet even the slow pace had the benefit of drawing my attention to things I had failed to focus on earlier--like the passages so reminiscent of  klezmer music, and others sounding like giant, symphonic waltzes.  So, there is something to be said even for the unusual performing technique.

And now, on to the piece de resistance:  M8

Mahler's Symphony 8:

Barely seven minutes into the performance and we already experience a triumphant exultation--one beautiful soaring melody after another in this wonderful celebration of life.

Yes, there is great singing (all the soloists and choirs are magnificent!) but even more important are the absolutely GORGEOUS parts for the human voice.  This is why the human voice is the greatest of all musical instruments.  If you like beautiful singing at its passionate best, this is a performance you will return to frequently.  Really--I've never seen singers open their mouths wider with volume and passion!--just right and totally appropriate for this grand work--a celebration of life and forever after.

I almost feel guilty about singling out tenor Kenneth Riegel for his inspiring and powerful singing, for the other soloists are equally excellent.  Perhaps it's just me, but as he sang so brilliantly the ""Jungfrau, Mutter, Konigin,"" and the harps came in, I almost thought Klaus Tennstedt was going to join me in tears of happiness at the sheer beauty of this incredible piece of music.

If you've ever wanted to soar up to heaven, and take a look at it, to raise yourself to higher spheres, then this is your ride!",1308787200,8,2226,4.946091644204852
8138332,5,B000HC2NK6,"Klaus Tennstedt's Mahler was often larger than life, particularly strong in shaping the great structural lines, but equally attentive to detail, surely more ""Teutonic"" than the readings of other great contemporaries like Bernstein, Bertini, Boulez and Gielen, to name just a few. Alas, little of his art has been preserved on DVD. There is the fascinating 1988 LPO Tokyo concert recording with Wagner ""orchestral highlights"" which has the famous moment when the invariably awkward Tennstedt beats his music stand into submission (you can watch it on utube), fittingly during ""Siegfried's Funeral March"". And there is the present set of two DVDs: Mahler's First recorded with the CSO in Chicago's Symphony Hall in 1990, and the monumental Eighth, recorded with his LPO and various soloists and choirs at the Royal Festival Hall in 1991. Both recordings are in very fine 1990s film and sound. The powerful, slow and nuanced First shines in every respect, and Tennstedt has a beautiful rapport with the Chicago musicians who follow his every gesture and his at times odd baton technique. As to the Eighth, you might want to read about my own problematic relationship with this work in my review of Bernstein's exuberant DVD version (together with Mahler's Seventh) elsewhere on Amazon's site. Tennstedt had recorded it before (it is contained in his CD set of the complete Mahler symphonies), and his audio version did not fully convince me, mostly for technical reasons. The DVD also shows the natural limitations of encompassing a huge complement of participants as a whole and, at the same time, doing justice to individual human and orchestral voices. Even in an ideal concert hall setting (any suggestions as to where?) some parts of the score will be lost. Given this qualification, I find this recording magnificent in every respect. The soloists are very good, the orchestral and choral contributions as well as the organist equally outstanding, and Tennstedt brings a special sense of occasion to this deliberate, probing, grandiose and deeply felt interpretation that can hardly be surpassed.
P.S. I think I spotted Sir Georg Solti in the front row of the audience. Does any one of my fellow-Amazons know if he attended the concert?",1280966400,9,2239,5.136986301369863
8138333,5,B000HC2NK6,"Skip the 1st Symphony with Chicago (extremely disappointing when compared with the 8th) and head straight for the amazing performance from London. If this doesn't grab you, you're probably dead. Wow.",1219968000,5,199,5.451612903225806
8138334,5,B000HC2NK6,Tennstedt is well thought of as a Mahler conductor and he doesnt disappoint here. Both performances deliver on a well produced disc. Suprisingly I find myself reaching for the recently released Haitink DVD's of him conducting Mahler 1&2 which is unusal in the sense that Tennstedt outranks him as a Mahler conductor yet I think I prefer Haitink. Both are worth having and are highly recommended.,1167955200,10,395,5.0
8138335,4,B000HC2NK6,"Everyone says that Tennstedt was so much better live than in the studio. I don't really agree with that, especially in his latter years, where his tempi simply got slower and slower. If you happen to be an admirer of Celibidache's glacial Bruckner (I'm not), this DVD may very well tickle your fancy. But for me - in spite of the fact that the Chicago Symphony  play superbly well - Tennstedt's late analog Mahler first goes farther in capturing the youthful freshness of the work (Tennstedt's very first Mahler recording). The live 8th here convinces me even less. Yes, everyone is terribly committed to what Tennstedt is doing. But that's the problem - who amongst these highly dedicated participates was going to tell Tennstedt that Mahler's compositions don't gain a thing by constantly stretching linking passages and harmonic cadence points, to a point where the music all but comes to a dead standstill? I found myself yelling at the screen, ""oh, come off it! - just move on with it now"". While Tennstedt's vision of the work is truly apocalyptic, Bernstein's Vienna Phil. DVD of the Mahler 8th from 1975 - which comes with a fine Mahler 7th as well- is much more celebratory in nature. So is Tennstedt's own studio recording on CD, which just got remastered and reissued on EMI's ""Great Recordings Of The Century"" series, coupled to his lively account of the fourth symphony (but not nearly as well recorded as his 8th). No complaints about Tennstedt's vocal soloists, who are all very good. But Kenneth Riegel sounded better in '75 (Bernstein) than he does here - a bit strained in the more taxing moments. I'm still giving this four stars because the sound and picture are quite good (I was tempted to make it three).

Unless you just have to hear how well the CSO can sustain the Mahler first at such slow tempi, I recommend giving this the slip and getting either, or both, the Deutsche Grammophon DVD of Bernstein/Vienna Phil. doing Mahler 7 & 8, and/or EMI's ""GROC"" remastering of Tennstedt's mid 80's studio recording of the 8th (coupled with the 4th, as mentioned above). All three M8's mentioned have plenty of organ.",1165536000,43,2134,4.780487804878049
8138336,5,B000HC2NK6,"These recordings are with two different orchestras (Mahler 1st with the Chicago Symphony and the 8th with the London Philharmonic).  Tennstedt's live performances are much better than his studio versions of the same works, and it's wonderful to watch him coaxing what he wants from the players.  Even though he conducts from the score rather than from memory, he always seems to be directly connected to the orchestra in an almost magical way.  The sound is good in both performances, and there is a sense, on both occasions, of being present for something quite special. These are great performances. High recommended!",1160265600,28,619,5.108910891089109
