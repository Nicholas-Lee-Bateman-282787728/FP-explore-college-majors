7981160,4,B00008AWQX,"Not only did I like (actor Victor version) Invisible Man on TV; my Mom (I'm 46, she's 72) liked it, too. I mean REALLY liked the show!....A thief is given an experimental invisibility surgery. Now he can have fun, right? Well, not too long: the leash that a secret government organization has is that they have what he needs. No, not his female handler. The inserted surgery item gives him him invisibility, but if he uses his invisibility too much, it (quicksilver) tatoo on his arm gets completely filled in and the rest of his days is in Qucksilver Madness. The small secret governmental (all kept on a light-humor feeling) has shots to give him when his quicksilver is too used up. Using it to be his thief-self means that his quickfilver drops too fast when he needs to use it for his next secret case........We've only had Season 1 (of 2) for SO LONG! Canada/UK/etc. have had Season2 for a long time. Problem, their DVD players aren't like ours. Rumor was that Season 2 would FINALLY be released for U.S. DVDs in May. Where is it in U.S. DVD? ... Also, other supposedly ""complete"" Invisible Man are only listed in the reviews on Amazon as having only the 1st half named and no indication of the second. I'm eager to get the U.S. version of All Seasons or Season 2 in DVD!",1339113600,4,1277,4.484978540772532
7981161,5,B00008AWQX,"FINALLY !  Please - please - please get this into a DVD (not BlueRay) format that I can see in the U.S. !  Mom & I are both disabled and we loved to watch one episode for each lunch together of the first season of The Invisible Man. We can't Wait to actually get to share watching Season 2 !!!
In a nutshell: The Invisible Man was a convicted thief. His brother, working on an invisibility gland, got the thief the chance to get the gland and go free. Whoops - there's 2 problems: 1. His brother was killed so they can't safely get the gland out, and 2. If he doesn't get a shot via a small government agency after using invisibility for so-much time (measured on a tatoo on him), then he'll go into Quick Silver Madness. Basically, we get a regretfully invisible thief, who still gets a little bit of something kidish back at the agency now and then. Oh, and while his male partner's an ok-ish/maybe guy to Darian Fox (our invisible thief), his ""Handler"" that gives him his shot after using so-much invisibility is a babe in his eyes.

7981163,5,B00008AWQX,"Simply stated, I love this show. I was shocked when Sci-fi decided to end it after its second season. It was good to begin with, but things were really moving at that time. As time goes by, I keep checking to see if it is available on DVD yet. It finally came to region 2 dvds. When I learned this I thought, ""Yay! It can't be anymore than a few months now!"" Wrong, we are still waiting.

I really hope it will be released soon. I love this show so much, and would love the opportunity to watch it again. I especially miss seeing the interaction between Fawkes and Hobbes. Classic!",1182384000,6,581,4.2342342342342345
7981164,5,B00008AWQX,"One of my FAVORITE series, it was short lived, long overdo to be put onto DVD. Sci-Fi Channel had a bone to pick with it for whatever reason (I was on Save I-Man UPN wanted to pick it up, but Sci-Fi snubbed it... and whatever reason spent so long putting it to DVD or syndication)

Well, it has great writing, character chemistry, Darien and Hobbes so great together esp by Season 2, that duo's interaction is worth the price of admission right there. Plus Fawkes was a role model for me, his hair and style always similar to mine, an expanded it as result (should see my hair =)

CANT WAIT TILL CAN GET IT! (Region 1 come on now... it'll happen...)",1160179200,7,649,4.311475409836065
7981165,1,B00008AWQX,"The DVD set listed online will not play in the United States.

I assumed Amazon would not sell in the US a DVD set that would not play in the US.  WRONG.  In addition, the packaging was open when recieved.

I wrote the vendor to get a refund.  They told me that since the box was open I could not get a refund.  Since it was open when I recived Amazon stood behind the sale since the vendor would not.  I was refunded what I paid.

If anyone hears of this DVD set coded or use in the US tell Amazon to sell it.

Thanks!

Thanks",1151280000,7,527,3.8867924528301887
7981166,5,B00008AWQX,"This listing is for the Region 2 release of I-Man in the UK.  It was released in the PAL format in a 2 part box set for season 1 only.  If you really want it, you can get it from amazon.co.uk.

This set was put together by a real fan of the series.  Its packed with extras such as trivia, scripts and cast commentries especially put together for the set.

A region 1 release of this series, and realease of season 2 in any location is long over due.  Given so many minor TV series have been released in recent years its truly amazing that in 2006 there is still no sight of this box set in Region 1.",1150934400,6,599,3.991596638655462
