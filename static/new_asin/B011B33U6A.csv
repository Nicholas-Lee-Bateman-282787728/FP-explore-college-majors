It was also beautifully filmed and had marvelous backdrops whether city, apartment, office, country home or island beaches.

7331887,5,B011B33U6A,"I saw the first of these three about when Skyfall was released.  I remember thinking about the two films as being somewhat parallel, aging Bond-types, facing the ends of their careers and their weaknesses, yet maintaining their sharp competence into their later years.  These Worricker films are terrific because they resist the temptation to rely on gunfights, car chases, and precipice fistfights.  Instead, all is at risk, and a quiet, intelligent man deals with it. Try it. You'll like it.",1451520000,5,493,5.1375
7331888,5,B011B33U6A,This is a compulsively watchable series with an interesting plot and great acting.,1450828800,2,82,5.384615384615385
7331889,5,B011B33U6A,"Terrific! Don't miss it. If you're like me you probably watched Page Eight and then were unable to find the other two parts. Now they are available in the US [in Region 1] and Blu- ray. Each episode is a bit different than the first one but all coalesce nicely into a whole. The acting is great, the story is very good but the script by David Hare is what really makes this work. Plus, besides the always cranky but lovable Bill Nighy it's fun to see a series with a wide range of actors including Rachel Weisz, Christopher Walken, Winona Ryder, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, and Judy Davis.",1446681600,17,598,4.445454545454545
7331890,5,B011B33U6A,"When I reviewed the DVD for the BBC Television film Page Eight in 2011 here on Amazon, I gave it five stars and stated that I watched it without knowing anything about the plot. (It aired on PBS in the Masterpiece Contemporary series in edited form but I missed that. The story  written by David Hare (and directed by him as well) was a thriller about the British Intelligence Agency in the years after 9/11/2001. It was complete and had an acceptable ending. What I didn't know, and even the shows producer didn't know at that time, was that Hare planned it as the first part of a trilogy.  And a year later, he wrote (and was hired to direct) the second film  Turks & Caicos (where that episode takes place), with much of the cast (Bill Nighy as the central character, Johnny Worricker  hence the title of this BD  Ralph Feinnes, and a few minor characters returning to actually start a whole new adventure. Then in 2013 the third episode, Salting The Battlefield was created and filmed.

When I received this  BD (I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an objective review), I thought Worrickers name sounded familiar and I realized I had already seen Page Eight but watched again  and it was just as great as before  and then the other two (for the first time). Hares script and direction, and Nighys acting (they have worked together many times) is the thread that holds it all together. The cast  who appear in one, or at most two, of the episodes includes Helana Bonham Carter, Christopher Walken (great job!), Judy Davis and Michael Gambon.
There is no physical violence in any of the three films (Hare says in an interview segment  more in a minute  that this is a spy drama but without the violent explosions and killings of a James Bond film. In fact there is not (and this is NOT a spoiler) not one gun used in this series.  Its all psychological.

Since the show is best enjoyed knowing nothing going in, Ill encourage you to avoid any reviews with details of the plot. Trust me on this. If you have seen only one or two of the three films, youll want to replay the three from the beginning.

The package comes with three discs, one for each film. There are no bonuses on the first disc. The Turks disc contains a behind the scenes featurette (19 minutes) with comments from all the major cast members along with Hare as they discuss  briefly  the first film and spend more time on the second one. The third disc has a similar featurette, this time concentrating on the third (and final) story.

Each of the films runs from 90-105 minutes and are the UNEDITED versions with sufficient adult language to point it out.

Someone posted a note on my review of Page Eight asking if it had English subtitles. I no longer have that disc but others posted there were none. Well, this time there are subtitles and, while I did not need them for the first two films, I found them useful for at least the first 165 minutes of the third one as the accents and speed od talk was pretty fast.

Well there you have it. A high recommendation and no spoilers. I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I was only sorry that three episodes was the entire series, I would have enjoyed about 10 more years worth. The series was full of stars who all worked well with each other. The whole thing constantly made me wonder if they based the prime minister on Tony Blair around the time of 9/11. Worricker isn't James Bond, but there is enough spy excitement with humor to enjoy the action.",1491091200,,487,4.609195402298851

Quite pleased with the purchase.",1490313600,,340,5.035714285714286
7331905,5,B011B33U6A,"Huge fan of Bill Nighy, whether he's playing a retiree, vampire king or British spy. Another example of how Brits blow us out of the water in making excellent mysteries and dramas. While sex, blood, gore and explosions might entertain some, I prefer the more methodical reveal of clues that require thought and critical thinking to solve the puzzle before the end is revealed. The more cerebral British mysteries really fills that void in U.S. programming. Have yet to find a British mystery or drama series that I don't like. Only criticism of Worricker is that series was to short. Worricker is one of the series I watch when home sick.",1489536000,,638,4.756756756756757

A ""spy"" thriller for the THINKING viewer. I saw this series on PBS out of context but was so taken with the bits and pieces that I immediately found this trilogy at my library and watched it on a binge 3 times. This is so good that I've GOT to buy it for myself so I can play it over and over and show it to friends! If you are appalled by ""American"" spy movies, but love the Brit eccentric style of the whodunit sort you'll LOVE this quirky corruption story by a great writer David Hare. The acting is superb. Bill Nighy- my favorite aloof TV character since Jeremy Brett.",1488499200,,708,4.213235294117647

7331919,5,B011B33U6A,"First seen on PBS and I immediately loved the series.  Just had to add the films to my movie library.  No blood and gore here with this mystery series, designed for the espionage aficionados and ordinary mystery lovers like myself.  But simply great acting and terrific, thought provoking writing.  Bill Nighy is perfectly cast in lead role.  Helen Bonham Carter, Christopher Walken and Winona Ryder, among others make up a solid supporting cast.  Ms Ryder's performance, in particular, stands out and is award worthy.  Plot line is woven masterfully through the three films.  Recommend setting aside a rainy day, popping a big tub of popcorn and binge watching all three films.  Blu-ray played fine on my U.S. purchased machine.  Picture quality of Blu-ray was excellent and what you would expect from PBS which has a reputation for quality productions, such as Sherlock, Wallander, Inspector Lewis and Endeavor to name a few.  I do advise, however, to review 'regions' before purchasing anything foreign produced.  Some disc players are finicky in that regard.  For those of you who prefer more sophisticated movie fare, do yourself a favor and buy the Worricker series.  You won't be disappointed.",1472601600,5,1200,5.118556701030927

But Nighy is the series and he can't carry the story line by staying in his usual stoic character.  The series just doesn't seem well put together, and the female leads look so much alike that their individuality gets lost in trying to sort them out.

8724001,2,B011B33U6A,"If you watch a fair amount of TV, you'll probably like the series.  If you don't, you probably won't.  I rarely look at TV, and this series reminds me why.  Unlike nearly everybody else, I thought the casting of the women was poor, and the dialog not believable.  Too bad, I was hoping for something a lot better.  Too many F-bombs, a complaint not because it's offensive but because it reduces the story to silly outbursts.  And finally, as for Page Eight's story line, the notion of secret sites run by the Americans is hardly news, so the episode seems like it could be 15 years old, right off the bat.",1532649600,,605,4.405405405405405

8724005,3,B011B33U6A,"I saw the first movie in this three-movie series, streaming online, and liked it so much that I ordered the full set. Alas, the makers took a great idea and ran it out far past its ability to keep the story going. I suspect that it was so popular on British television that they quick put out two sequels. The second in the series is just plain bad, redeemed only by the fact that our hero's girlfriend and fellow spy is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a very good actress though she appears rather young to be playing about with Mr Nighy. The third flick picked up a bit but still didn't reach the level of ""Page Eight,"" which is indeed a movie worth seeing.",1523664000,,659,4.28
