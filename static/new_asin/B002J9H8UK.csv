6435107,1,B002J9H8UK,"Amazon you must be kidding. This was not watchable, and a warning not to copy the show kept popping annoyingly every 2 minutes.  I have no idea why anyone would copy this except as an example of what not to buy, watch, or stock a video library with.  Please be a little more selective with your customers time and patience.",1507420800,,323,4.366666666666666

6435110,3,B002J9H8UK,"Many defects in the execution. It was obvious the director NEVER said ""Take Two"".
Phone conversations were strained because of delays - obviously voice-over which did not sync correctly.
Terrible stiff acting (until the later third, by the 2 main actors) on a crude and clumsy script.
Sound editing was amateur. Different camera angles had different noise levels and sound profiles (from tinny to bassy to washed out within any given scene)
The 'reverse' scene in the pizza place was too long and obvious that someone was very preoccupied with regurgitation.
Most of it was beyond credibility in a bad way.  We are expected to believe that Damon has this super secret box to figure out, and he does it in a public park?

I have seen PLENTY of low budget films that were not super low quality, so budget is no excuse to me.
And the 'no copy' message that kept flashing on the bottom of the screen was VERY annoying (who would WANT to copy any of this?)

The story idea was ultimately entertaining, but it took a lot of patience to get through the terrible execution.
So my point is, if you can stomach the hacked, clumsy, weak efforts and you have nothing better to watch, the last half is somewhat entertaining.

So I am going to rate this right down the middle.",1362355200,6,1262,4.570796460176991

6435112,3,B002J9H8UK,I've seen a lot worse with way more of a budget. I really liked the fake out in the middle of the credits. Thought it was over... Very cool,1272844800,,139,3.8275862068965516
6435113,1,B002J9H8UK,"All I can say in this idea of a review is that I was extremely disappointed beyond all known imagination of the word belief.

This film is obviously made, edited and produced by a film-makers study course from some obscure college out on the fringes of the Twilight Zone.

I cannot believe at all that I spent my money on this film.

If cheesy is your type of film, watch this and be completely satiated.  Else spend your human intelligence on some real professionally produced movie.",1267488000,5,484,4.593023255813954
6435114,2,B002J9H8UK,"Starring Jeb Bush, this classic ""made for Amazon Prime"" film displays VHS quality, 80's sound-board effects, video editing that displays Jeb Bush's jeaned ass within 2 minutes, and some fantastic iPhone grade effects.  I laughed 3 times within 30 seconds.",1510704000,,255,5.375
6435115,1,B002J9H8UK,"I want to congratulate the actors and the movie director. The Ethereal plane movie is a fully functional, working time machine.  From the moment you click play, you will notice that time slows down considerably. According to my calculations, \Delta t={\frac {L}{c}}, each minute that you watch feels like an eternity. Based on this, I am safe to assume the plot velocity is way outside anybody's patience point of view. I recommend watching this at a minimum of 4 light years away while you are near a black hole. The high gravity should provide enough time dilation to create a suitable environment. If you have trouble finding a black hole near you, you can always use a supercomputer with a minimum 9 googol at the power of googol petaFLOPS so you can play this movie fast-forwarded at Graham's number speed. Those are your only 2 reasonable options to make this movie watchable. However, I feel obligated to mention the third option. A little unorthodox and might void your warranty, but you can always hack your playback device. First, you need to microwave it, boil it, place it in the oven, burn it with liquid hydrogen and at the end throw it in the hot molten lava in the deep heart of Ironforge, Dun Morogh. After you complete these easy steps, your device should be in good shape and make this movie watchable.",1510617600,2,1321,4.693965517241379
6435116,1,B002J9H8UK,This was really low budget with special effects out of 1950. I should have gone to bed early,1510444800,,92,4.166666666666667
6435117,3,B002J9H8UK,"It looked like the movie was filmed in the 70""s complete with the effects that era had to offer. Some of those effects actually made me laugh. The football scene comes to mind. So, why a solid 3 1/2 stars? Well the plot was okay, and the acting was okay as well.

I would say it's worth spending 1 hour and 19 minutes",1510185600,3,317,4.031746031746032

6435120,1,B002J9H8UK,"The idea was good, but the movie was bad.
On top of a bad movie, the movie maker keeps flashing ""property of something or other media, duplication prohibited"" or something similar about every minute on the bottom of the screen.
No one would want to duplicate this film so they could have skipped that major annoyance.
Not worth watching unless someone else completely redoes the movie from scratch using this idea.",1508976000,,414,4.845070422535211

8660297,1,B002J9H8UK,I'm a fan of low and no budget indie films. But you've got to at least have one element that doesn't scream amateur to get that second star or better. Ethereal Plane crashes in this and any other timeline.,1530489600,,205,4.282051282051282
8660298,1,B002J9H8UK,Bad acting. Bad cinematography.  Stopped watching after 10 minutes.,1529712000,,67,6.444444444444445
8660299,2,B002J9H8UK,"Lots of rewinding as a cinematic device in this film in the ""sci fi"" category where it belongs , as opposed to Science Fiction.
The tense (literary); action (cinematic) of this 70s/80s style film one degree higher than the Bionic Man, caused me or made me predisposed to mostly use the FFW button.

Now the ending --how unconventional. Spoil Alertness: read all the credits, its a must, or the the time is nigh, not!
Worst movie I've made myself endure for oh maybe...35 min all told, throughout most of which my curiosity was mildly stimulated and mind driven to write this bad review of mine concerning a movie for which it is not fair of me to judge 'cause I did not give it the chance it deserves. But a 2star is better than one ---curiosity mildly stimulated , as I said, implies entertainment value.

Maybe I will give it a better 'go' in future. Thanks for the freebie Amazon ( you deserve thanks , given that you charge, and a lot , for stuff , and far far worse ----some with 80% less running time, like Oceanus, which I bought by mistake, and you wouldn't refund since I didn't catch the acct debit for 3 days)",1524787200,,1120,4.405797101449275

8660303,4,B002J9H8UK,"Four stars, more like 3.6 stars, rounded up to 4 stars, and just barely so, and with some qualifications. The story line itself is very good, but the execution, in terms of script, scripted lines for the actors, the actors, and the quality of acting, well, they were at times quite marginal.

One of the most disconcerting things about the movie was that the actors playing most of the more prominent male roles all looked kinda alike, like they came from the same family or clone batch, or something, a batch of slightly plump pasty/pale-skinned white males of medium height with nearly-identical greasy/greased-back hairstyles, and brown hair, and vaguely-similar facial features, and this made it kinda hard to tell male characters apart at times. I realize that the movie was made in Canada, and that many Canadians are likely rather inbred due to geography and socio-economic realities, but nonetheless, the obvious inbreeding of most of the male characters in this movie was rather overdone, and kinda scary. Like, what does this portend for the future of the human race?

However, ultimately, the show was bearable, and the acting was not so poor and painful to watch that I was ever tempted to turn off the film and scream in horror, which has been the case with many other amateurish indie films that have been trumpeted at Amazon.

And at least the reviews for movies here on Amazon are largely real reviews by real people, rather than the film reviews at Neflix, which seem to be largely 4-star and 5-star reviews written by shills or by PC-based robotic software apps.

So, bottom line is that if you like sci-fi, and you like time-travel films, and you know about retrocausality, and you can tolerate indie films which are kinda amateurish but not overly bad, you will likely like this movie.",1512691200,2,1805,4.85064935064935
