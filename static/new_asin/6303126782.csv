7838556,5,6303126782,"Michael Caine the person is just as entertaining as many of his screen characters, as borne out by the interview segments in this hourlong portrait. Between Caine's remarks and numerous film clips, the mood runs  from hilarious to poignant.  You get to see him trying an Irish accent  (before 'Zulu'); playing in a TV 'Hamlet' opposite Christopher Plummer;  creating the famous Harry Palmer and Alfie roles; and even the dim-witted  Sherlock Holmes in 'Without a Clue,' among many others.  Well worth the  price if you're a Caine fan--and who isn't?",951350400,3,549,5.033333333333333
