Historically, the film is inaccurate, but so was The Longest Day, Tora, Tora, Tora, Pearl Harbor(especially), Lincoln and even Dunkirk.  But I don't turn to dramatic movies for history lessons.  I have documentaries for that.  Dramatic movies are for entertainment.",1510704000,2,539,5.209302325581396

8164723,2,B000LWLUZ6,"This movie claims to be about the 18 month long 1173 - 1174 rebellion against English Angevin-Norman King Henry II by his Plantagenet wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine and three of their four surviving sons:  Henry the Young King, Richard, and Geoffrey.
The movie is rife with inaccuracies.
Henry II was 40 years old in 1173 and yet he is portrayed as a white haired middle aged man at least 10 - 15 years older.
Eleanor was 51 years old in 1173, but in this movie she is a sex crazed 30 something woman, hardly old enough to have born her three grown sons.
Henry the Young King had just turned 18 years old before the Rebellion, but in this movie he is portrayed as 10 or more years older.
Richard was 16 years old, but in the movie he is also portrayed as 10 or more years older.
Geoffrey was 15 years old, but he too is portrayed as at least 10 years older.
French King Louis VIII is portrayed by an age appropriate actor given that he was 53 years old in 1173, only two years older than Eleanor who was his former wife (divorced).
In this movie Richard is portrayed by an actor (Greg Chandler Maness) with black hair and dark skin whereas Richard was said to have hair between red and blonde with a pale/light complexion.  Compared to other actors in the movie, Maness appears to match Richard's height of 6ft 5in.
The movie claims that Richard is saved by Alys/Alice, Countess of the Vexin, but in reality Richard and Alys were betrothed in January 1169.  Alys was the fourth daughter of Louis VIII, but in the movie Alys and Louis VIII have sex.
The movie explains Richard's rebellion against his father as revenge for Henry having imprisoned & tortured Richard.  I can find nothing that supports this claim.  In fact in 1169 Henry had agreed that Richard would inherit Aquitaine & Poitier from Eleanor.  In 1171 Henry gave Aquitaine to Richard tgen Richard and Eleanor toured Aquitaine.  In June 1172 Richard was formally recognized as Duke of Aquitaine.
During the Rebellion Richard stayed at Chateau de Taillebourg, Charente-Mariti in what was north Aquitaine.
Henry the Young King and Louis VIII defended Rouen from Henry II.  That's not how this movie depicts events.
Rouen appears below snow-covered mountains when in reality Rouen is on the River Seine near the English Channel.
The musical score is overly dramatic.
The movie requires subtitles given the uneven sound and occassionally mumbled dialogue.",1495324800,13,2415,4.692671394799055
