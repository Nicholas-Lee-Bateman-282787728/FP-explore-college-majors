7909859,1,B00000IC7U,"Okay! So I haven't seen ""Suddenly"" yet, however, ""Til the clouds roll by"" was NOT worth buying. I got it thinking I was getting a Frank Sinatra movie- my dear friends, He was in a whole whopping 3 minutes of the movies. He sang a song at the very end and THAT's IT. If you want a Sinatra film, don't get this.",1455580800,,309,4.0
7909860,1,B00000IC7U,"No knocks on the two movies-- they're both worth seeing.

The issue here is the product itself.
This MADACY gray box series is of the lowest possible quality. Their SLP dubs track poorly and have degraded video of unrestored public domain stock.

Truth is, at that snail's pace speed they could've fit three or four films on a single VHS instead of issuing this double dose space-waster.

Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode.",1249430400,3,536,4.741935483870968
