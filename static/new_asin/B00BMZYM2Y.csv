8571242,5,B00BMZYM2Y,I love this series and have loved Macross since I first saw it as a kid. This series helps to carry on the tradition.,1420243200,,117,3.9166666666666665
8571243,2,B00BMZYM2Y,The story is passable for as far as I watched but the dialog eventually gets out of sync with the video and I stopped watching past that point.  It seems very unprofessional to the point that I begin to wonder if this might be fan sub or bootleg.,1415318400,2,246,4.125
8571244,2,B00BMZYM2Y,"I ordered this movie twice and both had no subs at all, even though I went to the set up menu and turned them on.",1411776000,,113,3.56
8571245,3,B00BMZYM2Y,I have been a fan of macross for only a little while and by far this is my favorite series because of licensing issues and stuff people cant get a great quality of english sub and thats just a shame since this is such a great series. I really like the story but I cant give this product a 4 or greater because of the bootlegging style sub midway through the series the timing is off and then the songs later in the series are not subbed and they are an important part of the story. Also the cover art on my discs that I have received don't all match. Two of the discs have the Frontier cast on them but the other two I have no idea who those characters are and the case they come in doesn't separate the discs they are stacked on top of each other and I had to order a separate four folder disc case and steal the cover art from this case to use.,1397952000,2,846,3.953216374269006
8571246,2,B00BMZYM2Y,"I have ordered this series twice. They changed the cover but not the quality of the Discs.

Don't get me wrong this was a GREAT series... BUT halfway through the series, the timing of the subtitles were off and the 'songs' in the series were not subtitled, this took away from the story, the songs play an important part of the story.

The Movies were subtitles were only slightly better.",1397260800,,388,4.5285714285714285
8571247,3,B00BMZYM2Y,"Yeah, we all know, that Harmony Gold owns the rights and there has been a lot of debate, but this is what happens, when you don't release the things, that people really want to buy -- you get a bootleg with all the stuff. I don't like the idea of bootlegging something, but people deserve to see this show - it's a blessing!",1396396800,2,324,4.158730158730159
