which has the same region code as U.K. blu-ray's region B
amazon's product description says it's region ABC, well that's wrong

8761102,4,B01FMFKPRA,"GREAT 3 MOVIE SET OF CRONENBERG FILM'S.  BACK OF CASE SAYS THESE ARE REGION B ONLY.  BUT I AM ABLE TO PLAY THEM ON MY REGION A, NTSC FORMAT, SONY BLU-RAY PLAYER HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.  THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE SHIVERS BLU-RAY DISC.  THIS IS THE CENSORED, R-RATED VERSION, OF THE MOVIE.  THAT'S  A SHAME.  PROBABLY THE SAME CUT OF THE MOVIE ORIGINALLY USED BY ARROW VIDEO FOR THEIR REGION B RELEASE,  BUT THEY ARE NOW REPLACING THE CENSORED FIRST PRESSING DISCS WITH AN UNCENSORED 2ND PRESSING.  IT'S TO BAD THIS RELEASE IS STUCK WITH THE CENSORED VERSION.  ALSO ON THE SHIVERS DISC,  THE MOVIE INTRO BY DAVID CRONENBERG, LISTED IN THE EXTRA FEATURES, DOES NOT PLAY.  BUT, ALL IN ALL, THIS IS A GREAT FIND FOR  THE CRONENBERG FAN.  HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE CRITERION WILL RELEASE SHIVERS HERE IN THE U.S. IN AN UNCENSORED VERSION.",1469145600,12,841,4.52
