4197604,5,B003UESJII,"Sylvain Chomet's ""L'Illusioniste,"" based on an unproduced screenplay by Jacques Tati, is a worthy follow-up to his Oscar-winning ""Triplets of Belleville,"" even if it is a gentler, less flamboyant work than its predecessor. ""L'Illusioniste"" is the story of Tatischeff (Tati's real name), a magician in 1959 Paris, who finds his old-fashioned hat-and-rabbit tricks in ever-diminishing demand. Forced to take a gig on a remote Scottish island, he entrances Alice, a young scullery maid who believes his tricks are real. When Tatischeff leaves to accept an engagement in Edinburgh, Alice stows away on the boat. The bulk of the movie is about the chaste, father-daughter relationship between Tatischeff and Alice, and their inevitable estrangement as Alice discovers the bigger world on her own.

Because ""L'Illusioniste"" is based on a screenplay that was meant to be a live-action film, Chomet's animation doesn't take Disneyesque liberties with the laws of gravity and physics. There are jokes and gags, but they are low-key and almost always included to make a serious, even melancholy point. (At one point Tatischeff stumbles into a movie theater showing ""Mon Oncle,"" thus allowing him to come face-to-face with his doppelganger on the screen.) Tatischeff is one of the last survivors of a dying world, the world of the music hall, and we see his world constricting even as Alice's grows. Yet life and happiness go on, as symbolized by the drunken, kilted Scotsman who shows up in places both natural and unexpected. (Be sure to watch the credits to the very end; as in ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" Chomet has a little surprise for us.)

There is not a single computer-generated image in ""L'Illusioniste,"" and Chomet's hand-drawn panoramas of Paris, Edinburgh and the Scottish coast will take your breath away with their pensive beauty. ""L'Illusioniste"" is an animation for adults; it contains nothing children shouldn't see, but the themes and emotions it explores are not those children would understand. It is gentle, thoughtful, and exquisite.",1298764800,25,2048,5.279141104294479
4197605,4,B003UESJII,"This animated hand-drawn cartoon was very nostalgic of certain older forms of entertainment like music hall where a lot of comedians were born. Chomet is drawn to late 1950s Scotland,its ever-changing weather,its beautiful old streets and buildings. His luck was in when Jacques Tati's daughter,Sophie,handed him a script her father never got round to filming,and as a Tati fan he leapt at the chance. His earlier film Belleville Rendezvous was a masterpiece of animation,owing something to the spirit of Tati's France. What better homage to the great comedian film-maker than to make the central Jacques Tati character,the illusionist-stage magician,Tatisceff. He's obviously having a hard time competing with brasher acts like emerging rock stars,who steal his thunder and any potential audience.

He's forced to accept increasingly obscure assignments in fringe theatre,garden parties,cafes and bars. He meets a young chamber maid,Alice,in an island pub,where he performs,but even there they have just installed a juke-box and find this all the entertainment they need. Now I see some reviewers have cast aspersions on this relationship. They travel away together to his other venues as she wants to learn all about magic. But if you frame this by the autobiography of Tati, you'll see it in a different light. Tati had a remarkable relationship with his own daughter,calling her his `little crab' up to her age of 27. He regretted his daughter's change from a girl to a woman,as he had missed her in those growing years,when he was away working. He used to write her long letters. This script is a love letter to Sophie. You see the central relationship as more father-daughter,it was possible in those more innocent days. Tatischef is shown buying her dresses to build her confidence and flowers.

This was a lovely hand-crafted film,capturing the quirky zaniness of Tati,especially on stage. It was a kind of travelogue,taking in the highlands, the lochs,the city of Edinburgh is captured in a superb panning sweep,after he releases the crotchety rabbit in the hills. There is a sort of sad melancholy that hangs over it. Alice meets a young man and they start dating. She is shown changing from a girl to a woman. But I loved the train rides and the feeling you get as you traverse the landscape through the train-windows. The beautiful browns and oranges of the colouring,with spectacular compostions. I see this film as a dying breed,an army of illustrators pains-takingly handcrafting the artefact. Each illustrator responsible for a different character,overseen byChomet. Comet took some liberties with the story-line,setting it in Scotland rather than Prague,using a rabbit in his act rather than a chicken. What we have is well worth it. With a marvellous sense of minor characters too,acrobats,ventriloquists and agents.",1298332800,4,2834,5.281596452328159
4197606,5,B003UESJII,"The Illusionist is a beautifully-rendered animated story about a French stage magician, Tatischeff, and his relationship with a young Scottish girl named Alice, at a time when his kind of entertainment is being displaced by the onset of television and rock-and-roll.

Stylistically, The Illusionist will be immediately familiar to fans of Chomet's best-known film, The Triplets of Belleville. The animation is gorgeously detailed, the characters unique, and the story presented with virtually no dialogue, relying on an occasional comprehensible word or two emerging from deliberately garbled bursts of psuedo-language, French or Scottish-English depending on the setting.

Storywise though, The Illusionist is distinctly different from Triplets. While Triplets was imbued with a manic glee, The Illusionist is instead tinged throughout with a mix of sweetness and sadness. The film begins with Tatischeff's stage magician having to deal with a changing world in which his style of entertainment is increasingly less in demand. This is brought painfully home early on when he ventures to the UK for a gig, only to find his act's slot on stage pushed back again and again by a rock-and-roll band's repeated encores for an audience of screaming teenage girls, forcing the magician to go through his pre-act preparations repeatedly. And when the band finally leaves the stage and Tatischeff gets his chance to go on, it is only to find that the bulk of the audience has already departed, leaving only a solitary grandmother and grandson for him to perform for. The scene is at once absurdly comic and yet achingly sad, and portrays in a nutshell what the magician's life has become.

A chance encounter at a gig for a garden reception takes the magician to a small village in Scotland, where in an intimate tavern setting, he performs his act to a genuinely appreciative audience. But even this small victory is not to be left untouched, as no sooner is he done than the tavern owner installs a juke-box, playing records by the same rock-and-roll group that displaced him from his earlier theatrical gig. At the same time though, he meets a young girl who works at the tavern, a naive teenager named Alice, who becomes thoroughly entranced by his illusions, believing them to be real. An exchange of impulsive kindnesses - she washes and irons his shirts; he gets her a badly-needed pair of new shoes, making them appear as if by magic - forms the beginnings of a relationship that prompts Alice to follow him when he leaves the village to head to Edinburgh in hopes of finding work there.

In Edinburgh, a number of side characters are introduced. One of the best features of Chomet's style is how distinctive the personalities of even minor characters are. The two agents who take the magician on as a client are wonderfully done as they work to promote his act; the brief scene where they get him a gig at the local theater is priceless. And as the hotel where the magician and Alice settle in apparently caters to theater people, they meet a number of other performers, including a chatty ventriloquist, a depressed clown, and trio of constantly leaping acrobats, all of whom are facing the same difficulties as the magician.

The ending sequences are achingly sad as the magician faces not only that his way of life is fading but also that Alice's life is just beginning. When the magician takes his cantankerous rabbit and frees it on a hilltop, you feel that he is turning his back on his profession, but it is a later scene on a train where, in an exchange with a little girl who has lost her pencil, that you truly realize he has given up.

But even within the sadness and the defeat, the film does not give in completely.  While the magician leaves Alice some money and a note which says ""Magicians do not exist"", the film suggests that the magician is wrong. In the empty hotel room, a gust of wind through the window causes the pages of a book to turn, casting shadows on the wall of a bird appearing and flying away, a classical image of magic acts. And as we see Alice walking away with the young man she has met, we realize that in the end, the magician has despite his assertion in fact unwittingly performed an act of magic of his own, the Pygmalionesque transformation of Alice from the shyly awkward and drab young girl he first met into a beautiful young woman venturing out into the world.

It's a different film from Triplets to be sure, and while it does not give one the happy ending one might initially have hoped for, it does stay true to itself, reminding us that even sadness has its own kind of beauty that we should not turn away from.  Highly, highly recommended.",1298073600,64,4691,4.774352651048089
4197607,4,B003UESJII,"One of my favorite animated movies of all time is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Triplets-of-Belleville/dp/B0001IN0MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Triplets of Belleville</a>.  Both weird and wonderful, I knew that I had to check out the creators newest foray into the odd cartoon flick - The Illusionist.

Earning an Oscar nomination for best animated feature (beating out the likes of Tangled and Despicable Me), this Illusionist follows a magician later on in his career as he makes his way around Europe with his small one man, one rabbit show. He meets a young girl, and the two form a strange friendship.  The two settle down in an apartment - he works two jobs to support them, and she cleans, cooks, and then gets wrapped up in the finer things in life.  While this is a French film, there are virtually no subtitles - there is almost no dialog at all.

The animation is exceptional and weird, just what I was hoping for.  The story though was depressing, sad, and actually took aim at the current financial crisis in a round about way.  I couldn't believe the dark places this movie went.  While it wasn't blatantly inappropriate for children, I don't think any child should watch it as it basically says ""life is tough, deal with it.""  The end message, which I won't reveal, is tantamount to telling a kid that Santa doesn't exist.  This does not have the rewatchability that Triplets of Belleville does.

The negatives aside, this is a great movie from an animation standpoint.  I would still put it behind Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon as a composed film, but it's still worth seeing if you're over the age of 10.  I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",1297382400,7,1719,4.906574394463668
4197608,5,B003UESJII,"The latest animated film by Sylvain Chomet is based on a script by the late Jacques Tati, who intended the film to be live-action but ended up never bringing the film to fruition. Tati died in 1982 and the script was passed to Chomet by Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff, who died before Chomet's debut feature-length, animated film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Triplets-of-Belleville/dp/B0001IN0MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Triplets of Belleville</a>&nbsp;was released. Since The Illusionist debuted it has been criticized by family members of Tati for straying from his original vision, as well as his original intention for writing the script in the first place. Since Tati is credited with writing the original script and Chomet is credited with adapting it, it is unknown how significantly Chomet altered the original script. Whether Chomet strayed from Tati's script or not becomes irrelevant as we can't judge a film based on what it could've been but for what it is. The fact is, the film exists in its current form and here it is:

The film begins in Paris, 1959 with Tatischeff, the illusionist of the title, performing his act for anyone who will watch on any stage he can find. While not very successful Tatischeff is an effective illusionist, whose only problem seems to be his unruly rabbit. Constantly searching for a stage to perform on, Tatischeff travels to Scotland and meets a young woman named Alice who believes that his illusions are really magic. Following Tatischeff to Edinburgh, Alice takes care of the house while he goes around performing his act. Alice's love for his tricks and his unwillingness to admit to Alice that what he does is all illusion causes Tatischeff to slowly become bankrupt in his attempts to always have gifts on hand to impress the girl with.

Tatischeff is animated to look like Jacques Tati and Tati's persona is conveyed through his animated counterpart quite well. Those familiar with Tati should appreciate this animated version, as well as the scene where Tatischeff wanders into a theatre playing Mon Oncle. The animation in The Illusionist is much more straight-forward than The Triplets of Belleville, but retains a similar look and feel that identifies Chomet as the maker. Like that film, there is very little dialogue and when there is it's usually brief, mumbled, and nearly inaudible. Finally, just as Bruno the dog was one of the most amusing characters in The Triplets of Belleville simply by being a dog, so is the rabbit in The Illusionist simply by being a rabbit.

Chomet is one of the few animated filmmakers able to use their animation so poetically and while Tati was an immensely talented filmmaker who was more than capable of putting his vision onscreen, this film seems very well-suited for Chomet's animated interpretation. While this film may not be a perfect representation of Tati's vision or intent, it is a respectful tribute to both the man and his style. While I admittedly haven't re-visited Tati's films in sometime, Chomet stays true to his style with his use of wide shots, keeping his distance from Tatischeff in much the same way Tati kept his distance from his Monsieur Hulot. Chomet's film may not convey exactly what Tati wished it to, but the fanciful, melancholy it conveys is quite effective.

Through animation, Chomet is able to capture and convey more emotion than his medium should allow. There are directors who would struggle to capture this emotion with a live-action adaptation of Tati's script and actors who would struggle to convey as much meaning with a lengthy monologue that Chomet effortlessly conveys with sparse dialogue. It's a beautiful film to behold, has a lovely musical score, and happens to be one of the most poignant films of 2010.

The Illusionist is a touching, at times depressing, but always effective film that succeeds at capturing the spirit of Tati where it may have failed to capture the message. Chomet continues doing great things in animation and this is another masterful example that truly deserves to be called one of the best films, animated or otherwise, of 2010. Whether you're a fan of Tati, Chomet, or you're new to the films of both, you owe it to yourself to see this film. It's a masterpiece and a wonderful addition to Tati's legacy.

GRADE: A",1297382400,100,4346,5.08835904628331
4197609,5,B003UESJII,"If anyone wants to know the difference between foreign films and American ones - a comparison of ""The Illusionist"" with ""Toy Story 3"" is a good place to start. Both are excellent movies in their own way...but employ very contrasting styles.

""Toy Story 3"" takes some familiar characters, puts them in danger, provides laughs and tears, and ultimately delivers a satisfactory ending.

The ""Illusionist"" is all about sublety.  There is practically no action and practically no dialogue.  Ultimately it is a story about relationships - the relationship between an out of date vaudevillian magician with his lost audience, the relationship of down-on-your luck theater performers living in the same tarnished hotel, the relationship of the magician with a young admirer who travels with him from an outpost in Scotland to the ""big city"" of Edinburgh.

Some might see this as the old giving space to the new...although it is not just about that.  The young girl and the magician ultimately drift apart because their opinion of what is important was never the same anyway.  This is the melancholy in the film.

It is a slow film - totally unlike the bizarre, hectic zaniness of ""Triplettes de Belleville.""  But whereas ""Triplettes"" is a cartoon of sorts, the story played out on film in ""The Illusionist"" is all too real.  People, jobs, and expectations do go out of date...far more quickly today than ever.

I can't say enough good things how fantastic the animation looks on the screen - those beautiful hand drawn watercolors.  Now  ""this"" is a film to get on Blu-Ray just to appreciate the marvelous artwork. In seeing hundreds of animated films...I have NEVER seen an illustrator do such a spectacular job in depicting light - light in every shade and variety - from the harsh lights of an electric bulb, to the golden light of lamps seen through windows, to the flashing red lights of the theatre district,  to the evening light on the moors of Scotland.  For that alone, the film is worth the price.  One thinks of the French impressionists or the Dutch Vermeer in their use of the play of light in their art.

I am convinced that I could see this film twenty times....and if I do so, I will notice new nuances and interpretations each viewing. That's what I expect in a great film. And that is why the movie is worth owning.",1297382400,7,2326,4.775
4197610,4,B003UESJII,"After seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Triplets-of-Belleville/dp/B0001IN0MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Triplets of Belleville</a>, I was ready for another experience bordering in the magical. In some ways, I got what I hoped for. The imagery is beautifully crafted. Although computer techniques appear in a few places, they always serve the painterly sense that comes through in the backgrounds. The characters, a magician and a young girl in his care, come to life and develop in believable ways. It's a real pleasure to see the girl blossom from a country drudge into something like a young Katherine Hepburn.

The fatherly magician changes throughout the film, too. His changes depict a downward slide, an ongoing loss that seems to have no end. This reminds me far too vividly of losses in my own life - the parallels strike just too close to home for comfort. (A scene near the end, where a two-pencil trick turned to one, confessed defeat so much that I almost cried.)

I came away with decidedly mixed feelings. I enjoyed the animation and artwork, and the character development far exceeds just about any other cartoon around. As a purely personal experience, though, I might have done better without.

4197865,5,B003UESJII,"As much as hand-drawn animation is being supplanted by computer animation, there are still artists who know the power of the art form and give us beautiful images that go along with great stories. Sylvain Chomet (LES TRIPLETTES DE BELLEVILLE) has done just that with THE ILLUSIONIST (aka L'ILLUSIONNISTE, and not to be confused with the 2006 Edward Norton film). The story is rather simple. It is about an out-of-work French magician/illusionist who goes to Scotland and meets this young woman who is convinced that his ""magic"" is real. Over the course of the film, you see a friendship develop between them as his livelihood becomes less viable as a means of support and she comes into her own as a woman. Aiming for subtlety, there is hardly any dialogue (intelligible dialogue, at least) and the images are the primary driver of the story. It's also quite touching and heartfelt. You really feel for this aging man who sees the life he's built for himself as a magician grow smaller and smaller as people now go to the music halls to see rock bands instead of illusionists, ventriloquists and clowns. By the same token, the woman has to discover that the ""magic"" isn't what it appears to be and, in a sense, grow up. From a technical standpoint, the animation was just beautiful and a sight to behold. Sylvain Chomet has a very distinctive, impressionistic approach to character design that makes each frame look like it could be a watercolor painting. Also worth mentioning is that the film is based on an unpublished script by Jacques Tati. Although I've yet to see anything by him, the comedic sensibility on display here makes me want to do so really soon. When all is said and done, THE ILLUSIONIST is a mature, wonderfully animated film with plenty of humor and heart that every animation fan should see.",1427500800,8,1813,4.758730158730159

A magician with a bad bunny, trying to eke out a living on the stage, finds himself inexplicably caring for a tag-along teenager.  He lavishes her with gifts he can't afford (he takes jobs that are beneath his dignity just to get her things because.............?).  Their relationship is vague to say the least.  They are total strangers who suddenly decide to live together.  Until she finds someone else to latch onto.

There's very little humor involved; most of it is fleeting (they could have used more).  The characters interact with the use of pantomime and a few unintelligible sounds.

4198007,5,B003UESJII,"Beautifully drawn animation and touchingly conceived, this is a fabulous movie and it is told almost without dialog. Centered around the cultural shift in the late 50's with TV, rock music, and the final death throes of vaudeville as we knew it, this is a bitter-sweet tale of a magician who is just trying to survive. It is very French in its outlook and emotions, but it stays surprisingly hopeful  despite the plot... or perhaps because of it, as our main character brings magic into the life of one person who really believes. His own personal audience who reminds him why he does what he does.

This isn't a fast moving film. And, unlike, say, the The Triplets of Belleville, which is equally odd and wonderful and done almost without dialog, it doesn't have quite enough moments of open humor to get me back often to watch. But it is most definitely worth at least one viewing. I suspect I will return to this again some day to see how my interpretations change as my own life evolves.",1379721600,4,991,4.561797752808989

4198009,2,B003UESJII,"First, let me say the animation is stunning, flawless, breathtaking. A+. However that's just not enough to sustain 80 minutes (which, I promise you, feel MUCH longer).

There's no clear plot here. The Triplets of Belleville was about four charming elderly women and a fat dog trying to rescue one woman's grandson, a kidnapped bicyclist. The story always moved forward, no matter how wacky things were. Here, we just get a mood piece about the death of vaudeville in the 1950s/60s.

An elderly magician meets a young woman (seemingly an immigrant) working in a hotel. She becomes his traveling companion. They settle down in Edinburgh and he proceeds to do his act nightly, in order to support her habit of buying expensive clothes. After he can no longer make a living as a magician, he proceeds to find other often menial and humiliating jobs, all to keep buying her pretty clothing. That's about it.

There is no dialogue, as with Belleville and most Tati films. Where that device worked in the past, it feels hugely distracting here. Far too many scenes require the characters to endlessly mime things they should just be saying, and plot elements are still unclear because of the lack of a simple line or two of dialogue.

The girl is also one of the worst negative female stereotypes I have ever seen on film. I would certainly NEVER show this film to any young girl. She does nothing but covet expensive clothing and guilt the elderly magician into buying it for her, over and over again. Meanwhile she never does a thing for him, except occasionally cooking. She mostly wanders the city, until she meets a handsome man and loses interest in the magician. The message seems to be that a woman's role is to want and buy things and eventually be a wife. We never get the slightest idea of what's in her soul, what her dreams might be - the character is profoundly shallow.

In addition, as people have pointed out, the film is one of the most depressing animated films I have ever seen, with almost every character ending up miserable, trying to kill themselves, etc. It even ends with SPOILER the magician giving up magic and the girl going off to be a wife to a nearly random guy. I can't remember the last time I was left as disappointed and depressed as by this film. Anyone expecting a joyful, life-affirming piece like Belleville should keep looking.",1377129600,3,2361,4.679518072289157

4198052,4,B003UESJII,"""From the director of Les triplettes de Belleville (The Triplets of Belleville), L'illusionniste (The Illusionist, not to be confused with the Edward Norton magic drama) deals with Jacques Tati and his quirky, solitary-minded journey to spread his magic tricks to an age of people disinterested in the form through Scotland. Strange location for an almost silent French animated film, The Illusionist manages to convey you so many emotions and actions of the characters that dialogue is almost unnecessary.

Perfect choice in picking Sylvain Chomet (the director) to do this film as his style reconciles an old-school Chaplin-esque vibe to his dry, mime-like humour complements well with the silent, quirky mannerisms of Tati. The two-dimensional compositions in the animation (especially when considering the design of the landscapes, colours, and cultural schemes of a 60s-like Edinburgh) are exceptional and rival to the best that Martin Rosen done with Watership Down or, in a rough equivalence, the detailed craft done on Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox. The construction of the narrative is more naturalistic and less organised and exciting as Belleville but is nonetheless strong and classic in its form (much like something done in 50s or 60s cinema).

It is a great film to talk to with people unfamiliar with this type of artistically-minded animation and storytelling. Thankfully, for those familiar with Pixar, the element in it is seemingly bliss as Pixar accompanied such European quirks with short films like Red's Dream, La luna (The Moon), and Presto too. In an age where animation dwells to only children and 3D-oriented filmmaking, it is always nice to see something more traditional and hand-made or different (e.g. Persepolis, Coraline, ParaNorman, Alois Nebel).""

PARENTAL ADVISORY: Much of the film is appropriate for all ages with the exception of a potentially disturbing image involving a suicidal clown who almost hangs himself but stops and an abundance of scenes involving people smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol. Also, the relationship between the man and the young woman is merely platonic (non-romantic). There are PG films and even G films that have more inappropriate things (whether it be violence, bad language, or sexual innuendo) than this gentle film.""",1371772800,,2296,5.389972144846797

4198092,3,B003UESJII,"Marred by something of a family feud over whether Jacques Tati's semi-autobiographical screenplay (co-written by an uncredited Henri Marquet) that lay forgotten and unfilmed for several decades was inspired by the illegitimate daughter he abandoned or the legitimate one he felt guilty for ignoring and to whom the film is dedicated (in truth it seems a mixture of both), Sylvain Chomet's followup to Belleville Rendezvous, the beautifully animated L'Illusionniste aka The Illusionist, comes with an excellent pedigree but somehow never quite works.

Despite the role originally being intended for Pierre Etaix, Tati himself is recreated in animated form as stage magician Tatischeff (his real name) with a vicious rabbit that hates him who is forced to travel ever further afield to find work as the dying music hall finally succumbs to the twin threats of rock'n'roll and TV. Tatischeff is at once recognisably Tati and yet not Tati: like its writer, the character is an awkward presence on the sidelines of a world he doesn't quite fit in even in scenes built around him, but he lacks Tati's screen presence and ability to seem as if he had accidentally stumbled into his surroundings. As per Tati's own films, it's fundamentally a silent movie: what little dialogue there is is a mixture of French, English and Gaelic but mostly gibberish that's universally understandable. Unlike his later films there's a stronger narrative spine that sees a poor Scottish girl so enchanted by the gifts she believes he really has produced by magic adopting him and following him on his travels, but while there are amusing moments, like the rabbit stew supper, and some nice sight gags, the heart is never really there, keeping us at a remove. Both main characters are remote and with the few supporting characters either suicidally desperate or casually unscrupulous, it becomes hard to genuinely care.

Many complained that Chomet's adapted screenplay substantially watered down Tati and Marquet's original, which dealt much more directly with the void between Tatischeff's stage persona and the fallible real man as he keeps up the deception that his magic is real to avoid disillusioning the girl, only for her boyfriend to ultimately expose them as cheap tricks. In Chomet's version, she simply starts to outgrow him as she falls in love, the film almost winding down inconclusively rather than coming to a point. Instead the film's pleasures are purely visual: the animation is beautiful and the British countryside and, in particular, the city of Edinburgh beautifully rendered, the camera often taking to the skies and flying around them as if to express the joy the characters never realise. It's a film I'd really like to love, but for all the genuine artistry on display it just wouldn't let me in.",1355097600,6,2799,5.109170305676856

In some ways, I got what I hoped for. The imagery is beautifully crafted. Although computer techniques appear in a few places, they always serve the painterly sense that comes through in the backgrounds. The characters, a magician and a young girl in his care, come to life and develop in believable ways. It's a real pleasure to see the girl blossom from a country drudge into something like a young Katherine Hepburn.

The fatherly magician changes throughout the film, too. His changes depict a downward slide, an ongoing loss that seems to have no end. This reminds me far too vividly of losses in my own life - the parallels strike just too close to home for comfort. (A scene near the end, where a two-pencil trick turned to one, confessed defeat so much that I almost cried.)

I came away with decidedly mixed feelings. I enjoyed the animation and artwork, and the character development far exceeds just about any other cartoon around. As a purely personal experience, though, I might have done better without.

It's a pleasure to watch  It's a well-crafted film that is unlike Disney, Pixar or any animation that has come from Hollywood.  There is a lovely watercolor effect that is very appealing. And the movement of the characters, the lighting, water, and smoke effects, are so beautifully rendered.  The animation after the main character releases the rabbit on a mountain top is so mind-bendingly phenomenal, I had to rewind it several times!

I disagree with some reviews in that the film is ""depressing"". To me it's a sincere and tender story about two lives trying to make it in a changing world. I am glad for films like this where there is no predictable outcome where everyone is happy and rides off into the sunset. This is a movie about change, trust, wisdom versus naivette, the future versus the past, modernity vs. tradition, etc... I find some ""artsy"" films sometimes try to be comedic, tender, but in some post-modern, ironic and sometimes cynical way, with a wink. But what I like about this film is it's sincerity.

At the end of my first viewing I felt so moved by the characters and the storytelling that I had to keep telling myself these are just cartoons, that it's fiction, that they are not real!  The movie is funny at times but more often than not you feel you are a fly on wall peering into the private quiet moments of these two characters. At first I missed the lack of dialogue, but in the end I think the gentle moments are what makes the film stand out. It heightens the fact that the older gentleman and the young woman are from different worlds, speak different languages and are both in a country that neither of them know well. It reinforces the feeling that underneath the constructs of human language, underneath nationality, age, and gender, that humans share a basic level of mutual feelings and emotion.

This is not your 3D, chase-em, neurotically paced movies that is all to common these days. This is not the opposite either. It's a movie that hits you in places other than over your head... like in your heart, corny as that sounds. If I can suggest one thing: you should watch this film that without any distractions and interruptions.  Otherwise the gentle pace, nature, and mood and feeling that unfolds might be easily lost and you might find the film ""boring"". The first time I watched I was cleaning the house, doing stuff and thoguht the film was ""OK"". But I gave it another shot because some scenes were just so beautiful.  I'm so glad I did because it has become one of my top three favorite animated movies of all time!

UPDATE: THE BLURAY version is even more phenomenal on a big screen TV with good theater speakers! In one scene when the girl trys on a new coat, that animators even rendered dust particles floating in the sun rays on the room, something I did not notice on the standard DVD! The BluRay also has special features including how the film was made. The characters are all hand-rendered just like in the olds, cell by cell, just like in the ""old days"".

In its place, the score and sound effects give the messages and feelings in a very successful manner. There is a nice little ""homage"" to Mon Oncle that shows how much of an influence Tati's films are here. Not surprising, considering it's based on a script written by Tati.

While still keeping much of that european art style charm, The Illusionist never goes into the overly cutesy territory Triplets did. It tells a somber tale about the death of magic in the modern age, appropriately by giving a 2D animation in a market full of 3D competition (there is a very symbolic jump into 3D near the end, but other then that it's all 2D).

4198112,4,B003UESJII,"So much charm in this little wonder, `L'illusionniste' is certainly a delightful little film.  From the opening sequence (in charming black and white) to the closing segments with tears welling in our eyes, this little ditty says so much with uttering hardly a word.  Much like 2003's hit `The Triplets of Belleville', `L'illusionniste' is mostly silent, with the sounds of the city and the surroundings really leading the viewer on as they indulge in the simplicity of the film itself.  This tale is of an aging magician.  As he attempts to display his craft for all to see, he finds that he is slowly (or more rapidly) being choked out by the rock stars that the young women scream for.  With his hopes fading as he begins to feel all the more useless, he meets a young woman who is fascinated with him.  He takes an interest in her and soon she is following him around Edinburgh, eyeing him with wonderment as she believes wholeheartedly in his `magic'.  While the minimal speaking can at times dampen the emotional impact, mostly because certain scenes can become slightly confusing, the emotional endearment coming from the two main characters is exciting and enthralling.  This is a beautiful film that addresses the need to grow up and move on, for both the aging man trying to cling to a past he finds solace within and the budding young woman needing to let go of childhood fantasies and become her own person.  At the end of the day, `L'illusionniste' will leave a smile on your face and tears on your cheek.",1318809600,,1518,4.676691729323308

The crude and acidic message nested under the script, is profoundly revealing and hopeless. The illusionist is an endangered species, a profession that has no place in a world like today where the fashioned artist rocker has supplanted it.

There's no time for such charming, the illusion is an old fashioned issue and now the frivolity's the master of the world.

The secondary line of the script is very touching too. With the dissapearance of the illusionism the loneliness is an unwanted guest, although he makes the best he can to rescue the humanity of that humble girl who once falls in love forgets him.

Another train, another hope, another city perhaps will wait for him, although the public will be limited.

4198149,4,B003UESJII,"...but something's missing. Directed by Sylvain Chomet, 'The Illusionist' is an animated film based on an unfilmed screenplay by french legend Jacques Tati. The animation is beautiful, the story is heartfelt (and funny) but unfortunately I had a hard time getting vested in it.

The story of 'The Illusionist' involves an aging stage magician (Tati's ""Hurlot"" character) in 1950's who's talent is becoming less and less appreciated as the times are changing. He happens to meet a young girl who becomes captivated by the magician's abilities. She ends up accompanying the magician and the two start a sort of father-daughter bonding as the magician tries to cover up his dwindling trade by buying the girl lavish gifts.

As with 'Triplets of Belleville', there's almost no dialogue in 'The Illusionist' and the story plays out in a very whimsical manner(though not as bizarre as 'Triplets'). The story also uses every staple of Tati's work, from the sight-gags (which are hilarious!), to the themes of modernization to the mannerisms of the Hurlot character himself. Still, with all of this I had a hard time getting emotionally invested in 'The Illusionist'. It's easy to care about the magician and the little girl (thanks again to the wonderfully organic animation), but there's nothing unique about their situations or the way their story is told. Even the film's emotional ending doesn't feel earned.

'The Illusionist' is still a good animated film, in fact I think I like it more than 'Triplets of Belleville'. It's very much worth watching, especially if you're an animation buff (I actually like the mix of CGI and hand-drawn animation). Unfortunately 'The Illusionist' lacks the freshness and emotional connection to make it a classic.",1307836800,2,1745,5.159010600706714

4198152,4,B003UESJII,"I recently watched this film after hearing a somewhat positive review from by favorite movie review site Spill.com. So I knew what I was getting into based on the synopsis provided. This is a film about a magician who is on his way out and his magic act is no longer appealing to a mass audience, after he meets a girl in Scotland who works in a pub and she becomes impressed by with magical talents which she feels are real.

The story goes on to show their relationship grow as a sort of father-daughter relationship, but this movie will not leave you feeling happy at the end. This is a realistic look at what happens when the magic disappears in a relationship, or similar to when we all realized our father isn't superman and they aren't perfect. This film will make you think about how far would you go to keep someone you love happy. Also to note the animation is incredible, I will likely re-watch it again soon just to look at the detail in each frame.

I have seen other reviews stating how they loved The Triplets of Belleville and then went on to make a comparison to this film because they where directed by the same person. I personally don't like this approach because this film should be judged on its own merits and not held to the notion that this film should be similar to The Triplets of Belleville.

I would rate this 4/5 because its makes me feel sad similar to how Grave of the Fireflies left you with a great story, great animation, but in the end you might be depressed.

4198154,4,B003UESJII,"I did not see this film - Sylvain Chomet's follow-up to the superb musical animation The Triplets of Belleville - in a movie theatre so I'm posting my review later than most. My review is based on the DVD release. There is no reason for me to go into too many details about the film as fellow Amazon reviewer Josh Miller has done a superb analysis in his review of the film. I will refer you to that review for background, etc.

As a reviewer of primarily (but not exclusively) musical and entertainment-related products, I came to this film expecting more of the upbeat tribute to early turn-of-the-(20th)-century vaudeville that Triplets had. While the central character in this film was big in vaudeville, he was still trying to make it a career in the early 1960s when rock and roll was taking over the entertainment business. As Mr. Miller (and many others) have said, this is not an uplifting film. It is - at times - depressing. But there are lots of high quality live-action films about people ""locked in time"" and not moving forward. This one is just one created through animation. This alone, makes it special, and I really enjoyed watching Chomet's use of animation to create images that could never be done with a live action film. No, I won't be watching this multiple times, as I do Triplets, but I'm certainly glad I did watch it.

As for the DVD issue, I have not yet progressed to the Blu-ray system so I was limited to the standard DVD disc in the combo-pack - which contains both a BD and a Standard DVD. The BD contains a ""Making of"" documentary and another on ""The Animation Process"". The Standard DVD contains only the original trailer for the film.

So, yes I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in either creative animation or early 20th Century vaudeville entertainment.

It is the end of vaudeville in 1959. Television and rock and roll artists have usurped the magicians, ventriloquists and clowns. Their world is now seedy rooming houses filled with the aroma of failure. Here a clown tries to hang himself, a ventriloquist who has had to pawn his dummy, finds his hand moving, searching for his lost friend as he lies slumped drunk over a table. In probably the most depressing of all the scenes, the Illusionist of the title, leaves his rabbit out in the field needing him no more.  The look on the rabbit's face, the confusion, the abandonment stays with me still.  I don't think, with all its beauty, that I have ever seen a more depressing  film than this.

I have been watching horror films since I was a kid and have always slept with no nightmares; after THE ILLUSIONIST I could not fall asleep and when I did, I slept fitfully.

4198212,5,B003UESJII,"Any discussion of this film must first have a little background filled in about Jacques Tati.  Tati was the son of a Russian father and a Dutch mother and his birth name was Tatischeff.  Most of Tati's films have him as the main character, M. Hulot.  Hulot's signature props are a rain coat, umbrella and a pipe (noticably missing in this film).  Hulot was also a pantomimist whose gestures kept the dialog to a sparse minimum&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mon-Oncle-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005A8TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mon Oncle - Criterion Collection</a>.  In Tati's films the sound effects also helped to carry the story and add a humorous touch.  The sound track for Mr. Hulot's Holiday<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-Hulot-s-Holiday-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005A8TV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M. Hulot's Holiday - (The Criterion Collection)</a>, for example, took two years to edit.  In Tati's younger days he fathered a daughter out of wedlock  with whom his sister forced him to severe all ties.  There was controversy over the rights to the screenplay which I will let my readers research for themselves.

Now to the film itself.

The name of the magician (Tatischeff) is, in my opinion, Chomet's beginning homage to Tati. To continue and complete that homage there are several things at work.  The choice of screenplay is the first to get my attention.  The screenplay was written in the mid 1950's and some believe it was motivated by Tati's guilt over abandoning his first born daughter and her mother.  This film, I feel, expresses what Tati would have done differently had he the choice.  The magician is also a characature of Tati down to all the gestures and mannerisms.  In this film, too, the dialog is sparse and subtitles are not necessary.  The sound track is also done with the same sensitivity as Tati and helps to carry the story and to replace the spoken word.  When our magician takes refuge in a theater what we see on the screen is a scene from Mon Oncle.  The color pallet for the film is reminiscent of the openning scene of Mon Oncle.  Subtext would have to be the death of live theatrical performance (vaudeville) with the advent of television.  M. Hulot could not come to grips with the modern world.  A furher tribute to the sadness Tati must have felt over leaving a child behind is the melancholic expression on the magician's face throughout the entire film.

In conclusion, Silvain Chomet has created an outstanding film and loving tribute to one of France's greatest comedic actors.  The film is absolutely beautiful in its detail and really looks great in bluray.",1305244800,,2702,5.363420427553444

4198215,5,B003UESJII,"""The Illusionist"" (""L'illusionniste"") is a 2010 animation film directed by Sylvain Chomet, known for ""The Triplets of Belleville"" (""Les triplettes de Belleville""). First, remember that his latest works is totally different from his previous work, an outrageously unique comedy with singing triplets. There is no deadly bicycle racing, either.

The protagonist of ""The Illusionist"" is a down-on-his-luck French illusionist, whose popularity on music hall stage has waned. His magic tricks are not in demand, as the time is in 1959 and the audience prefers a Cliff Richard and the Shadows-like rock band. The veteran illusionist continues to work anyway, eventually landing on a small village in Scotland, where he encounters Alice, a young girl mopping the floor of the pub he temporarily lives in.

Alice believes that the fading artist can really conjure a rabbit out of a hat like a real magician, and follows him to the city of Edinburgh. Not to shatter her illusion, the illusionist does his best, but time is changing and there is not much that he can do.

The film's script is originally written by Jacques Tati. See how the illusionist often moves like M. Hulot while he is performing on stage, being often interrupted by something. Those comic scenes are effectively done, with the endearingly clumsy illusionist and a ferocious rabbit, but the overall tone of Chomet's film, almost dialogue-free, is full of pathos and sadness.

The original script by Tati was set in Prague. The filmmakers decided to change the location to Edinburgh, a vibrant city which serves as something of a character in the film. With a simple story well told, and soft and warm touch of watercolor painting, ""The Illusionist"" is an excellent homage from director Sylvain Chomet, to the great artist Jacques Tati.",1302307200,3,1797,5.1020408163265305
