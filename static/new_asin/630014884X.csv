8078326,4,630014884X,"In 1981, two cult movies from the western world ignited a firestorm in low budget filmmaking, and their reverberations would be felt for years thereafter.  These two titles were George Miller's ""Mad Max 2"" (aka ""the Road Warrior"") and John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York.""  By 1982, ripples were apparent in the presence of such Italian films as Enzo G. Castellari's ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" (aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Barbarians/dp/B0002UB2ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Barbarians</a>) and Joe D'Amato's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2020-Texas-Gladiators/dp/B000MGHAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2020 Texas Gladiators</a>.  After these and a handful of other examples that year came the films that imitated the firstfruits of Miller's and Carpenter's visions, and well into 1983 post-apocalyptic films were all the rage.  These movies were less inspired by the 1981 films as they were near-copies of movies that were already essentially clones.  Thus, a live and active genre of low budget filmmaking was born.

One obscure entry from this era that has unfortunately been lost to time was Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago (who would go on to direct the 1988 Vietnam war effort ""Behind Enemy Lines"")'s ""Stryker.""  Truth be told, many low budget genre films from this time were actually worldwide co-productions, some featuring Americans as actors and members of the film crew.  ""Stryker"" is no exception, and the screenplay is attributed to the American-born Howard Cohen, who would go on to write the popular sword and sandal epics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deathstalker/dp/B00005NOP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deathstalker</a>&nbsp;(that same year) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbarian-Queen/dp/B00005NOP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbarian Queen</a>&nbsp;(1985).  Several American actors appear in ""Stryker"" as well, most notably Steve Sandor and William Ostrander, as the two principle ""Mad Max""-like lone wolf heroes.

On first appearance, this movie is an archetypal example of the at-the-time very popular post-apocalyptic genre.  The storyline itself is familiar to this class of films:  After a nuclear holocaust, the world is an arid, barren wasteland devoid of something we all need to live on, water.  The plot concerns Stryker (Sandor) and Ostrander's quest to protect a colony of good upright citizens and their water supply from a veritable army of vicious nasties intent on seizing it for themselves.

It has often been cited that there was an Italian effort from the exact same time period,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exterminators-of-the-Year-3000/dp/B003TX8Q4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exterminators of the Year 3000</a>, that had a nearly identical plot.  Thus ""Stryker"" is often seen as the lowest form of a clone movie.  To set the record straight, ""Exterminators"" (another movie I'm a big fan of, by the way) did come first, as that one was originally released in Italy on August 13, 1983.  ""Stryker"" followed, but a mere three weeks later, and opened to Italian theaters on September 2, 1983.  So clearly, the movies were in production at exactly the same time, too close in fact for one to have realistically been influenced by the other.

While this genre is by default admittedly a derivative one, it also presents some of the best entertainment I've come across in underground, low budget filmmaking from the early '80s, undoubtedly the golden age for this kind of thing.  ""Stryker"" is no exception.  Just like its predecessors, the action is non-stop, consisting of endless car chases, explosions, and gun battles (including a head blasted at close range), all very well done and staged.  The movie also bears the trademark futuristic heavy metal look, as the bad guys wear black leather bodysuits and eye goggles that appear to have been an homage to the earliest pre-cursor to these types of films, the Roger Corman quickie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000/dp/B00BVGQGU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000</a>&nbsp;(1974).  There is a standard synth-heavy score as well that is totally vintage and fun to listen to.  And, last but not least, what would this type of film be without the presence of some REALLY hot women aggressively armed with rifles and machine guns.  This one really takes the cake on that front, as the colony is aided by a sect of luscious warrior chicks (including Andria Savio, Julie Gray and Monique St. Pierre) that kill many a bandit with their handy bows and arrows.  One very original touch was when one of the lovely girls introduces the loner hero Ostrander to the delights of love and sex for the very first time, in a scene that is actually treated very tenderly and presents a noticeable shift in tone from the movie's otherwise immense body count.

All in all, it is clear that the makers of ""Stryker"" didn't seek to reinvent the wheel with its creation, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romping good time.  As a die-hard fan of these kinds of movies, I found it to be an extremely watchable and enjoyable addition to the canon (as it were) of classic early '80s post-nuke films.  Other addicts of the genre will surely agree and are more than urged to seek out.",1399161600,23,5489,5.860552763819095
8078327,5,630014884X,Water and not a drop to drink...that is until a nomad stumbles upon some babes who know where the source is. Stryker is a good timeless action flick that will make you thirsty!,1332806400,6,176,4.363636363636363
8078328,4,630014884X,"Stryker, a post-apocalyptic Mad Max-esque 80's action sci-fi film, oozes sexuality in the form of hot babes in leather short shorts (one must keep cool in the parched and barren wastelands of the future).  Good guys and bad guys alike drive around in gas guzzling armor-clad muscle cars, motorcycles, and tanks in search of the ever allusive drop of water.  Obviously, there will be no fuel shortages in the future.

My one big question is ""Why the midget desert dwellers who speak an unknown language?""  I'll assume they were the comic relief, or they had to do something with those little brown robes they took out of the dumpster from behind the Star Wars set.

Mad Max and Star Wars are not he only films ripped off here.  The final M60 shoot out scene conjures up visions of Rambo.  Yet, there's something about these 80's B movies I find alluring.  They bring back memories of those big projection TV's and Roach Coach meals I enjoyed while serving in the USN.  Enjoy.",1227830400,12,974,4.649122807017544
