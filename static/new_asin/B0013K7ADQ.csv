8251524,3,B0013K7ADQ,"I have been fostering a basenji and found this to be a good introduction for someone who is considering the breed.  It gives an overview of some of the quirks and challenges with a basenji but does not go very deep.

Basenjis are a delightful breed but have challenges, and anyone wanting to do in depth training won't gain that here.  I also felt it should have gotten into a little detail about health issues unique to basenjis such as hyperthyroid and fanconi syndrome.

Lucy, the basenji featured, is an adorable dog, and it's worth it just to watch her.",1226016000,,558,4.55
