855049,4,6304380941,"Here's the thing about this movie:  He knows she's dead.  A lot of the other reviewers here seem to forget that he acknowledges she's dead but that doesn't matter. She is dead but not gone.  For some people, that statement sounds like some kind of sacchrine line to calm children.  Sometimes it's the truth, though, and that's what this movie is about.

The movie does take itself seriously, but the subject IS serious.  This is a solid movie, it's not a great film. Taking yourself seriously is not the same as claiming greatness.  David Kelly is a capable director and the cast has chemistry and participate in the telling of a good story.  That's it.  It's a good story, and a fine film.",1096243200,11,690,4.544715447154472
855050,3,6304380941,"If you don't analyze this movie, it's great.  But if you do, you realize that it's not more than a series of emotional triggers.  It is one of my favorite movies because I can relate to some of the subject matter, but if you do analyze it, you can quickly see that the reason the story doesn't flow very well is because they were trying to hard to strike such a wide variety of emotional chords, the story-telling suffered and became shallow.
If you want to see a good emotional drama that will have some appeal to just about everyone, this is the movie for you.  If you are going to analize it, you'll be dissapointed.
It's a great story and has a great cast, but something is missing.  That said, if you just want some emotional heroin, watch this movie.",1089417600,2,756,4.340425531914893
855051,5,6304380941,"This film is very moving. It will remind any viewer not to take their loved ones for granted. The film gets you thinking about how to prepare and makes you ask yourself, how will I react when I lose the love of my life. Enjoy!",1060300800,3,226,4.044444444444444
855052,4,6304380941,"This unusal drama takes the viewer to a place where the dead visit their past life. In this movie Michelle Pfeiffer convincingly plays a ghost that visits her husband on moonlit nights at their beach house where she accidentally was killed.  Her husband, played by Peter Gallager, is clearly still hung up over his wife as displayed when he celebrates their anniversary even though Michelle is dead.  Claire Danes plays her emotionally confused daughter that also has issues with her parent's apparent continual relationship beyond the grave. Overall it was a visually stimualting and heart warming movie, that's worthwhile to watch even if the pace is a bit slow at times.",1043452800,,673,5.054054054054054
855053,5,6304380941,"""To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday"" is a compelling human drama that is a masterful potpourri of characters drawn together for different reasons to commemorate a tragic anniversary. The script is superb, well written and echoes other masterpieces like ""The Man With No Face"" and ""On Golden Pond.""  The film is masterfully complemented by James Horner's soaring movie soundtrack score. Those who don't like this film were probably thinking that they were going to see a reunion film starring Bob Denver and Alan Hale titled ""To Gilligan on His 57th Birthday."" And, true, they would likely have been more comfortable with a film where the professor and Mary Ann send out invitations to a surprise party written on dried fig leaves. Or they were perhaps afraid to approach 40 or to dare to remember the ghosts of their lives so passionately and so vividly. Don't mistake Gillian for Gilligan, accept the invitation to take a long look inside and enjoy this film.",1024444800,,957,4.907407407407407
855054,1,6304380941,"Once upon a time, Michael Brady wrote a wonderfully, touching play called TO GILLIAN ON HER 37th BIRTHDAY. It was a story about a man refusing to come to grips with losing his wife in a terrible accident and keeping her alive through conversations with her on the beach. By living in his false world, he is losing sight of the real world and his daughter who is drifting away from him.
It was a simply written, yet complex, story about relationships between people who are still grieving for loved ones and living in the present is worth it for the incredible opportunities that can be found.
David R. Kelly (Ally McBeal, The Practice) disembowels all of the life from a beautiful piece of storytelling and turns it into a very poorly written, poorly acted, Hallmark Hall of Fame special that gives away its dramatic mysteries within the first 15 minutes of the film.
Too bad...My advice: Get the script from Amazon.com...it's under TO GILLIAN ON HER 37th BIRTHDAY and author MICHAEL BRADY.",1024272000,6,990,4.728323699421965

Anyone interested to know how deep some people can be affected by loss and haven't seen this yet I think it was great,

855056,5,6304380941,"Although very much a chick flick and very much lampooned by other reviewers, I found this a very entertaining and deep movie.  Yeah, its a tearjerker, yeah, it has some standard soap opera situations in it, but the interweaving of the returning ghost and the soul searching of the characters might make you take a good look at your own life.  I loved it.",996796800,5,354,4.515625
855057,2,6304380941,"Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) died in a freak accident on her husbands boat on her birthday two years ago. Now a widower, her husband David (Peter Gallagher) is stuck in funk partly embittered and partly delusional about his loss. Caring alone for his daughter Rachel(Claire Daines) in their beachside home on some New England coast, secretly imagining that Gillian is still with him, David's peaceful existence is disturbed by the arrival of Gillian's sister Esther (Kathy Baker, an alum of David Kelley's ""Picket Fences"") and her husband, Paul (Bruce Altman). It's not quite clear why David is supposed to put up with these pests who want to save him by getting him to let go of his late wife (or at least save Rachel from a shriveling existence with her batty father). (Less clear is why Rachel's obnoxious and flirtatious friend remains a constant presence - she's much too adventurous for the shy Rachel, and doesn't find Paul's leery advances any more preferable.)
For a feature film, ""Gillian"" packs less entertainment than an episode of Ally Mcbeal, and fills the vacuum with standard TV wisdom (you've got to let go of the past; it's better to love and lose than never love at all). Director David Kelly centers the film around the gorgeous Michelle Phieffer, but never makes much of her - is she a ghost or is David really losing his mind?  She's not even convincing as a delusion. ""Gillian"" takes itself pretty seriously, but it's thin stuff, dressed up in gorgeous scenery - the beach, the house and even the boat that carries Gillian to her watery end are picture perfect.  In fact, it doesn't take too long before ""Gillian"" begins resembling less a movie than a really long infomercial for J-Crew or The Gap (when one scene cuts to another of Rachel and her friend trying on thongs, you'll know for certain). Even the chatty interplay between Paul and Rachel's flirty friend, which was fine when it stayed light, takes a heavy turn when she serves a nasty rebuff for an advance he hadn't made.  Paul is left to ponder if his safer, and undminished existence really beats his brother-in law's bereaved widowhood. ""If life were a truck"" he asks Esther afterwards ""is it better to let it run over you to let it pass you by?"" It's actually a beguiling question, but not one the rest of the script does any justice - only a hint of what could have been a better movie, and a loss really worth mourning. Esther's response is good - probably too good. (The flick had the choice of giving her a trite answer that might actually explain this self-important film, or one gets some laughs, and its choice shows where the scipt's priorities really are.)  In short, neither very insightful nor imaginative, an uninspired flick that passes in the night like a wraith.",992476800,4,2765,4.730290456431535
855058,4,6304380941,"I'm a sucker for summery, ""beachy"" movies--especially ones taking place in New England!  Besides the great scenery and summer nostalgia, this movie offers a look at a young girl's (Claire Danes) coming of age.  Not only does Dane's character have to deal with first love and the haunting memory of her mother who died two years before, but she must also sympathize with her widowed father whose been left traumatized by his wife's death. Overcoming death, though, does not turn this movie into a sad drama.  There's plenty of laughs along the way, including Peter Gallagher's reaction to his daughter dating a boy with a pierced nose (played by Freddie Prinze Jr.)  There's also a cute karaoke scene and for the male viewers there's Claire Danes in a thong. Claire Danes is excellent in this movie, as usual!  If you're in the mood for a day at the beach, stay home and rent this instead!",982108800,5,888,4.703225806451613

That said, what I watched came across as very real.  There have been reviews that bemoan the lack of drama.  That's what struck me most about this movie is that it wasn't overly dramatic.  Not every story requires hysteria to succeed.  There is a large portion of our society who's family dynamics are reserved and restrained.  This is not to say that there are no intense moments.  There are but they appear at the right moments when limits are pushed beyond the reserved and restrained.  The characters came across as ordinary and very real.  I've seen a lot of death in my life and generally avoid movies like this but came across it channel surfing.  It interested me enough to find an upcoming broadcast so that I could watch it from beginning to end.

855297,1,6304380941,"B Grade movie, really poor script.

Bulk of movie is boring, superficial, stereotypical.

Real purpose of movie is Baptist condemnation of the supernatural.

Story line.

The wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit. The husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife.

On the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life.

Overtones.

The leading man is depicted as unstable, self-centered, reckless, irresponsible, and fantasy-prone.before and during the two year period. When revealed to the those assembled, the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned. His ""giving up the ghost"" is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life.

The daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head-on crash with a car.leaving her frightened and distraught.

Media Messages.

The film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo.

1. Spirit contact is dangerous, selfish, and emotionally unhealthy.

2. The personal grieving journey of another should be co-opted by peers.

3. Condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact. There should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like ""What did she look like?"" ""What kinds of things did she say?""

4. Messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted.

In short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones..

In life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us. In passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond. When William Blake's brother passed, he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all.

Many near-death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves. The inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds. The same is true for after-death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film.",1128729600,7,2386,5.0152284263959395
855298,5,6304380941,"An easy to watch drama (with some comedy) that is sweet but thankfully not the ""over the top sweet"" these kinds of movies often become. It's a simple engaging story that is very easy to relate to since the movie tackled subjects like loneliness, moving on, and connections in an amusing and ultimately heartwarming way.

Peter Gallagher stars as David who after 2 years of his wife's death Gillian (played by the gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) due to a boating accident still cannot seem to accept the fact that she's gone. In fact when no one is watching he still interacts with her dead wife like she was still alive. That causes a conflict with his daughter who was having a hard time dealing with her mom's death because her father doesn't seem to acknowledge that her wife is already dead. Kathy Baker played Gillian's sister who wants to take her daughter since she doesn't think that David was capable of raising his daughter.

Peter Gallagher gave a great performance. He gets to butcher the song ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"", compete with a nine year old in building a sand castle contest, and he gets to play the heartbroken man who was so in love with his wife he doesn't want to let go. It was a great part for him. Claire Danes once again showed her sensitivity as an actress as she realistically portrayed the aches of her character. Michelle Pfeiffer in a semi cameo role was luminous, in the few scenes she was in she lights up the screen like a goddess.

Towards the end of the movie, the supposedly rational Kathy Baker and Bruce Altman after giving lectures on practicality, responsibility etc. and how talking to your dead wife is silly, were both secretly jealous that they don't have that kind of passion for each other.

It's those kinds of moment that elevate this film into just another romance movie.

855299,5,6304380941,"This is a fantastic film, from the writing to directing to the score to the acting. Peter Gallagher is superb in conveying the torment and guilt felt by a widowed husband. This is a situation that occurs all over the world all the time-losing a loved one is probably the most trying event that any person can ever go through. It's perfectly paced. David Kelley is such a great writer, it's just a joy to let him take you on this ride.

People compare this film to the play too much. They're completely different, theater is much more dialogue, film much more visual. I read the play after seeing the movie first, and although I'm always tainted by what I see first, I still feel the film is better. The characters aren't shallow in the film-they're just what's needed for how many of them there are.

I can't imagine what it's like to lose someone you love. I'm sure I will someday, but after watching this film you'll see how it can drive someone nearly mad trying to move on with their lives. A beautiful achievement.",1114560000,9,1019,4.473118279569892
