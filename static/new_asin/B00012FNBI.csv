1966549,5,B00012FNBI,"Kundalini yoga is different from hatha or power yoga. It moves differently with alot of spine flexing and twisting to get your energy flowing. This combined with a breath called breath of fire makes it work very quickly. I feel completely renewed and energized after just a few minutes of this tape. Something I have never experienced with any of my other yoga tapes(and I have many!). In fact, I have learned that the breath of fire is more aerobic then aerobics and it speeds up the benefits of everything you do. It is really worth it to learn.
This tape is fun to do and I don't get bored with doing it every day.
This type of yoga seems to have a more spiritual element too then other types and I really that.
If you are looking for a workout that gets everything covered. I can't reccomend this one highly enough!",1073174400,11,819,4.394736842105263
1966550,5,B00012FNBI,"I usually watch a dvd through at first to sort of prepare myself for what follows but with this dvd I found myself on the floor during the very first set chanting and flexing, twisting and breathing.  This is definitely not the same old yoga. This was  fun to do! It felt very liberating!  I couldn't believe how good it felt to move my body in new ways.  And the breathing definitely gave me a buzz. Afterwards I felt a vibrancy I  haven't felt since I was a kid. I also felt calm and clear. This is definitely how a good yoga class should make you feel! The Four 20 minute segments are great and makes it very convenient since I don't always have a whole hour and twenty minutes to practice.  Ravi Singhs directions are very clear and precise and his comments are very inspiring.  Ana Brett is an amazing yogi. I love watching her. Its great to see the poses done they way they are meant to be done. Its almost like a meditaion just watching her!
This style of yoga, kundalini yoga, is what I have been looking for but never knew about until now. It not only gave me a complete physical workout, I felt it gave me a great inner workout as well!
This seems suitable for any level. It didn't seem easy but not too daunting either. I was able to do every exercise as given but alternatives  were offered for each more challenging exercise.",1070755200,25,1338,4.302788844621514
1966561,5,B00012FNBI,"I am a Certified Hatha Yoga Instructor, 500 hrs and a registered Kundalini yoga teacher, 200 hrs and I swear by Ravi and Ana's DVDs. for the last few years I make it a point to start my day with one of their DVDs and boy are they transformational! If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class. I am writing this review after experimenting with their DVDs for a few years so be rest assured that they work. Follow these basic guidelines on my blog to keep injuries at bay;

1966562,4,B00012FNBI,"This is one of RaviAna's earliest productions and it shows.  The production quality is very low, and for that reason, I waited a long time to try and acquire this practice.  However, I was delightfully surprised with it.  I especially love the warm-up and open-up and use it often as a mini-practice all on its own.  It is one of their longer practices at 80 minutes; however, it easily lends itself to being broken up into sections.  Plus, if you don't like the set, remember that Kundalini is mainly done with the eyes shut, so it is a small factor.",1360195200,,551,4.47
1966563,5,B00012FNBI,"This is one of Ravi & Ana's earliest DVDs, and it's a great one. We get to see Ravi in this one, the workout is in four parts (though not with the Matrix option, which would be a great upgrade), and the individual exercises are unique and very effective.

There is a warmup, followed by a core strengthening section, then a cardio/radiance section, then a wind-down and thyroid section to end the workout. Any of these can be done separately for a 20-minute session, or you can do two or more (you have to go back and choose each one individually), or choose them all in sequence.

As always, the instructions and demonstration are excellent, clear, and easy to follow, and the workout is pure Kundalini, very effective, energy-building and not exhausting.

Check this one out for a basic workout that covers all the bases and is fun to do, healthy, and invigorating!",1327968000,7,867,4.65359477124183
1966564,5,B00012FNBI,Another great DVD of RaviAna. If you do one of their DVDs daily you will change for the better very quickly!!,1318377600,,109,4.238095238095238
1966565,4,B00012FNBI,"I own all of the ""Raviana"" dvds.  Out of all of them, this one is the one I reach for most.  I do the ""warm up and open up"" section (about 32 minutes) at least once a week.  It's perfect...not too tough, not too long.  Good breath meditation at the beginning.

Frankly, I can't remember the last time I did the other 3 sections...I'm sure they are great.  But Warm up and Open up is my ""go to K Yoga workout"".

Highly recommended.",1312848000,2,430,4.108433734939759
1966566,5,B00012FNBI,"The Yoga Total Tune-Up by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett is one of the more strenuous DVDs I have purchased from them, so it is titled accurately. It is a wonderful workout that will leave you feeling like you have done so much for yourself.  What a gift.

Try it on a day that you have a lot of energy - or would like to get some energy and let it wake you up all over.",1277337600,8,364,3.776315789473684
1966567,5,B00012FNBI,"I'm doing this review basically because of one other reviewer saying Gaiam's kundalini yoga DVD with Gurmukh is much better. Well I recently had my hand on that DVD the only thing I could say is, that DVD from gaiam shouldn't even be alowed to be in the same room with Ana & Ravi's. I personally adore Gurmukh's books, but her yoga class? Not as inspiring as Ana & Ravi's, accept for the trees and leaves in the background.

First of all, Ana and Ravi always do a 3 to 5 minutes tuning-in which makes me feel fully prepared, Gurmukh on the other hand gives about 20 seconds tuning-in.

Second, ana's outfit is what a workout outfit should be and Ana gives really good demonstration, and Gurmukh on the other hand wearing that inspiring-but-not-so-easy-to-see-how-she-is-moving robe sitting up there like a buddha watching other while the camera is actually focusing on her.

Third, Ravi's voice is calming and he gives really good information about what you're doing and what is the benifit of doing it, but in Gurmukh's DVD all the moves were to ""open your heart"" and ""good for your body"" and that's it, and as for her airy voice, maybe not bad for everybody but certainly not for me.

Forth, I know some moves of kundalini yoga don't seem to be inspiring and elegant like other forms of yoga to people who don't practise it but Gurmukh's kongfu moves and ""forget about the form"" and ""just like in kongfu movie"" punch is rather weired to a regular kundalini yoga practitioner.

Not to mention that Ravi always tells you to work on the breath and how it should be, which is very inportant in Kundalini yoga, and Gurmukh only tells you the breath of fire while doing it and forget about breath for almost 20 minutes during the DVD. And if you want me to talk about DVD quality, well that DVD from Gaiam has got some great background with trees and stuff but it is lack of menu and got almost 10 minutes of gaiam ad that you will have to skip manually every time. Now which is better?",1250121600,17,1982,4.4944444444444445
1966568,5,B00012FNBI,i love this dvd. i got navel power too. ravi singh has a soothing voice and is very informative throughout. i am no expert at yoga but i found this easy to do and perfect for me to do at home in the mornings. its broken up in shorter sections which i really like. definitely recommend to others. i even got my husband to try it and now he's hooked too.,1244764800,2,352,3.971830985915493
1966569,5,B00012FNBI,"Having just discovered Ravi and Ana's workouts at the beginning of January, I quickly fell in love with Kundalini yoga and purchased most of their tapes. And although I love all of them, I want to stress to people to not pass this older workout by. It's fabulous, and one suited to my current lower-level of fitness.

I currently rotate Total Tune-Up with Fat Free Yoga and Yoga Cleanse. I am able to finish each of these workouts in their entirety; yeah! Total Tune-Up does not have the high production quality of their later workouts, but the exercises leave me feeling energized, stretched out and relaxed. And since I keep my eyes closed for the majority of it, it makes no difference to me that the on-screen views aren't as stunning as their new ones.

I feel like my lower body gets a great stretch and workout from this. It would be well worth your while to invest in Total Tune-Up!",1236297600,19,890,4.521739130434782
1966570,5,B00012FNBI,This may be an older Dvd but please don't let that deter you from purchasing it. This one works your inner and outer body. I always feel so free and happy when I complete this workout.,1236297600,7,184,4.138888888888889
1966580,4,B00012FNBI,"One notch down because of the production quality.  Ravi and Ana's newer DVD's are great quality!!! Only ""Yoga Cleanse"" and ""Total Tune Up"" were of this quality. Ravi and Ana don't change a thing later, still great, but with some enhancements.  Ana's makeup gets better, There is breathing in the voice over ot direct and inspire you., etc. Each successive DVD they put out is better still.  My favorites are, ""Warrior Workout"". The production quality is better yet, and it is a very challenging workout, as are ""Navel Power, and ""Ultimate Stretch"" I love them!  Then there is Fat Free Yoga"" (This is where the production quality is great, and the music is wonderful with each successive DVD), ""Beginners and Beyond"", ""A Journey Through the Chakras"" (A masterpiece), ""Bliss Hips"", ""Dance the Chakras"", ""Beauty Body"".  I love them all, but these are my faves!

About the new ""Matrix"" option on most of their DVD's -- it is fantastic!",1219536000,4,931,4.860759493670886
1966581,2,B00012FNBI,"I am really surprised no one else has commented on this. I own 2 Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVDs: Fat Free Yoga: Lose Weight & Feel great, and Dance the Chakras. I was so drawn into these fantastic dvds due to Ana's vibrant, calm nature, and Ravi's terrific cuing and soothing voice that I wanted to purchase all of their dvds. CAVEAT EMPTOR!! The Cleanse & Purify as well as Total Tune up dvds are overwhelmingly inferior to the 2 I mentioned above. The lighting, staging, directing and whole ""feel"" of these dvds can't compare. I even emailed their site to let them know. Has anyone out there found the same thing? I can wholeheartedly recommned the 1st 2 I mentioned, however. They are an ecstatic and vital addition to my practice.",1216771200,6,731,4.503759398496241
1966582,5,B00012FNBI,"Ana and Ravi's yoga DVDs have spoiled me for all other yoga discs! Before trying my first one of their discs I had been doing vinyasa flow yoga for almost ten years, with the occasional dabble in power yoga. I had tried a couple of other kundalini discs and hadn't liked them particularly. These are different. They really work your spirit and your body.

This particular disc is divided up into four parts, each about 20 minutes long (Though I think Part 1 is longer and Part 4 shorter.) Part 1 contains a breath meditation and warmups, Part 2 focuses mostly on the core (naval center= belly workout), Part 3 is further workout for the body, and Part 4 slows you down and works your emotions/takes you through final relaxation and meditation. The whole thing is about 80 minutes, and I'll either do Part 1 , 2 OR 3 and then 4, or do everything depending on my time constraints. You can sorta tell, after seeing the others that this and Yoga Cleanse are their first DVDs (slightly lower production quality and a little rougher), but it doesn't take away from the experience at all.

These DVDs have tightened up my body a lot and help calm my mind. I can't recommend them highly enough. I anticipate new Ana/Ravi releases like crazy.",1216166400,8,1233,4.54954954954955

1966585,4,B00012FNBI,"I bought this DVD as I not only wanted to loose that extra 20 lbs Ive put on over the years;but also to focus on my overall health and flexability.
My day is shot if I do not do the warm up and open up,and I have felt the benifits so much that I try to do most of the DVD everyday, my lower back no longer hurts when bending or lifting, I do not have menstral cramps anymore, I no longer suffer from neck pain at the end of the day and I am consious of my breathing and how my body works, and I like that Ravi explains each movments benifits and that the flow is easy to keep up with unlike some of the other DVDs Ive tried where I just could not get ino any flow.  The poses are simple enough for everyone to modify to be able to benifit from, yet there is plenty of room to improve your poses as you you become more flexable. The downside...it works the lower body some (the frog is great!)but if your wanting to shape up your legs and gluts in a shorter time I say get a DVD that focuses on it, I did, but I will not do it without doing the the ""total tune up"" open up and warm up,the streching in it makes all workouts more effecitve, this DVD primes your body for all workouts! the downside.. I get up an hour early and find I have to skip through some of the meditation between sets and skip the burn baby burn(it is more of arobic set and not a target set except for frog pose which I do then skip the rest of that set if on a timeline)as if you do the entire DVD you are talking an hour and a half. I plan to buy more of their DVDs to keep improving as anyone who works out knows our body will hit a plato after a while, but I will continue to do this DVD and mix it up with their other DVDs.",1212019200,8,1700,3.8295454545454546
1966586,5,B00012FNBI,"I'm a very fit person who has been working out for 15 years. I'm not very flexible & practice yoga to help me keep the SLIGHT flexibility I have, and have always preferred Pilates until I found Kundalini Yoga, particularly Ana & Ravi's. The first dvd of theirs I tried is the ""Beginners and Beyond,"" which is fantastic. I wanted to give this one a try to see if it would bring any new challenges. I was THRILLED to find there is no repetition here-- Ravi & Ana present all new poses & methods in this one, so it isn't like I have the same dvd again. They present some of the more challenging poses here (like boat pose, etc), so I have found this one more difficult, but I just love it. I'm thrilled that it's just as challenging as the first, but not at all the same. Kundalini is usually for a more intermediate/advanced yoga practitioner, so seasoned/advanced athletes will be challened with this one just as much as the intermediate. I would suggest starting with their ""Kundalini for Beginners and Beyond"" for an introduction to the breathing and the general idea. I look forward to coming home from work and doing this workout!!",1200960000,6,1134,4.509708737864078
1966587,5,B00012FNBI,"I am a declared kundalini yoga practioner and much thanks to Ravi and Ana.  I did not start with this dvd, but rather with the ultimate stretch, the fat free and now I have collected them all.  however, I loved the other dvds so much, it did take a few months for me to get around to do this dvd: split into 4 sessions that you can do all in one go or separately.  Total time including meditations is about 180 minutes.  I loved the whole program, a great workout and thoroughly loved the benefits.  Great for beginners as you get a complete awareness of kundalini practice and great for those who have been practicing for a wee while.  Dont be put off that this is an earlier production as you will get the same great benefits as the later dvds.  If you have used Ravi and Ana's tapes for a while you don't really pay much attention to the visual but rather listern to Ravi's voice, which remains the same.  Even if you are new to Ravi and Ana, the production is still great, and you'll end up collecting all of them anyway.",1196035200,7,1025,4.247422680412371
1966588,5,B00012FNBI,"This type of yoga is absolutely awsome.  Ana and Ravi are such an inspiration.  I feel exhillerated after doing this workout.  I realy feel like I am doing my body good and have actally began eating much healthier since starting this workout. You feel so good after doing this DVD you WANT to eat better.  Some other reviewer compared this DVD to Shiva Rea.  Shiva Rea is good, but I do not feel as good after doing Shiva Rea and with Shiva I am always looking at the clock and I feel bored.  there is no boredom doing Ana and Ravis DVD.

1966591,5,B00012FNBI,"I have recently begun to do all yoga as fitness. I had been doing a pretty high-impact workout routine 6 days a week. Now I do yoga instead for 6 days. I do mostly Ana Brett & Ravi Singh yoga workouts. I really like their type of yoga because it feels very aerobic. It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.

The only other thing I do, which is something I have always done,  is walking at a fairly good pace. I live in the city and take about 2 twenty minute brisk walks to the subway and back and then walking to do shopping. I am beginning to think yoga is all I need.",1148169600,16,827,4.0

The workout is always fun and interesting. Makes me wonder why so many yoga DVDs have to be so boring! I like the music and the workout is challenging. It is also perfect if you have a hard time following workouts on DVD. You can practically do these workouts with your eyes closed.

1966593,5,B00012FNBI,"I am a walking testament to this type of yoga. I began years ago with an old tape of Ravi Singh's (which I don't even think is available anymore) called Long Live You. I have long since worn it out. I now own all nine of Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs DVDs and continue this practice everday.

You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person. I feel at least half my age if not less. I would not even dare tell people my real age since they would laugh, thinking I am joking.

1966595,5,B00012FNBI,"When I first began practicing yoga at home with DVD's, Yoga Total Tune UP quickly became one of my favorites. It provides a thorough yoga workout for your entire body with a particular focus on your breathing. Ravi Singh's voice is very calm, and Ana Brett is very strong and limber.

This is not the same old, same old, same old yoga practice. Thank God for something new or I may have given up on yoga!

I still enjoy this tape now that I've been doing it for awhile; it's both relaxing and energizing and very effective.

I am on my 3rd copy, I have loaned the other ones to friends and they wanted to keep them.  This and Ravi & Ana's Beginners & Beyond are the number one DVD's that I recommend to those new to yoga.",1141948800,24,721,4.202898550724638
1966596,5,B00012FNBI,"I recently got hold of this one and I am so glad that I did. I had put off buying it because of reviews which spoke of Ana's near naked body. All I can say is that it must be all sour grapes. While you can see a hint of Anas nipples. I don't think I would have even noticed if they had not had so much press!

Ana is beautiful and I think she can expect a lot of arrows slung her way. It is unfortunate. This DVD is a classic. The workout is first rate. The demonstration(by Ana)is first rate. The voiceover by Ravi is also first rate.

I like Ana's almost goth/ almost japonese makeup. The way her hair flops about as she performs with perfect precision. The lighting. The blue and pink set. You also see Ravi make a rare appearance at the beginning and end of the workout.

No matter what type of yoga you do, what level you are, or even if you have never done yoga. I highly recommend you buy this one.

I am only sorry I did not get this one earlier. I now have a lot of catching up to do!",1131494400,23,993,3.925373134328358

They are consistent in their presentations and I was motivated to purchase 3 more DVDs just for the variety and the calmness I felt after doing this workout.  Ravi is so calm and he explains what you are doing and most importantly WHY you are doing it. In so many Yoga videos you hold pose after pose, but the teacher does not explain why or for what reason the pose is important.

This tape has some moves a person doing aerobics would recognize, but Ravi explains how they benefit your maridians or how it cleanses your organs etc.  A simple neck roll now becomes something I want to do because it has value on so many levels.

I got up a sweat with this tape, but did not find it particularly difficult, except for the Frogs, man those are challenging.  I plan on incorporating these DVDs into my weekly practice.  I find them a refreshing change to your typical down dog, up dog routine.",1130976000,49,954,4.3559322033898304

This yoga DVD combines cardio, strength, flexibility, balance, and toning in a vigorous and enjoyable workout. I love the pace, the exercises, Ravi's cuing, and  and Ana's form and energy. I always feel that it's time well spent and I certainly feel it the next day. If you're looking for a program that leaves you worked out, energized and on top of the world this DVD is the one to buy.",1130198400,15,476,4.471264367816092
1966599,3,B00012FNBI,"When reading the reviews for this DVD, I was perplexed by how many I read that said ""Wow, great! Five stars!"" and conversely, ""Totally sucked, don't waste your money."" I was all mixed up about whether or not to buy it and decided what the heck, it's only 20 bucks, try it and see. If you are in a similar situation, I hope my review helps you make an informed choice.

I'll start with what I liked. I liked Ravi's instructions and speaking style. He's very relaxing and encouraging, pushing you gently on but not making you feel like a failure if you can't. The poses were very well executed by Ana Brett; it wasn't difficult to be sure if I was doing it right. The music was interesting and paced well with the poses. I especially liked that there was a brief meditation/relaxation session after difficult poses. This helped me continue even after I probably would have quit if it weren't for the little breaks. Doing the whole DVD is quite a workout, challenging you but not completely wiping you out or being so difficult there is no way you can keep up.

There was really only one thing I didn't like, and because it was so completely unnecessary, I took off at least 1.5 stars from what I would have given this DVD otherwise. Ana's nipples and areolas are plainly visible throughout the entire DVD. Her clothing is absolutely inappropriate and distracting. Several times during the workout she has to pull her shorts down because her bottom has squeezed out of them. I am a very laid-back person about nudity and am not offended by much; Ana is a beautiful woman and deserves to have that beauty appreciated. However, the plain view of her breasts through her top and her bottom through her shorts was so unnecessary that I was inspired to complain about it here. The editors could easily have airbrushed the areolas out or put her in a darker outfit. Also, Ravi makes a few fantastical claims (""Prevent wrinkles!"" as you turn your head from side to side) and promotes rather dubious health benefits from doing this form of yoga.

If you're interested in this DVD for weight loss, this will probably be a good one. I have started yoga as part of a weight loss program myself and will probably do this particular DVD often. If you have a lot of weight to lose as I do, try not to be discouraged if you feel bulky and ungraceful at first. Modify the poses as best you can and stick with it. Your body will respond to the love you give it and with consistent practice, you'll see a difference (so the yoga gurus tell me).",1125014400,48,2523,4.480434782608696
1966610,5,B00012FNBI,"I have purchased about 15 different Yoga videos over the past couple years and now I have finally found the ultimate.. no need for any other.. one! It's a moderately-paced workout that is great for beginners or intermediates.

 Someone recommended this one to me for fertility and I am happy to say it worked! I am now 3 months pregnant and hoping Ana & Ravi come out with a pregnancy tape. I know there are other pregnancy workouts out there but no one else will do!

Ravis  voice is very calming and he relays many positive thoughts throughout the entire video. Ana is a very glamorous inspiring person and instructor. People complain about her outfit being to small but I didn't notice it at all. I suspect people are threatened. She comes across as very sweet and unassuming.

Overall, if you are looking for a yoga video that shapes you inside and out and energizes and delights  with 2 very genuine/ cool instructors BUY THIS VIDEO NOW!",1123632000,12,942,4.610778443113772
1966611,1,B00012FNBI,"You have got to be kidding me! I read the reviews about how great the DVD was. I was shocked to plainly see the nipples of this woman under her white top throughout the whole DVD.

Wow, what a shocker. No class at all. Do we really have to see a belly button or nipples or too short shorts while doing Yoga for he 30 or 40 minutes. I do not want to see that crap or pay for that either.

Really, is there any reason for that in YOGA?

Not unless you are the husband of this woman. I have to say, what a strange way to present YOGA. The music, what music? The guy's voice was terrible. The look on his face with his eyes rolled back in his head while his half-naked wife is doing yoga behind him.........what is he doing?

I can not imagine giving this DVD as a gift unless I never wanted to see that person again! I did get another DVD, ""Warrior (something or other)"".  The clothes were better, but the music and the white light this same woman was sitting and exercising on...Oh brother...I think they watch to much of....you get my drift.......Spiritual or Sexual? I am not sure what it was!

I figure that if you like this dynamic duo's other videos you will most likely love the DVD. You have be warned!",1122940800,18,1207,4.181034482758621
1966612,5,B00012FNBI,"My wife and I wanted to learned kundalini yoga and finally found a local friend who had practiced it for years and promised to help us.  He recommended the DVDs by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett.  We immediately found that this DVD was so good that we did not need an instructor.  We started started almost three months ago, have lost weight, feel immensely better and only suffer on the rare occasions that we can not do our yoga.  We still use this DVD as our guide - although we sometimes lengthen the sessions.  It improves your moods, health and you suddenly find that ""bad"" foods don't attract or taste good any more.  We now have three other DVDs from Ravi and Ana, but this one remains our favorite.  It is perfect for beginning and going to the intermediate level, or just when you want to relax and feel good.  (NOTE:  We are in our late 50s and now feel 10 years younger.  We now give this DVD as gifts for our closest friends and every single one has raved about it.)",1120694400,12,973,4.2967032967032965
1966613,5,B00012FNBI,"The Total Tune Up is a moderately paced workout that will give beginners and intermediates a perfect workout. I have purchased all the most popular Kundalini DVD's since I fell in love with this type of yoga and I have to say this is the absolute hands down winner.

Ravi Singh who does the voiceover is excellent as well. His voice is very calming and he fills you with many positive thoughts throughout the entire video. Ana Brett is very inspiring as she performs the exercises with perfect execution.",1116201600,8,504,4.662921348314606
1966614,5,B00012FNBI,"My Kundalini Yoga instructor friend recommended this DVD to me to introduce me to Kundalini Yoga. Since I like to get a good workout rather then meditate I have always stuck to Power Yoga and Cardio at the gym both of which do not thrill me.

I am so happy to have discovered this workout. I love that their are no down dogs and  some of the other typical and to me ""boring"" yoga poses.  You do alot of repetitive movements for a good amount of time. It really keeps you moving. It is exhilerating. You do alot of breathing which makes you feel very fresh, clean and high afterwards. The instruction is easy to follow. You don't have to look at the screen all the time.

I feel like this DVD has deepened my practice many levels.

Ravi & Ana are big time instructors who have taught stars like Madonna and Sting. They are the real deal. Even if you don't like yoga or exercise in general, I think you will like this one",1115942400,5,919,4.228571428571429
1966615,5,B00012FNBI,"I'm not sure if this is actually based on anything or if anyone else will agree with me but it seems that even a little consistent Kundalini yoga (like an Ravi&Ana section every day and maybe one longer session on the weekend) helps me more with weight loss than even really intense traditional cardio or toning.

This Total Tune Up Yoga Tape is a classic. I would recommend this to anyone interested in this form of yoga.  It is a great introduction. It is also a great total workout for long time Kundalini practioners.

This one will definitely help you to gain some serious strength/endurance:There is warming up and breathing which feels amazing and there are these moves that move so fast - crouched down like a frog, to standing , crouched to standing, over and over again - for about a minute. BRUTAL. I lasted 15 seconds. There is also  a really great ab workout included. Its Total!

This tape is broken up into 4- 20 minute sections. Which is perfect for me.

Ana is perfect to follow. And Ravis voice is very soothing.

Thanks R&A. Please make more!",1115856000,11,1061,4.552631578947368
1966616,3,B00012FNBI,"This DVD doesn't hold a candle to the Gaiam Kundalini DVD.

It's a decent workout (great ab workout in the second segment), but if you are looking for a superb Kundalini yoga video, get the Gaiam Kundalini Yoga video with Gurmukh.

Ravi Singh has the WORST music in this video, it sounds like background soap opera music from the 80's, and the see-through white sports bra of the lady in the video is not necessary.

Also, the backdrop is boring and Ravi's narration sounds very bland and scripted.

I guess I have just been spoiled by Gurmukh's video.",1114128000,17,552,4.6020408163265305
1966617,5,B00012FNBI,"About 1,5 year ago the person I go to for SHIATSU , started to attend Kundalini-yoga-classes in Amsterdam.

 He became very, no, extremely enthousiastic and soon he started to teach me a bit at the beginning or end of the shiatsu. And so I started reading about Kundalini and got through him my first Kundalini tape, and soon after I bought the Ravi &  Ana Total Tune Up and Yoga Cleanse DVD's.

 Now I bought the newest DVD's and I am  thrilled with the new workouts!

The Kundalini yoga helped me very much to get out of a very serious depression, to structure and motivate me at the beginning of the day and also to overcome the side-effects of the medication I took.

 It also helps me to keep my lower back in shape because a hyper-mobility off my spine causes me severe back-problems when I meet stress.

The Kundalini-fever infected my life in such a positive way that I am gladly spreading the virus under my friends. The excellent DVD-work-outs are so clear and easy to follow, that it's a very nice way to do yoga on your own when you wake up in the morning.",1103068800,10,1068,4.375634517766497
1966618,5,B00012FNBI,"Just returning to my yoga practice after 12 years away, finding this DVD by Ravi Singh & Ana Brett was an amazing gift.  There are four twenty minute sets. If I just want to limber up I can do just the first 20 minutes. The middle two sets are more vigorous, lots of breathing and energetic movements. The last set has more meditation.

What I really like is the clarity of instruction ie.,the clarity of Ana Bretts form. Does she ever make a mistake?

The instruction is gentle and supportive and Ravi has quite a few very profound and touching things to say.

I feel like I have my body back and some new insights too.  I am now purchasing this one and their new ones too as gifts for friends and relatives.",1101859200,9,709,4.3007518796992485
1966619,4,B00012FNBI,"This is a good kundalini yoga practice and I would recommend it, as well as the work of Erin Kamler (Mantra Girl) as a supplement to any yoga practice.

There are some odd elements to the DVD.  First of all, Ravi Singh is in the DVD, but he is not actually doing anything.  He appears in a lower corner of the screen, which is a bit distracting.  Ana Brett is performing the routine in what appears to be her underwear.  The music is tinny and repetitive, which can be irritating as the 90 minute routine stretches on.

Notwithstanding these comments, it is a good routine.  The routine is designed to cleanse body and mind, therefore it does not really have the same physical results as a power or ashtanga yoga routine would.  The biggest advantage of kundalini yoga, however, is that it is all about breathing so there really is no ""cheating"" possible.  Many modern yogis and yoginis practice yoga without paying much, if any, attention to their breath.  This creates a system whereby the practitioner is possibly increasing flexibility, but not much more.  This practice will leave you feeling energized, alive and free.  If you can transition this breathing focus to your other yogic practice, it will be quite beneficial to you.

Please do not get wrapped up in the ""fat burning"" benefits of yoga.  Anything that causes one to breathe intensely will burn fat, be it running, dancing or yoga.  Yoga, however, should not be viewed totally from the weight loss experience as it likely will not meet one's expectations.",1100649600,6,1521,4.751908396946565
1966630,5,B00012FNBI,"I tried Kundalini Yoga in LA about 5 years ago and it was just to weird. We did something that resembled deep knee bends for 10 minutes while doing some sort of heavy breathing.

A couple months ago my friend insisted I try this DVD and to my pleasant astonishment I really loved it.

Its a yoga workout that works all parts of the body. I get my stretching, ab work, and cardio covered in the four 20 minute sequences. When I do it, it saves me a trip to the gym that day. Also,I am the last person in the world who would sit down at home and meditate. But now I actually look forward to it.

Every exercise on this DVD uses breathing in interesting ways. It makes me mellow and energized at the same time.

I definitely notice a big improvement in my body and in my life.",1100304000,6,773,4.099337748344371
1966631,3,B00012FNBI,"Between 3 and 4 stars. I own a number of yoga tapes mostly Hatha and Ashtanga style yoga, such as Power Yoga with Rodney Yee and Total Yoga with Tracey Rich and Ganja White.  After reading about and then subsequently practicing Kundalini yoga from books, I wanted to purchase a Kundalini yoga DVD.  The exercises are very solid- frog pose into straight leg position done quickly, leg lifts pumping up and into chest, slow cobra poses up and down and with breath of fire, leg lifts, headrolls, contractions and arched back from pose of nobility, etc.  I did really like the Burn and Affirm section.  The pranayama breath work is very good and all is executed wonderfully by Ann.

What I didn't like about the tape was:  the side stretches from leg to leg are done too fast given the lack of warmup into them.  There is a potential for injury unless people slow it down until they feel stretched enough to go at the pace in the DVD.  I also really didn't like the music, very drum and bassey, in a distracting way, and without much versatility to make it a good drum & bass track.  Also the filming quality is so so and Ravi Singh talking, although sometimes good information is annoying in a patronizing kind of way. I'm glad I got a Kundalini DVD so I get perspective on the pace the exercises are done, but I don't know if this is the best.",1095206400,20,1341,4.396761133603239
1966632,5,B00012FNBI,"This series of 3-DVDs are wonderful. They include individual segments for a quick workout or you can do them together for a longer practice. Ravi Singh has a very soothing voice. You work hard, then rest and meditate. This type of yoga might not be for everyone, but give Fat Free Yoga a try. Ravi Singh talks during the instruction and for 2 of the DVDs visual instruction is performed by Ana Brett (his current wife). The other DVD is demonstrated by Catherine Quinn.
Also, if you get a chance to attend one of Ravi Singh's / Ana Brett's workshop it's well worth the money. They came to Portland before I got their DVDs. It was a fun and rewarding workshop. I went out a bought all the DVDs after that and I'm practicing Kundalini Yoga along with my Hatha Yoga practice every day. Thanks Ravi!

1966633,5,B00012FNBI,These are not like other yoga DVDs. There is no logical sequence of static poses like other methods in which I have trained. Here the workout almost feels like playtime with its ballistic vigorous energetic movements.  There are times when you can recognize something close to a regular asana but nothings ever static. I love it! I realized that my other practice had been making me more tense. These workouts are a breath of fresh air. Ravi Singh is a very good teacher. Very intelligent with an inspiring flow of  talk. Ana Brett is an excellent model and moves like a dancer. It is a joy to have them in my living room! The emphasis is on the breathing. There is a warm-up and stretching on both tapes I have (yoga Cleanse and Total Tune Up). And meditation too. I also like how you can break things up though so far I haven't had to. I recommend these.,1078012800,6,856,4.4113924050632916
1966634,5,B00012FNBI,"I got 3 kundalini dvds for christmas: Fat Free, Total Tune Up, and Yoga Cleanse.  This is my introduction to kundalini yoga.  Its really different from the yogas I have done.  You are moving, flexing, and rotating, breathing all the while.  I like to alternate my workouts so I can do another one everyday.
The first thing I noticed was that even if I started my day tired or with a headache I would end it elated and pain free and with a good sense of self.  I think the secret is in the breathing not only for your body but for your psyche. I have always been a creative person but I was never able to just let myself be an artist.  It may be a coincidence, but since I have been doing these tapes I have been making art like I never could before and have the confidence to call myself an artist.
The instructors in these tapes are quite good.  Ravi Singh is like a fountain of wisdom and Ana Brett is like a nymph or a sprite. I get a kick out of watching her do yoga.
All the dvds can be broken into segments which I like.
I recommend these tapes very highly.",1074211200,10,1063,4.081730769230769
1966635,5,B00012FNBI,"I love Kundalini Yoga and I absolutely love this new series of Kundalini DVDs and Videos by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett called Fat Free Yoga. I have been practicing this form of Yoga for years and have always found Ravi Singh an excellent teacher and dedicated Yoga master. I own many of Ravi's earlier instructional videos and have always found them the perfect way to enhance and sharpen my Kundalini study. Ravi's teaming up with Ana Brett has brought these DVDs and Videos to an even higher level. Her form is amazing and precise. She is strong without looking like she lifts weights. My girlfriend and I practice along to one of the DVDs every morning when we get up. We usually rotate our workouts going through each of the 3 DVDs (1 a day) and then starting them over again. After we finish we are always charged and ready to face the day. We have both taken off weight due to our daily practice along to Ravi and Ana's instruction. Both my girlfriend and I have more energy and are sleeping better also.
For those new to this form of Yoga, Kundalini is different from other forms. It is an all body workout and therapeutic practice helping your organs as well as your muscles, skeletal structure and mental well being. It will actually help to remove toxins from your body, from organs like your liver and kidneys. Following the instruction on these DVDs and Videos give my girlfriend and I a total body workout.
I recommend the complete Fat Free Yoga series by Ravi Singh and Anna Brett without hesitation.",1073865600,8,1512,4.5625
1966636,5,B00012FNBI,"I have been a dancer in a ballet company for the past 10 years. My dance training led me to Iyengar and Power Yoga which seemed to be an extension of my dance training emphasizing precision and exactitude. It wasn't until I experienced Kundalini yoga that I realized what flexibility really is.
Flexibility is freedom and the ability to let go, Its less about holding the pose and more about moving your energy (and that of course, moves your life!)
One important aspect of kundalini is it's unique use of breathing. After doing either of these Ravi Singh/Ana Brett dvds I feel totally revitalized. I have finally been able to quit drinking coffee which has been my energy crutch for years.
Kundalini yoga has increased my confidence and artistry, my energy has opened up. Other people have commented on it. Its a wonderful feeling to open up and express myself in new ways!
Ana Brett, who demonstrates in these is obviously a dancer and inspiring to watch.
Ravi Singh gives good direction and motivation and valuable insights throughout.
I have been recommending these dvds to everyone - dancers and nondancers. Whoever you are - you will get benefits from this.",1073520000,17,1163,4.82

I stumbled into this one and when I went through the chapters I noticed an absolute discrepancy with the run times for each and every chapter. The description says four 17-minute workouts, while the actual run time of each is:

1 - Wake up & Open Up - 32 min
2 - Firm & Afirm - 15 min
3 - Burn Baby Burn - 12:45 min
4 - Raise Yourself Up - 16:21 min

I've found that constantly the run time in the premixes in many of their DVDs is totally wrong, sometimes by 10 minutes or more. I wonder why it's so hard to provide a more accurate figure for the runtime of the session, but other than that I think every RaviAna DVD is worth doing over and over again.",1428364800,,753,3.8516129032258064
