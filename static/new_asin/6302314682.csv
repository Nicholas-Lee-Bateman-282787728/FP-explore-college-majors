7824667,4,6302314682,"I would have given this tape 5 stars had it been recorded in SP mode and had more than 30 minutes of cartoons on it!

The few cartoons are:

1) (George of the Jungle) THE MALADY LINGERS ON - Shep the elephant is sick but the witch doctor's perscription is hazardous to George.

2) (Super Chicken) THE WILD HAIR - A mad scientist's living toupee runs amuck!

3) (Tom Slick) THE SWAMP BUGGY RACE - Dirty cheat Baron Otto Matic disguises himself as a lady to bug Tom in the Ira K. Dismal Swamp Buggy Race!

4) (George of the Jungle) THE DESTERATE SHOWERS - When the Bumbashootie witch doctor decides to sacrifice Ursala to Juju the rain god, George puts a damper on his plans!",1147737600,2,673,4.309523809523809
7824668,4,6302314682,"This (less than 30 min) tape appears to be a single episode, or thereabouts, of the original TV series.  You get two episodes of ""George"" and one each of ""Super Chicken"" and ""Tom Slick"".  The ""George"" episodes are merely ok; as is the case with most of these they simply don't measure up to the fantastic insanity of Rocky & Bullwinkle.  Its the ""Super Chicken"" and ""Tom Slick"" episodes that make this tape; they are as good as any of of the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" interlude cartoons.  I'd recommend this tape (at the right price) as a good place to start for fans of Jay Ward cartoons who are interested in this part of his career.",1111881600,,632,4.422413793103448
