7391408,4,B014G08OC0,The DVDs arrived as expected but it did not include the tote bag. It's not a big deal since it's the DVDs that are important and my kids love Peppa Pig.,1450310400,,152,3.935483870967742

7391414,5,B014G08OC0,This is a great deal for 4 DVDs. Love these because they play 4 or 5 episodes back to back and when it gets to the end if you don't do anything it will start all over from the first episode.,1459900800,,190,3.658536585365854

7391417,5,B014G08OC0,"My daughter absolutely loves Peppa Pig and these DVDs were a perfect choice for her. All four DVDs came as described with the bag included. Each is full of many episodes and she loves to play them ""on the big tv.""

7391420,5,B014G08OC0,"Great DVDs and my son was extremely happy when we surprised him with these!  At first I thought the blue tote was left out of my package like so many other reviews mention but after opening the package of DVDs, I realized the blue tote bag was folded up to the size of a dvd case.  Very happy!",1457654400,,293,4.0344827586206895

7391422,4,B014G08OC0,"Love this! got this for my daughter last Christmas and she has been watching it non-stop until we finally got an amazon fire tv where she could watch the online videos which is good because she watched these dvd's too much that one of it started getting bad and freezes sometime in the middle. It has a lot of mini episodes included in each dvd and overall, my daughter and i loved it and was worth what we paid for it!",1457049600,,419,4.185185185185185

7391424,5,B014G08OC0,"Just as pictured!  Ours did include the tote, and it was cheaper to buy this set than buy each of the DVDs separately. You can never complain about Peppa -she's just too darn cute and funny!",1456012800,,190,4.277777777777778

7391427,4,B014G08OC0,Our shipment also did not include the tote bag.  While I am not overly upset about getting the bag I think the listing should be updated to list just the dvds.  Saying the bag come with the dvds is untruthful.,1454198400,,209,4.2

8730624,4,B014G08OC0,"My kids love the videos.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because two of the dvds had cracks in them, however, they still worked so I didn't bother returning them.",1479859200,,187,4.194444444444445

8730628,5,B014G08OC0,"If you have a young child who loves ""Peppa Pig"" this collection of Peppa DVDs is worth its weight in gold!  My granddaughter will sit quietly and watch these DVDs and loves them so much that I have to limit her on the number of episodes that I play because she would quietly watch them all day if I let her.  They come in handy if you need to have the child sit quietly while you make dinner or just to get some calm, quiet time. The DVDs are just like the TV program, but there are about 15 short episodes on each DVD, for about an hour per DVD. Since the DVDs are a collection of different short episodes, you can start and stop them at any point. Believe me, if your child loves Peppa Pig, you will be thankful to have these DVDs on hand.",1463270400,,741,4.034013605442177
