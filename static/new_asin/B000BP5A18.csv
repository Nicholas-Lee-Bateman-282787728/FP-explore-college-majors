8090385,5,B000BP5A18,"This Amazon listing describes a standalone DVD edition of Aki Kaurismaki's 1988 film ARIEL, but you're better off getting the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criterion-box-set/dp/B001BEK8F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criterion box set</a>&nbsp;where ARIEL is linked with two other films in a ""Proletariat Trilogy"".

ARIEL is centered around the trials and tribulations of former miner Taisto Kasurinen (Turo Pajala), who heads for the big city after his mine is shut down. Once he reaches Helsinki, he starts a typically Kaurismakian (and typically Finnish) love affair with Irmeli (Susanna Haavisto), but stable employment proves elusive. Eventually Taisto winds up in jail, and his escape with cellmate Mikkonen (Matti Pellonp) drives the remainder of the film.

Even this early in his career, Kaurismaki's art had accumulated some stock gestures. There's a guy getting attacked and left for dead, romantic rendevous that are awkward and employ a bare minimum of words, and a juxtaposition of modern times with classic cars and 1950s music. Nonetheless, ARIEL holds its own and I rank it highly among the Finnish auteur's films. Comparing it to the other two films in the ""Proletariat Trilogy"", ARIEL is more serious than SHADOWS IN PARADISE, but less bleak and joyless than THE MATCH FACTORY GIRL. In fact, ARIEL proves a very balanced film, thanks in part to Matti Pellonp's masterful performance which blends tragedy and comedy in an utterly convincing way.

8090387,5,B000BP5A18,"Aki Kauraismaki gives us a powerful feature of his beloved Finland, with a bitter gaze inspired by Dostoievskian visions, blended with a visible minimalist style that brings us back to those years of the Italian Neo-Realism.

The story is about a lonely and hopeless man Taisto Kasirunen, who loses his job and additionally sees how his best friend commits suicide, leaving him as inheritance some money and a gorgeous Cadillac;  and decides to make his own trip, along the arid and cold landscapes oh his natal country. Along this mesmerizing road movie, he will attacked by two thugs who almost murder him, after stealing all the money he had, but (the first cynical accent) leaving the car.

For these destiny' s trickeries, he will meet the woman of his dreams Imerla, and after being sent to prison, he says : no more from now I will make the rules of game.

And Ariel will be for him, his personal Ithaca along this personal Odyssey.

I love this movie with special affection, and it's included among my two hundred cult movies ever made.",1190937600,,1044,4.714285714285714
8090388,5,B000BP5A18,"Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki made many films during 80s and 90s and ""Ariel"" (1988) is one of his earliest. It is made with confidence and original style that has made him one of the most famous and unique filmmakers today.

The simple story follows a coalminer Taisto (Turo Pajala) living in northern Finland, who has lost his job and his father too, the latter having committed suicide in front of him. Taisto drives a huge white convertible to the south seeking for job. In the city he meets and falls in love with a middle-aged traffic officer Irmeli (Susanna Haavisto), but that does not stop the downward spiral of his luck, and he finds himself in prison for what he is not exactly responsible.

Using the conventions of old Hollywood film noir with his minimalist approach, Kaurismaki has created a curiously enticing world of his own, where a convertible travels with its roof down in the cold snowfield as if it is nothing unusual. His story is shorn of all sentimental moments. Characters act very clumsily. Moreover, they don't speak much, nor show emotions, apparently, but what they feel can be felt under the dead-pan faces of actors. Kaurismaki's regular Matti Pellonp as Mikkonen, Taisto's partner is a stand out. It is sad he passed away in 1995. He was only 44 years old.

""Ariel"" is part of the films Kaurismaki would make about the ""losers,"" followed by ""The Match Factory Girl"" and ""I Hired a Contract Killer"" (both in 1990). His film is acquired taste, not for everyone, but if you like his more recent films ""The Man without a Past,"" those films and ""Ariel"" is a must to see.",1190332800,,1601,4.690391459074733
8090389,5,B000BP5A18,"This is the best road movie ever.  It is, in fact, one of the 100 greatest movies of all time.  I am totally bummed that no one has put it out on U.S.-compatible DVD machines.  I just may have to move to Norway ...",1167868800,,214,3.8181818181818183

I enjoyed every Kaurismaeki movie, but this one is definitely the best.",1157587200,,248,5.358974358974359
8090391,5,B000BP5A18,"""Ariel"" is as funny and deadpan as the best movies from the great Aki Kaurismaki. The hero is a victim of unfortunate circumstances, starting with his being laid off from his job as a miner, and continuing  during his quest for a better life, both in work and in love. In typical  Kaurismaki fashion, he reacts with the same expression (very little) to  catastrophic events as he does to minor occurences.
When our hero meets  up with Matti Pellonpaa (""Leningrad Cowboys Go America,"" ""La  Vie de Boheme"") about halfway through the film, they say nothing to  each other, but a great partnership begins, taking us to the end of the  movie. This movie has quite a bit of action, by Kaurismaki standards. And,  as usual, there are no wasted words. Dialogue is at a minimum here.
With  ""Ariel,"" the masterful Kaurismaki gives us social commentary,  human drama and comedy all at once.",961113600,11,879,4.723684210526316
