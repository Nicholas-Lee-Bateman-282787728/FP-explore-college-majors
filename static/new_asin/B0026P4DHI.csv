8353349,5,B0026P4DHI,"Being a mother of a preemie baby, I loved this documentary. So many parts of it hit home for me. I wish we could have watched this before our baby was born as I think it would have helped to shape our perspective of both the delivery, NICU stay, emotions and (importantly) what to expect when you get home. This isn't as much about the babies' medical stories (as it mentions, every micropreemie is different), but it addresses the side of what parents can expect & maintaining a long term perspective. It was so, so good. I highly recommend it.",1400112000,,545,4.46
8353350,2,B0026P4DHI,"Little Man by Nicole Conn is a much better very informative from the doctors , parents and all the info on a baby Nicholas born a 100 days early at one pound now 11 years old. Nicole also has a awesome book out about micro preemies as well as a sweet sound track of soothing music from the documentary that was on HBO .",1380240000,2,319,4.0
8353351,5,B0026P4DHI,"I have worked in the neo natal intensive care unit for almost 30 years now and cannot say enough about how much I loved this documentary!  The stories are real people who come to life and share their intimate experiences.  I have yet to watch it without becoming teary (I've seen it more than once and I work as a nurse)! I appreciate the candor and warm hearts that are expressed by the families.  The discussions by the health professionals are illuminating and well done.  This is a great piece of work to share for staff at meetings, for new staff as well as a glimpse for families of staff into the stories behind our work.  There is nothing like families talking to families, so this is also so great for any family who has ever had or has a baby in the NICU to view.  I often feel that as a nurse I am educating my patients family and I know what lies ahead for them is familiar territory but to have someone else who has gone through it with their own blood and tears, well, there is no comparison for that kind of support.  This documentary is crafted as a gift of love to all who view it!  My thanks for it.",1378080000,4,1117,4.186915887850467
8353352,5,B0026P4DHI,"This film give a great depiction of the emotional impact of having a micropreemie.  I plan to use this film for my nursing students to give them an understanding of the scope of the problem, and the impact it has on families. Very well done.",1376784000,2,241,4.355555555555555
8353353,2,B0026P4DHI,"This documentary is comprised of interviews with parents of micro preemies about the feelings involved in giving birth to a very premature baby. I understand that the point of view of the parents of these babies is important, but I was hoping to see more footage of the care, procedures, and treatments of these little ones. The film didn't even draw out the long-term consequences to the babies or families. It was very disappointing.",1363824000,2,435,4.891891891891892
