Doxital can bring the newly dead back to life and grow back severed limbs.  In this film, Eric Shepherd played by Mike Stanley who also wrote and directed the film, has his arm tore off by an unknown creature.  A young woman named Laura, played by Connie Cocquyt, gives him the doxital drug which grows his arm back.  Shepherd uses the doxital drug to pay off a debt.  Unknown to Shepherd, the doxital he gives away is spoiled and turns those who take it into zombies.  Dead is Dead is a thriller with just the right amount of horror and suspense.",1412726400,,704,4.287878787878788
