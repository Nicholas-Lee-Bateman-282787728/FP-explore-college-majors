8002588,5,B0000TEVKQ,"One of the best exports of British has to be the situation comedies, affectionately known throughout the world as Brit-coms.  So popular are they that other nations borrow and adapted the ideas for their own television, as well as carrying over the original shows for broadcast.

Interestingly, this collection of discs from the BBC does not include many of the adapted series, but rather those pieces that tend to be so uniquely British (or so uniquely well done) as to defy 'translation'.  They include many of the greatest personalities in British comedy -- John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Paul Eddington, Rik Mayall, Patricia Routledge and more.

While there will be those who complain (and I am one of them) that their favourite shows aren't included, or are incomplete (so, why is there 'Yes, Minister' but not 'Yes, Prime Minister' here?  Where is 'The Vicar of Dibley'?, etc.), this is nonetheless an excellent collection -- perhaps a good 'starter' collection, that later additions can be purchased to supplement.

There are several shows that are complete, or more-or-less complete.  These include 'BlackAdder', the hilarious romp through British history with the able assistance of Rowan Atkinson and a bit of Shakespeare; 'Fawlty Towers', perhaps the best Brit-com ever, a riot of a hotel stay with the world's worst hotelier; 'The Young Ones', everyone's nightmare of neighbours in somewhat-college-age renters; 'Yes, Minister', the political spoof that is the BBC's satirical answer to Jonathan Swift, once remarked that, even given it was a comedy, that truth is twice as true (and half as funny).  'Absolutely Fabulous', the spoof on modern style, has the first three primary seasons, those that ensured its fame.  'Father Ted', 'Red Dwarf', and 'Coupling' have the first seasons only; and the collection is completed by a portion of 'Keeping Up Appearances', subtitled 'My Way or the Hyacinth Way', and the French & Saunders Collection, starring the comedic powers behind 'Absolutely Fabulous' and 'The Vicar of Dibley'.

This collection shows the length and breadth of British comedy, providing entertainment it might takes months to complete, full of episodes of different sorts that will want re-viewing countless times.  From the bawdy to the urbane, from the slapstick to the witty, sometimes rolled into one, this collection demonstrates genius.",1092787200,18,2397,5.314814814814815
8002589,2,B0000TEVKQ,"I would say that if you were a Britcom fan, this would only tantalize you and leave you wanting sooo much more.  If you really wish to get all the goodies, take the jump and get the full sets.  You will regret not knowing what went on after the first series for these well performed shows of British wit.  Also you should not forget ""The Vicar of Dibley"".  I waited 7 years for them on DVD, and never regreted spending a penny.  Dawn French and the rest of the cast were Brilliant!",1068854400,11,481,4.184782608695652
