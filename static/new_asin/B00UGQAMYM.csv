8706511,1,B00UGQAMYM,"Going in the exact opposite direction of Christopher Reeve's bright and compassionate Superman, director Zack Snyder has created a dark, sullen Superman that appears directly inspired by Dr. Manhattan from 'Watchman'. Filled with character development and pacing issues galore, the bulk of the movie focuses on gratuitous violence as Superman battles General Zod while the latter attempts to transform Earth into an alien ecosystem. Something like gigantic mechanical spider from the Will Smith piece 'Wild Wild West', oddly enough, makes a return as the terraforming engine.

Had I come in with lower expectations, I suppose I would've judged this film less harshly. At the same time, though, Superman as a character is supposed to be a beacon of inspiration and hope. Instead, the film presents him as a burdened loner who feels so separate from humanity as a whole that he has to question whether or not we're actually worth saving. The intense emphasis on images of buildings blowing up as the fighting goes on and on also isn't anywhere near appealing but instead feels pointless. Overall, this ought to be skipped.",1533600000,,1120,5.153846153846154
