8274288,4,B0019KAQAE,"Gives a full explaination and information ""why"" people perform such rituals, and what is expected. I think it was good and very informative.",1362096000,2,140,5.130434782608695
8274289,5,B0019KAQAE,"While I agree with Creole concerning the usefulness of this DVD for someone with prior knowledge of the belief systems discussed within, I feel he was too quick to give the DVD such a low rating.  I showed this to a Yoruban Elder, and he in fact, used my copy to show in his class.  None of the students really knew what Voodoo/Vodoun was all about, and this program provided some very useful information.  I have watched it a few times after the class ended, and I still enjoy watching it.  It was really respectful toward the subject matter, and the people featured within the program.  If you have always wondered about Voodoo, what it was REALLY about, then this is an excellent starting point.",1315094400,6,698,4.552
8274290,2,B0019KAQAE,"This was a waste of money. You will not learn anything unless you don't know anything about basic basic basic African pagan systems.  This isn't even History Channel quality. There is no debt to the information and follows one man-who gets one shower ritual in Africa.  I was under the impression that I would see new and unseen Voodoo rituals but it is a short story of a black college kid, who goes to this camp in S. Carolina and then travels to Africa after becoming a Voodoo priest but the film doesnt take the viewer on a journey and kinda just tells us that this person is now a Voodoo priest but we have no idea of how he got there. This isn't anything that cant be seen on Youtube.
There is also very little background given on the Orishas (Gods) except in quick name mentions. No mention on how to worship these gods or anything of that nature. Waste of my money.",1257120000,5,873,4.317073170731708
