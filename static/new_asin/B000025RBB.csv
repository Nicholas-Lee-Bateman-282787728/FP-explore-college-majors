1250629,1,B000025RBB,"This DVD is about the worst 'video' of a live stage production I have seen in years. The singing is fine enough, the costumes and set design are very fine enough (what we actually see of them!)  Mr. Brian Large who has a long list of Directing for Video numerous stage productions seems to here, at least, take no regard  to what is actually happening on the stage.  He and his camera crew are obsessed with capturing every singer in full head and shoulder CLOSE UP.  No matter what drama is going on the vast stage of the salzburg theater, he is showing every singer in continuous in- your- face Close Ups.  (very often the cameras are not even catching up to the moving actors....but you see them moving out of the frame, or missing the target all together)
He even treats us to loving shots of the BACKS of the heads of the chorus !!!
This is VERY TOUGH GOING.... Sad.  It won't help to  turn the picture OFF and just listen. Several singers sound very off-mic.  Oh, and you have to like hearing them stomp around the stage, cause the floor mics seem to work more than fine for the singers foot steps.  So, If you are looking for that 'You Are There' experience of being in the expansive, dramatic,Salzburg and hearing a huge orchestra ...... you are out of luck here.  Don't buy it.
I cant even watch the second half of this .  Totally ruined by Brian Large. How does this man find work???  (To try and convey the amount of damage that his camera work has done to this production.........here is his name in CLose Up

1250630,5,B000025RBB,"Kurt Weill's opera shows all the worst about humanity: greed, exploitation and an absence of caring. Its message is ""you can't buy happiness,"" and ""carpe diem.""

The performance is quite good. Jerry Hadley simply bursts with energy as Jimmy Mahoney--he's just right, and keeps the story flowing for the entire production. Catherine Malfitano does a masterful job of singing and acting the role of Jenny Smith. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the camera just comes in too close, making us wish she had recorded this a decade or so earlier. With my deep appreciation for her acting and singing talents, I really hate to say that, but Jenny is supposed to be a young girl, and this is just pushing it too far.

You will absolutely devour the scene of ""Fatty"" as he devours meat and more meat to illustrate the human trait of gluttony for more and more out of life. Roy Cornelius Smith has set the benchmark for this role.

Dennis Russell Davies keeps the pep and energy going constantly, to make this a typical ""always-on-the-move"" Weil performance.

The nudity may offend some but it is appropriate for this well-done Weill.",1183507200,,1136,4.84020618556701
1250631,4,B000025RBB,"Right from the get go Dennis Russell Davies has the orchestra playing with

a fine ""Weill"" sound - clean and intense with impressive brass playing as

the strings chug-chug away.  The very opening bars of Mahagonny (especially

when played this well) can really get me going on the ride.

Immediately we're introduced to a hot, doe-eyed announcer who saunters on

and off before each scene and before we know it we're being introduced to

our three fugitives from justice.  As Trinity Moses, the pinstriped Wilbur

Pauley is long and lean and looks just ""too cool"" sporting the sharpest

sideburns in the biz.  R. Cornelius Smith is his complete physical opposite

and together they make a great comedy team while pouring out vocal gold.

Dame Gwyneth appears with her trademark hair and looking hard as nails.

Vocally, her Begbick is worn and the wobble is now so large as to have

become a thing of wonder.  Still, she sings with great conviction and turns

in a gutzy, biting, scathing and memorable performance.

Peter Zadek's production is nothing short of astounding with sets from

Richard Peduzzi and lurid costuming by Norma Moriceau.  The set, beginning

as blank walls colored only by lighting, grows with each scene reaching its

apotheosis as a 30's Holly set of a Babylon movie complete with life sized

statutes of elephants and is most impressive.

Zadek trusts his actors and they in turn seem to trust him right back all

giving inspired performances, down to tiny touches that make all the

difference.  An example:  Begbick, kicking back into relaxation states how

the new city will be all relaxation, no work for anyone.  Yet, as she

mentions this the reality is Moses and Fatty are sweating their asses off

hauling her cargo with all the zeal of a prison work release hand assigned

to paint a factory or clean out a pig sty.  Irony, lies, contradiction and

self deception all go hand in hand in Mahagonny.

As Jenny, Catherine Malfitano's wide vibrato nearly puts her in Dame

Gwyneth's camp, but like Dame Gwyneth here is a consummate operatic

actress, investing everything with passion and she fills the role of Jenny

from teeth to toes.

The quartet of ax-swinging lumberjacks invests the opera with even

more ""real"" fun.  Weill and Brecht have created this foursome with such

craft and inspiration it's impossible not to fall in love with these guys.

One also can't help fearing for their wellbeing as Begbick welcomes them,

trapping them into her spider web Mahagonny.

Marco complains about the ugly voice of Jerry Hadley.  I can't agree.  It's

not a ""beautiful"" voice, but here is a characterization and development of

a role which succeeds on every other level.  I've never been a big fan of

the tenor's, but he gives such a gutsy, mindboggling performance and he

really SINGS the role as opposed to some of the Herodes-style barking I've

heard passing for Jimmys in the past.  The voice sounds free and sizeable

and is deployed with an abandon I'm not used to hearing from this singer.

Hadley also gives a physical performance that is hard to believe: jumping

from table to table, flinging furniture, dancing with his axe, falling from

platforms, slapping whores' asses and dancing his very big heart out.  I

had to make sure it was Hadley!

The scene where Jimmy tries to leae Mahagonny is a most powerful one.  The

boys in peppermint stripes the scene turns into a gay-90's barbershop

quartet before Jimmy jumps into the pit and into the aisles with enough

energy I wouldn't be surprised if he had callbacks for Cabaret  . . . or

Grease!

Former lister (or is he?) Udo Holdorf is hilarious as Jakob Schmidt,

receiving encouragement and cheers as he glutonously prepares to eat his

3rd calf in a row before.  The cheers continue until, meat hanging out of

his mouth, poor Jakob . . . well, you know . . .

There is much to enjoy here:  the boxing match (gruwesome and hilarious)

between Trinity and Joe; ""Pirate Jenny"" with Malfitano atop the billiards

table (some interesting symbolism here), a touching ""Crane Duet"" and Dale

Duesing's performance as Pennybank Bill showing why he's one of the very

best of American Singers - taking a rather small, ensemble role and

creating a genuinely memorable character that touches the heart.

I'm not sure what other videos/DVDs are available of Mahagonny . . . but

they'll have to go a long way before they can touch this one.

Highly recommended.",1095984000,16,4456,4.80106100795756
1250632,4,B000025RBB,"I wish I could get a DVD of the New York Metropolitan Opera version done around 1978 and broadcast on PBS Live From the Met. That one, sung in English, blows this one away. But still, the Salzburg version is better than none at all!",1082764800,5,232,4.177777777777778
1250633,3,B000025RBB,"Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's ""The Rise and Fall of The City of Mahagonny"" is not only one of the most important operas of the twentieth century, it is also one of my personal top ten on a 'desert island' list.  The music is exciting and adventurous, melodic, frantic, descriptive, beautiful, harsh and absolutely unforgettable.
On my first day of video shopping, after purchasing a DVD player, I saw this brand new release of the 1998 Salzburg Festival production directed well by Peter Zadek, conducted brilliantly by Dennis Russell Davies.  The latter obviously has a true affinity for Weill's music:  his recording of the ballet ""The Seven Deadly Sins,"" featuring Marianne Faithful, is certainly one of the best available.
The quality of the picture and the sound on this DVD is, naturally, top notch.  The question, however, must be raised as to whether television cameras are really all that helpful in a medium like opera where the singers sometimes distort their faces and bodies in order to produce the correct tone.  This must be especially strange for a viewer coming to opera for the first time via television tapes or DVD's.  Although the leading performers in this ""Mahagonny"" all have the acting chops to make their characters true and honest and exciting, they also must be true to the music and so we have many close-ups of their faces which, to be honest, are simply unflattering to the point of grotesquery.
Gwyneth Jones, as 'Leocadia Begbick, is still a beautiful woman,  but, since her best career years are behind her, she can no longer handle alot of Weill's music and, thus, resorts to growling; Jerry Hadley as 'Jimmy Mahoney' acts and sings well enough but Catherine Malfitano is, I'm afraid, too mature in voice and body, to play a convincing 'Jenny.'  Two other of the major roles are played by singer-actors who would do this piece proud anywhere:  Dale Deusing as 'Pennybank Bill' and Udo Holdorf as 'Jake Schmidt.'
The designs for Salzburg are evocative, although they seemed to dwarf the actors at times (certainly they are more fitting than the ones used presently by the Metropolitan Opera in New York), the chorus sings well and acts adequately, although I question the use of full nudity. Was this really necessary to convey the sense of a brothel when the music and libretto do so already? The Radio Symphony Orchestra Vienna plays this difficult, wonderful score magnificently under Dennis Russell Davies.  I also wanted to commend the uncredited fight director.  The extended fight scene in Act 2, is one of the best and most realistic of any theatrical fight I've witnessed.",1011398400,23,2617,4.925
1250634,4,B000025RBB,"Although Mahagonny is the probably the grandest of all of Weill and Brecht's collaborations, the Salzburg stage is still a few size too large for any production of this opera. With the help of Peter Peduzzi's simple but gigantic sets, the director, Peter Zadek, tried to fill the stage with quite an amount of action, hoping (not quite successfully at the end) to fill the void. That this recording on DVD makes more enjoyable home-viewing than expected has, to a very large extent, to do with the judicious video direction of Brian Large, who is clever enough to focus the cameras on the interaction between the main characters so that the viewer's concentration will not be distracted by all those flimsy business going on around them.
Among the cast assembled for this festival production, Jerry Hadley stands out as Jim Mahoney. The tenor plays the part with obvious relish, and while he may be belting out at times (excusable given the vast venue of the performance), he sings with ardour and also appears to believe in every word that he utters. This is in every way a dramatically compelling and vocally exciting assumption. Opposite him, Catherine Malfitano also immerses herself totally into the role of Jenny. Yet, the camera is rather unkind to her in a couple of scenes and she suffers from some intonation problem from time to time. Nevertheless, she and Hadley make a fine pair and their duets exude a sense of intimacy, which is all the more welcome in this large-scale production.
The role of Leokadja Begbick is perhaps not too suitable for Dame Gwyneth Jones, for the vocal line lies too low for her. Her voice sounds rather worn at this register, even though she tries hard to make every word tell. Nevertheless, both her handsome stage presence and acting ability have not diminished by the passing years and she is particularly vivid in the Act I drinking scene and the Act III trial scene. Roy Cornelius Smith is a vocally luscious Fatty and Wilbur Pauley offers an imposing yet obnoxious Trinity Moses - a piece of excellent characterisation. Udo Holdorf, Dale Duesing and Harry Peeters are a fine team of friends for Hadley, and Toby Spence is a young-sounding (and looking) Toby Higgins. On the whole, the standard of acting in this performance, taped ""live"" during the 1998 Salzburg Festival (with curtain calls included at the end), is very good indeed.
In the pit, the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra led by conductor Dennis Russell Davies (all dressed in casual clothes, which contrast sharply with the bejewelled Salzburg audience) gives a fine and energetic performance of the score which is both epical in scope and rich in detail. The picture quality of the DVD is very good, but the sound, especially that from the orchestra, is slightly diffused. While there are some imperfections in the performance, this DVD recording does make enjoyable viewing, and can be warmly recommended in particular as there are, at the time of writing, no rival sets of this work on the new audio-visual format.",1004313600,17,3025,4.88715953307393
7915405,5,B000025RBB,"Whereas the Threepenny Opera is set in an imaginary London without landmarks, Mahagonny is set in an imaginary town on the US east coast. Both reflect events in Germany at the time they were written. Mahagonny has a wonderfully melodic score that shows the influence of many popular genres of the period such as jazz and cabaret music, yet it is a very bleak complex, very dramatic work, at times intensely moving. Brecht's text is heavily ideological and full of unrelenting sardonic humour. There is so much to it that any fairly good production will have a considerable amount of interest to it. Whereas the LA production conducted by James Conlon treats the work as if it were an American musical, successfully, this production treats the work as grand opera, also successfully. This production is available in more than one edition. The large Salzburg stage allows for wide screen treatment. The singing is excellent. Gwynneth Jones sings like the fine opera singer she is. Jerry Hadley is very good. The best production by far that I have watched in English is the one from the Met conducted by James Levine at B0064SHXE8. It is really worth finding. The best production in German is likely to be as fine as that by the Komischen Oper, Berlin of 1977, conducted by Robert Hannell with Maria Zahlten-Hall as Widow Bedbick, Elliott Palay as Jimmy (Paul Ackermann) and Tmara Lund as Jenny Hill. But the Salzberg production has much to offer.",1463616000,,1444,4.850202429149798

Jimmy's powerful chorale like number close to the work which is taken up by the ensemble is cut. Part of it is placed in this production earlier on in the work with only the ensemble's section being sung near the end of the work. In the Salzburg production it is kept intact and performed near the end of the work.

7915407,5,B000025RBB,"A strange piece, but nevertheless very thought provoking. An opera that satires the whole opera and makes it's dramatic qualities ugly in a modern sense, bringing more realism and some laughs.

All the performances in this recording are fantastic. Above all, Teresa Stratas and Astrid Varnay (the two vocal queens who reigned in the film version of Strauss' Salome) star as Jenny the Prostitute and the Fugitive Leocadia Begbick respectively. These ladies are lead by the fantastic Maestro Levine, and it's quite something to watch. Their voices are strong, and bring out the dark qualities of Weill's score.

The production is quite dark, and something to adjust to, but it starkly contrasts the actors so the attention is immediately on them. I suggest getting this version, as well as another version from LA Opera (Patti LuPone, Audra MacDonald).",1438387200,,850,5.1521739130434785
7915408,5,B000025RBB,"This CD release comes from a package put together by the MET Opera to honor James Levine on the 40th anniversary of his debut.  Who better to honor, Mr. Levine is, in my humble opinion, the main reason for the Met's glory years during the late 1970s, 80s and into the 90s.  Every performance he led was on a very high artistic level, he built the orchestra into the Greatest Opera Orchestra in the world, a position they still maintain, even after Mr. Levine is no longer at the absolute peak of his game although he continues to improve after his health problems.  The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny was introduced to Met audiences during a period when Levine was bringing lots of important modern works into the repertoire.  Some were successes (Lulu, Dialogues of the Carmelites) some less so (Moses und Aaron).

I am a die hard Kurt Weill fan, both the European and American works.  If any of his work belongs in an opera house, Mahagonny does.  Street Scene is also a good candidate for companies that can handle works with a fair amount of spoken dialogue.  This is a fascinating work, with text by Berthold Brecht, it is one of the strongest pieces showing his distaste for Capitalism.  Not everyone is going to warm to the story of the 7 deadly sins gone crazy in a supposedly Utopian world, but for those receptive to Brecht's point of view, the work has a powerful dramatic arc.

The production by John Dexter who established a wonderful working relationship with Levine and the Met is just about perfect, spare and dramatically detailed.  Highlights include the arrival of Bigbeck, Fatty and Trinity Moses in Florida, the boxing scene in Act II and the storm sequence where the town is decimated.  Levine shows that he understands the Weill idiom, too bad he never conducted any more of his work.
And, finally the cast!  Teresa Stratus is a perfect Jenny, and in fact after this production she explored more of Weill's work which was so brilliantly done that Weill recordings break down into before Stratus and after Stratus, so completely did she impact performances of Weill's music.  Astrid Varnay was a perfect Leocadia Bigbeck with Ragnar Ulfung and Cornell MacNeill as her sidekicks.  Richard Cassilly is in superb late career form as JImmy Mahonney.  He was past singing most of his mainstream roles such as Don Jose and his Wagner repertory but the voice is still in good shape and never has a tenor of his stature sung this part.  His sidekicks from Alaska are Vern Shinall and Paul Plishka.  It is kind of sad to note the presence of Nico Castel as the announcer because he passed away this week and will be missed.  Cumulatively this cast completely outclasses any other cast who has recorded or performed this piece on DVD.  I personally love Audra MacDonald as Jenny (although she doesn't inhabit the part the way Stratus does) and Patti Lupone as Bigbeck from Los Angeles Opera, but the rest of the cast is not in the same league as the Met cast.

Direction for TV by Brian Lodge is brilliant, it looks as good on screen as it did in person, but there are differences.  I know because I worked on the production as Assistant Conductor, one of the greatest productions I ever worked on.

For anyone inclined toward this work, this is a 7 or 8 star version and a great example of opera on film.",1433462400,4,3325,4.6078098471986415

This performance communicates her (and our own) humanity, the tragedy and (otherwise buried) optimism intended in this work.

7915412,5,B000025RBB,"An historic James Levine/John Dexter collaboration was of the Brecht/Weill ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (sung in translation, as ""Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny""), in 1979, with Teresa Stratas, Astrid Varnay, Richard Cassilly, Ragnar Ulfung, and Cornell MacNeil.

This is an uneven, but fascinating, work, and it received the full focus of the Met in what may be remembered as one of its finest eras, when the company was crawling out from under the repressive period of the lengthy tenure of the philistine Sir Rudolf Bing.

Here we have Dexter's nearly-bare stage, with designs by his friend, Jocelyn Herbert, and peopled by curious, decadent characters. (This writer saw a revival of this production in the theatre, in 1984.) In the liner-notes of this recording, Maestro Levine recalls his work with Dexter: ""Our collaboration was wonderfully creative, and several really successful productions came out of it. He was brilliant and yet extremely difficult to work with. But the results were usually worth it, and in my opinion his vision and his philosophy were very good for the Met. At his best he was a great director, and surely his best productions are still classics of their kind."" It was after Dexter's gradual, bitter withdrawal from the Met that the company descended into the gargantuan, gaudy productions of Franco Zeffirelli and his ilk.

The casting here, again, is ideal. Stratas is seen in one of her finest roles, the prostitute Jenny Smith. (Her costuming in Acts II and III is very revealing, however.) Varnay, a great Wagnerian of the previous generation, is a domineering Widow Begbick, wild of voice and committed to the Brechtian aesthetic. Cassilly, with his enormous voice, makes the lumberjack Jim Mahoney a tragic poet. Audiences were accustomed to seeing MacNeil playing the tragic heroes and antiheros of Verdi, yet he masters this role, even to a convincing boxing match with the great Paul Plishka. Another stand-out in the cast is the tenor Arturo Sergi, as Jacob Schmidt.",1325289600,15,2027,5.081081081081081
7915413,1,B000025RBB,"Known in English as ""The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"", Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny by Kurt Weill rates among the worst of the Euro-trash operas. Though Weill has had occasional lapses of reasonable music that he has written, his ideologic drive for communism has clouded his thinking and produced a piece of trash that would not survive the kindest of the Soviet years. To be fair to this opera, I will critique separately 1) the musical performance, 2) the stage performance, and 3) the opera itself. First, the musical performance was not too badly performed. The only problem is that there was little the was overtly demanding, including no demands on the singer, save to sing weird, no lengthy segments, no  music that could even be thought of as likable. The stage performance represented a complete lapse of ingenuity. Isn't one tired of the suitcase on stage motif carried by a Zoot-suited individual, now found in just about every European opera production? I could wax eloquent about how virtually every scene lacks in creative imagination. The minimalist staging suggested that the producer really didn't care enough for the opera to put much into it. And, that is quite understandable, because it was not an opera to enjoy or appreciate as a work of art. Brecht (via Weill) at the end of the opera spewed out a vindictive against capitalism, the stage designers and Brecht not-so-subtly implying that the greatest sinners of their communistic ideology are the Americans. A leading character named Jimmy is sentenced to death for a lack of money. I presume that Weill was attempting to make some sort of profound statement against greed and monetary avarice, but he fails dismally. Any thinking person finds the philosophical statements of this opera to be poorly developed non-sequitors with a forced conclusion, believed only by Brecht and Weill, and perhaps a few of the performers and audience. Such go the warm and fuzzy statements of the new art, promoting the warm and fuzzy sentiments of the new philosophy and the new politic. It's one thing to have wasted one's money renting this opera, but even a worse crime to have wasted one's time watching it.",1274140800,,2190,4.918918918918919
