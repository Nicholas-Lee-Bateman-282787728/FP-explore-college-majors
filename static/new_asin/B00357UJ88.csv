8388739,2,B00357UJ88,"I am a huge fan of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" and bought this (for a pittance, thankfully) because of the cover blurb reading ""MST3K-Style Tribute to Campy Sci-Fi Romps of Yore."" First off, don't let the title fool you. There is no sex in this film, and the adult content would probably garner a solid PG-13 rating today. This film is in no way titillating, and becomes tedious quickly. Essentially the film is a bunch of recycled clips from over 40 old public domain movies from multiple genres put together into a semi-coherent plot and dubbed (badly) with sophomoric dialogue that I would have been embarrassed by in the seventh grade. To tie the film together there's a small amount of contemporary footage of an astronaut and a babe. The movie garners an occasional chuckle but that's about it: the best and most amusing scene comes at the very end, which is very welcome.

The movie has a ton of extras including a fairly boring ""making of"" feature, some interviews, some extra footage of the modern star from the new scenes (the amply-bosomed Puma Swede,) and a music video by Mr. Chop called ""The Caveman,"" which was the most entertaining thing on the DVD for me. I debated on what rating to give ""Sex Galaxy,"" as with such a lurid title it seems nearly impossible that such a boring movie could possibly result. I seriously considered a one star rating as I was frankly bored and largely annoyed after about the first ten minutes or so, but I eventually settled on two stars for originality as I did like the concept of stitching a feature length film together solely from multiple vintage films. The problem was not in the underlying idea; the problem was in the execution (and particularly the dialogue.) I can't honestly recommend ""Sex Galaxy"" to anyone for any reason as it was a golden opportunity largely squandered. If you want to see a much better and more entertainingly campy movie, go find Doris Wishman's brilliantly loopy ""Nude on the Moon.""",1411084800,2,1968,4.737609329446064
8388740,5,B00357UJ88,I am a big fan of MST3K.  This is a step further.  This is a very clever production.  I hope that more like this will follow.,1389484800,,125,3.730769230769231
8388741,2,B00357UJ88,"I'm a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater, so I thought I'd enjoy this movie, but I couldn't have been more wrong.
The idea of a recycled movie is interesting and unique, but the jokes were just not that funny and were pretty vulgar. Yeah, I know it's called ""Sex Galaxy,"" but honestly, I felt like the dialogue was written by a group of 13 year old boys.
The only reason I even forced myself to finish it was because I paid 5 bucks to rent it.

I know it's SUPPOSED to be a cheesy movie, and we're all supposed to chuckle at the stock footage, but this movie just didn't hold my interest.",1281830400,8,589,4.166666666666667
8388742,4,B00357UJ88,"This took an old science fiction space film and chopped and rearranged the film footage from an out of copyrighted film. A new scene was added with a (""new"") astronaut and the leader of the women (Puma Swede). The DVD also includes extras about the making of the film, director/producer interviews, a photo shoot of Puma Swede, and the full versions of the vintage stag films that were in the film.",1271376000,6,398,4.619718309859155
