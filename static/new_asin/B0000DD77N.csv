1924245,4,B0000DD77N,"Replikate is about a college student named whats-his-face. And whats-his-face is into genetic biology. Along with the team of college scientists and the proffesor played by Eugine Levy (Look him up if you don't know)... anyway, Whats-his-face and the lab geeks are working on cloning, and there testing there cloning machine out on hamsters.

That is until Kate stops by. Kate is a reporter who is interested in how the cloning procedures are going... and wouldnt you know it, she accidently gets clones! (Who saw that coming? come on, raise your hand)

When whats-his-face wakes up from la la land he realises he has an illeagel clone of Kate that the real Kate doesnt know about and he has to hide her from everyone, or else he's in deep *BEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppppppppppp* (learnt that from watching the Osbournes!)

But the thing is, with this new repli-Kate clone, she may be identicle in looks and parts, but she has to learn. So Whats-his-face and his English or Aussie speaking sidekick decide to teach her how to be the ultimate women... through there eyes. But instead end up creating a male in a womens body. Oh, and then the end is like different and stuff and watch it to find out.

Personaly I think Ali Laundry did a great job of playing both original Kate and Repli-kate. The two personalities come accross great, and she delivers some of the best lines i've heard in a while. Which is what suprises me no one has reviewed this 2002 comedy yet!

It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you feel warm inside...... well, it will make you laugh at least.... it's no academy award winning masterpeice, but i wouldnt wipe my bottom with something like Titanic (BLurghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..i don't remember eating that)

Replikate is something along the lines of Wierd Science (remember that, or am I showing my age?) but instead of her being a genie, they changed it to show what a women would be like if she acted like a man.

Rent it at least... it won't kill you... i'm still here arnt I?",1139961600,3,2012,4.650704225352112
1924246,4,B0000DD77N,"This smart and funny film unconsciously reflects the basic elements of the European Comedy of the sixties, where the names of Federico Fellini, Luis  Buuel and Mario Monicelli are the most remarkable ambassadors.

How must the woman of your dreams be? : May be the reflect of your own, a minor caprice here, a sport lover perhaps, an impetuous lover, a furtive heart or an unconditional loving art.

The plot plays with the clever premise what about if a man created a woman according his own specifications. A fantasy which suddenly will materialize in a lab generating a complex web of twisted situations and mistakes with awesome humor sense.

1924247,5,B0000DD77N,"This is a great throwback to eighties comedies that are a little crude, yet full of laughs and memorable characters.  I saw this DVD on the bargain rack at the store and only bought it cause it was so cheap.  I didn't expect much, but I think it's one of the best comedies of the past five years.  No big special effects, or A-list actors, but very entertianing and funny.  James Roday is a very funny grad nerd.  Ali Landry is hot.  Eugene Levy is just great.

1924248,4,B0000DD77N,"I first found out about this film on comedy central, and found it at wal-mart in the five dollar ben, I had to by it. This is a very funny film about the diffrences between men and women. This is the story of Max who is a genetics scientist, and accendintly clones a beatifull lady named............Kate[of course]. While I would love to go on about how funny this film is, I would rather have you watch it for your self. All I can say is that the acting in this is great, the best of all of them is Desmond Askew, most will know im from the great film GO. EVERYONE GO BYE THIS WHILE IT IS STILL 5 DOLLARS.",1080172800,,606,4.058333333333334
1924249,3,B0000DD77N,"Originally shot for theatrical release, then shunted directly to video (and that in the clearance bins), ""Repli-Kate"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie. Taken on its own terms (essentially a very vulgar ""Weird Science"" meets Maxim magazine, it's not for the easily offended), it's occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious.
Its 1980s-style drawbacks can be severe. For example, the monumentally bad ending illustrates that jokes without storytelling results in an aimless ""Gotta wrap this thing up"" feeling. But I've seen worse make it to theaters and into the $100 million club. They may as well have given this a chance.
In a pleasant case of violated expectations, relative newcomer Ali Landry is the funniest person in the movie. She's not only stunningly beautiful head to toe (Hormone check: Lots of skimpy lingerie but no real nudity) but also a sharper, more natural actress than other models. She is relaxed and gets the jokes.",1076198400,11,935,5.281879194630872

8000721,5,B0000DD77N,"I ordered ""Repli-Kate"", which was a movie I had seen a long time ago. I thought it hilarious at the time in the tradition of other National Lampoon movie's i.e. ""The American Pie"" trilogy. It arrived quickly, and in perfect shape !! The price; like so many other's, which I have purchased through Amazon or their merchant's was outstanding. I have completely forgone purchasing from any other site, or from Wal-Mart. I love this site !!",1301097600,,436,4.75
8000722,5,B0000DD77N,"I love this movie so much. As a huge James Roday's fan - I had to buy it - although I saw that movie a few times already.
James looks really great in this movie and the movie itself is funny and original and I really enjoying watching it. On the DVD you can also find Bloopers and Commentary and all kind of bonuses.",1282176000,3,316,3.953125
8000723,1,B0000DD77N,"I can't fathom the many positive reviews here for REPLI-KATE, because in reality this is quite a bad film. The first half goes OK with some funny lines and situations, as the Kate clone ""grows up"" completely out of control. (Physically, she is fully developed on day one, whereas in reality a clone would have to begin as a baby just like us non-clones did.) I did find it funny that because of her male teachers she acquired stereotypical male attributes, such as excessive sex drive. However, I thought having her continually spout obscenities for shock effect was way overdone. Also, I was troubled by the decision to include in a comedy a scene where the Kate clone torments and then poisons a hamster in the laboratory, which causes it to explode. Animal abuse is NEVER funny!! However, I did think that having the male lead fall for the original Kate, even though she was less aggressively sexual than her cloned counterpart, was a nice touch.

But the second half of the film breaks down completely, with the attempt to set up a ""crisis"" in the story handled very ineptly, so that the film becomes a series of lame gags and overacting. I agree with many reviewers that Ali Landry was good in her dual role as both Kates, so it's a shame she did not have a better script to work with. Before I bought this DVD, I should have taken as sufficient warning the fact that it's not reviewed in either LEONARD MALTIN'S MOVIE GUIDE or DVD & VIDEO GUIDE by Martin and Porter (2007 editions). They left it out for a good reason, because even though REPLI-KATE has its good moments, it really is just another substandard teen flick. (Of course, people who enjoy awful movies such as this one are just going to vote me a ""No"" on here!)",1249171200,2,1729,4.523961661341853
8000724,5,B0000DD77N,2 guys think they can mold the fresh mind of a cloned hot chick to make her more like a man.  They succeed and wish they hadn't.  I laughed myself to tears.,1200355200,3,156,3.84375
