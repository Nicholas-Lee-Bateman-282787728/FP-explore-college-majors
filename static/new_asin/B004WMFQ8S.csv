4487611,4,B004WMFQ8S,"Bill Plymton is a singular artist. He's produced a lot in his time and his works are usually worth note if only for their uniqueness. You can pick them out of a crowd by their hand drawn style alone. Add to that the quirky stories and you're in for a wild ride.

In this outing you have a particularly nasty individual (vaguely Richard Nixon-ish looking) who, after killing a butterfly, finds he is sprouting wings on his back. These wings send him on an adventure in dealing with the people around him who see him as a shortcut in fulfilling their dreams.

I've seen a few of his works and they all have a rather cock-eyed, whimsical sense to them. This is not really different in that regard but it is darker. Most of the people here are not pleasant. They're mean, greedy, self-serving and overall just a nasty bunch. What you root for is his transformation. You DO get that but it really doesn't effect those around him. Save for the bar owner's wife they're still snot heads, so there isn't much relief in that regard.

This has his typical hand drawn look, and at 88 minutes, this must have been grueling work. He works with only three other animators and a comparatively small crew. As a matter of fact, I believe the music credits ran longer than the production credits. This is another point. The sound design and sound track are outstanding. If this is available on CD I could easily see adding it to my library.

This is a good addition to Plymton's body of work. It IS dark but it's worth the time for anyone who is into the far side of animated film making.",1313971200,5,1570,4.422145328719723
4487612,5,B004WMFQ8S,"Plympton's films are known for being hysterically funny and this one isn't, but it is his best feature film.  Amazing looking, ironic, heartfelt, unexpected, and with no dialog.",1313366400,9,177,5.321428571428571

8445313,3,B004WMFQ8S,"... but the execution could be better. Still, when you pull Plympton's hand animation together with Terry Gilliam's - well, whatever it is, something worth watching almost has to come out of it. Enjoyable, but there are others I like better.

8445316,5,B004WMFQ8S,"After hearing that Tom Waits contributed to the soundtrack I couldn't pass this up. Before this film I'd never seen anything by Bill Plympton (which surprises me, seeing how prolific he's been), but his dark and surrealistic style won me over almost immediately. The storytelling is almost completely visual; there is no actual dialogue in the film. The protagonist begins the film as an unsympathetic drunk who could have been pulled straight from the pages of a Bukowski novel. The atmosphere throughout the film is grim, and Plympton successful strikes a balance between black comedy and genuine emotion. Amazing that it took so few animators to produce a film like this.",1372291200,,674,5.081081081081081

8445318,5,B004WMFQ8S,"I saw my first Bill Plympton animations at a festival, and like the rest of the audience I was laughing so hard I was near losing my mind.  A friend and I then went shopping for groceries, still giggling, until we came across a display for Wonder bread that had a rotating skewered loaf at the top.  We started laughing so much that security came over to us.

With those, I saw a trailer for the upcoming Idiots & Angels, a 2008 film, but it was not until 2011 that it come out.

Alcohol, tobacco, firearms, shelves, a television, a broom, a butterfly, an alarm clock, a razor --- each of these is used in multiple ways during the course of the film. There is an almost unbeatable economy shown in the settings, items, and characters used to tell a great story.  The characters do not talk -- all of the action and dialog is shown by Plympton's incredibly expressive style.  And all 100 thousand or so frames, he drew.  The continuous shot of the main character getting ready in the morning has items morphing into each other one after another.

The main character is an unlikable fellow who grows wings one day, and they force him to do good things.  Five days later, the movie is still sticking with me strongly, in all the ways that makes me glad I've watched it.  If I needed to do a film analysis for college, about themes, this would be the film I'd pick for a few weeks of thoughtful analysis.

Highly recommended.",1366588800,4,1935,5.750877192982456
