2476237,5,B000E0OE58,Full of suspense. Held my sixth-grade class' attention. It made me hungry to see the next episode of the Intercepter.,1175644800,,117,4.9
2476238,5,B000E0OE58,"I managed to catch this on the National Geographic channel recently. It has lots of great tornado footage with some science thrown in for fun. Anyone fascinated by the beauty and destructive power of tornadoes (like me) would enjoy this DVD. Also, watching an armored car drive directly into a vortex is definitely worth a look.",1169337600,7,328,4.875
2476239,5,B000E0OE58,"My son loves all kinds of bad weather, but tornadoes are his all-time favorite.  He got this DVD from my brother for a gift, and we watch it at least 3 times a week.  It's great for the kids yet interesting enough to hold the adult audience's attention.  The contrast between Josh and Sean is a fantastic way to show how widespread the fascination with lousy weather can be.",1154908800,13,374,4.391304347826087
2476254,1,B000E0OE58,"Where's ZERO STARS, again??

BORING, boring, boring!

You can see the real expert thinking Sean is a total idiot because he doesn't have any actual maps.

He can't make a waterproof vehicle; any schmuck should be able to note the HOLES in the welds are going to have water in them soon. Namely when you can SEE daylight.

I was thinking with a shudder that a woman actually wanted to have children with a fool.

I was so bored I was seriously hoping one would suck him up and drop him from about 100 feet up. An annoying little dork and very arrogant, for a guy who's clearly an idiot.

Don't waste your time or money on this.  If you insist, get it from the library, like I did.",1414800000,,679,4.217054263565892

2476257,3,B000E0OE58,"Sean Casey mortgages his California home and sells his stocks to finance the construction ($81,000) of a homemade 'tank' called the Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) which he plans to drive to Tornado Alley (12 mpg) and then into a tornado with the intention of filming it. As for little issues like the long distance between California and Tornado Alley, the opportunity and actual costs of taking eg. six weeks during the summer to pursue this quest, the fact that his vehicle is believed safe only in winds of about 160 mph, and the likelihood the interior of any tornado would be mostly dark and make his windshield wipers useless - are ignored. On the last day of his quest Casey does end up on the periphery of a small tornado that disables his wipers, and he obtains little if any footage of commercial value - his goal.

Update, 2013: Casey has built another TIV, with even less mileage (8 mpg, at best), and was featured on Storm Chasers. Tested behind a Boeing 747 with engines at full throttle (160 mph winds), the driver's door pulled open because Casey forgot to lock it. Tested again at 250 mph it suffered no significant ill effects. On May 27, 2013 TIV 2 intercepted a large tornado in Kansas, recording winds of 150 - 175 mph before the anemometer was disabled. The resulting clip has been viewed over 900,000 times, but isn't that worthwhile, in my opinion.",1374969600,,1373,4.650205761316872
2476258,4,B000E0OE58,"For those who are interested in a lot of tornado footage this is not the film for them though there is some dramatic footage.  Primarily its a human interest story about a guy who slaps together a welded nightmare of an unpolished vehicle that actually functions.  Its kind of like a Jimmy Stewart everyman story that the average person can identify with and in the end he's victorious.  Interesting to see the 2 primary characters in a symbiotic relationship of differing technologies, one with ultra professional polished machinery and vehicles staying at the edge of tornados and the other with a heap of homemade scrap metal diving right in to the heart of the rampage.  Well worth watching.",1319500800,,695,4.864406779661017
2476259,5,B000E0OE58,"Our whole family likes this video.  The photography is great and very exciting, but not too scary for my super sensitve 6-year-old.  The main actors are fun and engaging.  Good that we all like it because my two boys (the other one is 3) want to watch it every day.",1301961600,,265,4.26
2476260,3,B000E0OE58,"Lots of us are fascinated by tornadoes; some are even compelled to experience the rush of chasing tornadoes; but few indeed are those who pursue the reckless dream of seeing a tornado from the inside out.  Meet Sean Casey, a documentary filmmaker who set out to realize his dream of filming inside a tornado's most destructive and least understood zone.  Having mortgaged his house to design and build his own Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV), we watch as he leaves his pregnant wife to spend six weeks in Tornado Alley just hoping for a chance to drive the ugliest vehicle known to man directly into the path of a twister.  With 8000 pounds of steel plating and a bulletproof glass dome for his IMAX camera, the TIV is also equipped with sensors to help measure different aspects of any tornado it encounters - but Casey is no scientist.  That is why he teams up with meteorologist and storm chaser Josh Wurman.  With his mobile Doppler radar vehicles, Wurman can help guide him where he wants to be, while Casey can supply him with scientific readings and information he cannot obtain himself.

The setup sounds pretty exciting, but I found this documentary surprisingly dull, for the most part.  May and June of 2005 turned out to be a slow season for tornadoes, and Casey and the TIV miss out on the few chances they have of going where no armored vehicle has gone before.  Then, as if it had been written in the stars, the team finally gets the chance they've been waiting for on Casey's very last day.  If the filmmakers hadn't told me that the TIV finally met a tornado head-on, though, I would not have known it because the event is surprisingly anticlimactic.  The only excitement we get comes in the form of another vehicle that gets closer to the storm than the crew intended and some great shots of the rare occurrence of two different types of tornadoes being generated simultaneously by a single storm.

This is an interesting little documentary, but it's not very exciting at all.  That being the case, I would only recommend it to those with a true passion for tornadoes and storm chasing.  There are much more exciting videos out there for those with only a casual interest in the subject.",1289865600,,2205,4.652061855670103
2476261,5,B000E0OE58,This show is a good one to watch if you wanna see the inside of a twister. I enjoyed it all the way through. Brilliant!,1185926400,3,119,3.8
2476262,1,B000E0OE58,"If you like people standing around and being bored, then your in luck. This is what Tornado Intercept is all about. I made the mistake of buying this dumb film. The name itself would indicate a fast and on the edge of your seat type of film loaded with all kinds of real life tornado footage. Oh well, not the case here. I'm still trying to think of someone that I might give this film to, so that they may get something out of it. I couldn,t.",1185494400,7,443,4.103448275862069
2476263,1,B000E0OE58,"It's all about this guy who mortgaged his house to build this Back to the Future car.  Although it was a cool idea, he didn't really get in any tornados and I was looking for more of a documentary on torndaos and storms.  This was a disappointment.",1184284800,9,248,4.25531914893617

We can't remember the name of the car he built, but we all thought it was pretty darn cool.  We didn't think it was boring at all.  My 9 year old says he really liked the twin tornadoes.  So we'd recommend watching it :).",1496448000,,372,3.972972972972973
