8401753,2,B003OX1ALS,"The year is 1987. Two couples are taken on a cruise in the South Pacific lead by Captain Macho (Manuel Fihman) a portly Hispanic who does not know port from starboard. They land on what appears to be a deserted island for sun, fun, and cocaine. The movie stars Amanda/Kitty Cole (co-writer and costume designer) and Suzi Lorraine, best known for her appearances in the soft core Misty Mundae movies.

I was under the mistaken impression the movie would be about young couples frolicking on an island, then having to fight off cannibals and zombies. It is not. PLOT SPOILER The landing party dies in quick order, except for one girl. There is a needless flashback scene to add some time to make this movie 70 minutes. The rest of the movie was how our Ms. Cole tries to integrate with the tribe. The movie was short and misleading. It is a movie with zombies, but not a zombie movie. It is a movie with cannibals, but not a cannibal movie. The acting was above norm, but overall the film was fairly lame.

F-bomb, sex, no nudity.",1309910400,2,1028,4.491978609625669
