2890641,5,B000STC00Q,Both of these movies are excellent.  They are two of my 6 years old daughters favorites.  It is nice to watch movies that do not always have princesses and are not cartoons.,1360195200,4,173,4.375
2890642,5,B000STC00Q,"My 7 year old loves these movies!  Matilda has a few ""scary"" scenes, but that only seemed to make her more interested!  What a great deal for the two movies in one!",1359417600,,164,4.09375
2890643,5,B000STC00Q,"My 7-year-old daughter has now watched Matilda about 9 times, and Pippi Longstocking about 3 or 4 times.  Good, old-fashioned quality literature in film form!",1357084800,,158,5.32
2890644,5,B000STC00Q,"I was a little worried when I read the reviews before buying this video, but opted to give it a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. I am now going to buy the set of Pippi for my kids, and I'm sure they will enjoy it just as they did the movie.",1342483200,,246,3.75
2890645,5,B000STC00Q,"I bought this for my 6-year-old. I got it for Matilda and thought of Pippi as an extra. I'm honestly not sure if she's watched Pippi yet, but she loves Matilda and can't get enough of it.",1309996800,,187,4.081081081081081
2890646,5,B000STC00Q,I have been looking for these movies for so long. I was so happy to find them on Amazon.com and now that I have them I watch them all the time. These are the kind of movies that get past down through generation after generation. I also please that I receive them before the actual delivery date and that everything was in good condition when I receive these movies. Thank you again and I would recommend everyone I know to look on Amazon.com.,1295222400,3,442,4.337349397590361

2890662,5,B000STC00Q,Although I do not think widescreen is an option it is still a great deal. The movies are two separate disks in one case. I like that a lot better than the double features with flip sides and one disk. Movies are very subjective but personally growing up pippi longstocking was the first VHS we rented when MY family got a VHS. .LATER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. Good family films. No profanity. Really adults and kids would like Matilda. Idk about pippi. But I like it as it was a childhood favorite.  Great price point. Sure to please!! Great to gift.,1480982400,,544,4.44
2890663,3,B000STC00Q,"Great price. The whole family loved Matilda, we we're not a fan of pippy, but for the price it didn't matter.",1479859200,,109,4.238095238095238
2890664,5,B000STC00Q,"Little Bitty Pretty One came on my Pandora and immediately reminded me of the movie Matilda which, amazingly, I did not already have. Imagine my surprise and delight when I got on Amazon to find it and it is available in a double feature with PIPPI!! I am so thrilled about both of these movies. If you have kids/grandkids that have not seen these movies (or read the books) this is an awesome combo to watch with them. So many adventures to be had with these strong, independent, head strong little girls. What great role models to have!",1479772800,,538,4.5

2890674,5,B000STC00Q,"My kids and I loved Pippi. I never saw it until I was an adult. I loved tying brushes to our feet, to see if we could clean the floor. Why not make work more fun?
As to disrespecting adults, the ones she did, didn't deserve much respect.

I'd watch this movie, dancing around,  with or without kids. I've sent the single version to all my adult kids, and am buying myself a 2nd, hoping THIS is the long-awaited,  theater-shown Widescreen.
Search the single PIPPI LONGSTOCKING dvd customer Reviews, and their comments for info.  Word Search :  ""Widescreen "".  Apparently, the U.S. Region 1, was the ONLY version not released in Widescreen. What is it with U.S. mfg'rs still producing very popular movies in  Fullscreen, vs the Widescreen we saw, and loved, in theaters?",1471132800,,768,4.686567164179104

2890707,5,B000STC00Q,"I have been searching for both of these movies for years now. Lucky for me, others made the amazing choice to put them together in an awesome double feature. And on two separate discs. Yay!
I grew up watching both of these films, and I consider myself better for it. Both movies encourage something that is severely lacking today: imagination. What child does not wish they could move things with their mind, or walk up walls?
Show me a kid that never wished for a horse or a monkey or both... I know I did! And even if your parents were the best, there were times you just felt like you didn't belong with them.
Two movies, one great low price. Buy this combo and you'll never be sorry!",1440460800,3,687,4.333333333333333

2890719,5,B000STC00Q,"Granddaughter (age 6) loved both these movies - we read the books first, of course.  Both were fairly faithful to the books, and she and I prefer live action movies to cartoon versions.  Matilda was a little scary for me but she did not mind how really cruel Miss Crunchbull was, and she loved the ""bad guys"" in Pippi - ""they were so funny"".  Matilda might frighten a younger or more easily scared child though.  I always recommend reading the books first  - there is so much more in them usually than it's possible to get into a movie and so often some gratuitous violence is added to the movie (as in the current version of Paddington).",1427068800,4,638,4.418803418803419

2890724,4,B000STC00Q,"Great deal for these two classics. We've watched both and my kids (5 and 6 yrs old) liked both movies, but especially love Matilda. They have wanted to watch it every day since we first watched it a few days back. I'm not giving it a full 5 stars because Matilda is a bit on the dark side. I knew this going into it, I just didn't remember how creepy the Trunchbull and the parents are. And there are a few bad words, which I always cringe at. But the movie has a happy ending and has it's light and funny parts. Obviously my kids still love it despite the sort of dark undertone, and the story is cute and fun. I also like that it encourages reading, being smart, etc.",1415404800,,669,4.114503816793893
