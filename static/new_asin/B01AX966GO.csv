8748761,4,B01AX966GO,"Let me say, as an animation student, this show is more intense and relatable than any sci-fi or fantasy show where the world hangs in the balance. But even for non-animators, it's still a compelling story about young women finding their place in the world. And even at that, it's refreshing to have an anime where the women aren't sexualized, and characters that want them to be are mocked by the writers. This show has just the right amount of humor and drama, and while I wouldn't call the characters particularly complex, they at least fall outside any tropes and do become significantly more developed.

As for the disc itself, there were two OVAs included in the Japanese releases, fictional episodes from the shows within the show, that seem to be missing from the US version. On top of that, there is no dub, so don't expect to listen to this in the background while you animate unless you're fluent in Japanese. I would give the series 5/5, but because of the bare bones blu ray, I'm taking a star off. There's also no reason the two volumes had to be split. The entire series comprises 3 discs. There's no reason not to release a complete series set. Thankfully there's nothing wrong with the video or audio.

Fantastic series, lackluster blu ray release. If you have decent internet (I don't), just use Crunchyroll first to decide if you like it.",1496361600,3,1356,4.645833333333333
8748762,5,B01AX966GO,"Shirobako is a geat Japanese anime about what else . . . making anime.  Overheated work environment, crazy co-workers and subcontractors.  Both seasons are just wonderful.  Plus this blu-ray disc arrived super fast.",1491782400,,215,5.454545454545454
8748763,1,B01AX966GO,Impossibly boring. The story and characters are incredibly bland and uninteresting.,1481328000,,83,6.636363636363637
8748764,5,B01AX966GO,"This series is absolutely amazing! If you enjoy the making of anime then this is for you! I loved Shirobako 1 and was so excited that there was a part 2. The art is beautiful the voice cast is great and the story is really good too in my mind.
Hope more people check out this series cause it is definitely a must see.",1475366400,3,317,3.96875
8748765,4,B01AX966GO,"I love the show itself, but Sentai really dropped the ball on this. The subtitles vanish if you rewind or fast-forward and I write this now after spending 5 minutes rewinding and fast-forwarding over and over to get them back. It is very frustrating.",1466208000,7,250,4.704545454545454
