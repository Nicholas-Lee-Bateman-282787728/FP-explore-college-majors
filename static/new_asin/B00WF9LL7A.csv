7131345,5,B00WF9LL7A,"Yato is a very minor god without so much as a single shrine to his name. This is a fact he intends to change, one 5 yen coin at a time. After saving a girl named Hiyori from a traffic accident, she tracks him down and befriends him. Then they are joined by Yukine, who has the ability to transform into a sacred treasure, a weapon that can be used by a god. Together the three of them battle beings called you and slowly learn about Yatos past.

I quite enjoyed this series and Yato as a character really grew on me. His past isn't particularly detailed, but it does a good job of illustrating how and why he ended up as he did. Most of the story is him developing relationships with Hiyori and Yukine, something that develops into a particularly great scene.

The ending wraps up the show nicely, but the manga is still running and a second season was announced 3/31/15. There is also an OVA, but it is not available domestically. I believe it is just a side story though, so not essential to the main storyline.

UPDATE 6/21/16: Since writing this review the second season has finished airing and I have watched it. Watching the second season actually made me like the first season better - mostly because what bothered me about the first season was not getting enough backstory. The second season does a good job of satisfying that need (though it does not finish the story either). This is now one of my favorite anime series of all time!",1430870400,29,1442,4.413533834586466

7131357,3,B00WF9LL7A,"I'm writing this as a bit if a warning to potential buyers. I was told this would be a new product but when I took off the cardboard casing (which has a gash across the front) I noticed damage to the products case. There's a dent with tearing about the size of a quater on the binding of the case. I immediately was concerned with the quality of the actual product and I noticed already there is a small 1 inch scrape on the first disk. Everything else is fine, thank god the blu ray is fine and functional but that alone depreciated it's value for me. I don't mind the damages to the case as much as I was mindful of the damages to the actual usable product. This alone is what made me write a review in the first place but I intend to return if the product is not working fully with all of its features. Please be aware before purchase that even ""new"" could potentially have a similar issue. Not to mention this was shipped and fulfilled by Amazon LLC. as a whole not from a third party distributor.

As for the anime itself, if you haven't watched it you should. It's a nice blend of Shonen, a little romance, comedy and a lot of Japanese nods to their own culture and mythology.",1485043200,3,1182,4.20704845814978

I'm not an anime fan but I happened across this series while doing research for a creative writing project and decided to check it out---ended up binge watching both seasons in three days and have been suffering from withdrawl ever since. It has the perfect amount of humor to balance the emotional backstories and the voice actors bring it all into vivid, drama-packed color (both the Japanese and English dubs). I've picked up the manga series that inspired the show and love that just as much. Here's my five yen wish for a season 3!",1478304000,,626,4.648648648648648

7131387,5,B00WF9LL7A,This series is definitely in my top ten from funimation already. That is no understatement this series is worth getting and that is all I will tell you about it because you must see it.

7131391,5,B00WF9LL7A,"For those fans who are into action, fantasy, comedy, the supernatural, with a touch of romance this is a fantastic show.  The action scenes are wonderfully produced and the soundtrack fits the battle scenes spectacularly.  This first season corresponds to the first couple volumes of the manga. It is important to note that the anime does sidetrack to an alternative character villain for the anime adaptation. For fans of the manga series, we see the character development of Yukine in this series and development of both Yato and Yukine's bond in this first season.

Summary of the Show:

Yato is a minor god whose dream is to have a lot of followers worshipping him and praying to him. Unfortunately, his dream is far from coming true since he doesn't even have a single shrine dedicated to him. To make things worse, the only partner he had to help him solve people's problems, had just quit the job.

His godly existence and luck just might change when he stumbles upon Iki Hiyori and saves her life; a feat which also leaves her in quite a predicament so she is stuck with him until her problem gets resolved. Together with Hiyori and his new partner-weapon Yukine, Yato will do everything he can to gain fame, recognition and just maybe, one shrine dedicated to him, as well.

Technical Details:

There were three released editions for the first season of Noragami.

There was a standard edition which is the blue ray and dvd combo pack which is the the set in one case with a removable sleeve(which I included pictures of). Next was the limited edition set which has both the blu-ray and dvd placed in a hard chipboard. Finally, Funimation had their own exclusive release which was the limited edition format (with the chipboard) included with two bonus items of a 5 yen coin and a  recreated card holder that we saw Yato create from one of the episodes.

This collection is in both english sub and dub with a second season currently being released, so hopefully we will be able to have a beautiful second season released to dvd/blu-ray in the future.",1447545600,10,2059,4.694444444444445

7131394,5,B00WF9LL7A,"This show is an amazing new addition to the anime library. It takes place in modern day Japan as Yato, a drifter god, tries to hit it big. He does this by taking medial jobs for 5 yen at a time. The main plot takes place within the three main characters:Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine provide both a sense of drama and comedy that intertwines perfectly. The plot is somewhat hard to explain, so I'll skip that and go straight to character development. The character development is brilliant! It starts as just, episodes which are actually interesting, but kinda random. The plot builds up without you even realizing it, then bam! It hits you with a grand episode and you won't want to quit watching.",1445212800,,693,4.596774193548387

7131397,5,B00WF9LL7A,"At first I wasn't sure if I'd like this series. After the third episode, I got hooked. This series has all the anime genres I want. Well written, original, beautiful art, great character relationships and development. The manga is slightly different from the anime so it was enjoyable to read the same plot line with a slightly different twist. Note: The manga does not have Rabo plot. Overall, I'm obsessed with this series now.",1444262400,,429,4.8108108108108105

7131399,5,B00WF9LL7A,"Noragami is one of those animes that comes out of nowhere and grabs many people. It does a perfect blend of various genres. Comedy, action, drama are all represented in this show. And each of these is executed perfectly.
The anime is about a lesser deity named Yato who is seeking to gain recognition. His first goal is mostly to raise enough money in order to build a shrine. How he does this is by taking on jobs. Due to the fact he is a lesser deity, his jobs end up being very mundane. He will do things such as finding a cat or filling in for someone's shift at a gas station. Yato is an entertaining character. Often he is shown to have a sense of human and can be a bit of a narcissist. His performance int he dub is done by Jason Liebrecht (many will recognize him as Train on Black Cat and Hei on Darker Than Black).
The other protaganists are Hiyori and Yukine. Hiyori is voiced by the up and coming Bryn Apprill. She is a human girl who runs into Yato one day and her life completely changes. Similar to how Pokemon's Misty would hang around Ash trying to have him fix damage he caused, Hiyori is there constantly trying to get Yato to help her with something he promised. Often this leads to humorous situations. The third of the trio is Yukine. The ghost of a young man. He is voiced by Micah Solusod (many will know him as Touma in the A Certain series and as Soul Eater Evans in the Soul Eater series). He does a great job playing an immature but sympathetic character. Like Yato, he also gets into trouble various times. And dealing with Yato often leaves him annoyed and confused.

The series is great despite only being one season long. Despite that, the show has been confirmed for a Season 2 and the manga is still on going.",1443744000,8,1744,4.284848484848485
7131400,5,B00WF9LL7A,"Absolutely one of my favorite series. Will probably read the manga after. If you want a light-hearted, heart-tugging series - then get this series! You will fall in love with characters & witness some incredible battles :)",1443225600,5,222,5.027027027027027

There is a little more ""fan-service"" (panty shots) then in the original manga which is a little distracting, but the characters are colorful, complex, and a joy to watch. The ending of the series is considered filler but it has enough entertainment and epicness that most viewers won't care. Overall, Noragami is a thrill to watch with it's colorful characters and complex themes that it presents in this world, and as of this review I can't wait for the second season!",1440720000,,536,4.712765957446808

The case itself feels cheap, like it won't last as long as a normal dvd case. Ive noticed that in all my funimation blue ray sets, so maybe it's a funimation thing idk. The slide on cover art is nice, but it also feels like it can be damaged easily over time. When putting it back on, it feels like its trying to snag the cover on the actual DVD case. Sooo yeah. The second DVD looks a little scratched on top, like I was given a used set or it happened due to the loose discs. For only 12 episodes and the price, I expected better quality. I planned on getting the 2nd season, which costs more (probably same # eps) and now I'm not sure. I've seen the show and really like it,  so at best I'll give a 4 star assuming the discs play properly.",1526860800,,857,4.101190476190476
