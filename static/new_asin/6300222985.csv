261789,5,6300222985,"I first discovered Super Stomachs at my college fitness center. I don't think my life has ever been the same. I know my abs haven't! Joanie Greggain rocks. The work out is not too long (about 15 minutes) and really makes the most of the time. You feel a difference right away and the work out is fun because of the 80s feel. This really is worth the money. Just make sure you have a VHS player! This video also has a bonus aerobics work out.  Like Super Stomachs, it is not too long and seems effective (I have only used it once, but I was impressed).",1197849600,,551,4.149532710280374
261790,5,6300222985,I love this simple ab workout!  I have done this workout forever and still love it!,1168387200,2,83,4.1875
261791,5,6300222985,"I first bought this video in the 80's.  My first impression was that it was outdated and slow moving but it wasn't intimidating and didn't take a lot of time and that kept me coming back day after day.  Hard to believe that 15 minutes a day would make a difference but true to her word I felt results right away and saw them after only a couple of weeks.  I wore my first tape out and lost the second to my sister.  I'm on my third now and still feel the same way, no need for bells and whistles just the slow burn of some great exercises and something that easily fits into my schedule.",1160438400,6,587,4.0344827586206895
261792,5,6300222985,"This is the best ab workout I've ever seen...within 6 months of daily use I went from a chubby belly to a rock hard 8 pack (yes, I had two extra ""boxes""). It's now been 4 years since

I've used it. What's great is it's only about 8 minutes (if you skip the warmups like I do) so you can get in 2 workouts a day in the morning and before bed if you can...great selection of exercises that get your stomach nice and burning, which is how

you know it's working and isolating the right

muscles...

Whatsup with a DVD copy though? My tape is almost shot

from use and age (lol)",1117497600,3,574,4.04424778761062
261793,5,6300222985,"This is still the best ab workout you can find.  I have gone through three of these tapes and lost them during moves, and can't live without it.  I'm a procrastinator and many times lazy, but this is one workout I never passed up.  The first time you do it might be a little intense, but you will definently feel the burn.",1080259200,2,322,4.161290322580645
261794,5,6300222985,"I have approximatley fifteen workout tapes and can honestly say this is the one I use the most.  It is only about twelve minutes of exercise, so you have no excuse about lack time.  The workout is intense, but starts out easy enough to lull you in.  Joanie gives alternate moves to simplify or intensify your workout.  If you do it five days a week as she recommends, you will see a visable change in a short period of time.  I could feel the difference immediately and see it in a couple weeks.  I've recommended this tape to many people and those who have taken the trouble to find it have come back to thank me. I like to combine it into a longer workout using the legs or buns tapes she has. There are a lot of newer tapes out on the market, but this one has proven the most effective for me.",1043020800,10,796,4.136363636363637
261795,5,6300222985,"Thats'right this tape was introduced in 1985 and I've loved it so much that when I saw a copy of it recently I had to buy it, just in case I over use it. This is my third copy, the original tape was loaned to a friend she used it so much that when she returned it to me, it finally torn. I don't care how many ab tapes they come up with, nothing beats this one. I remember getting up at 6am doing the tape, my then husband thought I was crazy.  Crazy and smart, he's gone and I still have the tape, whose laughing now!! Super Stomach, you go Ms. Greggains!!!",1019260800,3,558,3.938053097345133
261796,5,6300222985,"Believe it or not, this video was initially released in 1985 and I have been using it since then.  I stopped using the video for awhile and relied more on traditional situps or stationary weight machines.  The results were not as effective as ""Super Stomachs"".  If you are serious about reducing flab in your abdominal area, I strongly recommend this tape.
Unfortunately, my tape has been damaged (overuse!)and I'm now purchasing this item again.",1018656000,8,446,5.0
261797,5,6300222985,"This is an excellent workout for all sections of the abdomin.  It's very difficult to do all the exercises the first few times through the tape, but you can rest any time.  In fact, I would suggest resting the first few times or you will be very sore.  However, the results are a firm, flat stomach area.  Ms. Greggains recommends doing the workout 5 times a week, but I get results with only twice a week.  She tells you proper form and breathing techniques.  This video takes only 15 minutes including the warm up and cool down.  I love it and since the current fashion is belly exposure, you'll sculpt great abs to show off.",999388800,21,627,4.4
261848,5,6300222985,"This is a wonderful tape.  If done 5 days a week, you will see great results.  She is wonderful and the tape is wonderful.",1358640000,,122,4.041666666666667
261849,5,6300222985,I've been doing  these 12 minutes a day for over twenty years. I had had mechanical back pain but have not for 15 years.  These are super back friendly and therapeutic.  After my daughter went to college to play collegiate tennis I virtually stopped working out and had gained about 25 extra pounds on top of the 15 extra I already had.  I never stopped doing this 12 minute workout so I at least had this perpetual link to some form of fitness.  I have finally found a diet that has worked for me (More on that later) and have lost forty pounds.  I always knew I had abs under the flab and behold you can see them now.  I am a Family Physician so I am knowledgeable in these issues.  I  would recommend these to all with mechanical back issues with the exception of acute discs. I also thinks it's just a good 12 minute a day workout for the parts of the body most in need of support. Thank's Joanie! RG,1281916800,3,904,4.179190751445087
261850,5,6300222985,This tape is excellent for getting flat abs. Its HARD but you'll start to see results very soon ...  just in time for summer.,1264809600,,125,4.208333333333333
261851,5,6300222985,"This was my favorite all time workout video.  It was fast and effective and she was very easy to relate to and yet an inspiration with her phenomenal bod.
If anyone knows of these being on dvds, please leave me a comment and let me know!
I used this one so much that I went through 3 of copies of this particular one!  It only takes about 15 minutes but if you do it every day you will see a difference fast.",1264118400,,408,3.9634146341463414
261852,5,6300222985,I first used this video back in the 70's and thought it was great then. It is an excellent and very effective way to get your stomach back in shape.,1244937600,,148,3.966666666666667
261853,5,6300222985,"I used this tape back in college.  My brother used it in his Frat too, all the guys would be lined up 'holding a tray of raw vegetables'  I used it for about six years and then it died on me (it is a VHS) I NEVER found anything that worked as good as this tape - It is incredibly dated with the music and clothes but whatever the combination is that she uses it is the most effective tape ever, I was so happy to get this tape again. I am really scared that it is going to get all eaten up too eventually but if you are thinking about buying this it is AMAZING!  15 min a day, sooooo worth it!",1244332800,4,593,3.8048780487804876
261854,5,6300222985,"Joanie is a throwback when exercising was simple.  I have several dvds regarding abdominal exercising, however I keep going back to Ms. Greggain.  Perhaps, it's her personality and simplistic approach.  What's great about this video is that it is short and to the point and you do see results quickly.  Since it's not a long video and one does see results quickly, it can easily fit into one's daily/weekly schedule. I will be transferring this video onto a DVD...it's a keeper.",1242864000,,478,4.864197530864198
261855,5,6300222985,"I grew up watching this VHS with my mother....and to this day, i'm still a fan. The workout is amazing. It really works! Wish it would come out on DVD though.",1238198400,,158,4.129032258064516
261856,5,6300222985,This was exactly what we were looking for - a tape we'd actually worn out over the years.  It's a great exercise and the tape was in perfect condition.,1235952000,,151,4.206896551724138
261857,5,6300222985,"Joanie Greggain's Super Stomachs is Awesome! There is no other way to put it. I used this after having my children 20 years ago, and got my shape back. Now that I am in my late 40's my body started to change. I purchased another copy and started working out with it again. My body is almost back where it should be, just need a little more time and I will be back to normal. I just wish it was in DVD. Just saw ""Ultimate Abs"" and that is my next purchase, just for the new technology. Thanks Joanie for keeping my body in shape all these years!",1199404800,,544,4.046296296296297
7806497,4,6300222985,After all these years I still find this the best abs workout....start slow or you'll regret the sore abs....,1524528000,,108,4.7368421052631575
7806498,4,6300222985,"Good pacing, kinda cheesy music, but Joanie keeps you going. Its over before you know it and you feel it even in the short amount of time you work out. The actual workout is maybe 12 minutes long. Its not all on the floor either, which is refreshing for an ab tape... You end up feeling like you have accomplished at least something in a short amount of time. She does offer modifications for those not so fit, such as myself. There is only one maneuver I don't like-the ""U"" sit-up which makes my back pop, don't know that its that bad for everyone tho. Overall, 4 stars. Too bad it's not available, keep your eyes open for it as an ab workout for your collections!!!",1520985600,,667,4.301587301587301
7806499,3,6300222985,"Love this workout for abs, but unfortunately the tplastic lip on the tape arrived broken. I've been able to use it but it's a little shakey, not sure how long it will last. But love this workout.",1468454400,,195,4.297297297297297

7806501,5,6300222985,"I have used this tape off and on for 30 years.  It works great, doesn't take too long and when I was in my 20's I had great definition from doing this tape.",1455667200,,156,3.727272727272727
7806502,5,6300222985,The video was in great condition and contained a superb set of exercises for the abs--not too strenuous and yet very effective.,1445126400,,127,4.818181818181818
7806503,5,6300222985,"Just like everyone else, I started using this video back in the 1980s when I was about 20 and now I'm 46. The reason I have pretty good abs NOW is because of this video!!  This was the video that after about a year I had abs that look like the photo on the front,  and only did this about three times a week. It's a quick video, 10 min.  Believe it or not, after two kids I still have pretty decent abs - especially for my age --  and it's because I kept up doing the exercises I learned from this video.  I wish they would put it on a DVD, our VCR is long gone.",1429228800,2,562,3.769230769230769

7806506,5,6300222985,"I have been exercising to Joanie Greggain's ""Ultimate Abs"" for many years.  Her tapes really shows results.  There are many tapes that I have in my study room, but I always come back to Joanie's.  I do wish these were on DVD.  I will purchase ""Super Stomachs"" as I am sure this will do wonders for me as well.  It's great to have tapes that truly works.  Thank you so much Joanie :-)",1368403200,,383,4.178082191780822
