2712679,5,B000LPS2VI,"This DVD is a compilation of shows from the PBS series Curious George. Since it began my 3 year old daughter has been in love with it. The stories are fun and will teach kids a thing or two. I love the narration by famous screen actor William H. Macy. Since it is almost 2 hours long it is great to have on long trips in the car. If your child liked the recent CG movie or is a fan of CG books, they are sure to enjoy this DVD.",1174521600,42,427,3.7555555555555555

I'm a 22 year old female, and I actually found it a bit amusing myself, unlike other children cartoons.

2712834,5,B000LPS2VI,"Don't confuse tbis DVD with the movie ""Curious George,"" which comes in a similar DVD case. These are episodes from the far superior TV show. Not that the movie isn't worth your time and money. This is just so much more so.

The product lives up to the credits: Dr. John on the swinging theme song; Ron Howard and Brian Glazer executive producing; and William H. Macy, who makes the most of any role he assumes, as narrator.

There's an urban, downtown quality to these episodes, from being drawn in the manner of classic New Yorker cartoons to the jazzy soundtrack, extending even to the live action suffixes in which a group of young kids further delving into some element in the episode. Even when they're in a rural setting, you get the feeling these kids aren't suburban spawn.

George comes off as a monkey-fied human preschooler, one of the many elements with which the writers have fun (one character calls George ""a city kid""). The Man in The Yellow Hat, though often in the stereotypical Long-Suffering Parent supporting role, manages to be more than a two-dimensional character. Watch these episodes and the ones that still air on PBS and you'll learn of a full cast of characters, only a couple of which could be called ""cardboard.""

It's always a good morning when my daughter wants to watch, ""Monkey George.""",1183248000,29,1321,4.730434782608696
2712835,5,B000LPS2VI,"I bought this for a long car trip with my 3-year-old son, and it did not disappoint. The stories are appropriate for younger children, and I was pleasantly surprised that my son even enjoys the segments with real children after each episode. (I have tried to forward past them, and he stops me!) As a parent, I like the gentle, loving approach that the adult characters take in dealing with George's mischievous behavior, as well as the emphasis given to George's creativity in solving problems. If your child loves George and his antics, s/he will likely enjoy this video.",1181174400,2,573,4.797979797979798
2712836,5,B000LPS2VI,"This is a great DVD!  However, it is the same cartoon that you can watch daily on PBS Kids.  It is great for the car though because it is VERY long - 8 total episodes with the classroom shorts inbetween.  Highly recommended!",1179100800,,224,4.285714285714286

2712843,5,B000LPS2VI,"This has eight wonderful Curious George stories that my daughter wants to see over and over again.  She is 2, but it would be good for much older kids, too. After each animated story, there is a scene with children learning about something in the story.  The kids look like they are in about 1st grade, so I guess kids up to that age could enjoy this DVD, too.

It is so well done, that my husband and I don't mind the countless repititions our daughter requests.",1176163200,4,463,4.2988505747126435
2712844,5,B000LPS2VI,The PBS series is so well done. The educational aspects are nicely wrapped in  a very entertaining and endearing story. The nice thing is that each story is different so it doesn't suffer the boring repetitive fate of Dora the Explorer. George's innocent curiosity is so like many young kids. I also like that the language is not street slang or sarcastic. Zoo nights is absolutely adorable and animnated with great humor as is all the stories.,1175731200,10,444,4.766233766233766
2712845,4,B000LPS2VI,"These ten minute shorts of extemporized tales based on the original Curious George stories are beautifully done,  and are animated in superb imitation of Rey's drawing style and colour range. Nice to see also that the modern disease of nudge-nudge-wink-wink smugness has not filtered into these little gems. They remain, correctly, as cute and innocent, and with that endangered species, a happy ending. My one considerable reservation is the addition at the end of each story of a puerile children's workshop. My two year daughter who loves 'Dorge' as she calls him, has already worked out how to fast forward to the next tale the moment these banal appendixes commence.  She seemed particularly keen to mimic her pesky father! Very irritating, and I hope Universal Studios tell all those dire experts with their Ph. D's in Infant Education where to go for the next installment. Let these delightful stories stand alone.",1175644800,7,921,5.0927152317880795
