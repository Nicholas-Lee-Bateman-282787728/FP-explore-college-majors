8085282,2,B000BCNJ1O,"OK movie, but for those of us who love (read: dote on) James Dean, this in no way measures up to the other movies and films by and about Dean. If you want a 5-star flick of Dean's life, order ""James Dean"" starring James Franco.  Measuring up to the real James Dean (by portraying him) is actually not possible, but Franco does an admirable job and emanates the Dean essence quite good.",1300579200,,385,4.347222222222222
8085283,2,B000BCNJ1O,"Despite an excellent supporting cast, the made-for-TVer JAMES DEAN: RACE WITH DESTINY (IDed here as ""James Dean Live Fast, Die Young"") is a rather dull piece of (for lack of a better word) fiction. Credit goes in part to first time screenwriter Dan Sefton, a man of small accomplishment since this inauspicious debut.

The picture seems to be more about Pier Angelli than Dean. Casper Van Dien in the title role is pure stink. There's no way around it. He stinks. Whiny Van Dien drives too fast, gets a lot of speeding tickets, moons over Pier, crashes and croaks. That's it. Meanwhile, the viewer has wasted nearly two hours time and three bucks shipping for what is now a shiny silver coffee table coaster.

Even if you're the #1 James Dean fan of all time, --ESPECIALLY if you are-- you'll want to avoid this one.

8085284,1,B000BCNJ1O,"first of all I only bought this movie because it cost a dollar. I'm a dean fan and thought this movie was so badly done. They just threw together alot of famous facts about James dean. They way the filmakers portray Dean an pier's love story is so corny and overdone. If you want to see better versions of a dean movie bio watch the 2001 tv movie with James franco or the

1976 version with Stephen McHattie.",1171065600,4,408,4.230769230769231
