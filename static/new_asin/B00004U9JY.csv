1354752,5,B00004U9JY,Loved it! It is not often you can see a quality video that has incredible  eye candy and set to terrific reggae beat. It's the best of both worlds!,965260800,2,147,4.068965517241379
7923741,4,B00004U9JY,I bought it for Dine Marie Vannoni and she was great in it but it was alot of the same stuff many dance songs and the same dancing through out but I got pretty much what i wanted so not complaining.,1242864000,,198,3.8536585365853657
7923742,5,B00004U9JY,"If you like naked girls and great music, this is the the DVD for you.  In addition to 60 minutes of top professional ""A"" List Adult Superstars (not some kids hanging around a pool with their tops off), you also get a great CD with well know reggae, reggaeton, and rap artists.  Something for everyone in this package.",1130889600,2,317,4.448275862068965
7923743,4,B00004U9JY,"I am sure El Cangri's review is sincere.  However I bought the same DVD/CD package he did, and I was obviously buying it for a different reason than El Cangri.  El Cangri is comparing ""Amateur"" Girls in other videos to at least 4 top ""Adult Porn Stars"" that appear in Fiesta 4.  Roxanne Hill was the number 1 adult porn star for 2 years in a row, Dina Marie Vannoni has been at every major car show, was featured on the Playboy Channel, and various other adult and sports magazines.  Shannan Leigh is seen all the time on the Red Shoe Diaries, Cinemax, Showtime, etc. Molly Steel is on the Playboy Channel all the time (what a body).  The only one I did not know was Caroline ""Singapore"" Chu.  They are dancing to various music including: dance music, reggae music ,pop etc.  The CD contains all Reggae and Reggaeton Music.  What El Cangri is not telling you is that many of the songs on the DVD/CD are from the originators of what is now called Reggaeton. They started the entire ""Reggaeton"" movement  way back in 1985. He also is not telling you that most of the ""Reggaeton"" out there is based on Jamaican Rhythms. The Panamanians borrowed rhythms from Jamaicans, and the Puerto Ricans borrowed rhythms from the Panamanians. I am certainly not taking anything away from the creativity of the Panamanians or Puerto Ricans, but they cannot deny that the movement is based on Jamaican rhythms.  The CD has tracks by Admiral Bailey, and General Degree (Big Time Jamaican Artists), Jan&Suppose, Killer Ranks, Traficantes, Demphra (Well Known Panama Artists), and Several Others.  The DVD has songs from Renato (Soy El Mas Sensual), Reggae Sam, Cocoman (El Marciano), Gaby (Meneaito), and a bunch of other genre's, a couple of songs on the DVD do sound a bit like elevator music, but so what!  It goes with the flow of the naked girls.  The DVD/CD has exactly what is described.  I liked the music on the DVD, and I liked the music on the CD.  It was a good value for $14.50 (I bought it in the amazon marketplace).  I gave it 4 stars because, the backrounds used could have been better, but it seems they focused their efforts on the girls, rather than backrounds.  If you recognize the names of the girls(which I did), it is always nice to see them naked, and it is also nice to actually see them dancing naked instead of having some guy on top of them with the usual ""simulated sex"" scenes.",1117152000,6,2389,4.544392523364486
7923744,1,B00004U9JY,"If there was a ZERO stars option I would choose it.  Production is terrible, and girls are terrible.  Honestly, this genre is ruled by the Reggaeton Goes Wild series as well as the Gatas Sandunguera videos (Dominican Republic should be out now).  Those videos have sexy latinas who can dance their asses off, basically, it's like a strip club on a disk.  These girls don't dance at all.  It is not a turnon at all.  Also, the music is really bad and there is ZERO REGGAETON on the DVD.  It says Reggaeton on the package, but the music on the DVD sounds like bad elevator music.  Please don't buy this piece of garbage.",1116374400,3,618,4.407079646017699
7923745,5,B00004U9JY,"I can only say that it only takes one rotten apple in the barrel to ruin the entire barrel.  A. Can was hopefully unsuccessful in his efforts to destroy the Fiesta 4 DVD/CD.  He has the right to his opinion, even if it has no relevance to the product he reviewed.  Fiesta 4 Party contains a CD with hit Reggaeton, Reggae, Rap and Dance product, the DVD contains 4 well known Adult Stars, plus a well known model, dancing to music with and without their cloths.  It is a very simple concept. What A. Can did not know, and I will now tell him is the fact that the DVD was seen by several hundred thousand people on Action Pay per view a couple years back.  Action Pay Per view does not put on ""amatuerish"" videos.  The main attraction of this product (in addition to the very nice naked girls) is the music.  I could of put up with A. Can's criticism of the ""visuals"", maybe he has different tastes as it relates to women, but his criticism of the music simply means that he does not know what he is talking about,  I will not call him an idiot, but he is certainly coming close.  One of the songs on the DVD, as well as the CD was one of the biggest dance hits around- The Meneaito, the song El Marciano, went number 1 in 20 countries.  Dime Porque was an MTV International pick of the Week.  General Degree and Admiral Bailey are two of the major Artists in the Reggae world.  What was A. Can talking about! Obviously, he did not know what he was talking about.  There are better and worse Adult DVD's out there, but this one has some very good music, and a bonus CD with some great Reggaeton, Reggae, and Dance songs.  For those of you that do not want to pay $20, you can get it for $14.40 at the Amazon market place, or raggaforce.com for under $16 including shipping and handling.  I do not know the others who did reviews, as for me, I am in fact indirectly involved with this product because we sell it and many others in the Amazon market place. I only mention this since he accuses everyone who did a review of somehow being involved with the production.  Talk about paranoia!  I was not involved with the production.  We do in fact sell some stinkers, but this is certainly not one of them.",1102636800,,2199,4.2451923076923075
7923746,4,B00004U9JY,"I bought Fiesta 3 Party because I like Merengue.  They had a promo for Fiesta 4 Party on the DVD, so I eventually bought it.  I noticed a couple of reviews that confused me, so I was motivated to write this review.  First, there is no Cariba on Fiesta 4, Cariba is on Fiesta 3.  So one review is correct- there are no Women of Color on Fiesta 4, but there is a Women of Color on Fiesta 3.  No biggie, but since another reviewer is accusing everyone of being deceitful, I thought I should point this out.

As for the other reviewer.  If he bothered to read the Amazon Editorial, which I did read- the Director wrote and I quote ""What we lack in expensive scenary (there is no expensive scenary), we made up for with great music, and fantastic shots.""

What more does he want them to say. How deceitful it that?

I liked the girls, I liked the music.  I did not have any great expectations, but I was not disappointed with the purchase.  The Editorial review was exactly what I got.",1100044800,6,980,4.243243243243243
7923747,5,B00004U9JY,"I read all the reviews, including A. Can's (he or she clearly did not like the DVD or the CD).  A. Can also does not know anything about Reggaeton, Reggae, Rap or Dance Music, because if they did, they would not have critisized the music!  The music was great! Anyone that has gone to a Latin, Ragga, or Dance club has heard many of these songs.  The Meneaito was one of the first major hits in the Spanish Reggae movement, who does not know Admiral Bailey, and General Degree.  However, A. Can says they suck.  What a clever review!  Obviously Mr., Ms. or Miss Can, was looking for hard core [...] instead of top models dancing to various types of music in the nude.  The only criticism I have is the projection lights sometimes distorted the visuals alittle.  The closeups are crisp and clear.  The lighting is very good, and the sound on the CD is excellent. The music on the DVD kept the visuals flowing at a nice pace and helped set the mood (whatever mood you wanted)  A. Can is a tough person to please.  If you like Playboy or Penthouse videos (which lack great music, but have more expensive backrounds), then you will like Fiesta 4, and for that matter Fiesta 3.  These are all well known Adult Stars, not ""B"" Class stars, but the ""A"" list.  The music far exceeds that found on any other Adult Video.  What A. Can was looking for probably does not exist, when he or she finds it, let us all know.  I would love to see what A. Can  considers ""perfect girls"" or even ""O.K."" girls, as well as what they think ""good"" music is.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and there is some definite eye candy to watch.  Different strokes for different folks, that is what life is all about, so if you are looking for something kinky A. Can, then look elsewhere, because this ain't kinky, it is just some nice babes, [...]",1100044800,7,1821,4.337278106508876
7923748,5,B00004U9JY,"I bought the VHS several years ago, and subsequently bought the DVD/CD package.  While I respect A. Can's right to his opinion, the review does not make sense to me.

1.) Dina Marie Vannoni is a major Adult Superstar and Model.
2.) Roxanne Hill was voted the number 1 Porn Star 2 years in a row
3.) Molly Steele is on Playboy Channel all the time.
4.) Shannon Leigh is on Cinemax almost every other week, and is featured in the Red Shoe Diaries.
5.) The Music is from the of the top Artists in their genre's including:
General Degree, Admiral Baily, The worldwide hit Meneaito, and many more.
6.) You also got Caroline aka: Caroline ""Singapore"" Chu, a major International Model.

I read the reviews, and they did not say anything unbelieveable or anything that would deceive anyone.

The one criticism I would have is that they did not spend alot of money on backrounds, it looks like they focused their efforts on the camera work, lighting, makeup, music and editing. This product does in fact contain 5 Gorgeous Naked Women dancing to Reggae, R&B, Reggaeton and Dance Music.  If you were looking for hardcore porn, this was most certainly the wrong product for you. It is what it is, nothing more, nothing less.

You got a 1 hour DVD with well known, world class Adult Stars, plus a 1 hour CD with hit Reggae, Reggaeton, and Rap Music. What exacly did you expect besides what you got.

Let me also say that the Editorial Description describes exactly what you get, lists the girls names, etc.  How were you deceived.",1100044800,9,1518,4.575645756457565
7923749,1,B00004U9JY,"I am sorry but other reviewers should somehow participated in the making of this dvd, otherwise my capabilities don't allow me to understand their ratings. BAD music, Cheap Stars, terrible ambience, background sucks so much, NOTHING in here... Did I mention how the music sucks ??? Damn, I am sorry for my 20 bucks. Do not waste your money and time on this amateurly produced DVD... BEWARE.",1098057600,10,390,4.835820895522388
