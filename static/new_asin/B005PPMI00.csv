Not enough? Okay, then throw in some skeezy William Shatner, a tap-dancing/baseball-catching superhero duo, and some Indiana Jonesin' with Despereaux. Still nothing? Fine, we'll include hijinks when Gus joins a cult, Lassie gets a girlfriend, and Shawn checks into the looney bin.

Still not convinced? Then add some mystery white powder, an explosion-propelled leap into a swimming pool, a murdered donut, a crushed Blueberry, and you've got yourself another sweet season of Psych.",1459382400,,565,5.635294117647059

4856914,5,B005PPMI00,"You will know by the time you get to the 6th season of the show whether you like it or not.  It found a formula that worked for it (case of the week, with random spoof/homage episodes thrown in and continuing character development) and did not really deviate from it.  They got even better being absurdly funny at one moment (such as the vampire episode with the original Buffy Kristy Swanson) to extreme drama (like the cliff hanger of the season finale), and sometimes managed to do it in the same episode.  The standout episode of the season were, to me, This Episode Sucks, which was the vampire episode, Heeeere's Lassie, a shining inspired episode with Tim Omundson and Dule Hill in a great chase sequence, and Indiana Shawn and the Temple of Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger, which is spoofing exactly what you think, and saw the return of Cary Elwes, and guest starred the nearly ageless Mdchen  Amick.

If you really like the show, you will realistically like every episode.  I definitely think the series benefited from having shorter seasons.  Had each season had 22 episode runs all the way through it would have likely got much more stale, but since they kept the number of episodes at 16 or less, I never felt that it got too repetitive.  And, they kept coming up with funny and original stories that even when they went back to older characters and continued story lines, they never did the same thing twice.

For those who do get the DVDs, the extras are pretty much the same as in prior seasons.  There are definitely not as many audio commentaries for episodes, but each one does have a video commentary with the writers, there are deleted scenes for most of the episodes and a gag reel.  All in all a lot of extra material for those who like going through all that stuff. If you have liked the show up to this point, I think you will like this season, and if you like the extras the DVDs are definitely worth adding to your collection.",1457740800,4,1952,4.517045454545454

Whenever I want to watch Psych, my first choice is season 6. I very often watch Last Night Gus and Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger, which are two of my favorite episodes of the entire series. I have had this season for 2 years now, and watched it many times, and its never gotten old.
  I liked this product so much because it is hilarious! The jokes never get old, and theres also the action of catching criminals. The acting in this is great, especially because the actors work so well together, especially Dule Hill and James Roday. There are also several cameo appearances, including Cary Elwes(The Princess Bride) and several others.
  There are many hilarious jokes in this season, and they are geared to pretty much all audiences. This is the best of all the Psych seasons, and I suggest you buy it as soon as possible.",1446508800,,999,4.442622950819672

4856929,5,B005PPMI00,"Fantastic series and season six is just as funny and entertaining as each of the previous seasons. This one has a new challenge though - the problem: how do Shawn and Juliette maintain the secrecy of their relationship. After all, they work closely together professionally and the relationship would be inappropriate.

I really enjoy the audio commentary and deleted scenes. But my favorite part is the video commentary performed by the creator Steve Franks and the executive producers and versatile writers. Franks is especially interesting as evinced by his obvious enjoyment with the behind-the-scenes workings of the series and each great episode.

The setting Santa Barbara, although used in the openers, is actually beautiful Vancouver, B.C. with an occasional portable palm tree.",1438732800,,786,5.434426229508197

4856935,5,B005PPMI00,"What can I say about Psych? From the first episode to this season, it never fails to entertain me. I love this show so much that I wished it didn't end. Every time I miss Shawn and Gus, I spend the whole weekend watching the whole 8 season. Love everyone in that show.",1433635200,,268,4.0754716981132075
4856936,5,B005PPMI00,"Some shows run out of steam after four or five years.  But psych doesnt seem to be having that problem.  This comedic mystery is still going as strongly as ever, and fans will love every minute of season six.

If you happen to be new to the show, it follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday).  The man was trained by his father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen), to be a super observant cop.  But Shawn is rebellious in his own right and has spent his life floating from one job to another until he lands at consulting for the Santa Barbara Police Department.  He and his best friend Gus (Dule Hill) have opened Psych, a private psychic detective agency.  Shawn turns his observations into visions that he then uses to help the police solve crime.  Its something he is good at, but its also just enough of a jab at his father to make it acceptable to him.  Henry and Gus are the only ones who know he is not really psychic, and they play along with the ruse.

Rounding out the cast, we have Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) and the two detectives that Shawn usually helps.  Theres Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who cant stand the fact that this psychic usually solves the case before he does.  Then theres Detective Juliette OHara (Maggie Lawson), who is finally dating Shawn.

One reason this show has maintained the humor and comedy is the themed episodes.  Shawn goes undercover as a patient in an insane asylum to prove a murder suspect isn't crazy and can't use the insanity defense.  In another episode, Gus finds himself masquerading as the mascot of a baseball team to help them find the killer.  Lassiter must reluctantly ask for help when his new apartment building is turning him crazy ala The Shining.  And in the best themed episode, an antiquity is stolen from the local museum, and the search for it becomes a fun spoof of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

The show prides itself on its 80s references and jokes, and those are still in full force here.  The show is as much about the comedy as it is the mystery.  In fact, sometimes the mystery suffers a bit at the expense of the humor, but I just go along for the ride and enjoy whats there because the show it always entertaining.

My complaint about the last three seasons still holds true.  Cary Elwes makes his third guest appearance on the show, and again there is not one Princess Bride joke.  But since it is in the Indiana Jones episode, Ill let it pass this time.  Hopefully, hell show up again in an episode filled with them.  It shouldnt take Miracle Max to make that happen.

In other fun guest star, we finally meet Juliette's dad, as played by William Shatner in a couple of episodes.

The show has first and foremost been a buddy show, and Shawn and Gus relationship is as strong as ever.  I was worried that when Shawn and Juliette started dating, it would hurt their dynamic, but it hasnt.  There are a couple of episodes that do deal with them directly, like a weekend away that turns deadly and a case from Juliettes past where Shawn is trying to prove she got the wrong person.

As always, the acting is wonderful on the show.  From what I can tell, the entire cast gets along extreme well (James and Maggie are even dating in real life).  I know James and Dule have become good friends.  It shows on the screen.  There is a chemistry that creates pure magic when a cast gets along, and it is here.  Whether scream in terror (Shawn and Gus) playing things for laughs (everyone on one time or another), or working on a serious murder, every moment is believable.

My only real complaint is the increased presence of Woody, the coroner (Kurt Fuller).  I usually find his scenes painful since his character just isn't as funny as everyone else seems to think he is.  Having said that, he plays a huge part in a Hangover spoof episode, and that episode was very funny.

Seasons of this show usually consist of sixteen episodes, and season six was no exception.  They are all part of this set on the four discs enclosed.  And they have the widescreen and full surround fans have come to expect.  Fans also expect some nice extras, and this set comes through again.  We've got deleted and extended scenes, including two extended episodes.  Of course, there's a gag reel.  The crew does an introductory video commentary on all sixteen episodes, and there are traditional commentaries with various members of the cast and crew on eight of the episodes, or half the season.  And let's not forget the featurettes.  Okay, so they've got one of the ""psychouts"" and a montage of one liners from the season.  However, they also have a behind the scenes look at the Indiana Jones episode.  All in all, this will keep you busy for quite some time.

Psych has always set out to be just plain fun, and that continues with season six.  If you are a fan, youll be thrilled with what is here.  And if you are looking for a light, funny show, youve found it.  Sit back and prepare to laugh.",1433635200,,4935,4.486516853932584

4857041,5,B005PPMI00,"Psych is one of the best shows ever, and this season has lots of treats for longtime fans, with the most delightful bits based on subtle references to past episodes and well entrenched personality traits of Shawn and Gus.  As any Psych fan will attest, the chemistry between Shawn/James and Gus/Dule is the true magic of the show, but the whole cast is perfect, and the hugely talented writers obviously enjoy their work.  The theme song is also one of the best ever, and this season has more variations plus an awesome comic book style opener for the superhero episode.  (I do miss Liam James as young Shawn, though, but kids grow up and go into the movie business, so what are you gonna do?)",1374105600,,693,4.528

But then I began to appreciate the humor and maybe it had a ring of real life, the insecurities, the nerviness, the optimism. James Roday, and Dule Hill do a good job playing off the other characters. It's hard not to become hooked on all the quirky people in this show.",1373414400,,377,4.178082191780822

The way they get into, and out of, trouble and yet still manage to solve the case is amusing and entertaining. This is truly one of those rare shows where you can get lost for an hour from reality and have a real good time. Season 6 builds on the other 5 seasons and the way in which the show is kept fresh is very enjoyable and makes for great entertainment.",1372723200,,488,3.989795918367347

4857052,4,B005PPMI00,"I've owned and watched all six seasons of Psych but for some reason I just couldn't get much into this one.  Maybe I'm growing up or maybe the show is getting a bit long in the tooth.  I noticed that there is a cliff-hanger in the last seconds of the last episode to get you to want to watch season seven.  Sorry, I won't say what it is, you'll have to watch it yourself.  Worth the price if you are a fan of the show.",1372118400,,418,3.8823529411764706

I'm afraid the interaction with Julia (Jules) has taken something away from the show.  Maggie Lawson, Timothy Omundson and Corbin Bernsen are still perfect, but they aren't the stars of the show like Roday and Hill.  To put it another way, instead of laughing all the time, I was laughing only some of the time.",1370908800,,471,4.318181818181818

4857062,5,B005PPMI00,Shawn and Gus are regular visitors to our living room. They make us laugh in every episode and the interpersonal relationships among characters in the show are just real enough for most people to relate to. I recommend this show to mystery buffs -- especially if you don't like all the gore present in many other mystery shows.,1369699200,,327,4.655172413793103

You either love or hate it.  But to me, Shawn and Gus make the show -- they work perfectly together.  And the writing and constant 80's reference always have my wife and me laughing hysterically in each episode.

It's amazing to me that, as the storyline progresses between the characters, the premise of the whole show hasn't stalled for me.  Both my wife and I look forward to watching this every week, and we buy the seasons and watch all the extras.  We're just big fans, and I think that's what happens with this kind of show...it gets a cult following exactly because of the love-it-or-hate-it value.",1367539200,,772,4.550724637681159

Fans of Gus and Shawn will be happy. People who don't like referential humor won't get it. I foresee many repeat viewings at our house.",1364774400,,302,4.716981132075472

Pop culture references and ridiculous best friend antics without being too goofy.  The random references to 80's pop culture, music, movies, celebrities (which we called stars back then), make this show the best on tv.  We are always chomping at the bit for the next season.

4857108,5,B005PPMI00,"I have immensely enjoyed every season of ""Psych"" from its pilot episode on, but Season Six takes this series on a rocket ship, busts it through the stratosphere of hilarity and weirdness, and takes it to a whole new realm of awesomeness. It's official: ""Psych"" is now my favorite show.

The writers and cast really turned it up to eleven for this one, and every episode of this season had me in stitches. Some of my favorite moments:

-""Last Night Gus"" is an amazing spoof of a ""Hangover"" type plot, and it enabled us to view Lassie, Woody, and ""Pops"" in a whole new dynamic, as their wonderful relationships with Shawn and Gus were explored on a roller coaster ride of comic genius. One of my favorite ""Psych"" episodes of all time.

-Shawn and Gus dressing up to infiltrate a vampire themed club in ""This Episode Sucks"" (hilarious name for an episode). (""Black-ula?! You must be out of your damn mind! -Gus)

-A delightful spoof of the classic horror novel/movie, ""The Shining"", with the episode ""Heeeeere's Lassie!""

-The reunion of the musical group ""Quarter Black"" (""That name still makes no sense, Shawn."" -Gus), featuring none other than an adult Erkel.

-A fantastic take on the classic film noir genre/era with ""Autopsy Turvy"".

-Shawn and Gus joining a cult in order to solve a murder mystery, featuring such gems as ""I'm washing my bloomers in the creek... well, they're community bloomers"" (Shawn) and ""I'm going to need to interrogate your entire herd of weirdos, Eli"" (Lassie).

-Shawn's hilarious attempt to go undercover as an assistant coach for a minor league baseball team in ""Dead Man's Curve Ball"" (another great name for an episode).

-Gus' unrepentant candy binge in ""Santabarbaratown"", in which he downs gummy bears, m&ms, and other assorted chocolates, after already inflcting what Shawn estimates to be ""six hundred dollars in damages to a mini bar"".

-The assumption of ""super-hero"" (I use that term loosely) alter egos for Shawn and Gus in ""The Amazing Psych Man and Tap Man, Issue #2"". There is perhaps nothing funnier than this delightful duo assuming the roles of ""Tap Man"" and ""The Catch"". Except possibly for Shawn implementing his trademark ""combat"" technique of ""going boneless"" in order to slow down his enemies.

Season Six of ""Psych"" simply can't be beat... it will go down as one of the finest moments in the history of the USA Network, and even that of parent company NBC.",1360195200,,2411,4.85609756097561

We enjoy Psych because its good clean fun, this season however seemed to have more swearing, Gus was not as funny (seemed less like the funny scared-y cat) and there were more inappropriate jokes. Also they made Gus out to be this weird little perv that was just annoying.  We enjoyed watching this show with our nephew but now we have to watch the show first to make sure the episodes are appropriate, kind of a bummer.

Maybe it was the long wait or maybe it was just because it was so totally awesome, but I loved it! Despereaux came back (though it looks as if we won't be seeing him again) and he is one of my favorite villains. Yin and Yang are gone, Shawn and Jules are together, and life couldn't be better in Santa Barbara. Of course, that's never actually true. They wouldn't have a show if it was! I reccomend this show to anyone and everyone! Though the ending was WAY too cliffhangery. Want spoilers? Look somewhere else. :P",1358640000,,644,4.2439024390243905

4857132,4,B005PPMI00,"I'm a recent convert to PSYCH, and so I've got serious catching up to do. It's Season 6 of the USA Network's currently longest running show. Despite Shawn Spencer's amazing psychic sleuthing act, Santa Barbara, California is still very much crime-infested. And that suits us fine. I'd initially dismissed PSYCH as a series that's too goofy and over-the-top. But I went thru Season 5 and realized that PSYCH does have dramatic flair, that occasional sense of gravity. I'm a sucker for romance so my way in was the game-changing growth in Shawn and Juliet's relationship. Season 6 continues to advance that relationship. I really liked the polygraph test sequence in the opening episode (""Shawn Rescues Darth Vader""). In that sequence, Lassiter has got Shawn strapped to a lie detector and thinks him cornered. Instead we get a wonderful moment with Shawn and an onlooking Juliet.

PSYCH's calling card is its self-aware shamelessness and its wit and its relentless pop culture referencing. Given, I roll my eyes at Shawn's trademark raising of hand to temple as he demonstrates his ""psychic"" skills. Thankfully, his and Gus's goofing around frequently generates big laughs. (For a few weeks, I was going around, saying ""C'mon, son"" to everyone.) And just when you think they've wandered too far into silly territory again, here comes the shocking season finale. PSYCH ending on a dark note? You know that's right.

My favorite Season 6 episodes:

- ""Shawn Rescues Darth Vader"" - Mostly for Shawn's polygraph test sequence but also for Shawn's casual abuse of his temporary diplomatic immunity.

- ""Last Night Gus"" - PSYCH's nod to THE HANGOVER; After attending a cop's retirement party, Shawn, Gus, Lassie, and SBPD's weirdo coroner Woody Strode wake up with no recollection of what happened the night before.

- ""The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2"" - PSYCH's nod to superheroes; A costumed vigilante called The Mantis is nabbing crooks and making SBPD and Shawn look superfluous. Gus as ""Tap Man"" is freakin' hilarious.

- ""In for a Penny..."" - Awesome, awesome Juliet O'Hara-centric episode. William Shatner plays Juliet's estranged con artist dad who's trying to ingratiate himself back into her life. Fantastic emotional beats delivered by Shatner and Maggie Lawson.

- ""Neil Simon's Lover's Retreat"" - Another great ep. Shawn and Juliet go on a romantic getaway, so naturally a corpse pops up. Keep an eye out for the nightclub sequence as Gus, Lassie, and Henry compete in a bet.

- ""Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger"" - PSYCH'S nod to Indiana Jones, but also featuring the return of dashing master thief Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes). Also guest-stars John Rhys-Davies (""Sallah"" from the Indiana Jones films).

- ""Heeeeere's Lassie"" - Focus on Det. Carlton Lassiter who hires Shawn and Gus to investigate a possible haunting in his new condo. This episode spoofs THE SHINING, POLTERGEIST, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and even GHOSTBUSTERS. Guest-starring William Shatner who shows up for a few minutes.

- ""Santabarbaratown"" - PSYCH's nod to film noir like CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL.

PSYCH - THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON has its 16 episodes on 4 discs. The bonus stuff:

- Cast & Crew Audio Commentaries on 8 episodes: ""Shawn Rescues Darth Vader,"" ""Last Night Gus,"" ""This Episode Sucks,"" ""In for a Penny...,"" ""Neil Simon's Lover's Retreat,"" ""Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger,"" ""Heeeeere's Lassie,"" and ""Santabarbaratown""
- Writers' Video Commentaries on all 16 episodes
- Deleted/Extended Scenes for 11 episodes
- Gag Reel (00:04:11 minutes)
- 4 montage clips of Shawn and Gus's shenanigans focusing on their favorite phrases, names Shawn comes up with to introduce Gus to strangers, Gus's food obsession, jokes that didn't make the final cut, and pop culture references (totaling 00:05:20 minutes)
- ""Underground with PSYCH"" - look at the set of the hidden underground treasure room from ""Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger"" with production designer Eric Norlin and art director Jennifer Donaldson (00:04:04 minutes)
- ""Psychouts - California Survivor Man Audition Applicant #633"" - Dule Hill, James Roday, and Maggie Lawson goof around in a 40-second promotional skit",1358553600,,4275,5.161849710982659
4857133,5,B005PPMI00,"We received our CD package and it was BROKEN and of the 4 CD's, 2 were visibly scratched.  So I went online, located this order and filed my complaint - within 15 MINUTES, I received an Email stating they have ""reordered"" it an not cost.  We just need to go to our Amazon Account and ""return"" the broken merchandise.  In the return link - we just had to click ""UPS will pick it up from our House"" and guess what, UPS knocked on our door 2 days later and retrieved the broken CD Package.

Our NEW CD package was received 3 days after I had filed my complaint on Amazon.com thru my account.  PLEASE NOTE:  Amazon by far is the standard of efficient and excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE.  No where else can you do this without having to call someone or go through hoops to explain something is broken.  Wow - I am beyond satisfied - I can do an Amazon Commercial for free just to tell everyone HOW AWESOME THE customer experience is.  Just so we are all on the same page, my definition of awesome is as follows:

1)  I order something online,
2)  I receive it in good order at my House,
3)  If not in good order, I go back to my Account online and look for a way to provide feedback that directly tied to the ""not in good order"" product.  AND IT'S THERE ON AMAZON.COM in ""Your Orders"".
4)  I am able to TYPE a summary of my problem and I expect it to be taken cared of (meaning, I do not want to be on the phone to tell someone or ask someone) - simply since I ordered it without speaking to someone.  AND IT'S THERE ON AMAZON.COM.
5)  That I also have an option to ""click"" somebody come get this from my House since it is NOT my fault it was broken as it arrived broken.  AND YES, AMAZON.COM has that TOO.....seriously (I was beyond shocked but very very HAPPY with Amazon and the options - WOW is all I can say).

4857142,3,B005PPMI00,"I loved the season it was very alluring and then romantic. One thing that was a huge twist to me is how (spoilers maybe) the cast turned out to be some kind of disrespectful sickos in a way. The jokes were way too much for me sometimes the mentioned jokes I wouldn't recommend little kids to hear at all. That turned out to be a huge shock for me I did NOT expect the director to have this mindset. Makes me scared to buy the 7th season because of it cause I know it might be worse. Then I hope a few other customers have talked to him about it maybe he'll be a little more mild next time.
The crimes and stories were awesome and shocking quite a few unexpected. But it was the jokes that took this show for me from 5 to 3 stars for me. The cast were great and what not but the jokes were too far out there and I didn't appreciate to have to hear it.

Other then that the episodes were cool the story was great and quite a few unexpected things happened.",1357516800,3,954,3.994764397905759

4857157,4,B005PPMI00,"I didn't catch onto Psych until the end of Season 4 and immediately this became one of my favorite shows of the last several years. I have since gone back and collected the entire series on DVD. This isn't a complicated or contemplative show; it's just solid great fun week in and week out. It's especially nice to see a show like this earn a long reliable stretch on the air without the constant struggle for survival that other favorites fall victim to on other networks. I can't help but think that, had shows like NBC's Chuck been launched at USA instead of a broadcast network, we could still enjoy 7, 8 or more seasons as we will get to enjoy with Psych.

The DVDs have been great - certainly above average in the quantity and quality of extra features. I love the cast commentaries, which are ample, as well as the obligatory gag reel (which is never long enough). The one great puzzlement for me though is why only one Psych-Out? Each episode ends with one of these wonderful weekly outtakes, yet they are all missing from the DVD save for one. Notably missing from this season is Roday's epic bust-out over an extra with a bottle of Coke. It just seems a no-brainer to me that you would include all the Psych-Outs on the DVD collection. It just seems to me that many tv networks have begun skimping more and more on the extras packed into their DVD collections (certainly not just this series or this network). For that reason alone, I have to drop a star from the overall rating. But still, for any fan of the show, each season on DVD is a must and I would always recommend them even if they contained nothing more than the episodes themselves.",1356480000,3,1654,4.440789473684211

This season was a huge failure, and not just because I'm not a fan of Shules. The storylines were boring and predictable, they downgraded Shawn's intelligent and personality as a whole, too much Shules rubbish and not enough of the crazy duo I got into the show for, not enough Karen Vick or Henry screen time, rarely any flashbacks (Shawn-Henry moments is one of the main reasons I watch this show), even the cinematography threw me off. Too many changes (bad changes) happening in this season alone; not to mention, as of season 4, this show became incredibly inconsistent. And I thought season 5 was bad. The show just lost energy and its spark in this season alone.
The only exception was ""Last Night Gus"" which was actually very psych-esque and enjoyable to watch. Apart from that, I deny the very existence of this season.

I don't know what happened to the writers, or whether they were fired after season 3, but BRING THEM BACK, so that they can bring back all the amazing elements that made Psych a great show in the first place.

I have NEVER been so disappointed in a TV series before!!! NEVER!!! THEY HAVE CHANGED THE ENTIRE SHOW. The rest of the cast is seen very little...and ""Sean"" and ""Gus"" TRY to carry the entire show with added ""special effects"", which I guess is suppose to make the show better, but it is AWFUL!!! The storylines are awful...nothing to them...just boring.

It seems to be an ego trip for Sean and Gus and I am sorry but the other characters, along WITH Sean and Gus, is what MADE the show great! It was funny, sensitive, very tongue-in-cheek with great storylines...it is now BORING!!! These two guys cannot carry the show alone... they are NOT that funny or entertaining.

And you have to watch the episodes in a sort of ""order"" starting with the first season and watching a few more episodes before the last season to get a feel for the show. The first episode is probably the worst, but the episodes get more and more exciting, funny, and addicting. Psych also leaves you on a hook at the end of every season.

Few of such are: ""The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man"", ""Dead Man's Curveball"", ""Indiana Shawn And The Temple Of..."", ""Let's Doo-Wap it Again"", "" Autopsy Turvy"", and many more.
Compared to earlier seasons, in this season both Shawn and Gus are less-funny-more-silly, forget about being 'interesting' characters.

""Last Night Gus,"" ""This Episode S#cks,"" ""Neil Simon's Lovers Retreat,"" ""Here's Lassie!"" and ""Santabarbaratown"" are just some of the standouts this season.

Shawn and Gus are at their funniest (if not a little self-gratifyingly done this season) but the laughs are consistent, the nods to pop culture blatant and classic.  And the last episode?  Well, let's just say that's a cliffhanger that has left everybody who is a fan of this show on the edge of their seat waiting for Season 7 (back February 2013).

The catch phrases for this year seem off to me.

Another reviewer referred to Late Night Gus being the best episode of Psych - it really is up there in the list of best episodes.  However, the 2nd appearance of Blackapella isn't as strong as the first.  Really missed Joon.

Quite pleased that the finale did not have anything to do with Yin or Yang or his new blonde apprentice.  We do get a cliffhanger.  Wojo, Wojo, Wojo.  As soon as I saw an old Barney Miller cop, I knew what was going to happen.

Another fantastic episode is ""Heeere's Lassie"", the Psych version of ""The Shining.""  By the way the cliffhanger at the end of the season was a shocker that I didn't expect from Psych but it is also very well done.

When they wake up the next day Lassiter thinks he may have killed a man. The rest is hilarious backtrace to find out what might of happened.

Season 6 is still fantastically funny, with great acting, great stories, but I really can't get over how fat Shawn Spencer has gotten. In season 1 he was a beautiful man. I don't want to be mean, but he is hard to look at now, I winced when he lost his sleeves in the super Mantis episode.

4857238,5,B005PPMI00,"Accidently watched this show back in February and have been a huge fan ever since. Have purchased every season.  Absolutely love James Roday!  He is the cutest and funniest person on TV.  He is also a very very good actor.  Along with the laughs there have been some tears with his performances.  I have really enjoyed the evolution of his relationship with his dad.  As for the rest of the cast - Fantastic! Gus - adorable, Lassie - a riot, Woody - a complete riot!  They all play so well off of each other. The writers are great!  ""Last Night Gus"" has to be the funniest episode ever!  The season finale was amazing and Henry better be ok!

4857241,5,B005PPMI00,I am a long time fan of Psych and Amazon. This was a fast and easy purchase using Amazon prime. Last Night Gus is a must see episode (beyond hilarious).,1346457600,,152,4.1
4857242,5,B005PPMI00,"DUDE!  Over the history of television, few shows have been able to keep up the momentum season after season, but Psych is consistant in delivering the goods.  I have no doubt season 7 will provide the same quality, and same humor and best guest stars out there.  This season the 2nd episode, ""Late Night Gus"" was perfection, I was shrieking and laughing thru the whole show!! Shawn, Gus, Lassie & Woody re-living the night before to reconstruct a crime was fab, but the scene of them walking (swaggering actually) side by side was absolute perfection!  And poor Gus & his perfect apartment... fortunately he probbably has nitro glycerine on hand.
Little on tv these days provides the entertainment level Psych brings.  If you are a fan, I can add little more to your enthusiasm, if you have never seen this show, start any season and sit back have a rocking good time and be prepared-you will be hooked forever. I hope these guys never grow up.  And I hope Henry used his gear,this show never disappoints & Henry is a cop thru & thru so I am execting a stunning first pisode.",1346198400,,1075,4.572916666666667
4857243,5,B005PPMI00,"What's not to love about Psych?  ""Last Night Gus"" seems like a take off on the Ocean's 12 and 13 movies only in episode form with the world's best cast. Clooney and Pitt?  Na[...]  Spencer and Guster.  Yeaaaaa.",1346112000,,210,4.447368421052632
4857244,5,B005PPMI00,"This show has continuously been snubbed over the years for award shows such as the Emmy's and Golden Globes.  Although I don't give much weight to award shows, it's still a shame.  This is definitely one of the funniest and most original comedies on television, and completely underrated.

I think the the whole ""fake psychic"" concept and the goofiness of Shawn turns some people off.  It's a little silly (purposely), but typically takes a few episodes to get into and realize that the silliness is purposeful and well done.  Give it a chance.  Also - the show has gotten BETTER over the years, and it's almost in its 7th season.  How many shows can you say about that?  It's at its peak.

What is better?  Compare one of the first few episodes to a current one.  The writing is better, the jokes are more humorous, and the characters better developed and fleshed out.  Detective Juliet O'Hara and Shawn Spencer are also in a relationship now, and while I don't believe it will last forever due to ""breaking the formula"" of the show (think Monk), but it's subtle enough where it's not butting into the storyline.  While I love the characters of Juliet and Shawn and really like the pairing, I don't want too much romance or mush around it.  And I honestly prefer Shawn/Gus interactions or Shawn/Henry interactions compared to him and Juliet.

Also, Woody the Coroner (Kurt Fuller) also has a bit more screen-time this season, and he's a really enjoyable character that adds to the cast.  I definitely would like to see more of him.  The characters storylines intertwine more and the pop culture references and parody episodes have risen over time, which I truly love.  There's nothing funnier than seeing Psych mess around with it's opening theme song.

Never seen the show before?  It's fairly easy to get into without seeing previous episodes, although it's recommended so you can empathize with them better.  There is a slight amount of background history, but not too much (although some shows will have subtle references to early episodes) to make it impossible to watch without seeing most of them beforehand.  The major changes in the story this far are Juliet O'Hara and Shawn Spencer starting a relationship, and Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen) coming out of retirement to join the SBPD.  A little different, but not super plot-altering.

What I love about this show is the ""little things"" you can count on to happen.

*Most episodes have a pineapple in it, a Psych thing they've been doing ever since the season 1 premiere (find the pineapple!)
*80s references are just dropped everywhere.  If you were a teen in the 80s you will really connect to this type of humor.
*Gus is super emotional and cries whenever someone else does, no matter who it is. lol.
*Shawn always introduces Gus by a hilarious name.
*Shawn and Gus love to eat food, and are notorious for finding food on the job and at inappropriate times.

The writers deserve way more acclaim than they've been given.  You can tell the amount of effort they put into every episode, which you definitely can't say about all of the generic garbage network sitcoms that get MUCH more attention.  Accept it's goofiness and you'll see the genius, hilariousness, and cleverness behind it.  Most of it is a PARODY of things, and a very clever one at that.  If you are super unfamiliar with the 80s you may find it less enjoyable due to not understanding the references (although they have 90s and current references as well), but I was born in the late 80s (don't get a lot of the jokes) and still love it to death.

Oh, and you can always count on Psych to give you awesome guest stars that were popular in the 80s.  Some guest stars this season are Joey McIntyre, Kenan Thompson, Jaleel White, Corey Feldmen, Danny Glover, Molly Ringwald, Mekhi Phifer, and MANY others.

As usual, the acting is great.  James Roday and Dule Hill as Shawn and Gus may be one of the best ""bromances"" I've seen on in a show in....forever?  At least comically.  They are hilarious together.  Corbin Bernsen as Shawn's father is great as usual. Juliet and Shawn are one of the cutest couples on television, and I love how Juliet is a strong woman who doesn't use her looks and sexuality to get what she wants.  She's a great female role model type and I like her character's modesty.  Timothy Omundson is hilarious as the uptight, All-American cop, Lassiter, and has become more likable over the seasons.

Psych first aired around the time that Monk almost ended, and it was a great move on USA Networks's part.  It is the perfect example of a ""feel good murder mystery show,"" where it's revolved around dead bodies and murder, but it somehow light-hearted and hilarious, never leaving you in a poor mood.  If you enjoyed Monk, you'll probably enjoy this if you give it a chance.

Great show and I hope it continues for seasons to come.  It's getting better and better!",1345939200,17,4910,4.697892271662764

This TV series is well known for its thoughtful humor and wit, but this episode specifically will make all the others look like a three hour documentary on the history of I-80. EVERY scene is packed with one-liners, clever retorts, and general tomfoolery that's guaranteed to push your bladder to the brim not even 5 minutes in.

If you're interested in the show and wanna get a feel for what it's all about (and... don't want to start from the Pilot for some reason), or if you're just trying introduce your friends and family to it, this is THE go-to episode.",1341446400,,800,4.555555555555555

You'll pick up lots of smart-aleck comments, 80's references, and hilarious quips that you didn't get the first time around.

4857265,5,B005PPMI00,"This episode features the trademark Psych style....somebody you think is guilty only to find out the person really wasnt, some intentional over the top acting and interaction between Shawn and Gus that really makes the show, etc...

You get to see the relationship between Shawn and Juliet really begin to blossom while still staying true to the characters. Lassiter just keeps becoming a better and better character.

So, the basic premise is that Shawn's dad was the lead investigator in what remained an unsolved murder. Flash forward to present day and the body of the person they suspected to have been murdered was found along with the body of the alleged murderer's dad as well. Things get dangerous in this one, and although the murders are solved, the ending begins with Shawn's dad retiring for good as a cop and as a consultant, leaving it all behind in a state of depression...and then the ending happened, and i will just say, it was completely unexpected and the perfect cliffhanger as well. You will think upon it for a while afterwards.

4857285,5,B005PPMI00,"Shawn and Julia are taking the next step in their relationship - a romantic weekend getaway funded by Gus' Capital One credit card. Shawn is happy to be with Julia, but not happy to entertain a couple that muscles in on their private time. Left on their own, Gus, Henry and Lassiter have a competitive boys night out that ends in disaster for one of the guys. The two groups converge when there is a murder at a winery. The romantic getaway itself ends with some unfinished business. Great episode.",1323993600,2,498,4.544444444444444
4857286,5,B005PPMI00,"This is one of the most entertaining shows on the air.  No it won't change your life.  No it won't launch you into a paradoxical tirade about life the universe and everything.  What it will do is make you laugh, snort, chuckle, groan and giggle.  Shawn and Gus are 2 of the most endearing characters around. They have good hearts and are always trying to do good (mostly). I am constantly amazed at how silly this show can be and then turn around and have me on the edge of my seat wondering how they are going to get out of the mess they've gotten themselves into.  I marvel at how touching it can be too, (especially the scenes with Shawn's mom and the ones with Juliet) and then slap me in the face with some random ridiculous '80's reference that makes me glad that my personal memories of that time have been shoved back to the far reaches of my mind! Season 6, as it is so far, has been all of these things and more. The relationships have grown (or groan, I've heard it both ways!) so as to keep you coming back for more and the stories are perplexing and intriguing enough to keep you from falling asleep. Still not rocket science. It's not supposed to be. Personally I know people like Shawn and Gus....in fact, I might be a little like Shawn and Gus... and I think that's a good thing!",1323734400,64,1295,4.2693877551020405
4857287,5,B005PPMI00,"Psych rarely goes on location, but when they do it is a nice change of pace. A beautiful hippie named Nicole witnesses a murder, but cannot provide enough information for the police to investigate. Gus volunteers himself and Shawn to scope out the crime scene. In the process, The murderer tries to run Nicole over. Back at the commune farm Nicole calls home, Gus falls under the spell of the cult and Nicole while Shawn investigates the murder with the help of his father, Juliet and Lassiter. This was a nice episode outside of Santa Barbara, but I have to admit I missed more screen time with Henry and the other regulars in the police station.",1323302400,,647,4.586206896551724
4857288,5,B005PPMI00,"Great episode again. This one takes place in a rural setting without seeing much of the familiar faces at the police station. However, I still enjoyed it and had some good laughs. Amazon had excellent quality on the stream for me as well.",1323302400,,238,4.558139534883721
4857289,5,B005PPMI00,"Name two detectives who would take $500 from a kid to recover his collectible Star Wars Darth Vader action figure. Only Shawn and Gus, with Shawn dressed as James Bond in a tuxedo infiltrating the home of a British diplomat. Shawn recovers Darth, but also uncovers a murder. Meanwhile Lassiter is livid because Juliet did not tell him she was dating Shawn. Lassiter uses the lie detector on Juliet, Shawn and himself for different reasons, and the results are not always what everyone expected. This is a solid episode about communication and trust and fatal consequences.",1323216000,7,572,4.96875
4857290,5,B005PPMI00,"Where on TV can you find an episode about baseball that has Wade Boggs arguing with Corbin Benson (Major League movies) about baseball coaching, Michael Trucco (Battlestar Galatica) as a player and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) as the coach? Gus is hilarious as the mascot who does not take any gruff from fans or anyone else. Corbin Benson can still knock it out of the park, and Danny Glover reminds us ""I am too hold for this ....""  Another solid entry in the Psych series.",1323216000,,475,4.588235294117647
4857291,5,B005PPMI00,"I mean really. Shawn should be been committed years ago. But seeing Shawn help a billionaire (Brad Dourif in a terrific outing) who was being doused with meds and being wrongfully of murder was touching and sweet. Gus hitting on a woman with multiple personalities was a bit creepy. Otherwise, this was a solid Psych episode with plenty of red herrings thrown in.",1323216000,,363,4.777777777777778
4857292,5,B005PPMI00,"Psych usually matches up guest stars for family members seamlessly to the cast. This time, they seemed to have misfired. William Shatner plays Julia's dad, a con artist who was never around. (If this sounds familiar, see Stargate SG-1 Season 10 episode Family Ties when Vala's father Jacek comes to earth.)  Shatner showed very little emotion and seemed to have sleepwalked through the part.  The story was also a little too pat and predictable. There are a lot of great character actors who would have served this part with more emotional impact. Hopefully the Psych casting directors will turn to a veteran character actor next time instead of a well known name.",1323216000,3,664,4.919642857142857
4857293,5,B005PPMI00,"Lassiter is usually the butt of every joke in the episode, but in this one he actually enters a complex but serious romantic relationship that impacts his current case and his heart. While Lassiter still burns from his divorce, this episode showed he is finally ready to take a chance on love.",1322956800,,293,4.653846153846154
4857294,5,B005PPMI00,I have watched Psych since the beginning. My two favorite laugh out loud episodes were American Duo and Black and White (the fashion episode) until this Hangover spoof came along. This is by far the funniest episode to date. Woody the Medical Examiner is a hoot. Psych is clicking on all cylinders this season. The episodes just keep getting better and better.,1322956800,,360,4.82258064516129
4857295,5,B005PPMI00,"I've been watching Psych for a while now and it's one of my favorite shows on TV.  Lassiter is usually an obnoxious, ridiculous stick-in-the-mud but this episode plays up his character really well.  I am crazy about the new turn his character is taken and hope it stays this way.",1322697600,,279,4.56
4857296,5,B005PPMI00,These guys make me laugh.  All they have to do is look at each other and I laugh.  And the way they tease Lassie so much also makes me laugh.  I guess I really like this series because - it makes me laugh!,1322265600,,205,3.7209302325581395
4857297,5,B005PPMI00,"I discovered Psych about a year ago. I loyally watch all the episodes now, and they are great. This one was a little different, but I still liked it. Shawn and Gus are too funny sometimes, and I really like the sense of humor.

Of course, Amazon Instant Video for these shows is awesome and brings it to me with no connection issues.",1321660800,,333,4.285714285714286
4857298,5,B005PPMI00,"This is one of those series that is just fun--plain and simple. The premise doesn't change but the writing is just so engaging and hilarious that you can watch the same premise over and over and not feel cheated. The antics Gus and Shawn get into and the dialogue exchanges are HILARIOUS. There are SO many quotable lines. Plus, the supporting characters are just supreme. Lassie and the dad are adorable (however, the chief and juliet are a little two-dimensional for my taste).

I totally recommend this season (one of the best) and series to anyone who is looking for something to watch. It isn't earth shattering or ""stop the presses"" must see, but simply delightful and worth a watch.",1321315200,44,689,4.741666666666666

4857300,5,B005PPMI00,"Timothy Omundson does a very compelling job playing his character on Psych, but Lassiter has never been a favorite of mine.  I don't like to see him hurt, but I've never felt much of a connection to him.  I feel like we've only gotten snippets here and there that remind us that he's a human being and not a robot or a machine.  This episode changed all of that.  I'm hoping it's not because they are wrapping up the series (I am crossing my fingers for a 7th season!), but they are really going all out this season.  Without spoiling anything, I will just say that I'm generally a very cynical, non-touchy feely person (a less extreme version of Lassiter, basically), and even I was moved by the way the story played out.  It's a very Lassiter-focused episode but, surprisingly, it really, really works.  Omundson plays the heck out of his role and actually got my heart to break just a little.  This episode does a lot of things, but it definitely doesn't ""suck."" :)",1320796800,,968,4.491428571428571

4857302,2,B005PPMI00,"My rating is low on this season because I am so disappointed in the change in feel in the show.  This has been a great show to watch with my family up until now with the exception of a few episodes. I've only let my kids watch 2 out of the last three episodes and I haven't found it nearly as funny.  The producers have touched on agenda issues in the past, but now they are starting to push them.  I loved the emphasis on family and the importance of families staying together in some of the intial seasons.  Now we have Lasiter climbing all over a girl in bed and I am supposed to be excited about Shawn and Juliette possibly moving in together.  Forget viewing this as a family movie.  I hope this season doesn't continue this direction.",1320192000,11,740,4.25

What does makes the series bearable is his partner Gus.  One thing that puzzles me too...is how Everyone shows unending patience with Shawns stupidity and rudeness.  Sometimes Ive just wanted to grab the character and shake him!  If you watch the series in gulps (like I did) you will REALLY notice this flaw.",1520812800,,486,5.1923076923076925
