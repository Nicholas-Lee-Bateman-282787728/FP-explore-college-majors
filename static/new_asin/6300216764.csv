262110,4,6300216764,"Like the ""Airplane!"" films that succeeded it, ""The Big  Bus"" is hilarious parody of the oh-so-popular disaster flicks of the  1970's.  It is really like a disaster film as seen through the eyes of Tex  Avery, the master animator who threw everything into his 'toons, including  the kitchen sink at the expense of some poor soul.
""Bus""  features a superb cast of movie and television performers who mimic every  big name actor featured in bigger budgeted extravaganzas like ""The  Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and  ""Earthquake.""
In the words of Spike Lee, one must ""get  on this bus"" for a fun-filled ride.",968889600,13,620,4.990196078431373

I have searched many video catalouges and shelves trying to locate a  copy of the movie and thank Amazon for having it. A keeper for the Comedy  library, bent section.

I.'ve looked for it for decades and, now that I.'ve found it, it.s as funny now as it was then.  The scene near the beginning with the radioactive isotope had me in tears.  Someone suggested to me that the reason it didn't get much publicity and was hard to find is that Hollywood didn't want big budget disaster movies parodied.

To be certain, THE BIG BUS is not as consistently funny as AIRPLANE, but delivers enough light-hearted laughs to make it worth watching. I remember seeing it as a kid and loving it, so part of my fondness is probably pure nostalgia. There are a few lines that are so ridiculous ""One lousy foot..."" you'll be grinning for days and longer.

The comedy is sometimes obvious, and at times more sublet and silly. A great line-up of character actors, and a rather silly notion for a story (a nuclear-powered bus, with full amenities), make for a very entertaining - if slightly dated - farce fest of humor.

262401,5,6300216764,"In a classic case of bad timing, this wonderful sendup of 70s disaster films came out four years before ""Airplane,"" which means it got lost in the shuffle during the Bicentennial summer.  And the studio failed to promote it at all.  Superior to the later film on all counts, it boasts one thing that the Zuckers didn't have:  An actual vehicle on which most of the action takes place, which means the liberal humor doesn't depend on silliness.  That's a real 85-ton 32-wheel double decker bus (complete with swimming pool, bowling alley, and piano bar) zooming along the highway from New York to Denver.  Stockard Channing (why didn't she make more movies?) is perfect as the bus inventor's daughter/hostess.  The climax on a Rocky Mountain highway has to be seen to be believed.  Packed with notable B-listers of the time, it's an undiscovered gem that shouldn't be missed, even without bonus features explaining how a nuclear-powered bus works.

262404,5,6300216764,"In the late sixties and early seventies, Hollywood came out with ""Airport"", a plane crash movie with lots of sub plots involving passengers and air crew alike. These sub plots were usually things like marriges on the rocks, priests doubting their faith etc. etc. ad nauseum. This film did well at the box office so they made several sequels. They basically made the same movie over and over. After that petered out the thoght; what about other disasters? Then came ""The Hindenburgh"" The Towering Inferno""
""Earthquake"" The Poseidon Adventure"" etc. etc. ad nauseum.
 In 1976 The Big Bus was released. It was a brilliant satire of the formulaic crap Hoolyywood was churning out. The actors seemed to be having a good time making this film. It included almost every disaster  of the aforementioned disaster films and it also brilliantly satirized the subplots as well.  Afew years later, Hollywood comes out with ""airplane"" using the same style of humor as The Big Bus. Not only did they rip off the Big Bus but predictably made sequels.",1356912000,2,1033,4.8914285714285715
262451,4,6300216764,"An amazing homage to the Disaster Films on which I fed as a kid. They're all, to some extent, skewered here, from ""Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Earthquake"" with a layover at ""Towering Inferno"" on its way to lampooning the entire ""Airport"" franchise.

You have to love a movie that has Stockard Channing (doing, here, an incredible Stockard Channing impression -- a meta-reference to her own self-awareness of her trademark mannerisms as a character actress) delivering with sincerity a line such as ""We hope you enjoy your first stop on your non-stop trip from New York to Denver!"").

The primary conceit of the film is that the rich and famous and entitled (if only self-proclaimed) are taking a bus -- A BUS -- to Denver. No spoilers, though it's not exactly ""Citizen Kane"", but at the height of the dramatic goings on, you should never EVER stop to consider, ""why the heck don't they just pull over on the shoulder?""

Loved it. I've been looking for it for 30 years, and I found it and I loved it. Brain candy that nourishes the soul with laughter while rotting the grey matter.",1353283200,2,1076,4.682539682539683

And it was one of the first ""sight comedies"" I had seen. Much like with the ""Airport"" and ""Naked Gun"" movies, you need a certain sense of humor. But I enjoyed it so much that for all these years the title would come up whenever I was with the friends I had seen it with all those many years ago.

Its humor is mostly based upon the absurd; somewhat like that of Green Acres.  There is a host of possibilities in the basic premise of a large nuclear powered bus, and its colorful passengers.  The first time you watch it, it will have you wondering what will happen next.  If you have read the other reviews, you have a feel for the plot, so I won't go in to that again.  Should you buy it?  Well, if the price is right I would say yes.  It isn't the kind of movie that you will watch often, but it is the kind of movie that will make you happy it is in your collection, so that when you want to watch it again, it is there.",1265414400,2,755,3.895424836601307

I also agree it's better than Airplane.  It's my favorite spoof movie.
Has several gags including the drop down radiation suit.  Signs that you don't have it on right will be bleeding of the gums and hair falling out.

The father out on the parking lot because he can't be moved.  The one time he is taken inside he's on a slab of concrete and after he's done asks to be taken back to the parking lot.

A bar fight that involves a broken milk cartoon and broken candle stick.

The earthquake at the end was great!

Was glad that I could still get this DVD, it's used but in new condition.  Seems buying used is the only way to purchase this very funny movie.

262458,4,6300216764,"Shortly before the gross-out antics of ANIMAL HOUSE, and, of course, four years before AIRPLANE!, there was a film spoof of a different sort, namely THE BIG BUS.  It is similar to the later AIRPLANE! in that it makes as its target the disaster film craze that dominated the box office for much of the 1970s.  But the big difference is that the humor in THE BIG BUS is far less dominated by the zany sight gags and dead-pan facial expressions of AIRPLANE! and by a more sardonic brand of comedy, bordering closer to satire than spoof.  As such, while it might not be a non-stop yuk-fest like that later film was, THE BIG BUS still has many funny moments.  It just goes about it in some underhanded ways.

As has been said, this film involves the debut of a new kind of bus called Cyclops.  It runs on nuclear power...and, of course, it's a BIG BUS.  But when its two original drivers are killed in a sinister ""accident"" just prior to its maiden voyage, the daughter (Stockard Channing) of the bus's designer (Harold Gould) calls upon an old flame of hers (Joseph Bologna) to take on the job.  Bologna does this in order to redeem himself for a prior bus incident that involved, how shall we say, an unconventional method of survival.  Along with a fellow driver named Shoulders O'Brien (John Beck), because of his penchant of steering too close to the shoulder of the road, Cyclops goes on that voyage from New York to Denver, all the while still stalked by the same brother terrorist team (Jose Ferrer; Stuart Margolin) who want to turn it into a pile of atomic waste.

The film goes along at a very steady clip in its own carefree way, with an incredible cast of crazies, most notably (for me, anyway) Murphy Dunne as the deranged cocktail-lounge pianist who serenades a terminally ill man with ""Six Months To Live.""  There are more than a few sight-gags that elicit laughs, in particular the ""Flags Of All Nations"" bit; ""breaking wind"" at 90; and the soda-pop caper to fill the back of the bus and keep it from going off a cliff.  And when Cyclops is pulled out of its hangar, there is a reverential nod to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY via the use of the opening movement of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" in David Shire's score.

In general, however, THE BIG BUS is more underhanded in its comedic approach than most, in which the complete absurdity of the situation, the total lunacy of the characters involved, and the often broad performances of the actors (including Richard Mulligan, Sally Kellerman, Rene Auberjonois, Ned Beatty, Lynn Redgrave, and others), rather than sight-gags or gross-out insanity, invite the laughs.  As such, audiences probably couldn't have appreciated this film as much as they did AIRPLANE! later on.  But this hardly makes THE BIG BUS a disappointment, far from it.  It just goes about getting its laughs differently.",1241308800,,2901,4.714851485148515

262522,4,6300216764,"Before there was `Airplane!', there was... The Big Bus.

In fact, it was three years before Airplane, that this prototype disaster movie spoof appeared, directed by James Frawley who also directed `The Muppet Movie'. Although similar in tone, the humour is less one liner and more atmosphere driven - and on the whole works. OK, it's a bit hit and miss, and it's clear why `Airplane!' is so much better known -but this movie definitely does not deserve to be forgotten.

First there's that high concept idea - a nuclear powered bus on its maiden transcontinental journey, beset by sabotage and a driver who has a reputation as partial cannibal and a co-driver prone to blackouts (""it's ok, it's only when on the move"").

Then there's the characters - Father Kudos (Rene Auberjonois, LONG before his Star Trek Deep Space 9 days) who is having an Exorcist-like faith crisis, the couple who are celebrating their divorce, the man with 6 months to live who argues in the lounge with the failed vet over who understands bitterness the most... and of course, that ever cheerful lounge piano player who smiles and sings at whatever comes his way. Robert Bologna and Stockard Channing headline, in extremely similar roles to the pilot and stewardess from Airplane!. Even smaller roles are filled by well known names - Ned Beatty, Jose Ferrer (the man in the iron lung, masterminding the demise of the bus at the behest of the oil industry..).

And one cannot forget, that wonderful bus! The size.. the bad 70's taste dcor.. the gadgets! One moment encapsulates the humour the movie is aiming at - with the bus building speed and the brakes failing, the driver suddenly has a brainwave.. the flags of all nations! A button is pressed, and up come the fluttering flags from the roof, helping slow the bus down. Or the bar fight spoofing West Side story when someone shouts `Look out! He's got a broken milk carton!' as the man (John Beck, as `Shoulders' O'Brien) says `I hate to see a man down when he's kicked'.

The wonderful thing about the humour is that it parodies a genre without concentrating too much on parodies of specific movies, the modern day spoofs so often do.

In short, it isn't subtle, it's certainly over the top, it's as hammy as the lead actors name suggests, but if you have a funny bone, this should tickle it.",1172361600,,2324,4.697788697788698

The big bus is a nuclear-powered monster of a thing, complete with bowling alley, swimming pool, and piano bar. It can change tires automatically, while still moving! It can wash itself! It can go 90mph around curves, with only minor internal chaos! The passenger list is a screwball dream-come-true! Ruth Gordon is the dirty old lady, quick on the draw with her perfectly rude remarks! Rene Auberjonois is the conflicted / doubting priest, who has a nasty streak as long as the bus! Lynn Redgrave is the celebrity on board, seducing any man she encounters. She's also got a secret score to settle! Sally Kellerman and Richard Mulligan are the battling couple, set to finalize their divorce, but unable to keep their hands off each other! Of course, let's not forget the washed-up veterinarian, the terminal guy with six months to live (which Lynn Redgrave helps him to overcome), and the narcoleptic co-driver who passes out at the wheel every few minutes! Did I mention Larry Hagman as the doctor who spends most of the movie in a parking lot, because his patient (Harold Gould) ""can't be moved""? Or Ned Beatty and Howard Hesseman as technicians who must work together, but just don't get along? Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there's a bomb on board!

What no reviewer has mentioned is that the movie is gorgeous to watch...beautifully designed and shot. Airplane, although perhaps the more consistently funny movie, seems to have tried to copy the production of The Big Bus, but it comes off as looking sadly cheap and bland. They did learn the lesson, though, that you never stop the jokes coming. The Big Bus loses one star for letting up here and there to attempt moments of drama that don't quite work.

Dinner at the captain's table, the piano bar singer, engine trouble, estranged lovers rekindling a failed romance, hidden secrets, medical emergencies....all during a fateful cross-country trip on the world's first nuclear-powered bus on its maiden voyage. Joe Bologna (also seen in ""My Favorite Year"") and Stockard Channing headline a cast of '70s icons and Love Boat/Fantasy Island regulars. You just can't beat the drama of a life-threatening situation on an out-of-control BUS!

Murphy Dunne - the pianist in ""The Blues Brothers"" is out and out hilarious. (Check out the ""Six Months To Live"" song.) Other great moments include Sally Kellerman balling over the fact her ""estranged"" husband gets shot - then Richard Mulligan pops his head up and goes ""Heh heh heh heh-heeeh ha!!"", Shoulders, the co-driver who keeps to the shoulders, and the attempt to ""break wind"" that's aborted. ""Back to Fifty Five! Cop behind us!""  But the best is a conversation between two passengers. An angry vetrinarian asks the man with 6 months to live what he hates.

How could it have gone right when your nominal stars are Joseph Bologna, Stockard Channing, and John ""the Chin"" Beck?  Seeing it again it doesn't seem as funny but it is good for some scattershot hoots.  Kind of anticipated ""Airplane"" with a few less laughs.
