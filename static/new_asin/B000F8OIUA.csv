2555081,2,B000F8OIUA,"I'm a Mark Lewis fan, which is why I ordered this movie in the first place. There are definitely highlights and the movie is entertaining but did not live up to expectations set by The Natural History of the Chicken.",1200873600,,216,4.425
2555082,4,B000F8OIUA,"An interesting video if you are a cat lover and enjoy cat shows. It follow several breeders and see how they prepare for one of the biggest show, also a comprehensive coverage of the show. And although I am thousands of miles away in Hong Kong, I see familiar face of the judges!  But it is a documentary, not a ""how-to"" video that teach you how to groom your cat and prepare for the show nor tell you what is ""The standard of Perfection"". Make sure it is what you want.",1191369600,3,470,4.164835164835165
2555083,5,B000F8OIUA,This movie is funnier than Best in Show or anything that SNL could do. It is absolutely fascinating and hysterical at the same time. It is a true classic and I recommend it to anyone who loves mockumentaries or to anyone who knows a crazy cat lady or to anyone who is a crazy cat person.  A definite five stars.,1187136000,4,311,4.183333333333334
2555084,5,B000F8OIUA,"I was happy to find this title because I was at the Intl Cat Show in Houston when they taped it so I saw many familiar faces. I love it! Shows many spectacular cats!

8119091,3,B000F8OIUA,"It is in sort of a sound bite form as we bounce back and forth between best in show and best in show wannabes.

Even though this documentary is designed for people interested in feline competition it holds some insight as to what our furry companions are really all about. We get lots of fascinating pictures of kitties being prepared for the show and Kitty owners being prepared for the kitties.

If you look closely you will probably see a few of your own in there.

Most people are intrigued from the front to the back of this film. However if you start to find the owners annoying do not give up and be sure to watch the surprise ending.",1405036800,,641,4.325
8119092,5,B000F8OIUA,"I make documentaries for a living and this is my all time favorite documentary. If you love cats and have a sense of humor, this documentary will charm you endlessly. I've watched it about 10 times in the past year. Yes, it really is that good! You will laugh and cry and appreciate your cat all that much more. Recommended as a gift for cat lovers and for people who have a new pet cat or are considering breeding or showing cats as a hobby. A delightful cast of characters.",1390953600,,475,4.288888888888889
8119093,5,B000F8OIUA,"Show Cattle is very entertaining and informative at the same time.  Full of humor for all ages.  The production of this film is excellent and you will
want to rerun it time after time.",1322179200,,184,4.382352941176471
8119094,5,B000F8OIUA,I showed Burmese for 10 years till a medical condition stopped my going out. I missed the cat shows very much and came across this DVD. It was wonderful. It brought back so many memories of good things. Is balanced and well worth while viewing.,1301097600,,244,4.444444444444445
8119095,5,B000F8OIUA,"This documentary provided great insight into cow beauty: I had no idea that the best in breed, just like purebred dogs, were so much the work of humans.

The human owners are using hair spray, fur dye, hair clippers, and glue to make the show cows beautiful.  The farmers explain what the standards are: lots of veins in the udders are good, teats should line up a certain way, the tuft at the end of the tail should be fluffy.  Hooves are even being ground down with an angle grinder and pedicured.  Even that ridge of fur at the spine is exaggerated by shaving the rest of the fur off.

Beauty is not only in the eye of the human beholder, but the human has such a hand in enhancing and improving the cow's natural beauty.",1296086400,,724,4.294117647058823
8119096,5,B000F8OIUA,"Another Mark Lewis film looking at the relationships that people have with their animals.  This time it's show cats.  This is a fun, excellent video for anyone interested in what the world of show cats is all about.  Lewis follows four or five owners through the process of acquiring, showing, breeding, and caring for their show cats.  We are introduced to several different breeds of cats and we see the show in progress.  The film is fun and well put together.",1259020800,,463,4.666666666666667
8119097,4,B000F8OIUA,"Mark Lewis has done it again.  This is a very interesting look into the world of show cattle and the people who are devoted to their cows.  This film is only about an hour long, but we get a sense of the intense competition and excitement around a show.  Owners talk about who might win and who doesn't look so good this year.  There are funny moments when people get really serious about their cows.  Definitely fun to watch.",1259020800,,426,4.341772151898734
8119098,4,B000F8OIUA,"This comical Mark Lewis movie goes behind the scenes of the Houston International cat show (one of the largest cat shows in the world). This is kind of a mockumentary that interviews the very competitive owners of the competing cats. Whoever said that owners look like their dogs, should meet these folks interviewed who look just like their cats! This is like a true ""Best in Show"" for the cat set. It's a great show, I laughed, I cried and had just a good feeling after watching this. If you are familiar with and like Mark Lewis' other mockumentaries you'd like this one.",1239235200,,574,4.58252427184466
8119099,5,B000F8OIUA,"""The ""Standard of Perfection"" has become the guideline by which animal show judges award points and prizes to worthy animals. With wit and respect, director Mark Lewis (The Natural History of the Chicken) takes viewers behind the scenes at the International Cat Show in Houston, Texas to expose the intense preparation to prime an animal for the biggest show of the year. "" - PBS",1215907200,,379,4.846153846153846
8119100,5,B000F8OIUA,"When I saw Mark Lewis' last comical & honest documentary about Chickens, I KNEW I had to order this one as well. Mark Lewis follows a group of New England farmers and their cherished show cattle through the whole process of a major cattle show. He shows how they spoil, prepare, and endure the competition for the coveted ""Grand Champion"". As only Mark Lewis can, it is a heartfelt, comical and genuine show. I laughed and I cried!

I grew up showing cattle in 4-H and it's a little known very competitive sport. Lots of premium money, pride and rosettes are up for the taking in cattle shows. It takes lots of hard work and lots of building a trusting relationship with the cattle. It's much like a marriage of sorts! Mark Lewis covers this in a very humorous, but truthful and touching way. It's about humans and about their relationships with their cattle.

If you have grown up around cattle at all, you know they each have their own personalities (just like people) and Mark Lewis shows the very humorous side of this. He also covers the evil lengths that some people who show cattle will go to hurt an animal they think will win over their animals. Being on the receiving end of this when I showed, I enjoyed this segment. To many people who show it's like someone hurting your child! If you didn't already know, you will learn that showing beef or dairy cattle is a sport like any other. And that like some women in the beauty pagent circuit are borne into it, some cattle are born for the show!

If you are a Mark Lewis fan this one won't disappoint you! Also if you have a child in 4-H or if you are just curious about showing cattle, I'd suggest picking this up. It's very family friendly and for all ages.",1207094400,,1716,4.406940063091483
