6255461,5,B00IA7MFEO,"I'm sure I will 'love it'.  I love Darryl Stephens.

But I do not love all the mistakes Amazon.com has been making lately in their product details.

They show ""Number of Discs: 2""

The cover clearly reads ""3 disc set""

I guess you just can't hire good help these days and provide them with vision insurance.",1406160000,8,307,4.410714285714286

6255463,5,B00IA7MFEO,"I just received my copy of dtla yesterday's and I loved it, well worth the money I spent! I loved Jeremy Jackson in Baywatch so was thrilled when I found out he was in this tv series, I had read in a review on here that his full frontal scenes were deleted from the series but , I am happy to say that review was wrong and that it is indeed in the tv series, the acting is good And all of the cast Are great looking, just A very good show I am sure I will watch over and over again.",1401753600,43,482,3.735294117647059
6255464,5,B00IA7MFEO,"I first heard of this project from a picture of Daryl Stephens and Danny Roberts kissing in a scene from an unnamed project. It looked sexy and I couldn't wait to see it. I never read about the project again. Then one day I saw on Amazon under the ""those who bought this bought these items"" section I saw the DTLA dvd so I clicked on it and I saw Darryl Stephens listed as an actor. Then I check on IMDB and saw that Danny Roberts was in the project. BINGO. Read about it being a gay series that I didn't know was on tv but it sounded sort of interesting. So I bought the DVD. Thank heavens I did. What a great show that should get another season. I think what makes me like it is that the two main characters in the first episode are at a totally different place when they end the season. And it is not what you expect. With name guest stars and sexy naked men, it is something I can watch over and over again.",1400198400,97,911,4.010989010989011

6255466,1,B00IA7MFEO,Series started out promising but the last couple of episodes felt like they lost funding on the show and just decided to end it.  Was very disappointed in the last couple episodes.,1482710400,2,180,4.625

6255474,5,B00IA7MFEO,"Finally, after years without Noah's Arc we are gifted with another gay male themed series. DTLA delivers all the juicy goodness of what you'd expect a gay male series to be. Let's face it, there is a full on desert on TV and cable for shows like these, and DTLA is a cool drink of water in that desert. And...to add a cherry to the top of this creamy cool treat is none other than ""I Love New York"" herself Tiffany Pollard. NY not only guess stars in the show but does a little after show interview for every episode which IS included on this DVD. Is this a perfect series? No. Some low budget issues, and a some what slow pilot episode. Not to mention a slight typo on the back of the box. But all in all, this was a great and enjoyable series, and a must have for any fan of the genre.",1469318400,11,787,4.051282051282051

6255479,3,B00IA7MFEO,"Although it is a Drama, there is frankly too much drama! For me the story went no-where. The one couple who seemed solid in the end were splitting up. Does no one in a gay themed show stay together? It is not very true to life or is it for big city people?  If there were another season it would need to clean up the drama and get peoples lives in order and move on.",1462492800,8,366,3.88

6255483,5,B00IA7MFEO,"Not sure why so many reviewers here are trashing this show. I understood what it was trying to do and I'm kinda please I bumped into DTLA at the video store. I haven't heard of it and don't like watching series, but this one got me addicted and that's a good thing. Kudos to the actors for really giving it their all. I actually teared up during the the 3rd episode when the main couple had decided to break up. I felt their pain and vulnerability under the pressure cooker of circumstances. It's not perfect, but DTLA set out to do what it wanted to do and it does it successfully. I for one was glued one disc after another and could not wait to see what was going to happen to the characters next. Totally recommend! Also, it was awesome to see Luenell and William McNamara two great actors in my book!",1440979200,5,805,4.26797385620915
6255484,5,B00IA7MFEO,"Another series predicated on gay clubs and the people who go to them Not quite as graphic as ""queer folks"", but just as compelling. Disappointing that there weren't more episodes, but definitely worth the investment Check it out!",1438387200,3,229,5.052631578947368
6255485,5,B00IA7MFEO,"I absolutely love the series, so sorry that it was not continued. It was well worth watching every single episode. Hopefully Mr. Stephens will pick it back up.",1438041600,6,159,4.714285714285714

6255491,1,B00IA7MFEO,"I bought this thinking it might be a little like QAF or ""Looking"" but its not.  The acting is HORRIBLE in this series!  I didn't even watch all of the episodes - I couldn't stomach it.  Its kind of like watching a bad high school play on film - no story line, fake acting and cringe-worthy writing...don't waste your money on this.",1430697600,4,331,4.306451612903226
6255492,2,B00IA7MFEO,"Typical gay show that lacks substance, any acting talent and tries to compensate with lots of skin.  If this is a portrait of life in gay LA I'll pass.  Pathetic.",1427500800,2,162,4.366666666666666

6255494,1,B00IA7MFEO,So shallow.  Definitely a soap feel.  I had absolutely no feeling for any of the characters.  I watched the whole series online because one reviewer said it took some time to develop.  It did not.,1425513600,,196,4.514285714285714

6255509,3,B00IA7MFEO,"This is a TV series that is basically a primetime soap centering on gay men.  Not many of the characters are that interesting or attractive.  I found it difficult to see the two main characters as a couple.  Most all of the gay stereotypes are here along with some of the modern gay attitudes about being serious, totally accepted by all and belonging.  I don't have access to the channel that runs the series, and this DVD did not make me regret that at all.",1414713600,4,459,4.364705882352941

6255513,1,B00IA7MFEO,"I was dissapointed with this series in a big way. Darryl Stephens has done lots of wonderful work in pretty much everything he attempts and would like to see him go mainstream and branch out into different characters. This series however was not anyone's best work. Very poor acting, comic book, actually,it was difficult to care about any on the characters or their lives, the editing needed a great deal of work as it was difficult to follow from one scene to another oftentimes, and it was so overacted, that it was laughable. Especially when the viewer could see that they were taking all this so seriously.  A much better choice for a life in gay LA would be The Broken Hearts Club. You care about the actors and their lives, LA is put in a good light, and the people seemed genuine.  The acting was good and the resolution of the story was good as well.  I would suggest the buyer not waste their time with DTLA and check out lots of other independant films with far better stories and acting.",1409443200,11,999,4.478021978021978
6255514,3,B00IA7MFEO,"Started off well but by the final episode it was starting to look more like they were writing the script as they were filming.
Good try tho. Hope more LGBT series are given a chance",1409356800,3,181,4.2
6255515,5,B00IA7MFEO,"As a former resident of Los Angeles and its surrounding communities, I found myself connecting with many of the characters and social situations in this series.  Los Angeles is a place where one must fight against the norm in order to have a seemingly normal life.  Otherwise, you could be subject to having frivolous relationships with shallow people who care more about hookups, lattes, and tans than they do the development of truly meaningful relationships...",1409097600,18,463,5.16
6255516,1,B00IA7MFEO,"Don't be seduced by the cover art. This is an atrociously written Nickel-and-Dime version of QUEER AS FOLK. A series that has absolutely nothing to say...and says it, replying on extended kissing and shower scenes instead of either plot or dialogue.",1408406400,10,249,5.097560975609756
6255517,3,B00IA7MFEO,"except for Darryl Stephens who could read the phone book in the shower, thought the characters were forgettable. Even Sandra Bernhard and Melanie Griffith seemed to be playing some versions of themselves. That said, it did have a plot and unforgettable lines from Lennie's father, Paul Mooney, who once tried to evict me from a def comedy jam. It does seem odd the last disc has more episodes on it than the first two but once you know that, easy not to miss the ending. I liked the idea but in terms of execution, this is a lot of hurry up and wait.",1408406400,4,550,4.349514563106796

8640309,2,B00IA7MFEO,"I guess this series tries to be an LA version of ""Queer as Folk"". it suffers from less-than-great writing. The actors are OK, but one has the feeling that they would have performed better in the hands of a different director.",1505779200,,225,4.512195121951219
