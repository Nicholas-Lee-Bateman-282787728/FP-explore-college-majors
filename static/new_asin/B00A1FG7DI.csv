I guarantee that your employees will laugh, so at least it makes for good entertainment.

The message is accurate, but the video is so old that it's funny, and I saved over $500.

Your call on how ""cool"" you want to be with that training.",1412899200,,449,4.01123595505618
8546075,3,B00A1FG7DI,"So many of these dvds are almost $1000, so when I found this one for a reasonable price, I decided to try it. First of all, even though it is copyrighted 2008, it looks like it was filmed a while ago -- I will guess the 80s. There are references to Anita Hill as if that just happened, and the clothing/hair styles are outdated. Having said that, the message really has not changed since this was recorded. so if you are looking for some vignettes to help your HR training, this will suffice. It is a little corny, but gets the point across. It also has written materials.",1390262400,,572,4.305555555555555
