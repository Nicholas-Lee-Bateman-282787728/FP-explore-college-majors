2849389,5,B000QXDEGS,"Next to the Wonder Years, this was my favorite tv series.  I wish there had been many more episodes as I truly missed it when it went off the air.  A great cast, beautiful scenery, wonderful story line, unforgettable characters you will come to love.  Has a little bit of everything in the stories of these people.  I loved it !!",1197849600,10,329,4.344262295081967
2849390,5,B000QXDEGS,"This is a heart warming series. The acting and variety of characters is wonderful. The filming will make you want to visit Ireland. This series will make you laugh, cry and at times sit at the edge of your seat. Deals with real life in a humorous yet tender way with plenty of comedy for relief. Had two of the main actors not passed away and Colin Farrow not left, this might still be running? American TV could learn alot from this production. This is one to watch over and over.",1195257600,36,481,4.2967032967032965
2849391,4,B000QXDEGS,"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity.  As the series begins we come to know an attractive pub owner who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born.  In time she begins to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentative portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion.  Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guinness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theoretical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality).  If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's public radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (Saturdays at 6 pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"".

This show though, like a brain, has two lobes of sorts, with the dividing line between the first 3 seasons  (26 episodes) and the 2 seasons following them (24 episodes); with season 6 (an abbreviated season of 8 episodes) pretty much standing alone.  (And whether you will enjoy season six comes down to the sort of person you are; whether you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers. The answer to that will determine whether you easily accept the loss of 3 huge cast members---one of whom passed away in real life necessitating major changes---with 3 other supporting players moving on as well---that series six  tries to recover from, and thus is not especially representative of the proceeding years of this still welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, just not the same anymore absent the fulcrum (raison d'tre even) of the whole program.)

Season four, in this sense, is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts to digest huge cast changes. Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year. Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explanation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear;  a bear, who obviously then wreaks a bit of havoc. New faces are also introduced. The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town). In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse. 3 of these, incidentally, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the program's 2 central characters. Father Aidan, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot and his sister provides much needed liveliness.  Change in series 5 is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who interestingly too, was Father Aidan actor Don Wycherley's real-life sister-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program & who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring)  is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.

After having viewed this series several times I am almost tempted to suggest newcomers to the series to start with season 4 and then ""flashback,"" in effect, to the first 3 seasons so as to end with the most dramatic episodes of the entire series (which are the last 2 of season 3).

P.S.  In case you're in the Dublin area one day, do take the time to visit the ""set"" of Ballykissangel, which isn't one at all actually; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming. It's not that far from Dublin, where you can have a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar ; and/or visit BallyK's church,  as you walk into ""the program,"" so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar.  (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing Assumpta's Leo in the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".)  Cheers",1183161600,148,6397,4.6812110418521815

The children in particular were obnoxious and the ""plots"" were confusing.  Pub owning pries was a poor substitute for the Father  Peter Clifford.

2849497,3,B000QXDEGS,"I agree with another reviewer in that the first three series are great and the last few series weren't great so I settled on three stars. Maybe three and a half. Too many new characters introduced too quickly changed the whole complexion of the show and the direction of the show. It seemed to get darker with a lot of plotting and scheming, etc. In a word, it became soapy. I liked neither the direction or the new characters. I believe it was Edward Abbey who wrote, ""change is inevitable but progress is not"". It wasn't written about this program but it could have been.",1455667200,,573,4.466666666666667
2849498,4,B000QXDEGS,The last 3 seasons of Ballykissangel are okay but the first 3 seasons are wonderful.  This is a drama and a comedy with many twists and turns in the plot,1454803200,,153,4.1

2849523,5,B000QXDEGS,"Bally K is a wonderful series. Its a light hearted series with delightful characters beautiful scenery a great story line throughout the entire 6 years. Each episode will keep your interest and even the money hungry Quigley eventually shows his soft side. Their is comedy, drama and serious times within the series, The characters will become your best friends and yes their are several moments that are both surprising and will make you cry. Its like you are living in Ballykissangel in each and every episode and you will want see what happens next from episode to episode. Both new and old characters come and go but the new characters fit in very well. The quality of this series is EXCELLENT, clean, wholesome and entertaining. I recommend it highly and a joy to watch over and over. Two other BBC series I would also HIGHLY RECOMMEND  are Doc Martin and a BBC series filmed in Scotland MONARCH'S of the Glen. Both these series are clean, wholesome well written Series with drama and comedy and like Bally K you will fall in love with the stories and characters.",1441065600,4,1067,4.705882352941177

2849527,5,B000QXDEGS,"Of all the BBC productions, Ballykissangel is probably my favorite. I have worked my way through the series at least 3 times already, and I expect I will watch it many more times to come. There are a lot of cast and character changes along the way, and a couple of shockers that you don't see coming, but I never get tired of watching this.",1435276800,,340,4.246153846153846
2849528,5,B000QXDEGS,"We are about half way through the set, and my wife and I could not be more pleased. We actually look forward to each new episode. It is full of the simple conditions of life, and the problems we all face. It has humor, Irish centered charm, quirky characters, and a refreshing absence of vulgarity, profanity, reference to body functions, and nudity. One actually cares about the characters, and the little interactions between them make for a very enjoyable hour or so of TV.  The fact that there are no commercials seals the deal. If you like shows like Doc Martin and Lark Rise to Candleford, you will like this.",1435017600,5,615,4.590909090909091

2849559,3,B000QXDEGS,I am very disappointed with the volume problems on all the CD's. Either they are to loud or so low you cannot understand what is being said. Its very sad that BBC took away all our resources to watch these shows and forced us to purchase substandard CD's.,1425945600,,255,4.333333333333333

The characters are extremely well developed, and most of the episode plots are well thought out.  I just bought the collection for a friend, and he is constantly thanking me and telling me how much he enjoys it.  The only sad part of this is that the series was not continued.  Bravo to the writers and the cast!",1423094400,,411,4.44

2849596,3,B000QXDEGS,I really loved this show when it was first being shown on pbs several years ago. It definitely shows it's age some now in this box set. The picture quality seems faded now that we're all used to digital and the broad Irish brogues could really benefit from some onscreen captions. The storylines and characters hold up well.  Just wish a little more effort had gone into the production of these DVDs.,1417910400,,400,4.555555555555555
2849597,4,B000QXDEGS,"We are enjoying the BallyKissangel collection. So far it's a fairly lighthearted depiction of small Irish town complete with conflicts between local interests, some interesting stereotypes and overall just a nice viewing experience. We find it completely entertaining, and I appreciate the lack of violence, no foul language, etc. It has a lot of humor without the suffocating stupidity of current USA sit-com TV shows. I'd say it's family friendly, and if you get it when it's on sale it's a very good viewing value for the dollars spent. If you need some sort of comparison, it's sort of along the lines of the Andy Griffith shows (for those of you old enough to remember it)  but not quite as quirky as Northern Exposure :)",1417910400,3,726,4.808

The storyline was very well thought out as well as the characters.  The synopsis of this program is given on the purchase page so I won't rehash it.

2849662,4,B000QXDEGS,"I fell in love with this series when I saw it on Public Television years ago.  Of course I did not see all the episodes and resolved to get the series when it came out on DVD.  It did, I did, and I am not in the process of watching the last season (of 6) having seen the previous seasons in order on DVD.  I must say the DVDs only confirmed my affection.  BUT, a big but I am afraid, the first three season cannot be equaled for charming Irish light comedy and truly likable people.  The next two seasons, with some significant cast changes, is not quite the equal of the first three, and the last season (and perhaps the reason it is the last) is really nothing to watch at all.  The economics of life dictate that you buy all 6, but, unless you are a nut for completing things, skip the 6th season and pretend that there were only 5 (and relish the memory of those 5).",1405900800,,870,4.088235294117647

I don't usually review a product before finishing it but I am hoping this review will prompt changes in the DVD package.
First, I wish that Close Caption or English Subtitles was included. Far more than once I  had to pause and rewind to catch what the character was saying. Note: I am 2nd generation Irish-American and I have been around Irish relatives and friends all my life-------both culchies and jackeens----------and I still had trouble understanding.
Second, I wish the bonus material was offered on the latter seasons instead of the first season. After completing Season One, I watched the cast interviews and behind the scenes material and learned what was coming in future seasons.

2850010,4,B000QXDEGS,"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. As the series begins we come to know an attractive pub owner who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born. In time she begins to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentative portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guinness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theoretical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's public radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (Saturdays at 6 pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"".

This show though, like a brain, has two lobes of sorts, with the dividing line between the first 3 seasons (26 episodes) and the 2 seasons following them (24 episodes); with season 6 (an abbreviated season of 8 episodes) pretty much standing alone. (And whether you will enjoy season six comes down to the sort of person you are; whether you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers. The answer to that will determine whether you easily accept the loss of 3 huge cast members---one of whom passed away in real life necessitating major changes---with 3 other supporting players moving on as well---that series six tries to recover from, and thus is not especially representative of the proceeding years of this still welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, just not the same anymore absent the fulcrum (raison d'tre even) of the whole program.)

Season four, in this sense, is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts to digest huge cast changes. Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year. Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explanation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear; a bear, who obviously then wreaks a bit of havoc. New faces are also introduced. The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town). In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse. 3 of these, incidentally, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the program's 2 central characters. Father Aidan, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot and his sister provides much needed liveliness. Change in series 5 is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who interestingly too, was Father Aidan actor Don Wycherley's real-life sister-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program & who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring) is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.

After having viewed this series several times I am almost tempted to suggest newcomers to the series to start with season 4 and then ""flashback,"" in effect, to the first 3 seasons so as to end with the most dramatic episodes of the entire series (which are the last 2 of season 3).

P.S. In case you're in the Dublin area one day, do take the time to visit the ""set"" of Ballykissangel, which isn't one at all actually; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming. It's not that far from Dublin, where you can have a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar ; and/or visit BallyK's church, as you walk into ""the program,"" so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing Assumpta's Leo in the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".) Cheers",1308182400,14,6383,4.6812110418521815
2850011,4,B000QXDEGS,"The single thing I wanted to point out here is that in the all-important third season, wherein the lead characters, Father Peter and his lady love Assumpta, leave the show, there is an episode gone AWOL.  Episode 9, ""The Waiting Game,"" is inexplicably missing.  As far as I know it is not available on any release anywhere.  This probably shouldn't stop you from buying it, but it certainly is strange.",1301702400,56,402,4.714285714285714

The series goes along with relatively the same cast of actors who bring to the series a warmth and friendship and obvious talent to relate to each other. You almost feel like you're right there in the story. It gave you a good feeling. However, after series four the cast went through a lot of changes as did the story lines. Although, it lost much of what it had in the first four series, it still provided the warmth and wholesomeness that you don't see these days on American television. My wife and I viewed the entire series before we decided to purchase the complete set and we're glad we made the purchase decision. Now we can look at it over and over whenever we feel like going back to Ireland and enjoying the friendships again.

If you like a feel good series, Ballykissangel is just what you are looking for. There are solid performances in each episodes and a non sequential story. Each story is complete and not a continuation of the previous episode. Enjoy!",1298764800,78,1302,4.583690987124464

I fell in love with in on PBS TV and am enjoying owning it.  I can watch it over and over and still love it -- AND IT IS CLEAN AND VIOLENCE FREE -- just a good story of the people in a village in Ireland.  I feel like a part of the village.  THANK YOU BBC, PBS, and thanks, Amazon, for helping me get my own copy of it.",1296345600,41,457,3.768421052631579
2850014,5,B000QXDEGS,We ordered a used like new and when we received it we noticed that it had never even been out of it's packaging. The Series of Bally K is dynamite especially after having visited Ireland. We did go to Avoca where this was filmed and it is all so real as in the film of it. The folks there are very easy and accommodating to the Americans.  $$$$??  May have something to do with it.  The Bally Kissangel is a fun show to watch in about 45 minutes segments.  Am glad that I finally bought it.,1290988800,,490,4.072916666666667
2850065,3,B000QXDEGS,"A good series about a small village in Ireland,the series change characters. It should have ended before the last 2 years",1288310400,4,121,4.809523809523809

2850067,5,B000QXDEGS,"I feel that the writers, directors and actors do an exceptional job of presenting vignettes of life and human behavior while satisfying the appetite of the Irish diaspora for more knowledge of the old country. Sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, mostly sweet and entertaining: small-town twentieth-century life is shown with some universal and some uniquely Irish attributes. We think we're being shown a by-gone life but out come the cell phones and computers.

The New World English-speaking ear must listen carefully to understand Irish ""craic"" (what we'd call wise-cracking) delivered in authentic speech. The writers seem to stop just short of stereotypical images but one can see stereotyping in bitchy or meddling women and indolent or conniving men. But the writers have it all come out OK in the end, and the nastiness turns into warmth. The jailbird turns into a loving father. The quintessential mother-in-law advises the unhappy widowed Niamh to renew a love relationship with her son's competition.

Only in the sixth season does the writing and/or directing seem infected by an influence, possibly of someone who thinks the series needs to pick up pace. I think that was a mistake and can see that mistake in judgment might have been the death knell for the series. For example, I could have done without the on-screen spitting of one of the latter characters. It seems to be there just for shock value. And the way the scenes cut from one to another becomes unnecessarily jarring. Personally, I didn't like that kind of updating. But that's minor compared to overall value; definitely a five-star series IMHO.",1282176000,4,1623,5.097744360902255
2850068,5,B000QXDEGS,"The serries is beautifully produced, written and performed with a cast that seems real.  Its portrayal of small-town Irish life is sympathetic but with warts and all, and the underlying theme of the changing Irish attitude toward the Catholic Church is well done. The woman roles are strong and attractive.  What more do you want?",1265846400,2,330,4.9818181818181815

2850073,5,B000QXDEGS,"I NEVER watch drama or ""dramedies"" on TV, and I stumbled into this one by accident. I was looking for funny BBC shows on Netflix on Demand service. Having been through my favorite BBC series start-to-finish, ""Keeping Up Appearances,"" I was looking for something on par with that. Ballykissanel turned out to be as good but nothing like that other BBC classic. I'd been through the best of them so I put in Season One and Two of this Ballykissangel show. I watched the first show, then the second and before long, I couldn't stop. I was expecting something in the way of a comedy, and I am NOT a soap opera person by any stretch. This series, well, the first three seasons, is so well-written, so well-cast, so well-flimed/directed/produced that I found myself compulsively watching each episode, one after another. I soon had to get the other seasons on the Netflix on Demand service, finally having to get the fifth season DVD sent to me because I had to follow it through to the end. All that said, they could well have ended this series after Season Three and it would have been a masterpiece. The last three episodes in Season Three are so well done, that this big guy had to muster the ability not to well-up lest he be deservedly teased unmercifully by the wife he often teases for crying at movies. The first parts of Season Four are OK, but it frankly digressed from there into a soap opera centered mostly around Niamh Quigley/Eagen/Dillon, and the writing got super soapy, and the production wasn't as good, the filming was looking for video-ish than film-like. The addition of young ""Col"" Farrell did nothing for me, and I could begin to second guess the plots as the shows went on from there, whereas the first three seasons kept me guessing. Yeah, I know there are fans of the ""mid seasons"" and even the final one who will hate what I'm saying, but I'm firmly in the ""First three seasons were amazing and best"" camp. The later additions of the Dooleys as pub owners didn't  help in my opinion, the whole weird uncle thing was a big contrived, but still because the first three seasons were so dang good, it almost wasn't fair to try to hold the others up to compare to them. Bottom line though, this series as a whole is smashing. It sucked a manly-man into a dramedy series, a near-soap-opera experience that has never grabbed my undying attention before with any other TV series, and probably never will again. If left me visiting Ireland travel sites, finding out how much it would cost to visit, knowing I'll be sorely disappointed if I am looking for Ballykissangel in Avoca, but still wanting to go and planning now to do so. So go I will at some point. And while I won't find these characters in the locals, just like you won't find Norm at Cheers in Boston, I will get to see the street it was filmed on, visit the lovely countryside where it was situated, and enjoy a lovely vacation. Now, that all said, if you don't think you like this kind of thing, I say watch the first three or four shows in Season One and see if it doesn't suck you in with its writing, location, production, cast and quality. It sure got me. If you're unsure about it, get the disk or Instant Viewing on Netflix. Me, I'm getting the Complete Collection on DVD. Aside from Star Trek and Monty Python, its the only other TV show complete collection I've ever wanted to own.",1256601600,23,3368,4.503267973856209
2850074,5,B000QXDEGS,"I bought a complete set for myself and another as a gift.  It is a wonderful series, even if you are not Irish.

2850114,3,B000QXDEGS,"I looked foreward to this series when it was first advertised as a comedy about an English priest in an Irish village.  I could see all kinds of possibilities for this premise and I was not disappointed for 3 seasons while Father Peter was there.  However, the decision to end the 3rd season so abruptly was very jarring, since the two principal characters disappeared in a most disturbing manner and the interplay of characters that had been so engrossing up to then took a drastic turn downward. The importation of an Irish priest destroyed the original premise and no strong or compelling storyline evolved thereafter.  Less significant characters came and went and none had the strong appeal of the first cast working together on a relatively cohesive plot.  Very disappointing letdown for an originally outstanding series.",1245024000,15,827,5.0588235294117645
2850115,4,B000QXDEGS,"We had heard about BallyK from a friend,who loaned us a season and we just loved it.  So much so, that we purchased the entire series from Amazon! This is a uniquely depicted series with a beautiful setting (Ireland), characters that are captivating, they will make you laugh and shed a tear as well. Some of the characters endure through the entire series, some not.  You will miss some of your favorites, then enjoy the new cast members.  Watch it!",1242604800,,450,4.6
2850116,1,B000QXDEGS,"I rarely give a bad (1 star) review, but this time I have to.  I love most of the BBC series, and own many of them. I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons of Ballykissangel, but when they disposed of the two main focus characters at the end of season 3, it broke my heart.  It didn't help that my best friend of 35 years died the week before I watched it, but I think the impact would still have been terrible.  I had, of course, bought the entire collection, and I truly felt it was money wasted.

I tried to watch the rest of the seasons, but I only got through season 4 before I gave the set away.

If you're tough and don't mind seeing your favorite character die or leave town, then you may still enjoy Ballykissangel.  I'm not that tough.",1239840000,8,741,4.111111111111111

2850119,3,B000QXDEGS,"I extend a thank you to the other reviewers here, for their accurate descriptions of this series. It's not simply twee, but a complex micro-universe of human issues played out in a beautiful setting. It happens to be a great deal, as each episode is a full hour long. The work and care that went into the production is evident at every turn. The Irish landscape is a starring character. We loved watching rickety Eamon playing musicals in his barn and singing to his pigs.

Seasons 1-3 stand out. Sadly, after that, the narrative of the priest and his faith diminishes quite a bit. Too bad the focus on the tensions of faith weren't explored in more depth as the series progressed. Inexplicably, way too much time is spent following the antics of Liam and Donal, they're boring versions of Laurel & Hardy, focused on monetary schemes and rip-offs. This lacks the depth of the first seasons. The actors do what they can with the material, and Season 4 has some interest with family feuds, but Season 5 disintegrates into soap-opera, with inexplicable character behavior/changes, teenage angst, and marriage dramas a la ""Knots Landing"" or ""Desperate Housewives."" The first 3 seasons created a potential momentum for the remainder of the series, that was lost. Episode 2 of Season 6 is a throw-away, reiterating the chaotic financial slapstick of seasons 4-5. The priest is faced with the an unconvincing version of romance. The whole thing ends quite abruptly. But at least it is filmed in Ireland, with better quality acting than most television series.

The idyllic Irish village is beautiful. Requited love, domestic abuse, death, loneliness, child neglect, teenage pregnancy, tensions in the Church in Ireland, secular vs. religious views are covered. I wish it had actually been more spiritual and less soap-opera; there was way too much focus on the ""Laurel & Hardy"" slapstick.

It takes its time developing the characters and themes, but once there you know and care about these subtlety good people.  Surprising plot twists, a great score and exceptional performances--I can't think of a single actor who fell short in the early years.

There's a significant transition after the third year.  I expected a letdown but it turned out to be only slightly so, at least at first.  The producers kept introducing new, interesting characters and plot lines and the photography gets even more spectacular. But into the fifth year, things do fall off, although still worthwhile.",1224720000,6,737,5.008196721311475
