4189975,3,B003T04NB0,I usually like this ''tough guy'' ... with a heart ... but this role was flat.  Not really much to the movie itself ... psycho killing off young group of lovers for an agenda ... been there. done that ... again ... and again ... and yet again,1368576000,,242,4.041666666666667
4189976,2,B003T04NB0,This was the movie that plodded along.  The Answer Man was a good movie.  I would watch it again if someone told me it was coming on tv.,1363737600,,136,3.8214285714285716
4189977,1,B003T04NB0,So bad on so many levels. Madsen couldn't even save this turd. Don't waste your time. Worst thing I've seen in several years.,1359331200,,125,4.478260869565218
4189978,1,B003T04NB0,"I usually attempt to be generous even when offering a bad review as I do not believe mean spirited commentary is useful but this movie was the worst.
The script/dialogue had to have been written by a pre-teen.  The inclusion of several well known actors did nothing to enhance the script as their performances were stereotypical and uninspired.  One point of interest...I do believe the banjo player was actually the boy (now grown) who played in the famous dueling banjo scene from Deliverance.  His eyes are the same and age seems correct.",1349913600,,541,4.858695652173913
4189979,1,B003T04NB0,"Not surprised one of the good reviews was from the director.... only someone involved in the production of this catastrophe would dare say it was any good. Do not waste your time with this movie - the story was silly, the acting horrible (especially the lead girl) and the characters did stereotypically stupid things. I cannot believe I made it through the whole movie. I hope my contributed rating of 1 star helps bring the overall rating a bit closer to what it deserves although I would have given it a zero if I could have.",1326412800,,528,4.510416666666667
4189980,1,B003T04NB0,This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!! Don't waste your money on this one...,1320969600,,104,4.25
4189981,5,B003T04NB0,"This was a cool movie that delved into more than a shoot-em-up movie would ever do........ The moral lessons taught in this movie will last a viewer a life time !!!

It was great to see Michael Madsen in this one, he is a classic !!!

The tie ins to Deliverance and other movies was neat, so I think this film will become a cult classic and I recommend watching it.....",1298246400,7,369,4.183098591549296
4189982,5,B003T04NB0,"This is film is filled with suspense, excitment, and drama with a positive message in the end.  This film not only will entertain you, but will also teach you something about life.  The character ""Billy"" played by Pauly D is one of the best actors in the film.  He narrates and interjects life messages through out the movie.  It not only entertains you with action and suspense, but gives you something to think about.  ""What you have in your heart is what you attract in  your life"" is the message of this thriller.  Seriously, folks that is some deep stuff here about life.  If you think about what we all are attracting in our lives, either good or bad, is really what we have inside of us. I would highly recommend this film to everyone.  It is a must see film!",1289952000,4,766,4.375886524822695

4189986,1,B003T04NB0,One of the worst movies ever and I have seen my fair share of flops. Even Michael couldn't save this disaster.... This movie couldn't get our of it's own way.....,1447632000,,162,4.433333333333334
4189987,3,B003T04NB0,not great but not bad. good enough I enjoyed it. You can see most of it coming. but there is a lot of deep thoughts that come up as sub plots. worth a watch.,1446163200,,157,3.6470588235294117

4189990,3,B003T04NB0,The movie was okay. Didn't really understand the plot,1436745600,,53,5.0
4189991,5,B003T04NB0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was a form of the good, the bad, and the ugly that comes from the heart. The plot was intriguing from the very beginning. The plot does twist and turn during the movie leaving you a bit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next scenes that follow. Even with the violence that is in this movie, the movie has a wonderful essence to it as well. However, it is one that you must be able to have an open mind, and heart to truly understand the goodness within this movie. Myself, I loved this movie. I am a Michael Madsen fan, and I feel he played his part in this movie very well. This is not a movie that some may understand. However, I will be watching it again, and again in the time to come.",1434844800,,728,4.027586206896552

4189997,1,B003T04NB0,I felt that this movie was too contrived and did not really get into it. I could tell what was going to happen all the way through it.,1398902400,,134,3.8214285714285716

4190001,1,B003T04NB0,I don't know much about this film. I did not see Mike Madsen anywhere in it. But it was so bad that I had to turn it off after about 10 minutes. I seriously doubt whether I was even watching the right film! I think they have the wrong film loaded to play when you select this one. It looked nothing like what was described on the listing.,1384473600,,338,3.985294117647059
4190002,1,B003T04NB0,"To be honest, I only watched this because Michael Madsen is in it.  It was terrible but I have to admit I watched the whole thing.  I guess it's the old train wreck metaphor.",1371254400,,174,4.088235294117647

8404870,1,B003T04NB0,"This is by far one of the worst and most stupid movies I have ever started watching, I could only watch until the scene where the two girls and the one guy run away, after their friend was killed and his ""spirit"" came out of his body.  Couldn't have ever imagined Michael Madsen to lower himself to this level of humiliation just to be in a movie.  Do not rent, do not buy and please, if you respect yourself as a human being, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, it is trash, just plain TRASH.",1491696000,,482,4.117021276595745
