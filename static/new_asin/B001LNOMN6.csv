3688274,1,B001LNOMN6,"Have to say it maybe a old movie but a very weak one wouldn't even rate it , this will end up in the bin.",1371600000,,105,3.24
3688275,5,B001LNOMN6,I found this movie oddly charming. It had something heroic about it. At no point did I feel a vicarious thrill in some kind of depraved sexual act. This is more like an absurd buddy movie in the context of the dark underworld of human trafficking.,1365638400,2,247,4.391304347826087
3688276,1,B001LNOMN6,"You get what you pay for. Just because this movie came out in the 70s I thought it would be better than this. Some of the movies from the 60s and 70s are pretty good but not this one. Don't recommend watching this, it is just a waste of time.",1356566400,2,242,3.86
3688277,5,B001LNOMN6,it's about a trade market of young girls being used as slaves to every male in the world. and living off there sex and money.,1351814400,2,125,4.04
3688278,3,B001LNOMN6,"This movie is better than I anticipated. There was almost a decent plot to support the film, as well as some mediocre character development. But the point is that it isn't a horrible movie. While it isn't the best movie, there is an attractive and interesting quality about the storyline-which is to rescue a kidnapped girl. There was a lack of strong character development, but in the same token the audience finds out what they need to know for the characters to fit the plot well. Overall, it is worth purchasing and watching.",1290902400,11,529,4.698924731182796
3688279,1,B001LNOMN6,"Still wish Amazon would allow 0 stars, I didn't want to do this review because I'm embarrassed that I bought this.  So as punishment I am forcing my self to write this.  BAD  BAD BAD  Don't fall for the hype about this being a classic retro movie from the ""70"".  Its a total waist of time.  Bad everything, acting,script,film quality,  The other reviewer gave it 2 stars.  WHY? WHY? WHY?",1279238400,42,387,4.428571428571429
3688280,2,B001LNOMN6,"OK, once again I fall for the product details for a wretched movie, so I have no one to blame for my hideous judgement call, but hopefully, I can stop you from making the same mistake. The synopsis utilizes the word 'sleazy' four times in one sentence, so already I'm curious as to how this one slipped under my radar for all things perverse. These thing can happen, even to the jaded, so I'm thinking this one belongs in my collection. Wrong. First off, the specs state it's a 35mm print, and the picture's so muddy and washed out it looks like an 8mm movie. It also states that it's from 1973, and watching it I can't believe it's not from the mid/late 60's. Brad Harris and Tony Kendall are awful in this Eurospy Eurofailure, and the only nudity is a couple of topless babes tied to bamboo poles on said island. Girls are kidnapped and sold into slavery, but we don't get to see more than I've stated. The climax is a bunch of Thai smugglers mud-wrestling British police to save the girls from captivity - if there's gotta be a mudfight, wouldn't NOW be the time to bring in the captive women? A huge letdown from Sinister Cinema, but I have no one to blame but myself - when will I learn?",1275868800,89,1192,4.325892857142857

8318944,1,B001LNOMN6,"This was pretty laughable, which is the reason I rented it. Being a B monster movie fan, I wanted to see how they did the giant ants. I don't think I watched the whole thing. I would watch the whole thing if Science Theater 3000 lampooned it.",1479254400,,242,4.170212765957447

8318951,3,B001LNOMN6,"OK Euro-made English-dubbed Kommissar X adventure with Brad Harris and Tony Kendall.  They play a couple of spies trying to crack a ring of white slavers.  The action is constant and the two stars are good-looking, especially Brad Harris.  Looks like it was made in the late '60s or early '70s.  I ordered via Movies Unlimited and what I received was a fair quality DVD-R made by an obscure source.  The quality is probably no better than what can be obtained from Sinister Cinema.  This film needs to be re-mastered but probably never will be.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1411344000,,580,4.683168316831683
