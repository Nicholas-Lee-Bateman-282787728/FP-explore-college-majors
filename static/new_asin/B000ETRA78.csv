8484877,5,B000ETRA78,"I've watched these three discs several times and will use them as a teaching tool to introduce students to the 3 major trends in 18th & 19th Century English poetry and to specific poets of each moevment. Each discs provides a great introduction to a major movement in English poetry: Augustan, Romantic & Victorian, then focuses on 3-5 of the major poets of that movement. Augustan poets: Dryden, Pope & Dr. Johnson. Romantic poets: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron & Shelley. Victorian poets: Tennyson, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold & Gerard Manly Hopkins. Highly recommended as a learning and teaching tool!",1395100800,5,614,5.212121212121212
