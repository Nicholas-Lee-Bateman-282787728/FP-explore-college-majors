7864402,5,6304043406,"Tropic Of Desire was released in 1979. It stars Barbara Baxley as a wild clothing designer tearing it up on an island. with a male hustler. Great support is provided by Eartha Kitt in a Blonde wig ! Pat Carroll, Don Porter, and Tom Ewell add much in their small roles. 1970's model Matt Collins in his only starring role in the movies. Lots of Disco music in this one. I loved this one ! Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1471046400,,429,4.119047619047619
7864403,3,6304043406,"This is a wacky one from 1979 which will probably not make it to DVD. It takes place in the Florida keys. The highlight is Miss Eartha Kitt as Lola, not perched on a barrel, but in a blond wig and purring her way through some tacky numbers. The bi husler with the butterfly patch on his jeans is a riot as well as Barbara Baxley as a socialite who uses his services. Tom Ewell, former co-star of Mansfield and Monroe, has a comeo role. It is directed by famed adult film maker Bob Chinn, who directed some of john Holmes most memorial films. Maybe this was his stab at the big time. He failed- luckily for us camp film lovers. Silly fun soap opera with a hunky star who can't act and never wen't on to anything much.",1208131200,,716,4.158273381294964
7864404,3,6304043406,"I bought this video, because Eartha Kitt acts and SINGS in it , and with a spectacular , bizarre WHITE wig on !SHE 's always fun!
For me, as a fan of Eartha's, that was more than enough .
Story is a thin one. Matt Collins is a goodlooking hot'n juicy hustler
 (or should i say GOLDDIGGER ?) Altogether not so bad, but definately NOT an A or even B-movie. Dated too ( it's from 1997!)Fans of Eartha should definately buy this one though.",1080432000,,436,4.190476190476191
