Wataru is still determined to go out with Mai the girl of his dreams, and yet there are even more difficult obsticles for him to overcome.  From Mai's  over-protective father, to Wataru's jerk friend, to Mai's own doubts about  herself, End of Summer 2 tells a very mature story about how love can  overcome any obsticle.
It's an honest look at a real romantic story and  portrays the characters and how they feel about each other a very mature  light.  Mai is a girl trapped in the image of a class princess and needs  Wataru to help her express who she really is.  Wataru is determined to show  Mai just how much he has come to care for her, but needs Mai's strength and  courage to overcome the final obsticle.
One last comment, make sure you  watch the credits, or you'll miss the ending :)
