1706065,1,B0000648X1,"From the previews that I'd seen of ""Slackers"" I thought that it was a college type comedy like PCU and Road Trip.  It certainly has taken some of it's few comedic momments from both these movies.  There is no classifying this movie, it isn't all that funny.  Plus, the whole thing with the Ethan character, played by Rushmore's Jason Schwartzmann, is just totally bizarre.
Why is this movie called ""Slackers""?  It really should have been called ""Cheaters"".  Was that title already taken?
It could've been called ""Stalker"".  Ethan stalks and obsesses with the female lead character, Angela, who wants pretty much nothing to do with him.
I will not say much more about this film because I thought it was a travesty of the teen/college comedy genre.  I have liked other movies I thought were weird, but this film had nothing else to offer. There isn't much originality here, and it just makes teens today look as if they have no scope to their imaginations when it comes to what they consider humerous in a movie.  We have had far too many films with the same brand of sick humor.
Also,  even though his character is twisted psychotic Ethan, Jason Schwartzman was very good.  The rest of the actors were nothing special.  Unless you are male, you may appreciate Mamie Van Doren's scene.
I don't recommend this film at all. Watch ""Animal House"" for a great comedy set in a college and put this one back.",1022803200,2,1399,4.646341463414634
1706066,3,B0000648X1,"Say what you want about the film, but don't blame the writer. Hollywood insiders know that David H. Steinberg (""American Pie 2"") wrote a brilliant script that started a bidding war back in 1999, but was rewritten by Craig Mazin (""Senseless"" and ""Rocketman"") who delivered the final shooting script. The studio (Destination Films) went out of business, but not before first-time director Dewey Nicks could demonstrate his sheer incompetence by stomping all over the once-revered script. But the film always gets a fierce reaction (good and bad), so it's worth checking out for yourself. And, by the way, the original script is available online ...",1021766400,2,646,5.161904761904762
1706067,3,B0000648X1,"compared to what most people say i think this is a very good movie. the problem with the film was probably the trailers for it. they showed it as this slapstick comedy with a popular rock soundtrack. in reality it is somewhat of a dark comedy with really strange music. anyway, this movie still has it's very funny moments. as i said earlier this movie is very weird and creepy. just the way the characters act you can tell they're not normal. the best actor in this by far is Jason Schwartzman who steals the show. his two songs in it are hilarious. but in short this movie should be seen with an open mind and knowing the fact that you're not going to see a goofy movie.",1021593600,2,672,4.2578125

If you want to see a bunch of off color jokes made with no real fun factor then this is the film to watch.  If you want a smart sex-comedy that will make you laugh while still delivering the goods then this is the film to avoid.  Devon Sawa is your star here, the bad boy who learns a valuable lesson about scamming on the hot chick.  That hot chick is Jaime (James) King, who plays Angela, the girl of nerdy stalker boy Ethan's (Jason Schwartzman) dreams.

Maronna of `The Adventures of Pete and Pete' fame) to play match maker between him and Angela, but Angela ends up falling for Dave and then the truth is spilled and hearts are broken, but we all know how it ends because we've all seen this done a million times before, except it's been done better, smarter and much funnier!

1706123,1,B0000648X1,". . . . . is that it's actually being discussed. I'm pretty down about the fact that I have so few ways in which to usefully spend my time that I am offering an opinion on this excrement. Exploitation of aging film stars is nothing new and if they are willing to be exploited then who am I to complain?; there's nothing objectionable about seeing a naked body on the screen, in my opinion; we all do stupid and regrettable things in our youth and they are, potentially, funny. However, certain crimes against the viewing public are inexcusable, namely the fact that WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE, SO MANY TIMES. I, personally, feel insulted that we are being offered this crud but am also aware of a sense of doom that people are actually getting laughs from the tired, old, flogged cliches (you know, sock over turgid member, lustful older woman, kooky student, BOY WHO REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS etc., etc., etc). As a final tirade and the most astounding feature of all the reviews that have appeared before is that some so beguiled by their own ""insights"" that they are reviewing this film in a pseudo-academic manner. I was sure the word ""ouvre"" (if that's how it's spelt) would appear somewhere. Please, someone, tell me that nobody has yet written a PhD thesis on campus comedy, that most banal of film types. Please!!! Otherwise, truthfully, any pretension that we are an intelligent species may as well be buried once and for all.
Yes, this is a truly terrible film in every sense of the word. It is a ""comedy"" that is genuinely depressing but we're getting pretty used to being fed swill now, am I right? And some are becoming quite fond of the taste . . .",1163203200,2,1667,4.5049504950495045
1706124,3,B0000648X1,"If a stranger were to walk up to me and with a straight face ask me if Slackers is worth the rental ... I would pause, consider the options, and finally say, boldly, ""yes"".  For me, Slackers wasn't a poor film, but it wasn't, by far, the greatest comedy ever written.  I am basing this fact on the ""laugh"" factor.  For a reason that I cannot explain, I found myself mildly entertained by this film.  I don't know if it was the constantly changing tone of the film, or the fact that Schwartzman pulled the comedy off with the greatest of skills, but this meager film critic found some value in this little off-beat comedy.  I will have to whole-heartedly agree with other critics that Slackers was clich, random, and at times, very very dull, but overall it seemed to fit.  I have found quite a bit of articles comparing this film to the infamous American Pie movie, but to me, it seemed more like a less-nudity, less-bodily gas humor version of Animal House.  The intelligence skirted around this film, at times entering in it providing one or two great moments, but overall it couldn't counter the random blandness that seemed to further creep in, surpassing the greatness.

I think we should begin with the good of this film, because again, it is what stood out greater in the scheme of it all.  Jason Schwartzman.  Bar none he carried this film.  From his random songs, the great scenes in which he ""volunteers"" with Angela, and his well-celebrated hair doll, Schwartzman was funny.  In fact, as you watch this film, one could say that in each scene Jason is honored to be in, he dominates them.  His lines are not just perfect, but his mannerisms seem to also accentuate his character very well.  Schwartzman is worth the price of the rental alone.  Outside of me just drooling on Jason's character ""Cool Ethan"", I thought that the sporadic (and need I say random) way that this film was actually filmed, with the ""Magic Number"" relapse, the true way to help Ethan find a girl, and the singing sock - of which that is all I believe I can say.  These enjoyable interjections made Slackers a bit more unique.  I wasn't expecting this level of satire for such a small film.  It felt like director Dewey Nicks did his comedy homework.  He knew how to make some people laugh.  Now, I am not saying that he graduated from Comedy College, but he did finish his homework early as well as do the extra credit.

Jason Schwartzman was phenomenal in this film, but those that accompanied him deserve some respect as well.  While I think that Devon Sawa was struggling in this film (see next paragraph), his co-conspirators held their own.  Jason Segel reminded me of a young Ken Marino, just not as funny) and Michael C. Maronna had a funny bit or two.  Laura Prepon, of That 70s Show fame, added some flair to the duller moments, but seemed more like eye-candy than any sort of actual actor value.  The hair doll was an odd, yet fun element.  I don't want to drool over Schwartzman in this entire review, but it was entire do to him that this film did not fail in my eyes.  He was short, spastic, and completely unappreciated by other critics.  This was one of those small films that allowed Schwartzman to fully grow and demonstrate his humorous ability.  I could go on for some time, but I have to discuss the ultimate pitfalls of this film.

Slackers was funny, but it wasn't great.  I don't think I could bear to watch a second time.  While I previously drooled over the amazing comic ability of Schwartzman, he could not match the downfalls of this film.  There was not visible plot.  There was a very clich storyline that could be viewed in nearly every other film of this genre, but nothing that immediately stood out.  While I did just mention how amazing the one to four humorous imaginative scenes were (thus making it a memorable film - not just forgettable), there were plenty of faulty scenes that followed.  I would have to criticize Jaime King for her very poor acting in this film.  She was purely placed in Slackers to advance the story, nothing more, nothing less.  Her lines were wooden, her character was trite, and nothing was appealing about her in the least.  She attempted some comedy, but obviously could not handle the talent that surrounded her.  The same could be said about the ending of this film.  While I did think that it wrapped up decently well (for a comedy college film), there were increasingly more random moments (one featuring Cameron Diaz) and less actual character development.  I wasn't expecting a character driven story here, but I was expecting to know this trio a bit more.  I would have loved some history on ""Cool Ethan"" and his demonic love for Angela.  I felt that everything suddenly situated at the end of the school year.  Why couldn't we have seen Ethan's passion for Angela grow instead of tossed directly in our faces?  I just seemed that Nicks should have expanded his comedy segments, developed a funnier story with Ethan, and given us a stronger female lead, and he would have had a keeper of a film.  Instead, he force-fed us mediocrity, until we could not do anything but enjoy it.

Overall, I liked Slackers for trying to break the genre norm.  Did it succeed in being imaginative and original?  My answer world be ""no"", but it did give over 100% in trying.  For those wanting to see Schwartzman roots, this would be a great place to start.  I will agree that he was playing from his Rushmore character a bit to much, but I didn't mind.  He was out of the box and insane at all the right places, bringing some much needed chuckles to the film.  I could not watch this film a second time, which is a bit downfall.  You can always tell how good a film is by the level of return watching, but Slackers had none.  I would recommend it to friends, but not as more than a one-night viewing.  It definitely had some potential, director Nicks just chose not to exploit it.

1706125,4,B0000648X1,"Quite a few mixed reviews here, and that's too bad that some people have to overanalyze a simple movie like this, designed to distract you from your own troubles for just under an hour and a half. Slackers is short, but if it went on any longer it would most likely lose it's charm. I don't want to ruin it for first-time watchers, but the beginning is just great once you realize what is happening (and you will unless you're on the not-so-bright side). As explained by countless reviewers, a group of guys at college cheat their way through school. They have quite the plan, but what they don't plan on is that their friend Dave (Devon Sawa) has slipped his number to the gorgeous Angela during the exam, which she leaves behind and Cool Ethan (Schwartzman) while analyzing her chair for pieces of her hair finds the number and blackmails Dave and his friends. Cool Ethan has a terribly unhealthy obsession with Angela and he wants the guys to help him get her to go out with him or he'll blow their whole cheating scheme and get them kicked out of college. Unfortunately, Dave has fallen for Angela. So now he needs to choose between keeping the cheating under wraps or being with Angela. And it's a whole lot of fun finding out what happens next. It's not the type of movie that gives you an epiphany or makes you think about life, but it's fun and quite funny. I've never liked Schwartzman but he is perfect for the role of Cool Ethan here.

The object of desire in this peurile flick is Jamie King, who finds herself caught between a pscyhopathic nerd (Schwartzman) and a two-bit con artist (Sawa).

Not overly side splitting, as was Animal House, but not a complete waste of celluloid either, I found myself laughing out loud during a few scenes (most of which included Schwartzman and cameo players Mamie Van Doren and Cameron Diaz). So...if you're looking for the next academy award winner, this isn't it.  If you have an hour and a half to burn, and enjoy fluff movies, this movie will probably sit alright with you.

1706165,3,B0000648X1,"Seeing as it deals with youthful eccentrics searching for love, costars Jason Schwartzman, and presents the idea of stalking from a humorous perspective (a perspective, one might venture a wild guess, not neccesarily shared by people who have actually been stalked), it is tempting (and thoroughly incorrect) to describe Slackers as a raunchier, darker version of Rushmore.  In fact, to use such a description would be a strong disservice to both films.  For whereas Rushmore is one of the best films of the last decade (and this film most assuredly is not), Slackers is an uneven film that -- while not being all that good -- is still entertaining when taken on it's own terms and certainly is a step above most of the teen-age/college stoner comedies to have come out in the wake of American Pie.
The story is almost painfully familiar.  Jason Schwartzman is a disturbed college student with a massive crush on the sweetly attractive James King.  In order to trick her into not only noticing him but eventually going out with him, Schwartzman blackmails three cocky cheaters into helping him con her into giving him her affections.  Unfortunately, the head cheater is played by Devon Sawa who, while not being half the actor that Schwartzman is, is much better looking and as such, King immediately falls for him and he falls for her and the rest of the movie deals with how to deal with Schwartzman.  As said, none of the movie's particular plot points are extremely clever and a lot of the humor falls flat.  Particularly annoying is the director's need to pad out the film with the same boring fantasy sequences that seem to pop up in all stoner youth comedies nowadays.  Scored to kitschy pop standards from the early '70s (the type of stuff these slackers wouldn't be caught dead listening to in real life), these fantasy sequences are filled with unoriginal takeoffs on better films and tend to stop the action dead -- not good for a film that feels overlong to begin with.
Still, for every dead spot, there's a bizarrely inspired joke or a skillful performance that'll pop up unexpectedly and these good moments are so inspired and provide such a strong pay-off that the viewer is almost left feeling as if he's being rewarded for managing to make it through the bad moments.  It's as if the director is saying, ""Sorry about making that 20th joke about flatulence, here's a little Jason Schwartzman to help ease the pain.""  Certainly, Schwartzman is the film's main strength.  Playing yet another eccentric, overly intelligent stalker-type, Schwartzman creates a character that is 180 degrees the opposite of his starring turn in Rushmore.  He brings a manic intensity to his creepy role that is fascinating to watch -- both because of the skill of his performance and because of the fact that this is a rare actor who is willing to push against all self-imposed limits while on screen.  The audience finds themselves tolerating a lot of uninspired bits just for the chance to find out what Schwartzman's going to do next.  Schwartzman pulls off a minor miracle, giving a perfect comedic performance as a character who, when you actually get to the heart of the matter, isn't all that funny.  However, Schwartzman is not the sole redemption to be found in this film's cast as James King, while stuck playing a symbol (the ""good girl""), still manages to be very sweet and adorable (in the best sense of the term) as the unwitting object of Schwartzman's affections.  For this film to work, you have to be willing to buy that so many people would be willing to make idiots out of themselves to win the heart of one, individual woman and luckily, King manages to embody that woman, much in the same way that Cameron Diaz helped to lend some credibility to the far superior There's Something About Mary.  As for the star of the film, Devon Sawa doesn't get to display the flair of wild comedy that distinguished his work in Idle Hands (truly the only role to give him a chance to definitely distinguish himself from the current crop of 20-something pretty boys wondering around Hollywood) but he's still a likeable enough protaganist.  If he doesn't get a chance to be as interesting as Schwartzman, he also doesn't allow this film to turn into Freddie Prinze, Jr. vehicule either.  And while most of the direction is rather uninspired, there are still a few moments of inspired lunacy that'll either annoy you or leave you in hysterics depending on your taste in humor.  (A bit with a singing gym sock is probably the best example of this.)  These bits of inspired lunacy are too few and too far between to make up for the fact that this is -- overall -- a rather uneven mess of a film but, for what their worth, they're there and they certainly make the film a bit more interesting than most of the shlock being churned out nowadays.
Slackers isn't a great film.  It's probably not even a good film.  But it is a film with some great strengths to go along with its far too numerous flaws.  If you're in the mood for this type of film, there are definitely worse ways to lose 90 minutes of your life.",1048291200,,5106,4.685682326621924

It is an unrelenting series of unfunny, mean-spirited ""gags"" without a shred of narrative cohesion and not a single likeable character. If you enjoyed movies like American Pie, There's Something About Mary, Road Trip or Van Wilder; avoid this stinker at all costs, it is nothing like any of those films.",1032912000,2,407,4.746478873239437
1706199,2,B0000648X1,"Just when you begin to think that the teen movie genre can't get any worse, along comes a film like ""Slackers"" to remind us that barrel-bottom scraping has long stood as one of Hollywood's most lucrative and time-honored traditions.
""Slackers"" features a trio of amoral buddies who spend most of their time devising elaborate schemes to help each other cheat their way through college.  Starting from this rather dubious premise, the film proceeds to encompass every clich&eacute; from every teen comedy ever made.  With few exceptions, the characters are all unlikable oafs, some of whom actually seem to be suffering from serious cases of mental illness.  It's a little difficult to laugh when you begin to see someone as a genuine threat to the safety and welfare of other people in the vicinity.
As with most youth comedies, ""Slackers"" serves up a plethora of crude sex gags, only in this case, none of them comes across as particularly witty or imaginative.  In an attempt to achieve a certain ""originality"" the film also throws in a few ""fantasy"" sequences that fall flat through sheer lack of inspiration.  Moreover, the college classroom scenes are all appallingly unconvincing, particularly in terms of the kinds of shenanigans that are permitted during test-taking times.  And the silly, all's-forgiven ending rings as hollow as everything else in the film.
""Slackers"" bombed big time at the box office upon its release in early 2002.  Perhaps that shows that Hollywood CAN go broke underestimating the intelligence of its audience after all.  It gives one cause for hope.",1027987200,2,1582,5.081081081081081
1706200,4,B0000648X1,"If your looking for a pseudo American Pie, you've found it. With slap stick humor an boat loads of sextual situations an enuendo this movie is funny. The acting is suprisingly good for a comedy, the Character ""Cool Ethan"" is one you will hate forever after seeing this movie. And when he dispences nicknames like ""Laser"" how could you like him. This is a bizzare but funny movie",1026691200,,378,4.573529411764706
1706201,5,B0000648X1,"it was the funnest , the most sweet the most dramitic movie i ever seen  and ive seen my fair share.it about these three guys who have cheated their way though every thing high school collage jobs everthing but one wronge move cost them everything. they get blackmailed into helping this total freak too get this hot babe who is total out of his leage but dave who is the one who has to get this girl to like the freak falls for her and the movie takes of from there my fravate part is th sock on one of the guys .... well i won't runion it for you but its lauh out lough funny. if you don't buy it rent it now",1025222400,,610,3.9193548387096775
1706202,5,B0000648X1,"This is one of those movies that once again proves that the simpler it is, the better it is. Basically you got three buddies that have never done anything honestly, a hot girl, and a freak who collects the hot girls hair and forms it into a doll. And by the end of the movie, everybody learns their own lesson about life, love, and being a psycho. I definitley recommend this one.",1024876800,,380,4.291666666666667
1706203,2,B0000648X1,"The movie overall was bad.  It had a pretty weak plot.  The casting was overall good (note cameron diaz has an interesting cameo) But if you like stupid fun, then this movie is for you.  If you saw it in the theater and wanted to rent it to see if more good/sick stuff was cut out.  Don't bother. I guess since it didn't make much money, the company thought no one would rent it either.  There are no extra features.  I was very disappointed about that.",1024704000,2,453,4.209302325581396
1706204,5,B0000648X1,"I loved this movie, it is very cute not weird at all. Jason Schwartzman plays a deranged psycho but is a total dork & can't even get stalking right.  They aren't slackers but a bunch of cheaters who spend as much energy trying to cheat as they would if they had studied.  In all I highly recommend this movie, its
not going to win any oscars but is good for a laugh.",1024358400,,366,4.069444444444445
1706205,3,B0000648X1,"The comedy Slackers features Devon Sawa, James King, and Jason Schwartzman. It also has Laura Prepon, Jason Segel, and Michael Maronna. Dave (Sawa) and his friends do many wacky things just to cheat their way through collage. Then Dave made his fatal mistake, having an arguement with Ethan (Schwartzman) over a seat. Ethan discovers Dave cheating and blackmails him. Ethan wants Dave and his two friends to help him get a girl, Angela (King).Slackers is an okay comedy. The plot is something different from other teen comedies that have been getting created lately. Even though it made less than  five million dollars at the box office (4.8 million to be technical), you may find it as the unexpected hit comedy you've been looking for. You might also find it to be a horrible film. (See it if you like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) I give Slackers a CAUTIOUS recommendation.",1024185600,,878,4.814569536423841
1706206,5,B0000648X1,"Now I understand why the critics did not love this movie. It is neither deep nor ground-breaking in any way shape or form. But, I think that most people will find that it is quite hilarious! Jason Schwartzmann is ridiculous and entertaining as the psychotic stalker of the movie, and all of his scenes will make you laugh so hard that you'll nearly pee your pants. And of course all girls fall for the adorable Devon Sawa (I'm tellin ya- no one can resist that beautiful smile) So if you want an intelligent comedy or a groundbreaking movie experience rent something else, but if you are in the mood for a [funny] college comedy then by all means- THIS is the one to watch. I promise you won't be dissapointed.",1023062400,8,710,4.469230769230769
