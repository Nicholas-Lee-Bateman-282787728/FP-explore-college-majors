3921950,5,B002FLOTPO,I'm excited to see that the entire series is available in a set now and Amazon is selling it cheaper than the three seasons sold individually.  I have fond memories of this show.  It was one of the shows that I used to stay up to watch.  In the last season it sort of fizzled out but I'd still like to see it again.,1252368000,23,315,3.890625

The DVDs aren't enhanced with great resolution but this show never was really so it wouldn't be as authentic if they messed with it, in my opinion.

3921968,5,B002FLOTPO,"this is a fun series to watch. not so much for younger viewers, has nothing to do with the movie franchise!  It is about an antique store owner who sells his soul to the devil and then he curses all the antiques in his shop and then sells them. well he tried to back out  of the deal and the devil was not having it and killed him.  He left the store to his niece and nephew who have no idea what they inherited.  well to say the least they have a going out of business sell and they sell off the rest of the objects.  they find a book hidden in the ceiling and it lists all of the cursed objects and who they were sold to , they experience a demonic event that makes them believers of what their uncle did and now for the rest of the series they have to find the objects and return them to the store and store them in a special vault. the antiques can never be destroyed because of the devils curse!",1473379200,,900,3.9502762430939224
3921969,5,B002FLOTPO,"This is a 5 star purchase, but you need to know and understand what you are getting yourself into.

This set includes all 3 seasons of the old 80s show, Friday the 13th. This is not the same as the movie series. Also note, although this is sold as a ""set"" it is not a boxed set. It is 3 DVDs packaged together. There is no box, and it doesn't look like anything other than just 3 DVDs together. That said, unless you are expecting a fancy box set, this is just fine! All DVDs are included and play just as they would were they boxed any other way. This is not necessarily a downfall, just a warning (in case you were expecting otherwise).

The quality is fine. It's 80s filming, so don't expect 2015 quality. The show is what it is. If you liked the series on TV, well, obviously this is exactly the same thing (minus the commercials, WINNING), so it's great. This is a fun, cheesy, 80s show, and I love it.

The price on this set fluctuates often. Keep checking back, or use a price tracking website. I bought it at almost $32 for the set, which is a killer deal. That's only $1.88 per disc! Amazing deal, so don't let them take you on a significantly higher price.",1473033600,,1166,4.219730941704036

3922004,5,B002FLOTPO,"Highly recommend this TV series to anyone who appreciates good horror! Please keep in mind though that this TV series is NOT based off the popular movie franchise with murderous Jason Voorhees, but tries to focus on the calendar date that pops up a few times during the year. Everyone knows that the date of Friday the 13th is a superstitious day in and of itself and that many weird things can happen on that day, this show embodies that superstition and occult connection with it's stories of cursed objects. Granted, the camera shots and special effects are clearly dated, but the storylines are sound. The combination of history and horror is brilliant and at the time, was highly unheard of.  If you enjoy moments that make you go ""Oh Wow!"" or ""No way!"" then this is definitely a series for you!",1459123200,,800,4.633802816901408

Sad on how this show got negative reviews just because some people where mad that this series dosen't have anything to do with the Jason movies. The main story line in this series deals with 3 people who inherited an antique store from their uncle who made a packed with the devil & now they have to track down antiques that are cursed by the devil. Each episode there's a different object they have to find.

Definitely recommend if you're a fan of good, suspenseful horror themed TV series!!",1457827200,,756,4.3546099290780145

3922043,5,B002FLOTPO,"The only bad thing about this series is it died without a closing finalle that would have made this Friday the 13th an awesome collectors edition. Unfortunately the series just drops off a cliff with the last episode no closure at all. However that said this is still a set worth owning. Friday the 13th  had some awesome and funny things in it that had to be recovered.  Oh yeah this is not Friday the 13th  that tracks from the movies of the same namd.  This Friday the 13th references a anitique shop was run by what I can only call a satanist. Anyway the shop ower somehow ran afoul of his master and he, his shop and everything in it was cursed. The sick twisted shop owner meets his demise sort of since he makes a few reappearances during the three season run. He returns as the incarnation of evil each time he visits. It appears he becomes one of satans many stooges.

Anyways good people inheirit this shop and make it their business literally to recover all the cursed objects sold by mistake and on purpose in the past. Each cursed object does something wonderful at first or so it appears but each object demands a repayment that is far more distructive than the good thing granted.  You get to see how otherwise good people and bad people get corrupted by the cursed objects. Once you see one of these episodes and know the formula the rest of the episodes will never shock you much. A few episodes have what might be called happy endings but most end with the possessor of a cursed object getting their cummupence. Some even richly deserve their vile end.

The video quality is generally very good.  Thwe scenes are nice clear and crisp.  The color and saturation is generally very good.  The sound is very good about an 8 out of 10 in both audio and video quality. Packaging is good. Value for price is good.  If you enjoyed this series back when it was new there is really no reason not to buy this because; for its time it was awesome. It is not the X Files but it is nice in its own right.",1435276800,13,2008,4.342245989304812

One of the things I've noticed now that I can binge watch the DVDs is that the show seems to get darker as it goes on. My wife liked it in the early years because she thought it was more whimsical, now she won't watch it with me anymore. The video quality is okay. I imagine it would look better on a standard def TV... The colors are somewhat washed out but I can't say for sure that it wasn't like that in the 90s. I like it, now I just need to pick up the rest of Tales From the Darkside and the complete Monsters DVDs. Good times. For those that haven't seen the show it isn't about Jason. It follows a group of people who are trying to recover demonic antiques and usually each episode has its own story.",1431043200,,818,4.086956521739131

3922069,5,B002FLOTPO,"Friday the 13th, The Series, which is set in Chicago but made in Canada, is my favorite cheesy tv show from the '80s. The camerawork and music are excellent, the plots are engaging, the portrayal of pure evil is convincing, the Canadian accents are funny (especially when the actors try to mimic the accent of the Deep South in the episode ""Hate on your Dial"") and the women are beautiful. Besides Chris Wiggins (a first-rate actor) and Louise Robey, the show boasts many outstanding veteran actors and up-and-coming actors as guest stars, including:Ray Walston (from ""My Favorite Martian""), Val Avery (who appeared in several ""Columbo"" episodes), David Proval (later would star in ""The Sopranos""), Denis Forest (who appeared in lots of Sci-Fi Channel shows in the '80s), Keye Luke (who appeared in ""Star Trek, The Original Series""), veteran TV actor from the '60s and '70s Fritz Weaver, veteran actor Michael Constantine (who was on TV way back as early as the original PERRY MASON series), veteran Western actor R.G. Armstrong (ditto), long-time '70s movie star Carrie Snodgress, disco star Vanity, Colin Fox, Billy Drago, John Byner, Gwynyth Walsh (who played the female Klingon B'Etor in ""Star Trek, TNG""), Jack Creley (who was in DR.

3922086,5,B002FLOTPO,"I bought the entire series on DVD after only having seen a handful of episodes on the Chiller channel and I personally felt it was worth it, especially since the price was so reasonable for the pack with all three seasons and the quality of the product is high (more on the actual product below). Very fun show and some episodes truly are creepy.  The formula for most of the run is more or less the same which I guess some people might feel is a flaw.  There are some episodes that don't follow the formula exactly but for the most part it's the same so I don't really binge-watch the show.

If you are the type who picks at everything like ""that would never happen"" or ""that is so unrealistic"" then I would not bother with this show. It is not meant to be realistic and in real life none of this stuff would happen, Micki and Ryan would not really be able to get away with interfering in police business, etc, etc. This is not a series to be taken too seriously or to be taken for more than what it is.

As far as the quality of the actual DVDs and packaging: the DVD sets are high quality with good and solid packaging--all discs are on separate clips and do not overlap (you don't have to unclip one to get to another) and the cases are solid (more like they were when DVDs were first made, unlike the crap cases they make now).  The discs have simple menus and there are a few special features (nothing overly exciting).  My only complaint is that there is no ""play all"" feature which, in my opinion, completely sucks to not have.

I have heard other people complain about the DVD transfer being only so-so and looking too much like it did when it was originally on (wow!) and there have been complaints that there was no digital re-mastering done for the DVD release but come on--this is a TV show from the 80's so it's going to look a little old and fuzzy just as it looked back when it first aired.  I personally have no issues with the transfer. It's fine with me and in my opinion it looks as it should--like an 80's horror anthology show.  I like that it looks old because to me that just adds to the feel, but not everyone shares this opinion so I will advise that if this is a big selling point or factor for you then do not purchase the sets.  Being that we are talking about Paramount and Friday the 13th it is not likely that there will ever be a Blu-ray release or a spiffed up edition of the show.  This is it.

If you enjoy 80's movies/TV and like horror and anthology style shows then this should be an ace-in-the-hole for you!  Happy watching.  :D",1421625600,2,2568,4.235655737704918

They're is still a few great episodes in it but more often than not they aren't what you've come to expect from having watched the first 2. The first 2 seasons you can watch on a loop.

I was surprised about the number of discs. each season has about 5-6 discs. Season 3 has the shortest amount of episodes with 19. The continuity is great. It isn't a bunch of random travel here, travel there kind of thing. it all ties together and goes back to original story lines, which I love in a show. I just wish there was more of it. I would recommend this to anyone! Easy 5 stars for me.",1415750400,4,886,4.211764705882353

Yes it's super dated and super 80's looking, but a lot of the episodes are so amazing that it doesn't matter. My favorite is Vanity's Mirror - such a classic! There's creepy dolls, deadly smoking pipes, slicing violin bows, pocket watches that stop time, bees that help humans switch bodies...you name it, this TV show's got it! Sure it's ridiculous, but it's also highly entertaining and easy to get hooked on. Robey perfectly embodies the late-80's, but the all-knowing Jack is my favorite character.

3922119,5,B002FLOTPO,"I used to watch this show as a kid. It was one of my favorite shows. Unlike some other people I never thought the show was cheesy. I started watching the series again as an adult about 4 years ago when ME-TV Chicago started airing it. I hadn't seen the show for about 20 years  because I didn't have cable to watch it on SCIFI channel. Surpisingly I like the show even better now than I did as a kid. Part of the appeal of the show is the fond memories I have of watching it when I was very young, but as as an adult I have a better understanding of some of the episodes. This was a well-written show with interesting storylines and interesting background about the cursed objects, especially the background of the cradle in ""What a mother wouldn't do."" I don't mind that the special effects were minimal and other than a few minor things the show isn't anywhere near as dated as I thought it would be. Certain episodes really have me thinking about things that flew over my head as a kid. For example, the episode ""Crippled inside"" from season 3 had me thinking about issues such as right vs wrong, an eye for an eye, losing ones soul, revenge, and morals more than any episode. As for the music on this show some viewers thought it was bad. I think the music is cool and is one of the things I like best about the show. I wish the show would have been on the air more than 3 years. It was different than other horror shows during its time and anything on the air today. I also liked the 3 main stars. They had great chemistry. I didn't like Johnny as much as Ryan, but he was better than I remembered. Anybody who complains about the acting on this show just take a look at the acting from some movie stars who earn $20 million per movie. I thought most of the actors on this show were pretty good, particularly Neil Munro, Denis Forest, and Tom McCamus.",1407628800,3,1856,4.228169014084507

I enjoyed every episode as each cursed object in possession of someone benefitted them to a degree but its curse oftentimes required the life of another in payment of its use. The regular cast of actors are excellent in their roles. The episodes are injected with a side of humor at times and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them back when they originally aired in 1987 to 1990. I highly recommend to those who are horror movie fans to get these, you won't be disappointed!!!!!! It is a 3 season series pack, reasonably priced.",1399766400,2,799,4.673758865248227

3922144,5,B002FLOTPO,"I have watched most of these episodes recently after not seeing them at all for many years.  With out any shadow of a doubt the great and sexy Louise Robey (One night in Bangkok-song) was the star of this series, with Mr. Chris Wiggins offering a great support character role of the older but still heroic and intellectually scholarly ""Jack Marshack"", ready to defend the forces of man's good side against the other worldly demonic forces of evil. The ""Jack"" character brings maturity and validity to the series.  One episode we find out he fought in the Canadian Army in WW2 against a Nazi thug who had demonic powers, where a personal (Captain Kirk vs Khan - Luke vs. Darth Vader) style duel ensues which had been a good plot element to bring into the series.  This good guy character has a friend who shows up occasionally in the show as an interesting Egyptian wizard mystic guy who helps Louise Robey.

  Everything about this show reminds me of how much I loved the 80's, and it brings back so many memories of my childhood years.  This show has nothing to do with that terrible horror series where the slasher chases women with big boobies then chops up their boyfriends in the woods (Michael Myers or Jason?? Who ever he was.) & no matter WHAT the teenagers do they can never kill the guy!  Those films were so BAD! Lol

 This is a more slightly lighter but still scary and ghostly bizarre adventure show about two young heroes and Chris Wiggins trying to save the world from Satanic objects that must be obtained and stored in a special vault.  One of the Sci Fi channel's shows copied this exact plot some years later, but this 80's original was the best with the beautiful and sexy Robey.",1398643200,2,1699,4.537704918032787

Also this was in no way connected to the Friday the 13th the movie franchise which puts a whole new spin on the Friday the 13th were items are cursed by the devil and bad things happen , and this is the trend setter for the series warehouse 13 which copyied similar plots and had to get the objects back that were cursed .

3922182,5,B002FLOTPO,"I have started to watch all the episodes of Friday the 13th, the series again since the show went off the air about 23 years ago (as of writing this review). In a typical episode, the trio of Ryan, Micki and Jack try and retrieve a cursed item sold from the antique store they inherited. The cursed items are indestructible, so they are placed in a vault below the store for safe keeping.

  There are a lot of great episodes but if I had to pick my favorite one, I'd say ""Wedding in Black."" Technically there wasn't a cursed item in that episode which would help explain why the Snow Globe broke. Cursed items normally required a human sacrifice in a specific way to receive a benefit which had a theme related to the item.

  Most people who used the cursed items met unfortunate ends. A lot of the time revenge or greed fueled the use of the cursed items. Some of the episodes brought up the ethical question of whether it was ever right to use a cursed item. Would it be right, for example, to use a cursed item for revenge against those who tried to rape you and were responsible for you being completely paralyzed? There were even a couple of times where the trio tricked the bad guy into using the cursed item to help them out or used the cursed item themselves.

So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing.

3922214,5,B002FLOTPO,"I was torn between giving this DVD collection 4 or 5 Stars. This TV show probably won't meet the standards and expectations of many, but I figure anyone who is seriously considering this item for purchase is likely already familiar with Friday The 13th The Series. The show is over 20 years old... it is what it is... in terms of quality and value, I feel it's worthy of a good solid and fair 5 Star Rating. I'll just make a few additional comments.

Currently Amazon's price tag on this item is $90.99 (a savings of $11.48 over buying the 3 seasons individually). It's really not a bad price for 72 episodes (17 disks). One thing you should know is this is NOT a fancy boxed set. There is no collector/storage box or extra DVD full of special features. All this is are the show's 3 individual complete season boxed DVDs, all taped together and sold as a ""pack"".

As for the show itself, it's practically timeless! Yes, the special effects are cheesy, the story lines are a bit corny... but the show was from 1987-1990. I was in Junior High during that time, and used to watch it with my grandmother, so for me there is a certain sentimental value in watching these episodes again. Oddly enough the show doesn't really seem ""dated"", EXCEPT for a few minor, but distracting things: All the casual smoking. The lack of cell phones. And the music was TERRIBLE (mostly because they didn't pay for the rights to any commercially popular music... you get what you pay for, and in this case, it's crap).

It's been fun watching the episodes in the order they were broadcast because there is a very subtle sense of continuity with the back story of the characters from episode to episode. This is something I never really picked up on before as the show was syndicated, and many of the episodes I caught in re-runs. Also, I never fully understood the transition from Ryan to Johnny at the end of season 2 and start of season 3. Now I get it! It's easy to see how Friday The 13th The Series didn't survive season 3. As effect technology slowly improved, the stories didn't. It lost its charm... BUT, it was good while it lasted, and I have no regrets at all in spending nearly a hundred bucks on this set.",1280534400,130,2196,4.45771144278607

3922216,4,B002FLOTPO,"Let there be no confusion for those who have never seen this show.  This series has nothing to do with the Friday the 13th films.  It is about an antique shop who's devil dealing dealer sold evil cursed objects that have to be recovered by his niece & nephew; along with an old friend who also studied the occult.

  Just finishing the First Season of this 80's classic.  The special effects are very cheesy & low budget.  At the same time though it is great due to equally cheesy acting by Robey (the red head).  I really enjoyed this show when it was originally on.  The title honestly is what grabbed the attention, but once you began watching it you could not stop.  You were & still are hooked.

  The Sci-Fi Channel has been playing re-runs of this for some time now.  This was the only way to really watch it.  Luckily we now have it on DVD.  The quality of picture is not the greatest, but it does not become a distraction when viewing.  The sound is about the same.  The music score is exactly the same thankfully.  The First Season of HUNTER was recently purchased & they changed the majority of the back ground tunes.  All of the 80's classics are gone.  The regular score though is still intact. It is surprisingly graphic at times for a television show from the 80's.  It is common place now, but for back then this was pretty hard core.  Honestly though, the first few episodes were a little dry, but it picked up immediately after.  The evil doll episode is still great.

  If you were a fan originally when this show first came out then it would be a good idea to purchase this set.  It still holds up even as an adult watching it.  Get it on sale while you can.  Amazon has it pretty cheap compared to other sites.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-The-Series-Complete-Series-Pack/dp/B002FLOTPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th: The Series - Complete Series Pack</a>",1271203200,46,1950,4.803625377643504

8369127,5,B002FLOTPO,"FRIDAY THE 13TH was produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., the same guy who brought us the notorious slasher films of the same name, so you could be forgiven if you thought this was a biopic of Jason Voorhees set in Crystal Lake. Actually it has nothing to do with the hockey-masked killer, but is an entirely different story, albeit very much in the horror vein. The reasons for this are complicated but boil down to the fact that Paramount wanted to trade in on the ""Friday the 13th"" name, but Mancuso had too much integrity to look the other way while some abysmal ""Jason"" TV series was churned out. So a compromise was reached: the ""Friday"" name would be used, and the horror theme be retained, but Mancuso would develop an entirely different concept. Here it is:

Lewis Vendredi (R.G. Armstrong) made a pact with the devil. In return for wealth and immortality, he agreed to sell to the unwary customers of his antique shop items which had been cursed by Satan. When Vendredi tried to go back on the pact, he is sent to hell and the shop was left to his niece Micki Foster (Louise Robey), and her cousin by marriage Ryan Dallion (John D. LeMay). The two clueless relations are quickly educated as the true nature of the store's stock by a former business partner of Vandredi's named Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins), who had no idea the items he was selling Lewis were being used in such an evil manner until it was too late. Renaming the shop Curious Goods, the three of them set out to recover each of the more than 200 cursed items in circulation and place them in safekeeping in a special Vault so that they can do no more damage. This is easier said than done, of course, as each object carries a different curse -- and therefore a different danger.

I should probably start by addressing the show's three principal faults to get them out of the way. First, and especially during the early episodes of the first season, the budget for F13 was obviously pretty low, which affected every aspect of the production, an affect heightened for the modern viewer by the now horribly-dated special effects. Second, also most notably in the early going, the acting and writing are wildly inconsistent, with Robey tending to over-emote and DeMay tending to deliver the nervous, uncertain performance of a young actor out of his depth. Last, the style in which the series is executed is very portentous, with a lot of awkward moments: weak cliffhangers, bad jokes, and cheesy melodrama. When the show is bad, it's very bad indeed -- and I ought to add that the first episode of the second season, ""Doorway to Hell,"" is an embarrassing clunker which showcases all of these failings. And I'm not entirely sure I can forgive the departure of John D. LeMay at the beginning of Season Three; though Steve Monarque does his level best as latecomer-to-the-gang Johnny Ventura, I thought the character poorly written and rather unformed.

Having said that, this is a series that gleefully transcends its faults, and not merely because as the seasons wore on, the budget clearly increased -- even to the point of getting David Cronenberg as a guest director. Yes, many of the flaws were ironed out, and the episodes in the later seasons had flashy cinematography, better character actors for backup, and an ambitiously large scope; but the reason I found it so compulsively watchable was because it foreshadowed many of the characteristics which were to make shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, SUPERNATURAL and FRINGE so popular in later years. It combines surprisingly bloody and gruesome horror with sharp and seditious wit, while utilizing a family-style dynamic among the cast, and backing up a good-size truck of sexual tension in the bargain. Jack is the wise but somewhat enigmatic father-figure with the shadowy past; Micki is surefooted and responsible but restraining great passions; Ryan is the immature slacker coming to grips with manhood and destiny. (Later, in the third season, Johnny is the ""step son"" trying to find his place in the pre-existing family.)
Together they produce that chemistry and likeability that ever show strives for but very few achieve. Just as importantly, this is a horror show that really delivers the goods. The curses are full of terrible irony, the villains diverse in their villainy, and the killings are grisly and, considering the time period, extremely graphic and long-winded: you'll see people burned alive, electrocuted, riddled with bullets, stabbed, impaled, beheaded, set on fire, fed into wood chippers, and in one case, drowned in a toilet. What's more, FRIDAY was a not a series which was afraid of unhappy endings. Some of the quests were less successful than others, and as the seasons wore on, each of the characters suffered terrible, personal losses which made them question whether they wanted to continue fighting the good fight.

Some of the best episodes in the series:

""Eye of Death"" - An unscrupulous collector is using a cursed object to travel back and forth from the era of the Civil War to steal priceless antiquities.

""The Mephisto Ring"" - Yet another story featuring the excellent character actor Denis Forest, who made many appearances on the show; this one puts a degenerate gambler in hock to the mob in possession of a cursed ring that foresees the outcome of sports events.

""The Butcher"" - Chris Wiggins gets to do all the heavy lifting in this episode that pits Jack Marshak against a resurrected Nazi war criminal he killed in the waning days of WW2.

""Mesmer's Bauble"" - 1980s pop-siren Vanity guest stars in an episode with an obsessed fan whose cursed object, a pendant, allows him to get very close to her...so close you might not be able to tell them apart.

""The Maestro"" -- The first appearance by coldly competent Colm Fiore in this series (he returns in Season Three's excellent ""Mightier Than The Sword"") is a fascinating story about a crippled dance master whose cursed music box literally causes people to ""dance 'til they drop."" Dead.

""A Cup of Time"" -- A female rock star uses a cursed cup to remain young. Nice twists in this plot, as well as some great 80s rock 'n roll ""fashion.""

""Doctor Jack"" -- A wonderfully atmospheric episode about a mediocre doctor who obtains Jack the Ripper's scalpel and becomes a world-class surgeon, the catch being that the scalpel must be ""fed"" with a murder after every operation.

""Scarecrow"" -- The gang tackles a woman whose scarecrow promises a superb harvest...provided it gets to collect three heads per growing season.

""Symphony in B#"" -- One of the tightest, most beautifully shot stories revolves around a cursed violin, a beautiful violinist, and Ryan's romantic interest in same.

""Faith Healer"" -- directed by David Cronenberg, this one features a glove which can transfer disease or injury from one person to another: a startlingly brutal episode with some very Cronenberg-like gore.

""Vanity's Mirror"" -- A cursed compact gives a homely, bitter high school girl an opportunity to get even with her tormentors and snag the man of her dreams: her sister's boyfriend.

""The Pirate's Promise"" - Taking a page out of THE FOG, this one involves a cursed foghorn, the ghost of a pirate, and a hit list 200 years old.

""Demon Hunter"" - A family of demon-hunters tracks a vicious hellspawn right to Curious Goods, where they naturally assume any house with a vault full of cursed objects sitting atop a gateway to hell must be run by some very wicked people. An action-packed episode with some effective twists, plenty of gruesome horror and even some backstory about Vendredi's shop.

""Crippled Inside"" -- A girl flees a gang-rape attempt only to be hit by a car end up a quadraplegic. A cursed wheelchair gives her back use of her body, one dead rapist at a time. One of the series' best episodes, and very much a showcase for Steve Monarque, this one has everything: horror, revenge, wrenching moral dilemmas, and even the surprising appearance of a man who was very grateful he bought from Louis Vendredi.

""Femme Fatale"" - A washed-up film director living with his elderly, invalid actress wife uses a cursed film to bring a sexy young version of his bride into reality. The cost? One dead young girl for every viewing. A terrific story with a clever premise and a moving finish.

""The Charnel Pit"" -- The show's last episode is a fitting farewell to the series. A serial killer is feeding unsuspecting women into a cursed painting which sucks them 200 years back through time into Revolutionary France, where the bloodthirsty Marquis de Sade awaits them. When Micki meets this fate, Jack and Johnny must save her. But does she want to be saved from the charismatic sadist?

Now, to really enjoy F13, one must remember that it was shot between 1997 - 1990 and is very ""dated"" in many ways, and often cheesy; also that the storylines are very dark and sometimes terribly depressing: happy endings are few and far between. But damn, it's so much fun, and delivers a healthy dose of 80s-90s nostalgia as well. Simply put, this particular hell is a very fine place to be.",1523145600,,9112,4.809584664536741
