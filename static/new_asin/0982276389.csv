It is an incredible hands on resource that we will utilize till our children go to college.

There is so much to say about it I don't know where to begin but the most useful are the monthly charts of which character traits to instill in what months, with sub categories of topics to work on each week. Fun examples and role playing examples included. Love proactive parenting! It we can teach our children proactively there will be nothing we can't handle and we won't react!!!!",1388188800,,555,4.653061224489796
