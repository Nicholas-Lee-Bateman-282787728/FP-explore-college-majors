7328876,2,B0117ASVHU,"There is lot of gossip and nastiness in any business - and that includes show business - likely, at the top of the list. And while I enjoyed some of what was relayed here, it was all sort of unnecessary. I mean, Roddenberry was a hero. And deserves so much respect. His flaws - big and small - are sort of irrelevant in context. I did laugh a few times and liked a few of the stories but the entire presentation is not really fair to those who are dead and can't speak for themselves. Moreover, did Roddenberry really deserve a kick to the groin from all of these folks whose careers he made possible. Not very impressive. And while I love Shatner, I think he could have done a better job than this although I'm sure that the ""fans"" will love to hear the dirt that went on behind the scenes.",1455148800,,791,4.2105263157894735
7328877,5,B0117ASVHU,"Most people know William Shatner as the dashing and sometimes stilted captain James T. Kirk or Denny Crane from Boston Legal. What they may not know is that the man has carved out a fascinating niche for himself since the early '90s as memoirist and documentarian. Usually focused on Star Trek, you can rest assured that if you see a project with Shatner's name attached to it the end product is going to be insightful and, to quote a certain green-blooded pointy-eared goblin we all know and love, fascinating.

Chaos on the Bridge doesn't disappoint. Many agree that TNG didn't hit its stride until about three seasons in. Some know bits and pieces of the contentious back story and the fights with Roddenberry over his idealized version of Trek and what made interesting television. What this documentary does is bring together the larger than life personalities that were involved in that process and presents it in a compelling and surprisingly frank manner.

This is definitely no Hollywood puff piece where actors and creators are blowing smoke up each other's asses and talking about how great everything was. The creative process is laid bare, warts and all. No one is spared and often conflicting narratives are presented on top of one another to show the interesting way that the past can change in people's minds after thirty years.

Even if you're not a fan of Trek this is an excellent documentary and interesting glimpse into the process of making television. Highly recommended.",1448928000,7,1494,4.944223107569721
7328878,4,B0117ASVHU,"Really surprisingly good background story on the creation of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but really with a focus entirely on the struggle for power and the conflicting visions of those involved, particularly in the first 3 seasons. Shatner does a fine job of bringing the story and keeps his own story and personality subdued. I enjoyed this hour.",1448582400,,351,4.966101694915254

7328880,5,B0117ASVHU,"Superb. Shatner's idea to focus on the power struggles surrounding the production of STNG is incredibly smart, and makes this documentary not just another redundant take on Star Trek but something interesting and worthwhile in itself. The candid points of view about Rodenberry are also refreshing. The lauds are there too, but this is a more honest take on his legend.",1447891200,8,369,5.065573770491803

7328882,5,B0117ASVHU,"This is a documentary about the early years of Star Trek:TNG. It is a somewhat short documentary, but is filled with quite a bit of information that is presented in such a way that will probably have you rethinking how important or unimportant Gene Roddenberry was to the Star Trek franchise as it came to be more modernized. The documentary is mostly about Roddenberry, the struggles of the first season of TNG, the chaotic second season, and why after season two the series needed to change from story driven to character driven. In my opinion this is the best Trek documentary since Trekkies.",1444176000,12,595,4.786407766990291

Great interviews with all sorts of people: Maurice Hurley, D.C. Fontana, David Gerrold, Patrick Stewart, Michael Okuda, Brannon Braga, Ron Moore. Very interesting, very candid, and very insightful.

8723706,5,B0117ASVHU,"William Shatner's hilarious, fast-paced documentary ""Chaos On The Bridge"" leaves the impression that getting ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" on the air weekly for its first two years was a cosmic miracle.

In ""TNG,"" creator Gene Roddenberry envisioned a 24th century in which humans have evolved beyond interpersonal conflict. Yet this vision was being produced in an atmosphere of constant conflict and struggles for power. Shatner makes the irony crystal clear, yet doesn't hammer the viewer over her head with it.

At the outset, Shatner presents Roddenberry as a man trying to take his creation back after a post-Original Series career of failed TV pilot films and the indignity of being sidelined from the film series after the out-of-control production of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" In addition, Roddenberry was also suffering from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.

While Roddenberry was trying to get clean and sober, his attorney, Leonard Maizlish, negotiated with Paramount a sizable compensation package for both himself and his client. Soon, the lawyer who wasn't a writer, and hence not a Writers' Guild member, was acting as ""bad cop"" to Roddenberry's ""good cop,"" much to the chagrin of TOS veterans Dorothy Fontana and David Gerrold, and everyone else working on the new series. Maizlish rewrote scripts in Roddenberry's name and passed off his script notes to writers as Roddenberry's. (In a hilarious animated sequence, Gerrold imagines shoving Maizlish out an open office window to doom on the concrete far below.) Even after Paramount banished him from the lot, Maizlish sneaked into the production offices and broke into writers' computers to view their work-which Fontana called ""chutzpah.""

Things became so bad, we learn, that a memorial writers' wall was created in honor of the writers and producers who left due to not only Maizlish's meddling, but also struggles with Roddenberry's utopian vision of the future-which writer/producer Maurice Hurley calls ""wacky doodle""-which writers felt stifled their ability to create drama. (Hurley's description also inspired a hilarious, same-titled country/western pastiche which plays over the film's closing credits, and which must be heard to be believed. Words cannot do it justice.)

The power struggles even crept onto the stage, claiming actor Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher), who was fired at the first season's end for apparently being too outspoken, a trait she developed both in academia and on the stage. Enter Original Series veteran Diana Muldaur, who lasted only one season because her Dr. Katherine Pulaski never gelled with the remaining cast, who missed McFadden.

Hurley survived those first-season power struggles to run ""TNG"" during its second season, but left at its end after wearying of constant battle with Roddenberry over scripts and concluding that the ""Great Bird of the Galaxy"" was a cuckoo bird.

Shatner uses his position within the franchise to assemble a convention's worth of personalities including actors, writers, producers and Paramount production executives to tell their stories of TNG's troubled early years. He also breaks up what could have been nothing more than a parade of talking heads with animated sequences such as the one described above to not only provide visual interest, but also add even more humor. (A brief scene of an airplane trailing what's supposed to be Patrick Stewart's toupee in its wake is another gem.)

Since this film's about ""TNG,"" Shatner stays out of the narrative and lets his interview subjects speak at length about their experiences-the sole exception coming when he's asked about his reaction to a ""Trek"" series without Captain James T. Kirk in the command chair.

Much of the material is well-known to ""Trek"" fans, but two stories were new to me: Denise Crosby (Lt. Tasha Yar) describing sneaking over to the ""Cheers"" set to steal food because ""TNG"" had no craft services budget, and Stewart angrily absenting himself from a cast interview on ""Good Morning America"" because the weatherman was wearing his costume.

This is a strong behind-the-scenes hour. And to learn more about this tumultuous period, I recommend purchasing Joel Engel's biography, ""Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and The Man Behind Star Trek"" in concert with this DVD.",1508716800,4,4297,5.287390029325513

8723712,5,B0117ASVHU,"Already adored by Star Trek fans for his iconic portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk, William Shatners latest role in Gene Roddenberrys Wagon Train to the Stars is occurring on the other side of the camera, as a documentarian of the shows success and enduring legacy. Shatners latest effort focuses on the tumultuous first seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) in William Shatner Presents Chaos From the Bridge, streaming exclusively on vimeo.com.

The first and second seasons of Next Generation are almost unwatchable in all honesty, former TNG writer and producer Ron Moore explained during the documentary. The fan base kept the show on the air through those first two rocky years.

Shatner reveals just how tempestuous those early seasons were in Chaos, as Paramount and Roddenberry played hands of high-stakes poker and engaged in an epic power struggle that could rival any Federation-Klingon battle. Things were so bad behind-the-scenes, it had impacted the ability of the actors to bring their characters to life, and resulted in the departure of Denise Crosby and Patrick Stewart threatened of having his character written off the show.

Considering TNG went through 30-plus writers in its first season alone (Moore reveals he had a wall in his office restroom with the names of all the shows writers from the first two seasons), it is truly amazing that the fans remained faithful through those first few years.

Interviewing former TNG actors, writers, producers and Rick Berman, who guided the franchise during Roddenberrys declining health and after his death, Shatner sits down with the people who were directly involved in producing the weekly telecast (which Shatner noted as of today, is still the only syndicated show ever nominated for an Emmy as Best Outstanding Drama Series).

As he has in his previous Star Trek documentaries, Shatner allows the people involved to write the story. These interviews inform his sense of storytelling, while his interviewing style in Chaos allows fans to learn of the machiavellian schemes that happened during TNGs production. Despite the quest for personal power, last-minute script rewrites by Roddenberry, as well as his insistence on no conflict among the members of the Enterprise crew, it is truly miraculous to think how easily Star Trek could have ended back in the late 1980s.

Closing in next year on its 50th anniversary, its easy to forget there was a time when Star Trek was actually considered a failure. The Original Series had to be saved twice by fans in its initial run, and a third letter-writing campaign was not enough to bring it back for a fourth season.

Syndication and the convention circuit revived the first, true television cult phenomenon, resulting in 1979s Star Trek The Motion Picture and 10 subsequent feature films, as well as four more television series. However, Roddenberrys legacy was anything but guaranteed when Paramount approached him in 1986 regarding development of a new Star Trek television show, a project which fans initially rebelled against because it did not include their beloved characters.

This time, despite the Great, Big Bird of the Galaxy, Star Treks legacy not only endured, but has continued to thrive 27 years later.",1467676800,,3243,5.140417457305503
