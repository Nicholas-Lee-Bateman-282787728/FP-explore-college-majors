I guess we can expect an official release in the next few months.
Apparently it will be a DVD-R without subtitles.

Hard to believe, but in the 1940s, author Brett Halliday outsold both Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett as a writer of detective fiction.
Wise-cracking Private Eye Michael Shayne was featured in 69 novels published between 1939 and 1977.
Between 1940 and 1942, Twentieth Century Fox released seven films starring Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne.

The final film in the series, ""Time to Kill"" may be the most interesting.
It was actually adapted from a Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe novel (""The High Window""), two years before Marlowe debuted on film under his own name (in ""Murder My Sweet"", 1944).
""The High Window"" was filmed again in 1947.
This time retitled ""The Brasher Doubloon"", starring George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brasher-Doubloon/dp/B00AB2NX4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brasher Doubloon</a>
Spoiler alert: The surprise endings of ""Time to Kill"" and ""The Brasher Doubloon"" are identical.

I have a fantasy where the major studios take great care to release their old movies on DVD (even B-Movies).
The dream started to come true back in 2007 when Fox Home Video released the ""Michael Shayne Mystery Collection, Volume One"".
But it was not to be.
There never was a Volume Two.
Instead Fox released the remaining three films in dribs and drabs.

Back in 2007, four of the seven films were packaged in a two DVD boxed set.
All films had subtitles, and the box included several interesting featurettes about Michael Shayne.

I have been patiently waiting for Volume Two, but it is not to be.
Instead we have had to buy individual DVDs of:

not to be confused with the 1946 Sherlock Holmes movie of the same title

**** ""Time to Kill"" REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE (DVD-R, no subtitles)

The seven Lloyd Nolan movies were produced by Twentieth Century Fox's B-Movie division
The Fox series ended in 1942, but four years later it was revived by PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) for a series of five films with Hugh Beaumont (better known as Beaver Cleaver's father).
PRC was strictly Poverty Row.
Even Monogram looked down on PRC.
The Lloyd Nolan movies are great fun, and even the Hugh Beaumont PRC films are not without their charms.
You just have to like B-Movies.
Only one of the five Hugh Beaumont films is available on DVD.

HUGH BEAUMONT AS MICHAEL SHAYNE:
1946: Murder Is My Business
1946: Larceny in Her Heart
1946: Blonde for a Day =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blonde-for-a-Day/dp/B0081LCRJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blonde for a Day</a>
