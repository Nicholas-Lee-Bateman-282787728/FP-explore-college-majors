Although I am not a Chinese speaker, I always chose Mandarin because I love the way it sounds. Thankfully, the series does offer English subtitles. Although there are some grammatical and spelling mistakes, I consider these to be minor and do not detract from the viewer's enjoyment of the dialogue, which can be very poetic and beautiful at times.

As the professional review describes, the story centers on Zhang Xiao a present day young woman from Beijing who through an accident, finds herself in a previous incarnation. Her soul is transported to the Qing Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Xangxi, in the body of Maertai Ruoxi, (Roussi), a young noblewoman of that era. As Roussi gets over the shock of her circumstances, she begins to adapt to the Qing Dynasty period and meets and befriends those sons of the Emperor who are most prominent in the war of succession. Roussi falls in love with two of these princes.
Which one becomes the love of her life? You have to see the series to find out. Our protagonist finds herself right smack in the middle of the conflict, yearning to change history. The story is well researched, so are the costumes and sets and the scenes of the Forbidden City are just breathtaking. If you are not familiar with the Reigns of the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors, you will learn a lot about the customs, mores, and politics through our Maertai Ruoxi. The plots and subplots are wonderful and you will be glued to your DVD players from start to finish. In my opinion, the series is worth every penny and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection",1438646400,,1707,4.652317880794702

The story is lovely and easy to follow even with not so great subtitles. When buying these dramas it is advisable that you check which players can be used, Amazon and sellers make it their business to let
customers know what devices to use . I for one appreciate this attention to detail when product is advertised. Being a collecttor of many of these dramas I am grateful to Amazon and the sellers it has for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this form of learning entertainment.",1423094400,,624,4.473684210526316

I loan it to my friend but it will not play on any of her DVD player at her house and even in her Laptop it will not play.  I love the movie but it is where you will have to play it is disappointing.  It played well in my DVD which is blu-ray but my friend has the same DVD as mind but would not play.",1393977600,,471,3.69
