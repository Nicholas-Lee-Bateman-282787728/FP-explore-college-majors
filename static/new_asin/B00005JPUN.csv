I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.

Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a ""glorified zombie movie"" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a ""Zombie"" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected. That said however, there is just something about the way they move, the way they don't require nourishment, and just walk around mindlessly infecting others with their alien virus that makes them very zombie like.

Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. we start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. Their smiling too much, their too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. at first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.

The real horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.

And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for out aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and infected.

The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.  if you read this review, please leave a comment.

EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near as good as the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.

Replay value; high.",1191283200,3,4709,5.252659574468085
1584232,1,B00005JPUN,"Where to begin...

When I sat down in the theater I thought this would be GOOD, though it Began with a scene from about halfway through the movie and backtracked.

It begins very well, with the space shuttle coming down the hard way and bringing some uninvited guests with it. I Also liked the idea of the gender reversal of the roles from the original.

Then...

I am going to give away a plot point here, so if you are desperate to see this film (Uhm IF that is the case, then maybe You ought to get out more) stop reading now.

Spoiler Alert:

The reason they call this one ""The Invasion""?

No ""Body Snatching"" ever really takes place!

Yesiree! What we have here friends is the Wimpifying of the SF/Horror culture (Much like Spiderman 2...) ""Invasion"" it is, without a pod person in sight, they ""infect"" you by vomiting into your drinks (among other things) and worse, due to the current ""I like Everybody, don't you all like me"" vibe going through most movies, the ""invasion"" is treated like a (n easily cured) virus - making it possible to reach the end and have (almost) everyone ""Invaded"" be all honky-dorey.

Suffice it to say, I felt cheated... If they Had to do it this way they could easily have gone back to the first movie or the book for a more upbeat ending.

Get any one of the first three.

This one, - pay Me and Maybe I'll take it off your hands for you.",1191196800,6,1374,4.328125
1584233,3,B00005JPUN,"THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF REVIEW FOR ME!!!

Had I seen THE INVASION at another time in life, I might have been willing to poo-poo it and move on; but having just returned from a vacation that took me into areas of the country where ""same mindset thinking' is so predominate where people act and think identically, I viewed THE INVASION through a much different lens. I was actually in areas where people think so much alike and are so outwardly ""charming"" and ""hospitable"" that they are willing to blow everyone else to Hell (and NOT back!) in order to have everyone thinking, acting and being like they are. I thought this was a great contrast to what THE INVASION postulates that world peace was possible through control of the individual.

I didnot find this THE INVASION to be a great film at all. I thought that the likes of Northam,Craig and Kidman were so much more worthy of better material, but hey, they need to work! Having seen all of the other versions of this story,to me, this was just an alternative presentation of the ""same ol'-same-ol'"" with a different style. Nothing wrong with that. (It was filmed in my hometown for over two years and snarled downtown traffic everyday.) But, that said,when I can walk away from a ""zombie film"" (I cannot think of a better term),with something that sticks in my crawl, then I am pleased that my time was well spent. Something that I have learned the hard way I will continue to take with me through life: I will NOT let anything or anyone control the way I think. LONG LIVE THE INDIVIDUAL!",1188604800,2,1547,4.541218637992832
1584234,2,B00005JPUN,"""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".... Er, ""The Invasion"", the second remake of the popular, iconic Science Fiction film, is not a bad film. It is just a very familiar film. It does manage to create some good thrills and it sets the story against the backdrop of our current political climate in an unusual way, giving it a little more interest than the tired material has any right to generate.

A shuttle burns up upon reentry causing debris to land across a wide swath of the United States. Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), a member of the CDC, visits one of the crash sites and gets a cut on his hand. Dr. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) notices people starting to act strange and turns to her best friend, Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig). He takes a small sample of the material to a friend of his, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) and they soon learn the substance is not of this Earth. Carol's son, Oliver (Jackson Bond) is also having nightmares and Carol thinks it is because he is about to start spending time with his father, Tucker, who has recently returned from Atlanta. But Tucker is one of the first infected and starts acting weird, showing little emotion. One of Carol's patients (Veronica Cartwright, who appeared in the 1978 version of the film) complains that her husband is acting differently; they no longer fight and she claims he is no longer her husband. As she begins to voice these concerns, Carol begins to notice other strange things; people are staring at her as she walks by, no one shows any emotion when a car hits a woman. Carol soon realizes she must stay awake, find her son, and join her two friends as they try to get to Fort Dix and work on an antidote.

Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel (""Downfall""), with an apparent assist from the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy, more on that later), ""The Invasion"" does a fairly good job of setting up the story; the shuttle explosion allows the wreckage to land in a wide area covering approximately 200 miles, exposing millions to the infection. The alien material is on the pieces of the shuttle and as soon as someone touches a piece of the wreckage, they become infected. Naturally, they then infect others. And so on and so forth. As these infected people become more prominent, they become bolder and take less precaution in the next stages of their plans. When they become more prominent, become the majority, they have no reason to try to cover up and simply start grabbing people off the street.

The director does a good job of setting up Carol's universe and using that as an indicator of the state of the Invasion. One day, as Carol walks into her office building, she notices certain things, the next day, they are different. But we get the idea that she is used to the things she noticed in the first way, so when they are different, even though they don't appear that different, she notices. And they seem strange to her, startling her, causing her to start to look at everything with new, critical eyes.

""The Invasion"" borrows many of the key elements that made the first two films so successful. And they continue to work in this new version. In order to move among the infected undetected, Carol learns she must show no emotion. So, as she walks through large crowds, and they watch a couple commit suicide, a woman standing near Carol screams at the sight. As Carol moves away, the infected round up the emotional woman and prepare to convert her.

There are nice touches included throughout. As Carol learns specific things about the invasion, these elements are used to create little moments of suspense only the audience knows about. Because we are in on the information, when the character in question is not, we feel a bigger part of the action. It is an old idea that Hitchcock perfected. Hirschbegel is no Hitchcock, but he gives it a game try.

""The Invasion"" is a film that should not have been released in the summer. Expectations are too high during this period and if any release doesn't make at least $50 million in its opening weekend, it is a flop, which is a crazy illustration of how excessive this industry has become. Apparently, someone decided the film was a little too low key for their liking and producer Joel Silver called in the Wachowski Brothers to do a rewrite and reshoot some scenes. From what I understand, they redid the car chases in the film. And they are impressively shot, but they don't really need to be that impressive for this film. ""The Invasion"" would be a much more successful film if it stuck to the task of building tension rather than orchestrating car chases. If ""The Invasion"" were released in the fall, it would probably have been able to maintain the original feel and tone. It might have been a much better film for it.

Nicole Kidman plays the Kevin McCarthy/ Donald Sutherland role. As psychiatrist Dr. Carol Bennell, she is a bit aloof and emotionally unattached to the rest of the characters. She is the type of mother who, because of her job, tries to interpret her son's nightmares. She also can't get too attached to Ben, because she can't lose her best friend. Really, she doesn't want to have the emotional attachment, and deal with the possibility of losing that. As she becomes enmeshed in the crisis, she makes smart decisions and stays just slightly ahead of the infected.

I find it odd that Nicole Kidman has almost made a career of playing emotionally unattached women. Every role she plays, with a few exceptions, is emotionally aloof, manipulative or conniving, or simply crazy and can't show any genuine emotion. In some of her films, this type of thing works. In others, it doesn't. This type of performance doesn't serve her particularly well in ""The Invasion""; it would be nice to see her show some emotion to offset those moments when she is unable to do so, trying to fly under the radar of the aliens.

Daniel Craig is a bit one-dimensional, little more than a sidekick to Carol. When she needs muscle, he provides it. When she needs something, he is there to provide it. He is even unable to provide her with the medical information she needs; he has to take that to a friend of his, for analysis. It seems strange that they didn't make him a different type of doctor and allow him to provide this important piece of the puzzle. As it is, he is simply Carol's frustrated boy toy.

Jeffrey Wright plays the doctor with the information about the infectious agent and Jeremy Northam plays Carol's ex-husband and the man who is largely responsible for spreading the invasion throughout the United States. And then the world. Both are good, but unspectacular and not very memorable.

Set in ""Present Day"", ""The Invasion"" shows the effect of the aliens taking over our minds and bodies giving the story a unique, timely slant. It is a nice touch, giving the film just a touch of political conscience and giving us just a bit of a political message.

""The Invasion"" has enough going for it that it would definitely make a suitable DVD rental. But it is such a familiar story and executed in a familiar way that you will not have enough surprises to warrant the time and money of a trip to the local multiplex.",1188172800,3,7188,4.642295597484277
1584235,1,B00005JPUN,"Where do I begin with this preachy, dumb film? Should I focus on the terrible acting? How about the lame dialog?  What about the pointless pontification at every level?  Or about the ridiculous ""tied up in a ribbon"" ending that defies belief?  The Invasion is the worst thing I've seen in a ""serious film"" since the dreadful remake of The Wicker Man. In fact, it's worse.  I was tempted almost continuously to leave the theater and demand my money back, but it was almost 90 degrees and humid outside. Stay for the air conditioning if you must, but not for this cinematic tripe.",1188000000,4,578,4.58252427184466
1584236,4,B00005JPUN,"There have been four film adaptations of Jack Finney's novel ""The Body Snatchers."" The first and most famous was Walter Wanger's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" released in 1956 and starring Kevin McCarthy. This was followed by Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake, after which came ""Body Snatchers,"" a spin off film released in 1993. Clearly, this story has gotten a lot of mileage, and if future filmmakers aren't careful, it's only going to wear itself out. This is why I was nervous about the latest adaptation, ""The Invasion""; I would be watching a completely unoriginal film with a predictable story. I went to the theater fully expecting to be disappointed. Then a funny thing happened--I got into it. And by the time I left, I realized that I actually enjoyed it.

""The Invasion"" is a rehash, but at the very least, it's a well-made rehash. This is a taut, suspenseful, creepy science fiction thriller that can put the audience in an uncomfortable place. All versions of this story play on our fears of identity loss, namely how humanity is gradually being replaced by an alien species. This new film adds an original twist; instead of clone-producing pods, a microscopic organism invades the body like a virus and reprograms the mind. In order for the transformation to occur, the infected person must fall asleep. The film opens with Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) in a trashed pharmacy. Dazed, frightened, and losing control, she searches for medications to keep her awake. Why this is happening, we don't yet know. All we do know is that, as she does this, something is trying to force its way through a locked door.

The film then flashes back to the events leading up to this scene. The invasion begins when a space shuttle breaks apart when reentering the atmosphere. Dozens of pieces land in various parts of the United States. As would be expected, many curious spectators try to take a small piece for themselves. What they don't know is that the hull of the shuttle is contaminated with some kind of organism; not long after the crash, people start to behave strangely, something that can only be attributed to a new strain of the flu. And it's rapidly spreading.

As all this is being established, Bennell is properly introduced as a divorced psychiatrist living in Washington, D.C. She begins to suspect something is wrong when her patient, Wendy Lenk (Veronica Cartwright, in an homage to her role in the 1978 film), confides that her husband is no longer her husband. He doesn't scream or hit, even when she does. He killed their dog. He always offers her something to drink. Such odd behavior is popping up all over the city, and pretty soon, random people stare at Bennell with blank yet horrifying expressions. Even her ex-husband, Tucker (Jeremy Northam), seems to have been affected. She rightfully feels nervous about letting her son, Oliver (Jackson Bond), stay with him, especially since he frequently wakes up screaming from fever-induced nightmares.

After a while, it becomes obvious that a full-blown pandemic has hit the nations of the world. Bennell seeks the help of Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), two doctors who might be able to isolate and define the virus. As they try to do their research, the infected are continuing to spread the alien virus, both by setting up phony inoculation centers and by vomiting on their victims. At this point, Bennell focuses solely on finding her son, who remains stuck with his transformed father. She knows Oliver is in terrible danger. What she has yet to discover is that, because of a childhood disease, Oliver may be the key to eradicating the alien virus.

In the midst of all this tension, the film takes an interesting turn by forcing us to question the true nature of the virus: Could it, in fact, be offering humanity the promise of peace? Is it worth losing our individuality if it means an end to war, violence, and hate? I have to admit; it sounds pretty tempting, considering the age we live in. The filmmakers seemed well aware of this, as seen during a news report announcing a peace agreement between North Korea and Iran. A welcome turn of events, no question. But at what cost? At one point, Bennell and a Russian diplomat engage in a very thought provoking conversation about the nature of humanity; history has shown that humans are aggressive in nature, and to lose that aggression is to lose all that is human. It isn't my place to agree or disagree with this line of reasoning. I will say that, if the diplomat is right, then we have some serious work to do.

The film's major weakness is its final thirty minutes, which was reportedly rewritten by the Wachowski Brothers and re-shot by director James McTeigue. Indeed, moments of ""The Invasion"" do seem tacked on and awkward, such as a couple of car chase sequences. Nonetheless, I was taken by the general direction of the story, and I give a lot of praise to credited director Oliver Hirschbiegel for crafting some genuinely frightening moments. In general, I liked this movie. Why, I'm not entirely sure; I'm usually the first to criticize a film for being unoriginal. But this time, I didn't really care.",1187654400,,5185,4.820224719101123
1584237,5,B00005JPUN,"First of all, I am not a big fan of re-makes.  Especially with all the mindless tripe contained in so many of the re-makes coming out today.  I think the two worst re-makes that have come out in just the past two years were ""War Of The Worlds"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes.""  Both of these re-makes did an absolute injustice to the originals and both of the original films contained a far better atmosphere, and acting as well.  I just don't understand the problem that Hollywood, along with people, in general, seem to have with original films.  Is newer necessarily better?
Well, that being said, I really have to say that this latest re-make of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is a rare exception to the re-make tripe that has been occurring recently and a marvelous breath of fresh air.  This was a very gripping and intelligent sci-fi thriller and I really felt that Nicole Kidman made one of her finest performances ever.  (I thought I was going to have insomnia after watching her brilliant perfomance of trying to stay awake to avoid becoming the latest victim of the invasion).

At any rate, this is one that should not be missed.  This has to be the best re-make since the other rarity, ""King Kong"", by Peter Jackson.",1187654400,4,1224,4.577981651376147
1584238,5,B00005JPUN,"After the show, we walked through the underground subways of Market Street here in San Francisco, electronic doors opening before us as we passed, and I said to my wife, ""Show no emotion, not even a quiver.""  The faces of passersby looked grim, agonized, emotional.  I was afraid for them, they'd be picked up next.  My wife said, ""OK then, even though the movie was sort of a mess it still unsettles you.""  And it's true.  The fourth version of Jack Finney's 50s sci-fi masterpiece is a little incoherent, but despite the reputed four directors it works on a basic level, it scares the dickens out of you!  Nicole Kidman plays a psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, in modernday Washington DC (attractive use of the city); a divorcee, Carol shares custody of her young son Oliver with her former husband, some kind of government bureaucrat in charge of health issues.  Tucker Kaufman, the husband, is played by Jeremy Northam and at first he doesn't seem like such a bad guy.  When the space shuttle ""Patriot"" returns from its mission in outer space and explodes in a two hundred mile wide corridor from Dallas to DC, the wreckage is isolated, and a random sample seems to show spores attached to it, spores that have somehow survived the intense cold of space and also the phenomenal heat of re-entry.  Once Tucker is accidentally handed a piece of spore-laden metal, you know things aren't going to go well for his dog, his ex-wife, nor his little boy, but that's why we paid the ten dollars after all!

German director Oliver Hirschbiegel is said to have been responsible for the quieter, more claustrophobic scenes in which, one by one, all of Carol's patients, friends and neighbors get ""changed"" somehow.  When she googles the phrase ""my husband is not my husband,"" hundreds of thousands of hits blink back at her.  In no time at all she ""gets it,"" aided by Hirschbiegel's nifty casting of Veronica Cartwright, from the Phil Kaufman version of BODY SNATCHERS, as the most over the top of Carol's patients, one afraid of her husband's volatile ways who gets even more afraid when he becomes ""snatched.""

The biggest change I could see was that--no pods are involved in this alien invasion--and also that some people might be immune to being invaded and thus more of a target than ever to the alien mass consciousness that seeks to find a new home on earth.  Both these changes made the story seem fresh and frisky, though actually I've liked all of the versions so far, even the one with Meg Tilly by Abel Ferrara from the 1990s.

Of course since the 1950s the back story has always seemed timely, and relevant to each era, and here you couldn't help but think of Nicole Kidman at the mercy of the Scientologists and her battle with her former husband, and how he Tom Cruise must be furious at her playing a psychiatrist in the first place, especially one quick to dispense Adderall and other psychoactive drugs at apparently a moment's notice.  A deliberate provocation on Nic's part?  Who knows what goes on in the mind of the great stars?  She and Daniel Craig share a nice chemistry that makes me look forward to their work together in THE GOLDEN COMPASS later this year; and in fact Daniel Craig works well together with Jeffrey Wright, don't you think?  They were good as Bond and Felix Leiter in CASINO ROYALE, and here they are back again as scientist pals.

All in all not a perfect movie but far better than its muddled reputation would have you think.  The theater we watched it in was filled with the sound of screams, the sound of hundreds of people having a good old time!",1187395200,4,3584,4.648177496038035

Very scary until it cops out at the end, with the human race tritely and miraculously saved.  As I recall, the 1956 original ends with no hope in sight and mankind apparently doomed.  Here the filmmakers didn't have the guts to wipe humanity out, 'for better or worse.'  Nevertheless, this remake has its pluses.  It does a good, skillful job incrementing the takeover, so that we can't even tell at what point the pods reach critical mass.  The best scenes are when the few remaining humans try to hide in plain sight from the pod people while sharing in passing whispers to uninfected strangers what they've figured out about the invasion (""don't show any emotion"" - ""don't go to sleep."")  These scenes were moving, sad, and scary add-ons to the '56 classic.

1584328,2,B00005JPUN,"This is really just a horrible movie of the week on a bigger budget. It takes real talent to 100% ruin TWO classic body snatcher films.

 How dumb is it?

- Other than one scene in a train bathroom, Nicole Kidman always looks like she's stepping out on the red carpet. I mean, she's been awake for 48 hours and is pumped full of uppers and stimulants, yet looks picture perfect. Was this a two-hour infomercial for Kidman Miracle Looks?

- Moral of the story is that war, violence, racism, disease and similar are what makes us humans, human. Peace, health, love and the rest are to be stamped out as they are foreign to our way of life. ??????

- Pumping patients full of prescription drugs to 'cure' their mental issues is presented as a good thing

- Plot has all the complexity of a single cell amoeba, but thank God they spent millions on car chases and explosions

- Nicole Kidman's breasts are like another character aa they are constantly emphasized

- Although not totally annoying, characters and scenes are sort of thrown in for no reason. Like why is the film set around Halloween? Normally that plot point is used to hide aliens (E.T.) in plain sight, but the aliens already fit in by taking over bodies. This movie uses the season for??????

Good stuff

- Veronica Cartwright's acting is phenomenal, and certainly well above the other actors here. Guess she did it as an homage to the 1978 version she was in

- Unlike traditional Hollywood blockbusters, a black man is the hero and survives until the end. And he's a scientist. Wow, what a concept.

- Like a soap opera, everyone has perfect homes and tons of money, so if you're looking for decorating ideas you got 'em

- The movie is never boring, just idiotic",1490054400,2,1728,4.517684887459807

I did like the various homages to the original, like the lady in the tunnel warning about the invasion.
This version, however, was disturbing, and it took me a while to realize why: The 'sermon' of the invaders is the same as the mantra of the democrats trying to pull the electorate to their 'oneness' and surrender all identity and self-determination to the state.
It really makes you frightened of what could happen with the degradation of the people of the US trying to get something for nothing as the DNC tries to promise.",1483747200,,676,4.504065040650406

Kidman is on camera so much that it's a study of her face that's a separate entertainment dimension by itself.  AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FIVE STAR RATING.  ;-)

This version refreshes the concept with great performances by Nicole Kidman and her fellow actors.  This fourth ( I believe) remake really creates the same sense of sense of anxiety for the characters as does the 1978 remake.  Good special effects, though minor, work well with the story.  Overall cast was obviously chosen with great thought as each performance from main character to small character were spot on, again, in my opinion.

You can really just skip this version and watch the vastly superior 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from the 50's if you're looking for a frightening movie. The story line is almost exactly the same, but the real terror or horror is missing. Nicole Kidman looks good and is an excellent actress and I have no problem with her, but Daniel Craig as the male lead doesn't fit. He reminded me more of an older brother to Kidman's character than a love interest. I think the ending was the most disappointing. A lot of sci-fi movies that involve global catastrophes have rushed endings where the good guys/US military/scientists overcome the bad stuff and within a few minutes it's sunshine and blue skies, as if nothing bad ever happened. Same thing here, except it happens in just a few seconds while a voice over tries to explain everything. Hollywood does love a happy ending.",1478736000,5,898,4.726114649681529

1586079,5,B00005JPUN,"I wonder if there is another science fiction film that has as subversive a message as this fourth interpretation of immortal novel, ""The Body Snatchers."" Based on the reviews I've read, everyone seems to have missed it. After all, Carol Bennell (granddaughter of Dr. Miles Bennell, no doubt), singlehandedly thwarts humanity's long sought achievement of world peace. If that's not the ultimate antihero, I don't know who else it might be. Satan himself has never had a more successful ally.

The first time I watched ""The Invasion,"" I picked up on it, but couldn't believe it. The more times I watch it however, the more I get it. The idea, I believe, is that world peace eludes us because we are slaves to our egos, like it or not. And I assume most people don't like it. Or at least our egos don't. We say we want it, yet in reality, we refuse world peace. Carol Bennell is us.

As to the film as a film, I don't understand the criticism. I have read that there were several problems in the production that might have compromised the finished film in some ways, but I find the criticisms to be petty. I do know that expectations generally lead to disappointment. I stopped expecting every movie I take time to watch to be major-award-worthy a long time ago. I now relax and look for entertainment, which often include films that are thought provoking and challenging, something that Hollywood doesn't do often enough.

The story is cohesive, compelling and frightening. Across the board, the production design is excellent. The lighting and camera work are top notch. The music is effective and doesn't get in the way. The characters are well developed, believable and the performances are excellent. And then there's that surprising message. Though neither a critical or box office success when it was released, I consider it a sci-fi classic. Not in my top ten, but maybe in my top fifty.

The '56 film adaptation, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 1950's and holds up very well for a fifty year old sci-fi melodrama. I'd place it in the top five American Sci-fi film of that decade. I also think the screenplay improves on the weakest aspects of the original story. The '78 remake is easily the scariest version and is probably my favorite of them all. ""Body Snatchers,"" released in '93 has it's moments, but is aimed at a teen and young adult audience. The older I get, the less I relate to it. However, I must say that all four film versions stand up and stand on their own. I know I will watch all of them again and again. They would make an excellent double, double feature, as long as you don't fall asleep.",1474675200,,2657,4.6109936575052854

I don't know if this is a piece of anti-gun propaganda or something, but TWO times during the course of this movie, Nicole Kidman gets a hold of a handgun, which she uses to defend herself with great success, and then IMMEDIATELY THROWS IT AWAY. What kind of autistic director decided that throwing away the only good defense was a solid idea. Instead of a reasonable plot, you will watch Nicole Kidman run for her life with no way to defend herself and no real plan for an hour and a half, and then all of a sudden everything is fine and the movie is over.

1587211,2,B00005JPUN,"INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) is a black and white classic film, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter.  The story was adapted from a 1954 novel by Jack Finney.  As many Americans will readily perceive, INVASION, a color movie starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, is a watered down copy of the 1956 film.  Watering down and padding take the form of techno-fluff, in the form of cell phones, smart phones, and Apple computers.  Truly, this film does a much better job at promoting domestic electronic appliances than telling a story.

In the original 1956, horror took the form of large pea pods, which served as the origin of zombified townsfolk.  But in the watered-down, techno-padded color version, instead we find that townsfolk, after being infected with a virus from outer space, develop a flakey, slimey skin, at a time when they are transformed into zombies.

Although one might characterize the color film as an updated version of the original, I think it is much more fitting and much more accurate to characterize the color film with Kidman and Craig, as watered-down, heavily padded, and painfully repetitive.  Every time a new plot element is introduced into the movie, it is repeated again and again.  And again.  And again and again and again.  The only redeeming feature of this movie are the many scenes with smokin' hot Nicole Kidman, sometimes shown wearing only her panties and blouse.  Regarding Daniel Craig, he is always good in his part, but this dragged-out, watered-down version of a classic American film, truly does not make good use of Mr. Craig's considerable acting skills.",1421539200,2,1646,4.967153284671533

which is a Updated remake of the 1978 version INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS
instead of having Body snatchers in the title this remake is just called INVASION
similar plot to the 1978 version but the special effects are more updated of course
you don't see clones of Humans being made out of flower pods like the 1978 version
you don't really see the transformation in this new remake
one scene you'll see a citizen acting with Emotion the next scene you don't
and it looked like the man had been transformed instantly into a clone
this remake is more of tight action thriller with some suspense thrown in
the 1978 version is the opposite, it's a suspense thriller with some action thrown in
i guess it comes down to how the film is Directed
the 1978 version is Directed by the Great Phillip kaufman who did a Great job directing the 1978 version
thou i'm a big fan of the 1978 version
the performances are fantastic in this new remake i must say,
 with a cameo by Veronica cartwright
who has a very small part playing a wife whose husband is not her husband
who gets therapy from the Psychiatrist played by Nicole kidman
you either like this new remake  or you don't, or you like both versions
for me i do like both versions actually. i like the 1978 version more thou

there are some short featurettes on the making of this remake
interviews with Nicole kidman, producer Joel silver and other interviews
this film is a really Good suspense thriller with a new updated twist

And both are eminently watchable even these years later.  But it must have seemed like a good idea; after all it was a big success twice before. Actually this latest incarnation is not bad.  Nicole Kidman is an accomplished actress and plays her character well. And she definitely decorates the screen. There is suspense, tension and action to satisfy the viewer. The pods are done away with but most of the other events and trappings of the original are retained.  What I object to is wasting resources to make a movie that has been made before and not actually adding anything to the production.  There are all kinds of good stories begging to be made into a fresh, new movie that can be enjoyed for its uniqueness.  It is a shame.  This is a movie that is OK but the money could have been spent more wisely.",1414281600,3,970,4.508571428571429
1587250,5,B00005JPUN,"I was sitting on the couch grading papers with the TV on in the background. So much of my writing starts this way I might one day write about that, but not today. What tends to be on in the background is sci-fi, generally bad sci-fi, because I just want the background noise rather than engagement.

Today, I accidentally watched good science fiction.

The movie was called The Invasion, with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Maybe you watched it and thought it was mediocre at best. I did too, sometime in the last couple of years. But today, I was paying attention (perhaps because I didn't want to) and heard all the subtext.

I think the best science fiction uses the science elements to set the scene for a human drama not possible or believable otherwise. Another Earth is a great example of this: the alternate-universe background is just that, a backdrop against which the story is told. We get to examine questions from different angles.

The Invasion is about an organism that changes people. It is presented as insidious and disgusting: it is transmitted, for example, by those already transformed vomiting into the beverages of those not yet infectedor, in a particularly disturbing scene, directly into their mouths. Infected people endure a brief hibernation when they next sleep. They become covered in a sticky chrysalis, a second skin. When they emerge, they are transformed.

Into what?

They are a strange mix of peacefulness and aggression. They express little emotion or pleasure in one another's company; they do not laugh or rage. But they kill remorselessly (dogs attack them and suffer the penalty; those immune to the infection are quietly disposed of), and those amenable to the infection are held down and infected against their will.

The first half of the film is the presentation of these new people, these others, as insidious and frightening. The protagonist, a psychiatrist, experiences one of them as the husband of one of her clients. He is a strange, dislocated man who arrives at her office to take his wife home, clearly a threat to her safety. Her son is with her ex-husband, obviously infected, and she wants to rescue him from this situation.

But some events later in the movie cloud the view here.

First, the alien hosts respect the protagonist's privacy. She is on a train, in the bathroom, and a young boy calls her out: just sleep and join us. She replies she will do so, she just wants to do it in private. He acquiesces. She paints herself with glue so she has the appearance of the newly converted and holds down her emotions, passing among the aliens.

Next, she tells the young boywho appears Asianthat she just wants to get back to her family. He says, ""We are all family now."" Later in the film, a series of news clips describe an increasingly peaceful world. Israel and Palestine reach a peace agreement. Venezuela and the US open their markets. And so on.

And, as the infected come to outnumber the uninfected, life goes on exactly as normal.

People eat, work, love one another. Once the old humans are eliminated in a given area, peace grows and blossoms.

Another suggestive subtext is how the infection works on its victims. It requires a hormone secreted during REM sleep. In other words, it happens while you are dreaming. And when you stop dreaming mid-sequence, you die. Once infected, your only chance to not evolve is to not go to sleepspecifically, to not dream.

The film leads us to wonder: why does the old model of humans resist the progress of the new models? Is their project to create a vaccine or a treatment morally well-founded? What would you give up in order to defeat racism and war?

The protagonist makes some suggestive remarks. First, she prescribes her patient an antipsychotic because the patient doesn't trust her husband. Later, she laments this decision. This closely mirrors our own world, where psychiatrists' first line of attack is to medicate problems. Could we grow out of this? She suggests we can. Also, at a dinner with some philosophers, she describes a future in which we have stood on the shoulders of the giants of psychology. Feminism has a place at the table, she suggests, but 50 years ago, it was a radical idea. People are evolving still. While we look much like the humans who wandered the Earth 5000 years ago, in what ways are we different in terms of cognition and morality? She is dreaming of a better future world full of better future people. How ironic, then, that she prevents herself from dreaming in order to not evolve.

There is some irony here, some tension between her two selves. One self sees the slow march of evolution and supports social change; the other sees peace blossoming on the news, knows the reason is this new form of human in front of her, and seeks to stop and reverse the change.

I think this film has it exactly correct. We are tending more and more towards peace, a global familybut there are elements of resistance out there that label ecological consciousness as eco-terrorism and concern for the public good as socialism (meaning Stalinism). War is for profit, medicine is for profit, food is for profit, racism is for profit. As long as some people profit from disharmony, harmony will be very difficult to attain. We have to do more than wait for old racists to die.

So, let's ask the questions. What would you give up to attain peace in our time? Would you let go of your stronger feelings? Would you accept strangers as your own family? Would you cut ties with zealots, abandon political party, work for the common good? Give up faith (and doubt)?",1413417600,3,5599,4.736896197327852

1587334,3,B00005JPUN,"""The Invasion,"" starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, is the fourth in the quasi-franchise based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel ""The Body Snatchers"" about an alien invasion where people die and their bodies become pod-versions of their former selves. The entries in the series are as follows:

- ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) - ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978) - ""Body Snatchers"" (1993) - ""The Invasion"" (2007)

The first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. The 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city of San Francisco. The 1993 sequel switches to an army base in the deep south. And this 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC (shot in DC, Baltimore and Los Angeles).

I prefer the 1993 film, followed by the original, and then the 1978 version and this one. What I like about ""Body Snatchers"" is the cast and the setting; the Army base naturally makes it easier for the alien imitations to go undetected. Unfortunately, ""Body Snatchers"" bombed at the box office and so did this one.

Although I like Daniel Craig, I'm not big on Kidman; I can take her or, more likely, leave her. Those who are Kidman fans will appreciate this entry more than me. It's not bad; it's got some creepy moments and quite a bit of action, particularly car chases, but the story's too city-bound for my tastes and filmmakers take the safe route with the horror, unlike the other versions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Why should every film end on an ultra-downer note? I respect this different approach.

The film runs 99 minutes.

1587337,5,B00005JPUN,"This is an excellent film that challenges the viewer to ask: Who are the REAL monsters? Is it better to go 'beyond duality' and live in harmonious bliss? Or should we reject the ""All Seeing Eye"" and it's ability to copy itself into innumerable human host-bodies? The movie shows us aliens who invade the human body and replace the target human...but then, the aliens are SO STUPID that they completely ignore the tremendous advantage this offers them - and instead of blending-in and gradually infiltrating Earth, they instantly reveal themselves to Humanity and alert the entire planet by acting like total weirdos who have no idea how to simulate being humans.
 But ask yourself this: WHAT if they weren't stupid? What if they REALLY exist? Could our planet be under the control of 'masqueraders' who only APPEAR to be human like us? But unlike ""The Invasion"", these 'masqueraders' can act EXACTLY like normal human beings? And, also unlike the witless 'pod people' of the film, might they take great care NOT TO ALARM US? If so, then we would be up against an invasion force that couldn't possibly be stopped. They would gradually infiltrate and replace all key humans on Earth...let's say they took control of entire industries like Hollywood - and even made movies about THEMSELVES with titles like ""The Invasion""? Is this POSSIBLE?
 The above scenario is a proven fact. Although the clueless human 'drone' population doesn't know it, our planet is under the control of 'BioDigitals'. These are people who are host-bodies for ""The All-Seeing Eye"". The 'Eye' invades the minds of humans and projects a digital copy of a Reptilian alien into the human target. The host can shapeshift to display Reptilian slitted eyes - which is why these secretive folks are often called 'Reptilian Shapeshifters'. All of the actors in ""The Invasion"" are 'BioDigitals'. In the film, they use their shapeshifting eyes to portray the aliens. For example, a black policeman approaches Nicole Kidman in the film right after an accident in which a hysterical woman is hit by a car...at exactly 22:33 of the film you can see this policeman display an actual Reptilian shapeshift in his right eye (the eye to your left). You'll need to zoom-in and go frame-by-frame to make this observation. You will see a slit appear and extend ABOVE his eye - going up onto his eyelid. This 'clown slit' is the signature way that BioDigitals reveal themselves. However, most of the shapeshifting in ""The Invasion"" is quite subtle. The style of shapeshifting in a movie is probably determined by the director (who is, of course, also invariably a 'BioDigital' just like the actors).
Most films do not place an emphasis on Reptilian shapeshifting...and when they do, the style is usually fairly subtle.
 I seem to recall a moment in ""The Invasion"" where a lighter is struck as they mention the power of the alien conspiracy...this subliminal theme seems to refer to 'Lucifer' - who is the intelligence behind ""The All Seeing Eye"", apparently. (For example, at the end of 1992's ""The Lawnmower Man"" we see Pierce Brosnan wishing that the power to guide the world with super-intelligence might someday come true...exactly as he says this, he strikes a 'lucifer' (match) and holds the flame before the camera.)
 Pierce would know! He and all other actors are host-bodies for the 'super-intelligence' of the ""All-Seeing Eye"". In the film, ""Salvation Boulevard"" starring Pierce and Greg Kinnear, we are shown a strange painting depicting ""The All Seeing Eye"" looming over a Reptilian...Pierce plays a minister who suggests the 'Eye' is the ever-watchful 'Eye of God' - but the scene subtly infers that the 'Eye' is actually the 'Devil'. (This is the humor of the 'BioDigitals' - who love to 'in-joke' about their true identity.)
""The Invasion"" is a thrilling (sometimes disgusting) movie - but in real life, the aliens just aren't stupid enough to act weird...They act just like everyone else. However, they reveal themselves through subliminalism (which is why we have the BioDigital 'in-joke' about how ""The Devil Is In The Details"".

I did enjoy more this version, and found it just as suspensful and scary (minus the hissing snatchers, thank goodness!). The performances, settings, and medical graphics bring the story into modern day in a fresh, exciting way. For example, the use of modern technology, not available in 1978, helped to move the story forward. The ability to communicate between characters with texts, video messages, and mobile phones builds intensity and excitement, and doesn't seem to be so high-tech and sci-fiish to be unbelievable. Nicole Kidman did so good with the emotional roller coaster and concealing emotions. As an actress, she's certainly had better roles that won awards, and she carried this film. Seems there may be some political undertones or message that I didn't pay much attention to. I just wanted a scary, fun, exciting movie and had this on my watchlist for awhile.

1587462,2,B00005JPUN,"I'm amazed it took Hollywood as long as it did to churn out yet another adaptation of Jack Finney's classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""

And to give the writers/director credit, ""The Invasion"" does its best to update the classic tale of body-snatching aliens for the 21st century, and has some solid performances by Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, the movie has clearly been ripped to shreds and sewn back together, with major plot threads dropped and an incoherent second half.

The space shuttle Patriot unexpected crashes back on Earth, and a strange fungus-like substance is found clinging to the wreckage. One of the people who encounters it is CDC director Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), who pricks his finger on a piece of debris.

Then his ex-wife Carol (Kidman) begins to notice things -- dog attacks, strangely stoic children, Tucker's determination to spend time with their son Oliver, and a patient who claims ""my husband is not my husband."" When her friend Ben (Craig) is called in to examine the Czech ambassador, they find that he's covered in a weird plasticky skin wrap.

They soon realize that a strange alien intelligence is infecting people, and taking over their minds and bodies when they enter REM sleep. The thing is, there may be a few people who are immune to their influence -- and Oliver is one of them. Now Carol much save her son to save the human race, but how can she stay herself when the whole world has been taken over?

First, some praise. ""The Invasion"" does its best to reimagine the ""body-snatchers"" story for the 21st-century -- instead of making duplicates of the humans, the aliens possess the bodies of their victims. And rather than imitating the 1978 movie's ending, this one takes an approach more like that of Finney's original novel -- or maybe ""War of the Worlds."" Whichever.

Done well, this could have been a diverting sci-fi story. Certainly the first half is a pretty suspenseful affair, with lots of build-up to the inevitable discovery of alien invasion.

But then... it all falls apart. The second half appears to have been ripped to shreds and reconstituted, a cinematic Frankenstein's monster that lurches pitifully to a rushed conclusion. Everything feels uneven and chaotic, with some scenes (Carol's stay in the convenience store) dragging on for what feels like hours, and a final scene that feels like it was tacked on hastily.

Also, some important plot threads and characters just... vanish. The suggestion of psychiatric drugs producing immunity is abruptly dropped, and two characters' fates are never explained. One is hit on the head with a hammer, and the other escapes the possessed... and we're just never told anything more about them. What?!

One thing I cannot assign blame to is the actors. Kidman is all porcelain chilliness, but with a core of fire inside when her son is threatened. I have to wonder if she chose this role as a subtle jab at her ex-husband -- she plays a psychiatrist who keeps herself awake with pharmaceuticals and saves the world from her brainwashed drone ex, whom she whacks on the head with a hammer.

The rest of the actors are pretty good, although not given much to work with. Craig gives a solid hearty performance as a doctor who feels more than friendship toward her. Jeremy Northam also does a pretty good job, although he mostly just plays a blank-eyed villain.

""The Invasion"" has the bones of a decent sci-fi flick, but the second half degenerates into a messy, chaotic, confusing disaster. It's a shame, because the actors could have done much more.",1363737600,,3585,4.879934210526316
1587463,1,B00005JPUN,"The first Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie, back in the 1950s, was so effective that the studio changed the ending before releasing it, to avoid terrifying audiences. Even in this mutilated form, it was a powerful and effective movie.

The second, in the 1970s, starring Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy, was beautifully done, funny, terrifying, well-acted, and haunted me for weeks.

The third, in the 1990s, set on a military base, was also effective.

This mother/child-in-danger scenario has been done over and over to the point of boredom. The son is immune to the alien virus. He may have antibodies that will save the world and momma, who was spit upon and infected by an alien. Yawn.

Instead of seeds pods, the deadly virus is passed via spittle and vomit. Lovely. There's no hiding and hoping to catch a few winks far away from an alien seed pod. The virus is already inside, placed there by a vomit-laced cup of coffee or a spit in the kisser. Double lovely. Sleep activates the virus, which turns the human into an emotionless alien. The only remedy is to stay awake... and run, run, run while being chased, chased, chased...must save son...must behave as though infected... avoid suspicion and capture...must stay awake... must find the son, save the world.

After an hour of this nonsense, I didn't care anymore, especially when I realized there was another 38-minutes to go. The movie drags on and on, running, chasing, eye lids fluttering, popping pills to stay awake.

The ending is as stimulating as the obnoxious run and chase scenes. I was going to rate it with two stars simply because it kept me watching to the end, but the finale wasn't even worth the time invested. I hated the movie. I hated wasting the time needed to watch this drivel, hoping it would get better. It didn't.",1336089600,3,1578,4.628571428571429
1587522,4,B00005JPUN,"What a great thriller! This film kept me in suspense from the start to the end. The terror and wild fear surrounding a modern society was not that far fetched. As a viewer one can compare the virus to avarice, and the oppression of the uninfected to the oppression of the foreigners and weak in society. The zombies reminded me much about Scandinavian societies, particularly about the people of Copenhagen. They had the same pattern of behavior, it was simply creepy! I believe that this film, however, convey an important message. The fact that we are vulnerable to many dangers as a species was diluted by the paramount message which cries out to stop the destruction within mankind. We, as humankind are the most destructive and pernicious species and it will demand a child like Oliver (a miracle within us) to make us all immune. I believe that such a child can be found in all world societies. Modern societies need therefore to embrace a savior like Oliver, but the sad fact is that such a child is a target in modern societies because modern societies are ruled by the jungle law. The zombies in the film are like people who adapted to the money system. Once they are infected they are doomed to decay but here the death is spiritual. The message therefore is a warning not to adapt to modern societies. The message is to resist the madness of the zombies (conformed people), hence this film is in fact a subversive film against the destruction which comes from the ignorance of the general mass. It was a brilliant film that made me think about the revolutions in each and every world society. The social harmony which the heroine dreams about is not that people will live like trees, but that people will feel like trees and love like trees. The message here is to follow love and intuition, but also to maintain a healthy mind. The danger to fall into the sleep of ignorance can be expressed by the fact that the vast majority of people simply do not give a damn about all the destruction which mankind causes. I was pleased that Oliver survived to save them all. I have found that Oliver in my society and I embraced him and followed his remedy. Have you found the spiritual guide in your society?

This is all the more so because I was on the edge of my seat and filled with the right amounts of tension the whole way through, only to be left aghast at the weak and `cop-out' ending that fizzled out without any impact. Following Nicole Kidman (who acts remarkably well in this film) and her family as they deal with the impact of an alien invasion that leaves the populations as hosts to the alien parasites, this film has excellent apocalyptic themes. You are nervous whenever she encounters an afflicted person and flinch every time she nearly gets infected and this never lets up for the duration. The story is well written and you are gripped the whole way through and then the end arrives and you are left angry and disappointed wondering what happened. At 90 minutes this isn't that long and they could have easily added an extra 15 minutes to tie things up more neatly. The effects are pretty good, everyone acts well and the direction is good as well. Overall this would get 4/5 stars for the first 80 minutes and then 1/2 for the last 10 minutes.

1587557,2,B00005JPUN,Invasion of the body snatchers is a classic movie from the 50's. THE 1970's version starring donald sutherland and early 90's version starring meg tilly  are also very good but his version is the new hollywood happy ending version. Even the excellent acting of Nicole kidman adn danial craig  can't help this because of the ending. The movie is similiar at first to the other versions and the premise remains excellent only this time there's no pods which also lessons the sense of alienation and change. On blu ray this one looks great but the movie itself lost all sense of what the real story was about. The other three versions remain well worth owning though.,1286582400,,664,4.7155172413793105
1587558,3,B00005JPUN,"I think the reason people rate this movie down is that you never see a lead actress naked, like in other remakes. Guys, that's not a reason to hate a film. There are plenty of great movies without any nudity, believe me. Haha, okay so anyway, I just wrapped up the 1978 version, and really, I believe it comes down to personal taste. After my third watching of The Invasion, I can safely say that I prefer it to Kaufman's gritty dirge of a film. Yes, the ending is terribly lazy, but I wasn't especially thrilled at how Kaufman's film ended, either. The 1994 remake is still probably my favorite, but this is definitely not bad. Although, the blood/viral animations portrayed in the lab are a bit cheap, the zombie who becomes abruptly conscious and grabs at her when she tries to take it's picture is stupid, there's an odd jump cut at 44:22, when she leaves her car in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and starts to run from some zombies, she looks back, the camera cuts, and in the next shot she's continuing the same motion of looking back over her shoulder but she's now in the middle of downtown. Odd. Also, the concept of transmitting the ""disease"" by vomit is indeed disgusting and stupid. The scene on the subway where vomit is being shot through the air like spitting cobra venom is awful. Luckily, they portray it only once in the beginning, and twice in the middle, and then I think you don't have to see it again. Despite these legitimate criticisms, I find the film to be substantially immersive and enjoyably suspenseful, with Kidman as a worthy heroine.",1285459200,,1574,4.565371024734982

One side wants to help people, or so they make themselves appear.  The other is definitely about greed, punishment and war.  The idea, of course, upon which these movies are based is a simple one:  Anybody who is diametrically opposed to your core beliefs (and some even have core beliefs that aren't prefabricated) is a cold blooded, unflinching, and evil robot.  An other.  A thing.  An alien.  This is the principle behind political diatribe, ethnic cleansing, or the employment process of any corporation or government agency.  Tell me this isn't so.

The cop out.  For that they get a well deserved thumbs down.  Sorry if I spoiled it for you.  Or maybe I just reassured you...

Except for maybe the second one of these bodysnatcher flicks, that cool 70s version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000QQJ3Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(they got it right), they keep screwing up the endings.  Maybe it depends on what regime is in power at the time of release (I think I see a pattern here).  Take the first one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/0782009980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>, for example (much as I love it)---I would have had the movie end with the lunatic raving and beating on cars, trying to tell people ""They're here already!  You're next!"" or whatever.  Hilarious.  You'd just know that he would eventually be picked up by the boys in blue and/or the ones in white with the butterfly nets, etc.  Urgent need for therapy.  The End.

As has previously been noted, the movie has action scenes and pyrotechnics, alrighty.  But they are visually interesting, unique, well done, not the usual.  And, yes, the infected spread the alien virus by barfing.  Why not spitting, I wonder (remember the initial AIDS scare?  Cop shoots man for spitting on him, afraid he was trying to spread AIDS).  Hell, they could sneeze.  There are also door knobs, shopping carts, or even toilet seats, for transmission of the deadly alien virus.  But no, as usual, Hollywood goes for the unsubtle, and the gross.  Which is how they view their audience.

The premise of an outer space virus as the culprit is an intriguing one, and was worth pursuing.  It also saved money on special effects for pods, duplicate bodies, and the like.  However, if you're going to introduce the antagonist as a cosmic flu, you should explain how and why a lowly virus would be trying to take over the world.  An engineered virus, launched by an advanced alien race intent on subjugation of the native populace, is a concept I would have found more credible (but that's not Hollywood---that is to say, simplistic---enough).  They wouldn't want to destroy us because they need us, like any great cult leaders worth their salt, as mindless menials and thralls to build and work in whatever incomprehensible instrumentalities they design as they slowly turn our beloved planet into a hellworld.  That's a movie I could get behind, so long as they leave out the sugar frosted ending and the melodramatics.  Science-fiction and fantasy author Jack Vance used a not dissimilar theme---case in point, of competing alien cultures introducing biological agents to subvert a planet they both wanted, battling each other by accelerating evolution and promoting competitive and antagonistic lifeforms---in a short story he wrote circa 1951 called ""The World Between""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Between-and-Other-Stories/dp/B0007EH8G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Between and Other Stories</a>.  Unfortunately, the film industry does not, as a rule, use science-fiction writers to produce science-fiction movies.  Which is a shame, because what you end up with, time and again, is an imbecilic shell of a story with overblown CGI, 2-dimensional characters, overacting, brain-dead dialogue, and lots of explosions.

I'd like to make one of these movies.  Anybody in Lalaland listening?  Give me a shot.  I wouldn't be so pc about it.  I don't think you have to reinforce an audience's preconceptions, and ignorance, with a happy-face ending.  Anybody remember Alfred Hitchcock?  Even if they didn't get it at the box office, at least it might become a cult film.  I would embed it in reality, not some fairytale with the cavalry swooping in to the rescue in the final scene, everything's alright, you can go back to sleep now (stupid, they told you not to sleep, didn't they?).  What a con.  The ""good guys"" are infected too, get it?  No?

But don't get me wrong.  This movie is definitely worth the 3 bucks I paid for it in the local cut-out rack.  I would hesitate to pay 5.  But then, I've only seen it the one time.  It was ok until that all-too-predictable touchy feely end.  Gotta reassure the proles.  If you depress them too much, it might affect their productivity.  Don't worry, we'll protect you.  OK we scared you, that's our job, but now we're going to bring you back to the warm, fuzzy reality of tidy soundbytes, simple solutions, happy endings, big screen teevees, and job security.  You're not really controlled by aliens who are exploiting you to the grave, wringing all your precious life force out of you before tossing you into the scrap heap when you're depleted, like a drained battery, for their own devious purposes.  That's just make believe.  You've been entertained.  Now it's time for bed (sure, you can sleep---it was only a movie).  Don't forget to set your alarm.  Have a good night's rest, take a tablet.  Then drink your coffee and make sure you're not late.  Busy day ahead.

A message is being insinuated as the celluloid winds along, a point made several times during the course of the story line:  Conflict, greed, war, rape and slaughter are bad---but at least they're human.  It equates a world with no conflict and destruction as somehow not human---even sinister and alien.  We humans are just a bunch of cut-ups, aren't we?  The implied subtext is that a world of conflict, tho' bad, is AOK so long as you occupy the high ground with the biggest club.

What's wrong with someone taking the opposite view, even if equally unsubstantiated, in some later cinematic reincarnation of the alien bodysnatcher theme---that war, destruction, and misery are sinister and alien induced?  And that peace, trade, and prosperity is our natural state.  Oh, heavens no!  That might hit a little too close to home.  This is entertainment, not revolution.

OK, I'm well aware that human beings are quite capable of very bad actions on their own, without any outside help.  I'm not so daft as to believe that this world would automatically be a paradise, if only those evil aliens would just leave us alone.  But there is a question of how much of this bad behavior is genetically predetermined, and how much born of social inequity and injustice, instigated, or at least countenanced, by a sacrosanct, generation-spanning rule of law rigidly and brutally enforced.  Just a thought for some budding young film maker out there whose family was wealthy enough to send him/her to film school...

By far, the best part of this movie is the graphics with soundtrack during the first part of the end credits.  That other stuff was just a warm up.  But then they quashed that with a blank screen for the remainder.  Maybe they ran out of CGI money.  Perhaps they didn't want to disturb you too much.

Maybe someday someone will make a version which would reflect reality just a little too much.  Then maybe you'd read or see/hear about how his/her promising career was unexpectedly cut short by a plane crash, car wreck, freak accident, etc.  But no, it probably wouldn't happen that way.  With all we've gone through in just the past 20 or so odd years, we probably wouldn't even notice.

1587626,2,B00005JPUN,"All the succeeding versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers have been weaker than the ones which came before, but they've all had interesting additions to the basic story of the pods taking over people.

The original (1956 with Kevin McCarthy) was the best because it was a low-budget film noir that didn't take itself too seriously. The Philip Kaufman remake in 1978 set in San Francisco anticipated the AIDS/STD crisis that was just around the corner. Abel Ferrara's version Body Snatchers (1993), set on an Army post, gave us a look at what happens when a society is increasingly militarized without wide scale involvement in the military by civilians for a temporary term of service, the way Americans experienced World War II.

The Invasion starring Nicole Kidman is the least interesting yet, but even it has a couple of intriguing ideas. I get the feeling it was intended to say some halfway serious things about the United States and its place in the world before a glamorous movie star got involved.

Pills have replaced pods in this version of the story.

Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman) prescribes a change in medication when a woman in an abusive marriage reports that her husband has become much calmer, except for strangling the dog when it growled at him.

Later one of the newly infected asks Bennell if she can give him a pill to prevent a Darfur, or a New Orleans.

Before the alien infection arrives on Earth, Bennell is caught between her ex-husband and her platonic boyfriend. We see both men before and after they're infected. Unlike previous versions of the story, people aren't killed and replaced by duplicates grown from pods, they are just transformed by an infection into a joint human-alien entity.

These monsters aren't the emotionless pods of previous invasions. One old man, after he's transformed, comes back to his wife and begs her to join him. His desire for the woman he's loved for decades seems real.

Bennell's ex-husband is a jerk before and after he's infected, and her boyfriend is the same calm rational man he was before. This invasion of the body snatchers doesn't really result in losing your identity. The peace that breaks out all over the world is almost as ludicrous as in the 1952 B movie with Peter Graves,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Planet-Mars/dp/B000G28GHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Planet Mars</a>, when God speaks from Mars.

I think the people who conceived this film wanted us to consider that maybe we should allow the infection to change us.

There's one moment at the climax, when it looks like Bennell and her son (who's immune to the infection) can't escape, when she considers surrendering. But they won't allow her immune son to survive and risk the new order. So she blasts away.

It's no surprise that salvation comes from Fort Detrick, where the scientists have been working on a drug (of course!) to reverse the infection.

The world goes back to normal, but the movie doesn't tell us that the scientists at Fort Detrick have kept a sample of the alien substance and are working on a way to turn it into a weapon. If that's the sequel to this movie, it may be the most honest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers yet.",1264550400,6,3257,4.955963302752294
1587627,4,B00005JPUN,"This is a surprisingly enjoyable and engrossing film.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much from it. Re-makes of classic movies usually disappoint. And this one follows in the wake of three previous versions - two of which are universally acknowledged as all-time greats. So what on earth could a fourth attempt bring to the table?

Add to this the film's troubled production history and much-publicised tales of failed test-screenings, shelving and re-cutting and it doesn't sound inspiring.

But I was pleasantly surprised. It's very watchable from the outset and draws the viewer into a disconcerting world of isolation and dystopia.

The film does a remarkably good job of recapturing the powerful sense of unease and creeping terror that was the hallmark of the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. It succeeds well at translating the themes of the original film into a modern context without merely repeating them in a different setting. It really hits the mark in terms of creating a disturbing sense of contemporary paranoia.

Does it have it's faults? Yes. Niolce Kidman's character, for instance, is at times annoyingly slow at grasping what she's up against and walks a little too predictably into trouble. And some of the plot solutions are a bit convenient to say the least.

All in all, I don't think it's quite up there with either Don Seigel's original or Philip Kaufman's re-make of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. Then again, Seigel's original was apparently viewed as cult curiosity in the 1950s before being hailed retrospectively with the passing of decades. And I recall that Kaufman's re-make got a pretty tepid reception when it was released in the 1970s - but time and TV repeats have established it as a worthy classic in its own right. How many of the films we regard as classics today were immediately considered to be when they first came out? The Invasion has the feel of a film that critics will probably be alot kinder to when they look back in years to come.

In the meantime, The Invasion ought to be enjoyed as a very compelling sci-fi thriller that's intelligent, thought-provoking, well-paced and far superior to most offerings in the genre.",1264032000,,2180,4.972527472527473

As with other movies of this type, those who have been ""snatched"" move slowly, calmly and peacefully. In this movie, that is how ""they"" tell those who are infected and those who are not yet infected. OK, a strange new infection is brought to earth from space. Once a person is infected (passes from person to person) they turn into these peaceful slow moving zombies. The key to the infection is to not sleep! The lead character is played by Nicole Kidman who does a great job. Interesting to watch how she learns to move about in the community of the zombies without being discovered. Usually zombie movies are low budget ""B"" movies; this one has high production values, looks great, and is well crafted. Call it an ""A"" class zombie movie. Minimal violence.

1587631,2,B00005JPUN,"It's funny how a movie that's supposed to scare you about what happens when you sleep, can actually make you sleepy.
This is the fourth movie incarnation of the whole body snatcher theme, and unfortunately it's the worst. Its not the fault of the actors, instead I would blame the writing and directing.
First of all, its already been done 3 times prior, not to mention a bunch of B movie knock offs, where aliens take over humans.
The original spin here is the replacement of alien pods with an alien virus. This is actually a plus for the movie, as the whole bodies growing out of pods, and almost nobody notices  was always a bit of a stretch. A virus that infects and takes over mankind is far more believe and thus should be scarier, but unfortunately it wasn't. The vomiting int o food or people as a way of spreading the virus was far more gross then scary.
the suspense and eeriness was good for the most part, but it  also felt all too predictable.
IMO despite its flaws the 1978 version remains the best and scariest of this franchise. It's creepy music, sounds effects and horrific ""pod scream"" kept you on the edge of your seat. That movie reminded you of what people were losing, first and foremost the ability to love, as well as the appreciation for music, and all of the other things that make us human. It's horrific lost cause ending, made you glad it was just a movie.
This current adaption, takes the opposite approach. First it attacks humanity a couple times halfway through the movie, and then again, with its unfullfiling ending. Rather then celebrating humanity, this movie tried awkwardly, to make  some ludicrous liberal guilt argument that the aliens are better, cause they, all just get along. The happy ending where everything is back to normal, just didn't seem believable and felt tacked on. And people's attitudes about world problems at the end, just made them seem ungrateful to have been saved.
Other then the virus twist this adaption brings nothing new and worthwhile to the story.",1247961600,2,2019,4.665730337078652
1587632,2,B00005JPUN,"The Invasion is remake of the 1950's sci fi film, ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Hollywood has already produced two remakes and one TV spin off. I guess folks really relish in the idea of invaders coming to Earth and snatching our bodies. This latest iteration was driven by a large budget and a couple of sexy stars.

Nicole Kidman stars as psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, and besides looking like the fine Aussie vixen she is, there isn't much for her to do. The films other big star, Daniel Craig, is so criminally underused he might as well not even be in it. This leaves Kidman to carry the film and frankly she doesn't look like she really gives a crap.

The first half of The Invasion is gripping and the story unfolds nicely, if not predictably. It starts going downhill during a dinner party scene where some Russian guy spits out some nonsense rhetoric. It's supposed to make you think, but I hate when a movie spells out the exact message it's trying to convey. Shortly after, the film resorts to redundant chase scenes of Kidman trying to protect her dopey son, Oliver. Once most of the populace has turned into aliens, there are some genuinely uneasy moments, but these are few and far between. The ending is really bland and it fails at the deep, psychological impact it was going for.

Like most aliens, the little spores in The Invasion don't ""come in peace"" and are rather hell-bent on assimilating all of mankind into their cold and detached species. This is done by projectile vomiting on a person's face or ingesting something an alien has blown chunks into. Charming isn't it? Once a human being has ingested the host, they eventually go to sleep and wake up an emotionless alien. The transformation effects are mostly CG and they look abysmal. After someone falls asleep it looks like Ron Jeremy crept up to them and rubbed one out on their face. However, instead of looking real viscous and gooey...it appears flat, fake and clearly digitized. It's lame and it minimizes any real chance this film had at leaving a terrifying imprint on its audience.

The Invasion is a squandered opportunity for a decent remake. It's clearly trying to exploit our disease fearing, xenophobic civilization but it ultimately falls flat. The excellent cast isn't given much to work with and let's be honest...there is much better sci-fi horror out there. I'm sure some will find it interesting, but most of you will be bored. Perhaps if we wait fifteen years Hollywood will attempt a better remake.

1587633,4,B00005JPUN,"One more invasion in the history of the cinema ? Banal. But this one is not  that banal because it really updates the fear. Not invaded by some kind of ugly green monster, please. Nor an egg laying alien. Let's be more modern and be invaded by something that is invisible and yet kind of ugly. Or rather gross, like some expectoration from a throat invaded by a serious infection. Gooey, gluey, inducing vomiting more than attraction. At the same time, beyond the bla bla about the DNA and its reprogramming when the subject is falling asleep, there is another myth: peace. To transform the most brutal and ferocious surviving animal species on earth and probably in the whole universe if not cosmos into a peaceful, peace loving and peace seeking bunch of automata. That's a dream for sure. Why not after all, to finally be able to love everyone and to forget and forgive all the evil the others have done to us, even if we have done to them maybe things that were worse. The peace you can only find during a funeral, provided no one has drunk himself or herself into a tantrum. That kind of future is frightening because you do not control yourself any more and also because there would be no fun in life any more, since fun is adventure, cops and robbers, wars, torturing chambers, dungeons, and a few dragons for fun on top of it all to crown the ice-cream with a nice cherry, you know the cherry you have forcefully taken from your neighbor yesterday night in the garden, though you just can't remember neither the sex, nor the age, nor the name or identity of that neighbor who just was there next to you when you had a sudden desire to eat a cherry and break it in. We can't really take that kind of fun away from all of us. Some of us need that fun, and I may say that maybe most of us need it. The film plays on that very well, till there is no escape what-so-ever, and there the film becomes a quick shortcut to a palatable end, after getting a glimpse of George W. Bush on TV. The poor woman and her son will manage to kill a few regenerated human beings who are no longer human, then she or they will kill a couple of dozens more ,and finally escape in a chopper that was handily flying by, and then on the following frame everything is back to normal, a vaccine has been found and the millions of weirdo sickly mutants have been brought back to normal. It is so nice to go back to school, to have pancakes that are not burnt, etc. The suspense is OK, the story is nothing phenomenal, Nicole Kidman wears and carries or even bears her name well, oscillating between the frenzy of a kid and the determination of an adult, but with a touch of French looking erratic psychosis. It is probably not worse than the old ""Body snatchers"" and the more recent remake of ""The War of the Worlds"". Just entertaining, though not that much inspiring.

Is it because it doesn't have an open ending like the other ones as this one has more closure on the storyline of the ""Invasion"" films in the past

I can appreciate also the slower ""thought"" process of this version. The creepiness of these people once transformed and how well they hide their alien-selves. This storyline allows for the audience to learn more insightful thoughts of the ""aliens"" and their viewpoints than in previous versions.

The intro dinner scene of the Doctors thoughts on ""progressive thinking"" is brilliant..it's an insightful poignant conversation eluding to a way of thinking most humans are blinded of based on ""their"" current living era and of cultures.

I don't think this movie could've been played by younger actors. Seasoned actors and Nicole Kidman was a good choice.

I have also noticed, in the past 20 years..a lack of appreciation for slower developing plots in films. Or is it lack of ""attention span"" when someone isn't always getting ""whacked"" on the screen or cars getting smashed.

I think what one has to ask when viewing sci-fi films..is ""Is this what I would do if I was her/him?"" AND How much fact is going to validate the storyline in this created world.

I think very few sci-fi films allow for full believability. This is of them that satisfies.

I'm finding so many flaws in the new Star Trek and Terminator storylines.

Such as in Star Trek..I don't find it realistic that a Starfleet Officer would eject and ""chuck"" a student (in a pod) to a death planet where he would be eaten by huge powerful ferocious creatures!

Terminator: I can't see ""anti-rejection"" drugs being available to organ donors in a post nuke setting! Which invalidated the WHOLE movie right at the end!.

I felt this this version of ""Invasions"" satisfies completely on this level.
I didn't feel like I was being treated as a complete retard while watching it!

1587717,4,B00005JPUN,"This was quite a good movie. Good characters, decent acting and nice, engulfing action.

It stars Nicole Kidman, a psychiatrist(?) who has to deal with an epidemic spreading around her. She tries to shield her kid and herself from the dangers that are around every corner.

Once people start getting infected, the worry for her son Oliver, who spends an enormous amount of time away from his mother (Kidman) only grows.

This movie features people catching a virus that ultimately, after you fall asleep, creates extra skin all over your body, especially in the face area and makes you almost unrecognizable. That was probably the nastiest part of this story.

I did like, however, how amongst all of the ""zombies"" were people who weren't infected and helped Nicole's character along the way. They were few and far between but it gave you hope.

All in all, I think this movie is underrated.

1587719,3,B00005JPUN,"Maybe I'm easy to please or give a partial pass to genre movies (probably a little of both), but I thought ""The Invasion"" was a perfectly good evening's entertainment.  I liked the characters, the story was creepy, and things moved along at a nice clip.  Whatever production difficulties there were, the end result has a coherent, smooth feel, and gets the job done.  We should all remember that there are hundreds of examples of revered movies that had troubled production histories.  Also, I'm guessing that original director Oliver Hirschbiegel couldn't have completely objected to some of the re-shoots and modifications made to his original cut, as he's right there in the special features section sitting next to producer Joel Silver, helping him promote the film.

Is ""The Invasion"" a perfect movie?  Nah.  It's strange that they hired an Australian actress (Nicole Kidman) and a British actor (Daniel Craig) and then had them both supress their accents to play Americans.  But they're otherwise good in the film, projecting tense involvement in the plot (as a quick aside, it was also kind of funny and a bit disorienting to see Mr. Craig acting alongside Jeffrey Wright, knowing they both were filming the James Bond film ""Casino Royale"" about that time).  The message was a little naive, too, if the producers were seriously suggesting that it might be okay if we all lost our emotions and passion if it meant an end to world conflicts.  But the idea wasn't pushed too hard, only suggested, so I won't make too much of an issue over that.

Plusses include some good action, creepy transformation make-up, and a genuinely scary, repulsive way the infected try to spread the virus (which some reviewers here have counted as a negative aspect of the movie, which I think is a strange thing to say about a film that's supposed to frighten us).  On the DVD, sharp picture and sound, and a handful of interesting extra features, further put this one over the top.

I wouldn't rush to make ""The Invasion"" part of your DVD library, but as a rental or something you run across in the TV listings, it's worth your time.  It might even be worth buying if you get a really good deal.

As a final thought, I'm not sure that I needed to watch the ""The Invasion"", with its heavy metaphor for the aggressive spread of deadly new diseases and viral strains and our fear of same, just as the current swine flu pandemic is reaching crisis proportions.

1587721,3,B00005JPUN,"The Invasion did not get a very good critical reception and I wonder why that's so. After all, this is a sci-fi movie about bodies being snatched by aliens. If you count up all the positive things in 'The Invasion', that will balance out the bad. Therefore, this film ranks a passable ""5"".

Let's look at the good things first. 'The Invasion' starts off simply and effectively. A shuttle craft plummets to earth after some kind of malfunction. Pieces of the craft contain alien spores which can infect and ultimately take over peoples' DNA after they fall asleep. The spores start spreading after souvenir hunters start picking up pieces of the doomed craft (there's a great line about someone selling a piece of the wreckage on eBay).

Tension builds as we see how the transformation of ordinary people into zombies affects the protagonist, Carol Bennell (a psychiatrist played by Nicole Kidman). We see these transformations beginning with one of Carol's patients who claims she no longer recognizes her abusive husband as someone she really knows (instead of abusing her, he kills the family dog without emotion!). Then when Carol leaves the office, the camera pans out to reveal what has happened to the wider society--now the 'pod people' walk around with blank stares on their faces while the enforcers amongst their group grab 'normal' people and infect them against their will. In a sense, the pod people (or better yet, the spore people) are a metaphor for cult-like societies (such as North Korea) who brainwash their followers into slave-like submission.

Carol's ex-husband, Tucker, works for the Center for Disease Control and he's infected early by the alien invaders. He returns from Atlanta (where he's had no contact with his son for two years) and suddenly wants visitation rights from Carol who has no choice to now let her ex see her son. Tucker obviously wants to infect the son, Oliver, (winningly played by an extremely talented child actor, Jackson Bond) but it turns out he's immune due to having contracted chicken pox as a very young child (don't ask me to explain the science behind why he develops an immunity). The rest of the movie is taken up with Carol trying to save her son from Tucker's clutches and also trying to avoid falling asleep after Tucker infects her.

I think that Nicole Kidman signed on to make this movie precisely because one of the themes is that the maternal bond is elemental. Carol bonds with Oliver and the two actors have great chemistry together (despite this being a horror movie, many women will be drawn to it due to the mother/son chemistry). Daniel Craig (looking much better than how he appears in the James Bond movies) is effective as Ben Driscoll as a low-key scientist who's trying to help Carol escape the clutches of the aliens.

A group of supporting actors in a scene taking place at the Russian Embassy also gives 'The Invasion' a brief window of respectability. Driscoll's friends are a Czech couple who are friends with the Russian Ambassador, Yorish. He ironically argues with Carol that the Social Dawinism of his hot-headed Russian culture is far superior to the wishy-washy liberalism of the West (pointing out that she seeks to take the fire out of her patients by dulling them with psychotropic medication).

'The Invasion' falters in the first half due to the screenwriter's insistence on depicting Carol as being completely myopic. Despite the fact that she is a psychiatrist and would naturally be skeptical of some of her patients' claims, there are too many clues that would cause her to become aware of the alien invasion much sooner than how it occurs in the storyline. The writers could have solved this lack of plausibility by perhaps establishing early on that Carol is one of those professional people who is so completely devoted to science and so contemptuous of anything that might smack of the supernatural that it would blind her to what was actually going on around her.

The second half of 'The Invasion' becomes repetitious with too many chase scenes and the clich of Driscoll, Carol's best friend, suddenly being taken over by the aliens at the film's climax. Jeffrey Wright is completely forgettable as Dr. Galeano, Driscoll's buddy who develops the vaccine that saves humanity. Finally, I didn't buy at all the news media's failure to uncover the alien invasion. Despite the horrific changes in the vast majority of the population, early on there had to be some uninfected people in the media who would have broadcast what was going on, not only on television but on the internet as well. Instead, the obvious changes are labeled as ""flu-like symptoms"".

I found 'The Invasion' to be mildly entertaining. Plotwise, it sort of ran out of ideas in the second half but technically the film was well-served by excellent editing and a moody and introspective soundtrack.",1236988800,,4868,4.913625304136253

Nicole Kidman plays a psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, who starts to suspect something's wrong with people.  At first, she's doubtful because her patients claim that their loved ones are imposters.  Little by little, she starts to think that maybe there's a ring of truth from her patients.

This particular Blue-Ray DVD appeared to be an exceptional video transfer on my large screen HDTV. The Invasion did not feature too many special effects but did open with some nice CGI animations of the space shuttle burning up during re-entry. Other very excellent computer animations of space-borne microbes and some exciting stunt and action shots did appear during the course of the film, but it was definitely not a special effects movie and aimed its greatest efforts at telling a fine story.

It told a good solid sci-fi tale open to many interpretations. I have watched all three productions, however, much as I liked the original felt this was somehow the best.  Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were both excellent.  Nicole was beautiful and appears to grow more so with each passing year.

The film is a little creepy and does succeed in engaging the viewer, or this one anyway. Upon viewing the ending the response it universly received was understandable.

But I went in with the lowest of expectations and managed to enjoy most of this arguably (somewhat) decent sci-fi flick marred by a very lame, unsatisfying ending. So, here's to low expectations.

But on the other hand I'm always against having low expectations in films. That's what most people do when they say, ""It's just a movie"" blah, blah, blah.. And I think we should have standards.

1587856,4,B00005JPUN,"Jack Finney's science fiction novel INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (serialized is COLLIER'S magazine in 1954; published in book form in 1955) was made into a highly regarded film of the same title in 1956, starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter in an intense and heartbreaking political parable of the times. In 1978 it was filmed (with the same title) as a satire of California society, starring Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, and Leonard Nimoy--and again was quite well received. In a third film version, BODY SNATCHERS: THE INVASION CONTINUES (1994)--starring Gabrielle Anwar, Terry Kinney, Meg Tilly, and Forest Whitaker--the focus seems to be on horror and suspense for their own sake, and although most reviewers rate it below the first two movies, many consider it worth seeing for its young female star if nothing else.

In THE INVASION (2007), the latest remake starring Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (the newest James Bond), and Jeffrey Wright, Finney's central idea is alive and well: i.e., our ""humanity"" (for better or worse) can be taken from us by an ""alien"" life-form. In this outing, the traditional pods are dispensed with and a much more plausible (but far less visually dramatic) virus takes their place. Ms. Kidman's character (a brave, intelligent, and attractive female psychiatrist) is clearly the protagonist of the action, which centers around her attempts to find and rescue her young son, who is important not just to her but to all members of the human race who do not wish to be altered mentally by the virus. (In a sense, Kidman plays a kind of heroic ""Ripley"" figure, parallel to Sigourney Weaver's roles in the various ALIEN films.)

This film abounds with tense action and dramatic chase scenes--as well as a few tender and/or funny moments between the mother and son; there are also several thought-provoking discussions of human nature that almost seem to have been spliced in to add depth and ""serious purpose"" to the film. Given the United States' recent and current national divisiveness, parts of this film may lead some viewers to see it as a parable about our religious/political factions. (I think this would be misinterpreting the film's intent.)

As far as the ""inner peace"" of the infected people is concerned, the script and acting suffer from many inconsistencies--with the disgruntled husband of Veronica Cartwright (who had been in the 1978 remake) and the ex-husband of Kidman among the worse offenders. (But, since logic has usually been sacrificed for the sake of vivid effects throughout 2,500 years of dramatic literature, why quibble about one more instance?)

The ending (which I shall not reveal here) strikes me as a bit ""rushed"" in the sense that we do not so much SEE the outcome as HEAR ABOUT it in a short voice-over that summarizes the later events in a minute or less. In this one respect, I will say it is comparable to the ending of M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS (2003), an alien invasion film starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, which I (in the minority) rated very low on several accounts.",1221177600,,3061,4.97265625
1587857,2,B00005JPUN,"Taking on a role that is a darker throwback to her role in ""The Stepford Wives"", Nicole Kidman makes another attempt at sci-fi remakes in this third onscreen incarnation of ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  It's rather amusing how this film uses only half of the story's original title.
 Kidman plays Psychiatrist Carol Bennell, the divorced mother of the Elementary school-aged Oliver Kaufman (an alert and intelligent Jackson Bond) who suffers  from bad dreams about his impending visit with his father (Jeremy Northam) whom he hasn't seen in years.
  Dr. Tucker Kaufman's first appearance in the film is as an expert who comes to examine the remains of a recently downed space shuttle. The plot thickens with the discovery that alien spores arrived on earth with the downed  craft. While leaving the scene, Kaufman cuts his hand on a piece of debris, which will have foreboding repercussions.
 We see Carol's daily routine, including work with her colleagues, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) and Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig), we learn of the tempestuous  relationships of Wendy Lenk( Veronica Cartwright, who appeared in the 1978 retelling of this story) with her husband, Richard (Adam Lefevre) and how that situation is linked to the main crisis in this story.
  But viewers also share a delightful evening with Carol, Ben, and their friends, Dr. Henrik Belicec (Josef Sommer), his wife, Ludmilla (Celia Weston, who has come a long way since her appearance in the TV series ""Alice""), and their friend, Yorish (Roger Rees).
  Soon, their world changes, and the streets are full of emotionless automatons. Those who express emotions, especially in the extreme forms, are arrested, and the plot revolves around Carol and her colleagues trying to make heads or tails of the matter. Field Blauvet has a cameo as a creepy Census Taker.
 Notably, the main method for the alien virus' transmission is through vomiting, and the film has quite a bit of that. Before it is over, Kaufman's behavior shows that he's channeled Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. It's amusing to think that Northam can now add throwing up on Nicole Kidman to his resume.
 Well, it's all been done before, but now it has a 21st century twist. It has good performances, but I can't say I was too impressed by this effort.
 Director Oliver Hirschbiegel did better with films such as ""Downfall"". While I appreciate his efforts here, I think he operates better in his own language from what I've seen of his work so far.",1221004800,,2496,4.966346153846154

The pace is very tedious, and sometimes you wonder why Carol, a psychiatrist can't keep it together without being emotional; which is what the ""pod people"" notice immediately. Oh well, she manages to ""cap off"" a half dozen ""pods"" including Daniel Craig (Ben Driscoll-he survives) her colleague in a drugstore attempting to escape, rather than give in and
join them.

I'm not a real fan of Nicole Kidman. There are times in the movie when you just want to shout out ""kill"" or ""run"" when Carol should kill, or run. I sometimes wonder why Nicole Kidman is given this type role; always the very weak-willed and vulnerable stereotypical female who just barely keeps it together just to survive.

*A few good, well-placed special effects.
*Good, strong, vivid photography and filming style.  At the very least, it is not too dull to watch.
*Still a valid and watchable story with strong themes about the dangers of society being invaded from the inside-out.  Corresponds well to modern-day society by incorporating the shuttle disaster and including some mention of other world-wide events.
*The science behind the story is strong and clearly defined.
*Also has a strong sense of paranoia.
*Includes strong themes about human nature; the emotional, irrational, and sometimes violent aspects that differentiate us from anything inhuman.  The dialogue and acting support this idea quite well.
*Characters, although not especially deep, are okay.  I think Nicole Kidman had a few good, smart moments.
*Has a happy ending!

The Bad Things
*Some parts are intercut together in weird ways, and may seem convoluted (although this could also be a good thing, because its unique and stylish).
*It is pretty predictable.
*What is this, the fourth time this story's been made into a movie?!

Of all the renditions of the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story, this one probably won't outdo the original 1950s or 1978 versions.

1587915,2,B00005JPUN,"The Invasion (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2007)

News flash: yet another amazing director is imported to Hollywood and crushed by the system. Film at 11.

Hirschbiegel, whose previous films Das Experiment and Der Untergang are two of the best films Germany's managed to come up with since the death of F. W. Murnau, took a quick plane ride to Hollywood to direct yet another film version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Because we didn't already have enough. Better yet, they saddled him with a first-time scriptwriter, David Kajganich, who has since gone on to write the screenplay for the next surefire bomb delivered by Joel Schumacher, who in the past fifteen years has stamped himself repeatedly as the worst professional director in America. Even with so many handicaps, Hirschbiegel managed to deliver something the studio didn't like, so they brought in the Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue (who was a pretty fine assistant director before coming under the Wachowski banner) to reshoot a good deal of the movie. So how much of this can actually be blamed on Oliver Hirschbiegel is subject to debate. And given the quality of his earlier output compared to that of the Wachowski Brothers, I'm very much inclined to give Hirschbiegel the benefit of the doubt, even if he didn't stick an Alan Smithee on the movie.

If you've been living in a cave since 1955, the plot: pod people are taking over the planet. Someone (in this case, Nicole Kidman) notices. As the rest of the world is taken over, our fearless heroine has to find some way to combat the invasion. Here, she's helped by her pal Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and his (very convenient) acquaintance, a researcher named Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), who happens to have an entire army base at his disposal to do research. It's tough to be scared by the pods when the army is working on the problem. Okay, wait a minute. Maybe I should have been much more scared by this movie than I actually was.

It doesn't help that I've already seen the movie many times, done by three other directors, but with Hirschbiegel's name stamped on it, I couldn't resist. I only found out about the Wachowski connection later. I would have avoided it, and rightly so, had I known. It's trite and predictable, with not a convincing emotion to be found anywhere. (Kind of telling when the main difference between the good guys and the bad guys is the inability to show emotion.) It's just another useless Hollywood remake; the only difference is they're cannibalizing their own instead of heading to Asia to get source material. **",1212105600,2,2571,4.8231292517006805
1587916,3,B00005JPUN,"The Invasion is a slick, sophisticated take on the terrific tale of the pod people we have seen so many times before. Or at least that's what the movie tries to be. Fourteen years after Body Snatchers: the invasion continues, an under-appreciated nicely executed sci-fi thriller, we are now subjected to a new tale of a spore threat that spreads by way of a virus. This time, the nasty business of having to deal with the disposal of useless shells of humans after pod conversion, is completely unnecessary. The virus simply merges with human DNA and the alien consciousness takes control of the host body as they sleep. The spreading of the virus is accomplished through a mucous spit spray, the movie's main downfall as this type of transmission has been done countless times before in different sci fi vehicles. Since we miss out on the special effect heavy scenes of transformation that populate previous pod propulsion, There is plenty of time for suspense laden scenes filled with the dread and impending doom as the takeover of humanity seems unstoppable. Nicole Kidman and the boy playing her son are absolutely terrific and believable as they try to resist the onslaught. They outwit the zombie-esque populous at every turn in subtle and not so subtle ways. Now for the bad: Daniel Craig is horrendous as Kidman's love interest. He displays less humanity before conversion and more emotion afterward. A complete disparity when the rest of the cast largely compliments the decent (tough dumbed down)script. With the focal point of the movie being the quick takeover of humanity, the science equation suffers enormously as there is little sense of the slow building progress and understanding of the alien presence that we experienced in the previous pod adventures. Instead, we have quick explanations that only seem to be a way to provide a brief break from the suspenseful scenes. I enjoy these types of movies when they provide a plausible chain of events around the learning of how the alien pathology works and the steps we need to take to stop it. The Invasion fails here considerably, and therefore gets a lower rating because of it. There are several political allegories that seem forced rather than a subtle side benefit as in previous films as well, adding to discomfort. So, the moral is, if you want a decent thriller to get your heart racing, it's here in The Invasion, but if what you're really looking for is an intelligent sci fi vehicle that truly delivers the goods, it may be better for you to see the other Invasions of the pod people. 3 stars",1211760000,,2572,4.834467120181406
1587917,5,B00005JPUN,"_The Invasion_ (2007) is a modernized and updated film version of the classic 1954 science fiction novel by Jack Finney _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_, starring Nicole Kidman as Dr. Carol Bennell, a feminized version of the main character in Finney's novel.  Finney's novel has been previously adapted to film on several occasions and each time has attempted to make a comment on the given era (e.g. commenting on the communist menace, etc.); however, this version has been compared unfavorably to those other adaptations.  Nevertheless, I feel that this version has something worthwhile to say despite itself.  The film shows what happens when an extra-terrestrial disease invades the earth and turns the people of earth into emotionless zombies.  Nicole Kidman who is a divorced psychiatrist living in Washington, D.C. in the movie (perhaps a jab at Scientologist ex-husband Tom Cruise here!) must unravel the situation as she encounters patients who claim that certain of their relatives or associates are behaving oddly or are not themselves.  Together with her son (who turns out to be immune to the disease), Kidman must fend off the entire city, including her boyfriend who eventually succumbs to the disease.  As the film unravels the atmosphere of paranoia builds and Kidman who eventually becomes infected herself must keep awake, else she too will become an emotionless and mindless zombie.  In order to better blend in with the rest of the populace, Kidman adopts a posture of stoicism, thus suppressing all true emotion.  The atmosphere of parnaoia builds and at times one wonders whether the whole thing is rather not a schizophrenic delusion.  Ultimately there is a confrontation between the people as they now are and Kidman and her son.  Kidman must choose between the invading alien presence and her former life and here the movie has a comment to make.  While the invaders offer a more peaceful world, they ultimately have no room for her son among them (he being immune to the disease).  Thus, we see how in any collective there is always one who stands out and how such a person has no room in the collective.  So while the collective may be more ""peaceful"" in a sense, it also is crippling to the superior man or the one who stands out.  In this case, Kidman makes the right choice and ultimately restores the world to the way it was before.  Thus, her son is saved from the alien menace.",1211760000,,2412,4.906403940886699

1587919,3,B00005JPUN,"The basic premise of this contemporary remake of the classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is not bad.  Spores from outer space cause a Space Shuttle crash.  Haphazardly at first, and then deliberately, these spores infect human beings and take away their individuality.  The film presents their arrival as a mixed blessing that poses a philosophical dilemma: on the one hand, it is human individuality that leads to violence and war; on the other hand, without human individuality we would be missing something essential.  What that essential thing is the film doesn't say -- apart from the only partly glib answer that Nicole Kidman's character gives when asked what makes us more than animals: that the fact we now have postmodern feminism should give us some hope for the possibility of a better world.  What this ""human"" thing that the infected peoples lose really is we can only infer from the fear that the characters in the film exhibit in the face of its loss.  The film poses a question, that in the case of this version of ""Invasion"" is more a theological than a political question: is free will and its attendant evils really worth preserving at all costs?

I like that the filmmakers are willing to push for the bold response to this question -- that peace is incompatible with individuality, and that the latter would be a fair sacrifice for the former.  On the other hand, I wish they hadn't pushed it so hard as to hammer in the contemporary implications of this message. The attempt to ratchet up tension by means of flash forwards and flashbacks that suggest the gravity of a situation also felt to me a bit overdone.  The film is lacking almost completely in subtlety, and doesn't quite make up for this in scariness.  On the whole this is not a bad film and strikes me as better than at least one of the sequels to the original ""Invasion"" -- and better than I had been led to expect from some of the critical feedback when it was out in theaters -- but not as good as I think it could have been with the talent and budget that went into it.  This may be the result of the studio's decision to pull the film from German director Oliver Hirschbiegel and make it into a more conventional thriller than he must have had in mind.",1211155200,3,2247,4.564676616915423
1587920,2,B00005JPUN,"I often find it perplexing why some actors and actresses sign on for some of the movies that they do, especially when it should be obvious from the get-go that the movie will not be all that great or even do remotely well at the box office. Case in point would be the most recent adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel The Body Snatchers called ""The Invasion"" starring Nicole Kidman (""The Others"") and Daniel Craig (""007: Casino Royale"").

""The Invasion"" follows the life of Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), a Washington D.C. psychiatrist, who begins to suspect that many of the people around her, and throughout the rest of the city are acting suspiciously out of character. As the oddities begin to mount, and the rest of the world follows suit, Carol along with her close friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) believe that maybe we have been invaded by an outside force. It appears that the change in people's personalities and behavior only occur after they have entered a deep sleep for the night, now Carol and Ben must fight to stay awake and stay alive before they succumb to the change that is quickly overtaking everyone in the entire world.

I really wanted to see this movie when I first heard about it, but I found it odd that I hadn't seen all that many previews for it prior to its release. Truthfully, I don't believe I saw a single preview advertising this film's release until a week or two before its debut in theaters across the country. Generally when hardly any previews are shown prior to a film's release, it is a fairly good indication that the movie will not be all that great, and it will nine times out of ten be followed up by rather lousy reviews from the critics. Well, go figure the movie was released and what do you know, the critics seemed to absolutely hate it. With that knowledge I figured I wouldn't see ""The Invasion"" unless it was a cheap rental or free on TV at some point. However, I recently heard that the movie turned out to be better than expected and that some of the critics may have been overly harsh in their initial criticism of the movie. So, I decided to give the movie a try, but after viewing it, I should have trusted the critics and my own instincts about the movie, and avoided it completely.

""The Invasion"" is one of those kinds of movies that tries really hard to scare the audience with genuine thrills, relying less on shock value; except it never actually succeeds in accomplishing its goal. The film's pace is way too slow, which works for some movies, but in this one it causes boredom to set in and a general lack of interest in the movie's overall outcome. The story for the film was somewhat strange to me, now I must admit that I have never read the novel on which this film is based, but I have to believe that for the novel to be as successful as it was it must have been more entertaining than this adaptation. Aside from the pacing being too slow, the motives for the invading force (presumably aliens of some kind, though we never see them or a ship) are somewhat confusing. It appears that their ultimate goal is for us to live in a world of peace and harmony, and they believe that the only way we can achieve this end result is for them to take us over. Well, that's all fine and dandy, except why go through all the trouble just to promote peace in our world. If they felt that we were too destructive of a race to ever truly achieve peace in our world, why not just kill us all, allowing them to set up shop on our world and then they could live in peace in our stead. At least that plot makes a bit more sense to me, plus it never was explained why they singled us out to begin with. I mean choosing us because of our destructive nature was their primary motive, but the fact that the invaders seemed to be willing to live out their days in our bodies indicated that they were content with living on our world. So, was there something wrong with their world, or was it destroyed or rendered uninhabitable? These questions began to become more pressing to me as the movie unfolded and the motive for the invaders began to seem more and more ridiculous and just too simple to believe. If the movie had addressed some of the questions I had raised, perhaps the movie would have been better, but the pacing still would have been an issue, though at least the actual story would have made a bit more sense to me in the process.

The acting was decent, but I expected more from at least the two leads in the picture, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Nicole did a fairly solid job as a single mother who is just desperate to save her son from sharing the fate of most of mankind, although in a few scenes I thought she went a little overboard with the hysteria as she struggled to find her son and then keep him safe. Daniel Craig was a little more on the other end of the acting spectrum; instead of going overboard in his performance, I found him to be a little too subdued and almost bored with his character, which led me to not care about his character's fate nearly as much as I should have. The supporting cast was alright, most of their performances were wooden, but I forgive that because I believe that was the way the director wanted them to act so the audience could differentiate between those who were normal humans and those who had been taken over.

In the end, ""The Invasion"" really fails to gain any real momentum within the story. The acting was decent, but a bit too uneven amongst the various performances that the unevenness begins to distract from the already dull story. Perhaps with better pacing, more consistent performances, and a much stronger motive for the invading forces, ""The Invasion"" may have proven to have been a better movie. Instead, ""The Invasion"" wound up being just another below average science-fiction movie that tried to take itself too seriously and found itself generally disliked by the critics and moviegoers everywhere.

""The Invasion"" is rated PG-13 for language and violence.",1209859200,3,6000,4.479890310786106

An Ex well I believed it, and the boyfriend they had chemistry.

The plot is a takeover used in form of a virus which fits in the 21st century. At least when people started to change it didn't make you have to believe aliens as little green creatures (even though there was green soup :)).

1587984,1,B00005JPUN,"With Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, The Invasion should be good. But it isn't. The people responsible for this film managed to make it just another zombie movie. In fact, it's worse than most zombie movies. Give me even a new Romero film over this one. At least the new zombie movies--even the bad ones--usually feature some critique of our culture. But The Invasion has nothing. Nothing.

Well, there is that one thing. The movie's main premise is that the world would be better if we were all zombies. No more wars, no more pain. The people who become zombies are actually happier once they turn. But this doesn't really make sense. Let's draw out the conclusion, shall we? The zombies still need to eat, which means that they still need to have resources like food and, therefore, money. Hence, there will still be a power struggle. Will there still be homeless people? Will there be presidents?

So is the movie suggesting that the kind of communism or even socialism so desired by liberals won't work? Is that the main point? It's not brought up in the film at all, but I think it's lying dormant underneath. The problem is that the movie isn't good enough to make it a primary concern.

Nothing can really top the 1950's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" anyway. But I have to say that this isn't a bad movie. I remember hearing about the pushed back release date, the re-shot scenes, and I remember this movie only lasting in the theaters about two weeks, so when I popped it into the DVD player I had a copy of ""The Mist"" on hand just in case it was so bad it would be turned off after only a few minutes. I have to say I enjoyed ""Invasion"". Nicole Kidman is always great to watch, and throw James Bond into the mix, with some really good special effects, and a clawing sense of paranoia...""Invasion"" provides a nice evening of entertainment. I liked the idea of a ""virus"" predator this time around, and I really liked who the ""virus"" arrived on Earth. (Sorry no spoilers here...but I see plenty listed in other reviews..so feel free to let them ruin the film for you..not me) There are some pretty tense scenes, and Nicole Kidman does a great job. Sometimes it becomes hip to bash a flick for little or no reason: ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Waterworld"" come to mind, and I think ""Invasion"" is suffering for that reason now. Compared to ""The Fog"", ""Black Christmas"", ""The Ring Two"" and a myriad of other truly lousy remakes, ""Invasion"" at least brought something to the table. I'll re-watch it so it was worth a purchase for me, but if your undecided, throw it on your Netflix list, and give it a chance.",1207267200,7,1537,4.492857142857143
1587987,2,B00005JPUN,"I did not see the original `Body Snatchers' nor read the book. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would want to. I expected this movie to be scary, suspenseful, and gripping. It wasn't.

I did not like the editing at all. The scenes were cut too fast, moving from one shot to another at a dizzying speed.

I didn't like the beginning of the movie when the Space Shuttle burns on entry and is destroyed. This scene should have been much longer. We should have seen how the alien parasite clung itself to the shuttle. Was it the reason why the shuttle crashed? We should also have seen the crew struggling to fly the Space Shuttle.

Once the Shuttle crashed, the scenes rushed way too fast from identifying the parasite to it infecting people. I just felt the whole movie was rushed.

Seeing Nicole Kidman run away from something at the beginning of the movie just didn't make since. The editor was trying to show us an event in the future to keep us guessing, but this didn't work. The movie should have flowed in a linear manner, not jump from a future event to a present one. This was repeated in several other scenes, and I found this to be very annoying.

The disease is passed by people throwing up. I found this pretty repulsive, especially in the subway scene. Kidman's husband also throws up on her face, yet we see her in the following scene with a clean face and no stains on her shirt--very unbelievable. And what about the stench of the vomit? Kidman then meets up with researchers and eventually with her son--without having taken a bath. Didn't her husband just puke on her? Did no one smell her?

The helicopter scene at the end of the movie was not well done. You could tell it was animation.

Daniel Craig did not do a good job at all. He was more of a supporting actor than a principal one.

At no point throughout this movie did I find myself glued to my seat. There was no suspense; nothing really exciting happening.

The fact that they found a cure so quickly was also unbelievable. We are also not shown the steps taken to find the cure--was way too rushed.
I didn't like the cover design of the DVD either.

The only thing I liked about this movie are the following questions, ""what would life be like without humans? If a disease turned us into non-violent people, but unproductive, would that be good or bad? Is life better the way it is, with free-will, or one without free-will and without wars?

It was never an Oscar contender or high art but in my Drive-in days, this would have been a winner. We've seen various iterations of Invasion of the Body Snatchers over the past 50 years so there's no suspense in the basic premise.  This version quickly hones in on a mother and son caught up in this horror and their battle to survive. Their battle to survive is very suspenseful.  The child actor does a nice job as the son and Nicole Kidman is convincingly fierce as his mother who will do anything to protect him.  I'm reminded of Ripley in Aliens, going up against the monster to save the little girl.  This film nicely captures the heebie-jeebie factor of being forced to blend in as humans suddenly becoming souless, emotionless killers, in a sense, as the aliens' quest is to take over Earth by killing the humanity inside of us.

They completely lost the mark here. The camera trickery did not add to the tension, it disarmed it. The flash forwards and flashbacks didn't help to keep the story in line. The opening flashback, we find out later in the film, was not a THE critical moment. For this version I think THE critical moment would have been when Nicold Kidman walks into her son's bedroom and pauses, waiting to discover if he's changed or not. The two face each other for minutes before disclosing anything. Now that would have been the critical moment.
And the ending!!!! Please! Sappy sappy sappy. In each and every other version of this paranoid, claustraphobic thriller the main character ends up succumbing to the force greater than it. What could they have been thinking here?? It's actually an insult to the story.
The original is the best. The third version, with Meg Tilly, is actually quite the thrilling interpretation of the story. The second version was a bit on the lame side, but kept the story. This one lost everything.

The film opens with a very frantic Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) rummaging through the shelves of a pharmacy searching for sleep suppressants.  We are then taken back in a recent past where a space shuttle crash lands into the countryside.  From the moment that Bennell's ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) pricks his fingers on a foreign organism, life becomes a serious drag for the human species.  Bennell, who is a psychiatrist, doesn't get it at first when one of her patients irately claims her husband isn't her husband.  But it doesn't take long before Bennell figured out that all is not right.
This could have been an excellent film, but as is all too often the case these days, character development was not a priority. Beyond Kidman, character development was non-existent. How people are being snatched, also, is never adequately, not even remotely explained.

The Wachowski brothers were hired for massive rewriting and James McTeigue directed the new scenes. The result is a film that takes an unexpected turn for the worse.

What's new in this rendition is that the victims of the alien virus aren't replaced by duplicates. Instead, the virus just acts within their own bodies, changing them so that they act as one organism-- we're talking a slightly nicer version of the borg from Star Trek. The idea of a more benevolent invader would have been a fresh interesting take and was where this movie was headed before the hack job. It would have been more insidiously delightful to explore the cost benefit analysis of succumbing to the invasion. No more wars, cruelty, and poverty on one side, while the stripping of a lot of what makes us human on the other-- also the collective vs. the individual.

 I think the studio should take the blame for dooming a film that had some potential. It's still an enjoyable watch and worth a rental, especially for alien invasion enthusiasts.

Aside from being able to bask in the magnificence of Ms. Kidman, who is indeed magnificent and does all she can with her role, this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Sophomoric white bread direction, shameful use of news footage and witness interviews from the latest shuttle disaster, zero character development, bland camera work and editing, no emotions (it's hard to tell when characters have turned since aside from Kidman the screenwriters and director don't allow the cast to convincingly exhibit any emotion while still human,) and no pods!

This could be a hundred other movies over the last twenty years - bad guys chase good guys around downtown Washington DC, car chases every five minutes, cell phones, elevator buttons, basement parking lots, cars on fire, child must be rescued, blah blah blah.

Oh, and instead of pods the ""disease"" is passed by people throwing up. In people's coffee. In each other's faces. Nice, thanks for that. That's really challenging intellectually. That's fine scriptwriting. Is that the Academy calling?

The original remains an almost sacred masterpiece and it still hasn't been topped. The remake staring Donald Sutherland was excellent and genuinely creepy, cleverly directed and scripted. The third version was quite OK. This edition is beyond lame and doesn't for a second create a tenth as much mood as an average Twilight Zone episode.

The editing and pace of the story was excellent, writing crisp, and Ms. Kidman seems to be aging beautifully (of course ""aging"" is not the correct term to use here. Surely, the actress is growing older, but her beauty is sharper and clearer than when she was younger, as if time were shaping away all parts of her that didn't glow). Also, the film makers seemed to understand that true horror in film is always psychological and NOT physical or visceral (meaning SAW I, II, III, IV were not scary at all).

But, I suppose it was inevitable. About half way in things began to unravel. The pace became overheated and characters suddenly became very, very boring. Buy the end of the film it was a stock, very un-special action/car-chase movie.

Finally, whereas the book and two previous films worked from the premise that, yes, the alien invaders offered a world without war, hunger, rape, strife, etc; it was much grander and more joyful to be human.  The concept of this film was that, clearly, it would have been better to allow the aliens to take over, and the only reason the Nicole Kidman character resisted was because her son was ""immune"" to the transformation and was going to be ""taken care of."" Thus, the film makers miss, subvert, and completely loose what made the original novel and original film so special.

All in all, a film made by aliens, absent of the strife, chaos, and inspiration that make it such a blessing to be human. - Mykal Banta",1202860800,4,1544,4.6036363636363635

Apparently the studio didn't like the cut director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered. My suspicion is that the original film, which was completed in 2006, was probably more coherent. The Wachowski brothers were hired for massive rewriting and James McTeigue directed the new scenes. The result is a film that takes an unexpected turn for the worse.

What's new in this rendition is that the victims of the alien virus aren't replaced by duplicates. Instead, the virus just acts within their own bodies, changing them so that they act as one organism-- we're talking a slightly nicer version of the borg from Star Trek. The idea of a more benevolent invader would have been a fresh interesting take and was where this movie was headed before the hack job. It would have been more insidiously delightful to explore the cost benefit analysis of succumbing to the invasion. No more wars, cruelty, and poverty on one side, while the stripping of a lot of what makes us human on the other-- also the collective vs. the individual. This probably would have come closer to Don Siegel's communist cold war scare overtones in the original movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/0782009980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>.

Instead the movie moves to more action sequences of fighting against a overtly hostile threat. This is where the original idea gets abandoned and the movie loses its way.

All of the actors put in decent performances here including an admirable job by Nicole Kidman in the lead role, Daniel Craig as her love interest (an excellent new James Bond by the way), a very good cameo from Veronica Cartwright (in the 1978 remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Snatchers/dp/0790742462/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Snatchers</a>), Jeremy Northam as the somewhat creepy ex-husband, and Jeffrey Wright as the scientist.

 I think the studio should take the blame for dooming a film that had some potential. It's still an enjoyable watch and worth a rental, especially for alien invasion enthusiasts.

(Hope nobody noticed that I am the chairman of the Kidman fanclub in Morning Land.)
One objection to the script: the story is 50 years old, the efforts to place it at the turn of the century have given us some nice anachronisms. There is a Czechoslovakian Ambassador in the story, at the same time that the Irak war and the Darfur crisis are issues.

1588160,4,B00005JPUN,"Okay, as someone who considers himself somewhat of a ""Body Snatchers"" afficianado, here is my opinion of the 4th version of Jack Finney's 1954 sci-fi novel (actually the 5th version, if you count the musical adaptation written for the stage...yes, this really exists!!!).

Obviously, there is something about the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story that strikes a chord in the human psyche.  It consistantly makes producers want to re-invent it and audiences want to see it again.  Let's face it: the plot is full of holes and truly off-the-map logistically.  But who cares?  Not me.  The hook is its terrifying emotional impact, targeting our fears of being trapped in an apathetic, zombie-like society.  For my money, the best of the ""Body Snatchers"" is Phillip Kaufmann's 1978 rendition, which literally drips with atmospheric dread and paranoia.  It brings Don Siegel's 1955 version (which capitalized on McCarthyism and the Red Scare) crashing into a new era of psychoanalysis and the search for happiness.

Abel Ferrara's 1993 re-make has its moments (interestingly, it's set in a military base).  However, all-in-all, the script feels undeveloped and the movie never reaches the full potential of either the original book or its two cinematic predecessors.

So where does this leave ""The Invasion"" in the ranks?  In my opinion, not only is it not nearly as bad as people say it is, I'm going to go out on a limb and call it pretty darn good.  When a friend and I decided to see it in the theater despite the bad press, we turned to one another halfway through, surprised by the all the bad buzz.  True, the ending sucks, and I missed the pods from another world, however implausable they may have been.  But there are quite a few jolting scares, and some weird originality added: the creepy guy at the door taking a survey in the middle of the night, the viscious dog attack, deformed bodies slithering across the floor, and of course, all that unexpected projectile vomitting!  Also, rather than being replaced by pod people, the victims of ""The Invasion"" actually remain themselves, only drastically altered by an extraterrestrial virus.  This finally makes sense of the lines uttered by all the body snatchers in all the films, that the victims will still remain who they are, only greatly improved after being taken over.  Previously, this had always seemed like a pathetic selling point to get the victims to calm down, since it was obvious they were not going to continue in their current state, but be completely replicated, as their original forms  disintegrated.

So there's my take on ""The Invasion"". Hey, why not read the original book, along with ""They're Here...! A Tribute The Body Snatchers""?  Then you can rent all of the movie versions, and have a ""Body Snatchers"" weekend . . . while you wait for the next adaptation to come out.",1202342400,4,2857,4.898128898128898
1588200,3,B00005JPUN,"The Invasion, a remake of the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, is actually a very well made and executed remake. Greatly aiding this remake is Nicole Kidman's performance which helps the film along immensely as well as the intelligent script and stylish camera work.

After a space shuttle explodes on its' re-entry back to earth pieces of it litter the neighborhoods and fields below. The particles of debris bring a deadly virus that spreads quickly from person to person before scientists are able to retrieve it. Meanwhile Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell a psychiatrist whose starts realizing something is wrong. Daniel Craig plays Ben Driscoll a doctor and friend of Carol's who is coming to the same realization. When Carol finds a mysterious moving piece of visible organism on one of her son's friends, she takes it to Ben to have it checked out. The story quickly picks-up from here and then speeds up even more, stopping only very briefly for the conclusion.

I am normally not a fan of sci-fi/alien/virus movies but, this was done so well through the performance of the actors, and the filmmakers that it draws you in at the opening scene! I really liked how you do not see the virus spreading. Almost everything is seen through Carol's eyes so you do not realize the how bad the situation is until almost everyone is in infected. And as Carol flees from them, running into more wherever she turns, it slowly draws you into this horrifyingly claustrophobic world, and holds you, building the tension, not letting go until the end.

As I said Nicole Kidman does a wonderful performance as always, Daniel Craig is charming as ever, and Jeremy Northam plays his role chillingly well as the ex-husband of Carol.

Overall a extremely well made, well acted remake, that at the very end turns almost insightful.",1202256000,3,1821,4.845659163987138

Now we have Nichole Kidman in a faster paced (and that is the only strong point of this movie) and this time around it is more high tech. A space shuttle crashes to earth bringing a deadly virus that instead of replicating humans, invades their DNA and turns them into the previous ""pod people"" incarnations. The sudden flash and pan of reactions truly hurts this movie and leaves it without an emotional center as she searches for her son whom may be immune to this virus transmitted this go around through body fluids.

Veronica Cartwright who played a strong supporting role in the remake is very good in the cameo and is able to convey more emotion in her short screen time than Kidman who dominates this tale.

Again, if it wasn't for the faster pace (which made the original so enjoyable--along with the unique premise at that time), this movie would just be another inadequate remake.

I am not endorsing it. Again, never fix something that isn't broken. Hollywood is running low on ideas, they are crafting big budget comic book movies, remakes of TV sitcoms (Kidman was seen in the movie version of ""Betwitched"") or tamping with classic movies.

The movie does boast some special features--which isn't say a great deal, they are pretty standard for the newer films.

1588204,2,B00005JPUN,"Well, the release date has been played around with a few times, not that that hurts it. Todays the 29th and its out. The 3 prior body snatcher movies were excellent and really did somehow intertwine the social feelings of each era in which they were released. They were all very impactive in that sense. This current film which uses all the body snatcher cliches to the hilt, misses the excellent chance of fully capitalizing on a post 9/11 worldview. A few backround tv scenes covering world events was an overly overt attempt at putting a sociological stamp on this version. It mostly failed.

  I don't feel its important for me to rehash the storyline because everyone(except for one reviewer living under a rock)knows the premise of a 'body snatcher' film. I bought the film in HD expecting to see at minimal some thought provoking ideas. So much was left out that could have been interjected in a concrete way. What I'm trying to point out is the missed opportunity of capturing our CURRENT era, and all that comes with it. I have to admit though, when this film is looked back on several years from now it might show some distinctions. Can we get away from the immune child notion? Its a sort of forced storyline to invoke heartfelt compassion. In turn, those scenes looked just short of a big tv movie. Important fact; body snatcher movies NEED PODS. Very cool techniques could have been employed with pods these days. Vomiting on individuals was disease oriented but came off a little silly. Their was some jumping around in the film that did't quite fit. Trying to show you one scene ahead with the action while they were in another totally messed up as far as editing.

  I wanted to like it, and their were some good parts. The changing bodies were realistic, but I was surprised their weren't more scenes that could have been creatively played with in regards to them. Nichole Kidman was decent and she had the proper look of confusion in the beginning. Her subway chase was alright. Daniel Craig was completely miscast and seemed to be walking through it. As a trivia point, Kidmans first patient is the actress Veronica Cartwright who was in the 1978 remake version. Unfortunately her speaking role was almost a duplicate of that version.
  The sci-fi idea of aliens attacking us and removing our true core is great stuff. Its such good stuff that I really expected more in this age of film making. It does go to show you that even this brand of sci-fi has a stopping point, and this is it.",1201651200,2,2505,4.626126126126126

Perhaps the other reviewers are hung up on the fact that this is not an exact remake of the original 1950's version. Well, get over it.

1588207,4,B00005JPUN,"Sometimes a movie gets really terrible reviews and after I see it I often wonder why there is so much hate for it. I've seen movies that got bad reviews that I might have liked, but I do understand why it gets so many negative reviews. But in the case of The Invasion I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. The Invasion almost seems like a love it or hate it movie, while it does have its flaws I found it to be a fun ride.

The Invasion is the 3rd remake of the 1956 classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers and so far I have liked all four versions as well as the unofficial remake The Faculty and I even enjoy some of the knock off films. The Invasion is sort of pointless sense it really doesn't add anything new to the story, though it does attempt to. I just love the concept for these movies and thus far I haven't been letdown yet.

After The Invasion was shot it went through quite a few re-shoots and at times you can tell there was some studio tampering, Andy & Larry Wachowski did some rewrites while James McTeigue was hired for re-shoots. But none are credited and since I don't exactly know who did what I have to go based on the credits and only mention the original writer and director regardless of what they did.

The screenplay was written by Dave Kajganich and overall it wasn't bad at all. There were some good ideas presented that try and put a twist on the story and some work well and others don't seem to work as well. Overall though the script wasn't bad by any means; the characters are fairly decent, but not enough was done with them. The characters in this you won't dislike, but you don't really like as well. One of the twists on the story is the pods are gone. How can you have a Body Snatcher movie without pods? This time around the aliens instead vomit on you.

Yes you read that right; ok so maybe it's not vomit, but they spray things out of their mouth so what would you call it? That concept is a little silly and when they do it odds are you'll get a bit of a chuckle out of it. They also infect people by tricking them into getting flu shots, which was much better than the vomit. Also some people are immune to the alien virus, which was an interesting idea that sort of works.

Oliver Hirschbiegel makes his American directorial debut and for the most part does a good job. The Invasion runs at a pretty good pace and there are some fairly creepy moments and while they do lack a little bit it still mostly works. Oliver Hirschbiegel manages to get some decent suspense, but when all is said and done some scenes do lack and The Invasion really had potential to be a great movie, but I still think it mostly works and ends up being a good movie. The Invasion isn't as chilling as the previous 3 versions, but I do think there were a couple of creepy moments.

What I loved about the 1978 version is the movie gets to this point to where you don't know who is one of the pod people and who is still human. Even the people passing on by who are nothing more than extras you start to wonder if they are pod people. It has this great presence of paranoia. The Invasion never quite reaches that level sadly, but there is still some suspense even if not as suspenseful as the past installments. I suppose all the blame can't be placed on Oliver Hirschbiegel, but despite those flaws I still think he did well.

Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell and does a fairly good job. I'm not the biggest fan of Kidman, in general her movies don't really interest me, but she is a talented actress. The problem here is her performance is just sort of boring. If you didn't know any better you would think she was one of the aliens. She really doesn't show much emotion and again not a bad performance, but sort of boring. Daniel Craig played Ben Driscoll and like Kidman he also gives a good, but boring performance.

I did enjoy The Invasion, but it is the weakest of the Body Snatcher series. It lacks the thrills and chills of the previous 3. And while it does move at a slightly better pace than Body Snatchers, it never gets as chilling as that movie was at times. But despite all that The Invasion while pointless does make for a good time. I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. Again it's not a great movie and the weakest of the Body Snatcher series, but overall it is a pretty good movie.

More often than not a lot of people forget how important editing is and that is one of the biggest flaws with The Invasion. While there was some suspense and some creepy moments there could have possibly been more if not for the editing. In one scene Carol and Ben are in a room talking to each other and the next scene they are in a car trying to get away, cut back to them in the room talking and cut back to them in the car. In an earlier scene Carol is at home the next at work and the next back home again. All that does take away some suspense from the scenes and also the transition from one scene to the next sometimes is a little sloppy.

My biggest complaint though is the ending; while I can't say much since it would spoil the movie. While I suppose it's not a Hollywood ending in the traditional sense, but the ending isn't as bleak as the previous 3. Like I said I really can't say much seeing as it would spoil the movie. It's not really a happy ending, but not dark like the other installments, which would have fitted better.

In closing, The Invasion really isn't as bad as the reviews seem to make it, while far from a perfect movie and not as chilling as the other 3 versions, The Invasion does provide a couple of jolts and despite the shortcomings I found it enjoyable.

Look for Veronica Cartwright of the 1978 version in a small role as Wendy Lenk.",1201651200,6,5729,4.236263736263736

I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.

Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a ""glorified zombie movie"" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a ""Zombie"" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected.

Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. We start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. They're smiling too much, they're too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. At first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.

The horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.

And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for our aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and without a soul.

The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.

EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near as good as the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.

Director Oliver Hirschbiegel set out to make an artier and edgier take on Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/0684852586/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>. However, the studio did not like his version and producer Joel Silver brought in his pals, the Wachowski brothers to rewrite the ending and director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to reshoot it. The result was a film that flopped both commercially and critically. Now that all of the dust has settled and it is finally being released on DVD, The Invasion can be reassessed. Is it really that bad?

There are a few annoying jumps in logic, like Carol abandoning her vehicle for no good reason and dropping a gun on two occasions that she could have used later on. For a supposedly intelligent character, she doesn't make very smart decisions at times.

This is the fourth adaptation of Finney's novel and so far all of them have paled in comparison to the first one, directed by Don Siegel, which was also the most faithful to the source material. The reason that this story keeps being remade is that the allegory for the stifling oppressive nature of conformity is so powerful and still relevant after all these years.

While the aliens offer a world without pain and suffering, it is also one without joy and happiness. The Invasion updates this classic story for our times as it channels some of the anxieties of our age: avian flu, SARS, 9/11, the Patriot Act, and so on. In a nice change, this film also deviates from previous adaptations by going in a different direction with how it ends. Some may cry sell-out but it feels true to the rest of the film. The Invasion is hardly as awful as some critics would have you believe. If you go in with low expectations you may come away pleasantly surprised by the end result.

""We've Been Snatched Before: Invasion in Media History"" examines how the Body Snatcher films commented on the times in which they were made and this new one is no different. This featurette also examines the fears that the film addresses, including virus-based threats and how he deal with them, in this informative extra.

""The Invasion: A New Story"" takes a look at how this film updates Finney's original story for our times in this brief, pretty standard promotional featurette.

""The Invasion: On the Set"" examines how they shot on location whenever possible and picked Washington, D.C. because it is the centre of power in the United States.

1588279,2,B00005JPUN,"This is a sort of swashbuckling romp through a story told in film and television on several occasions as noted by most reviewers.

Kidman and Craig do an OK job as the central characters and there is a modicum of suspense throughout the movie.

It did not take long for the gaps in the plot and the inconsistencies to show through but it was entertaining enough for my fourteen year old to sit through until the end.

Good idea, gone wrong. Too superficial, probably just made it into maximum viewer attention span of about 100 minutes and about as interesting as the remake of Stepford Wives. Hang on. Kidman was in that too. These movies must remind her of her ex-hubby.

I would rather watch this than the election coverage but it is hard to choose between the two and I would rather not watch the elction coverage although Hilary and Obama remind me of Kidman and Craig.

1588280,3,B00005JPUN,"You got to give this movie some credit for not being a direct scene by scene remake of the previous adaptations. For those who have seen recent remakes the majority of them rely on creating a pretty much scene by scene remake. Such movies include The Omen, Psycho, and The Amityville Horror.

 Anyway the invasion is not a bad movie it's just that it had so much to offer that the creators couldn't decide what to do with it. Also this movie had a troubled production; originally set to be released in 2006 the movie would go through a lot of rewrites and re shoots. From what I heard the movie was going to originally have a twist ending, but it seems that it did not qualify with the studios demands. The Wachowski brothers were also hired to rewrite the initial script; aswell the director of V For Vendetta James McTeigue was  brought in to re shoot a more action ere film. The result of course is a mish mash of ideas put into one movie.

 The movie begins with what seems to be the end of the film (don't worry i won't ruin anything important) the film later jumps into a scene where a NASA space craft crash lands with a alien life inside; if exposed to it the individual gets infected, the symptoms begin in REM sleep, the infected become a type of cocoon. As soon as they wake up they recollect the past memories of the host. Basically they seem human, look human, but they are not. The infected show no emotions. The ones who are not infected use this as an advantage to hide from them.

 Anyway the movies central plot is pretty good it even has some edge of your seat moments. But unfortunately the creators just didn't know how to correctly develop the plot, and it shows. Such as the ending which is a complete letdown, the writers just didn't know what to do so they just ran the credits and called it an ending. Don't get me wrong the movie is good to watch once, it's just that there aren't any real surprises. it all feels very similar and formulaic.  honestly it's worth to rent and to watch once.

1588282,5,B00005JPUN,"Someone must defend the exquisite ""The Invasion"", which was a huge critical and commercial disaster when released in 2007. Personally, I think it was way ahead of its' time, and it is quite ironic that most people are waking up to its' genius on DVD.

Nicole Kidman, in perhaps her most restrained performance plays 'a woman against the world'. Holding onto her sanity while the rest of the world around her are converted literally into zombies, she plays a simple woman who has to deal with some extraordinary circumstances. I found her insomniac performance while teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown while trapped in the convenience store, to be one of her greatest screen moments.

Its moments like that which define ""The Invasion"". This is NOT a film for special effects afficionados. In fact, I can't recall even one significant special effect or 'things blowing up'. What I got instead was a quiet, intelligent science fiction thriller that relied upon dialog and languid camera movement to convey a sense of fear and mayhem. In fact, the Directors' style here is an amalgamation of David Lynch and two of his best movies - ""Dune"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". The film-noir vibe is stark throughout this film, and I would say this is closer to an art film that a typical commercial thriller.

Perhaps its that sensibility that made this a commercial failure. In one extended sequence, Nicole Kidman is informed that in order to escape being noticed by the zombies, you need to be 'emotionless'. Nicole then proceeds to take the train and walk the streets, and does a fine job of conveying nothingness, simply to escape being killed, while all the while her character is dying inside. Superb.

The end could have been better, yes, and in fact even I was surprised at how conveniently they wrapped things up just to finish the film off. But thats a minor quibble. I preferred this vastly over last years ""Children of Men"", which I would call ""The Invasion""'s poorer cousin. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend the negativity this film attracts when in fact its certainly a science fiction classic and clearly the best film made on the Invasion theme so far.

There is a film from 1994 - ""Body Snatchers"", which had the same storyline. That was another minor masterpiece that no one noticed (try looking for the DVD, it starred Gabrielle Anwar in her defining role). Its unsung movies like these that are present in the science fiction genre, and true fans of the medium such as myself will always be there to give them the respect they deserve.

Ignore the negativity, and BUY this on DVD today. Its certainly worth watching more than once, and will quickly become one of your favorite movies if you give it a chance.

I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.

Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a ""glorified zombie movie"" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a ""Zombie"" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected. That said however, there is just something about the way they move, the way they don't require nourishment, and just walk around mindlessly infecting others with their alien virus that makes them very zombie like. They're not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a>&nbsp;zombies, and they're not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;zombies either; these binges are a completely new sort of zombie, sort of the Stephen King zombie for those of you who've read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cell-A-Novel/dp/1416524517/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cell: A Novel</a>.

Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. we start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. Their smiling too much, their too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. at first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.

The real horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.

And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for our aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and infected.

The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.

EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near as good as the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.

The characters do things that require a stretch of the imagination to justify but that is what movies are for - to escape from reality.  Good movie.  Too bad the professional reviewers are so prejudice against any movie that is not about real life death or sorrow, or is an ""artistic"" model.",1197417600,3,397,4.563380281690141
1588287,2,B00005JPUN,"This latest in the remake of the Body Snatchers theme is every bit as watered down and pointless as I'd been led to believe.  But I'm a die-hard zombie buff, a fan of movies that portray a world where mindless conformity is the real villain, and I couldn't stop myself from popping a copy in and sitting back to watch the devastation.

For a story with so much symbolic possibility, ""The Invasion"" is surprisingly hollow.  Impatient to get to the creepy scenes where whole hordes of people stand emotionlessly on street corners, where crowds stare impassionately as ""real"" humans are dragged screaming into dark alleys and cop cars, the movie hustles the plot through the necessary set-up and straight into the gooey guts beyond.  You're not fifteen minutes into the film before a psychiatrist (Nicole Kidman, who is so distantly cold in the film, she seems like one of ""them"" long before anyone even knows ""them"" is a threat) is listening to a patient shakily describe her husband as ""not my husband anymore.""  A little on the nose, don't you think?

This kind of pushy terror doesn't really work so well, especially when what depth the movie does manage to muster is so awkward.  On the threshhold of the climax, Kidman's psychiatrist attends a fancy dinner and listens as several elderly men discuss politics and sociology.  A Russian fellow sitting next to her adamantly points out that being violent and illogical is what makes us human, and therefore should be embraced.  He might as well be wearing a name tag that says ""HELLO!  I Am The Movie's Moral Mouthpiece.""

And a weird moral it is.  After ""them"" inveigles its way into brains of most of the world, the televisions are aglow with reports of peace accords across the globe.  Old feuds are finally abolished, weapons are dismantled, walls are torn down.  Can't we all just get along?  Sure!  If we're all infected with the same mind-altering space-bug.  But we're not SUPPOSED to get along, you see, and that's why a world of mindless conformity is weird and wrong.  Right?  Right?  Someone please tell me if I'm right.

The most pointed part of the story involves a rather silly twist about how the space-virus finally takes effect.  You can get the microbe inside of you, but you don't turn into one of ""them"" until you fall asleep.  Kidman's psychiatrist spends much of the movie trying to stay awake, desperately afraid that she'll nod off at any moment and then wake up someone else.  It's a neat little metaphor for our own world (the movie's way of saying ""Wake up, people!"") but it's also just as heavy-handed as anything else.  Ultimately, it becomes a sad command for the audience who, by the final neat-n-tidy scenes, may find themselves struggling to stay awake and wondering why they should.",1194307200,,2767,4.774736842105263
1588288,2,B00005JPUN,"Jack Finney's famous story, which is the basis of Don Siegel's classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" is remade again with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Considering the names involved in this new project, including German director Oliver Hirschbiegel known for his outstanding ""Downfall"" and ""The Experiment,"" the 2007 version should be a great thriller - the producers must have thought so, and so did I.

Nicole Kidman is Carol Bennell who realizes that something weird is going on in the city of Washington DC where she works as psychiatrist. For the reasons that I should not reveal here, Carol knows she should not sleep in order to protect her beloved son Oliver from ""them,"" but I think you know the original story. Sorry, but this is the only part I was intrigued during the film. Oh, but I like the ""vomits"" part, though.

Unfortunately the newest version misses every chance to be a good if not better adaptation of the great story. This time it is set in a bigger city and the film also (rather unnecessarily) touches the subjects like a tragic space shuttle accident, but the film moves on with a hectic speed without fully developing the meaning of the new settings. An interesting ""What if"" scenario is certainly there - are we still happy when we stop hearing any more news of war and terrorism in this way?

However, the story is more ""rushed"" than ""slick,"" going from one scene to another without taking time to building up the atmosphere of impeding dangers, so the results are boring (and familiar devices like barking dogs and nods to older versions including Veronica Cartwright's character do not help much). What is worse (for me) is the concluding chapters where Nicole Kidman's character is seen driving a car madly like Kurt Russell in ""Grindhouse."" The stunts themselves are great like any other Joel Silver films, but I expected to see something entirely different.

But perhaps that is the way Oliver Hirschbiegel may be feeling about the film, which, according to IMDb, went through re-shooting. We may be able to see another and hopefully better version of the film and until then, two stars.",1193875200,2,2128,4.837912087912088
