8241248,5,B0011B9W24,"I've been a Roland Martin fan for years. If you like to watch someone catch big fish, Roland does it and shows you how you can too.
Never gets old watching Roland catch fish.",1416787200,,174,4.147058823529412

We used to get up on Saturday Mornings and watch fishing shows
This was a great way for us to relive some of that, When fishing was still wholesome.",1370390400,,202,4.075

8241253,5,B0011B9W24,$7 for over 500 minutes and 23 shows is a good deal to me - especially if you simply enjoy watching fishing shows. Sure there's a good deal of commercialization but that's to be expected with fishing shows when these guys make their living from sponsors. It doesn't take away from the entertainment. Watching Roland Martin fish in some great locations is fun to me and I think it's worth every penny.,1265587200,2,400,4.569444444444445
8241254,1,B0011B9W24,"I searched in Amazon for instructional video for fly fishing-anglers. This is what I wound up with. # 1, it's not instructional, other than you can watch & learn from another's triumphs & mistakes. From bumper to bumper, it's a commercial, from boat to gear, what they wear, what they think. Each program is just like the last, maybe a different boat, different gear. I wouldn't have accepted it free, if I could have previewed first.",1251244800,,434,4.723684210526316
