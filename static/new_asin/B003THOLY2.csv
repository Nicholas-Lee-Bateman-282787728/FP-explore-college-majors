8405096,5,B003THOLY2,"This is a must see film!  I was lucky enough to view this at the Westtown School with a group of diverse Upper School students and staff.  We were all deeply moved and the movie resonated deep within many of our hearts; in somewhat unexpected ways.  It is an incredibly powerful story of trauma, loss, grief, reslience, and love.  It offers a very strong history of the holocaust in the Ukraine, but also deeply explores the long term impact of trauma and grief on the human mind.  This film also offers a powerful window into the legacy of loss carried by many Jews today and the multigenerational impact of the holocaust on so many families.  It is an incredible protrait of the deep impact of trauma and traumatic grief on individuals and families.  I plan to use this video to explore the impact of loss and trauma in my graduate social work and contiuing education classes.  It is a wonderful jumping off point for a discussion about trauma and grief in families.  A wonderful teaching tool indeed!  I hope many more people will view this movie and share it with others!  I can't thank Howard Reich and his mother enough for sharing this incredible story with the world!  The world is a better place for it!  Thank you!",1360022400,2,1224,4.559633027522936
8405097,5,B003THOLY2,"Howard Reich beautifully tells the story of the present day struggles his mother faces due to the trauma she endured as a child during the Holocaust. This film is not centered around the Holocaust and is not presented as a sad tale of a Holocaust survivor, but rather the story unfolds as an informative lesson detailing what can happen when childhood trauma is not properly looked after. This couldn't be a more important lesson during the trying times our children are currently facing, whether it is being homeless due to a bad economy or the ills of natural disaster.  I would recommend this film to anyone interested in learning more about post-traumatic stress disorder or anyone interested in the mental and emotional well-being of a struggling child. The story is told with conviction and emotion and was a pleasure to watch!",1290988800,5,833,4.907801418439717
8405098,5,B003THOLY2,"Compassionate, artful telling of Sonia, a strong woman who is a mother, grandmother and a Holocaust survivor, from the perspective of her son, Howard Reich. The film includes lessons for all of us about post traumatic stress disorder, mental health diagnosis and treatment, the impact of war, aging, nursing care, the importance of family and community relationships, the strength of the human spirit and more. Another fine documentary from Kartemquin Films. Worth seeing again if possible at screenings when Howard Reich and Gordon Quinn, Artistic Director and founding member of Kartemquin Films, are present for discussion.",1285632000,3,626,5.53125
8405099,5,B003THOLY2,Prisoner of her Past is not a film - it is a journey. Howard Reich's exploration of his mother's background and the onset of her illness leads to the exploration of a family and life he never knew. This incredibly personal look into late onset Post Traumatic Stress disorder is a wake-up call: memories and experiences can physically haunt us even decades later. Kudos to Kartemquin for once again making a fantastic documentary!,1277856000,6,429,4.890410958904109
