4990512,5,B006HLZF2Y,"I have attended Jill's in-person classes for years and recently had to take some time off due to my work and ""mommy"" schedule. I absolutely LOVE waking up to do the ""Done In One"" video with Jill. She always gives encouraging direction on how to correctly use a set of weights and how to really get your heart pumping to produce results. I also take the time to read her mytrainerjill.com blog each day to learn tips on better nutrition (with a ton of inspiration weaved into each message).",1323129600,,489,4.50561797752809
4990513,5,B006HLZF2Y,"I just started using Jill's workout and love it. After a long day at work, I can come home and get a complete workout without going to a gym. Just after three sessions, I feel I am getting stronger, especially my upper body strength. Not bad for a 58 yr old. I challenge all who are thinking of buying this to give it a try!!",1323129600,,325,4.015384615384615
4990514,5,B006HLZF2Y,This video is great for anyone who wants a great workout in a small amount of time.  This takes the guess work out of working out.  The whole body gets addressed and you get a full body workout.  I was able to follow the movements easily the first time I tried the video.  That is more than I can say for some other workout videos that I had to watch multiple times before I could actually do the movements.  I love this video!,1323129600,,427,4.096385542168675
4990515,5,B006HLZF2Y,"The perfect complete workout!  I love the variety of cardio combined with strength training that challenges you each and every time.  The exercises are easy to follow and adapt to all abiliities.  This is an intense, productive video that empowers you mentally and physically.",1322956800,,276,5.2272727272727275
8498573,5,B006HLZF2Y,"Tough, but extremely efficient in helping me work out my entire body in 1 hour. Sometimes I will do just a few segments at a time if I don't have time to do the whole video. I'll go back the next time and finish where I left off. It offers a great variety to my running work out, weight lifting, and fitness center classes. If you want to feel muscles that you didn't know that you have and  challenge yourself, do this workout. I bought one for my mom and sister too!",1325721600,,468,4.086956521739131
8498574,5,B006HLZF2Y,"I'm a runner, but have had two knee surgeries. Therefore, it's critical that I do strength training to keep from reinjuring my knee. Jill's workout has made all the difference. I do it once a week and haven't had any knee issues. You feel so wiped after doing it, even if you aren't able to do the whole thing. I love that she does the workout with you, yet also keeps you thinking about key form. Before, when I'd lift weights or try my own circuit training at my house (or a gym), I never pushed myself to do such a thorough workout.",1323734400,,535,4.203883495145631
8498575,5,B006HLZF2Y,"I absolutely agree with the rest of the reviewers. Done In One is a fun, challenging workout. Jill doesn't move too fast that it is difficult to keep up but changes things up quickly enough so you don't get bored. I have done many, many exercise videos since moving to a small town without a gym almost 10 years ago and I must say that eventually, Barry, Shaun T and Jillian leave you wanting more... now I've found it!",1323648000,,419,4.3164556962025316
8498576,5,B006HLZF2Y,"Done in One is a GREAT workout and I HIGHLY recommend this video to others.  Why?  Because it is like having a personal trainer come to my house every morning...I love that it is all done with one set of dumb bells and I don't have to invest in all kinds of other expensive equipment to get an effective work out in.  It includes both cardio and strenth training in one work out, which is great for me because I am a busy person and don't always find time to do both.  Also, it is s set up in a way that you can tailor it to your individual fitness level and still get an amazing work out!  Simply put, this video is AWESOME!",1323648000,,625,4.008064516129032
8498577,5,B006HLZF2Y,This video is challenging and a great workout.  You will work up a sweat while toning the whole body in only an hour.  This video has helped me take off my baby weight while the kiddos are sleeping.  Perfect for those who want a good workout and can't make it to the gym.,1323561600,,271,4.0754716981132075
8498578,5,B006HLZF2Y,"This is a rewarding workout if you can last through it! However, I can choose chapters if i wanted a shorter/easier workout. The setting is pretty to look at and Jill is easy to follow. I would recommend this workout!",1323216000,,217,4.45
8498579,5,B006HLZF2Y,"This is an awesome, super efficient strength training workout that targets your whole body in just one hour! You WILL sweat and be sore for a couple days to follow. Jill cues well and does a great job with modification for different levels of fitness. Great value for the price! Highly recommended!",1323216000,,298,4.75
8498580,5,B006HLZF2Y,I've tried so many different workout videos but just couldn't get a great workout at home...until now! I am a new mom so being able to get a quick workout in during nap time is critical. Done in One is awesome and the hardest hour I've ever spent working out a home. I didn't even know I could sweat so much without a gym. And my body is even better than before kids...thanks Jill!,1323216000,,381,4.162162162162162
8498581,5,B006HLZF2Y,"This workout is incredible!  It is perfect for days I can't make it to the gym and the hour goes by so fast.  This high intensity class incorporates power moves along with cardio & strength training to improve your fitness.  Jill does a great job of explaining the exercises and giving modifications for each exercise.  If you want to be driven and challenged, this is the workout for you!!!!  Try it - you will be glad you did.",1323129600,,428,4.435897435897436
