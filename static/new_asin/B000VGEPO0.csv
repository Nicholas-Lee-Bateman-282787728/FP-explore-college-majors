8218605,4,B000VGEPO0,"I bought this DVD set because the audio offers Spanish language. Moreover, it is Latin american Spanish, exactly the same translation I heard about 1977 on Argentina's TV. Image quality is fine, not HD but OK for a 35 years old TV series. Offered audio languages are English and Spanish, but not subtitles at all. The box set assures the subtitles (English and Spanish) are included, but it's a lie. Not a problem to me, but someone may be dissapointed.

A really nice piece of history. Looking forward for the release of seasons 2 & 3 in Spanish language. Can't wait for them!",1313020800,,577,4.601941747572815
8218606,3,B000VGEPO0,"Even though it is stated on the outside of the box that the DVD has subtitles, it DOES NOT. You can pick the spoken language between English and Spanish, but there are NO SUBTITLES available. This was a huge disappointment to me, being that the only reason I bought this version was for the subtitles. So, if that is why you're buying this, DON'T!",1285113600,3,347,4.4375
8218607,1,B000VGEPO0,The picture quality is poor...wait for this to be released in the states (if it ever is).,1250985600,2,89,4.294117647058823
8218608,5,B000VGEPO0,"This is a real original TV show not a fake but the only problem is one of the show instead of speaking English, it didn't and it only speak in Spanish.  However I guess this is call not a perfect world.  Afterward I bought another set but it is retape not original and the image are very very poor.  Especially when you put it on a 60inches big screen TV.",1215388800,3,355,4.042857142857143
