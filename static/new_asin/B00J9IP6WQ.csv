8649003,5,B00J9IP6WQ,"I remember reading about Severing Crime Edge a while back and thinking that the premise looked interesting, but life got busy, and I forgot about it. After finishing the amazing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Future-Diary/dp/B00CU6WB5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Future Diary</a>, I was desperate to find something in a similar vein. I remembered SCE and started watching it with moderate expectations. When the ending of the first freaking episode made me tear up, I knew I had found something incredible.

SCE tells the story of Kiri, Iwai, and two curses that overshadow them both. Iwai is a reclusive girl whose cursed hair can never be cut. Kiri is a kind but strange guy with a near-fetish for cutting beautiful hair, and when he meets Iwai, he discovers in her an object of pity, a holy grail of barbering, and possibly a love interest. He can't find a way to help her, though, until she reveals to him that the family heirloom scissors he carries around are a special class of item called ""Killing Goods"": weapons formerly owned by serial killers that give their wielders deadly powers. Sensing an opportunity to use the shears in the service of good, Kiri tests them against Iwai's cursed hair and frees her for the first time in years. This should cue ""happy ending,"" but it turns out to be only an ominous beginning. There are other Killing Goods out there, and a rumor is going around that whoever kills ""the Queen of Hair"" (i.e. Iwai) will be granted a single wish... Things are about to get hairy.

Severing Crime Edge is a standout anime for doing a number of things so well. For one, it's a beautiful show, with gorgeous coloring, artistic ""camera angles"" to vary the scenes, and smooth animation. The music also complements the action perfectly, especially in touching or surreal moments. It also boasts a likeable cast, and it pursues the concepts it introduces in fascinating directions. For example, the wielders of the ""Killing Goods"" are tragic figures as much as they are villains. We discover that the weapons gradually degrade their owner's souls until they are just as psychotic as the original killers unless they can find some sort of non-lethal outlet for their bloodlust. It makes you pity the villains and worry about Kiri. Will using his scissors to protect Iwai corrupt him in the long run? The story and drama are extremely compelling.

With all that said, in perfect fairness, this anime does fall short in some areas. Its pacing is strangely uneven at times, and we are sometimes teased by fascinating characters that get introduced only to never be seen again. The reason for this is that these 13 episodes only tell half the story contained in the manga. The producers are obviously hoping for a second season - without spoiling anything, the final episode closes its little arc with a huge plot twist and teaser images of what future episodes will (hopefully) hold. Sentai Filmworks' blu-ray/DVD product is also a bit of a no-frills affair. Don't expect much beyond scene selection, and this anime unfortunately got the ""subbed-only"" treatment and includes no English audio track at the present.

Despite these small pitfalls, I still consider Severing Crime Edge a five-star anime and am reviewing it accordingly. This anime manages to be in turns heartwarming, twisted, terrifying, weirdly sexual, and refreshingly innocent. The result is a beauty of a cult favorite that's a cut above the rest. I'm rooting for the Japanese animators and hope they get their second season. I also hope Sentai Filmworks eventually gives the US audience a dubbed re-release... throw in a soundtrack, and you'll have me at ""hello.""

Strongly recommended, and not by a hair.",1417910400,7,3739,5.063311688311688

8649005,5,B00J9IP6WQ,"This is a very dark series that never seems to have a calm period that isn't just before a storm. It  involves middle-school kids that are both cursed by their ancestors and the articles inherited from them, called Killing Goods, that the ancestors used to commit murders in the most foul of methods.
The story revolves around the Queen of Hair, a cute, petit girl named Iwai that is cursed with hair that cannot be cut causing her to be shut in a mansion and away from others that bully her for it. Her curse is further complicated by the legend that anyone that kills her will have their wish granted, even if that wish defies the very laws of nature.  Her long-dead father was working on a solution for the curse but, as the story unfolds, he created even more problems for her with possible solutions to them in the following series planned.
The story begins when a boy of the same age named Kiri gets off the bus at the wrong stop and ends up outside her greenhouse, staring at her long hair; unknown to him, his life-long obsession with cutting hair with a very old pair of serrated hair scissors comes from his never-knew-of ancestor and famed mass murder named Grayland, so famous that a movie was made of him and his crimes. Users of Killing Goods are called Authors.
Another Author that you may creep you out early in the first episode is the younger half of a fraternal twin pair named Byouinzaka who uses the hypodermic syringe used by her ancestor, a military nurse, to kill patients. Her sister, opposite in virtually every respect....maybe....calls her sister socially  clumsy, the understatement of the series. Don't write her off too soon as she is of more value that one may first think.
There is a person called the Professor that is Iwai's guardian, a upper-society level group called Gossip that gets their thrills watching murders happen live on stage while they snack on bree and drink snooty-priced wines, and many other Authors trying to get their wishes granted by killing Iwai.
Although a dark and tense series, it is well done even if the character designs are only above average. Well recommended with 4-and-one-half Stars.",1398297600,16,2152,4.6878306878306875
