8347676,3,B001XRLX4Q,"Written and directed by Brian Helgeland (A Knight's Tale, L.A. Confidential) and adapted from the book by John Pearson (The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins), Legend is a film about the notorious Reggie and Ronnie Kray, twin brothers who came to dominate organized crime in London of the 1950's and 60's.

The film begins somewhere in the early 1960's when Reggie and Ronnie Kray (both played by Tom Hardy in a bravura double performance) were already established gangsters in London's East End but not yet the heads of organized crime they were to become. Reggie's main rivals are the Richardson brothers, but before he can deal with them he has to get his brother Ronnie out of a psychiatric hospital where he's been confined for his violent behavior. At the same time, he begins a relationship with a girl named Frances (Emily Browning), the younger sister of one of his henchmen, Frank Shea (Colin Morgan). When Reggie succeeds in getting Ronnie's release over the deep misgivings of the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Humphries (Nicholas Farrell), Humphries takes Reggie aside and warns him ""Your brother Ron is violent and psychopathic and I suspect he's paranoid schizophrenic... to put it simply he's off his f[***]ing rocker!"". He then hands Reggie a bottle of pills and desperately urges him ""Make sure he takes these... or there'll be serious trouble!""

We soon see why Reggie wanted Ronnie free before confronting the Richardsons. Ronnie may be crazy, but he's absolutely fearless and capable of dishing out extreme violence in abundance, ""a one-man mob"" as Frances puts it in her narration. Not that Reggie is any slouch in that department. He's more polished and controlled - and certainly more sane - but beneath that surface he's just as capable of dealing out brutal violence as Ronnie.

But as impressive as Hardy's performances are, the film itself is decidedly uneven, particularly in the focus and the pacing, and as a bio-pic it falls short both in terms of the accuracy of the events it depicts and in some of the chronology. No effort is made to bring out any of the Kray's upbringing, or their early budding careers as boxers, or their telling experience in national service which was an early indicator of where they were heading in life. And no effort is made to give any perspective on the real nature - let alone extent - of their criminal organization, The Firm, how they made their money, and the grip it had on the London criminal scene.

It also fails to make good use of some of the other fine actors in the film. Christopher Eccleston (Doctor Who, Heroes, Elizabeth)'s Detective ""Nipper"" Read, is given very little to do except to give reaction shots and deliver stock lines like ""We're going after the Krays."" Paul Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, Master and Commander, A Knight's Tale) is all but invisible as Kray rival Charlie Richardson. Chazz Palminteri (Bullets over Broadway, The Usual Suspects) comes across as flat and half-there in his two brief scenes as the American Mafioso Angelo Bruno who partners up with the Krays. Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Testament of Youth) has maybe four lines and a few knowing smirks and manic giggles as Edward ""Mad Teddy"" Smith, one of Ronnie Kray's gangster cronies who was, like him, gay and more than a bit mental. In truth, about the only other actor who gets any decent screen-time and dialogue is David Thewlis (The Theory of Everything, various Harry Potter films) as Leslie Payne, the Kray's business manager and fixer/arranger for their clubs and more legitimate dealings. Emily Browning (Sucker Punch, The Uninvited), however, is lumbered by being made something of an questionable narrator of events as Frances Shea, Reggie's girlfriend and later wife, and while given a lot of exposition to relate, is never really developed as a believable character.

It's a pity that Helgeland didn't follow Pearson's book more closely, not only for accuracy and perspective but also because there are a lot of anecdotes about the Krays that would've made for great scenes and a much better film.  If you really want to get a handle on who the Krays were and what they were like, I strongly recommend Pearson's book.

Recommended for Tom Hardy's impressive double performance as both Reggie and Ronnie Kray, but something of a mixed bag otherwise.",1451779200,,4360,4.923809523809524
8347677,5,B001XRLX4Q,"A career best performance for Tom Hardy.. Absolutely electrifying acting..

The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.

You don't need to be a fan of the Krays story or gangster movies to absolutely love this movie (but it helps of course) this is a fascinating story and a great insight into these iconic villains from the 60's, the movie has a stunning cast all round, Emily Browning is absolutely beautiful and a fantastic young actress, Christopher Eccleston plays police head of the investigation into the Krays, but no doubt Tom Hardy steals every moment of this movie with his electric performance of both the Kray twins, such a fine star in probably his greatest role yet, he lights up the screen with so much life to both these characters making them unique like we have never seen them before, very entertaining for all the wrong reasons of course, these were bad men doing bad things, the movie is very violent at times, very funny all the time, great memorable dialogue, its very Tarantino now and again, this is one of the best movies of 2015 for sure, a must see, powerful performances from a stunning cast alone make this essential viewing! The movie has amazing effects, having two Toms must have been a long process but it was worth it, the 60's settings look very authentic and the soundtrack is great too, you cant go wrong!

Running time 2 hours 11 minutes
Rated 18 for very strong language, strong violence.",1451174400,2,1599,4.703571428571428
8347678,4,B001XRLX4Q,"Just about every Guy Ritchie gangster movie you have seen (Snatch, Lock Stock 2 Barrels) are all basically inspired by real life 1960's era London criminals the Kray brothers. Nothing wrong with that, just stating for American audiences what is obvious to those who live overseas. There has already been a movie (1990's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Krays-Region-2/dp/B00004R78K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Krays [Region 2</a>]), which for some reason was fairly common on VHS but not DVD, and on top of that more documentaries than you can shake a proverbial billy club at.

This incarnation, Legend, will be best known for Tom Hardy's (the frenchman from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZG981E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception (Blu-ray)</a>) performance, because through the wonder of new fangled gee whiz technology he manages to convincingly play both twin brothers.  Having seen the 1990's Krays,played by Spandeau Ballet's Kemp brothers, it took some getting used to. For those being exposed to the Krays for the first time, I am guessing he does a bang-up job and for a lot of people will be the main reason for seeing the movie.

The film is about 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4 because of his performance. Yes, it's a period piece, and for those without an ear for the King's English it can be a little hard to understand at times.  No fault there however, it's a British film afterall. Also stars Emily Browning (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lemony-Snicket-s-A-Series-Of-Unfortunate-Events-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B00KBCN0RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events (BD) [Blu-ray</a>]) as the wife of one of the Krays, who plays what turns out to be a significant role rather very well. This is a gangland movie, but at its core revolves around the complicated relationship of the twin brothers, both influenced (poorly) by their mum with all sorts of family issues, one who gets married and the other gay, and both trying to guide and/or not follow the other because of various motivations.  Not liking a twin can certainly be frustrating when one also sees an ugly version of ones self on the other side of the mirror. The loyalty/hate relationship of all brothers, magnified by the ugly world they had both foisted upon them but also further created.

It is obvious that the director (Peter Helgeland) loved this movie and the subject matter with his attention to detail, but the film is still a bit uneven. Having watched both Mel Gibson's ""Payback"" and Helgeland's version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback-The-Director-s-Cut-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000M3439O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback - The Director's Cut (Special Collector's Edition)</a>), it is evident that he dislikes making ""standard"" crime movies, and likes the anti-hero (or in this case, just two repulsive twin criminals), which viewers will either hate or love. There is not a lot of romantacizing here, which is a good thing.

No spoilers, but if you are looking for a parallel this will seem like a British version of Depp's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BLACK-MASS-DVD/dp/B015JR14FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BLACK MASS (DVD)</a>&nbsp;from a pure ""subject matter"" standpoint. Legend, with its family relationships, is also (somewhat) less violent (only by comparison) and a little more complex.  1990's ""The Krays"" is the better of the two, but they are different enough, a lot of time has passed between them, and Hardy's performance is well worth watching.",1449360000,4,3740,6.110476190476191

I guess that and the fact that its a unauthorized documentary should have been enough writing on the wall, however this is not even a documentary - this DVD is two interviews, that's it. The first is decent in length but nothing interesting comes out of it and I think the interviewer kissed Nas' a** a little too much. The second is a short Hot 97 interview.
