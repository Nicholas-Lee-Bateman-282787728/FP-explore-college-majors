While there is a real interest in seeing how this series ends, it has failed to leave a lasting impression and leads me to think that perhaps it's time for this series to finally sink into the murky depths. Recommended if you're bored but with only one volume remaining, this series is very quickly running out of time to sell me.",1213833600,2,441,4.525
