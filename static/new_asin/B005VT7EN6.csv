8487581,3,B005VT7EN6,"For those who might have bought some products under the Gaiam brand by ""Katy Santiago M.S."", as I have done in the past, you might want to know that Katy Bowman M.S. and Katy Santiago M.S. and Katy Santiago Bowman M.S. appear to be the same person. This is to imply nothing about the quality of the products by her under any of those names or under any of the brands under which she has produced products, but it might help people avoid duplicating purchases. It would have been a matter of full disclosure and integrity, I think, to have revealed that those names all belong to the same person and to perhaps indicate where products are identical or where they are different. The Gaiam brand produced kits including DVDs by Katy Santiago M.S. for spinal alignment and for feet problems and for strong bones.  Similar DVDs are now for sale on Amazon under the Aligned and Well brand. Whether they are the same DVD content or not, I do not know.  Maybe somebody who does know can comment here to help us all out. I regret rating this item at all because I am not really rating this product but am alerting customers to this information.",1323734400,4,1135,4.478260869565218
