8163132,5,B000LPQ6AW,Beautifully done!  the characters all show a side of themselves we have yet to see and the ending is perfect for this season!  Val ghost is powerfull but with a fault that is shown in this last disc of the season.  it is also a stunning visual experiance as the worlds are expanded and space is ripped apart.  Please pick this up you will enjoy it!  I surely did.,1188259200,2,363,4.202898550724638
