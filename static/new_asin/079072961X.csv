115996,4,079072961X,"Spoiler review:

The Marshall is kind of a lunatic.  Opening fire in the train station was pretty ludicrous on top of his last incident. Awesome film though, I've never got sick of it over 20 years, I want to watch it again.

I try not to over context it.  Pretty amazing mystery film and the melodrama is well played, great acting.

I couldn't decide if whether Kimble should have surrendered initially after the wreck or tried to solve the murder.",1514505600,,449,4.5625

116000,5,079072961X,"yet this is among my top ten movie choices.  Perhaps because the many characters are so interesting.  Just wonderfully acted, directed and edited: wonderful characters, humor, excitement and well-paced.  The relationship between the two principals is interesting to watch - they each are working with passion for their opposing goals, and the last scene is wonderful.  The music also fits and is not over done.  Since I sometimes watch movies to escape, the fantasy ending is ok too.",1510963200,,483,5.141025641025641

116117,5,079072961X,"This movie just does everything right. Harrison Ford perfectly playing the wrongly accused hero, Tommy Lee Jones as the tireless pursuer, and a fantastic story, perfect pacing, engaging soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography and Chicago scenery. I never get tired of this film and the countless ""Oh no!"" moments that you think mean the end for the hero. What's so compelling is how Harrison Ford plays a completely believable protagonist. Unlike the sillier Bourne-style films, here's a hero that mourns his loss, that wearily crawls from cold water, that sadly walks alone into a dark tunnel with the rumbling of thunder, that panics as he came so close to a capture at the rental home, etc, and you really feel for him, for his loss and his loneliness. Harrison Ford just nails this role perfectly. Paired with the cool, tireless Tommy Lee Jones, who never gives and inch, and you've just got one of the most enjoyable, re-watchable films ever.",1499385600,,946,4.955974842767295

116119,5,079072961X,"Sadly this style of movie is dead in the water now.  A great Sunday night movie to end the week with. You can't beat on location scenery. Not my favorite film of all time but it's a movie with a good actors, story and directing principles so it still holds up. It's not about how many CGI explosions they can throw in like we'd get today. Today the train wreck would be ten minutes long with massive green screen effects and spectacle that goes on and on until your eyes are sore. The 90's saw the last of these types of quality films.",1498176000,,535,4.194174757281553

I purchased this DVD back in 2011, but it got damaged by one of my mother's dogs, chewed the disc all up and bought it again today and now waiting for it to get to me.

116197,4,079072961X,"I have often noted in doing reviews of older movies that they can provide a glimpse in the mores, the ethos, the fads of their times. Usually that glimpse involves certain customs, or certain ways of life portrayed on the screen. As a rule though they generally, at least the films that I watch deal with the state of the art in crime detection, the detection of murder one, murder most foul, murder which as a capital crime in some states (and at the federal level) mean the death penalty. So I took the action thriller under review, The Fugitive, based on the long running television series starring David Jansen  which in turn was based on the murder conviction of Doctor Samuel Shepard back in the 1950s as such an example.

No way today, even give the liberal cinematic license allowed in action thrillers, or any film, that our protagonist, Doctor Richard Kimble played by the versatile action actor Harrison Ford find himself accused of the murder of his wife, played by Sela Ward. Or wrongly as it turned out convicted. No way either that with DNA sampling available and since the scenario of this film is set in Chicago with the Innocent Project started at nearby Northwestern University would Kimble be facing the big step-off, the sting of a lethal injection.

That is now though but we have to backtrack to the time of crime (or of the film) and realize that some pretty sloppy police work let our good Doctor through the cracks of the justice system. Let him face the big step-off just because the coppers would not believe his story about his wife Helen, played by Sela Ward, being brutally murdered by a one-armed intruder, a home invader with some dastardly purpose in mind. So Kimble was forced to take steps on his own, had to seek out the real killer and bring him to justice. That task was fortuitously aided by an attempted escape by a couple of prisoners going to the same place as Kimble and wouldnt you know the an on-coming crashed into the bus and it flew over an embankment freeing our man to seek the righteous justice he deserves.

That search for the real killer might have been a somewhat interesting story but the action would have been minimal. The film then turned into an odd-ball buddy film as Marshal Earp, oops, Marshal Gerard, played by Tommy Lee Jones was determined to bring this hardened felon to justice or at least to the clink. The chase in on. And through the bulk of the film Kimble is one, maybe two, steps ahead of the vengeful marshal and his all-out massive posse of federal, state, local, and hell, county law enforcement agencies, leading him a merry chase down waterfalls, on the El, in and out of hospitals (which he worked to his advantage like a charm), hotels, rooming houses you name it. But our good doctor sought the murderer, that damn one-armed bandit, and what drove him to the heinous crime. You know in the end Kimble will be exonerated but it was a wild trip all the same. Still I am glad they have DNA testing at their fingertips today, very glad.",1487030400,,3015,4.567467652495379

116302,5,079072961X,"The Fugitive, 1994 film

The film opens with a woman being attacked; it is the wife of Dr. Richard Kimble. The police take the husband in for questioning. They had been at an event, and Dr. Kimble was called to the hospital, leaving his wife alone. There was an attack by a one-armed man; his wifes death leaves him rich. Dr. Kimble is convicted for her murder and sentenced to death. (This is based on the 1960s TV series.) The surprise in this movie is not in the ending, but the events that lead to the ending. The legend of a surgeon wrongly convicted is based on the real case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. As an action suspense story, this is excellent! [It is set in the Chicago area, perhaps because Cleveland would have no part of this story.]

Deputy Marshal Gerard shows up to personally take over the investigation, and search for the fugitive. Dr. Kimbles escape in cold weather reminds me of the similar escape of Rambo. Dr. Kimble hides in the urban jungle. The pacing keeps the fugitive one jump ahead of his pursuers. When he is trapped in the tunnel, Dr. Kimble goes underground (literally). Gerard is relentless for a man who doesnt care. Dr. Kimble escapes with a desperate leap into the air. We then follow Dr. Kimble as he attempts to search for the real killer, like in a detective story. There is exciting action until the final minutes when Justice triumphs.

This story was updated to reflect the business world of the 1990s, and its many scandals. Professional rivalry could not be mentioned in the 1960s (between Cleveland General Hospital and the small clinic owned by the Sheppard family). This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed every year. I wonder if that ethnic neighborhood was chosen for some significance? The parade in the street reminded me of the scene in Blow Out or The Net. The film does not tell of Dr. Kimbles future. Will Dr. Kimble face the same problems that Dr. Sheppard faced after his acquittal? We hope not. It will take another court case to reverse the first verdict.

The real story of Dr. Sam Sheppard is better than any movie or novel. F. Lee Bailey said anyone who is a suspect should immediately get the best defense lawyer around. Would a pharmaceutical company take such desperate action to hide the bad effects of its proprietary medicine? It would be liable for millions for producing a harmful medication. All medicines have side effects, that is why they are controlled substances. Is there any independent testing of a new medication? What is the FDAs policy. After this watch Wrongfully Accused, a parody of this story.",1473724800,,2584,4.647702407002188

Harrison Ford is spot-on perfect as the falsely accused doctor, grieving, fearful, desperate, determined.

The cinematography, some of it in the North Carolina mountains, is gorgeous, and shows up beautifully on the Blu-ray. Excellent supporting cast. Even though you know where the story is headed, you don't know how it's going to get there, and there are some nice twists along the way.

This movie loses absolutely nothing in watching it now as opposed to 20 years ago. The action is great. Harrison Ford is outstanding. You will be pulling for Dr. Kimble to find his wife's killer from the second he runs away from that train. Tommy Lee Jones is also excellent. I can't think of many better action/thrillers over the last 30 years.",1464566400,5,462,4.566265060240964
116411,5,079072961X,"This movie is one of my favorite thrillers to watch. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are just perfect in this movie, and the story is really captivating. You can feel the intensity of the chase and experience the anxiety of Dr. Richard Kimble in his efforts to find the murderer of his wife before the police catches him. But since the story is well-known, I want to focus my review more on the blu-ray edition than on the movie itself.

In his review, Steve Douglas did a great job listing all the new features added to the blu-ray transfer from the DVD. While I was watching the movie, I enjoyed the clarity of the image and the new sound. I have a pretty good sound system, and I could feel the ground vibrating during some sections such as the train chase. Also, this new edition includes new features such as the pilot episode from the TV Series The Fugitive, and a new documentary entitled ""The Fugitive: Thrill of the Chase"". It also includes all the previous features that were already on the DVD edition.

The price is so low that you might just want to buy this blu-ray right now without asking any questions, especially if you are a first-time viewer. You will not regret it!",1464220800,2,1188,4.470046082949309

Tommy Lee Jones plays the U.S. Marshall charged with capturing him who doesn't care whether he is innocent.  They truly dominate every scene they are in and the movie is worth watching for their performances alone.
  Having said this, the movie is not very believable and--for me the only major problem--I don't like the ending.  The movie should have ended ten minutes earlier.  If it had I would have given it 5 stars.  I know some like this style of ending, but I feel it was very contrived and repetitive, obnoxious even.",1451520000,,684,4.737288135593221

Now my kids (teens) are old enough to watch it with me and they still found it very enthralling. The movie is so well done, that it is one of few that I would say is nearly perfect. Everyone loves Harrison Ford, and this is one of his best movies, ever.

116574,5,079072961X,"It's hard to find a film about a man being pursued by the law that comes anywhere close to The Fugitive.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones turn in outstanding performances here.  Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble who is wrongly accused of killing his wife while Jones plays U.S. Marshall Sam Girard who is in pursuit of him once the prison bus is derailed and Kimble escapes.

Kimble prove his intelligence by evading the law again and again although just barely on most occasions while Girard displays grit and determination in continuing the pursuit.  This film also provides beautiful shot of Chicago, including the green river for St. Patrick's Day.  There's some excellent supporting cast as well with Sela Ward(Gone Girl), Julianne Moore(Hannibal), Joe Pantoliano(The Sopranos) and Nick Searcy(Justified).",1448668800,,808,5.232558139534884

Judging from the reviews, the picture quality is as perfect as it can be as I have verified myself, however the Blu-ray itself is very poorly presented.  First of all lets talk about the cover art, whilst the main graphic remains of Harrison Ford running, they have changed the font to a futuristic style and it just looks awful!  Secondly, when I inserted the disc in my player I was disheartened to see a flat 2d image with what look like buttons just found on stock images in Google or something!  Blu-ray isn't just about cleaning up the picture, it's about presentation and delivering the full package, in a world where piracy is increasing we need a better treatment of Blu-rays in general.  The menu buttons are terrible and look like they have been taken off Google or a box standard picture library, it's shameful to say the least that this is what we pay money for.",1444262400,,997,4.610169491525424

It is a movie with a beginning, middle and end as a great wrong must be put right again.

116675,5,079072961X,"This is the one we've been waiting for! I wasted no time grabbing this, after the terrible disappointment that was the original Blu-ray release. The Fugitive is arguably one of the greatest murder thrillers of all time, right up there with Hitchcock's best, and it was deplorable to see it released in a sloppy MPEG-2 encode and with Dolby sound, pretty much indistinguishable from a mediocre DVD. Color was weak and uneven, picture was flat looking, and  there were even some color registration problems in the print. And the lifeless sound. This movie deserved the best treatment, and it finally has it with a vibrant AVC encode and DTS-HD MA audio that pops right out at you.

The Fugitive is NOT a crystal-clear shot-in-the-studio film, like Hitch's pictures mostly were. Most of the film was shot on location, so it's not the crisp spectacular detail you use to show off your HDTV with. It's soft looking, with narrow depth of focus, lots of indirect and natural lighting. But the Blu-ray transfer is great: fine detail is there when it should be, the color depth is spectacular, good flesh tones, deep blacks, deep blues, deep reds and greens, and the narrow focus gives it an immediate, 3D sort of feel.

I'm very happy that I plumped down a few bucks for this re-release. I'm sure to watch this great film 100 times more, now that it looks and sounds as good as it should.",1438041600,,1380,4.670781893004115

116791,5,079072961X,"It seems I spend a lot of time walking down memory lane these days. This review describes yet another movie I used to have in my collection before I made the final jump from laserdisc to dvd and yet another movie that hasn't been part of my collection for more than decade - until now. Maybe thats because I find it increasingly difficult finding great new titles to ad to my collection. Tim Robbins - some time back, in an interview - commented on what he called the homogenization of Hollywood. Robbins thought Hollywood was basically making the same 4 or 5 movies over and over again. Personally I think that's a bit overstated, but there is - none the less - some thruth to his comment. If you look at networks like HBO, they very often use the same basic frame to create their succes-shows. And in tinseltown it self a lot of movies are remakes of old classics and this one is no different: The Fugitive.

Based on the Emmy-winning and highly succesfull TV-show (1963-67) starring David Janssen, this revival stars Harrison Ford as doctor Richard Kimble and Tommy Lee Jones as U.S.Marshal Sam Gerard. Kimble is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife and is sent to State prison, only the prisoner transport suffers an accident and Kimble is able to escape. The guy tasked with recovering Kimble: Sam Gerard, a relentless and accomplished U.S.Marshall. Kimble however isn't just escaping to avoid prison. He is on a manhunt himself, looking for the  one-armed man, who actually did murder Kimbles beloved wife. Ever so slowly the pieces starts to fit and Kimble has to realize that not everyone he considered a friend actually is one. At the same time Gerard is closing in and he is only looking for Kimble. But he too can't ignore the discrepancies in Kimble's case and by the time he finally catches Kimbles, he too knows the true story behind the Kimble-killing.

This movie is classified as an action-movie, but that doesn't do it justice. It is also a characterdriven drama featuring two of Hollywood's greatest actors in a riveting and engaging story of loss, retribution and tenacity. And it is one of the few examples of remakes actually bettering the original, which in this case will have taken some doing.",1429488000,,2233,4.73521850899743

116793,5,079072961X,"I have never seen an episode of either TV version of The Fugitive.  I wasn't born when the 60s version was airing, and I never got around to watching the 2000 version.  But Ive seen the 1993 movie take on the story several times and enjoyed it each time.

The story follows Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who comes home from a late night emergency surgery one night to find his wife (Sela Ward) dying on the floor, obviously murdered.  And the killer is still in the house.  However, by the time the police show up, the killer has fled, and the police can find no evidence anyone else was there.

So despite talking about a one armed man, Dr. Kimble finds himself arrested and convicted of his wifes murder.  While being transferred after his sentence, the bus hes on is in an accident, and he finds himself freed but hunted by Special Agent Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).  Can he stay one step ahead of Gerard long enough to prove his innocence?

Being a mystery buff, I must say from this stand point, the movie is very well done.  I buy the evidence used to convict Kimble, even though we see from the start that he is innocent.  The plot unfolds nicely with clues leading us and Kimble to the ultimate solution.

What sets it apart from the mysteries I normally tend to read is Tommy Lee Jones Agent Gerard.  The man is relentless and smart, and he seems to always be one step behind Kimble.  While he starts out with one mission, as Kimble begins to feed him evidence, you can tell Gerard is intrigued.  He is still focused on bringing Kimble in, but he thinks that Kimble might really be innocent.  That makes him a very likable antagonist.

While a mystery movie, there is an action element to it as well.  The accident that really starts the story is still intense.  Thats the biggest action scene, but there are several others including some good cat and mouse scenes.  Yes, some are unrealistic, but this is an action film.

Between the mystery and the action, the intensity never really lets up.  If you haven't seen it before, youll be captivated.  And if you have, youll still get caught up in things all over again.

The acting helps.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are clearly the stars, but the rest of the cast does a great job of filling their roles as well.  Personally, I get a kick out of seeing Andreas Katsulas, who I best know as alien GKar on Babylon 5, out of his makeup.

So whether youve seen it before or never watched it, give The Fugitive a look.  Youll find a movie that is still fun 20 years after it was released.",1429228800,,2557,4.405982905982906

116853,5,079072961X,"I recently asked my 18 yr old daughter to watch this with me and of course was met with, awwww not that old movie. She had never seen it but if it's not made within the last 2 years you have a hard time getting her to watch. I promised her before we started it that she should leave her phone in another room because if she looks away even for a second she'll miss some excitement that is essential to the movie. She absolutely loved it and couldn't believe that a movie this old (her words)  was that good. Geez, what is it with teens these days? Anyway to anyone who has never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and grab a very large bowl of popcorn and get ready to be on the edge of your seat for an hour or so. Very fast paced, great actors and just an all around gripping story. I've watched it many many times and never get bored with it.

116894,5,079072961X,"This film finally got the respect it deserves...it looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray, such a HUGE improvement over the garbage BR that Warner put out previously!  I found a few scenes (in particular the courtroom scene and a night scene here and there) to appear a tad soft, but the rest of it looks very film-like with a some nice grain that was retained and not scrubbed away during the remastering process.  The scenes in the daylight look gorgeous given the age of the film.

On the audio side, despite a TON of previous viewings, I have never heard Tommy Lee Jones drop the ""F-bomb"" after his line about the ""Peter Pan"" dive at the dam which is a testament to how clear the audio is this time around.  The train/bus wreck scene was absolutely SICK and totally made my palms sweaty!  In addition, the raid on the upstairs apartment where they actually arrest the European guy was crazy...it sounded like there were 6 people running around in the living room above my basement!  I'm legitimately hearing things I'm certain I have never heard before in this film.",1418688000,,1069,4.62962962962963

117012,5,079072961X,"A great minalimist introduction to The Fugitive.  Richard Kimball is 6-months out as a fugitive just trying to survive.  He hits Tuscon and hes a nighttime bartender.  This should be some decent cover, it isnt, however.  The bar pianist, played by the lovely and excellent Vera Miles, is the estranged wife of a Phoenix high-roller.  The high-roller, played by Brian Keith, won't let go even as she had fled to a a scrapy existence as a jazz bar pianist.  Keith haunts her nightly.  The stakes get higher as Keith employs his power and has Kimball picked up by the local PD.

In one episode we get the gist of what The Fugitive is all about. A serendipitous escape as per a train derailment on course to death row.  A innocent fugitive running, crossing paths with certain individuals that put him in peril of exposure.  Kimball, seeking to take the high road while he seeks out, his wifes killler cant turn away from others in equally dark situations.  He tries valiantly, to find his own innocence while helping others. Its a dire situation.  Mr. Wells, Kieths character, is a metaphor for societys justice.  Misguided as Its Kimballs constant conundrum.  Kimba;;is now guilty until proven innocent.

The death sentence looms over Kimball.  He is a marked man.  He might well be innocent, but that really doesnt matter until he can find and deliver the one armaed man who was the real murderer of his wife.  Vera Miles character sees the truth behind her savior.  Again, this doesnt matter, its all in the details and thiose hinge on Kimballs search for the real killer.  Its all here, right in this initial episode.  Lt. Phillip Gerrard who will not rest until he has Kimball back in incarceration.  This is The Fugitive.

It all comes to a head at the bus station.  Kimball puts Miles, and her son on a bus to a new life in San Diego.  He stays behind and has a confrontation with the Mr. Wells charter.  It ends in Wells being shot by security at the bus station.  Kimball retreats to his dark corner, but Lt. Gerrard finds Mrs. Well, the Miles character, in San Diego.  Miles doesnt know what has become of Kimball and she professes his innocence.  Gerrard, of course, doesnt care as all he desire is Kimball, but Kimball is is not to be foundyet, anyway.  This is The Fugitive and its an excellent introduction.  So starts one of TVs absolute best series ever.",1400976000,,2367,4.617788461538462

117017,5,079072961X,"Rarely does a TV series adapted to film create the same nuances and personal details that a long running series on TV accomplishes. But, there is always the exception and The Fugitive is just that. Harrison and Jones make an unexpected A team. Their acting styles and deliveries are polar opposites, and yet they create something deeply moving and real in the narrative of this film. It never fails to hold my attention, not just from a visual perspective, but in the telling of a really good story rooted in human frailties and the misgivings we have about others. As a 20-plus year old film, it continues to hold up and contend with anything in the same genre being made today. I also believe that Fugitive and the 1985 film, Witness, have established Ford as an actor of great range in his craft.",1398816000,2,799,4.594405594405594

Not so much the problems themselves, but in a broader sense.  To summarize Tommy Lee Jones's quote...it's a monster.

The health care industry is just that an industry.  It's not there to make people healthy.  It's there to make money.
You would think that in order to rein in the health care problems, they would have made them get back to what they were.  Nope, let's keep making people feed this monster.

So, if you're looking for great acting, particularly by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, an engaging plot, some great chase scenes, and everything else necessary to make a great movie about the pursuit of a fugitive by a cop obsessed with his capture, then watch this movie. It will keep you glued to your seats. It never drags. And it's believable.

117066,5,079072961X,"An excellently told story that will keep your mind engaged from start to finish. Not only so, but there is plenty of classic Hollywood ""action"" that keeps you on the edge of your seat. And not the ""new"" style of outlandish CGI action that is so prevalent and over the top in much of the movie fare of today.
The Fugitive features a much more raw and genuine type of action - a style that is iconic from several 80's and 90's films.

5 stars!

This is a classic and I have enjoyed watching it several times.

NOTE: Some might find this film intense in some scenes. For a more detailed description of the film you should check it out on IMDB

117070,3,079072961X,"I love this movie and I like the idea of owning it on Blu-ray, but I might as well have saved my money for a special edition or similar release that actually takes advantage of the upgraded format. This release does not.",1380153600,,220,4.261904761904762
117071,5,079072961X,"While I have the Standard Definition DVD, I avoided the previous release of this film on blu ray due to its lousy video transfer and lossy audio.  Since most everyone includes summaries and acting opinions I will focus, as I always due, solely upon the quality of this new release.

VIDEO...
  The video transfer is fantastic and has clearly been remastered for this release.  There is no appreciable grain or disturbing artifacts anywhere.  Color grading appears to have been redone as well as all colors have a very natural and real life appearance.  In one early scene, a blue door appears to pop with color but not in an unreal 'Transformers' way.  Details, large and small, are easily perceived and even hair on heads are not mushed blobs but each individual strand can be seen.  This is the video transfer that all have been waiting for and they did not get back doored. The transfer to Blu Ray makes it appear as if the film was made last week on the latest and highest resolution camera equipment.  There is no letter boxing of the film as it fills your entire screen.  The video transfer is a 5 star transfer in all ways.

AUDIO...
  We finally have The Fugitive coming with a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio which provides perfectly transparent dialogue and excellent audio balancing of the excellent background score with both dialogue and the many foley effects.  Panning across the front stage as well as the front to rear and rear to front audio stages are frequent and realistic especially so during helicopter scenes.  Subtle foley effects are perfectly leveled in the surrounds with discreet directionality for many of them.  Once set, you will not need to go back and forth with your remote's volume control.  The audio transfer also rates 5 stars.

EXTRAS...
  Several new and interesting extras including current interviews with both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as well as the director and producers and other cast members.  One extra that was on the Standard Definition DVD focuses upon the making of the train wreck.  Not sure why they kept this extra in its original 4x3 aspect ratio but they did.

The Fugitive retains its filmic legs both in acting and storylines.

All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer and I hope this helps you in deciding your purchase.

117079,5,079072961X,It doesn't take much guesswork to determine my favorite part of this great film...the speech made by Tommy Lee Jones's Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard to start up the manhunt for Harrison Ford's Dr. Richard Kimble.  And that is only the start of what there is to like about this film.  It's not hard to root for both main characters and being left to wonder how they might both come out on top in the end is certainly worth those two hours of watching.  These brillant men are surrounded by excellent supporting characters and face off against brillant villains whose identities are perfectly obscured until just the right time...and even then the ending is still uncertain.,1377993600,,676,4.810344827586207
117080,5,079072961X,"Warner Brother is a Studio I hold in high regards.
They usually do offer real value in their BD releases
However .I do feel more comfortable reading the reviews first.
And a 4k scanning is not always necessary.
I saw screenshots and read the review.
And from what I saw and read.
I thought this new BD special edition is a worthy upgrade.
And any softness is not the fault of the BD transfer /but the fault of how the film was shot.!
And as far as pixilation goes.
As far as I am concerned it looked like natural film grain to me.
I guess some videophiles have a hard time telling the difference.
By the
way  same goes for Taxi Driver.
I happen to think the 4k release of Taxi Driver is ridiculous.
Because I have the original Taxi driver BD release.
And I think Sony pictures did a excellent job the first time around.
Why would anyone want to throw out all those great special features just to get a picture that is only marginally better.?Why.?
And besides that Blu-Ray is only 1080p. So you're not getting true 4k any way.
4k is a joke.!

The 25th anniversary BD release of the Fugitive

It  scored a solid rating of 4.on both picture and sound.
I also compared the screen shots from the two releases of this film.
And found this new special edition to be a vast improvement over the old BD release.
This new release also ads more special features.
If you don't believe me.
You can go to blu-ray.com.
Typ in the Fugitive. And see for yourself.
I'm also skeptical about RE-releases too/but sometimes it is worth it. And Warner is a Studio that cares.
I just want to add.
I just watched the 25th Anniversary edition of this film on BD.
And as I suspected the A/V presentation is much improved over the first BD release.
Better contrast and color.
Even though this is not a 4k release. It's still well worth the upgrade.
Also the audio is DTS master audio instead of the old standard DD audio",1377993600,8,1893,4.354107648725212
117081,4,079072961X,"I'd imagine that most people have seen ""The Fugitive"" (1993) by now.  If not, you're missing out on one of the best thrillers of the 1990s, featuring great performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, lots of terrific chase scenes, an interesting plot, memorable music by James Newton Howard and much more.  The film has held up nicely since 1993: it's still capable of entertaining modern audiences who have seen all the films that ""The Fugitive"" has influenced.

The first Blu-ray release (with the black cover) was pretty lackluster, featuring a relatively weak A/V presentation (including lossy Dolby Digital audio) and a few recycled bonus features from the old DVD special edition.  This new 20th Anniversary Edition (white cover) has a great new transfer, a new lossless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track and two new bonus features: a retrospective featurette with Ford, Jones, director Andrew Davis, actors Joe Pantoliano and Jane Lynch; as well as the 2000 TV pilot of ""The Fugitive""'s  revival series, which was cancelled after 22 episodes back in 2001.  This second series has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray thus far, so it's nice to have a taste of it here.  Also, the older DVD bonus features are here as well, including a few vintage featurettes and more.

Overall, not quite a fully-loaded edition but definitely a big improvement over the first Blu-ray release.  Whether you bought that, held off or have never seen ""The Fugitive"", this 20th Anniversary release is worth picking up.",1377993600,86,1505,4.988

117096,5,079072961X,"One of those above average thrillers that caught on with audiences and critics and reached astounding peaks for a film in this genre, `The Fugitive' is one of those widely known and generally liked films that doesn't hold up to the reputation that comes from an Oscar winning film and yet never really disappoints.  It's an exciting film that delivers the goods, and while I don't understand how this made the shortlist for categories like Best Picture and Supporting Actor (first off, Tommy Lee Jones is a Lead here, and second he does nothing in the movie), I can't help but kind of love this movie.

Expertly crafted, `The Fugitive' tells the story of Richard Kimble, a doctor whose life is flipped upside down when his wife is murdered and he winds up being charged with her murder.  Claiming that a one armed man did it, he's basically laughed out of court and into handcuffs, but a botched breakout leaves him a free man (sort of) and so he sets off to clear his name and find his wife's killer.  The whole time he has Samuel Gerard on his tale, hunting him down like a dog.  A couple close calls later, Kimble is able to uncover the real reason his wife was murdered, exposing his true friends and his real enemies.

Ford is very impressive here.  He carries this film on his shoulders and manages to shed his stern facial features long enough to actually emote serious pain and suffering.  You can feel him in every scene.  The rest of the cast pales in comparison.  Tommy Lee Jones has presence, but he's just there and doesn't really stand out with Ford dominating the film.  The supporting players like Joe Pantoliano, Jeroen Krabbe and Julianne Moore are effective if a tad forgettable.  The real star of the show is Andrew Davis. He builds such palpable tension in every frame and creates a film that flows from scene to scene and keeps the audience engaged.  It's sad that his film was honored with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and yet he was snubbed in favor of Jim Sheridan.

It stands the test of time and remains and exhilarating film.  It's one of those films that is very easy to watch time and time again, thanks to the swift pacing and attention to detail.",1371686400,2,2186,4.540816326530612
117097,5,079072961X,"This review is regarding the 20th Anniversary Edition of ""The Fugitive"".  I have been wondering if Warner Bros. forgot about ""The Fugitive"" and how amazing it is.  I can finally look forward to a REAL High Definition Blu Ray of this movie!  This release, as I have seen on blu-ray dot com, has a DTS-HD 5.1 sound mix AND it is REMASTERED in 1080p!  The other thing I am stoked about is that it will be in the ORIGINAL ASPECT  RATIO that it was filmed in at 1.85:1.  The previous blu ray release was a JOKE.  It was Dolby Digital, Aspect Ratio was 1.77:1, and it was NOT remastered into High Definition.  blu-ray dot com states ""I haven't seen a Blu-ray transfer this bad since Young Guns. Even my non-techie wife noticed this one was subpar. The quality definitely picks up a bit as the movie wears on, but it's still rather dull and flat, and detail is moderate at best. There is a definite lack of definition and attention to fine detail evident throughout. Kimble's hair, especially after the train wreck, often looks like a glob of color rather than fine, individual strands of hair. Black levels are moderately good at best, and dark scenes are plagued by extreme amounts of grain. Some bad compression is present throughout, noted primarily on straight, shiny objects (especially on chrome-colored lines on cars), looking blocky and chunky rather than straight and natural. Granted, director Andrew Davis, director of Under Siege, has employed a similar style in both that film and this one, a bleak, muted, and ""grainy"" look, a look that definitely doesn't lend itself very well to a ""pretty picture."" Still, there's nothing to be excited about with this transfer. The experience is best described as resulting in a downer, saddened that such a wonderful movie appears as such a poor looking transfer on Blu-ray, no matter how much of it is intentional on the part of director Andrew Davis and how much is the result of a bad disc (and I believe the latter to be the main culprit).""

I am VERY excited that Warner Bros. finally decided to give ""The Fugitive"" the treatment it deserves.  I will own this one when it comes out.",1371427200,5,2132,4.661333333333333

Ford jumped into an already established role (Dr. Richard Kimble) which is something new he brings to his roles. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones stole the movie (and an Oscar) as Marshall Samuel Samuel Gerard.

It makes no difference if you are familiar with the history of the Fugitive, the one-armed man or the classic TV show. This movie is updated so seamlessly that it makes no difference that there was a TV show that aired thirty years earlier for four years.

117125,5,079072961X,"I remember seeing this movie when it was first released in theatres and I can tell you I was spellbound from beginning to end. The tenacity of Richard Kimball was phenomenal. How he perservered to bring the true killer to justice put me in awe.

I won't go into too much detail concerning the plot. Others have done that here. What I will do is discuss some of the contrivances and please feel free to comment on this if you will. First of all, during the fight with the one armed man there would have been DNA and fibres from the man's clothes left on the stairwell. This would have allowed for some reasonable doubt if he had been charged. I did like the attention to detail concerning Katsulas and his gloves This would have prevented his fingerprints from being left at the scene of the crime. But we must remember that he fired the gun that killed Richard Kimball's wife. Thus Kimball's hands would not have had gunpowder residue. That point would have been brought up at trial and would have created reasonable doubt. Too, would not someone have seen a short, one-armed man running away from the scene of the crime? These matters would have been brought up by Kimball's defense attorney at the trial. One more thing: Tommy Lee Jones asked and got a warrant for tapping Kimball's lawyer. That is never granted unless it is a terrorism investigation. That alone would have gotten the US Marshall in hot water to say nothing of firing a gun at a suspect at point blank range, resulting in his fellow agent's hearing being lost in the right ear, not to mention putting the man's life in danger. I once knew a US Marshall, and I can tell you that he would have called Jone's character an apocrophyl representation of a US Marshall.

Despite the flaws, this movie is Five Stars. One of the best in its genre I have ever seen. Buy the dVD and you won't be disappointed. This is the 205th Five Star review and the 282nd overall rating.

117148,5,079072961X,"This is a riproaring suspense film that is brilliantly cast, and has a cat-and-mouse plot that thankfully doesn't rely on the old shoot-em-out action sequences.  Tommy Lee Jones is pitch perfect as a relentless lawman who loves the chase, and has no mercy for his quarry, but gradually comes to sympathize with Harrison Ford's character, Dr. Richard Kimball, who is innocent and looking for the elusive one-armed man who killed his wife and got him sent to prison for life for murder.  Sympathising doesn't make him soft though, he's still going to get his man.

The thing I love most about this movie is the small scenes, the throwaway lines, especially by Tommy Lee Jones.  Such as when one of his people says ""It's hinky"" and he gets annoyed.  ""What does hinky mean?""  The guy explains.  He says ""well then say that.""  Then he waits a beat and spits out, irritated, ""I don't want any of you all saying hinky anymore.""

I mean, there's absolutely no need for that sequence, it doesn't advance the plot, and yet it helps us understand who this man is.

117154,5,079072961X,"""The Fugitive"" (1993) works because both the man chased and the man doing the chasing are likable.

Harrison Ford plays a wrongly accused of murder physician escaping from captivity, trying to prove his innocence by locating the actual criminal who did what Ford is accused of doing (murder).

It'a a similar, though less leisurely, role to that played by Ford in ""Witness"" (1985) in which Ford plays a Philadelphia police detective wrongly accused of crime and hunted by other Philly cops (who are actually guilty of the crime).

The entire movie moves, and pulls the audience in because both the protagonist and his pursuer are likable characters.

The policeman doing the chasing is portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, who got a Best Actor Academy Award for ""The Fugitive"" (1993) and deserved it.

The audience roots for both the man chased and also the man doing the chasing.

It is important for audiences to like characters they are presented with in dramatic movies. The more humanity, character depth, and intelligence a character shows through his dialog and actions, the better the movie, and this applies to all characters in the story, certainly all the main ones.

Harrison Ford faces two opponents during the movie....Tommy Lee Jones (the major opponent on the screen most of the time), and a minor villain (also likeable in his portrayal) who does not survive to the end of the movie.

All characters in well written screenplays should be likeable, human, and multi-dimentional, not characatures, and certainly not villains who are characatures.

""The Fugitive"" (1993) does this very well, better than any other famous action movie I ever saw.

""Casablanca"" (1943) starring Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains comes close, and has a similar structure with two main opponents who end up friends at the end (Bogart and Rains) and a villain who is dispatched at the end and not really centerstage most of the time (""Major Strasse"" played by Conrad Veidt).

Another thing which makes ""The Fugitive"" (1993) a superior movie is the complete absence of four letter word expletives commonly heard in most other ""action movies"" (espcially Bruce Willis movies). Good action movies are possible and better without the expletives. But in today's world (2012), it is unusual to see and hear a movie without them, sadly.

He escapes from the authorities and instead of fleeing and hiding he sets out to prove his innocence and find the people responsible for his wife's death. He knows that a one armed man was involved and killed his wife; the only problem is how to find him.

Everyone thinks Kimble is guilty and all the evidence points to him trying to collect on insurance money. He escapes when other prisoners try to escape. He has no choice as he is convicted to death row. Something is strange about Kimble as when he is escaping he saves the life of one of the guards of the prison bus. True criminals don't behave that way.

US Marshalls are called in to capture the escaped prisoners and Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is the head man in the effort to find Kimble....

117161,5,079072961X,"Based on the classic TV series starring David Janssen, The Fugitive (1993) is one of those films that if you see it on cable, you are drawn to watch it, regardless of how many times you may have seen it before.  It's hard to say exactly why this may happen, but it is a film with some spectacular action scenes, which moves at a frenetic pace, where something is always happening.  The performances of superstars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, are other reasons, as is a story that somehow holds together remarkably well.  The screenplay incorporates a few key elements from the TV series, but widens the focus from just being about fugitive Richard Kimble (Ford), to also follow the activities of Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard (Jones), the man leading the team tracking Kimble.  Rather than just running away and hiding, Kimble is on a mission to discover the truth.  In total, it all makes for an extremely entertaining watch.

Well versed in action films, The Fugitive is probably the high point of director Andrew Davis' career.  Prior to this, his most significant projects might have been the Chuck Norris film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Code-of-Silence/dp/B00004Y87N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Code of Silence</a>&nbsp;(1985), and Steven Seagal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/6304779089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>&nbsp;(1988), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>&nbsp;(1992).  The Fugitive is action packed, though without a lot of shootouts, fights, or car chases involving Kimble, who uses intelligence and some luck, to keep just ahead of the law.  Harrison Ford is perfect for this version of Richard Kimble, a man who is desperate and vulnerable, but also tough and extremely resourceful.  He gets a little help, but is mostly on his own, tracking down the one armed man, and eventually the person responsible for the death of his wife (Sela Ward).

The leader of the investigative team, is a role commonly found in action films, but as Sam Gerard, Tommy Lee Jones has the persona and charisma to actually play a hardass supercop, without coming off as a completely pretentious and puffed up jerk.  Gerard operates at the front line with his team.  His first meeting with Kimble in a drainage pipe, is brief but memorable.  When Kimble says, ""I didn't kill my wife"", a cynical Gerard, focused only on the task at hand, replies ""I don't care"".  Gerard was apparently so popular, that the character returned, along with some of his staff, in the feature film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Marshals/dp/B001AS43VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Marshals</a>&nbsp;(1998), pursuing yet another fugitive.

No matter how many times you have seen it, The Fugitive still has great entertainment value.  The story could have shown more about Kimble's relationship with his wife and friends, as well as his trial, but in keeping things lean, we get to the chase that much sooner.  The ending is overdramatic and cartoonish, but after the long buildup, Kimble and Gerard's second meeting just had to be special.",1335657600,2,3302,5.901260504201681

117165,5,079072961X,"UPDATED: Now that the 20th Anniversary Blu-ray is available, I can finally give this 5 stars.

Unfortunately Amazon lumps reviews for all editions together. Don't buy the old black-cover Blu-ray, the transfer on that disc was shameful. The 20th Anniversary white-cover version has a gorgeous new transfer of this classic film in true 1080p, with crisp DTS-HD Master Audio. It looks like it's had some image stabilization applied to compensate for gate weave in the film, and it's had a little bit of grain reduction applied, but both effects are tastefully done and not over-the-top. The disc also comes with a nice assortment of special features, and the typical price here on Amazon is a steal for a great film well-presented. I recommend it unreservedly.

The review for the original, inferior disc is preserved below for contrast & historical accuracy.

=========================================

The two stars are for the Blu-ray, not the film itself, which I love and would happily give 5 stars.

Other Blu-ray reviewers have referred to a ""soft"" picture. Actually it is literally *pixelated*.

If you take a close look at high-contrast edges, like the names of the actors during the opening title sequence, you can plainly see big blocky pixels that are far too large for 1080p. Based on that, and some occasional frame-blending artifacts, it is clear that the source transfer for this disc was a standard-def telecine (60i) like what would be broadcast on cable networks. The authors of this disc took that old SD master and did an inverse telecine pass to remove the pulldown/interlacing and get a 24p SD master. (Unfortunately there were a few errors at edit points, causing the aforementioned frame-blending.)  Then it was upscaled to 1080p, but they didn't even do an interpolation algorithm, it's just nearest-neighbor pixel doubling. Yuck!

I will give it an extra star because (1) it's usually very cheap and (2) it's way better than the DVD. There are none of the old compression artifacts or edge enhancement here. But for a Blu-ray, it's very disappointing. It's barely worth the 8 bucks I spent on it.

Also I have to disagree with those who complained about the black levels. The contrast is fine, it's just that the film itself seems to have been shot in a run-and-gun medium-budget style that did not emphasize rich cinematography. There might be a little bit more range to eke out color-wise from the original film negative, if WB will ever break out the wallet and pay for a new transfer, but I'm betting there isn't much more depth to be had.",1332374400,12,2567,4.9511627906976745
117166,4,079072961X,"I remember when this film came out and was wondering how it would compare to the TV series of the Sixties.

Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimball who has been tried and convicted for killing his wife.  But he didn't do it!  Through an accident, he escapes and Federal marshal Girard goes after him, played seriously by Tommy Lee Jones.

TV versus Movie!

On TV it was a continuing series with Kimball disguising himself and avoiding Girard, going through various areas where he would use his medical knowledge to help others and became a master of disguise while he was at it.  Girard was obsessed when others gave up.

The film has some of these elements, but seems more concerned with medical malpractice and how some doctors can go crooked.  This was the good part.  And Tommy Lee, though plays it in a wisecracking way, plays a pretty good cop.

There were some pretty farfetched scenes:  Jumping off a waterfall would kill a normal man but not Richard Kimball!

Bottom Line:  Action and adventure, though Girard is not as obsessive as the TV series, the crooked medical men hiding behind their reputations is intense.

I know, I can afford the regular price but when I can pick up ""The Fugitive"" DVD for under four bills, it just makes the viewing all that more pleasurable. OK. I'm a bit eccentric, but one has to have some method of choosing movies to watch late at night.

""The Fugitive"" stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in an action-packed chase movie. It begins with Ford (playing a prominent surgeon) having his beautiful and loving wife murdered and with him getting the blame, found guilty and imprisoned. Then, while he's getting transported from one site to another, he's inadvertently involved in a train wreck and freed. Enter Jones, a super-cop from the U.S. Marshall's office, and the  chase is on. Will Ford, the chasee, escape and be able to simultaneously solve the mystery of his wife's death and invalidate his prison sentence? Or will Jones. the chaser, and his super-efficient team catch the fugitive? Well, the chaser is amazingly close to the chasee throughout the remaining 3/4 of the movie until all is finally resolved at the end. It's a fun movie to watch. Lot's of spectacular action. Good visuals and interesting characters.

The cops (ie., federal marshals) are just incredibly efficient, so efficient that it defies credibility. Well, it's just a movie, but if cops were this good almost all of us would be in jail. I know, I know, I can suspend belief in some movies but I had trouble with the federal police in this case. Funny, sometimes things will win me over and I won't even notice the discrepancies. In this film, I noticed and it distracted from the story. In any case, the film was a good value and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the future.

It looks as good today as when it was first to be seen, as a first run movie, on television, and, then, on disc. The chase for an innocent man, seeking only to prove his innocence, is right up there with the best, although not the best among them. Ford is perfectly cast as the hero without ""side"", without the arrogance of a man of achievement, without the loss of humanity, to which nature predisposes any person in his situation. Repetition has taken some of the luster off the Award winning Tommy Lee Jones performance; he still fits the bill, pretty well, in the role of man-hunter. There is enough action to keep up the pace and more than adequate acting skill, by the supporting cast ably to reinforce the stars performance.

I Don't Yet Have The Sufficient Blu-Ray Viewing Experience Or Knowledge,That Previous Reviewers Of THIS Particular Blu-Ray Obviously Have.

But As HARD As I Tried, I Simply Couldn't See ANY Difference In This Blu-Ray Transfer Of A TRULY Great (& Smart!!), Suspense Movie.

Seeing Scratches Right At The Very Beginning With The Warners Logo, Certainly Didn't Help. And The Less Said About The VERY Ridiculous ""Phone Call"" Featurette Between Director Davis & Tommy Lee Jones (Interspersed With A Clip Of A Grouchy-Acting Harrison Ford), The Better!!

I Can See Why, This Blu-Ray Has Been Marked Down;But Won't Go Too Far In My Critique Here, Considering It Is A SURE Bet That Warners Is Probably Prepping A 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray With ALL The Trimmings, For 2013!!

117176,5,079072961X,"I've not looked at the special features yet but didn't appreciate the bit of silliness inserted at the very beginning of the main feature. As for the film itself, it's the best realistic, edge-of-your-seat action drama I've ever seen.
Yes, surviving the dive into the dam's spillway is a bit of a stretch, but I suppose it's possible. As rough as that concrete looked a few frames later, don't surfaces that constantly get washed by water usually develop a slick coating?
Comparing this to the latest Batman film leaves Batman wanting, in my opinion. In fact, even without the comparison, Batman seemed overly long as I was watching it.
Addendum: I've just watched it again and cannot say enough good about it. Instead of the silliness often seen today where twenty and thirty-somethings are all running about stiff-armed with automatic pistols pointed at everyone's head and they're all kung fu experts, you have a brilliant heart surgeon who's systematically solving his own misjudged case. The dive into the dam's spillway is a bit of a stretch but possible, and considering his options, amounted to the only way of proving his innocence -- the alternative was death by injection.
Also, when you watch the special features, you learn that the original script included features that would have made the story less credible.

I caught this little jewel on the tube recently and quickly was reminded how I sat mesmerized in the theatre back in the early Nineties during THE FUGITIVE's initial release.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are grand fun to watch as a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife (the sensationally gorgeous Sela Ward) flees from the law (while simultaneously identifying the real murderer, don't ya know) and is relentlessly pursued by a pit bull of a U.S. Marshal.  My goodness, we have train wrecks, jumping off of hydro dams, falling through skylights, and much more carnage requiring titanic suspension of disbelief, but come on, Ford plays a doctor who always manages to stitch himself up.

The supporting cast is equally fun, led by Joe Pantoliano (one of my fave character actors), Jeroen Krabbe, and Jane Lynch in a very brief role (long, long before 'Glee' fame).  A young and sizzling Julianne Moore also appears as an overwhelmed ER doc.  Sure, the action comes in metric truckloads, but the suspense, plot, and pacing are finely tuned, and Ford and Jones play well off one another.  THE FUGITIVE is one fun rollercoaster; sit on your sofa and hang on.

I watched this movie several times, Jones does give a good performance but I bet no one expected him to win the Oscar. Jones gives a performance that is so low-key that a moment or two gave a great impression to the Academy.

My wife surprised me with a Blu Ray player for father's day and I've purchased 13 Blu Rays and this movie as BY FAR been the most dissapointing. I have proably watched this flick 50 times. I know the dialogue almost word for word and know how scenes will finish before they complete so I was shocked at the added dialogue and longer scenes that accompied this version. Perhaps this is a special addition, although it's not labeled that way anywhere on the packaging. Also the (so called) video upgrade is nearly nonexsistant. Of the 13 movies I now own this is the worse (barely above DVD quality) of the lot.

The film requires not only a complete suspension of disbelief but a suspension of intelligence also (like most Sylvester and Arnold movies...). That HF survives the jump from the top of the dam without a scratch is totally unbelievable, but apparently the writers needed this kind of nonsense to sell the script.

I bought the film because I'm a fan of Tommy Lee, who always imbues a part with intelligence and warmth. Compare his performance with Ford's usual wooden acting (with a lisp no less...).

To watch HF escape from one impossible situation after another, is boring, and ultimately actually funny. Dig the scene where he is walking down a dark road, and a pretty woman stops her car and asks ""Do you need a ride"". Now that's real believable, eh?

In the light of all that follows, you wonder why HF couldn't subdue the ONE ARMED MAN who killed his wife. Oh right, SuperFord SHOULD have been able to do it, but there would have been no movie (and I, for one, would be grateful!!!!). And he must have had an inexperienced Legal Aid attorney, who couldn't establish reasonable doubt, to have been convicted in the first place. Beautiful, wealthy Sela Ward? So much in love? He was rich, but she was richer...not exactly a believable motive.

After he sneaks into a hospital to search out the truth (posing as a janitor), he is asked by a female doctor to wheel a black boy who is having trouble breathing to an operating room (bet than happens a lot). Then he looks at the boy's x-ray for a few seconds, decides he has been misdiagnosed, and changes the boy's chart for a change of treatment. Of course, he saves the boy's life. All in a day's work for SuperFord. Man I wish he was available to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf!!!! This guy makes Welby, Kildare, Casey, and Jonas Salk look like first year interns!!.

Then, of course, the topper. He exposes his fellow worker who falsified documents and switched tissue samples just so his new drug could be approved by the FDA (""No side effects"". Oh come on. Even I don't believe that...) and he could make millions of dollars. A straw man, the surest indicator of cheap, amateurish writing.

As I said this is only for diehard Ford fans who have to own EVERY movie he made. I'm a big fan of Tommy Lee, but the film is so stupid, I have a hard time sitting through it....",1276732800,4,2398,4.513824884792626

I love this flick, and think both the script and Ford do justice to the original, justifiably beloved tv series. I don't think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print, though; while it's a good, crisp picture, it's not much of an improvement over my dvd.

The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent updating that works well. There's thrills aplenty, with minimal violence, which I appreciate more every year as idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-planned plots. There's more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes it all mesh tightly and suspensefully. The ending is a bit weak: I don't buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the degree it must, and that's good enough.

Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever one needs to be reminded what a truly fine thriller can be.

Too bad they didn't polish it up enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high-def.",1263859200,3,1114,4.582914572864322

A Chicago doctor, Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), is wrongly accused of murdering his wife. He is relentlessly pursued by Deputy Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Doing what he does best, Ford delivers another solid performance.

By the way, part of this movie was filmed in North Carolina. Near the 30 minute mark look for a road sign pointing to Murphy, North Carolina.

Warner Brothers has done an outstanding job restoring and enhancing ""The Fugitive"" for its 20th Anniversary. This Blu-Ray is very highly recommended for your home video collection.

Until Amazon comes up with a different rating system that allows us to grade the technical quality of the product (transfer etc) and the product itself (the movie) I have to give it a lower score than the movie deserves.
The movie features Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man falsely accused of the murder of his wife. Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones). The ensuing action details Kimble's attempts to clear his name, all the while trying to evade his pursuers. Director Andrew Davis crafts a taught and exciting movie and delivers what is one of the best movies of the 1990s. But for all the movie does right Warner have seen fit to deliver it to Blu-ray in a transfer that is at times painful to watch with a soft and undefined image that contains large amounts of grain and is overall dull with a lack of detail. The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses. There os also a smattering of featurettes.

It was 1 cent used on Amazon and that made me so happy.  You can go through a million movies and TV shows in which someone false gets accused of a crime, but what you'll ultimately think of as your barometer for that sort of thing is The Fugitive.  It remains so exciting, tense, such a hair's breath away from total discovery.  It gets you so extraordinarily invested in the justice-demands-it plot of Harrison Ford's wrongly accused Dr. Kimball as it does Tommy Lee Jones's Agent Gerard.  I've liked a lot of strange foreign, indie, ""old"" movies over the years, but if I had a couple hours to spend on a cold day, I'd probably spend them with The Fugitive, caring about everyone, being pushed along bold storytelling momentum, stuck desperately wishing for justice and luck to work out just a minute longer for Sam Kimball - at least I'd know I'd be in good company.",1250035200,3,1023,4.386243386243386

Once in a lifetime, when I was a kid of 10 years, I would find a program on TV that the whole family - 3 generations - could enjoy.  Well, Amazon has brought back the joy of reliving the past with The Fugitive (the original with David Janssen).  I invited my 90-year-old mom to my room to view it with me.  There was Richard Kimball in all his hyper-vigilant glory, ducking into alleys and hiding out in bus terminals, constantly running from ""the law,"" police detective Gerard.  I'm told the series is based on the great French nover, Le Miserables, by Victor Hugo. I read it and sure enough, The Fugitive brings out the essence of predator vs prey.

We understand the reasoning behind their actions, ""good"" or ""bad"". If that were not the case (as in the sequel, ""U.S. Marshals"") we couldn't care what happened.

Ford is perfect. He is appropriately intense and sympathetic.
Jones is excellent. Appropriately acerbic, sarcastic and caring.
Jones' team of marshals is perfect. The characters are distinct and fleshed out. No unnecessary redundancies in characterization.

One satisfying twist on the ""chase movie"" cliche is that the antagonist, Gerard, is not actually the bad guy. He's after an escaped convict, but he's not the one who murdered Kimball's wife or framed him for the murder. More than anything, he wants justice.

The Fugitive is overrated, but it's still a great movie with great moments: like, any time Tommy Lee Jones is on screen. Ford and Jones are both super, and luckily the film concentrates on their relationship. But the plot? Hm, a one-armed man did it, and there's one one-armed man in the film. Huh. Pity the one-armed man isn't the greatest actor out there, either, but at least they don't give him too many lines. Jeroen Crabbe doesn't add anything interesting to his thinly written role. On the plus side, Joe Pantoliano is great, I love the train wreck, the narrow escape from the downtown detention center and the ensuing coverage of the St. Patrick's day parade.

117204,5,079072961X,"I watched this for the umpteenth time while exercising. Let me tell you, it was effective. Between taking my mind off what I was doing, and raising my adrenaline levels, it made for some intense workouts.

It was based on the TV series, which I never saw, so I don't have a basis for comparison.

The plot is fairly simple. Vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) returns home and finds his wife murdered. He's arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime, but ends up escaping when a prison transport bus crashes. U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is in charge of the task force hunting for him. Dr. Kimball realizes that the only way to help himself is to discover who really killed his wife--the one-armed man--and who's behind it.

There's a perfect balance here between chase scenes, suspense, and unraveling clues. The chase scenes and the more static suspense scenes didn't drag on until (as happens far too frequently) I got fatigued, and the detective work by both sides wasn't a series of boring sitting-and-thinking scenes, either.

Aside: note to filmmakers: regardless of the type of scene, if it goes on too long, it gets boring (yes, including sex scenes--I've watched enough boring porn movies to know).

It doesn't hurt that the movie stars Tommy Lee Jones, either. Or that he fit the role perfectly. As did Harrison Ford. Though Dr. Kimball was a less exciting character, it made sense that he'd behave the way Ford portrayed him--bewildered, angry, completely out of his depth, but smart and determined. So much so that for a space of time I could believe it wasn't a movie at all.

This was the first Blu-ray I purchased and frankly I was disappointed with the video quality. I realize the film is never going to look as sparkling and clean as more recent films, but the image quality seemed lacking.

It has a soft, washed out 'milky' look and the detail is off and on. Sometimes the close-ups on faces are impressive, but then it will cut to a city shot at night and I really noticed the lack of definition.

Of course much of this flatness comes from the fact that the photography was fairly dull in the first place (the whole film has a 'grey' look), but I still expected something more impressive on the Blu-ray format.

Also the sound is not HD or PCM. It comes with the same audio as the previous DVD.

117209,4,079072961X,"The Fugitive is a great thriller of a movie, but holds a special place with me.  Part of this film was shot in my hometown of Sylva, NC plus many of the other surrounding areas.  This is a small town not many have heard of, small enough to be used in this film as a small town somewhere in backwoods Illinois.  I didn't know there were mountains in Illinois anyways?  The train wreck scene, which is one of the most spectacular action sequences of the film, I have had the enjoyment of seeing the preserved wreckage in person on a train ride that you can take in the area.  The scene where Harrison Ford jumps from the dam is actually Fontana Dam, located about 45 minutes west of Sylva.  Anyways, enough of the details about those scenes, but in case you were wondering, thats where they were shot.

As a whole this movie is extremely well crafted.  You've basically got an edge of your seat thriller, updated from the 1960's tv series.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both deliever first rate performances and have great chemistry, something that keeps this movie strong till the very end.  The story is well written and executed, and is complex enough to keep you thinking on your toes, but not too complex to ever feel left out.  The action scenes are wonderfully shot, and the chases and elements of suspense are tight.

There's little more to say about this film, it is very good in all areas.  It doesn't contain the best story written, the best cast of characters, or the greatest action scenes of all time.  But it does have a dose of all of that, and with a very solid feel in the end.

As most here already know the story, I'll just discuss the Blu-ray disc.  The film came out in theaters in 1993, and the Blu-ray transfer is a good transfer considering the film's production period.  The transfer is mpeg-2, which is kind of surprising, but like I said, the movie is quite a few years old.  Regardless, it is obviously a nice step up from the standard definition as outlines and details are sharper and clearer.  There's a small percentage of grain seen throughout the movie, but it's tolerable (unlike 300).  Brights are never blown out of proportion, but at times I felt as if they were ignored in this release.  Colors tend to blend more so than newer releases, but this almost gives the film a more natural look, and for many this would be considered a good thing.

The sound of the film is a step up from the standard definition, but it's nothing too special.  Special features are the same as the earlier standard releases, so there's nothing new to look forward to here.

117214,4,079072961X,"1993's ""The Fugitive"" stars Harrison Ford as the title character in a very worthwhile movie remake of the 1960's television series that starred David Janssen.

As in the TV series, Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is falsely convicted of having murdered his wife but escapes from custody during a spectacular train wreck.  Kimble returns to Chicago to seek the one-armed man who really killed his wife, while trying to stay one step ahead of his relentless pursuer.  Tommy Lee Jones reprises the role of Gerrard, the obsessed detective of the TV series.  Kimble's search for the real killer will end in a dead heat with Gerrard's pursuit of the runaway doctor inside a Chicago hotel.

Although obviously lacking the extended suspense of the four-year TV series, the movie captures the essential elements of its predecessor.  The Fugitive tracks the real killer through a thin string of clues. At the same time, he must stay on the move and off the grid to avoid his relentless police pursuer.  Along the way, his random acts of kindness for total strangers convince the viewer of his real innocence.

Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the doctor on the run, in a more emotional portrayal than the stoic David Janssen.  Tommy Lee Jones as the pursuing U.S. Marshal is a more complete and sympathetic character than Barry Morse's grim, humorless rendition in the original series, enough so to rate a OSCAR and his own sequel (U.S. Marshals).

The availability of modern special effects and the need to pack the story into a feature length movie makes for breathless pacing, as the Fugitive makes a series of spectacular escapes from the law, beginning with the train wreck that saves him from the death house.  Of necessity, Kimble's trail of clues is fairly intact and leads him fairly quickly to the one-armed man, and to an unsuspected and deadly conspiracy.

Fans of the 1960's TV program will enjoy this well-done movie if they can handle the time compression; viewers arriving fresh to the story will find this a breathless and thrilling chase with a surprising ending.",1189555200,,2070,4.899713467048711

PLOT SYNOPSIS

Dr. Kimble (Harrison Ford) arrived home one night to find his wife Helen on the verge of death after being brutally attacked by a one armed maniac.  Before she died, she was able to make a desperate call to 9-11, so the police arrive shortly after the incident, just in time to find Helen dead.  The police notice that Kimble is all scratched up, as though he had just been in a fight or had just murdered his wife himself.  Despite Kimble's description of the true culprit, the police arrest him and charge him of his wife's murder.  The trial goes badly and Kimble is sentenced to death by execution.

On a prison bus, on his way to the facility that housed the chamber that would eventually kill him, some other convicts attempt to pull off an escape.  There is a violent uprising inside of the bus and the lumbering vehicle tumbles down a hill and stops on a railroad track.  The oncoming train collides with the bus and creates one of the most spectacular train wreck scenes to ever appear on film.  By chance, Kimble, and another convict, make it out of the crash alive and set out on foot to escape the law enforcement personnel who are sure to appear once they learn about the disaster.

Unfortunately for Kimble, the federal marshal who is put in charge of the operation is none other than Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), who is completely determined, quick-thinking, and efficient.  He is unbendingly bound to his duty and will stop at nothing to catch his man.  This is revealed in the famous tunnel scene, when Kimble points a gun at him and says ""I did not kill my wife,"" Gerard retort is the cold ""I don't care.""

Since Kimble has already been convicted and sentenced to death, his chances of resurrecting any kind of life are exceedingly grim.  He can either hide out for the rest of his life, or try to lead law enforcement to the real culprit.  In order to accomplish the second option, Kimble would have to investigate himself, and somehow, based on the scant evidence at his disposal, somehow find the criminal.  But can he do it before the brilliant Gerard closes in on him?

ACTING

Tommy Lee Jones' performance is one of those performances that won, and actually did deserve to win the Oscar.  Every second of Jones' performance is absolutely convincing.  It is rare that an individual's character can be developed so fully in a two hour film.  He is more than the stereotypical, ""success at all costs"" law enforcement office.  From his persuasive scowls when he hears of Kimble's successes, to the tone of his voice when he barks orders and makes observations, his performance alone is enough to watch this movie several times.

Harrison Ford logs in another solid performance.  Over the course of the last 30 years, Ford has been one of the most consistent actors of all time.  The Fugitive is actually one of his better roles.  He plays the part of Richard Kimble to near perfection.

It is not uncommon to see two huge stars on one film at the same time, but it is uncommon that they perfectly fit the characters that they are asked to portray, and it is nothing short of a rarity that they interact in such a memorable fashion as they did in the fugitive.

The more minor actors are nothing special, but they are not bad either.  Jerome Krabbe played a respectable Dr. Charles Nichols,, with his hair parted neatly to the side and his somewhat nerdy smile, he represented what most Americans picture when they imagine a highly educated doctor.  Joe Pantoliano played Cosmo, Gerard's assistant.  We get a lot of sarcasm in a high pitched voice, and that is what Pantoliano is known for.  It added some extra entertainment and made the mechanical law enforcement machine slightly more human-like.

SO DOES IT THRILL?

How does the fugitive stack up against other thrillers?  Most thrillers, even some successful ones, have a small amount of tension causing elements.  The movie-makers work with a somewhat limited script, and get as much thrill as they can on two or three suspense-provoking fundamentals.  Sometimes these movies do an excellent job at thrilling us, and leave us satisfied.  The producers, directors, and actors of the fugitive did not need to stretch out every possible element for cheap thrills, the script, which took years and million dollars in development, thrills the audience on multiple levels.  Even mediocre actors would have turned this script into a nail-biting experience, the super performances by Jones and Ford only make it even better.

This one is definitely a classic in its genre.  If you still haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out.",1182124800,,4717,4.723378212974296

117221,5,079072961X,"Movies based on television shows are frustrating for the creative team behind the adaptation and often prove to be somewhat hit and miss.  The reason is because in a TV show the writer/director gets to spread his/her story over the course of multiple episodes or even an entire season.  In a movie you only get an average of 2 hours to get your story out, which can cause problems when adapting a television series, whether it be a long-running or short lived show, for theaters because you just don't have the luxury of time.  There have been some successful adaptations, ""Starsky & Hutch"", `Star Trek', `Mission: Impossible', and even `Charlie's Angels' (though I didn't care for either incarnation of the franchise), along with the success there have been those that failed ""The Avengers"" was lackluster, and ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" was the most recent, and possibly the worst adaptation I have seen in a long while.  In 1993, Warner Brothers felt the calling to try their collective hand at an adaptation, and their choice was the hit TV series ""The Fugitive"".  To assist in the success of their endeavor the WB enlisted top-notch, veteran acting talents Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and hired director Andrew Davis hot off his highly successful submarine action film, ""Under Siege"".

""The Fugitive"" tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who after a charity event arrives home to find an intruder in his house and his wife murdered.  After fighting off the intruder, Kimble alerts the police, and upon their arrival Kimble is surprised by the fact that he is arrested for the murder of his own wife.  After being found guilty at his trial and sentenced to prison, the prison bus Kimble is being transported by crashes in front of an oncoming train.  After being freed by a correctional officer to assist with the other prisoners, Dr. Kimble flees in hopes of tracking down the one-armed murderer and proving his innocence.  However, hot on Richard's trail is a relentless U.S. Marshal, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), and his team of deputies, who will stop at nothing until their man is caught.  Let the chase begin!

Clearly the executives at Warner Brothers made an excellent decision to make this adaptation, and managed to find the perfect cast, writer, and director to pull it off.  The cast, led by Harrison Ford (an actor that delivers a terrific performance every time) and Tommy Lee Jones (who was great in this role and was rewarded with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), all give excellent performances, fleshing out each individual character and making the movie believable and real to the audience.  The story by David Twohy (""Pitch Black"" and ""The Chronicles of Riddick"") is full of twists and turns, with riveting drama and action along with bits of comedy sprinkled about to lighten things up just a bit.  The direction of Andrew Davis, though not flashy by any means, delivers a very tight, well-paced manhunt movie that keeps the audience fully engrossed from start to finish, even though they already have a pretty good guess what the outcome will be, based on the source material.

As I stated earlier some adaptations of TV shows to movies work out well and some don't, and the reasons generally stem from what I pointed out in the beginning of this review, but sometimes the results may vary depending on how committed to the project the cast/crew and the studio are.  It's nice to see that for ""The Fugitive"" all parties involved in the making of this picture gave their best, and the fruits of the labor paid off big time, making this movie one of the best TV series adaptations to ever be made.

""The Fugitive"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1178064000,,3706,4.809448818897637
117222,4,079072961X,"Hollywood has welcomed several great crime drama films over the years,and one of those films happens to be,by far,""The Fugitive"". An interesting and entertaining adaptation of one America's most successful televsion shows,it is always great to see good television shows being adopted into the films--something that this film proves quite well.

Based off a 1960's television series,this film is based in Chicago. Here,Harrison Ford plays Richard Kimble,a man who happens to be very fortunate:he is a successful and respected surgeon,with a large amount of money,good friends,and a beautiful wife whom he has a wonderful marriage with,Helen(Sela Ward). For Richard Kimble,things could not be any better,and Kimble himself is happy with the way that life is working out for him.

But,one night,things change for Richard Kimble and his life--in a negative way. After Richard Kimble comes home one night,he discovers that his wife is being murdered by a one-armed man. And,despite the fact that Richard Kimble is able to put up a good battle against this one-armed man,he is not able to win. Bad turns to worse when ""certain evidence"" falsely shows that Richard Kimble is responsible for the murder of his wife,and leads to Kimble facing execution on death row.

However,all of a sudden,things change. Once the bus that is carrying Richard Kimble and his former prisoners to the Death Row that they are going to be executed at crashes and ends up on a train track,Richard Kimble is able to escape. Fortunately enough for Kimble,he is able to return to Chicago. From here,Richard Kimble takes advantage of the opportunities that he has to find the evidence that he needs in order to learn more detail about his wife's murder,and to prove his innocence to the United States Marshals and the Chicago Police. But,will Richard Kimble be able to succeed in this,especially with the tight watch that the Chicago Police and the United States Marshals have over Kimble,and an intelligent and obcessed U.S. Marshal named Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones)leading the investigation to find Kimble?? Only time will tell!!!!

While ""The Fugitive"" may be very hard to follow and requires close attention to be paid to it,it is still a really good film. The script for this film is as suspenseful as it is entertaining,and makes you wonder what will happen next,with good surprises coming along the way. This film also has a lot of creativity in it,and despite the fact that it is based off of a television show,does a good job at not recycling the show that it is based off of (it is worth noting that a large portion of the events in this film are different from the events that occured in the telvision show)and being original--but at the same,not too original.  Also,let me add that Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do a perfect job at taking on the action in this film,in a manner that makes it entertaining and suitable,without pushing it a mile to being an action film. There is a lot of strong acting to be found here,as well. In Harrison Ford's performance of Richard Kimble,Ford portrays Kimble as a laid-back and intelligent man. He allows this film to have an appropriate amount of drama,balanced out by showing who Richard Kimble is as a person and Kimble's determination to prove his innoncence,while at the same time,bringing who needs to be brought to justice for his wife's murder. As for Tommy Lee Jones's performance of Samuel Gerard,Jones is brilliant in his performance. In his performance,Tommy Lee Jones provides the no-nonsence personality that he brought to the characters that he has portrayed in other films (the role of Agent K in the ""Men in Black"" films,the role of Travis Lehman in ""Double Jeopardy"",etc.),and allows this film to have suspense. At the same time,he allows this film's viewers to understand the current status of the both sides of the story that are depicted in this film. Those sides are the side of Richard Kimble,and the side of Samuel Gerard and the men who are assisting Gerard in the search for Kimble. Also,while you will not see Sela Ward throughout most of this film,Ward turns in a strong performance of Helen Kimble. In her scenes with Harrison Ford,Sela Ward provides a lot of compassion and chemistry. This is a contribution to this film being as good and interesting as it turned out to be. At the same time,it helps this film's viewers to take a walk in the mind of Richard Kimble,and know how Kimble feels as they watch Kimble solve the wife of his murder. All of this allows ""The Fugitive"" to fully come together as the good film that it is,and are good examples of why the film turned out to be as successful as it was.

The DVD for this film has a lot of good bonus features on it,as well. Here,you get a commentary that was conducted with Tommy Lee Jones and this film's director (Andew Davis),profiles of the lead actors in this film (Harrison Ford,Sela Ward,Tommy Lee Jones,Joe Pantoliano,Andreas Katsulas,and Jeroen Krabbe,as well as a profile of Andrew Davis),the list of the awards that found Tommy Lee Jones winning best supporting actor for his performance as Samuel Gerard in this film,as well as this film's theatrical trailer. These are all strong and worthwile bonus feautures. But,what really does justice for the bonus feautures here are these:""Introduction"" (this finds Harrison Ford,Tommy Lee Jones,and Andrew Davis discussing the good memories that they have of making this film),""Derailed:Anatomy of a Train Wreck"" (this discusses the scene in this film that feautures this film's famous train wreck scene,and how it was put together),and ""On The Run With The Fugitive"" (this discusses the making of this film,and provides a thorough behind-the-scenes look into the making of it). These are all excellent bonus feautures for any film that is represented on DVD,and give this film the recognition and respect that it deserves.

117227,3,079072961X,"...that is the message from this rather illogical but fast-moving film. Poor old (wrongly convicted) Dr. Richard Kimble escapes from State Prison, and through some inexplicable legal quirk, the Federal Government takes jurisdiction for capturing him. Good thing too, since (according to this film) all state cops and other State and Local authorities are venal idiots, and the Feds, by contrast, are hyper-competent and masterful Law Enforcement Professionals (capital letters). I love the scene where Tommy Lee Jones (a Federal Marshal, no less) almost captures Kimble (Harrison Ford)... Get Down On Your Knees Richard, if you don't want to get shot!... (you can almost hear him think: ""this is the proper position for ANYONE when in the presence of the all-mighty Federal Government..."" By the way, fugitive Richard Kimble has not committed the ultimate crime of criticizing an incumbent politician within 30 days of an election in violation of McCain-Feingold. No, he is (wrongly) convicted of murdering his wife.

When referring to a large drug company, Tommy Lee Jones (embodying the Federal Government) remarks ""that company does nine billion dollars in sales a year... it is a monster"" ... you can almost hear him say ""...the kind of monster that Bill and Hillary have been fighting all their lives.""

Despite the heavy-handed portrayal as the Federal Government as the rightful Master of Us All, this is a fast-paced action film that holds the viewer's interest. Harrison Ford is as appealing as always, and Tommy Lee Jones shows us that we don't really need laws or judges to restrain the Federal Government, because it has contempt for these things anyway. After all, as Jones points out, he wants wiretaps on everyone, including Kimball's lawyer, and he will justify this later, ""if I'm in a good mood."" Hey, who needs the Constitution?

I watched a few fantastic looking Blu-Ray movies: Fifth Element, Last Samurai, and Enemy of the State. But when I finally put Fugitive in, I was blown away. I can't believe how this older film scanned to HD so well! It was like watching it for the first time. My whole family stopped what they were doing and sat down and watched this movie.

117233,5,079072961X,"'THE FUGITIVE' REMINDS ME OF 'NORTH BY NORTHWEST' - THE 'WRONG MAN' THEME GREATLY ACCELERATED

'North by Northwest' featured Cary Grant who had been a huge star, especially at the box-office, a lot like Harrison Ford, the star of ""The Fugitive."" Instead of the bi-plane that flies into and causes the gas tanker to explode with Cary Grant racing from the scene, we've got the mother of all train wrecks which Harrison Ford literally leaps from a nanosecond prior to impact!

THERE IS A LOT MORE TO 'THE FUGITIVE' THAN JUST CHASE SCENES

Richard Kimble did not kill his wife. We knew that when we entered the theatre because we had all heard of the TV series by that name and some of us even saw the hourly mystery program when it ran in the 1960s. We knew about the one-armed man, the conviction of Dr. Kimble, and his quest to prove that a one-armed man had committed the horrific deed.

'THE FUGITIVE' DELIVERS SURPRISES + SUSPENSE & RESOLUTION TOO

Somehow this seemingly very tired theme came alive and grabbed my attention very early. Although I found the opening sequence a bit lurid and disturbing, it was captivating nevertheless. With an obvious sense of pacing, the trial of Dr. Richard Kimble was as rapid [on-screen] as a disclosure of the basic facts of Mrs. Kimble's murder allowed.

From Kimble's conviction, we are jettisoned to the biggest and most visceral TRAIN WRECK sequence I have ever seen on film. More importantly, it established sympathy for Kimble as he not only barely escaped death, but he saved one of the guards in the process. This incredible action sequence led directly to the introduction of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard and the unbelievable chase scenes that followed.

The action sequences and suspense are so genuine that even the mundane scenes, like when Kimble was going through the one-armed man's private papers, were intense. No matter how many times I watch this film, I am amazed by how enthralled I am with the action and characters, despite knowing the complete storyline. I dare say that even the Master of Suspense himself couldn't have done better!

117243,3,079072961X,"Anyone who truly enjoyed the TV series THE FUGITIVE, starring David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, as I did (I still think it was one of the best dramatic series - ever), will probably be disappointed in this movie remake starring Harrison Ford as the maligned doctor intent on finding his wife's real killer, as I was. Tommy Lee Jones plays Lt. Gerard, the police officer determined to bring Kimble back after he escapes from prison (on the TV show he escaped after the train he and Gerard were riding transporting Kimble to prison wrecked). Kimble saw a one-armed man running from his house the night his wife was murdered, and is convinced he's the killer.

The movie becomes nothing more than a thrill-packed chase flick (some might say that's enough). Jones's character is much more interesting than Ford's. Ford does some very improbable things, such as going back to the hospital while on the lam and going to the jail to talk to a suspect with one arm - things that would have been thought too crazy for the TV show audience (and rightly so). Janssen's portrayal of Kimble was superb: there was a constant nervousness about him, a relentless fear exuding from him as if expecting disaster around every corner, and a bone-weariness that captured Kimble and his dilemma perfectly. Ford displays none of those qualities, and comes across as a man who is out to prove his innocence, by golly, you wait and see -  despite the fact that it's almost a given from the start. And, of course, he does, and it's a dummy conclusion: it ends up he was the target of a drug scam by a big pharmaceutical company. What a drag. That never would have washed in the TV series.

I would recommend the TV series over this movie any day, but unfortunately the TV series isn't available on DVD. Why that is I don't know, but I hope it becomes available soon. Real soon.",1147219200,5,1854,4.578313253012048

Well, as good as the TV series was, this was far better. Two scenes alone: the train wreck and Harrison Ford taking a swan dive - were worth the price of the film. Great stuff.

The story has been discussed by many so let me just add how much I appreciate the sound in this movie. When this film first came out on VHS, I used the opening moments as a demo model for various surround systems. The DVD has enhanced that as well as the picture.

The film has just the right amount of action scenes, very interesting characters and a storyline complex enough to bring you back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate everyone's acting in this movie.

Cast:  Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, Sela Ward, Julianne Moore, Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Jeroen Krabbe, Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, Ron Dean.

Running Time:  130 minutes

Rated PG-13 for intense situations, some violence, and language.

Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by a fast talking agent (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious ""one-armed man.""

Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role, Ford's intent wasn't to play ""Indiana Jones"", but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon and his wife. Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting) and his search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool.  Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character.  Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark.  He creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent, as his only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.

Director Andrew Davis has not been known for exemplary work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked interest within the film industry.  With such films as ""Under Siege,"" ""Code of Silence,"" and ""Above the Law,"" he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris), while here he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot).  The film is brilliantly scripted by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, who manage to remain faithful to the plot of the original show, while updating it for contemporary audiences and condensing it into a two hour narrative. James Newton Howard also does a fabulous job with his score, which is emotional and exciting at all the right moments. The story is paced very thoughtfully, so that the characters are introduced and developed meaningfully, without tedium setting in while the viewers await the action. ""The Fugitive"" is a terrific film, totally absorbing and exciting from beginning to end, and easily one of the best action films of its year.",1135987200,,4365,4.921088435374149

117254,3,079072961X,Janssen was actually an actor of very limited acting ability. He was  also drunken and self-absorbed and this all got wrongly mistaken for a man deep in thought as he was on the run from the law (as Kimble was supposed to be). The Fugitive series could suffer violently in watching it rerun as Janssen's obviously highly limited acting talent makes all the eps seem way too much alike. Harrison Ford OTOH is an actor of far greater emotional range. He could have perfectly played Kimble on a weekly tv series and been 5 times more interesting than Janssen had ever been. Ford also has greater energy than Janssen ever did. This makes Ford a great screen presence.,1134172800,,663,4.61864406779661
117255,5,079072961X,"It has been said that frequently the reality overpasses the fiction. And this is precisely, the point of departure for this intriguing film, deeply enrooted in the Noir Film grounds. During his absence the wife of Dr. Kimble is being murdered, he arrives to crime scene and fights daringly with the one arm assassin but there is nothing to do. Desperately he makes all what you must not do, leaving his fingerprints around every corner of the room. The killer disappears and obviously he seems to be the main suspect.

The train accident is by far one of the most electrifying sequences in the cinema story, magnificently gotten by the Special Effects Team. This twist of fate allows him to escape to prove his innocence.  But the Lieutenant Gerard admirably played by Tommy Lee Jones (Best Supporting Actor) will not rest until he captures to Kimble no matter how.

The impressive human chase is only surpassed by Rambo 1, but the final result is major than the sum of its parts. Fabulous action sequences and to my mind the best performance of Harrison Ford in his career, to date.

Well deserved acknowledgement to Andrew Davis, a talented film maker, who by the way, is almost disappeared from the map.

This movie is full of both action and suspense. There are twists and turns throughout this movie that are unexpected, which makes it all the better. Take the one armed man, for example...(I'll say no more regarding that)

The character development and the portrayal of the characters in this movie also struck me as excellent.

The reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is that there wasn't anything special. The plot in this story is about as typical as it can get. Man is accused of murdering his wife, but he didn't. He's now a fugitive running from the law, set on getting revenge and proving himself innocent. Folks, it doesn't get any more bland than that.",1113696000,2,845,4.582781456953643

117264,5,079072961X,"When I was a kid I liked to watch ""The Fugitive"" episodes on TV.  It offered a unique scenario; an (innocent) escaped convict running from a persistent lawman goes from town to town meeting different people with different problems, challenges, asperations, etc.  By the time things are resolved in each episode, Inspector Girard is just close enough for Richard Kimble to flee to a new locale for a new episode.  The possibilities were endless because there were only two characters that were repeaters from one episode to the next.

In the movie, this aspect was lost but, in its' place, a more exciting set of circumstances were explored.  The TV version of Richard Kimble was always looking for ""the one-armed man"" (OK, I guess there were THREE characters that appeared in some or all of the episodes).  However, he never got close enough until the end.  In the movie version, Dr. Richard Kimble is a man possessed and the innocent bystanders were incidental to the pursuit of finding the real killer.  Jettison the human interest stories and focus on the chasee being the chaser and we've got a real action movie.

There is nary a dull moment throughout ""The Fugitive"" all of which is aided by a superb cast.  Tommy Lee Jones deservingly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the Marshall in pursuit.  Harrison Ford produces his customary above average performance and a number of other characters add a lot as well.  The aura of suspense coupled with the search to solve a mystery leads to a great climax.

This is one of those movies you stick with when channel surfing.  As good as the TV version was, I recall that I listened to a Twins game the night of the final episode.  Fortunately the scoreboard announced the outcome of the final episode (as well as the game) and the sportcasters relayed it to us listeners.  I think I would opt for the movie over the baseball game if the choice ever comes up.",1102896000,2,1927,4.640117994100295

117267,2,079072961X,"In `The Fugitive', Andrew Davis chose to adapt a television icon into a vehicle for its star, Harrison Ford. Unfortunately, at the same time, Davis managed to provide an icon for a trend that has been plaguing films since, presumably, moviemakers began to run out of viable plot lines: the Dumbing Down of the American Audience Movie. Although numerous examples could be offered from the film to demonstrate this unfortunate trend, the four most vital ones should suffice:

1) Ford, a successful and wealthy doctor, presented as being obviously close to his wife (or was her strewing of rose blossoms strictly for therapeutic effect?), is convicted of her killing with only weak and highly dubious evidence and motive which any decent attorney, let alone the battery of them he should have hired, would have shredded in no time.

 2) Since the crime was committed in Chicago, and Ford was remanded to the Illinois State prison for the carrying out of his sentence, a U.S. Marshal would not have had exclusive jurisdiction especially at the time the movie was made. Assuming Illinois was similar to most other states, their state police would have at least equal responsibility for escaped state felons, and even if help was given from the federal government it would have been on a collaborative basis. Both Tommy Lee Jones's right in asserting complete control of the case, and the arrogance in which he conducted himself throughout the movie, were ridiculous.

 3) The unjustly famous bus/train crash scene in fact, suffered from severe problems of continuity and logic. The bus clearly was not on any train tracks when it came to a rest; even if so given the nature of the terrain it rolled down it would have had to come to a rest along the tracks instead of across them; the entire scene shifted to an entirely different locale when the train did come along, including a large river below and beside the tracks; the second engine of the 2-engine train was obviously well beyond Ford instead of being behind him when it jumped the tracks; and in any event all he would have had to do was run a few yards at right angles to the engine's path instead of directly before it to escape it.

4) The one-armed man stated to Jones that he had been previously investigated by the police for the murder of Ford's wife. As a matter of course they would then have discovered that both his position in and the nature of the company he was working for should have been more than enough to arouse ample suspicion and lead them to the true guilty parties.

  Given these crucial shortcomings, along with the usual number of absurdities films of this type seem to indulge in (the Chicago police virtually en masse were portrayed as immoral and inept thugs), and the usual number of minor problems (Ford would have had to jump at least 30 feet out to hit the dam's converging water plumes and avoid the concrete wall, and from a standing position to boot!) and coincidences necessary to further the flow of the script (in the enormous Cook County Hospital complex Jones conveniently finds himself at a crucial time right outside the one department that gives him an insight into the crime), one wonders if most of the other reviews at this site were about the same movie, especially after its appearance on DVD allows for repeated viewings. The shame of it is that, given more care in directing and continuity, many of the above problems could have been eliminated and `The Fugitive' might well indeed have been an excellent movie.",1095465600,10,3517,4.743044189852701
117268,5,079072961X,"Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a wealthy Chicago surgeon wrongfully accused of murdering his wife (Sela Ward). In truth, a one-armed man killed his wife.

But as he begins to do a little investigating of his own, Kimble discovers that his wife's murder was not random, and that there may be other conspirators.

This is, without a doubt, one of the finest thriller/adventure films ever made. ""The Fugitive"" hits all the right notes. Ford's performance is particularly impressive; it's beyond me why he didn't get an Oscar nomination. Jones superbly matched him. Every actor did an excellent job, and direction by Andrew Davis (""Under Siege"") is great. A must-see for all movie lovers. But, who hasn't seen this movie?",1095292800,2,987,5.2075471698113205

Richard returns home from a fund-raiser to find that his wife has been brutally murdered, and a man is still in his house.  Richard, who soon discovers that the assailant has a mechanical arm, struggle, but the man escapes.  Meanwhile, as she lay dying, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) makes a 911 phone call that appears to implicate Richard.

Richard is tried and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection.  Richard is to be transferred to a maximum security prison along with three other inmates.  Once on the prison bus, one inmate fakes a seizure and stabs a security guard.  Another guard begins randomly firing a shotgun and hits the bus driver by mistake.  The bus careens off the road, falls down a hill, and comes to rest on a set of railroad tracks.  Battered and shaken, Richard tries to free the wounded guard, but an ominous noise makes him stop; a train is approaching!!

The next scenes are some of the best movie footage I've seen as Richard barely escapes before the train slams into the bus.  The engine comes uncoupled from the train and hurtles out of control, while Richard can barely move in his leg shakles.  He manages to get out of the way as the train flys past.

U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, played superbly by Tommy Lee Jones, soon has his men hunting for Richard. aided by his sidekick Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Sam is determined to find Richard and bring him to justice.

Richard eludes the Marshalls for the time being, but Sam soon catches up to him on a dam of all places.  Cornered, Richard does the only thing he can think of; he jumps.  Dumbfounded, Sam can only watch as Richard plummets over the side of the dam.  Sam doesn't believe that Richard died during the fall, so he sets out on his chase again.

This is one of the best action/thrillers that I've seen.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford give Oscar-caliber performances, and the supporting cast of Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, and Jereen Krabbe turn in fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the eye-popping train scene and Ford's plunge from the dam are excellent as well.

117270,5,079072961X,"The Fugitive is one of the best action/crime movies out there.  The story itself is gripping - a man wrongly accused, breaking loose and trying to prove his innocence while being doggedly pursued by ruthless law enforcement officers.  The movie doesn't waste a single moment; you're constantly propelled from one scene to the next, each scene linked tautly to the others, and you really feel that you're in the middle of the chase.  You become deeply involved in the fugitive's desperate actions.

He's Dr. Richard Kimble, a prominent doctor convicted of murdering his wife.  He is played by Harrison Ford in what is one of Ford's most memorable screen roles.  The performance is wonderfully understated, and that's why it's so powerful; we sense Kimble's quiet despair, quiet determination, his single-minded, all-consuming mission to clear his name and bring the real killers to light.  Tommy Lee Jones plays his pursuer, U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, and he is chilling - a cool, calculating, ruthless machine.  Even after it seems to dawn on him that Kimble is innocent, you're not sure what he'll do, or whether he'll refrain from shooting the fugitive doctor.  What's also so amazing about this film is how the relationship between Ford and Jones subtly changes over the course of the movie.  At first they're pure opponents, with no room for dialogue between them (""I don't care,"" Gerard says at one point, when Kimble protests his innocence).  Then, as Kimble starts leaving clues that point to the real murderers, the two are not merely opponents, but are also partners; Kimble must trust that Gerard's agile mind will pick up on the clues and form doubts about the doctor's guilt.  And at the end, Gerard reveals a new side of himself in one simple act of courtesy that moves you unexpectedly and makes you let out a sigh of relief.

The Fugitive is definitely worth owning.  It doesn't matter how many times you watch it - you will always be gripped, you will always be caught up regardless of whether you know what happens or not.",1091836800,3,2040,4.858381502890174
117271,5,079072961X,"What makes ""The Fugitive"" such a successful and superior film is that it knows what it is: an action/mystery film. It makes no attempt to make itself bigger or more intellectual than it is (as did the American version of ""The Vanishing""). Harrison Ford, surprisingly underplaying the role of Dr. Kimball--others might have overworked his grief and angst--turns in a brilliant performance. And the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones does an icy, sparkling job as Kimball's persuer, US Marshal Sam Gerard. So good a performance that he earned a well-deserved Oscar for it.
The other key to the movie's success is Andrew Davis' dazzling direction. He keeps the pace frenetic for a good deal of the film, and the pot is always kept boiling.

This is one of the most entertaining and engaging movies ever, far superior to a lot of movies playing these days.  For the few of you who don't know the plot, I'll run it past you without spoiling much...
The story revolves around a Chicago surgeon named Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) who is convicted of murdering his wife (Sela Ward).  He pleads innocent, claiming that a one-armed man committed the heinous crime (the opening sequence, showing the murder in flashback style, is chillingly realistic).  Well, no one believes the good doctor's alibi, and he is sentenced to death.  However, after his prison bus crashes into a train, he escapes back to Chicago to find the murderer, while keeping away from US Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team of deputies.
Having never seen the old TV series, this movie was nevertheless fantastic.  The thrills just keep coming, as well as the tongue-in-cheek humor, courtesy of Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pantoliano (as Cosmo, Sam's deputy), who really steal the show in a lot of scenes.  The screenplay is obviously very sharp.  The train-and-bus wreck will take your breath away, as will the waterfall sequence.  Aside from these action scenes, it's great that this movie is shot in Chicago, one of the greatest cities in North America.  Sorry, personal bias, I loved Chicago when I visited a couple years back.  The acting is very well done, and the characters are very three-dimensional.  Sometimes it feels like you're watching a modern ""Les Miserables"".  Nice transition from action thriller to action-mystery as the film enters its second half.  If you follow the plot, which is fairly easy to keep up with, the ending will shock you.  All in all, ""The Fugitive"" is definitely worth the bang for your hard-earned buck.  If you haven't seen this wonderful piece of movie-making, do so ASAP.
Quality-wise, the DVD is pretty good.  Director Andrew Davis does  a cool little documentary on how the train wreck was filmed.

117278,5,079072961X,"""The Fugitive"" to me is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside of either the ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" trilogies. This movie to me showcased how an actor who was known by two movie series could branch out into totally new territory and ""The Fugitive"" is the best example of this. This is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside the ID movies he starred in during the 1980s. I have never seen the original TV series so I'm not going to bother comparing that with the movie. Starring Harrison Ford as the surgeon Richard Kimble, and Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, these two actors were perfect for their roles as antagonistic good guys, both are on the side of good but are major rivals at heart, Kimble as a man on the run, and Gerard as the pursuer of him, unaware that the real killer of Kimble's wife is walking freely without trouble and actually has one arm (His other was presumably lost in an accident).
 It all begins at Chicago Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago where Richard Kimble is a highly respect, world renowned surgeon who is skilled surgically grafting new artificial limbs to amputees. His life however is wrecked one night when his wife Helen Kimble is murdered by an intruder and Richard Kimble is arrested and convicted of the murder of his wife when in fact, it wasn't him. After a catastrophic bus crash kills several of his cellmates, Kimble escapes and tries to get back home, determined to hunt down the one who is truly responsible for his wife's murder. Kimble is being chased down by numerous law enforcement agents who are also determined to catch him and have him put to death but Kimble tirelessly pursues the man who is really responsible for his wife's murder and the destruction of his reputation. His chief pursuer U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard however is tirelessly hot in his trail and Kimble is always on the move. A lot of really surprising answers will be discovered during Kimble's pursuit of his wife's real killer and a very shocking truth will come up about the motives behind the murder. Kimble is hell bent on proving his innocence.

 Almost everything that can be good about a movie especially a crime thriller comes together perfectly on ""The Fugitive"". The main characters Richard Kimble and Sam Gerard are absolutely incredible and show amazing depth and personality. One feels incredible sympathy for the falsely accused criminal Richard Kimble but also appalled at the Marshall's hell-bent pursuit of him when he's unaware or even cares of the target he's chasing isn't the one responsible. Chicago to me, was the perfect city for the movie to be filmed in, and the various places they go are sometimes out of the usual places and even go to places that most people don't ever see. I also love how both Kimble, and the U.S. Marshall officers figure out where Kimble really is and how Kimble himself outsmarts them every time. A lot of things really come to mind when seeing this film. When I first saw this a long time ago, it was a lot of fun with the non stop action but now I have come to realize that sometimes some of the most innocent people have been incarcerated for absolutely heinous crimes that were committed by others and even met their tragic end when the real criminals have gotten away with it even if the criminals do get apprehended in the end.
 Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are absolutely amazing in this movie and really brought their characters to life on here. Harrison Ford's role as Richard Kimble is absolutely powerful and moving and the numerous ways he gets places and defies his captors are just amazing, and even scary at times considering that serious real life criminals like drug dealers and serial killers and other felons use various means to defy the law. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones steals the stoplight....eh , I meant spotlight as the obsessive U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard as he is obsessively pursuing Kimble and bringing him in but also the two when speaking by phone are in fact helping to solve the real puzzle behind the crime that claimed Mrs. Kimble's life and pursue the real criminal whose behind it all. The other character worth mentioning is Dr. Nichols (The actor who plays him eludes me) as he brings some surprising answers especially towards the latter half of the movie. I also liked Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's sidekick Cosmo Renfro.
 You must get this movie. ""The Fugitive"" is one of the most gripping, edge of your seat, action crime thrillers that has come out in the last 25 years, if not the most gripping. ""Catch Me If You Can"" tries to imitate the whole cat and mouse pursuit styles of this movie but while good, CMIYC pales in comparison because ""The Fugitive"" has such powerful drama, something missing from CMIYC. Don't get me wrong, CMIYC is good in it's own way but pales in comparison. The extras in this ""Special Edition"" aren't really all that much to write home about and are rather unimpressive and hardly warrant this being called a ""Special Edition"" and the extra content adds little if anything to an already excellent movie. If you have the older DVD that was available before the special edition came out, you aren't missing out on anything on the newer edition. Despite the unremarkable extras on the ""Special Edition"" DVD, this movie is definitely one to own as it's one of the best movies that Harrison Ford has starred in outside of the ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" movies.

While Harrison Ford's persona has become a bit typecast in his recent movies, his take on Dr. Richard Kimble was spot on, channeling David Jansson's (sorry if that's spelled wrong) portrayal to the tee.  Ford took the original character, expanded his ""good guy"" elements and created a character as memorable as the original.
Jansson's Fugitive was a smart man and used his smarts week to week, to face each new crisis.  Ford does this well, stopping to diagnose a sick child and endangering his own freedom by saving a prison gaurd on the bus that was taking him toward his own execution.  At the same time, he maintained his hell-bent determination to prove his innocence.
Jansson did ""harried"" very well in the series and there's one scene in the movie where we see Ford at a distance, walking down a street. Because it's dark and he's a ways away, it almost looks as though Jansson had come back from the dead to do the scene, it's that convincing.
This movie has, and will stand up to the test of time because of it's study of character, be it Kimble, or Jones's Girard. A definite must-see.",1075852800,,1302,4.551282051282051

On his way to prison, Richard survives a spectacular bus-train collision which kills all of his fellow prisoners, and after escaping the crash, he is pursued by U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard(Tommy Lee Jones), who vows to hunt him down.  While Sam is on his tail, Richard tries to lead Sam and Sam's fellow detectives to Sykes(Andreas Katsulas), the one-armed security guard who actually committed the murder.  Soon after he escapes, Richard removes his facial hair and hijacks an ambulance in order to get as far away from Sam as possible.  Richard is momentarily cornered at a waterfall, but when he is confronted by Sam, he shouts ""I did not kill my wife!"" and then jumps into the river.  With everybody except for Sam thinking he might have drowned, Richard eludes his pursuers by hiding along the riverbank, going through small towns, and eventually making his way back to Chicago, where he practiced medicine.  Along the way he crashes a St. Patrick's Day parade and a banquet, saves a young accident victim's life, and all the time tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuers by finding evidence that exonerates him, first by breaking into Sykes' apartment and then visiting former colleagues.  At Sykes' apartment, Richard retrieves Sykes' artificial arm and some photos taken at a gathering attended by executives of the drug company Sykes works for.  Meanwhile, Sam interviews acquaintances and colleagues of Richard's, including, in addition to alleged hit man Sykes, Richard's medical colleague Chuck Nichols(Jeroen Krabbe).  To make a long story short, Sykes, the one-armed man, is apprehended, and when Sam makes the climactic confrontation with Richard on the rooftop, he reveals that Chuck had borrowed Richard's car the night Richard's wife died(this was hinted at in the opening scenes), that Chuck had let himself into Richard's home using one of Richard's keys, and that Sykes, the hit man, had been with Chuck when the latter went to Richard's home, even though Sykes denied knowing Richard when Sam interviewed him.  In short, Richard is innocent.  Watching the film, I got a sense of Richard's desperation as he flees his pursuers.  At the same time, he emerges as a heroic figure as he puts all the pieces of the puzzle together.  Harrison's portrayal of Richard is dramatic and believable.  Tommy Lee Jones, however, steals the show as Sam, the U.S. Marshal.  Initially a gruff cop who is convinced of his suspect's guilt, Sam eventually mellows as he reveals that the proof he has points to Richard's innocence.  The plot seemed a little disjointed at times--I couldn't figure out at first how Richard's clues(the switched drug samples, his colleagues' interviews) matched up with Sam's(Chuck's meeting with Sykes and the photos taken from Sykes' apartment, for instance).  It turns out--at least it's implied--that Richard's deceased wife might have been involved in one of the failed drug trials alluded to in the movie and that Chuck had arranged the murder to cover things up.  I can't figure out why that motive wasn't played up.  If the drug trials on Richard's wife went awry and Chuck wanted to hide that fact, I think that would be a reason for Chuck and Sykes to bump her off.  That wasn't established until almost the end of the film.  There's a lot of good action, however, and the cast is stellar.  I haven't seen a lot of movies starring either Harrison or Tommy Lee, but both their performances in The Fugitive are powerful.  Sela Ward(of TV's ""Sisters"") has an understated but important role as Richard's wife, Helen, and Joe Pantoliano, who plays Sam's key investigator, provides some humorous moments.  All in all, if you want action, suspense, and drama, The Fugitive has all of them.",1074816000,,4052,4.93952802359882

And off he goes, dodging the law (Jones) at every twist and turn, to find the real killer on his own.
Not only is it a great action thriller, however; it's also an intense and spellbinding character study, well-suited to the personalities of the two stars who play so well the roles of hunter and hunted. They come, of course, to have a mutual respect for each other.

This is also a Hollywood producer's orgasmic dream with a chase scene beginning in the first reel and lasting throughout.  It is based on the 60s TV show of the same name, but gets its premise from a true crime story, that of Ohioan Dr. Sam Shepherd who actually went to jail for murdering his wife in the 50s.  He too claimed to have fought off the real killer, but the forensic evidence and his personality were against him.  Here we have Harrison Ford as the good doctor, and it doesn't take a Hollywood genius to tell you that the most popular leading man of the late twentieth century ain't about to play the kind of guy who murders his loving wife.
Ford does a stand-up, competent job, saving lives and patting kids on the head as he plunges through sewers and off the top of a towering waterfall, steals an ambulance, survives a bullet wound and a bus wreck, etc.  His fans will be pleased, but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show (and got a Best Supporting Oscar for his trouble) as a clever, wise-cracking good ole boy who has a lot of fun leading the posse.  I wonder if he or director Andrew Davis invented the spin because without it, this wouldn't be half so good.
This is not to be confused with, nor is it a remake of The Fugitive from 1947 starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, a cinematic gem of an entirely different sort.

117285,5,079072961X,AWESOME MOVIE HARRISON FORD AT HIS BEST,1069545600,,39,4.714285714285714
117286,5,079072961X,"The Fugitive, director Andrew Davis' (Under Siege) feature film adaptation of the classic 1960s television series, was one of 1993's biggest hits, thanks to the talents of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, who earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard.
Ford plays Chicago surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (the late David Jansen's TV role), whose life is turned upside down when he is falsely accused of murdering his wife Helen (the luminous Sela Ward).  Taken to the Area Six police station, he undergoes the standard investigative process but can't convince the skeptical detectived that a one-armed intruder is the killer.  Arrrested, convicted and sentenced to death, Kimble is given a sudden and unexpected reprieve when a failed escape attempt causes the prison bus he's aboard to run off the road and land on a railroad track -- and in the path of an oncoming train.  Kimble escapes, but not before saving an injured corrections officer from certain death.
When Gerard and his team of deputies arrive at the crash scene, the other surviving corrections officer, in an attempt to cover up his incompetence and to take credit for saving his wounded colleague's life, at first claims all the passengers on board the bus were killed, but when sets of leg irons ""without legs in 'em"" are found, Gerard deduces that Kimble has survived and become a fugitive from the law.
The Fugitive compresses several seasons of Roy Huggins' suspense/morality play TV series, following Kimble's attempts to solve the mystery of the one-armed man while simultaneously evading Gerard's dogged pursuit. Along the way, however, Ford's version of Kimble follows in his television counterpart's footsteps as he changes his appearance and name to keep out of his pursuer's sight.  Yet, even as he risks life and liberty in his own investigation into who and why Helen was murdered, Kimble is true to his kind nature and his oath as a medical doctor, saving several people even at the risk of being discovered.  And as the good doctor closes in on the one-armed man, Gerard gets closer and closer to Kimble as the movie nears its revealing conclusion.
Davis and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy tweak with the television series a bit, telling the entire story in a briskly paced 130-minute-long film, making Gerard a U.S. Marshal instead of a local police lieutenant. Yet, despite the focus on action and the added conspiracy motive behind Helen Kimble's murder, The Fugitive stays true to the spirit of the TV show. Like David Jansen, Ford is an actor most audiences genuinely like and love to cheer for, and Kimble's predicament and preserverance suit him well in this movie.  Jones, too, gives his Gerard both a steely determination to fulfill his mission and a mixture of humor and compassion that surfaces at unexpected moments.
The 2001 Special Edition DVD presents The Fugitive in its original widescreen format. Its extra features include interactive menus, commentary by director Davis and Tommy Lee Jones, two documentaries, a theatrical trailer, and subtitles/language tracks in English and French.",1068163200,5,3126,5.060194174757282

Anyways, when I first saw it many years ago, I liked it. But then I realized how cool it was when I saw some of it on tv.
The movie is really good though. Harrison Ford plays a great guy, but hes on the run. I never really hated any of the characters until the end. Still, the movie is highly entertaining.

117288,5,079072961X,"One of the biggest box office smashes of the '90s, ""The Fugitive"" still firmly holds its ground as a thinking persons' action film, full of exciting story (based on the television show and the Alan Shepard murder case) and fine kinetic filmaking.  And who doesn't love Tommy Lee Jones (The Client, Men In Black) Harrison Ford (If you don't know one other movie he's in stop reading this review) as adversaries and seeming equals.  Plus the film boasts an up-and-coming Joe Pantoliano (of t.v.'s ""The Sopranos"" the new CBS drama ""The Handler"") as a member of Jones' crack U.S. Marshall unit.
The film kicks off as Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongly convicted of his wifes' murder, and escapes when his prison bus crashes and is destroyed by an oncoming train.  Soon on the scene is veteran U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard (Jones) to start his relentless hunt for Kimble.
What follows is an intense cat and mouse game, with Jones dogging Fords' every step and Ford risking almost certain recapture trying to clear his name.  Gifted Director Andrew Davis and his gifted team of editors and cinematographers take this premise and turn ""The Fugitive"" into a virtuostic piece of kinetic filmaking.  They stage one surprising and no holds barred chase after another, trying to top themselves at every turn and succeeding most of the time. A huge reason for this is Ford and Jones, the films' soul.  Jones won a deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar for his work playing a terrific hard-ass, and no one is better at playing sympathetic heroes than Harrison Ford, and he pulls out one of his best performances.",1064966400,2,1599,4.8388278388278385
117289,5,079072961X,"There is a kind of magic when a superb cast, a truly gifted director, and a literate script with equal parts 'over-the-top' action, riveting suspense, and rich characterization, come together. The end result attains a luster that only grows through the years, as new audiences, through DVD and VHS, experience the same excitement we felt, viewing it on a theater screen. In the last decade, only a handful of suspense films could be called 'great'...and on top of the list is THE FUGITIVE.
Based on the popular David Janssen TV series, the film faithfully follows the same premise; a doctor is convicted of his wife's death, but escapes before his execution, and tracks down the 'one-armed man' responsible for the murder, as a driven law officer attempts to recapture him. Being a big-budget film, however, the scale of everything is expanded...Dr. Richard Kimble is now a brilliant vascular surgeon, at a major Chicago hospital; the handicapped killer is a dirty ex-cop working on orders from crooked board members of a billion-dollar pharmaceutical firm; and the lawman is no longer a solitary police lieutenant, but a deputy United States Marshal, and his team of agents! While some fans of the original series complained that the 'intimacy' the series had was lost, director Andrew Davis only used the 'bigger' aspects as plot elements, placing the focus, wisely, on the dual stories of Kimble's search, and Gerard's pursuit.
Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role (earning him an Oscar as 'Best Supporting Actor'), Ford's intent wasn't to play 'Indiana Jones', but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon, and his wife (played, in flashbacks, by the lovely Sela Ward). Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting). His search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool. Fear does not lend itself to flashy theatrics...
Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark. Of COURSE he wins the audience's heart!
Featuring some of the most spectacular action scenes ever recorded on film (the train/bus wreck that frees Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.

117292,4,079072961X,"There's no question `The Fugitive' has become a timeless, talked-about thriller that virtually everyone has seen.  And there's great reason why everyone should see this movie.  It's has an excellent cast, good action, a great storyline, great thrills, and even bits of drama here and there.  The acting by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones obviously stands out, but it's the supporting roles of Joe Pantoliano (who actually brings some comedy to the film), Julianne Moore, and Jeroen Krabbe that help boost the movie's appeal.  There are so many infamous scenes and characterizations that it's even spawned a Leslie Nielsen parody movie, `Wrongfully Accused' (fitting name).  But that's neither here nor there.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're missing out on a brilliant piece of film.  Here's a rundown of the movie:
The movie starts with some in-and-out scenes, going from past to present.  We first see Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) at a party with his wife.  Then they leave, she gets murdered, and he gets blamed for it.  It's not really that fast, but it's hard to explain.  We then see Kimble being questioned by police and eventually convicted in a courtroom.  And although we know he's a loveable, sincere doctor, he actually looks like the Unabomber with his beard and distraught haircut.  So to the uninformed, he appears very guilty.  After all this has happened, we (the viewer) still KNOW he didn't do it; they make that very clear.  But as Kimble and fellow inmates are on a bus to be executed, something happens.  The bus crashes.  And although this particular scene is one of the most famous and best ever produced, it's a little unbelievable for it all to unfold as it did.  Nevertheless, it's an action-packed scene that really keeps you entertained.  As you can imagine, Kimble (and another guy) escape from the train wreck and go ""on the run"".  That's where Tommy Lee Jones comes in.  After he and his crew take the jurisdiction from some incompetent cops who didn't see the loose footcuffs, he orders people around using a speech that covers every possible scenario and every inch of ground.  In fact, the many speeches and directions he gives are awesome and very entertaining.  One of the reasons this movie is so impressive is because of the ongoing battle between Kimble and Samuel Gerard (Jones).  I'm calling it the battle of smart versus smart.  And that's fitting, because everywhere Kimble goes... there's Gerard.  One of those meetings between the two is also one of the greatest moments in film: the tunnel scene.  Again, it might be somewhat far-fetched, but it is still breathtaking.
Another bright spot within the film is the attention to detail.  If you listen and watch Gerard come up with his schemes for catching Kimble, you can't help but say ""wow"".  This is not your average cop-chasing-bad-guy-picking-up-clues-type movie.  It's much more than that.  There are numerous unpredictable turns that stand out in a movie that appears, at first glance, to be predictable.  Without those twists the movie would've been more average.  Now, even with the awesome twists and stellar action sequences, the movie isn't perfect.  There might be a few things the movie could've done without.  First, the flashbacks that Kimble has became a little annoying, though they were probably necessary.  And what about the people he contacted?  Wouldn't they be arrested for assisting in a crime?  In the end, I guess it doesn't really matter.
`The Fugitive' will no doubt entertain you; while keeping you just on the edge of your seat and ready for anything.  The acting by both Ford and Jones are flat-out amazing, and the supporting cast really adds to the brilliance it already possessed.  This movie is not too predictable, until the very end (how is supposed to end?).  The story is great, letting us wonder if Dr. Kimble's tragic loss was fate or a set-up.  I won't say anymore about the movie, but I will say you need to see it.  This is undoubtedly one of the must-see movies of the `90s.  Whether or not you like Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, action movies, thrillers, or just a great movie all in all, watch `The Fugitive'.  It has so many twists and turns that it'll leave you in awe and wanting more.",1051142400,,4242,4.838664812239221

117294,5,079072961X,"Loosely based on the 1954 murder case of Sam Sheppard - whose son fights to clear his father's name to this day - 1960s television created an added dose of drama by allowing The Fugitive (the late David Janssen) to escape from prison, and hunt down the man who murdered his wife in cold blood.
Perhaps never in the history of TV was a plotline so ripe for the treatment (and budget) afforded by the big screen - and, perhaps, never has it been done so well.
Harrison Ford plays Doctor Richard Kimble, a Chicago-area vascular surgeon (""What the hell is that?"" asks one of his pursuers. ""Someone who makes a lot more money than you,"" answers another in the easy, natural humor of two people who've worked together for years) who seems, at first, too good to be true. A philanthropist respected by the community, loved by his colleagues and adored by his wife, you can't help but wonder if there's trouble in paradise, despite the shadowy presence of Helen Kimble's (Sela Ward, bringing remarkable life to a dead woman, thanks to flashbacks) killer.
Chicago's finest quickly come to the same conclusion, and a damning 911 phone call by the dying victim seals Kimble's fate - a death sentence!
Fate, however, has other ideas. One of four survivors of the most spectacular - and controversial - train wreck ever captured on film, Kimble sets off to blend in to the Windy City's skyline long enough to find the man who took Helen from him. He has plenty of clues to start him on the trail; his biggest enemy not so much his pursuers as time itself.
Deputy United States Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), meantime, is as dogged as his prey; so determined to capture ""my man"" that, when confronted by the fugitive Kimble and his professed innocence, snaps back, ""I don't care!""
Though Gerard isn't ""out to solve a puzzle here,"" Kimble is, and with equal persistence. The plot that led to the death of his wife is revealed in tense, dramatic fashion to the audience as Kimble himself learns it - and learns who has betrayed him.
What remains, of course, is whether his time has run out.
Ford's Kimble is what many people would consider an oxymoron: A truly benevolent, honest doctor. Best known as the almost-reckless Indiana Jones, Ford plays Kimble as a highly intelligent man who uses his wits and a level head to keep one step in front of not one, but two groups of adversaries.
Hot on Kimble's heels, Jones' Gerard does Ford one better by creating a lawman walking the thin line between pursuit and obsession. ""Never argue with the big dog,"" Gerard admonishes his team, when Kimble shows up ""not dead yet"" - proof, yet again, that ""the big dog is always right.""
Hunter and prey, cat and mouse, Jones and Ford present real people trapped in a deadly game. The viewer quickly bonds with Kimble and roots for his success, while not quite able to root against Gerard. ""It's alright if you catch him,"" we seem to be saying, ""just, not yet!""
A supporting cast including Joe Pantoliano, Jeroen Krabbe and Julianne Moore (in a small, but pivotal role) is equally up to the task; never did anyone's performance feel like they were acting, and the rich range of emotions coupled with crisp pacing, a riveting storyline and a properly brassy soundtrack adds up to one of the finest films ever made.

And know he must prove his innocence to everyone including a U.S Marshal named Sam Gerard (Jones) who doesn't care about anything except catching Kimble. I don't know the bad guy's name but he was also the bad guy in the James Bond flick The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton. The movie is a pure blast of fun. Though really not for small children, people over 12 can watch this movie. It is not incredibly bloody and is a true masterpiece that deserves to be owned.
I give Fugitive 4 stars.

The Fugitive, which is based on a TV series, is the story of a Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a man wrongly convicted of brutally murdering his wife. After the bus carrying him to prison manages to crash into a train (impressive special effects on the crash scene), Kimble escapes then attempts to solve the mystery of who actually killed his wife. At the same time, however, he has to keep on the run from an obsessive detective (Tommy Lee Jones) who is as determined to find him as he is to stay free.
There are many exciting twists and turns in the plot, which involves a one-armed man and a medical fraud...and to say any more about it would be to give too much away. Anyhow, this is one of the best recent thrillers - it has some great scenes, good action sequences, some comic moments, great acting (Ford and Jones are perfect...you simply root for whoever is on screen at the time), and is not TOO violent (although some of the initial scenes which show the wife being murdered are pretty grusome). This is one of the few recent Hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves its popularity - see it and enjoy!",1028160000,4,1331,4.55

We all know the Academy is just a bunch of stuffy cronies who hate action films, so it's VERY surprising (and refreshing) to think that THE FUGITIVE was nominated for Best Film! Harrison Ford is his usual commanding self as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who we all know is wrongly acccused for the muder of his wife. Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Best Supporting Actor Award, is at his best as the cop trying to hunt Kimble down. Director Andrew Davis' approach to the material is superbly- crafted, with some incredible action set-pieces along the way. Jones reprised his role in U.S. MARSHALS, but the original is the best. One of the greatest action films of the 90s. The extras on the DVD are a great improvement from the original release, with a commentary from Davis and Jones (sadly, Ford is missing), two featurettes, trailers and more.",1026345600,,996,4.569832402234637

Dr. Kimble though must find a way to prove that he is innocent, and find the real killer.  This is just 2 hours of non stop excitement.
The sequel ""Us Marshalls"" is not even half as good.  I wouldn't recommend it.
Also the movie ""Wrongfully Accused"", which is a parody of this movie and a couple of others, was not that good, it had some good laughs but overall it wasn't worth it.",1024012800,,671,4.277777777777778
117306,5,079072961X,"If any TV series deserved the big screen treatment, it would have to be THE FUGITIVE.  This superb series, which starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, was a huge hit on the small screen.  And in 1993, it got to the big screen with excellent results.
Taking over from Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, who is arrested, tried, and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a murder that he did not commit.  On the way to an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers a catastrophic accident and a collision with a train.  Ford manages to escape, but now the feds, under the leadership of U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), are after him, and they are relentless.  Ford is forced to do whatever it takes to stay just out of the law's reach and not only find the one-armed assailant who actually killed his wife, but also why the murder even happened in the first place.
Without an unneccesary amount of graphic violence or out-of-control explosions, director Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE) manages to build suspense in the classic Hitchcock tradition.  Indeed, both the film and the TV series upon which it is based are superlative variations on a favorite Hitchcock theme--a man on the run for a crime he didn't commit.  If the plot seems a bit incredulous at times, this is only a minor flaw; and it is easily forgotten just watching Ford piece together a sinister puzzle to prove his innocence to everyone, especially the tenacious, hard-as-nails Jones.
Jones won a richly-deserved Oscar for his slightly sardonic performance as Sam Gerard, especially for his line about searching every ""warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, and doghouse"" after the train wreck.  But it is Ford who really carries this movie.  We sympathize with his plight and we are with him just about every step of the way.  Like Hitchcock's characters, as well as those in Spielberg's movies, we are put into the shoes of Ford's character and forced to think about what we might do if we were ever under the same kind of pressure.
THE FUGITIVE is vigorously recommended to anyone who appreciates good, old-fashioned suspense and thrills with believable characters and a believable plot.  Pick it up!",1022716800,2,2258,4.808785529715762
117307,3,079072961X,"This movie is based off of some 60's TV show of the same name (I've never seen this show, so I can't compare the two), which in turn, I've heard, is based off of a true story. Harrison Ford as Richard Kimble is perfect for the role, he's an action movie star who brings emotional conflict into his movies. You can always tell when he's angry. Tommy Lee Jones as U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard is also a perfect match. He's got a nice sense of humor when he's ordering his men around. They say that Richard is fish food after jumping off of the dam, Sam tells them to find the fish that ate him. He's obsessed and will stop at nothing to find Richard.
Richard Kimble was a happily married cardiovascular surgeon, but then one day he comes home to find his wife dying. He has a fight with the killer, a one armed man. The police don't belive him, so he's then convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to death. On the way to the prison, his bus crashes and he escapes along with some other prisoner. He's now on the run trying to find his wife's killer. Samuel Gerrard is also looking for him, and will stop at nothing to find him. Before he was sentenced, Richard was investigating a new ""wonder drug"" that causes liver damage, but someone was replacing the bad liver samples with good samples so the drug could be approved. He then figures out that the one armed hitman was after him, but he had a last minute operation, so the hitman killed his wife instead. He figures all of this out while avoiding Sam, and nearly gets caught again several times, once he had to jump off of a dam.
This film is one of the best movies, ever. I've watched it countless times and I'm not bored of it yet. If you want a good movie experience and a laugh or two, go pick this movie out.",1020384000,,1771,4.258160237388724

117310,1,079072961X,"Okay, ""The Fugitive"" had your standard action-pic thrills and a pretty good performance by Tommy Lee Jones. But really, this is a lousy movie for three reasons.
1. It's only about a guy running from the law and trying to clear his name. That was never the point of the TV series -- the series was all about putting the character into situations where he'd be thrown in with the poor or oppressed people of America -- abused women, Mexican farm workers, black brutality victims, the people who never showed up on ""Father Knows Best."" It was a show with a tremendous sense of adventure and conscience, whereas the movie chickens out, cuts the guts out of the ""Fugitive"" concept and just turns it into a will-he-or-won't-he-survive cliffhanger. It's mentally empty Hollywood schlock. Which would be fine if they hadn't called it ""The Fugitive.""
2. The train crash at the beginning (and in the trailer, so I'm not giving anything away) -- he really survived that? Give me a break.
3. When we find out the reason why somebody has hatched this evil plot against him, it's laughable. I'm sorry, this scheme would just never have happened in life -- it would easily have been found out and there's no incentive for someone to have cooked it up in the first place. This is lame screenwriting.",1014768000,9,1283,4.68141592920354
117311,5,079072961X,"I saw this movie shortly after it's release in 1993 and was immediately impressed by the great way the story was written, as well as the great acting. Many big screen movies drawn from tv series fall far short of the originals - in spite of excellent actors. A great example is 'The Avengers', a terrific tv series of the 60's that fell flat on it's face on the big screen, despite the magnificent Ralph Feinnes, the comely Uma Thurman, and the unforgettable Sean Connery. Not so 'The Fugitive'! This may well be one of the greatest action/dramas I've seen, and to date remains so.
The cat-and-mouse chase scenes between Ford and Tommy Lee Jones will literally keep you on the edge of your seat. Ford's brooding sincerity is perfectly counterpointed by Jones' dogged intensity. Highlighted by James Newton Howard's riveting score, this movie quite literally has no dull moments.
One of the best features on the DVD is a scene-by-scene commentary (of the complete film) between Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones. The viewer is led through each scene as it unfolds, with Davis explaining how the scene was done, as well as commenting on the various actors in each scene. Davis naturally does most of the talking, with Tommy adding a comment here and there. Through this process the viewer is led on a fascinating journey into the creative processes in the making of a great film.

He's an innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife(Sela Ward). While being transported, the jail van gets in an accident and the good doctor escapes.

With great special effects (that's a real train and bus) this movie makes it worth while to buy it. There are some plot issues, only to keep the movie short enough not to lose intrest, but the conviction of the good Dr. is a little quick and it intrest piques as to what his defense was, and how the prosecutor really convinced the jury that he was guilty. The movie bases the survival of the good Dr. on the fact that with only the knowledge of innocence can motivate you to jump off a 100 foot sewege drain, in order to be free, only to run back to the lion's den and try and prove your innocence.

117314,4,079072961X,"When I first saw 'The Fugitive', I was hoping that it didn't fall into the trap of silliness that most TV-show based feature films have fallen into (remember 'Car 54', or 'Wild Wild West'?). Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised to see that it went WAY beyond my low expectations! Great moments of suspense, action, and plot twists galore!

Harrison Ford's been knocked for not putting much 'feeling' into some of his roles. But if there are emotions he does do well, it's desperation and determined stoicism with a touch of sarcasm... a perfect fit for a fugitive out to clear his name. As well, Tommy Lee Jones is a lock as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard- he plays the character's somewhat cocky and no-nonsense attitude to perfection. He also gets the best lines, and a pretty good supporting cast playing his U.S. Marshal Service cohorts (including the recently- recognized Joe Pantoliano). It's scenery-chewing at it's best, and definitely an Oscar-worthy perfomance.

 Their performances of the two main characters and antagonists is so compelling that, like my fellow reviewers have stated before, I was rooting for the both of them throughout the presentation. It's two 'good guys' against each other, with one helping lead the other to the same end!

 When I heard about the Special Edition DVD release, I was kinda bummed. I'd already spent a few bucks on the original release, and never anticipated the possibility of an enhanced version. But, thanks to those wonderful buyers on eBay, I got a good return on my original disc at a minimal loss, and grabbed a copy of the new one.

 The new  disc isn't half-bad, but doesn't quite match up to the standards of other fully-loaded DVD fare as `T2 Ultimate Edition' or `The Abyss'. It features teasers, trailers, and a few behind-the-scenes bits, including the setup & shooting of the train wreck. Davis even discusses a `flub' following the wreck that was cut out of the original video version, but was then digitally corrected and restored in this DVD release! And no, I'm not gonna tell you about it- you'll have to see it for yourself!

 The commentary track by director Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones was not one of the better feature-length commentaries I've experienced. There are parts where neither of them speak for a couple minutes on end, almost like they didn't have that much to say about the movie in the first place. Jones' commentary was minimal, with mostly throwaway-type observations that didn't really add much to the track.

 And now, my biggest gripe: Warner is STILL using cardboard snap cases for their digital discs! You'd think they'd've gotten out of the DVD Stone Age by now...

Back in the day, Wednesday morning school was dominated by the discussion of the latest episode of ""The Fuge"" from the night before. This is the only film I can think of which actually did justice to the classic television show from which it sprang.
Tommy Lee Jones is a fantastic U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard. He appears not to be obsessed with the capture of Dr. Kimble (as was his television predecessor, portrayed by Barry Morse). Nonetheless, we get the feeling that he brings the same determination to every case he has. Ford once again is the ""everyman"" (if a doctor who gets sent to prison for killing his wife and then escapes can be thought of in those terms) who prevails through all manner of adversities. [As an aside, I wonder how well Ford could stretch himself - could he ever be convincing as a real bad guy, like a John Malkovich or Anthony Hopkins?]
This movie has a lot of pluses. It is a great story, updated from one of the sixties' best shows.  Sure, there were great stunts. The bus crash/train wreck was stunning (made even more so by seeing Ford almost comically hobbling along, trying to outrun the carnage while wearing leg shackles).
However, it is the competition between the two dogged adversaries Jones and Ford that makes this work. They are one real pair of incredibly strong personalities- (and screen presences) Nothing better than the sequence in the dam early on with Ford protesting his innocence and Jones equally sincere reply ""I don't care"". Both smart, even though Jones hides his behind a gruff and self-deprecating exterior. The good and decent Doc must be determined (after all, it is his can on the line), but seeing him persevere - hiding his own persona in a hospital, evading the police while tracking down the one armed man is intense, even though we know the outcome.
Great editing; especially when we think the Marshals are getting close to the big bust, and we find out that they are actually making a collar across town.

117331,5,079072961X,"Roy Huggin's '60s TV series is successfully updated to the big screen.  Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble as a surgeon wrongfully accused of murdering his wife, and thanks to an incredible bus crash/train wreck scene, goes on the lam.  However, make no mistake about it, the real acting draw for this film is Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Girard, the half-boiled U.S. marshall.  When Girard and his team arrive at the accident scene and he delivers the line, ""My, my, my, my, my.  What a mess,"" you know immediately that Jones is going to steal the show.  I also liked Kimble's level-headed intelligence.  Instead of simply evading the law, he's trying to clear his name.  As he learns the truth about the crime, so do we - the script is not overt in revealing plot threads.  Together, Jones and Ford form an intriguing cat-and-mouse game that will keep you engrossed.

I viewed the movie shortly afterwards and was impressed by the way the movie writers left the storyline intact, of course with present day updating. The Fugitive is one of many past television-series-turned-movie, and is one of the best; I would also suggest Mission:Impossible. I thought it was amazing that the entire series was summarized in 1 movie. Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect antagonist (as usual). This movie is wonderful; get the sequel US Marshalls to complete the set.",980035200,,594,4.891089108910891
117333,4,079072961X,"I like this movie more now than I did the night I first saw it.  Back then, the flashbacks irritated me, Julianne Moore's aborted presence frustrated me because I knew she'd done more, and the whole concept of Kimble's primary nemesis not being the one-armed man but a friend and colleague (the cynical 90s -- betrayal and conspiracy) still rankles.
Nevertheless, the intelligence of Kimble and Girard, and the taut pacing, make this one thriller that I really can't help but enjoy seeing often.  (I only hope that Ford one day receives the career recognition that Jones already has.  True, it was Jones' lacing his character with flashes of wit that likely earned him the Oscar, but Ford's intensity and the empathy he draws from the viewer are also admirable and contribute greatly to the movie's impact.)",979084800,,807,4.875912408759124

Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.
Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly. Its a real winner! A classic masterpiece which earnt Tommy Lee Jones an oscar for Best Actor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",970790400,2,903,4.65
117335,4,079072961X,"Since Star Wars, Ford has tried to shed the persona of his ""space cowboy,"" and tried roles from an archaelogist, all the way to becoming the Leader of the Free World.  However, ""The Fugitive"" has got to be one of his top 5.  After being accused of murdering his wife, Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) escapes a closecall with a train.  After discovering Kimball and another fugitive may be alive, US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) begins a manhunt that leads to Chicago, where Ford is trying to track down the identity of his wife's murderer, as well as finding a strange twist.  The film has a solid script and delves into the chase as Gerard soon finds that Kimball may have been telling the truth (that is, if the Chicago Police don't find him first and kill him).  ford has a couple of close calls, and there the plot kind of goes a tad askew.  At some points, sevral areas are left wide open and Ford casually walks through a building's orthopedics clinic without even being noticed.  another slight skew is when Jones's character tracks down the other fugitive,seemingly deviating from the story of Richard Kimball.  In the end, it is a rather enjoyable movie, and James Newton Howards's Score is awesome to listen to riding the El trains.",970444800,,1257,4.656108597285068

Also, you root for  Gerard and all his staff. How did they manage to get such a great  supporting cast for this movie? Not that I'm complaining.
The big stunts  are spectacular. But each time I watch this, I most want to see the  staircase chase again. Not to mention the part right after that where  Kimble eludes Gerard by... OK, I'm not going to give that part away.
I  just wish they'd make a *real* sequel to this. one with both Tommy Lee  Jones and Harrison Ford.

117343,5,079072961X,"One of the greatest thrillers of all time, The Fugitive is a textbook example of a thriller that keeps its audience glued without insulting their intelligence.  Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a Chicago surgeon, is  wrongly convicted of killing his wife (Sela Ward), escapes from prison and  heads back to his hometown in search of the real killer, a mysterious  one-armed man that Kimble struggled with in his house after his wife's  murder.  U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his Oscar-winning  role) and his deputies relentlessly pursue Kimble in and around Chicago,  always staying a few steps behind.
This movie works on so many levels,  but it begins with the actors.  Harrison Ford, is one of his best roles,  perfectly portrays the dignity and righteous indignation that Kimble feels.  He should have received an Oscar nomination for the sheer physical and  emotional effort that he put into this character.  Jones is a perfect  choice for Gerard: He is relentless, shrewd and sarcastic in his quest to  track down Kimble.  He always projects a smarmy, superior quality that  attracts the viewer, yet makes us want him to lose his prey.  The terrific  supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Daniel Roebuck,  and Jeroen Krabbe.
Director Andrew Davis takes the audience along for the  chase, and uses Chicago as his landscape, including a busy St. Patrick's  Day Parade for one scene. These locations enhance the film by using the  city as a maze through which this chase occurs.  Another terrific feature  is James Newton Howard's score, which manages to add color and tension to  scenes, even when there is no dialogue. Perfect all around, from acting,  directing, composing and screenplay, The Fugitive should remain a  classic.

117352,5,079072961X,"""The Fugitive"" is what many adventure films wish they could be:  Well-directed, finely casted, intelligently written.  Never have I sat through a film that engulfs its viewer on a manhunt while the pursued  voraciously searches for evidence to prove his innocence in the shadow of  his beautiful wife's murder.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are  stunning and captivating in their respective roles.  Though they are on the  opposite ends of the law, you root for them nevertheless because somewhere  in the film the real criminal basks in his ""perfect""  crime.
Thank goodness Harrison Ford was casted into this role as the  wrongly-accused Dr. Richard Kimble.  He should've been the first choice  considered over conceited and self-absorbed Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin was  originally casted before Ford, but ostentatiously withdrew believing  ""The Fugitive"" was a go-nowhere role for his so-called career.  Shows how much he knows.  Ford has far more appeal and true connection with  a film going audience and succeeds at gaining sympathy and respect in his  hunt of the real culprit.
""The Fugitive"" was deservedly  nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and though it did not garner the  prestigious award, the film is a masterfully well-crafted film only  intelligent director Andrew Davis could weave together.

It  doesn't stop there though, we see Harrison go over a dam and struggle to  survive in the shadows of Chicago. Based on the TV series, David Twohy  breathes new life into the man-against-the-world premise. Harrison is in  top form, perhaps in the best character piece of his career. Dr. Richard  Kimble is a beleivable character. He's not a Superman, but a smart man with  steely survival instincts. The most hair-raising moments are the many in  which you think he's had it, they're gonna get him for sure, but no, he  slips between their fingers like sand in an hour glass. My single complaint  is that I still don't quite understand why he was set up. They very briefly  cover something about a new drug, and I think Dr. Kimble had something to  do with it's testing, but from there it's blurry. Also the DVD itself could  use some spiffing up.
