I have watched it several times, and picked up little things I missed before. Michael has unlimited talent and I think this was one good movie of his.

7907549,5,B00000F0M8,"If you like cop movies with tons of action, this one is for you! The story line is interesting and the acting is very convincing. I definately agree that this movie is a showcase for Michael Biehn - he's at his best in every sense of the word.",1010448000,,243,4.083333333333333
7907550,4,B00000F0M8,"this is not a capital G great movie - but it is a fun action/cop/ buddy movie that ANY fan of Michael Biehn should enjoy.  I actually like it better each time i see it - sure, its a bit predictible but - i guess i'd rather that than some of the stuffy  movies that the ""Critics"" like - it has humor - action and Michael - whats not to like???",995500800,,342,3.8028169014084505
7907551,3,B00000F0M8,"For Michael Biehn fans (Terminator, Navy Seals, The Rock) this is  a terrific showcase for his physical action/emotionally wounded style.  It's a typical detective/buddy flick, with an interesting juxtaposition of Chinese and Italian mobsters.  Michael's in top form, and is great fun to watch.",979689600,,294,5.636363636363637
