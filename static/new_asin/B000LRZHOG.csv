2713037,5,B000LRZHOG,we had just purchased a bluray player and wanted a Bollywood movie to wach.  Unfortunately the selection wasn't too varied but we picked this and really enjoyed it.,1286668800,,164,4.857142857142857
2713038,3,B000LRZHOG,"As a Bollywood version of a slam-bang action-packed mindless fun ride, DHOOM 2 certainly delivers. It's got mad (sometimes CGI-aided, sometimes not) stunts, high-octane action sequences, some cute comedy bits, and very catchy musical numbers extremely-well danced. It's got a talented and engaging cast with Abhishek Bachan returning as ""Supercop"" Jai Dixit and Uday Chopra as his comic relief partner Ali, the charismatic and athletic Hritikh Roshan as gentleman ""Superthief"" Mr. A, the stunning Aishwarya Rai as cocky female thief Sunehri who has some secrets of her own, and Bipasha Basu in a fun double role as Dixit's college sweetheart Deputy Superintendent Sonali Bose and her comically Americanized sister/cousin/who cares Monali - so Ali can have a love interest just as silly as himself for once! As Indian fans have pointed out, the only thing missing is a coherent script - there are excellent dramatic and romantic bits as well as the expected action and comedy ones, but the plot barely holds together and doesn't even pretend to have more than a vague acquaintance with its predecessor, DHOOM.

Even so, I'd have given this movie four stars rather than three simply because it's a delightful example of its genre-bending - a hilariously testosterone'd cop adventure, with singing, dancing and get-out-your-hankies melordrama. However, it appears that Amazon has misrepresented this as a two-disc set, when there's only one disc in the package. I sent the first one back and got a (one-disc) replacement, so I know it wasn't just a glitch in shipping - they're not selling the two-disc set advertised at double the cost of the one-disc set also available here. If Amazon would fix that, I would happily up my review....",1275264000,4,1733,5.1453900709219855
2713039,5,B000LRZHOG,"This movie is a great entertainment - lots of eye candy as all of the cast is in incredible shape and knows how to show it :-), fantastic dance choreography, fashion details and catchy music, creative plot and ending ... .

As to movie itself - good attempt to have full of actions movie, with usual love-romance Bollywood spin. Great songs and fantastic dancing - makes you to get of the couch and jump around!

2713041,5,B000LRZHOG,"Action has long been a flourishing genre in Bollywood, but it is perhaps the genre least associated with Hindi film in the minds of Westerners. But however incongruent action and musical numbers may seem at first, the two are perfect compliments--both are spectacles, after all--as evidenced in any number of Hindi action flicks, including one of the finest, 'Dhoom 2.'

It doesn't happen often, but sometimes the sequel is better than its predecessor, and while the action hit 'Dhoom' (2004) is solidly entertaining, the second installment far surpasses it.

Abhishek Bachchan reprises his role as police detective Jai Dixit. Uday Chopra is back as Ali, a reformed small-time crook who has earned a spot on the police force. Rimi Sen returns, briefly, as Jai's wife Sweety, who is now pregnant and even more relegated to the sidelines of Jai's life than she was in the first movie.

Three new characters are introduced. Shonali (Bipasha Basu) is a police investigator and Jai's old college friend. Ali--still a failure with women but ever hopeful--has a major crush on her, but she only has eyes for Jai. His marriage is in no danger though--at least from infidelity--Jai is as indifferent to Shonali's charms as he is to his wife's. The two villains are Aryan (Hrithik Roshan), known in the beginning only as ""A,"" a tech wiz and master of disguises who breaks into high-security places all over the world, and Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai), a copycat thief who's trying to beat Aryan to the prizes.

Aryan is a bored genius who craves stimulation and only feels challenged by near-impossible heists. At different times, he impersonates a goofy teenager, an austere priest, a doddering janitor, and Queen Elizabeth II. Roshan assumes each identity with a glee that reveals Aryan's childlike spirit. Physically, though, he's quite a specimen of a man, and he shows off his ripped bod every chance he gets. He develops a white-hot connection with Sunehri, his adversary-turned-partner, who impresses him with her boldness, tenacity, and stunning beauty. (The two share a passionate kissing scene that was controversial because of its intensity.)

Once again, the dull, glum Jai seems like no match for the colorful criminals, but he's sneaky smart, always thinking several moves ahead of his opponent--and the audience. Jai and Ali follow the thieves from Mumbai to Rio, where they are planning to steal rare coins from a museum. ('Dhoom 2' was the first major Hindi film to be shot in Brazil, where Bollywood is quite popular.)

When Aryan and Sunehri aren't snatching priceless valuables and running from the cops, they burst into song, to revel in all the fun they're having. Roshan dances with rubbery, muscled abandon, and Rai swirls in his arms--not in saris but sassy outfits--to catchy pop tunes on MTV-style sets--before dashing off again, with Jai hot on their heels.

2713042,4,B000LRZHOG,"Despite the corny, unrealistic action moves (especially the beginning) it was really enjoyable to watch this cops and robbers chase from India into Brazil. The love story was irresistible as well, with a believable performance by both Aishwarya and Hrithik.",1259020800,,257,5.45
2713043,4,B000LRZHOG,"I am by no means a Bollywood fanatic, but since I work with indians where I'm at, I dabble from time to time(Just for a background):

I had become a fan of Aishwarya Rai through some of her other movies, and that was my inspiration to purchasing here. As stunning as she is visually, she can be a bit stiff with her acting...But I was pleased by the results.

The film opens with a fantastic heist sequence that would be good even in Hollywood standards, though some of the sequence is a bit over the top, it sets a good tone. The main theme that begins and ends the film is then played...Easily the best song of the movie, with great energy to set the tone for the movie. The plot surrounds Mr. A(ryan)as the worlds greatest thief, Sunehri a competing theif that yearns for Mr. A's attention, and Jai, Shonali, and Ali as the police trying to catch him.

The Heist sequences are all rather innovative, and the music, while not spectatularly stimulating lyrically, serve to add the comic relief or romance required. The dramatic elements do provide irony and recall Heat and Italian Job/Ocean's 11/12/13 with some of the setups. The scenes between the theives really are the heart of this film, and one in particular really stole the film...It was one of the best scenerios and most emotionally charged moments I have seen in any movie, and to that I commend it. The comedy of the Cops is enjoyable yet sometimes forced, but is also expected from a Bollywood film. The actual storyline without the music could have created a more focused film, but that is just me with a Hollywood mind sense of film making.

The film is very enjoyable, and if you are new to the Bollywood experience, I would say this is a good start, as it does its best to be a western film. The 4/5 is given due to some of the flow of the film stalling from the required music of Bollywood. I really enjoyed the film as a whole, and I do not mind the musical fusion that is involved, it is a part of the culture, but I also feel that it could be blended better than this film provided. I did enjoy it, and will watch the film again in the future, as the the characters and story are solid, I just can not offer 5 stars when there are blemishes showing.

Please view it for yourself and decide for yourself...The good clearly outweigh the bad.",1257292800,2,2312,4.392523364485982

Did not think he could top the writing (then I watched Dhoom 3. I was speechless at the end and could not stop thinking about it for days). This movie and the next in the series will keep you and your friends talking about it for many days. We want more from this writer and the director. Won't leave out the one responsible for casting. What a great team. You will find yourself trying to learn dances you normally would not do and singing songs you don't even know the lyrics for. All around super movie.

Dhoom 2 and 3 were strikingly similar in story, though the details had been changed and Dhoom3, in all its ridiculousness is the superior tale. That said, I haven't seen the original Dhoom yet, that is up next so I can get to know Jai and Al's origin story. I do like the actor who plays Mr A in Dhoom 2, yet he is no Aamir Khan.

2713090,5,B000LRZHOG,"I have to confess I originally viewed this movie on Netflix but loved it so much I had to purchase my own copy - and I'm so glad I did.

Dhoom 2 (the entire Dhoom trilogy, really) could be called a buddy cop movie. And it is. However, if you're unfamiliar with Hindi language films then you're in for a buddy cop film unlike any you've ever seen. Jai (Abhishek Bachchan)and his funny partner Ali (Uday Chopra) work for Mumbai police when they are tasked with catching a master thief, the mysterious 'A' (Hrithik Roshan). This international thief has been robbing his way across the globe in bold, daring heists. He's cunning and elusive and hides in plain sight. An old college from of Jai's, Shonali (Bipasha Basu), also joins the team to catch 'A'. However, what better way to catch a thief than with another thief? Enter Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai).

This movie takes views from Mumbai all the way to Rio. While there is plenty of action on trains, on motorcycle, over cliffs, you name it, this movie also has strong romantic elements and is a surprisingly feel-good film. The showdown between 'A' and Jai is fantastic. I really couldn't guess what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the unpredictability of it. Some of the stunts were a bit unbelievable but honestly that just made me love the movie more. It has just the right amount of goofiness.

Then there are the music numbers (5 of them). This song has really catch songs (especially 'Touch Me') as well as fantastic choreography and very colorful costumes. I really loved the pageantry of it all. The acting is good too. I don't think any of these actors should win an award for their performances but they all did a great job. Roshan in particular is wonderful to watch. The man can seriously dance. His character dynamics with Bachchan's Jai was awesome, too. And Aishwarya Rai and Bipasha Basu are both so beautiful it just bowls me over. Wow.

This is a movie I can watch over and over again because it entertains in so many ways. I love Dhoom 2!",1409270400,,2009,4.572222222222222

This I think is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Indian cinema and is definately better than the first Dhoom movie. Ash and Hrithik's chemistry onscreen is amazing and they make a perfect couple on screen,1406073600,,368,4.590909090909091

However, if you're a fan of musicals from Hollywood's Golden Age (1930s to the 1950s,) then you'll love India's Bollywood version.  The plot might be predictable, and at times ridiculous, but the music and dancing are marvelous.  Hrithik Roshan is one of the most gifted dancers I've ever seen.  He combines the athleticism of Gene Kelly with the grace of Fred Astaire.  This movie is definitely family friendly.  Despite the fact the overarching storyline is about the police chasing after a master thief, there is very little violence (by American standards) and no gratuitous sex scenes (the physical relationships are left to your imagination.)

They both look super hot in this movie! The style is modern and sexy, the music is awesome, the musical numbers are fantastic. I would recommend this movie for someone who likes actions movies and comedy at the same time. But if you're one of those people who are too serious then don't get it.

2713112,5,B000LRZHOG,"Very fun Bollywood version of a Hollywood Blockbuster film.  Some great singing and dancing, Aishwarya Rai is gorgeous as usual, only campiness in regards to the makeup and green screen, but it's played for laughs and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Check it out!",1361750400,,267,5.045454545454546
2713113,5,B000LRZHOG,"Okay, as I've said before I believe that to truly get maximum pleasure out of a cinematic experience, one must first accept the film for what it is. If you go to a Summer Blockbuster expecting a transformative piece of art, then you'll be disappointed. That said, the Summer Blockbuster shouldn't be dismissed either, just coordinating the stunts and explosions is hard work, and they still entertain. Let me put it another way, Da Vinci created art that set the standard for centuries, Andy Warhol made a statement with a Campbell's soup can, both are the masters of their unique artistic spectrums.

This is my long-winded way of saying Dhoom 2 is a darn good Campbell's soup can. Does it have an impressive script? Nope. Are the characters well developed? Not particularly. Does this movie make you think? Definitely not! It does entertain you and that's the point of a great action flick.

This was also my first time seeing Abhishek Bachchan (the son of legendary Amitabh Bachchan, and now hubby to Aishwarya Rai) and I have to admit it took seeing a few Salman Khan movies to appreciate that he's not quite as dull as my first impression said he was. Only Mr. Salman Khan is a worse dancer, with a more limited emotional acting range. (Just my personal opinion and he has produced some AWESOME movies) Sad to say, although Mr. Bachchan Jr. is technically the ""hero"" in this film he's swallowed up by the charisma of his future bride, and Mr. Roshan. Jai Dixit has only three emotions, anger, disgust, and contempt. Contempt is the one he offers to friends and loved ones. All others get disgust and anger.

Uday Chopra has such a bad reputation as an actor and it's *completely* undeserved! I cheerfully admit that Ali irritates the heck out of me, and if I hadn't seen him in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mohabbatein-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B0010SAG28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mohabbatein Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pyaar-Impossible/dp/B0032M74ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pyaar Impossible</a>&nbsp;(which he wrote) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mujhse-Dosti-Karoge-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B000JLSRA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mujhse Dosti Karoge Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles</a>&nbsp;I'd fall victim to categorize him as an over-the-top actor as well. But the truth is he's a dang genius who not only writes and directs movies but he's developed his own comic book company! Unfortunately, even in his native land he's lampooned as an acting failure, and it's widely reported that he won't act in any other films aside from the Dhoom franchise. Since his work will be focused behind the camera from now on, I urge people to not judge him solely as Ali and give his other work a shot both on screen and off.

Bipasha Basu has a double role as ACP Shonali Bose and her twin sister Monali. I have to say, she is a beautiful lady, but as an actress and a dancer she leaves me cold. As Shonali she's more repressed than any Vulcan and not nearly as interesting. And there's the fact that she shamelessly flirts with soon-to-be-father, and very married Jai (who himself deserves worst-husband-of-the-century) without any real sparks. As Monali she's slightly more engaging because it's fun to watch Jai's reactions to her air-headedness. It's the only time in the movie that Mr. Bachachan Jr. conveys any genuine emotion (disgust). However, there is one reason she deserves a little shout out. According to reports she lived on oranges for four days before her bikini shots. I don't care what they'd pay me there's no way I'd EVER do that! I hope they paid her well.

I have to say that my main interest in this movie was born from falling in love with Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jodhaa-Akbar-Three-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0015B04EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. Frankly they're the reason this film works as well as it does. Without these two playing the antagonists there's nothing to lose myself in as an audience. Ali is simply too foolish, and Jai is so cardboard that I have absolutely no way of connecting to them emotionally. Normally, I'd blame this on the script, but in this case it boils down it the illusive, indefinable, ""IT"" factor. Mr. Bachchan Jr. simply doesn't have ""IT"" in this film, meanwhile Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai have so much ""IT"" that it allows them to take two character outlines and make you care without knowing anything about them. We're never told why they do what they do, we're never told how they became what they are, we're never even privy to their surnames! It doesn't matter, once Sunehri and Aryan come together it's their movie.

One can't talk about this movie without discussing the infamous kiss between Ms. Rai and Mr. Roshan, what to people in the USA would regard as something chaste and benign was called up before the courts in India, recently the now Mrs. Bachchan has said that she had her doubts the kiss would be well received when she did it, and felt the hoopla proved her right. Frankly, I was disappointed that felt that way because it's a gorgeous scene, but I give her kudos for going for it despite her reluctance.

Ms. Rai's portrayal of Sunerhi is a demonstration of just how good of an actress she is. She's one of a very select group of actors who understand and use their eyes and bodies to their full potential in a performance. Now you might think I've lost my marbles for this one but hear me out... Look at a film like the incomparable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guzaarish-English-Subtitles/dp/B004IM2M70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guzaarish (English Subtitles)</a>&nbsp;and notice how she's used her voice differently, her gait and her body language is different, even the way she sits and eats are totally different. Guzzarish is the superior film and role no question, but it's equally hard to create something out of fluff. It's true Sunehri's primary function in the film is to be the sexy temptress, but Ms. Rai embraces the role, and retains her own elegance and innate dignity, which makes her the perfect mate for Aryan. My one complaint is that her dancing talent is tragically misused by the choreographer. She should have been able to bust out some flashy moves on par with her leading man. If you have the two best dancers in film paired with each other USE THE OPPERTUNITY. Her great dancing moments are during the end credits!

Which brings me to Mr. Roshan, he's labeled as a so-called ""negative character"" but to me he's the real hero here. His character, unlike Jai Dixit has no backstory whatsoever. He's as mysterious at the end of the movie as he is at it's start, but his emerald eyes pull you into his heart and the way his brain works. Considering he has less dialogue than any other character Mr. Roshan has to rely on his face and body for the bulk of his performance. This is why he's rightly hailed as ""India's most complete actor"" I've yet to see any other Bollywood actor with a more thorough understanding of how to convey emotion through his eyes. To tell the truth, I can't think of many actors in this day and age anywhere who approach Mr. Roshan's talent of expression. It's this talent that ground Mr. A as a person, otherwise the character and his robberies would be so fantastical that he'd be just as remote as Jai Dixit. Since Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai share the same level of talent, they're able to bring a certain level of depth to the movie without destroying the ""good time, no thinking, all entertainment, purpose of the film."" Oh and he deserves all the applause in the world for the makeup and disguises he dons in this. The man had to get acrylic nails! Speaking as someone who's endured the horror of acrylic nails, my heart bled for him! I assure you, they're far worse than hanging off a cliff.

As far as the soundtrack goes, it's the perfect score for the movie. The songs are sexy without being vulgar. They're perfect for a rocking party, and a great blend of the Hindi film experience and spicy Latin beats of Carnival. The only weak track for me was Touch Me Don't Touch Me, but that might be because it's the only dance number I didn't like.

One quick note about the basketball game, my mother (Mrs. My-High School-Records-Still-Stand) bashes the basketball game every time she sees it. For any purists, it's NOT supposed to be a good game, it's supposed to be sexy and it IS! Lighten up and enjoy it okay.",1359676800,,8755,5.1375438596491225

2713117,5,B000LRZHOG,"This was my first Bollywood experience, and it was an amazing one! I've always had an interest in Bollywood movies, and finally convinced myself to watch one. Also, I watched this movie without the english subtitles first to see how much of it I could pick up. This made the experience even better! When I watched it the second time with the subtitles, I could pick up important plot details, but it was still easy enough to figure it out without the subtitles. At any rate...how was the movie? Great in every aspect! The actors and actresses all did very well! The women were beautiful but also have some skillz! Bips did so well in her dual role that when I watched without subtitles, I wondered ""What happened? Complete turnaround in personality!"" Later, I found out it was a twin sister, so she played two different roles very well. Ash was sensational and the scene where she and Roshan are playing Russian Roulette with the bullet was the best of the movie. Uday was hilarious, and you can't help but laugh at his clumsiness. Bachran was good as the straight cop and his wife ""Sweety"" is hilarious. But, yes, Roshan stole the show. He was made for this role, and I actually found myself rooting for him! I was glad that it ended with no one getting killed and Jai Dixit was gracious to let the two go. I'm hoping they come out with a part 3, though, and Aryan and Sunehra return as villains. We want more! We want more!

Also, the musical scores were great and the dancing out of this world! Good to see real actors and actresses multi-talented and unafraid to make fun of themselves. Hollywood should be ashamed. I think I'm converting to Bollywood now. Where have you been all my life?

Gosh I am still in awe with this movie!  There was so much balance with Bollywood style of plot, solid packed action, music and dancing that whipped me of the chair and of course romance based on trust and inevitably love!  Only HR and AR could pull it off!  Action scenes were remarkable taking you in believing you were right there with them experiencing every moment or have the guts to experience.  Hollywood should take a step back and take a few lessons in regards to exploiting sex, violence and romance on a film.  We've all seen scenes of ""Russian Roulette"", but the scene shown in this film, in my opinion, was so freaking intense HR had me in tears at the end!  The eyes of the actors were fierce with so much expression and conveyance; it was totally explosive between them.

The music and dance, a[...] it; they should make it a pill and call it Dhoom Machale ~ I would love to see today's youth challenge it...they would have a blast!!!

It is one of those Bollywood classics that is full of great music, dancing and some pretty serious eye candy.  Hrithik Roshan has to be one of the most gorgeous males on this planet.  I could write pages about his delicious green eyes. This is not a movie you watch if you want serious CGI and believable scripts.  That's not what Bollywood is about.  They are all about deliberately giving you a very energetic trip in the opposite direction of reality.
