I love that there is a show that has a queer sensibility... kids of straight folks will like it too... it's just fun. Our kid sings all the songs, does the word challenges, says goodbye to Dottie when she has to go. I would love to see more episodes of this show. If you would like to have something to show your kids that is FUN, CUTE, IMAGINATIVE, PLAYFUL and a TOUCH of QUEER SENSIBILITY... you should definitely get this. Support this very creative team, and lets hope there is a PBS show in the future that is so great.",1254009600,2,603,4.206896551724138
8639293,5,B001NZ3DR8,"Our boys love Dottie's Magic Pockets.  They enjoy the songs and sing them over and over again.  The stories are fun and creative.  Our boys have loved the show since they were 2 and 4, and a year later they still ask to watch it all the time.  We love that the show represents gay families so that our boys see that there are other kids with two moms or twos dads.  However, the show does a great job of representing gay and lesbian families without the show being about gay and lesbian families. All kids will love this show!",1231286400,4,526,4.22
