2460414,5,B000CEV3RS,"Taking a ichi the killeresque/fight club kind of story, mixed with a fantastic array of long takes and shots, this director who is used to doing music videos and commercials makes a fantastic debut into this kind of industry.

The start of the movie which is a mix of scenes shoots us into a very realistic movie.  The characters are very easy to attach to and although a bit cartoony in the beggining begins to engage us into its loop.

Based on a manga by Santa Inuoe who is known for his Tokyo Tribes manga currently done by Tokyo pop, this was an adaption made from a manga done back in 1993.  The style of art wasn't pleasing to my visual pallete but the movie itself was very good to its form.

The DVD is awesome, my 2 disk edition came with a Tshirt saying ""Caution:  May contain homicidal murderer"" with the movies mascot on a white triangle.  It includes some amusing previews but has a large making of, from manga to screen, and a bunch of MYV promotional things. I was a bit upset by the lack of deleted scenes (they involved Kaneda AKA takashi miike)  but the quality of the other extras plus image gallery balanced it out.

The dubbing was also quite good, although not as good as the original cast in its original language, was not bad to the casual dubbed watcher.

I bought it because of the shirt, and was very happy at after watching the movie.  You'll laugh a few times at the dark humor and be emersed in the suspense the movie has to offer.

Enjoy it!  I know I did.",1144540800,12,1488,4.309352517985611
2460415,2,B000CEV3RS,"First time director attempt to  deliver a twisted tale of troubled young psychopath who was tormented by a bully who scars the boy both mentally and physically. This leads to him to create a split personality that brings out a violent side when angry and or bullied. Although the movie is violent, the scenes are rather spread out and far an few in between. It plays out more of a drama then a a revenge flick full of blood and gore. When it comes down to it , the movie had potential but falls flat due to horrible pacing.",1139270400,,523,4.282828282828283
8098254,2,B000CEV3RS,"DVD Review: Tokyo Shock version. 2 Disc set. Depending what you get, you'll get a tee-shirt with the package, a documentary, MTV thing, deleted scenes, making of and some sneak peek thing. The picture quality is good and audio is good.

Movie Review: SO(!!!!!!!!!!) did I watch a paradox, a delusion or WHAT?!?!? I don't get it. I thought the majority of the movie was the reality until I read the opinions of these people saying that the final moments of the movie is the reality. WHAT? Well if that is the case, this movie sucks. I just watched a delusion; a hypothesis. And if THAT'S the case then what's the point of it all??? Plus the acid thing made no sense either. When acid is poured on your face it leaves a scar and yet the protagonist didn't have one (though his alter ego did). *shrugs in consternation* Alrighty then. Well, anyways, the violence is good... Oh wait! That never happened! The horror elements are good..... Oh that's right! That didn't happen either! The story is revenge based which is typical but adding the element of an alter ego who is psychotic was great.... OH! THAT NEVER HAPPENED EITHER!!! So if the paradoxical conclusion was real then this movie was ruined from the beginning and (leaving me to give all of you a logical berating) only a delusional moron would find this movie brilliant.

Conclusion: 4 stars for the DVD, 1 star if the finale was real or 3 1/2 stars if the finale was not true at all but a ""what if"" scenario in which I THOUGHT it was but apparently I am wrong.",1440028800,,1517,4.492753623188406
8098255,3,B000CEV3RS,"Nothing like the definite articles to confound the Asian language as we see in the title of the film. The film is dubbed in English. Jz Murasaki was bullied as a youngster by Akai and his gang. Later in life Jz  lives in apartment 13 while Akai lives in 23. He winds up working for a construction company where Akai continues to bully him. Jz develops an alter ego which enacts revenge.

The alter ego is ""my real face"" as it is disfigured from acid. This is a film that is well done, well written, but has low action level and the plot didn't overly engage me in spite of being clever. The dialogue I found boring.  The entertainment value left a little something to be desired. The comedian on TV was cringe worthy.

The film has blood, bullying, violence and male rear nudity.  The ending was unexpected.

Note: If pouring acid on someone, you should wear gloves, apron, safety goggles and a face shield...just saying. If you get acid spilled on you, 15 minutes of flushing is recommended. HF acids spills require special treatment.",1406937600,2,1035,4.5675675675675675
8098256,4,B000CEV3RS,"This Movie made the switch from one pesonality to the next so easy to follow. It was a little off in some places, but it was still pretty good though.",1374278400,,150,4.033333333333333
8098257,4,B000CEV3RS,"This was quite a surreal head trip of a film about a guy who is bullied throughout his life, and as a result ends up creating another personality for himself as a defense mechanism. This other personality is the opposite of himself... a take no prisoners, morally inept, and cold hearted tough guy. Things get interesting as one of the protagonist's biggest bullies from his youth move in a floor above him at his apartment complex. This movie is the perfect example of why I love Asian films... stuff gets crazy and surreal pretty quick, and before you know it you'll realize this film isn't playing by the rules... it takes some real chances. I always appreciate it when a film doesn't seem confined by what it 'should' be... American films could stand to learn a lot from movies like this. I definitely recommend this one to any of you slightly more adventurous movie fans out there. 4.25/5 stars.",1294358400,,900,4.666666666666667
8098258,5,B000CEV3RS,"Ok check this..the Japanese know how to make films. This one along with Ichi the Killer(which I highly recommend)is a must have for horror fans, Hostel fans, Tarantino fans, Romero and last but not least Argento fans. If you are a real fan of any of the above-mentioned you will enjoy this movie..it is freakn awesome.",1260489600,,318,4.696428571428571
8098259,3,B000CEV3RS,"for me it was hard to follow at first. It took me some time to understand what was going on in the movie. The start and the end were confusing to me. I had bought it to see how Yumi Yoshimura was as an actress; I feel she did an excellent job in the movie. I'm a Puffy fan so I wanted to see her performance. The main theme of the movie was about bullying that was a problem in Japanese schools and revenge, etc. Some of the scenes were over the top by American standards but I tried to keep it in the Japanese prospective. I feel I would not have bothered with the movie if it wasn't for Yumi Yoshimura.",1205107200,2,604,3.959016393442623
8098260,5,B000CEV3RS,"""The Neighbor No. Thirteen"" (""Rinjin 13-go"") is a film absolutely packed with talent.  Shido Nakamura, who plays the title character of No. Thirteen, is an acclaimed Kabuki actor who made his stage debut at age nine. He made his transition to film work, and has appeared in great films such as ""Ping Pong"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"".  Yumi Yoshimura, who plays Nozomi Akai, is probably best known as one half of the pop duo ""Puffy Amiyumi"", and a cartoon character on Cartoon Network's ""Hi Hi Puffy Amiyumi"".  And if the name Takashi Miike, playing the role of the angry neighbor Kaneda, doesn't ring any bells then you need to look a little deeper into the genre of Japanese horror.

But a lot of famous names doesn't always make a great flick, especially when among them are a pop princess and an avant-garde film director, and the plot of the movie is being adapted from a comic book. In this case, however, it works.  All the pieces click together, and the result is an innovative and entertaining film.  Not bad at all for first-time director Yasuo Inoue.

The story is very topical to modern Japan, taking on the subject of school yard bullying.  More than one young child has murdered another in revenge for intolerable abuse, and even more have commited suicide rather than face another day as a constant target.  ""The Neighbor No. Thirteen"" imagines a scenario where this revenge is repressed, and allowed to fester across the years,  until it boils up to the surface taking on a life of its own.

Like most Japanese horror films, the pacing is slower and the story more subtle than a typical revenge flick.  Of course, there is blood and plenty of it, but it isn't a case of trying to kill each victim in a new and more cruel way, or an attempt to shock and disgust the audience with gore.  There is more psychology than psycho-killer.",1181088000,2,1846,4.608562691131499
8098261,4,B000CEV3RS,"""The Neighbor No. Thirteen,"" is a strange thriller that might not appeal to many tastes, however, I liked the film. The story centers on the character Murasaki Juzo (Oguri Shun). When Murasaki was a young elementary student he was constantly picked on by fellow classmates, and one in particular named Akai Juzo. In one of Akai's moments of bullying he even has his friends hold Murasaki down while he forces Murasaki to eat excrement. However, the most horrific bullying that Murasaki encounters is when Akai's friends hold him down one day while Akai pours acid onto his face.

Flashforward into the adulthood of Murasaki: and Murasaki's life has been permanently changed due to the trauma of his childhood experiences. One day, while working at his construction job, he noticies that new neighbors  have moved into his building. And thus begins a spine-chilling thriller.  At his construction job, Murasaki encounters his childhood nemesis. Akai has not matured into an adult, but is still the bully that Murasaki remembers as a young boy. When Akai locks Murasaki in the outdoor comode he is using, Murasaki crashes it open sending Akai to the ground. Only there is a change in Murasaki. Murasaki has a different appearance, and the alter-ego of Murasaki has emeged. After years of repressed and built up rage, the face the viewer sees is that of a blind and scar-faced man.

Akai continues to harass Murasaki, however, Akai does not know that Murasaki lives in the same building as he does. Akai neither knows that Murasaki knows his wife and child, nor does he know that the rage inside of Murasaki is about to explode. The viewer is unaware if what they are watching are the psychotic delusions of Murasaki, or if these are real events that Murasaki is going through. Especially how he is depicted physically. But it is the emotional trauma of Murasaki that has allowed his alter ego to finally take hold of him and now controls him. I will not spoil the film for you, however, it does have a strange twist. Especially concerning the acid spilled on his face. Recommended. Rent it first.",1166400000,3,2094,4.840782122905028
8098262,3,B000CEV3RS,"It you're a huge fan of Japanese horror movies you will probably appreciate this flick.  If not the move is a mixed bag.  There are some compelling and suspenseful scenes throughout.  The director does a good job forcing the viewer to try and figure out if they are watching something real or the main character's psychotic fantasies.  Some slow pacing here and there will probably limit the audience who will truly appreciate this film.

Of note to Puffy fan's is Yumi Yoshimura appearance as the wife of the bully.  She does a respectable job playing the role of wife and mother.

If this is your genera of movie it's worth a watch.",1163894400,3,634,4.607142857142857
8098263,2,B000CEV3RS,"The violence was okay, seemed more like a bad Anime movie. Doesnt hold a candle to Fight Club, no real similarities other than the story point listed on the box.",1145404800,,161,4.4
