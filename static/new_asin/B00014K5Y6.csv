1970513,5,B00014K5Y6,"Some called the director Henri Georges Clouzot ""the French Hitchcock."" But in many ways Hitchcock was Santa Claus next to the cynical Clouzot. The Frenchman was a master of film noir, that bleakest and blackest of film genres. He made three undeniably great films: ""Diabolique"", ""The Wages of Fear"", and this one. For some reason it's been packaged here as ""The Raven"", but its better known title is ""Le Corbeau"", or ""The Crow."" Like Clouzot's other great movies, it's a suspenseful, terrifying journey into the heart of darkness that can exist in the human soul. In a small French village, someone is sending anonymous, hate-filled letters full of lies and half-truths about the villagers: she is a thief, he is an adulterer, that doctor performs secret abortions. The letters are signed ""the Crow."" The level of hate and paranoia in the small village rises to fever pitch as a witch-hunt develops to find The Crow. The final identity of the letter-writer is shocking, but logical and inevitable. You have to watch the film twice in order to pick up all the diabolical little clues Clouzot lets drop. The protagonist, Dr. Germain (the main target of the Crow's letter-writing campaign) loses his rigidity about human nature and begins to see that people are a mixture of good and evil and that ""evil is necessary. It's like a disease from which you emerge stronger."" The film is cleverly written and beautifully and ominously photographed in the best noir style. The film was made in German-occupied France in 1943 and was a harsh portrait of a small French town, so after the war it was misconstrued by many as anti-French propaganda, and Clouzot had trouble finding work for a few years. That could be the reason why this movie is not as widely appreciated as his others. But it's not a political film that deals with passing issues.  It's a film-noir gem.",1050105600,72,1859,4.827586206896552

1943. Wartimes. And the scandal behind stages made this underrated classic,an awesome but overpowering document about the morality and the double face of many French citizens. Clouzot was accused of Nazi colaborationsit at first but when he was found not guilty, the aura that surrounded that bold and brilliant film began to become a legend, and probably the masterwork of this genial director.

I was clueless from start to finish. Genuinely unpredictable.

The depiction of a small town's pettiness is so accurate you'll think
twice before going to one :)!

An IMDb reader (W. Fickling) summed it up impeccably: ""howl of rage at
the small-mindedness and pettiness of small town bourgeois
communities"". An Amazon reviewer (Trevor Willsmer) enlightened us with
his interpretation of the Raven(s) as the Nazis, or their informers at
least, undermining the ""natural solidarity"" of French towns.

All actors are fine, Laura, Denise and her daughter included (the
obvious candidates for bad acting, because of their somewhat plain
roles).

A bleak view of human nature, like the classic ""dialogue that shows
what the director really thinks"" between the doctors about human nature
and how everybody is not very clean after all (when Dr. Germain burns
with a lamp, proving he was wrong).

The audio was a bit feeble, but it's the least you can expect from a 1943 movie.

1970531,2,B00014K5Y6,"Lots of bitter, black bile and mechanical plot thrills from the Alfred Hitchcock of France.  I guess if that's what you're looking for, this movie is for you.  Some of the exterior shots are nice and sinister, and the funeral in the middle of the film is so creepy, it might qualify this film as a Halloween rental.  But the rest of the movie feels like one of those Agatha Christie novels where we're continually made to think that one person or another is the killer, until in the end we're told it's someone we were deliberately made to believe it couldn't possibly be. Gee, thanks, Agatha.

The acting is nothing inspired, although Pierre Fresnay is always a welcome presence in any film, even if there's not much required of him here except to run around a lot.  He only got to smoke one cigarette in the whole movie!

And the guy who thinks he's Michel Simon really got on my nerves.

I know that people think this film was making some kind of statement about the paranoia among informants and informed-upon in occupied France, but I have my doubts.  In any case, for a less sensational, more mature portrayal of life in occupied France, check out Melville's ""Leon Morin, Pretre"" and ""Army of Shadows.""",1188604800,5,1208,4.586046511627907

Framed by the moral dilemma of Fresnay's Germain, a serious, stone-faced man haunted by ""two ghosts"" from the past, ""Corbeau"" adds one Hitchcockian twist after another, while immersing us in an ominous atmosphere of suspicion. Adding to the intrigue are radiant social worker Laura (Francey), elderly psychoanalyst Dr. Avorzet (the wonderful Pierre Larquey), and needy cripple Denise (Ginette Leclerc).

1970533,5,B00014K5Y6,"The story of a small French provincial town infected by the mass hysteria of suspicion, spying, and hatred caused by the damning letters revealing the guilty secrets of all citizens and always signed ""Le Corbeau"" (The Raven) is an absolutely brilliant film. It is incredibly clever, involving, and extremely dark and leaves very little hope regarding the human nature and its motivations. The word is the most dangerous and the deadliest of weapons, and a gun, a knife, or a poison only finish the evil deed that always starts with the words. The humans are very creative in choosing the right words that will hurt and infuriate the fellow human being and start the unstoppable nuclear reaction of hatred, intolerance, and violence. H.G. Cluozot had difficulties working in France after he had made ""Le Corbeau"" in 1943 which was produced by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. It took writers such as Jean Cocteau and actors such as Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, to recognize the powerful subtext to Cluozot's controversial masterpiece.",1177200000,3,1099,5.043956043956044
1970544,5,B00014K5Y6,"I concur with the other reviewers' superlatives about this remarkable film. The acting, the direction, the cinematography is all superb. Criterion has, as usual, given us a beautifully-restored print of the feature film. (Compare to the blurry quality of the original theatrical trailer, just to see how far Criterion refreshed the original). The film, even without knowing the time and place it was made, stands on its own as a look at mutual suspicion, malicious gossip and a prurient interest in personal lives -- something we can relate to, 60 years later.

Criterion has added two featurettes -- a video interview and an excerpt from a a 1975 documentary that included director M. Clouzot -- that puts Le Corbeau in its context, produced in occupied France. The material does bring out that Continental-Film, for whom Clouzot worked, was created by Joseph Goebbels with the aim of making banal, light, frothy entertainments to divert French audiences -- and instead M. Clouzot produced this, a noirish anti-informer film. All the more remarkable that this film seems fresh, and eerily current, today.

M. Clouzot would go on, post-war, to create some classic suspense films: Quai des Orfevres, Diabolique, Wages of Fear. Le Corbeau is an early example of his excellence as a director.",1153008000,2,1289,5.133333333333334

The film is in magnificent black and white, and it perfectly captures the paranoia of the war.

1970546,5,B00014K5Y6,"There is one thing that the French do better than almost any country, they produce first class cinema.  Le Corbeau (The Raven) is no exception.  Director Henri-Georges Clouzot makes a fine film from a popular novel about real poison pen strife in Tulane France during Vichy France in the early 40's.

The first thing an American would notice about the film, there are references, nay, there are actual scenes of passion and sex, clothed, but obvious between Pierre Fresnay of the pencil mustache and Ginette Leclerc of the lacquered lips in a 1943 film.  It's subdued, and the biting of the hand scene is a little pulpy, but these folks want to do it.  Americans would have to wait for Bogart and Bacall before they got some steam.

Since the Nazi's were essentially in control of France at the time, they thought an anti-informant film a bad idea.  They hated it, but the French audience's ground down by what was essentially a military defeat and then an occupation, were thrilled by the tension and mystery of Le Corbeau. There are many secrets about the townspeople that complicate life in this tense little town until the culprit has a comeuppance.  There are a number of classic original scenes like the light bulb scene or the avenging angel scene.  This one holds up very well.",1121904000,2,1285,4.726457399103139
1970547,5,B00014K5Y6,"""Beware! I see all and tell all."" So quoth the Raven, the pen name of the mysterious writer of poison pen letters that has plagued a small town in France with suspicion, fear and anxiety. Since this film was made by a Frenchman under a German controlled studio during Nazi occupied France in 1943, there is a subtext not necessarily explicit in the film itself, but nonetheless pervades its very essence. In Le Corbeau, Dr. Remy Germain becomes a victim when letters start circulating that accuse him of having an affair with a married woman and of being an abortionist.  Both of these accusations are false but do contain half-truths, and it is the unfortunate tendency for groups of people, usually motivated by fear,  to assume the worst. Furthermore, Germain is an outsider, in that he refuses to participate in gossip and avoids social clicks, which ironically makes him a target. Soon he will find himself under suspicion and alienated. Since virtually every member of the community has some skeleton in their closet, they would much rather turn their ire on the accused than risk having their own affairs aired by The Raven. And so the drama escalates to a crisis where Clouzot does not even spare the victim of blame. By assuming a position of detachment, Germain has turned a blind eye and thereby contributing to ignorance which only provides fuel for the Raven and the lies and deceit spread like a plague.",1106784000,3,1417,4.80327868852459
1970548,5,B00014K5Y6,"Le Corbeau aka The Raven is a surprisingly vivid piece of film-making, a wonderfully cinematic dissection of a town torn apart by the poison-pen letters of 'The Raven.' The initial balance of power that maintains the status quo (A knows B's indiscretion, B knows A's, so neither can destroy the other without disgracing himself) is soon destroyed as the whole town learns each other's dirty linen, with suspicions, half-truths and outright lies soon lead to the town turning on each other in the search for a scapegoat. Tragedy, suicide and murder inevitably follow...

This, of course, was the film that earned Clouzot a lasting reputation as a collaborator - made for the infamous German Continental films, it was attacked by both the Nazis for discouraging the French from informing (their main source of information during the occupation) and the resistance for attacking the French moral character. Of the two, it's pretty obvious the Nazis were on the right track. Even though the Germans are conspicuous by their absence, it makes clear that the anonymous informer/s are undermining solidarity and making the town easy prey for predators (it is implicit in the film that the Raven is not the only poison-pen writer in the town as a veritable flock of Ravens emerge).

The suspense comes not from the Raven's identity, which is blindingly obvious in this era of double-endings but must have seemed groundbreaking at the time, but from what damage the Raven will do next. Blessed with a surprisingly unlikable hero and a frankness lacking in US and British films of the period - abortion and drug-addiction are discussed as readily as adultery and embezzlement - there is a somewhat awkward Catholic moral imposed at the end (the good doctor learns it is better to let a mother die in childbirth to save the child than vice versa because the future is more important than the past) but it's still refreshingly dark. The script establishes character, setting and guilty secrets with remarkable economy and the film is blessed with a great use of location and some visually impressive set pieces: the funeral where people step around a letter left by the Raven before a child picks it up or the huge church silenced by a single letter fluttering down from the gallery are particularly striking. It also has a biting black wit and an interesting discussion about the interdependent nature of good and evil.

A genuine masterpiece, and entertaining with it, the Criterion DVD boasts exceptionally good print quality - sharp and clear - with an interesting 18-minute interview with Bertrand Tavernier on Continental and Clouzot and an interesting extract from a French documentary with Clouzot and others talking about the film and French cinema during the Nazi occupation.",1100476800,20,2773,5.037037037037037
1970549,5,B00014K5Y6,"Le Corbeau (The Raven) is an excellent French film released during World War II in 1943. In this movie, a mysterious character who is secretly sending out poison-pen letters under the title of The Raven, is, by this series of actions, creating unrest in what was once a peaceful French dwelling and, simultaneously, leading the viewer into yet another interesting exploration into the dark side of humanity. Just as the clash of egos in Lord of the Flies would spawn trouble among docile youngsters who would gradually turn from friend to foe amongst themselves, the emotion of fear, in conjunction with the circulating rumors regarding the letters of The Raven, would prevail throughout this movie and create within a serene environment a highly troubled and paranoid mindset that would, in one scene, cause an organized investigation to devolve into a witch hunt. By letting fear overrule their logic and, in consequence, frantically find scapegoats who were innocent, many an investigator were no closer to finding just who The Raven was.

Though this movie is over sixty years old, I think that within it is a creative exposition to the adage that an evil genius will control the minds of the people by finding ways to essentially keep them poor, blind, scared and stupid. Le Corbeau is based on a true account of a poison-pen incident in 1920's France; so it cannot truly be regarded as a work of fiction. It is convincing that a collective mind that is built upon rumor, superstition and hate is highly dangerous. And that is what many of the citizens in this movie so became. Perhaps that is why many find religion, which was a highly pivotal element in Le Corbeau, unappealing because of its ability to sway the emotions, if not the opinions, of several members.

Over time, I, myself, have become increasingly disturbed about the diminishing distinction between what is fact and what belongs only in the tabloids. Moreover, in the news, what is fact has taken a subordinate stature to what is public opinion, thus giving in to the truism that might makes right, even when the majority or those in power are actually in error. Le Corbeau is a small-scale, though significant, demonstration of how many can be influenced through their emotions and thus let their actions override their reflective and reasoning abilities. Furthermore, I was reminded of how potentially dangerous it can be for one to defer his or her thinking to that of others.

I give Le Corbeau five stars. It was well directed, well acted and well restored. This is a moral tale that, indeed, belongs to the priceless treasure list of the Criterion Collection.",1100217600,3,2637,4.894854586129754

8006357,4,B00014K5Y6,"Loosely based on an actual incident that occurred in 1917, LE CORBEAU (translated as THE RAVEN) concerns a small French town that is suddenly beset by anonymous letters of an especially nasty variety.  Although they attack many different people, their primary target is one of the town doctors, who is accused of everything from illicit affairs to abortionand when one of the letters drives a townsperson to suicide, all hell breaks loose.

The performances are sharp and the film moves at a rapid pace, but what really makes it interesting is a comparison to what the United States was doing in film at the time.  In many ways LE CORBEAU anticipates the gritty 1950s style of American film noir, but more significantly its material includes illicit affairs, abortion, suicide, a slightly ridiculing attitude toward the church, and a criminal that escapes justice, subjects Hollywood wouldnt be able to handle directly for another twenty years.

The film is also historically interesting, an early effort by French director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would be most famous for his later LES DIABOLIQUES.  Clouzot, who was something of a starving artist at the time, made the film in France for the German-controlled Continental Films at the height of World War II.  The Germans disliked the film, which they thought of as a swipe at French informers, but after the war French patriots attacked Clouzot for working for a German film company, and they too disliked the film, which they thought of as an attack on small-town French life.  Clouzot was barred from working in the French film industry for several years as a result.

As usual, Criterion does a beautiful job: the film elements are excellent and there are a few bonuses of genuine interest.  But ultimately the film must stand on its own, and it does so very well: dark, strange, and unwinding at a frightening tempo with strong performances, LE CORBEAU may not be among the obvious classics, but it is a classic just the same.  Recommended.

I was shocked to see a movie made in the 1940s talking about abortion. It was really chilling and I have to say I admire the filmmaker for making such a risky film.

And, remarkably enough, it was made during the World War II German occupation of France, under the Vichy regime, when all French films were supposed to be light, dreamy and uplifting.  THE RAVEN, a tight 91 minute crime drama/mystery, was anything but, controversial from its release. Some French hated it, considered it treasonous in wartime because of the bad light into which it threw the country's bourgeoisie.  But it also delivers a strong anti-informer message; so the right wing Vichy government hated it, too.  Not because a single German was shown doing anything bad; there's not a German to be seen in this film.  But because the occupying Germans got most of their information from informants.

He is carrying on some joyless sexual affairs, one with the town school master's crippled, spinster, promiscuous sister, Denise Saillens, played by Ginette Leclerc; and one with Laura Vorzet, played by Micheline Francey, the beautiful, much younger wife of one of the town's most prominent citizens, the psychiatrist Michel Vorzet (Pierre Larquay).  And  Germain will do abortions.  The film also treats drug addiction in a matter of fact way, obviously making it a target of the religious Catholic, and the right wing.  Residents of the village are unable to guess the identity of the Raven for the longest time, though current-day readers should have no trouble doing so; at one point the townsmen suspect Laura's sister, Marie Corbin, a waspish hospital nurse, played by Helena Manson.

The film boasts some remarkable, moody work with shadows throughout.  And a few knockout suspenseful scenes: one of Nurse Corbin fleeing through the town as she attempts to evade arrest.  And one of the funeral of one of the Raven's victims, a suicide: the Raven has placed a letter in one of the floral arrangements, and no villager will pick it up, until a child finally does.  And another of a letter floating down from the balcony during a mass, in which the priest has attacked the misdeeds of the townsfolk as exposed by the Raven.  Once again, no one will touch the letter for the longest time: the congregants hardly breathe.  However, I admit to some difficulty in following the film, perhaps because I was seeing something on the small screen that was meant for the large; perhaps because I am not a member of the contemporaneous French film-going audience, who might recognize the stars.  At any rate, the film gives us four old women, when only one is needed, and countless town officials in suits, so that I could not recognize many characters: Clouzot must have given every unemployed French actor work.  Mind you, I could recognize the principal four women and three men.  But in this regard, the film is nothing like the director's later works, DIABOLIQUE and WAGES OF FEAR, which have only a small number of principal characters and are easily followed.  The director must have learned from his feedback as he went along.  I also had great difficulty with the most potentially interesting of the special features, an interview with Bertrand Tavernier,(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coup-de-Torchon-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000059H7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coup de Torchon: The Criterion Collection</a>, D'ARTAGNAN'S DAUGHTER),  a fine French director.  Not only is he speaking heavily-French accented English; I also think he might have suffered a stroke prior to this interview.  He was very hard to understand, and I couldn't catch most of what he said: I wish there had been subtitles.

However, I could make out the gist of Tavernier's argument.  After the war, Clouzot was considered a German collaborator, because he made this picture for a company called Continental Films that had German, as well as French money, involved.  He was initially barred by the French government from ever making films again.  However, such outstanding French cultural figures as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir wrote in his defense, pointing out his important anti-informer message in wartime.  The suspension was eventually made for only two years, enabling Clouzot to give us his great later films.  Well, I did have some difficulty with this film, but it's worth a look as one of the director's influential early works, with his characteristic misanthropy, and wit, and a focus on the interdependency of good and evil.",1308182400,2,6070,5.979190751445087
