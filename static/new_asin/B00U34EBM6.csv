7028740,5,B00U34EBM6,"This short film touched my heart.  The story tells of a little girl, who is trying to find out if the man who teaches and preaches is the Messiah.  Rebekah's mother does not believe, she is bitter about the death of her husband.  She tries to stop Rebekah from seeing Jesus, but Rebekah needs to know for herself.  When Rebekah invites Jesus to visit her home, a miracle happens that changes the lives of the family.

Rebekah is played by Aimee Johnson, and will steal your heart as you witness her search to know for herself, who this man is.  Bruce Newbold does an amazing job portraying the Grandfather, and Melanie Stone, is wonderful as Sarah, the woman who is torn between her grief and the innocence and determination of her daughter.  Mason Davis does an excellent job in his cameo.

Darin Southam who plays Jesus, is perfectly cast, and his performance is outstanding.

The director John Lyde did an excellent job, guiding his actors to strong performances that bring this story to life.

If you believe in Jesus Christ, you must see this film, it will strengthen your beliefs and touch your heart.",1427414400,4,1107,4.65979381443299
7028741,5,B00U34EBM6,"This is a very tender, touching movie! Rebekah and her mother come upon Jesus as He is teaching. Rebekah asks 'who is that man?' Rebekah's mother, Sarah, is worrisome as she has heard many rumors. Rebekah cannot stop thinking about Him. When she finds out that her friend is going to see Jesus she asks to come along. But he leaves her behind. Rebekah seeks Jesus on her own and meets him as he is blessing the children. He calls her by name to come to him. Then she meets him next at the marketplace where she implores him to come home with her for her grandfather has told her a very heart-felt story and she wants to take Jesus to meet him. When Rebekah hears that the Savior has been killed she refuses to speak. Her grandfather knows just the cure for Rebekah...what happens next will bring tears to your eyes.

A PHENOMENAL movie!
PERFECT for the upcoming Easter Season.
Gather your family around, share this DVD, and know that He also knows Your name.",1425427200,26,958,4.443181818181818
7028742,5,B00U34EBM6,"He Knows my Name from Ron Brough - A John Lyde film Screenplay by Sally Meyer
34 Min. running time.

This is a must in preparation for the Easter Season for all Christians! Regardless of one's religious affiliation, this outstanding and touching video of ""He Knows My Name' can certainly bring comfort and hope of Life Eternal. Will we once again see our loved ones?

The setting takes place the last days of Jesus' life on earth. The story depicts an important part of the main mission of the Savior, Jesus Christ's.

The Child Rebecca, played by Aimee Johnson, is a curious, strong-willed girl's who happens on a hill where Jesus was teaching. Her spirit was drawn to Him to her mother's dismay. The story portrays child's interactions with her mother, grandfather, and neighbor boy. The thought that came to my mind throughout the movie was ....""and a child shall lead them..."".

The acting cast were very intense and convincing for the most part. Aimee captured the heart of the audience! The appeal of Darin Southam as Jesus was very powerful.  Mason D. Davis did a remarkable job in his brief appearance as a younger Ruben!

The musical score truly enhanced the scenes and emotions of the story. One truly felt as though he/she was there experiencing each occasion!

The boy, Isaac portrayed by Koleman Stinger; Bruce Newbold portrayed the grandfather; Melody Stone portrayed the mother; and the quivk ""stand ins"" all did remarkably well in ""living"" their parts. One criticism is one of the emotional scenes wasn't convincing. However, my biggest criticism is each scene was cut too short! I would love for it to be a longer movie.
I am grateful to Stephanie at Covenant Communications, Inc. for allowing me to be among the first to review this amazing new DVD video!

*This DVD was sent to me in exchange for an HONEST review, of which I have given.",1425340800,13,1856,4.7601246105919

7028765,5,B00U34EBM6,"This is the companion ""short"" to ""No Ordinary Shepherd"". These productions were perhaps meant to be quaint stories for a younger Sunday School audience to gently tell of Jesus.
However, something happened along the way to making this second film. I do not know if the writers intended it, or if the Holy Spirit guided it, but this story gained remarkable depth and symbolism. It became a very wonderful look at Jesus among the people.

The story follows the curiosity, then yearning of a little Jewish girl to see and then be near Jesus. It clearly emphasizes that we must come to Him like little children. But it also delves subtly into the theological aspects of those who have died before he came, those who doubt (particularly in their own sadness and struggles), and those who struggle to go to Him but wish to.
While certainly a perfect movie for 3rd grade up, we were so touched while watching it in our living room we did not want to speak for a while afterwards while we reflected on who Jesus was when He came to us in the flesh.

We rated it at 5 tissues, or rather 5 stars.",1454112000,9,1085,4.447236180904523
