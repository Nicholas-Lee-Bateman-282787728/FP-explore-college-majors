8399714,3,B003LKK9W0,"This dual disc DVD set captures the early Genesis, the Genesis of the Seventies in both black and color. Disc 1 contains footage of three classic albums, From Genesis to Revelation (1970), Trespass (1971), and Nursery Cryme (1972). Disc 2 covers in chronological order Foxtrot (1973), Selling England by The Pound (1974), and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1975). The accompanying commentary does disrupt the flow of the music, but the status of dramatic art which the music of early Genesis aspired to achieve within the context of its front-man Peter Gabriel's musical quirks is evident. Very much at the heart of this project's agenda is to let contemporary audiences have rare glimpses of the Peter Gabriel-led Genesis. The illustrative footage nicely situates the provocative historical and evaluative commentary, capturing the theatricality and unique talent of the Gabriel-led Genesis.",1399420800,5,893,5.385714285714286

8399716,4,B003LKK9W0,"Few videos from genesis, the problem is that they do not contain full songs, they are cut by comments , but for a fan it is good to have it",1356480000,5,139,3.6666666666666665
8399717,1,B003LKK9W0,I thought this would be straight up good footage of their old concerts. Instead you just have these opinionated prog geeks interrupt constantly. (Good footage though if it was left on it's own) Real sad.,1355875200,12,203,4.828571428571428
