We also pay serious attention to how Pastor John MacAurthur uses direct examples with in the Bible to prove we are not to be a  cold or even luke-warm child of Christ  but we are to be on fire for Him by taking a stronger position in following all of God's words and using the utmost dedication to not add to or take from what is written and the meaning there of in the Bible...too many people are and have been becoming sluggish in the church by choosing what Bible teachings they feel is/isn't appropriate and thus becoming more and more lazy due to fear of what others will think or say.
  There is SO MUCH more in these teachings and we hope and pray you will give them a chance by watching the 5 part series and see if you can find anywhere in his teachings where he manipulated what the Bible teaches. so far we can't disprove anything and we have even gone to the numerous verses which he presents to back up his teachings, where by we read the verses well before and well after the verses he gave in order to see if he was taking the meaning out of context, but even after doing this we could clearly see what he was teaching was the sincere meaning of God's word.",1407542400,2,1524,4.22680412371134
