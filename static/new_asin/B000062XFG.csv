1685312,1,B000062XFG,"Season Two of Star Trek: The Next Generation is in my opinion, the worst of what is ultimately one of my favorite television programs.  First of all, there was a writer's strike at the beginning of the season, and a great deal of the episodes had thrown together scripts from the never-realised Star Trek II Series.  Apparently the staff behind the scenes was in turrmoil as well, and this reflected on screen.  The most important reason why I hate season two is because of what is known as the
""Great Doctor Experiment"" or something like that.  As a young girl when the series began, I found Gates McFadden's portrayel of Dr. Crusher to be inspiring.  I didn't feel that way about the other female characters at the time.  Tasha Yar was far too butch, and it took a couple of seasons for the character of Troi to develop into a useful character.  To replace likable Dr. Beverly Crusher with that crusty old Pulaski was a terrible mistake.  She ruined the show, and I refuse(d) to watch any episode with her in it.  Thankfully the powers that be came to their senses for season three, which I consider one of the best seasons of ST:TNG.  For me, the show really became entertaining and just good from season three on.  The second season finale was a Star Trek rarity of flashbacks, and it ended what was a pathetic season.",1020902400,8,1322,4.5358649789029535
1685313,3,B000062XFG,"Season Two of Star Trek: The Next Generation shows glimpses of greatness but It's not until Season Three that TNG really caught its stride. The Borg are Introduced in Q Who, one of Season two's finest episodes . The Measure of a Man is also a great episode foreshadowing much of the Character development Data would undergo throughout the Series.  The Emissary would help flesh out Worfs background and give us some much needed insight into what made him tick. Jonathen Frankes was given a greater amount of leeway in his portayel of Riker. Which brought about a more colorful and humorous character instead of the stoic Riker of Season One. Riker also greaw a beard which also helped add warmth to the Character. Of the More notable additions Whoopie Joined the Cast as the memorable Guinan. The shows sets started to evolve as the budjet grew which resulted in a less sterile look.
I found this Box set to be good but not great. The Box set contains more extras than season one but thats not saying much. I enjoyed seeing the props and going through Star Trek's vault but what you see is all to brief. The Other Features suffer the same fate. They take what could easily be an hour feature and split it up into tiny pieces so that they can give you the Illusuion that your getting a lot more than wahts really there. The Features I would like to have seen include commentary tracks, deleted scenes, bloopers and Episode preveiws. I guess beggers cant be choosers but I hope that Paramount does a better job with the later season box sets in the Features department. As For the visual and audio quality of the disks, not bad. The Audio has been remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound ( applause here. ) All in all a good set but with definite room for Improvement.",1020729600,7,1759,4.531446540880503

1685315,5,B000062XFG,"This release of Star Trek The Next Generation on DVD contains all of the episodes of its second season. During the second season we see Dr. Crusher replaced with Dr. Pulaski and we are introduced to the Borg<...All 22 episodes are contained on 6 disks.

1685316,4,B000062XFG,"Many people don't like Season 2 because it changed Doctor characters and it had its fill of ""bottle shows"", however there's still some really good episodes in Season 2.
For example, ""Where Silence Has Lease"" is a good one where the Enterprise gets hurled into a void when they're confronted by an alien in the void that puts the crew through a deadly experiment.
Another good episode is ""Elementary Dear Data"" where Data is involved in a Sherlock Holmes holodeck adventure and we see the debut of the Moriarty villian.
""Loud as a Whisper"" isn't bad either when a deaf mediator tries to bring peace to a war-torn planet, but his interpreters are all killed in a ambush. Cool on-planet episode with aliens.
""A Matter of Honor"" is probably one of the best episodes of Season 2 when Riker takes part in kind of an exchange program on a Klingon BoP and then is forced to attack the Enterprise to prove his honor.
""The Message of a Man"" is an interesting courtroom drama where they have to prove that Data is a valuable asset to the crew instead of just a machine.
""Contagion"" isn't all that bad either when a probe makes the Enterprise defenseless against a Romulan Warbird.
""Time Squared"" is a memorable episode where Piccard's duplicate from the near future is in the present warning the Enterprise of its impending destruction against a blackhole-like anonomoly.
""The Icarus Factor"" is a good one where Worf is challenged by the Klingon council and Riker's father shows up with some age ol' grudges.
""Q Who?"" is another one of the classic episodes in which Q sends the Enterprise into the far reaches of space to make first contact with the Borg.
""The Emissary"" was one of my old favorites when Worf meets his sole mate, a fiesty Klingon female who has an attitude. I'm alway impartial to the Klingon-heavy episodes.
""Peak Performance"" is also one of the great episodes where Riker takes over an Constellation-class ship to battle the Enterprise in a wargame when the game is rudely interrupted by a Ferengi Marauder.
So in reality half of the episodes are pretty good. The other half are either filler or bottle shows that either may or may not be good. Some have to do with mysterious illnesses, holodeck problems, or Lwaxana Troi garbage. The pluses are that we finally get Guinnan and Ten-Forward in the series. Something sorely missing from the first season.",1017792000,29,2361,4.733009708737864
1685317,4,B000062XFG,"The Second Season of Next Gen. is by no means flawless. A writters strike that year did not help matters either. there are however some excellent episodes in this season, particularly Measure of a Man which alone makes this collection worthwhile. This season also has the other doctor while Crusher was away. They were going for a Bones and Spock relationship with her and Data. At times it works and it makes this an intresting, different season from the rest. The charecters begin to gel this season better as well. Picard starts to become the Picard we love, not that akward brit faking a bad french accent. Still, if you are just a causual fan save your money for season three on first before you invest in this. [It's] a lot to spend for a season with ups and downs. It is however much better than the first.",1015200000,11,813,4.5
1685318,5,B000062XFG,"Season 2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation improves on the first series by introducing occasionally stronger character based shows and situations. While Tasha Yar is missed, and to a lesser extent Doctor Crusher, we're introduced to 2 new characters. Dr. Pulaski and Guinan. Personally I always enjoyed Pulaski shows, she was one of the only characters that brought a bit of conflict into the programme. There was never enough coming and going of new blood into the Star Trek series (either in front or behind the camera). Guinan (and the new location for her ""Ten Forward"" - a great setting for comedy/social moments) added more life and mystery into the show. It was a shame she wasn't able to appear in more episodes in the later parts of the series (she does have a cameo role in Star Trek Nemesis).
The episodes themselves were extremely varied. Due to the writer's strike, the season was cut short to 22 episodes rather than the full 26 ending with the appalling ""bottle show"", 'Shades of Grey' (Plot summary: Riker in a coma and Deanna ""looking worried"" while Pulaski puts copious L.E.Ds on his forehead). ""The Royale"" was also truly terrible. There were some storming episodes though, the best being ""Q Who."" This episode had everything: Q, the introduction of the Borg, Guinan, great special effects and a superb score by Ron Jones. Other great episodes were ""Contagion"" and ""Time Squared""
This box set has everything you could wish for (that's why I'm giving it 5 stars): remastered picture and Dolby Digital sound, one hour of new interviews and documentaries, and some really awesome DVD menus. Although seasons 1 and 2 aren't the best you can't really miss these, they are great foundation episodes with the DVD box sets given the care and attention they deserve.

1685326,3,B000062XFG,"Although the series starts to find its stride here in season two, there are still some remarkably mediocre episodes to this season, some so overpoweringly bad that they undo the value of the handful of very entertaining ones. The season starts with a very weak intro (""The child"") with the alien that impregnates Troy (and with Worf's militant insistence on abortion? I understand the show trying to stay topical and all, but seriously?)  ""Manhunt"" is hands-down the single worst Trek episode I can think, if not the worst episode of any series I've ever seen (and that includes the James Brown peanut butter-themed alien episode of 'Miami Vice') with the plot little more than Lwaxana Troi feeling especially frisky and stalking Picard while he instead decides to hide out in the holodeck to do basically nothing but hide. This is some of the worst of Trek and was a chore to watch.  There were a few highlights such as ""The Royale"", which was goofy and implausible, yet for this reason and others it remains an episode more consistent with the feel of the original series.  ""A Matter of Honor"" was a creative look at Riker serving on a Klingon ship, and ""Q-Who"" arguably the highlight of the second season as the Borg are introduced. Feels like the series is still finding it's way and there are a few gems this season, but for the most part the writing and stories are lackluster (including the season finale with the Riker ""flashbacks"". Two seasons in and they do this gimmick already?)",1486339200,,1490,4.745173745173745

1685348,5,B000062XFG,"Full disclosure, I grew up watching the show as a kid so I have a fair amount of nostalgia for the serious. That being said, the show still lives up what I remember it and my wife, who i have recently introduced Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 to has also loved watching the episodes. The writing and acting are generally great and each episode is a lot of fun to watch.  My two favorites from this season are 'A Matter of Honor"" which takes Riker (thank god he grew the beard) to a klingon vessal as an exchange officer and ""Measure of a Man"" which discusses whether Data is a life form or property of the federation.

Do yourself a favor and skip the last episode (""Shades of Grey"").  It is almost entirely a flash back episode and does nothing to drive the plot or the characters' development forward.  the writing is also terrible and the solution to the main problem of the episode is scientifically stupid and I am amazed that the actress playing Dr. Pulaski (a replacement for Dr. Crusher) can keep a straight face.  However, I would not judge the season by that episode as it is generally considered one of the worst ever for Next Generation and was caused by the writers strike at the time.",1483920000,,1214,4.401785714285714

However, one flaw was that they took Dr. Crusher away.  That was a mistake, as she was an important element in the show.  I am glad they brought her back in season 3.  I thought the show reached full maturity in season 3. From that season forward it went on to be a very top notch show.  Seasons 3 to 7 get five stars.

1685659,3,B000062XFG,"The first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was a complete mess. So the next season had to be much better, right?

Well, yes and no. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 2"" was a definite improvement, especially since it lost much of the stifling smugness of the debut season... but it still wasn't terribly good, especially since it disposed with the likable Dr. Crusher in favor of the prickly sneering Dr. Pulaski. It has some truly classic, beautifully-written episodes (""Q Who,"" ""Elementary Dear Data""), but it also suffers from some staggeringly awful ones (""Up The Long Ladder,"" ""The Outrageous Okona"").

Since Dr. Crusher has vanished without a trace (don't worry, she comes back), the Enterprise welcomes a new doctor, Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur), who turns out to be obnoxious, condescending, demanding and picks on Data (Brent Spiner) for fun. She also arrives just in time for Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) to inexplicably become pregnant, after being essentially raped by a ball of energy. Much drama ensues.

Among the other adventures the crew has: Geordi (Levar Burton) accidentally creates a self-aware hologram; a deaf ambassador is left helpless when his assistants are killed; a dying scientist wants Data to help him achieve immortality; an aging virus threatens Pulaski's life; a destructive computer virus runs rampant through the ship; Data befriends a young child from a self-destructing world; a future version of Picard is found adrift, having survived the Enterprise's destruction; and Riker gets jabbed by a toxic thorn that triggers a clip show.

There are some staggeringly awful episodes in this season, such as ""The Outrageous Okona"" (""If you put funny teeth in your mouth, and jump around like an idiot... that is considered funny"") or ""Up The Long Ladder"" (a ham-handed and irrational sermon on abortion, rife with grotesque Irish stereotypes). The show hadn't yet fully shaken off that first-season ridiculousness and preachiness, even though the quality of the overall season is substantially better.

... and yet, it also contains some staggeringly excellent classics, such as ""The Measure of a Man"" (in which Data must fight for his rights as an individual, rather than a piece of property) and ""Q Who"" (Q throws the Enterprise across the galaxy, warning them of a terrifying alien threat that is coming for them).

In other words, the second season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" tended to seesaw wildly in quality, swinging between the sublime and the ridiculous. One thing was certainly improved -- there was greater depth and intelligence in these stories, and an increased awareness that moral and ethical issues do not (and should not) have an easy answer. Even the trickster Q reveals that he has more dimension and depth. Yes, there are some lapses (Riker killing his clones in ""Up The Long Ladder""), but most of the time we have deeper examinations of the Prime Directive, the nature of artificial life, and so on.

Most of the other episodes are... okay. Neither brilliant nor staggeringly bad, they have the Enterprise crew embarking on some solid one-off episodes that puts them up against Klingon sleepers, a computer virus, diplomatic problems, and so on.

It also succeeds in making the characters much more likable -- Picard has softened considerably into a more paternal figure, Riker's youth is explored somewhat, and we see more of what shaped Worf into the Klingon he is today. But the greatest development is to Data -- he continues to branch out with the eagerness of a child, from the idea of having a ""grandfather"" to his continuing interest in Sherlock Holmes. And of course, he ceases to be just the token android, and instead must present himself as a sentient individual with rights.

And of course, there is Pulaski. I can only assume that the writers thought she would be like Leonard McCoy from the original series, with her prickliness, irreverence and aversion to transporters. But her traits are so exaggerated that she just seems condescending and demanding, without any warmth or redeeming characteristics. And her almost-obsessive picking on Data is like watching someone repeatedly kicking a child.

""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 2"" is a vast improvement on the first season, but it was not yet the brilliant show it would later become. It's certainly worth watching, but some of the episodes should definitely be skipped.",1454716800,2,4426,5.084022038567493

1685895,3,B000062XFG,"Season 2 of Star Trek The Next Generation was plauged with many many problems. One of the which was the 1988 writers strike which caused many of the episodes to be rehashed from old Star Trek phase II scripts. Nevertheless some important things happened for the first time this season: 10 forward, Guinan, Geordi in engineering, a less severe look for Deanna Troi, a new doctor for one season,and it almost goes without saying, Commander Riker's beard. The episode season highlights highlights are the measure of a man, q Who, a matter of honor and the emissary.

 The Blu ray dics have previously been noted to have been digitally reconstructed from another company other than CBS digital. To the casual observer, I don't believe that the differences are that noticeable unless you know what you're looking for. Overall the series is much sharper and the colors are more vivid then any previous VHS or DVD release.
It's nice that measure of a man has an audio commentary but most of the interesting tidbits are already mentioned in the documentaries elsewhere in the set.  Netflix just posted the entire series in HD to stream, but if you need to see the special features buy this, used perhaps.",1441843200,,1196,4.796116504854369

1685946,4,B000062XFG,Not the best season of The Next Generstion but still decent Star Trek. We get to see the change over from Dr. Crusher to Diana Muldars Dr. Pulaski who I think would have developed into a very interesting charector had she stayed on.

1685990,5,B000062XFG,I'm a trekkie so my opinion may differ I'd you're not. Although the original series was great this 2nd generation series is better filmed and scripted. Makeup artistry is also heads and tails better than the original making the characters much more believable. My wife hated star trek but that's because she never really watched it or knew the characters now that she has.

The sound and the clarity of the video is excellent on my iPad and I can watch one episode or as many as I want.  I have read the reviews of some others that have reviewed this second season and I tend to agree.  It is too bad that a writing strike or some such thing limited the number of episodes during the second season and while I have liked some episodes better than others, what I am surprised about is that there is some pretty profound philosophy that comes out from some of the characters in some of the episodes.  On the other hand, I find some episodes a bit ridiculous and far-fetched like the Holideck (not sure I spelled this right) detective episodes. You have to take the good with the bad but overall its a bit of fun.",1434412800,,893,4.229411764705882

The story lines are generally good, tackling some social issues ala TOS. Some episodes are just fun, and the introduction of the holodeck brings a new option to the writers. Yes, Wesley is annoying, Troi states the obvious, and Worf always wants to kill something. Polaski is the future Dr. McCoy in every aspect except one; you didn't' hate McCoy. Yes, they make up a lot stuff that isn't real. IT'S A TV SHOW!. I hate to burst your bubble but NONE of it is real. That's the idea.",1433721600,,587,4.288288288288288

1686046,5,B000062XFG,"Season 2 of Star Trek The Next Generation looks great on the FirstStick.

It's the 'cleaned up' version of The Next Generation that enhances (not changes) many of the special effects. The overall print of the video is cleaned up as well to make it look really crisp on an HD television in a digital format. It's like watching the series for the first time. If you haven't watch Trek since the 90's, give it another go. It's still presented in full frame (black bars on the side of the picture) but it looks brand new.

As for the show itself, Season 2 made a lot of progress over season 1. The cast and writers know who they are at this point and were delivering episodes with more confidence. The series doesn't really hit its full stride yet by season 2, but it's definitely on it's way. (Season 3 is when TNG really takes off)

The biggest change for Season 2 is that Riker's beard makes its first appearance!",1429660800,,912,4.384615384615385

1686117,4,B000062XFG,"This is a classic '80's show that was trying to depict a future that can still only be imagined.  It's campy, fairly predictable, and I LOVE IT.  It only got four starts because the stories are not as rich early in its run as the series gets later. The show deals with some very human dilemmas that are certainly relevant to real life such as human rights and equality, learning from failures, accepting ones self, etc.... My family enjoys watching it together and only occasionally do we have to skip scenes or have the children leave the room for overt sexual content.  Apparently, the 24th century is very open about their sexuality and while that is fine, it is not entirely appropriate for my 8-year-old!
The cast photo is misleading. The character Dr. Beverly Crusher is not in this season of the show, yet for reasons likely contractual at the time, she is credited throughout. This season features the character Dr. Polaski who is fine, but lacks some of the character connections and story that go with Dr. Crusher.",1424390400,,1024,4.709497206703911

1686119,5,B000062XFG,"Season 2 of TNG definitely has an edge over Season 1 if only because the characters are fairly well fleshed out.  Warf (Michael Dorn) moves both his forehead and up to replace the missing Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and little Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaten) has more to say.  (I still think Wesley was Picard's love child.)

Since Star Trek was all about exploration, the sky was the limit.  Unlike the original series where more often than not, ""We come in peace"" really means ""We'll she'd you to pieces,"" TNG did offer more diplomatic solutions than not courtesy of ThunderThigh's (Marina Sirtis) ability to read emotions in living beings.

TNG offered the galaxy hope.  Gene Roddenberry's creation lives on in digital form.",1423958400,,722,4.925619834710743

1686122,5,B000062XFG,"While I won't repeat at length my earlier comments Ive posted on Season One of STTNG, I will say once again that the remastering process by which the show was transformed is nothing short of spectacular. Gone is the 80s brown that seemed to permeate much of the shows original television release, and the rescanning of the 35mm original negatives have released the series so that it can be seen in a way never before possible. Colors pop. Resolution is superb. Noise (with a few notable exceptions on just a few scenes in a few episodes) is nearly non-existent. Detail is so high that we see the seams of uniforms that could never before be noticed, the little details of control panels, badges, and every aspect of the sets themselves (but they never really could get the rocks on those darned planets to look real: the increased resolution does nothing in that respect to add to realism, and, actually may contribute to the fakeness of these planet scenes). The audio is excellent, and even though the major gains are witnessed via the visual aspects of the show, the remastering process has brought the best out of the original audio tracks to make them clearer than ever before. What CBS has achieved here is nothing short of amazing, and there are few, if any, that would disagree with that.

Like any show which people feel strongly about, STTNG supports a minefield of opinions about which I won't try to engage. Personally, I thought the show got off to a much better than expected start in Season One, particularly when one considers just how high the stakes were for the remaking of a cult classic. But perhaps thats part of the reason, because STTNG is, in many respects, NOT a remake at all, but a show which merely shares some DNA from the original show, but boldly goes in its own direction. And with the stakes so high, I feel Season One actually did very well, meeting most expectations, and exceeding quit a number of them, with that first season holding some real gems.

But it is in Season Two where things really get going. The show now understands itself more than before. The actors have come to grips with the unachievable expectations placed on them at the beginning (and the directors, producers, and writers, as well). The show begins to hit its stride, and now can enjoy itself for what it is, its OWN show. Little details start to shake out in increasingly smooth ways. Characters begin to coalesce. Story lines that support and span multiple episodes begin to appear. And the number of good or excellent episodes increases from the first season. And while a number of people feel that it is in Season Three that the show really achieves what it needed to do, I think a strong case can be made that this has already occurred, to a greater or lesser extent, in Season Two.

Some of the special effects have been redone to match the high resolution video rescans in this release, but they are essentially seamless, and often look extraordinarily gorgeous.

Along with the remastering of the original series, this remastering of STTNG must surely rank as one of most incredible achievements in TV history. It was really worth every penny, but the good news is that, by early 2015, the cost of these early seasons continues to fall, and they can be picked up at very reasonable prices. They were outrageously priced at the beginning, but even then, people purchased and enjoyed them because of the true breakthrough quality these rescans achieved. Now, with the prices fallen for both shows to levels that are often astounding (the entire Star Trek TOS series, all three years, has been available in Blu-Ray at times for $69), they are simply bargains. But once you start watching, you won't be thinking of that: youll be thinking of just how amazing it is to see the show like youve never seen it before. Five stars.",1423612800,2,3841,4.685925925925926

1686186,5,B000062XFG,"I am enjoying going back through the Next Generation seasons, as I was never a consistent viewer when they were originally broadcast.  It is especially interesting to see the early development of races such as the Ferengi and the ""new"" Klingons.  The individual episodes are mostly self contained, typically following a mystery-analysis-challenge-resolution plot arc.  The first season seemed to re-use many formulas from the original Star Trek, especially the cheap looking planetary sets.  But this second season is starting to cut some dramatic teeth with the new characters, especially Data and his quest to become more human.

The Amazon video quality is consistently much higher than Netflix.  One recurring disappointment with the Amazon stream, though, is that the audio keeps dropping.  Every episode it seems the audio will just stop at some point.  The situation is fixed by backing up the stream 5 or 10 seconds and reloading, but it is annoying.  These Next Generation videos on Amazon are the only ones for which I've experienced this difficulty.

Update:  I recently determined that the problem with audio dropping is not the fault of the stream, but of my DAC:

Orei DA34X Premium Digital to Analog Audio Decoder SPDIF/Coaxial 5.1-Channel Input to RCA L/R/3.5mm Headphone Output

I confirmed that the audio of the stream is not interrupt when not routed through the DAC.  The DAC does not have an ""on/off"" switch and had been left on 24/7 for months.  Other users' comments on the DAC suggest that its service life is limited to a few months.",1416528000,,1558,5.0549019607843135

1686210,4,B000062XFG,"I happen to like the 2nd season best of all the ST:TNG, and since BCCA avoids airing these episodes, I bought the BR.  I bought these used for around $44 I think if I remember right and AFAICT, the packaging looked NEW.  I have watched all of the episodes and there are many excellent added bonus features.  As to the quality, some of it at first seemed a bit overdone, some of the colors seemed really SATURATED to the extreme, especially space scenes but also in uniforms.  My only other significant observation was some considerable variation in picture quality.  It seemed to (strangely enough) be mainly isolated to BRIDGE SCENES and in the first few episodes of the season, where several times in certain scenes, there was a dramatic increase in the GRAIN of the image, like it was highly over-processed and over-sharpened.  The rest of the time, the picture quality was good, very good, or occasionally SUPERB, especially in many of the space scenes.  I am an electronic engineer and tend to be pretty critical as a videophile, but overall, especially for my price, I am not dissatisfied.  Overall, the quality was adequate to good, and the few scenes with the noted grain were not that long or of much bother to me.  You learn to look past them.  What made them stand out so was the sudden change in quality from the scenes prior to and after!  Not really sure WHY these particular scenes were like this;  there must be a reason as I don't see how the production staff could have missed it, and obviously, the other 96% of the scenes DID NOT have to be that way.  Oh well, at least now I have the episodes and it sure beats how they looked when originally aired in 1989!  But just know that the overall quality is NOT up to the high standards of the remade ST:TOS.  But then, for some inexplicable reason, TNG was shot using video tape.",1413590400,,1844,4.5120481927710845

She was greatly under-used in Season One and I can understand why she left the show... but the final episodes of Season One, which gave her an expanded role and more significant screen time revealed a hint of what she could do when given the chance.  I also miss Doctor Crusher... But the addition of Whoopie Goldberg as the bartender and part-time counselor was a stroke of genius.

Episode Synopses Follow:

1. The Child  The Enterprise is en route to assist in dealing with a plague but, since this is Star Trek, it cannot be a routine voyage. Counselor Troi unexpectedly finds herself impregnated by an unknown life form. While it typically takes her species 10 months to bear young, this eager trooper looks set to be born in 36 hours. After birth, he begins to grow rapidly. He is not a troublesome child but he does pose a great danger to everybody aboard.
2. Where Silence has Lease  The Enterprise is sent to chart an area that has had no human contact and they encounter a strange void in space. The Federation has no record of anything like it but the Klingons have a legend and its not good. When the Enterprise is enveloped by the void, escape becomes problematical and the ghost ships don't help much either. After that, things get bad.
3. Elementary Dear Data  -  The Enterprise is waiting for a rendezvous with another ship and the crew has some time to kill while waiting so Data and La Forge make a trip to the holodeck to play Sherlock Holmes. Dr. Pulaski does not believe that Data can solve a true, original mystery so the computer is directed to create a new one with an adversary capable of defeating him. The version of Prof. Moriarity created by the computer is a worthy adversary indeed and poses a threat to the ship itself. By the way, Worf shooting his cuffs in a Victorian morning coat is just precious.
4. The Outrageous Okona  The Enterprise stops to help out a tramp freighter captain with a part problem. The guy turns out to be a rake, cad, rascal, lothario, etc. The crew is amused by him and Data wants to learn to understand humor and why some things are funny. He enlists the aid of a historic comedian on the holodeck in an attempt to learn. Meanwhile the Enterprise is stopped by another ship that demands the surrender of the notorious criminal rescued at the beginning of the episode. When another ship from a different planet shows up making the same demand, things get more interesting. The rascals presence is demanded on the bridge for an explanation but it proves to be problematical to track him down. After all, the Enterprise has a large complement of female crew members! Its a story of a likeable rogue, outraged fathers and a frustrated starship captain. Its also good for a few laughs.
5. Loud as a Whisper  The Enterprise is tasked to transport a diplomat charged with arranging a peace between two warring planets. The diplomat is a bit strange. He is a deaf mute and relies upon a chorus of empaths to speak for him. He is arrogant and brilliant. He also has the hots for Counselor Troi. When one of the peace delegates turns out to be a traitor, it is up to the Enterprise crew to fill the void and aid the diplomat and, in doing so, improve him.
6. The Schizoid Man  The Enterprise is hurrying off in response to a distress call concerning the Federations foremost scientist. He is a recluse and a curmudgeon. His only companion has noticed some strangeness. He has a terminal disease and a plan to cheat death that will also cheat one of the crew of his life.
7. Unnatural Selection  The Enterprise receives a distress call from another Federation ship. When they arrive, all are dead of natural causes and old age. When checking along the ships route, they find their previous stop, a research station, afflicted with premature geriatric onset as well. The only ones not affected are the genetically modified children. They station demands that the kids be saved. Doing so can put everyone at risk.
8. A Matter of Honor  The Enterprise is selected to take part in an exchange program in which officers from other places are temporarily placed on the Enterprise. The exchange works both ways and Cmdr. Ryker becomes the first Federation officer to ever be assigned to a Klingon ship. While Ryker battles his way to respect on the Klingon ship and a visiting ensign brown-noses his way to contempt upon the Enterprise, a strange new life form threatens both ships.
9. The Measure of a Man  The Enterprise pays a visit to a new starbase and the Captain encounters an old flame the old flame who prosecuted the Captain for the loss of the Stargazer. More fireworks are in store, though. Data is ordered by Starfleet to allow himself to be disassembled by a scientist in order that his construction may be better understood. Data and the rest of the Enterprise crew object and that leads to a legal confrontation which forces members of the crew to work against each other. This is a truly engaging episode!
10. The Dauphin  The Enterprise is sent to transport a young head of state with an overprotective escort. The Dauphin is young, intelligent and beautiful. Wesley Crusher would say that I understate the description. That leads to tensions with the escort and has political ramifications that only become more complex since she is not what she appears.
11. Contagion  The Enterprise responds to a distress call from another Galaxy class starship. It is having major system malfunctions. Worse, this is happening in the neutral zone. The captain of that ship had been investigating some legends. The Enterprise is ready to help but her sister ship blows up. While trying to solve the mystery of the ships destruction, the Enterprise heads deeper into the Neutral Zone risking war with the Romulans. And then the Enterprise starts having system malfunctions.
12. The Royale  The Enterprise is investigating some wreckage around an inhospitable planet. The wreckage seems to date back to the NASA era. Stranger, there is some sort of structure in a safe zone on the otherwise uninhabitable planet. When the away team investigates, they find a hotel and casino. This episode seems familiar in a vague sort of way. I know I have never seen it before but it seems like I have. I think it is a knock-off of another episode from some series.
13. Time Squared  The Enterprise encounters a Federation shuttle in trouble and rushes to the rescue. When it is brought aboard, its hull numbers match those of the Enterprises own shuttle. When it is opened, its single passenger is unconscious and familiar: Capt. Picard.  He and the shuttle are from the near future and it seems the Enterprise is doomed.
14. The Icarus Factor  Cmdr Ryker is offered a command of his own. As he makes his decision as whether to accept it or not, he receives a briefing on the status of the ship he would get. The briefing is delivered by his estranged father. Meanwhile, something is wrong with Worf. He is not acting normally. Hes somewhat touchy, even by Klingon standards.
15. Pen Pals  The Enterprise is tasked to investigate a series of planets with strange geology. Everything in these systems seems to occur at an accelerated rate. Wesley Crusher is tasked with leading the investigating team, his first command responsibility. As the survey progresses, Data gets into contact with a child on one of the planets. The geological situation is such that she is in grave danger but that pesky Prime Directive would seem to preclude any interference.
16. Q Who? -  The Captain suffers a spill on his uniform and heads to his quarters to change. He steps out of the turbo lift and onto a shuttle craft nowhere near the Enterprise crewed by Q. Q has a request. Hes in trouble with the rest of the Q Continuum and seeks asylum on the Enterprise. He want to enlist! When Qs offer is refused we realize that he does not deal well with rejection. He sends the Enterprise hurtling off into a new area to meet some new playmates called the Borg. Its going to be a long day for Picard and his crew.
17. Samaritan Snare  The Enterprise is heading to do a survey of some pulsars but the captain has been ordered to report to a starbase for some medical treatment. He leaves against his will in the company of Wesley Crusher who is ordered to report for Starfleet examinations. No sooner does the shuttle leave than the Enterprise gets a distress call. The ship sending out the call is crewed by a race of morons; all are surprised that they have made it as far as they have. The problem is, they are looking for something besides a repair and the repairman is in danger.
18. Up the Long Ladder  The Enterprise is sent to investigate an SOS that seems to date from the 22nd century. They find a world in danger from solar flares whose human colonists had mostly eschewed technology. In effect, the Enterprise takes on a bunch of pseudo-18th century Irish refugees along with their livestock. The groups leader has a daughter he is trying to unload who could give Maureen OHara in her most shrewish role a good run for her money!  In the words of Capt. Picard, Sometimes you just have to bow to the absurd! Just as you think you have settled into a comic relief episode, one of the evacuated colonists asks about the other colony and things take a more serious and nefarious turn. This is another episode that seems to have taken its plot from elsewhere. I think, in this case, it was the original Battlestar Galactica.
19. Manhunt  The Enterprise is dispatched to transport some non-Federation diplomats to a conference. At the last minute, a Betazoid diplomat is sent for transport as well. The Betazoid Ambassador is Counselor Trois mother with all of the discomfort and chaos that entails. She has some matchmaking planned and its making the captain very uncomfortable. I suspect that everyone else in the crew finds it hilarious except, perhaps, the mortified daughter.
20. The Emissary  The Enterprise gets mysterious orders to intercept a probe with a passenger aboard. They are then to assist the passenger in every way. The passenger turns out to be a Klingon and she is tasked with making contact with some Kilingons found in stasis. This is a touchy situation because when those Klingons went into stasis, they were the deadly enemies of the Federation. Matters are complicated by the fact that Worf was in a relationship with the Klingon Emissary. It is interesting to note that Klingon men can be as dense as human ones.
21. Peak Performance  The Enterprise is assigned to take part in a war game simulation. Cmdr. Ryker is assigned to command the opposing force and an alien strategist is sent to run the exercise. The ship Ryker is assigned is in badly deteriorated ship. It is outclassed, out gunned, out-crewed and out of luck in every way. The one thing Ryker has going for him is sneakiness. The fun part, though, is taking down the arrogant expert by a few notches.
22. Shades of Gray  Cmdr Ryker is bitten by something while doing a planetary survey and a pathogen begins to affect his nervous system. It is a fatal infection and Dr. Pulaski is at her wits end trying to combat it. She tries to stimulate his brain with electricity and that seems to help but puts in a dream state. Yep.

1686295,5,B000062XFG,"As has been discussed at length by other reviewers, the remastering work is astonishing. This season is not the show's pinnacle - though it does have its highlights - so my rating is not based on the quality of the episodes so much as the quality of the presentation. The picture and sound quality are not always consistent but are, for the most part, excellent. Far better than you'll see on television or current online streaming versions, and the updated special effects make this a version that you've never seen in any format. This is - and I believe will remain - the definitive version of TNG, and any fan with the cash would do well add these these seasons to their collection.",1402444800,,685,4.5772357723577235

1686303,3,B000062XFG,"I recently bought season 2 of TNG and was mostly very impressed with the picture and sound quality of this disc. I found this season's picture quality to appear crisper and sharper than season 3 onwards. However this doesn't come without a few minor complaints. Occasionally there seems to be some harsh grain in cut scenes, and sometimes it seems like bad 3D where characters appear on a different 'layer' to the background. But these quirks occur rarely.  The biggest problem I have with Season 2 is the quality of the show. Doctor Pulaski is a horrid woman, that seems to find it impossible to be nice to anyone and regards Data as a glorified toaster.  There are a lot of weak plots that serve only to push moral messages. I know that's a common Star Trek theme, but season 3 onwards usually manage a little more sublety and intelligence. Unnatural Selection recycles an old TOS episode idea and Shades of Gray regrettably doesn't involve Pulaski and Riker in a kinky S&M scene but instead is a cheap 'relive your memories' episode. But don't think I hate Season 2. It has it's moments although it's not a favourite and I will sell it on.",1400112000,,1142,4.5931372549019605

1686306,3,B000062XFG,"I didn't find the Second Season to be as good as the 1st. I liked Riker's beard <3  The ""new doctor"" was pretty good and changed up the show.  Whoopi Goldberg was a good addition -- in fact, introducing both the ""new doctor"" and the new lounge area was awesome in the 1st episode -- showed that The Enterprise was larger than we originally thought or it had been remodeled :-)

As for viewing the season in general ... I have an older computer. I'm running a MacBook with OS 10.5.8. I don't know if it's because I have an older computer or it's just Amazon in general but I had *numerous* times where the episode would stop and have to ""buffer"".  I had many times where the episode froze completely and I had to force my computer to shut down by holding the start button. This has continued into the 3rd season as well so it may be my computer.  I did not notice it as badly in the 1st season.

Star Trek TNG made countless advancements in the development of technology and sci-fi filmmaking, largely due to a new but remarkable company names Industrial Light and Magic.  With a great host of characters, this second year in the second series in the popular and profitable franchise, the USS Enterprise has some remarkable encounters with both cosmological adventures and a host of interesting aliens.

These re-released blurays take an old grainy memory and turn them into gorgeous pixel-perfect high definition and essentially bring new life to the series which was shot on film, but broadcast in standard definition.

The beauty of old series being shot on film is that they can be scanned at a higher resolution even 4k or beyond and that old detail can be brought up to today's standards.

The producers of this series did not stop there.  After scanning in the film, the digital effects were updated.  It's a spectacular upgrade to an old favorite.  I was blown away and am happy with the purchase to say the least.

The remastered version is wonderful. The CGI/exterior shots of the Enterprise D were beautifully redone without ruining the original look of the show. The panels and instruments on the walls are much more clear, and you can see a noticeable difference in just about everything else. The sound quality is also better. Note, this is just from streaming on Amazon Prime (although I have watched in blu ray as well and it's very close in detail). Despite being shot in the 80's, this show really stood the test of time. Some episodes didn't even need fancy CGI or a big budget to be excellent material.

Season 2 itself, like the internet says, when Riker grew his beard this show got awesome. There were many more quality episodes in season 2 than in season 1. The writing was great and there are alot of good, classic episodes like ""Elementary Dear Data"". Overally a very enjoyable season of Star Trek (although not quiet the best but close).

All that I can say is that this is one of those phenomenal series that will live on, for a very very long time. Season two is no different than the other seasons in the quality of its productions and stories and acting. I realize that ST: TNG is not everybody's cup of tea but it certainly is mine, and I don't mind that others don't like it or may not like.

Only thing I have to say against is the picture quality...it seems to be mastered from VHS as the images are grainy and not actualiy DVD quality. Since this is the first edition of DVDs released by Paramount, I am not that all surprised since many DVDs from that time where not re-mastered for picture quality but more to take advantage of 5.1 digital surround (no complaints there...sound is great). For the price, It works out for me since the Blu-Rays and latter DVD realeses are just way to expensive for my budget. This set was at a good price and I feel I got my money's worth which is why, even though the picture quality is not perfect for DVD standard, I am giving it four stars for content, audio and packaging.

This is when the series really started to come into its own. I want to specifically comment about the HD version of this. It is amazing! You'll never want to go back to the SD version again. The only slightly negative thing I can say about the HD version is that it's not widescreen. However, this is due to the way the original was filmed; they framed the shots for 4:3. If they were to convert it to 16:9 there would have been set elements visible in the additional screen space.

1686376,4,B000062XFG,"Season 1 of TNG is pretty clunky.  In Season 2, one of the all-time great tv series starts to look a lot more familiar.  You get a lot more character development, Wesley Crusher's boy-wonder character is used in better and more realistic ways and minimized, Geordi and Worf, the actors who play them, begin to up their game and become more like real people.  Patrick Stewart (Picard) and Brent Spiner (Data) really find the essence of their characters here with the writers leaving PIcard's grumpy-old-man traits from season 1 behind in favor of the poet-archaeologist-diplomat that we all know and love.  ""Measure of a Man"" is the season highlight; it should have won a writing Emmy or acting Emmy or both.  It's a perfect hour of television.  There are hits and misses resulting from 1) rushed scripts due to a writers' strike and 2) the unsuccessful attempt to work Dr. Pulaski, an unlikeable character, into the cast, something that was rectified by writing the character out after a single season.  TNG doesn't really get going and start firing on all cylinders until Season 3, but there's a lot to love here and anyone interested in Trek should watch all of TNG in order, not go skipping around.  The HD/Remastered version is gorgeous.  Stunning quality.",1384905600,,1260,4.850467289719626

- Works on my dated media players for PC
- Works on DVD player
- Typically 4 Episodes per CD, with Episode number/name on them individually.
- Menu interface is well organized and very well done (i.e.options, scene selection, episodes have auto-playing mini-clips above their titles)

I'm very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection. I took a gamble buying the full set of this version, but I found it was truly worth it. Did I mention I love this show? I tend to forget the show was filmed in the 80's and early 90's. A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.

While it didn't have an overarching story arc like Babylon 5, the wild fantasy palette of Farscape and seems tame in comparison to the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, it brought the Star Trek franchise back to life and allowed it to mature.

1686485,2,B000062XFG,"Star Trek Next Generation had some good episodes in its run. (Season Four, for example, had a number of tight, well written, well-directed and acted episodes.) But many of the episodes in season two were pretty dismal. Some were okay, but the bad ones were so bad, they almost sunk the series.

For example, consider ""Shades of Grey,"" an episode in which Riker is bitten by a bug, then lies around for a few days in a coma remembering (dreaming) pointless vignettes from previous episodes. Deanna Troi and Doctor Polaski stand around his comatose body making weird cartoon-sad faces, and delivering truly horrific soap-opera-quality dialogue.

I found this episode so appalling, stupid, poorly written, directed and acted, that I did a web search for online reviews to see how others felt about it. I found the following comments from the show's creators. Even the writers and producers were aware that it truly stunk. I had to edit them to take out the profanity, because there was so much of it in the quotes that Amazon deleted my first attempt at a review!

'This episode is thought to be one of the weakest ever made. Maurice Hurley, who co-wrote the episode, commented, ""Piece of s ***. It was supposed to be a bottle show. Terrible, just terrible, and a way to save some money. I was on the way out the door."" (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages)'

'In 2012, Peter Lauritson recalled the episode, saying ""It was just... we learned from that. I think, probably the worst we ever did. It was like ""Never again."" ""Shades""... I don't even want to remember it."" Likewise, David Livingston also commented ""It's very cheesy and the fans didn't like it.'

'Ronald D. Moore called it ""embarrassing"". (AOL chat, 1997)'

It's nice at least to read their comments admitting what a piece of garbage the episode was. God, it was awful. Uck.

If you're looking for the ""good"" STNG episodes, start with season 3. And definitely get season 4. But skip this one. Some episodes, like ""Shades,"" are horrific.",1366156800,,2015,4.80635838150289

1686502,1,B000062XFG,"Here's the deal, I bought some tires and got a $70 rebate credit card. STNG had just come out in the re-released version. I lacked seasons 2 and 7. I already had seasons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, in the first low quality dvd release. So, I sprung for either a new or a used bluray copy of STNG because the price was comparable to the NEWEST dvd re-release of the show.

Disappointments:

1)Yeah, BLURAYS are special but WHY put an EXPENSIVE and SPECIAL restoration project in a ""DIMESTORE"" bluray case? What does that packaging cost A DOLLAR? When I got the bluray season two the binder part had come UNCLIPPED from the back of the binder. I was afraid it was broken and that my discs were scratched. I got lucky and all I had to do was to clip the binder back into the case, but a clip from the front part of the case came busted off. The clip is what would hold any insert that might have come with the bluray set.

2) There was SNOW in at least the FIRST EPISODE. What should have been a SOLID background, instead showed some sort of pixelation or DUSTY appearance, for a period of time. I was pretty UPSET because this was a STATE OF THE ART BLURAY RESTORATION. That being said the SNOW portion hasn't really show up again and I've watched about three episodes. But the SNOW effect is a BLURAY DEFECT. Somebody didn't do their job, not quality control and not some TECHNICAL person. I still can't F'ing believe it. The show effect sort of looked like the transporter effect when a person is broken down into atoms for transport.

The original release of STNG put the dvds in very durable boxes. Whoever was in charge of this bluray project was very disrespectful to the fans. You know, I'm not quite a GEEK who sits around watching Star Trek. I don't go to conventions. I'm not a DIE HARD FAN but the SUITS in charge of this re-release have been DISRESPECTFUL to the FANS of this show. I guess I should be happy the manufacturer didn't wrap the discs in plastic wrap and thrown them in a bubble envelope. You Mother *&^%%()+'s, why do you think people BUY BOOTLEG products? Why do you think people STEAL? Why should we RESPECT your INDUSTRY when you don't respect us?

I spent about $45 on this product and I got a ""FRAGILE"" and ""slightly damaged and flimsy case"" which barely protects the blue ray discs. And the manufacturer didn't even get the first episode reproduced properly.

In short, maybe you should buy a bootleg of this bluray project, or maybe the ""newest"" dvd release wasn't as half arsed as this.

The POWERS THAT BE need to GET OVER the TINY is BETTER idea. Those TINY BLURAY cases are not made to hold FIVE or more discs. And you can't stack ANY weight on them because they are DELICATE. You MUST store the BLUERAYS STANDING UP.

The first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation wasn't a complete success but it proved one thing... that lightning could strike twice. Something many people thought was impossible, a new Star Trek series could survive in syndication. The question from there was whether the second season of voyages of the USS Enterprise and her crew could eclipse the success of the first season.

Season one of TNG was unevenly written due to a revolving door of writers and the second season is even more uneven because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. That strike led to scripts from the abandoned Star Trek: Phase II to be rewritten for the TNG characters and also led to Star Trek's one and only clip show. The ratio of good to bad episodes leans more towards the bad than season one which makes working through the season more of an arduous journey than some fare weather fans may be willing to invest in.

Even with the higher amount of `bad' episodes the character development in season two is much improved. The entire cast is given more breathing room; Picard is less stiff, Riker and Worf were injected with more humor, Wil Wheaton is less annoying, Marina Sirtis becomes a little less crazy, and Levar Burton is given a more prominent position. Diana Muldaur replaced Gates McFadden as the Chief Medical Officer, something that would only last one season. The cast is more comfortable with one another and play off each other more naturally, something that would be expanded on more in season three.

Season Two highlights include: Elementary, Dear Data, Loud as a Whisper, A Matter of Honor, The Measure of a Man, The Icarus Factor, Q Who?, and The Emissary

Season Two low points include (but are not limited to): The Child, The Outrageous Okona, The Royale, Pen Pals, Up the Long Ladder, and Shades of Grey

Video and audio quality are much improved over the original broadcasts, DVD releases, and what's being shown in current syndication. The series' original aspect ratio of 1:33.1 is maintained instead of trying to reformat the show for 16:9 HDTVs. Colors and clarity have been improved by re-scanning the original camera negatives into high definition and completely reassembling the episodes. The 7.1 DTS-MA audio track is encompassing. There's a good amount of ambient sound effects, phasers and torpedoes rip across the sound field, the warp engines provide an underlying hum while on board the ship, and the dialogue is always clear and centralized. Jerry Goldsmith's opening score sounds as timeless as ever, the same goes for the episode scores of Ron Jones.

All the special effects including the model shots, matte paintings, early CGI, and effects done on video have been re-scanned or in cases where the effects could not be salvaged have been redone. All of this work was done in house by CBS for the first season; for season two some of the work was outsourced to another company. Unfortunately, that has lead to some of the effects shots not looking as great. Some planet flybys and effects involving the Enterprise look out of place when compared to the work done by CBS. Most of these shots are still an upgrade over the standard definition effects from the show's original run but it would have been nice to have these effects be consistent throughout the show. Hopefully this is something that will be corrected for TNG's third season.

If getting a TNG restored in 1080P High Definition wasn't enough the Blu-ray sets also include some great special features. Episode promos are available before the start of every episode, I think this is a great touch because it gives you a great glimpse of what the show resembled before the restoration. LeVar Burtons 1988 Reading Rainbow segment from when he visits the set is included, I believe this is the first time it has been made available to the public outside of reruns or viewing it on YouTube. There's also a ten minute gag reel and audio commentaries available on The Measure of a Man and Q, Who?. The best special features are available on the final disc; Reunification: 25 Years After Star Trek: The Next Generation (1 hr, 2 min) and the two part documentary Make it So: Continuing Star Trek: The Next Generation, Part 1: Strange New Worlds (39 min) & Part 2: New Life and New Civilizations (42 min). There's some overlap between them but they offer an intriguing look look at the series from both behind and in front of the camera. Reunification offers viewers a rare look at TNG with the entire cast discussing the series together while Make it So looks more at individual issues or episodes. If you watch all three you're in for a treat and and it hardly feels like two plus hours have gone after watching them.

Before wrapping up the special features section, two versions of the heralded episode The Measure of a Man are available. A 57 minute extended cut and a 55 minute `hybrid' cut that intermixes HD footage with SD footage. There's been a lot of talk about the extended cuts of this episode and while I think a lot of the footage is interesting some of it is a little too on the noise. I still prefer the broadcast cut of the episode over either extended version.

Season two of Star Trek: The Next Generation should be an easy sell on Blu-ray for most fans but it's not without its problems. The cast and crew start to find their `sea' legs by this point but the writer's strike really hurt this season. There are some very memorable moments in season two; TNG's signature villain is established, Whoopi Goldberg joins, and Riker grows his iconic beard but there's also the clip show, an episode with Joe Piscapo, and the one where Data wears the cowboy hat just to name a few. This is not a season I'd revisit very often but the completist in me has to have it but I'd be lying if I didn't say I sorta wish I could have skipped straight to season three.",1360454400,,6615,4.827007943512798
1686525,4,B000062XFG,"Originally airing from 1988 to 1989, the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was beset by challenges. A writer's strike crippled Hollywood between seasons and the show was almost cancelled as a result. The producers were able to get around the problem by re-tasking scripts from the aborted Star Trek: Phase II TV show from the 1970s, reducing the season order by four episodes and - in a fit of true desperation - dropping a clip show (the terrifyingly awful Shades of Grey, widely-acknowledged as the worst episode of the entire franchise) into the mix. They scraped through to produce a season that is a notable improvement over the first year, and definitely better than it has any right to be given the situation it was produced under.

As with the first season, things get off to a bumpy start but improve later on. Fortunately, they improve a lot faster. The first two episodes, The Child (Troi gets pregnant with a rapidly-evolving alien thingamajig) and Where Silence Has Lease (the Enterprise gets stuck in a void in space where an alien superintelligence messes around with them just because that's how it rolls), are pretty bad but there is a quantum leap in improvement when Elementary, Dear Data comes on. Excellent performances and a strong script alleviate the somewhat ropey rules the show is establishing regarding the holodeck. Weaker episodes continue to roll in - The Outrageous Okona (slightly tepid conman comes on board), The Dauphin (Wesley Crusher romance episode...NO!), The Royale (crew encounter weird hotel IN SPACE) and Up the Long Ladder (outrageous Irish stereotyping) should all be burned - but there's also a better sense of the characters getting their own voices and characterisation becoming more consistent.

More to the point, the season gives us a larger number of very good episodes compared to the first. A Matter of Honour is terrific fun, establishing Riker as the first officer of a Kling Bird of Prey during an officer exchange programme. Jonathan Frakes - whose acting powers have now been radically enhanced by The Beard - steps up his game a lot. Contagion is a very dumb episode about computer viruses, but as an action romp it's very entertaining (similar to The Arsenal of Freedom in Season 1, but better). Peak Performance from later in the season is in a similar vein. Time Squared is a creepy episode about time loops and features some disturbing ideas and a doom-laden atmosphere, though some questionable writing for Picard prevents it from fulfilling its full promise. The Emissary is an important episode for Worf and the progression of his character arc and is very solid.

More impressively, this season gives us the first two hands-down, no-questions, absolute 'classic' episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. First up is The Measure of a Man, written by Melinda Snodgrass (best-known as the co-editor of the Wild Cards superhero books series). The episode is an examination of whether Data is a sentient being or not, and features some terrific acting from Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Jonathan Frakes. It's a morality play, the sort of thing that Trek can make tedious if it mishandles it, but here the team do an exemplary job of exploring the issues and turning them into a riveting hour of television (and it is an hour, as the Blu-Ray set features the hitherto-unseen 60-minute cut of the episode before it was trimmed down to the normal 44 minutes).

Even more impressive is Q Who? This episode is notable for introducing the Borg, but it's also a masterclass in pacing, music (the score is incredibly ominous), exposition without getting leaden (the hints to the past antagonism between Guinan and Q are played just right), tension, action and a genuinely surprising ending: arguably the only time on ST:TNG that the crew 'lose' the struggle of the episode and only barely survive. It's also the one and only time that Q is effectively used as a dramatically intense character. His other appearances either misfire or are played for comedy. Here we see John De Lancie at his absolute best, particularly in the scene where he pitifully tells Picard what is happening is no illusion after eighteen Enterprise crewmembers are killed by the Borg. The climactic scene where Picard begs Q to save them before they are all slaughtered is handled pitch-perfectly by Patrick Stewart (who was genuinely troubled by the episode's message that the Enterprise crew can't win all the time) as well.

Whilst Season 2 will never be remembered as the best season of the show, it does feature two of its finest hours and a whole host of other, very solid episodes. The cast turn in excellent performances, particularly Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski in her own season on the show (replacing Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher, who was sacked for criticising the show's sexist scripts in the first season; internal and fan pressure resulted in her reinstatement for Season 3). It's a shame we didn't get to see Pulaski again, as the evolution of her character arc and the development of her relationships with Worf and Data were very well-handled over the course of the season.

As with the first season, the restoration job has done a pretty good job. However, a different team was used for the second season and there is the sense that a few corners were cut. The redone effects aren't quite as well-handled as in the first season (particularly noticeable in Q Who?, though the original version of the episode had a few iffy effects issues as well, so perhaps it was unsalvageable) and the new team have only cleaned up the planets that the Enterprise orbits, rather than replacing them with fully-convincing 3D spheres. Whilst the improvements are still light-years beyond what people might be expecting, they're not quite as jaw-dropping as the job that was done on Season 1. This is made up for a bit by the other extras, which are impressive. The highlight is a lengthy roundtable discussion between the entire cast about the show and what it meant for their careers and legacies, although the ongoing 'history of the series' documentary is also excellent. The original DVD extras are also included, though again only in standard definition.

The second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (****) sees the show improving by leaps and bounds over the weaker first year. It is available now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA. The third season - often regarded as the show's finest season - will be released in April.",1360281600,,6487,4.897179253867152

As far as the Blu-Ray goes, I was quite disappointed visually in season 2. CBS did the restoration on season 1 themselves, but outsourced season 2, and the company that did the restoration really dropped the ball. It is the number one complaint that you will read in forums across the internet. It still looks better than it ever has, but the picture quality is really inconsistant from one shot to the next. Some scenes are VERY heavy grain, and look like they actually took wide-shots and tried to zoom in on the film elements. Other shots look like they had heavy use of Digital Noise Reduction used. The outcry from videophiles has been so vocal, I am surprised that CBS hasn't issued a disc-exchange like they did in season 1. All I can say is, I hope they don't screw up season 3 like they did with season 2.

It is still the best the show has ever looked, a huge upgrade from SD, but man, someone needs to be fired over this. It is like the restoration was done by people who had little understanding of HD.",1359590400,,1279,4.438297872340425

1686538,4,B000062XFG,"I found out that the Blu Ray restoration for the even numbered series is being farmed out to another company, I'm not sure if this explains the drop in picture quality compared to season 1 (which looked brilliant).  However in quite a few episodes there is some very noticeable grain in the picture (these aren't even low light scenes).  However, this is still the best that ST TNG has ever looked, you'll notice the sets have improved (in series 1, just look at the floor, you'll notice dirty carpets, carpets that are cut badly or loose on the floor), also the actors seem a lot more comfortable working opposite eachother.  Having said that, the departure of Gates McFadden is pretty glaring and the inclusion of Dr Pulaski..... frankly she comes across as a bit of a.............  well.. fill in your own words there.  There seems to be a bit more humor here even in the more serious toned episodes and it was nice to have the option of watching the full version of ""Measure Of A Man"".  Some of the extra's are compiled mainly of interviews, such as the extra about the restoration of Season 2 that's mainly interviews without any ""Before & After"" comparison footage and only a bit of footage about using CGI to enhance the look of the borg ship.  Again, unknown if this is because this season was farmed out to a different company and no one bothered to work on the extra's.  Still, the reunion interview with some of the cast is good.  The original Season 2 Promo has to be seen to be believed (it's really tacky and badly done, I'm surprised anyone tuned in to watch the series when that aired), still, it's good to see the difference between the Video broadcast and what you see in the blu ray.

While Season 1 was more in line with the remastered TOS with updated planets that look fantastic etc. we see the opposite in Season 2. The Studio hired was lazy and it shows. Instead of lush looking planets we are left with 1980s era bitmap planets that look entirely out of place.

Even worse the Studio hired to do this work was so lazy they could not even ensure shots were composited correctly so there is even a scene where the Enterprise is not placed properly and half the saucer section is missing even though the scene extends beyond where the missing saucer section is.

LAZY LAZY LAZY and ultimately CHEAP. I almost feel required to recommend people only by the ODD number seasons as those are done in house.",1358467200,10,997,4.437158469945355

The treatment of ""The Measure of a Man,"" though, is enough to justify the purchase.

There is no way to describe how differently CDR Maddox will appear after watching the director's cut.  To say more would be a sin.

Aside from that, this is the TNG ensemble in full flower, approaching the greatness of Season Three.  I sincerely hope all TNG fans with BD capability will indulge themselves.  This is primo work.",1357689600,,506,4.555555555555555

This season of the show is where it really comes into it's own, and sets the pace for the rest of the series. Despite what other reviewers have said about the quality of the remastering, I can honestly say that I have not noticed any serious faults in the quality of this season vs the season 1 bluray. In terms of entertainment, this season is so much better than the first that I am just happy to be able to watch these episodes in 1080p, and I hope season 3 doesn't take too much longer to remaster.

1686545,5,B000062XFG,"This review is for the Blu-Ray release.

I'm sure you've seen people complaining that this release was grainy, low quality, or otherwise not that great.  Well, partially, they're right.  There are some scenes that look grainier than others, or effects shots that don't look as good as the rest.  It's noticeable, but still looks 100 times better than the DVD.  Plus, the shots are few and far between.  But there are scenes that looked like garbage before and look amazing now, so take the bad with the good.  Are there any other decades-old TV series getting this kind of treatment?  I think not!

However, I'm not deducting any stars for any graininess because of two things:  Firstly, the film stock, as of this writing, is 25 years old.  Of course it's not going to look like it was shot yesterday!  These releases are literally a ""Film Restoration Project"" and not claiming to be shot yesterday.  Secondly, I popped in my DVD copy of ""Q Who"" (A fairly effects heavy episode) and then watched the Blu-Ray copy.  The difference is night and day.  There is no comparison between the two.  Seeing the colors now the way they should have looked when the episodes first aired makes it all worth it.

All of the special features are amazing.  This includes the DVD special features, taking you around warehouses and looking at shooting models and hearing little niche stories about minute things seriously makes these Blu-Rays worth the price.  Not to mention the hour-long cast reunion where they share some intimate moments (Marina cries!) about fan interactions.

In short, the release is outstanding in all departments.  Don't listen to the people who are sitting inches from their televisions and counting the pixels or something, just sit back and enjoy this absolutely stunning restoration of season two.  It may not be as strong as the later seasons but there are a lot of really good episodes in this season, especially the extended cut of ""The Measure of a Man"" which was, and still is, outstanding.

You can very much tell the difference between season 2 and season 1. Season 1 was crisp and high quality. Season 2 has a lot of artifacts and fuzziness about it and worst of all - within individual episodes, it can be clear, HD quality in one shot and DVD like in the next. It is clear that CBS did a much better job with their transfer than the outsource firm. And I am not overly sensitive - you can definitely see the difference between the two. Now - it is still better than DVD quality overall and the bonus material is great.

Season 2 is not my favorite season, as I believe Season 3 on are the best, but still enjoyable and worth it.

1686551,4,B000062XFG,"I'll keep this one short since so many people have pointed out the main pros and cons of these discs.
Pros : These discs look way better than the DVDs did. I thought the DVD releases looked terrible. The upgraded HD special effects are wonderful and you never feel like you are wathing something newly created like the original series did (which I liked, but they gave you the original version too so that was nice). The extended version of MEASURE OF A MAN IS NICE.

Cons : Yes it is true, the film transfers have some ..... I'll call them mistakes. I'm a film maker and I used to shoot 35mm and 16mm so I know what a good transfer should look like. While the images are nice and sharp someone seemed to think that you should be able to see detail in ALL  of the shadows and in some of the space scenes. There are a few scenes where the stars of space are on a more dark gray background instead of the blackness of space. On the ship the bridge shots often look too bright and grainly with the blacks of the uniforms have grain as if they were trying to make them lighter.

In the text intro to Measure of a Man many of the remote control functions are blocked. I was not able to press pause during the text intro. I am a slow reader when text is on a television so it would have been nice to be able to stop it and take my time reading. To play it over I had to leave the episode and go to another and then come back to it because the Blu Ray was designed to remember my position in the episode. Just annoying. Plus you are forced to watch all the fbi warnings and such at the beginning of each disc.

I didn't notice too much on the extended version of MEASURE OF A MAN but then I can't say I've seen that episode enough to know all the added scenes, but it claims to be 13 minutes longer which is cool.

With all this said I'm very pleased to have purchased the set and think it is well worth the upgrade. I actually think this set has some scenes that look better than Season one, but perhaps that was the changes in film stock.

- I can live with pale, blurry planets in Season 2
- I can live with sometimes too grainy picture in some scenes

But I can NOT live with weird Enterprise shots where the ship is jolted/crimped flying over a planet, as seen in ""Loud as a Whisper"". Enough is enough, this is SO quick and dirty and totally unworthy of this iconic series.

Like they blinked, got lazy and all of a sudden, portions of scenes are NOT HD quality! Not all episodes are though.  A different farmed out restoration house worked on this season, NOT CBS!

Not sure if it's the pressings, the different film stock grain TNG used, or both..but it's DRAMATICALLY lesser quality than season 1 hands down!

1686561,5,B000062XFG,"From reading some of the reviews, you'd think this season was mastered from VHS tapes!  Quite the contrary, from what I've seen so far, I'm seeing the same quality as season one with the exception of a few issues - some of which are due to the film stock itself.  Many people have already seen the ""cloaked"" enterprise as it leaves the orbit of a planet on ""A Schizoid man.""  If I hadn't been looking for this, I doubt I'd really have seen it.  And by the time the ship is most of the way off the screen, the ""mistake"" had filled the edge properly instead of hanging a few pixels off the edge of the screen.  As for planets, to me they appear more like the originals.  Yes, I've seen one with clouds so small and uniform it looks pixelated, but for the most part they look okay.  I'm not complaining about the season one planet work, but the original planets were just a blurry mush of clouds with different colors for the different planets.  Yes, season one remasters has planets where you can see land masses and fine cloud detail, but that wasn't in the original episodes.  To me, season two just goes back to the original look of the planets having banded clouds kind of like Jupiter.  As for film grain, as others have noted, there are many shots that appear very grainy compared to others, but even on the extras, people working on the show admit that they were trying different film stocks in season two.  If you want to fault someone for grainy video in the blu-ray, fault the original producers for using bad film.  By the way, audio seems first rate from what I can tell so far.

If you're quite anal about the most minor speck of grain, or a few times the warp nacels look turquoise as opposed to blue (which could very well be due to film stock), don't buy the set!  Go ahead and cut off your nose to spite your face!  Just let the rest of us enjoy one of our favorite shows looking like it was created today.  And we'll complain about something worth complaining about - like the extreme compression and harsh clipping of almost all music put out on CD in the last 15 years!!!",1356307200,3,2089,4.331619537275064

My son and I watched season 1 in its entirety and saw nothing of the kind.  Very disappointing.

On the second episode, same thing on a couple scenes later on... but thank god it wasn't as much as episode 1 had.

Did no one pop the disc into their Blu-Ray player and actually watch this before putting it on the store shelves??

Also, the blue planet scene in episode 1 or 2 (don't remember which), it looked just awful.  Now I have a 73"" TV, so I know details get blown up... but it was kinda pathetic looking in this case.

I would like to return this to amazon, but it's open ... all they can do is send me another equally inferior HD restoration.  A little annoying HD restoration on a 55"" TV screen is unbearably annoying on a 10ft wide screen. I really don't want to watch the rest of the episodes ... so maybe I can beg amazon for a refund.

Paramount should of waited a year between each season and do the restoration correctly.  Probably some restoration outfit that made the lowest bid, promised to do the restoration at warp speeds ... not because they were good at it with many years of experience with a lot of their reputation riding on the results ... nooooo... it was because they knew how to game the system, meet the contratual requirements (which were probably poorly written), and get paid and not suffer from poor feedback ... because they are laughing all the way to the bank!  I'll blame Paramount for writing poor quality requirements and not managing and demanding better quality before release.  I'll not buy another season until they correct the remaster for Season 2.

Anyone have a direct email for paramount STTNG restoration team?  I feel like unloading my mind on them for such poor quality.  This is Star Trek, not some Gomer Pyle episode.

Edit:  I lowered my rating from 2 to 1 after I saw the toy star ship with blue blooming engines in the Q episode with the borg.  Just a lazy effort with no consequences.  Too bad.

Edit:  Dear Cody:  Since you watched Season 2, I'll respond.  The equipment I used (studio monitor and projector) to base my comments upon is all based on LUT image
processors.  It's what hollywood post production facilities use for the director to watch Blu Ray content prior to release to the public.  The dark shadow areas in Season 2 are
plagued with dark color compression artifacts (noise).  This is a symptom of poor quality source material (what you ended up after the remaster).  Season 1 did not have this.
Also, image detail was notably sacrificed as seen with the Star Ship Enterprise looking ""toy"" like, also a symptom of a poor quality master.  The point is that the people who did
Season's 2 remaster saw this, and still released it, knowing it was greatly inferior to Season 1.  It's professionally unacceptable and they need strong feedback from people who
have the ability to do so, as many others have done, to correct their behavior.",1356307200,11,2468,4.635944700460829

I don't know what happened, but some episodes look remarkable, and some look pretty sub-standard. ""The Schizoid Man"" in particular leapt out as a particularly bad transfer; I've got nothing against grain, it's just that there's a general lack of sharpness, and lazy effects remastering (compared to the stunning job done on the first season).

Of course, everything else is great (sound, special features, etc). The thing is, if the first release had been this quality, we all probably wouldn't have known the difference.. but because the Season 1 blu-ray set the bar so high, this mysterious drop in quality is quite puzzling. Still, an essential release TNG fans.

Others (like me, in this case) are just curious to see what other people are saying and have already decided to make the purchase.  Like many other reviewers here, I'm a diehard Star Trek fan, I love everything connected to the Star Trek franchise (with maybe the exception of Star Trek 2009, but that's a whole other story).  But if you're like me and already own the DVD releases of TNG and want to see it in much better quality, then you're going to want to buy this, no matter what the reviews say.

Yes there is some inconsistent graininess, and yes sometimes it looks like more than just film grain (a few of the scenes remind me of when we used an antenna on our TV and the channel wasn't tuned properly) and yet it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be, in other words, it's not a ""deal-breaker""

There's just so much to love about this Season Two Blu-ray release, you can easily get your money's worth with just a small fraction of what it has to offer.  For example, the three versions of ""Measure of a Man"", the regular hi-def version, the extended cut, and the extended hybrid cut.  The hybrid cut is very cool because it's kind of like a behind-the-scenes look at the episode - no sound effects (you can hear how the sliding doors actually sound on the set), no music, no chroma key efx in some scene, and no transporter efx in some scenes (they just kind of fade in and out on the transporter pad with no sparkles).  Even though some of these scenes are VHS quality, it's a fascinating look at an episode in it's rawest form, before post-production gets a hold of it.

Add to that all the other extras in the set, IMHO, it's worth the price alone.  But then you also get the episodes, for the most part, crystal clear.  You can read the LCARS display when Data picks out ""the comic"" and realize the comic's name is Ron D. Moore!

I was always unhappy with the fact that the regular TOS dvd's looked better than TNG dvd's.  I always though it was odd that something made in the 60's looked better than something made in the late 80's.  But no more, now you can see these episodes ""the way they were meant to be seen""

I'm not discounting the complaints other reviewers have made, their complaints have merit....a better job could have been done.  But as I said, if you are a Star Trek fan, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't want to get this Blu-Ray set.

1686568,3,B000062XFG,"Alright, for those of us who know, Season 2 was outsourced to HTV, and therefore some of the remastering, specifically the VFX, are a suspect.  So what exactly is the deal?  Well, here's what I can gather from watching all the episodes.

1) The model used for the ENT-D wasn't the same across all shots.  The difference can be seen most noticeably in the deflector dish on the front of the secondary hull.  For some reason, this thing gets a bit blurry as if the whole model was a shotty CGI model...which it may have been, I don't know.  Internal lights are sometimes absent for whatever reason.  Again, I suspect that it's a CG model.  Also the glow of the nacelles and the bussard collector are a bit too much, washing the rear half of the ship with a blue glow.

2) The planets.  Quite frankly, most are pretty good.  Only the one blue one with the horizontal cloud patterns is about the only really bad one.  The big difference between Season 1 and Season 2 here is that not all of Season 2's planet rotate (which was a priority for the guy that modeled Season 1's planets.)

3) Transporter beams.  THIS IS THE BIG ONE.  It appears HTV did not use remastered HD effects for these.  They appear pretty close to the original low-res versions.  Probably just upscaled versions of the original, and it shows.  Why HTV just didn't use the remastered versions CBS Digital created, I'll never know.  I mean, a transporter beam effect is a transporter beam effect.  Not much difference between who's being beamed in and out.

4) Film grain.  Yes, it's true that the film grain is a bit more extensive in this release, but some of that may be due to the different film stocks used in post Season 1 seasons.  They even state in the extras that the first episode ""The Child"" that they experimented with different film stocks.  As the episode opens, the first shot of the bridge we get is VERY grainy.  But calms down in subsequent shots and episodes.  So I suspect this is due to the different film stocks.  BUT what I will say is this...due to these different film stocks from Season 1 is that we get a more natural filmic look to the show.  Sure the grain rears its ugly head at times, but the show looks a bit more realistic this way IF...you view it from a distance.  Preferably greater than 10 ft on an average sized HDTV (46-55"" range).

But other than that, I give the set 3.5-stars.  I take off 1.5 stars for the lazy VFX work and not controlling some of the excessive film grain.",1355702400,3,2482,4.424778761061947
1686569,3,B000062XFG,"However, whoever did the remastering really let us and all of humankind down with the shoddy work they did on this season.

Granted, quite a bit of it looks and sounds good.  But what looks bad, looks really really bad.  Did they let some idiot right out of university do the restoration?  I actually replaced my hdmi cables and reset my receiver and tv back to defaults 10 minutes through the first episode because I was convinced there must be some sort of hardware failure that happened when I powered it all up.  But no, it's actually just a poorly done restoration/video mastering job.

The most obvious failure I've seen so far is the cut-off saucer section in 'The Schizoid Man'.
There are however also a couple of shots when the Enterprise (which is kind of the star of the show) looks just blurry and lacks much of the detail that you can see in other shots. It looks like the various layers from which the ship is composed (model, lights etc) are not layered correctly thus creating a positional offset which eg. detaches the running lights from the ship and creates a fuzzy image which is totally not blu ray quality!

I encourage everyone to speak up and I really hope that CBS will reconsider outsourcing any more seasons - and if they do they should CAREFULLY review the work from the external studio!
I was really looking forward to the second season, but this leaves me with a bitter taste of being ripped off!!

Though some episodes are really great (I loved the extended cut of ""The Measure of a Man"") and the picture quality is not consistently bad, this whole release leaves me with the feeling of having bought a new car (which I was looking forward to for month) which than arrived with a flat tire and a small scratch in the painting...",1355529600,,1347,4.516393442622951
1686571,4,B000062XFG,"I have just completed watching the Season 2 set and quite simply the season has never looked better.

Now I am aware that there have been a lot of negative comments on some of the special effect restorations in season 2. Many Star Trek fan sites have commented on these issues, however, I can confidently say that overall these issues represent less than 5% of the entire season.

Season 2 was given to a separate company than Season 1. Season 1 was completed by CBS Digital and they did an amazing job. Season 2 was completed by HTV Illuminate and there are definitely some special features that were poorly restored. For example, in the Schizoid Man a couple of planet shots look like they have been upscaled from DVD. Additionally, there are some shots where the Enterprises passes through the side of the screen and part of the Enterprise disappears! It is quite shocking that they missed it but you can clearly see it at the end of that episode. Most of the special effect mistakes seem contained to several episodes.

Overall, the special effects have been wonderfully restored. I ran my TNG DVDs side by side on some episodes and the difference is remarkable in many cases.  Its unfortunate that some of the special effects were restored poorly, which puts a bit of a stain on the entire season, however, like I said I strongly believe this is less than 5% of the season.

The live action shots look so much better than my season 2 DVDs the comparison isn't even close. Clealy, this is how this show was meant to be seen.

The audio tracks have also been completely redone and it sounds so much stronger and powerful, especially in the low end. I listened to the season on a 5.1 setup and it felt much more immersive and strong.

In summary, I think this Season 2 BluRay set is a must own for any Star Trek TNG Fan. It is quite simply an amazing restoration. These is definitely some moments where you might groan a bit at the special effect but seriously for the most part they look much better. The audio restoration is also top notch.",1355356800,,2044,4.508108108108108

1686574,5,B000062XFG,"There's a reason we buy things on Blu-Ray. Usually it's because we've upgraded our living rooms to bigger screens, now that prices on them have come within reach. And lately, prices on quality audio for them are also coming within reach. Getting a 7.1 or 5.1 audio track with lossless audio on a cherished television series or favorite film now really immerses one in the experience, especially when the screen is filling our vision almost like a private screening.

But you know all that.

Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season Two on Blu-Ray fulfills the promise of delivering a quality image, not just an upscaled TV image, but a cleaned-up, re-digitized, and in some cases, elements re-filmed, re-mastered, re-composited, television series, this time done in HD, but still unfortunately has to stay in 4:3 aspect ratio. The original media just did not have the extra wide information captured on film.

However, where a DVD will seem blurry and indistinct, you will have amazing crispness and detail suddenly pop out at you, things you've never seen before. There's too many examples to mention - and definitely worth leaving as a wonderful surprise for you to try and take in, noticing for yourself episode after episode.

The old DVD extra content is as well sharpened up. As far as new extras for this release, don't expect too many.

Season 2 looks terrible! It's really sad and frustrating that this was actually approved of by CBS. The space shots are now totally inconsistent from the Season 1 space shots. Planets look blurry, the Enterprise looks unrealistic in certain scenes compared to the previous release. Even some of the interior shots with the actors look grainy.

The only postives are the extras like the extended cut of The Measure of a Man with commentary, gag reel and new docs along with the old docs from the DVDs. Still, it's ridiculous at the quality drop for the actually episodes.",1355011200,10,748,4.62406015037594

1686578,3,B000062XFG,"Just purchased the set upon it's release, so it'll be months before I finish viewing the full-season (am in no hurry to view the tragic episode ""Shades Of Gray"" anyway).  Nevertheless, even at this point, I'd have to add my voice to the chorus of reviewers indicating the inferiority of the quality of this release compared to season-one.

What is a bit unnerving is that as a TREKfan, I've followed months of interviews published with many of the individuals involved in the process of this season's BluRay-release (the Okuda's for instance).  While they frequently indicated that season-two's work had been outsourced, their reassurance and praise for what they were promoting was unending.  So either it's a lack of objectivity on their parts, that they cannot see what even the least-technical of viewers can easily report, or their desire to promote the sale of this product means they'll say anything.

Fortunately I do expect that season-three, now being prepped for release by the same CBS-Digital team that so outstandingly improved season-one, will be quite excellent.  Maybe, by then, we'll hear some collective mea culpa from the powers-that-be over the inferior product which they've released here with season-two.  With season-four also being outsourced, I already worry that it will be a disappointment unless there's an acknowledgement that it needs to be done better.

In all fairness, I intend to update my comments after I've seen more of the episodes.  Thanks for taking a moment to consider my opinions.",1354838400,27,1524,5.162601626016261

By comparison season two which was farmed to an outside company so that CBS could get ALL seven seasons out by the end of 2014 demonstrates how exceptional and difficult the job was to rescan the original elements and recomposite the visual effects. While this isn't a horrible job(the word sloppy comes to mind), there are issues with the second season that fans should be aware of related to the quaity of the image and the recomposite visual effects.

So--four stars for the season, three stars for the restoration work and five stars for the extras. Three and a half stars when measuring all of these elements.

First let's start with the good stuff; the second season STILL blows away the standard DVDs released nearly a decade ago and the best restoration work here does compare to the first season. The problem is that this set is inconsistent.

The 7.1 audio remix and the original soundtrack are both terrific sounding. There's considerable presence.
We get alternate audio in German, Spanish, Italian, French and Japanese. Subtitles are provided in English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish

The special features are outstanding. We get the following featurettes and documentaries which will be of interest to fans-- ""Mission Overview: Year Two"", ""Departmental Briefing: Year Two - Memorable Missions, Departmental Briefing: Year Two - Production"", ""Selected Crew Analysis: Year Two and Inside Starfleet Archives: Penny Juday - Star Trek Coordinator"". ""Reunification"" gives us a reunion of the cast that lasts a little bit over an hour. ""Making It So"" runs over 80 minutes and looks back over the series.

We also get two commentary tracks (something sorely lacking for fans of the series) on ""Measure of a Man"" by the writer of that episode Melinda Snodgrass. We also two an HD extended version of ""Measure"" (reconstructed following a VHS copy of the first cut of the episode provided by writer Snodgrass)as well as a hyrid that weaves in alternate takes, angles and features the original onset sound. We also get a commentary on the ""Q Who?"" the episode that introduced us to the Borg by VFX supervisor Dan Curry, director Rob Bowman, Michael & Denise Okuda.

We also get other featurettes including on the tech, ""Strange New Worlds"", ""New Life and Civiliations"" (which I haven't dug into yet), an episode of ""Reading Rainbow"" (Levar Burton hosted this show during the original run of the series).

Now for the not-so-good stuff in this set.

There is over use of digital noise reduction on a number of episodes including ""Measure of a Man"". This was done to reduce the level of grain but it also washes out fine detail. It still looks superior to the original DVDs.

The producers also experimented with using different film stocks during the second season to try and find the right fit for the show. As a result, grain varies quite a bit (sometimes from shot-to-shot)although the production company that did the transfer, restoration and scans SHOULD have used a tool called grain management to make the grain a bit more consistent.

The grain is a bit distracting (almost appearing to be like video noise but I suspect that it is an example of inadequate grain management and the different film stocks used more than a flaw in the transfer itself).

The visual effects composites are a bit sloppy as well. In one shot, for example of the episode ""Pen Pals"", the edge of the saucer section disappears as it speeds away from the planet. There are other issues that occur as well some of which you may or may not notice. Planets have less detail than the first season set indicating some of the digital effects aren't quite as strong here (planets were digitally recreated and replaced).

The second episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is flawed but is still superior to the DVDs. Luckily, CBS will be doing season three (although they will be alternating odd with even seasons. The good news is that the post-production house that made the mistakes on this one will not be involved in seasons 4 and 6).

I'd still recommend this set even with its flaws and I doubt that, due to the cost of the restoration, that any sort of correction will be done for this set.",1354838400,6,4509,5.077027027027027
1686580,3,B000062XFG,"Having been excited by the first season set and even attending the Fathom even previewing both ""Q Who"" and ""The Measure Of A Man"" Extended version, I was looking forward to this set.

I started with all the new extras, which look great and offer some great insight into the season.  However, when I started watching the episodes, they left me highly disappointed.  The first season set looked absolutely amazing, but this set features way too many scenes plagued by excessive grain that it almost looks like its snowing from the excessive digital noise.  And yet, other scenes or different camera angles from the same scene look great.  Its a real mixed bag.  I was hoping it might just be a bad couple of scenes in one episode, but it's a problem plaguing the entire set.  I don't know if it's the compensating for the dark lighting of this season but it doesn't have the same WOW factor as the season one set despite being much better stories than most of the first season (""Shades of Grey"" episode excluded from that assessment.)

Despite the annoying grainy scenes the set is definitely an improvement over the DVD.  Many of these episodes I haven't seen since the release of the DVD version of this season.  If the outsourcing stories are true, I hope that CBS Digital and Paramount make it right.",1354752000,4,1302,4.646288209606987
1686581,5,B000062XFG,"I received the Season 2 Next Generation blu-ray yesterday.  I have had the time to view several of the episodes.  I had read much about it and also read early reviews and looked at pre-release hi-def stills.  I am here to say that Season 2 looks amazing on blu-ray, just as Season 1 did, although the special effects work is not as consistently mind-blowing as it was for Season 1.  To my eye, many of the effects are just as good, but some are clearly inferior to Season 1.  However, this drawback hardly warrants a 1 star review for the overall release!  I challenge anyone to compare this release to the prior DVD release, and not see the vast improvement in video and audio quality.  In fact, much of the live action presentation looks absolutely gorgeous.  If you are a Star Trek fan on the fence about buying the set, I would highly recommend that you do, and that you not be dissuaded by 1 star reviews, nor by reviews of people who haven't even watched the episodes yet!  It is great and correct that Star Trek fans expect a lot from these blu-ray releases.  After all, many of us have already purchased these episodes in previous formats.  But in my opinion, this is well worth the new investment.

In addition to the vastly improved picture and sound, the release includes a multitude of extras that are almost worth the cost of admission by themselves!  It also needs to be pointed out that each season of star trek is made up of individual episodes filmed by a variety of directors who make individual decisions about lighting and overall visual presentation.  It is not realistic to expect individual episodes to look exactly the same (e.g. some will be darker or more grainy in appearance than others).

Finally, I would suggest looking at the reviews from Trekcore and blu-ray.com if you want a more detailed, and I think fair analysis, of the technical merits of this release.  I think those reviews are much more level-headed than some you will find from fans on Amazon.

Like so many Star Trek fans, I feel like the best is yet to come, and I can't wait for Season 3.  But in the meantime, enjoy the Season 2 release for all it has to offer!",1354665600,5,2159,4.506426735218509
1686582,5,B000062XFG,"I've read a few reviews on here regarding the disappointment of some fans regarding the visual quality of Season Two in comparison to Season One; to be honest I do not see much a difference.  The quality is so high that I'm actually enjoying watching Season Two for the first time.  It's always been my least-favorite season.  I'm not suggesting the other reviewers are wrong in their assessment that the video quality from Season One to Season Two is starkly different, I'm merely suggesting not everyone will notice.  It still looks amazing.  And, it's twenty-five years old.  It's not going to have the same quality as a film made this year released to Blu Ray.

On to the product itself... I could not be happier.  I watched the 25th Anniversary Reunion first, called Reunification (fitting!).  It was interesting to watch the entire main cast (minus Denise Crosby) interact with one another in a casual setting.  The fifth disc also includes two additional high-def special features that make up ""Make It So, Continuing Star Trek: The Next Generation.""  It's essentially a continuation of the mini-docs on the Season One set.  There's plenty of stock footage of old interviews, newer interviews from recent years, and even brand new interview footage of Diana Muldaur, which was was a real treat.  Gates McFadden talks candidly about why she was fired and why she came back.  John deLancie is interviewed.

I have not watched extended version of ""The Measure of a Man"" yet, but I can't wait.  The fact that we got an extended episode - fifteen or so entire extra minutes - added back into the episode in full HD where it was originally shot is amazing.  My only hope is there'll be more extended episodes on future sets.  I would love to see an extended ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" or ""The Offspring"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds"" on Season Three.  As with the first season set, the second set includes all the original episodic promos plus the original DVD extras.

As for the quality of the second season, my opinion of it has elevated over the years.  At first I was turned off because I did not like the character of Dr. Pulaski.  Diana Muldaur is a great actress, loved her on L.A. Law but I didn't feel she gelled well in the TNG cast.  I do feel if she had stuck around for the third season this would have improved, however I was happy that Gates returned to the series.  Dr. Crusher fit better.  We also get the addition of Ten Forward and Guinan, played by Whoopi Goldberg of course.  The quality of the writing clearly improved during Season Two.  Yes there are some downright silly episodes and special effects, but overall the episodes are good.  ""The Measure of a Man"" is of course, astounding.  Also good are ""Pen Pals,"" ""Elementary, Dear Data,"" ""The Emissary,"" ""Q Who?"" ""Peak Performance.""  I was very disappointed in ""Shades of Grey"" as a season-closer.  I suspect this was due to the writers's strike and the fact that the season missed four episodes.

I do hope since the even-numbered seasons are being farmed out that we get future releases more quickly.  I did read on TrekCore.com that a first quarter 2013 release is likely.",1354665600,6,3149,4.708791208791209
1686583,1,B000062XFG,"Having been blown away by the quality of the season 1 release, I was very excited to get season 2.  Then I was sad.  If the re-mastering of the Star Trek TNG blu-rays was a classroom assignment, it seems like the people who did season 1 are the kids who sat in the front row and gave it their best effort, and the studio responsible for season 2 sat in the back of the class and just did the minimum that was required.
The first season re-mastering is phenomenal.  The enhanced effects, sounds, and high quality HD make it well worth the money I paid for it.  The second season is pretty much like watching the DVDs with a player that can sharpen details and change the depth of contrast.  I'm considering returning them and getting my money back from Amazon.  As a long time Star Trek TNG fan, this is very disappointing, and it kind of pisses me off.  I've only watched 2 disks so far, but from what I've seen the best looking parts of the entire set is the LCARS menu.
I did some research and found out what everyone seems to already know.  The odd numbered seasons are the ones that they gave to a studio that would do them justice, and the odd numbered seasons were given to, I have to assume, a studio that is run by a relative of the person who made the decision of whom to give the seasons to.  If you like to pay more money for things than they are worth, then by all means buy season 2.",1354665600,14,1396,4.159851301115242
1686584,3,B000062XFG,"Star Trek Next Generation season 1 Blu-ray was completely done in-house by CBS Digital and was a fantastic remastering effort. Unfortunately season 2 was done by HTV and looking at the screenshots and reading the reviews, the remastering effort, especially the planets are not of the same quality and do not meet the same high standard as those done by CBS Digital on season 1. Also excessive grain reduction has been applied to certain live action shots. Fortunately CBS Digital are remastering season 3 and HTV are having no further involvement with the remastering confirming their subpar effort. Sadly the damage has been done and unless CBS Digital go back and remaster season 2 then this subpar effort has permanently tarnished season 2. I have cancelled my preorder of season 2 which I was really looking forward to because I will not reward mediocrity and await season 3. I hope CBS Digital change their decision to outsource the even numbered seasons and remaster all remaining seasons in-house.

After watching the fantastic new trailer for the remastered Season 3, its even more obvious what a substandard effort was performed by HTV on this remastering.

-----------------------------------------------------

TNG season 2 is where the show really begins, even if half of season 1 remains remarkably watchable.

Cast additions are made, existing cast roles are refined and honed, and the season takes on a darker tone.  ""Contagion"" deals with computer viruses (a new concept at the time), ""Q Who"" has the Borg, ""Time Squared"" deals with seeing a dire future and trying to prevent it, ""The Icarus Factor"" has Riker meeting up with his estranged father, ""Loud as a Whisper"" deals with a unique situation involving a mediator's assassination, all instantly come to mind.

Season 2 is still varied in terms of episode tone and quality, but the producers did look at what went right in season 1.  All remaining hurdles would be dealt with by season 3, which is pretty much revered as TNG's finest and for all the right reasons...

I'd love to give this 5 stars, especially as season 2's stronger episodes are fantastic entries into the canon.  But there are some problems, which have been discussed, and should be made known as caveats...

A couple professional reviews, and a surfeit of information and visual samples from the site known as ""Trekcore"" has prompted me to post early.  I will update this review as, despite the cost of $64.99, I will splurge.  At which point I will give individual grades for each episode.  I'm hoping the actual discs fare better than what has been put on display so far...

The remastering of season 2 was handed out to an outside agency by CBS.  And the results reported by Blu-Ray reviewers so far?

PROS:
------

* fantastic sharpness and detail for many scenes

* fantastic color gamut for live action footage (from the pics I'd seen, which were numerous, but as the whole of the series was shot on over 25000 reels of film, averaging to be 3571 per season (maybe 3000 for season 2), I suspect some of the cons will be apparent in the live action footage as well as the ""remastered"" f/x work:

* a matte painting for ""Q Who"" for the zoom-out scene had to be re-created.  The original matte, a painting, still exists, but brush strokes would have been visible.  The new version blends slightly better and has a more detail.  The only nitpick is that, on the lower right, the same Borg model was used for two decks, despite surrounding alcoves on each deck being populated or empty.  Spot this nitpick in the screencap but a still image is more revealing than motion video.  All in all, it is FAR better than the original matte insert.

* a close-up of the Enterprise, in CGI, for ""Where Silence Has Lease"" looks more accurate than the midrange shot of the off-color Enterprise in ""Hide and Q"".

* in the same story, Nagillum's recompositing looks authentic to the original.  At least as a screencap - the actual scene might be a tad different (e.g. shimmering effects).

CONS:
------
* poor shadow detail (uneven blacks, especially for recomposited f/x work - outer space is not supposed to be dark gray, with ship details being darker than outer space) - some of these bits take a moment to spot, but once you see it you're not going to get around it

* excessive noise and grain reduction, leading to a plastic look for the characters and a general blurry look.  DO NOTE:  Some scenes' softness (e.g. some from ""The Child"") are due to the pan and scan techniques used at the time (camera equipment), but if the camera is not moving and the image is soft and lacking detail, that's a giveaway that excessive DNR was used.  It depends on the scene in question...

* inaccurate screen ratio: the aspect ratio is 1.35:1 and some scenes, including the Enterprise, disappear off the edge of the screen while the planet can be seen farther to the right

* poor compositing - in a couple of scenes, layers were put on backwards (e.g. shadow detail over the Enterprise hull)

* poor color timing - one scene has an overly bright Borg cube, and the Enterprise warp nacelles are a bright turquoise (despite the reflection from the hull being the appropriate blue.)  The bussard collectors are a purplish-red instead of pure red.  Another scene has a shuttlecraft with bright turquoise warp nacelles as well.

* poor f/x - CGI planets are often soft and blurry, and sometimes shadow detail and light sources don't match between elements

UNKNOWNS:
---------
* certain effects, like the morph effect in ""The Dauphin"" had to be redone from scratch.  They may be better than the original or they may fall flat.

Now it's true, some of the original footage used a poor quality 2' model for the Enterprise and its issues can be seen with perfect clarity now.  That doesn't bug me.

True, the original footage was made on numerous types of film stock - different exposure settings and darker sets show more grain.  That does not bother me.

But there are definite differences between original film source issues and improperly-handled remastering.  I've restored film in the past and these issues of excessive noise reduction, color timing, et al, are visible from a mile away.  Maybe the company was rushing, but their efforts make themselves look bad, and it doesn't reflect well on CBS either.

Do note, CBS did remaster season 1, with spectacular results, and the work CBS has done on season 3 so far shows their efforts being top-notch.  So season 3 is going to be a big WIN.  Season 4 has been handed out to another agency, however.  May season 4 have better results than the poor handling of season 2.  If you're a fan of season 2 like me, be prepared for a shock.

UPDATE 001: (12/04/2012)
------------------------

Before popping in the blu-ray, I rewatched ""Q WHO"" and ""Pen Pals"" on the original DVD.  The borg ship was oversaturated in many spots (not the chroma noise present with the ship and stars in outer space, but garish greens, blues, and reds on the borg ship hull).  Many scenes had visible scan line distortion from the original editing process.  I knew that this Blu-Ray would be better in many ways, but given the standards season 1 had set, that was my focal point for this exercise... so, onto the show:

I watched:

""Q Who"" - 5/5 for story, 4/5 for f/x.  All live action film blows away all of the problems one could find in the original SD release.  The lack of scan lines (especially the transporter room scene when they beam off the Enterprise) is refreshing, especially with the far-more-accurate color palette.  While the Borg ship is a massive improvement overall (green and other color tones/glows are subdued and look more natural), there are some angles where the cube was given too much brightness and stands out for the wrong reasons.  One scene had a poorly re-composited Enterprise, but it was fairly brief.  The existing clips of the 2' model with the turquoise nacelles are bothersome, but brief and therefore minor.  Oh, I did like the borg shield effect when the security guard's phaser hit the borg.  The 3D borg interior does not show the defect I found in the released still image with the duplicate model on two levels, and the animation seen during this pullback scene of individual elements really hits a home run.  Kudos to the production team involved! (I refuse to be anything less than objective.  There are times they did a, pardon the pun, stellar job.)

""Pen Pals"" - 4/5 for story, 3/5 for f/x.  Hannah Louise Shearer always brought something new and fresh to TNG, and usually in very good ways, though the ending of this story is what knocks down 1 point - because it wrecks the story's point of noninterference and repercussions in an attempt to be too sentimental.  But it's not unforgivable.  As for the f/x:  Most f/x shots are easy on the eyes.  The main planet for the story IS soft, but not as distracting as I had originally thought.

""The Dauphin"" - 4/5 for story, 4.5/5 for f/x and restoration.  This story proves Wesley is, oh my, a human and not a wonderboy on par with the wonder twins...  Most f/x scenes work, all look nice, and the new morph effect boosts the score.  I loved the original f/x, given the time they were made in, but this is a case of getting the revamp right.  It's not overblown or excessive and feels true.  It's not the same, but it gets a pass.  The scenes with Selaya in the holodeck are sumptuous; the original footage intact.  Some DNR is present, but it wasn't as bad as the screencap I had seen prior to the official release.  The only letdowns are some exterior shots, but it's minor.

""Contagion""-  5/5 for story, 3/5 for f/x.  Another great season 2 storyline has many f/x scenes featuring dark gray outer space instead of, you know, black.  Once again, some DNR is obtrusive, but it's not beyond redemption.  as usual, some exterior shots look a little off with bussard collector and impulse engine color, but it's minor.  And the nice touch of showing the white blip when the probe was launched from Ikonia was top-notch as well.

So far, the season 2 Blu-Ray set DOES look better than many critiques of posted screencaps were suggesting.  Mostly because motion video hides flaws that still photos will otherwise proverbially shriek to the viewer.  One still photo represents 1/24th of a second, after all.

-----
UPDATE 002: (12/06/2012)
------------------------

I rewatched ""Q Who"" to be sure.

One scene between Q and Guinan has its incidental music a tad loud.  Not enough to drown out dialogue, but almost...

And some of Data's dialogue later on in the episode almost seems sped up.  Something about his voice seems slightly off.  I'm still on the fence with this bit, though.

""Time Squared"" - story: 5/5, f/x:  4/5

The Enterprise finds an abandoned shuttle, with another Picard inside, that came mysteriously from the future!  It's a great episode, focusing on Picard and Troi (who gets some halfway decent dialogue.)

Dark typical gray outer space shots aside, kudos to a fairly great job with the original cloud/vortex f/x.

""The Schizoid Man"" - story: 4/5, f/x 2/5:

It's the typical sci-fi trope of putting a soul into a machine, but the dialogue and cast make its presentation very engaging.

As for the f/x, it's pretty much standard fare.  Keep in mind that f/x is more than just the model work, it includes anything superimposed.  Every episode often had multi-pass shots to mask out background details, including bluescreen glow...  But for one scene, the viewscreen has a blue glow in the upper-right corner.  This is due to one of the scene mask elements not being applied in the remastering.  A season 2 promo also had a blue viewscreen glow (for a different episode, which I did not yet find on the released set.)

As usual, outer space is shown in varying shades of grays or black, defying the top-notch standard season 1 gave.

The same episode has the Enterprise saucer cutting off at the right end of the screen, with the un-distinct blue planet still trailing through (CGI was framed at 1.35:1 and the model was framed at 1.33:1.  It's fairly unobtrusive, but it should not be there. Blu-Ray has various expectations, and never mind that - on a professional level - any number of college grads could do better than this.  The same scene also reveals the (2' model) Enterprise looking somewhat squished (a random problem according to other viewers, caused during the remastering process).

But color timing and framing issues should be the easiest to spot.  Even the uneven outer space grays could have been more easily overlooked, but CBS and zillions of other entities that restore films for professional releases have done this sort of thing right, and consistently...

""Unnatural Selection"" - story: 3/5, f/x: 2/5

It's a half-remake of ""The Deadly Years"" (TOS).  Some love the episode, some hate it.

As for the f/x, the green planet is just a blob, though the green shadow on the Enterprise is nice.  Unfortunately, shadows are a bit off (but could this be due to the original filming?).  But when the shuttle returns to the Enterprise, its  nacelles are bright turquoise.  This color doesn't stand out when the shuttle reaches the planet as badly, but come on - the glow is entirely wrong.  The color timing is off.  And, as usual, outer space is shown in varying shades of gray.

One of the beauty passes for the Enterprise's deflector dish was a slightly greenish-blue... it's subtle, but the deflector glow has historically been the same color, so it is noticeable, and one of the extras did show the deflector having its own separate film pass, so - for this instance - the color timing was off.

The Lantry's shuttle bays had a slight teal tinge to them as well...

(FINAL) UPDATE 003: (12/07/2012)
--------------------------------

""Where Silence Has Lease"" - f/x:  3.5/5

The CGI probe isn't worse than the original 1988 work...

The effort put into Nagillum's editing is fantastic.

As always, inconsistent outer space (from black in one scene to gray in another are prevalent.)  There is some bluescreen bleed in many viewscreen scenes early on, and it's amazing that only this one episode would be replete with those instances.

One scene, with the self destruct being programmed, has the background music a tad low...

""Elementary, Dear Data"" - f/x:  3/5.

As usual, the inconsistency of outer space annoys, as is the use of teal in the deflector dish, instead of the original blue, in an opening shot.  But I'm increasingly used to these issues...

It's a great story, though, and picture quality - as with most episodes' live action footage - is sharp.

""Peak Performance"" - f/x:  0/5

The Hathaway, when first seen, had a distinctly different color (too warm a shade), and a later scene shows it being a different shade (the correct shade).

Many viewscreen shots of Picard talking to Riker have the inserted footage having too little contrast and look somewhat faded and lacking the same color vibrance.  The inconsistency doesn't get much more obvious with these scenes.

As for the outer space bits, let's rename this episode to something it deserves to be called:  Try ""Teal Performance"" instead; so many scenes had every nacelle, deflector, etc, from both Enterprise and Hathaway, being a defiant teal hue -- as a result, a great story ends up annoying to look at due to the poor quality of these ships' details.  Yes, teal/orange is a pretty combination and especially for explosions, but it's not the correct combination.

As the days go by, more criticisms of this season 2 Blu-Ray set have become available to read.

There are a sheer number of consistency issues that - long term - will make season 2 stand out poorly, and they are not limited to the episodes I've outlined in my review here.  The color timing, overly-bright outer space, the Enterprise model stretched/squished in various scenes, the Enterprise vanishing off the screen edge when they shouldn't, stuttering space while the ship is moving, stuttering explosion, etc...  TNG was given some great time for filming in the 1980s, and edited on videotape for financial reasons.  They took the time to film some great visuals back then, so fans of the show (and general viewers) should see a similar amount of effort made in this restoration.

Some have said some episodes look better than others because of fan-regarded status.  Is that really a fair reason?  Name one episode from season 1 and tell me it was given sub-par time and effort because it wasn't well-received by fans?  Which could be any one of 26 episodes, since most people state season 1 is weak and full of poorly written stories.  Yet it received consistently applied, professional treatment.)

Another point of view:  Let's say you dislike season 2; if you heard that one of your favorite shows was going to be restored and released, would you want uneven, inconsistent, and sloppy treatment applied to it?  I doubt it.

This set is still - by no means - a consistently professional effort, given the high-profile nature of this series AND for all of the work being done to make it HD in the first place.

Could the picture quality be better and more consistent?  Absolutely!  But does the DVD original excel in any scene compared to the Blu-Ray?  Not really, apart from color timing for the f/x shots.

What excels in this set, by and large, are the extras, and for the overall quality of the live action footage.  The latter is inconsistent at times, but most of those issues are due to source material (grain) and not the remastering process.  90+% of the season is comprised by live action footage and I've virtually no complaints for those.

But the f/x shots were definitely not paid attention to.  Maybe if the agency had more time to properly do the remastering, CBS is keen on having the entire show out by 2014 (rather than the original 2015 timeframe).  But I'd rather see these releases come out right; imposed timeframes for delivery, when the delivery consists of so many problems, doesn't help anyone in the end.  This isn't a marathon, and cutting corners to win doesn't make it much of a victory.

As a result, I would probably rent this season and then purchase afterward if the material met my qualifiers, but do rent and judge for yourself.",1354406400,99,17181,4.752706359945873
1686586,5,B000062XFG,"Last night I went to the Star Trek: The Next Generation movie theater event organized by Fathom Events to celebrate the release of Season Two on Blu-Ray.  I got to see both ""Q Who?"" and the never before seen extended version of ""The Measure of A Man"" in all their restored glory!  Excerpts from the cast reunion interview and gag reel were shown too.

I am writing to say that having this unique version of ""The Measure of A Man"" is reason enough to buy this very special Season Two release.  You will get to watch this even more fully realized exploration of how we humans treat other life forms - including those we aren't sure are fully ""alive"".  It was always a brilliant episode.. and is even more powerful with these extra 12 or so minutes of dialogue.  It's amazing for me to think of how powerful an episode of Star Trek can be without there being any significant special effects to speak of.  It's all in the writing and the acting!

Bu the way, we who were lucky enough to attend last night's event at the Century City AMC theater in L.A. had the extra special treat of having Melinda Snodgrass (who wrote ""The Measure of a Man""), Michael and Denice Okuda, and several other people connected with the show (including Dan Curry, the man who did the special effects originally and supervised their element-by-elemet transfer to Blu-Ray) there in the audience with us!  They introduced themselves to the audience at the beginning of the evening too, and Melinda told us she originally had the only copy of the extended version of ""The Measure of a Man,"" because a VHS tape of that version was given to her after the show was edited to a length that would fit in allowable TV running time.  Thankfully, she kept that all these years.  It was used to make the version we got to see last night.

Both episodes looked amazing in full high-def, so I'm sure Season Two will look great when we watch it at home.  But I must re-emphasize the value of getting this extended version of ""The Measure of a Man"".",1354233600,25,2006,4.478021978021978

The story is well written with only a few suspensions of belief (outside the normal sci-fi-esque elements). The acting is quite good with Data and La Forge improving and starting to own their roles. The director allowed the story to unfold without resorting to gimmicks or the normal pitfalls which plagued season 1.

Considering this was only the second season of the show, some of the graphics and action sequences may seem a little dated. However, this is a story-driven episode that reveals much about Worf. Some spoilers follow.

For starters, the Enterprise is dispatched on a secret mission (this alone annoys Picard). They pick up an emissary, who is not only half Klingon, and half Human, but also a former lover of Worf's. This emissary and Worf are tasked to work together by Picard. Worf tries to get out of this assignment in an exchange with Picard that is prices (Picard gives a silent stare that says all that Worf needs to know). Michael Dorn's portrayal of Worf clearly exemplifies one of many reasons why this series was so amazing, but also the casting genius that brought this show together.

Among the themes explored are social concepts, as evidenced by Worf's strong adherence to Klingon ideals, as well as the Klingon battle cruiser's crew. The idea of falling in love versus having a lover is also explored. But of course, getting to know Worf through this episode was a real delight.

1686599,2,B000062XFG,"I really loved this show in the '80s and '90s. Now that I've seen Voyager and esp. DS9, I like this show.

In spite of that, this was a stinker of an episode. The writers can (have done, and will) do better. The actors are all talented, but not given much to go on here.

Why wasn't Troi called to the bridge when in contact with an alien species for the first time? Why would Riker just allow Geordi to go to their vessel with what seems like little thought? How important was this little sightseeing mission of theirs that Picard and Wesley would spend 6 hours in a shuttlecraft as opposed to the Enterprise getting them there in, what, minutes?
And how many specialties can one doctor have, for crying out loud? In ""Unnatural Selection"" Pulaski's lauded as the first mind in virology and immunology, and now we're supposed to believe she's a better choice than the docs who've done this procedure hundreds of times?? And they've never run into (or thought of considering the possibility of) ""heterocyclic declination""? *facepalm*

The only part of this episode I found bearable was the interchange between Picard and Wesley on the shuttlecraft. The whole ""look to the past; nothing's better than history and philosophy"" stuff was okay, but the personal talk of the captain's youthful indiscretions was better. Both actors carried it off with aplomb.

The Pakleds were without dignity, interest, and apparently grammatical constructs like verb tenses thanks to the writers. I cannot imagine the Romulans handing over technology because they didn't want a single crewmember lost...they just don't seem that warmhearted to me.
One has to be able to go along for the ride in sci-fi type shows. I just wish the writers had given us more than a mule for transportation in this ep.",1335744000,,1777,4.81639344262295

I'd relly love to get your feedback on Pulaski, though. I suppose this question would be better asked at the end of the season, but I'm guessing most of you are not first time viewers.
I enjoy Dr. Pulaski for two reasons. Primarily, she reminds me of McCoy in many ways. She's old fashioned, opinionated, and argumentative with her captain. Even her speech patterns remind me of McCoy, whom I adored.
Secondarily, I a was never a big fan of Dr. Crusher. I certainly don't dislike either the character or Gates McFadden. Just not wild about her.

Finally, I would say that while the acting and stories were generally of improving quality, there were some points where the premise of a scene was a bit preposterous. I thought the episode where Data was on trial to determine his status as a person and the show where aliens who are not that bright kidnap Geordi seemed especially hard to believe even in the Star Trek setting.

And though there may still have been a few episodes that didn't quite cut the mustard (""The Outrageous Okona"" and ""Pen Pals,"" for example), the scripts here were a decided improvement over those for Season One. The look of the series was also improving - the sets and camerawork seem more polished, and though the costuming for the leads remains essentially the same, at least this time around Riker is wearing his beard (which may seem like a strange and superficial thing to cite as an improvement, but there ya' go). True, viewers briefly got stuck with Dr. Pulaski instead of Dr. Crusher, but I think the ultimate mismanagement of this character had less to do with actress Diana Muldaur's ability than it did with the writers' apparent desire to recreate Doctor McCoy in female form.

1686615,4,B000062XFG,"Last Christmas, lacking even a single episode of the show on DVD, I asked for NextGen's complete third season as a gift. Not only was it markedly better than the previous two, it was my favorite of the whole series, and the first to really flex its muscles and demonstrate what the writers, actors, and even the set-designers could really do. It was, in short, the season that I thought of whenever NextGen came to mind; it seemed to encapsulate what was best about the show. So you can imagine my disappointment when I looked under the tree and saw...the first two seasons instead.

I was not a huge fan of said seasons. In fact, in my review of Season One I accused the other reviewers of ""grading it on a curve"" with all those five-star reviews - ranking it not for what it was but what it eventually became. I took some abuse for this, but I didn't really regret saying it. Season One certainly has its moments, but on the whole it's awkward, silly and even - gasp! - kinda cheesy. And in fact Season Two has its share of that awkwardness, silliness and cheeseiness...but a lot less than I remembered. Though it was still clearly working out kinks and bugs endemic to all new shows, there is a lot here that works. But this was not readily apparent when I began watching.

What I first noticed was that Riker had a beard, Gates McFadden's Dr. Beverly Crusher had been replaced by Diana Muldaur's Dr. Kate Pulaski, Worf was no longer wearing that crappy-looking 1969 era Klingon sash, several of the crewmembers had switched uniform colors, Whoopi Goldberg was tending bar, and Troi had much better hair. However, the first four episodes (""The Child"", ""Contagion"", ""The Dauphin"" and ""Elementary, Dear Data"") were unimpressive. Not bad, just blah. They seemed to lack dramatic tension or any sense of pacing; instead of a story arc, things just happened, without urgency or plan, until the credits rolled. What's more, the ridiculous ""Holodeck almost destroying the ship"" plot device was still lurking about; that was nearly as aggravating as ""Wesley's science project almost destroys the ship"" maguffin. What's more, the annoying tendency of the writers to Bogart ""Classic Trek"" plots and then have the crew pretend as if ""nothing like this has ever happened before"" is still fully in place. ""Where Silence Has Lease"" rips off ""The Immunity Syndrome"" so thoroughly for the first 20 or so minutes it looks like a remake - there is even some dialogue repeated verbatim, yet the ""hole in space"" is still presented as a brand-new phenomenon. And Troi? Still stuck with stating the pathetically obvious. Okona is a mischievous rouge? Really? Didja figure that out before or after he shagged a 20something Teri Hatcher?

Luckily things improved rather quickly. ""The Emissary"" continued the tradition, set in Season One, of the Klingon-based storylines being among the most interesting of the series. ""The Icarus Factor"", despite the ""anbojitsu"" silliness, gave Johnathan Frankes something heavy to deal with and fleshed out what had been a pretty superficial character. ""Loud as a Whisper"" was a very innovate story idea. ""Pen Pals"" presented a wicked moral dilemma and had some terrific sequences between Frakes and Patrick Stewart. ""Manhunt"", while ridiculous, was undeniably funny - Picard's discomfiture with Lawaxanna Troi is painfully entertaining.  My favorites, however, were as follows:

""A Matter of Honor"" was an instant classic. Having Riker serve as first mate on a Klingon ship was a terrific idea, one which allowed the writers to begin exploring Klingon culture, something they continued to do brilliantly throughout the rest of the series. The sub-plot involving the obnoxious Mordak (sp?) was also funny.

 ""Q Who?"" was without a doubt a terrific episode, not merely because it introduced the Borg, but because its brutality, relentless pace and unexpected ending (Picard admitting to inadequacy!) made it stand out even among the best NextGen stories. The slowly-building sense of dread, the feeling that Starfleet has finally bitten off more that it can ever chew, is really remarkable. Special kudos to John De Lancie, who played Q with unusual nastness and menace.

The most evolved piece of work from the season, if not the most exciting, was probably ""The Measure of a Man."" The performances, particularly of Stewart and Brent Spiner, were excellent. Instead of delivering a boilerplate coutroom drama in space, they tackled complex legal, moral and philosophical issues which, let's face it, are at the heart of what ""Star Trek"" was all about.

So in the end, I'm very glad I got this as a gift. While I still maintain that the NextGen wasn't fully done baking until Season Three, there is more than enough good stuff here - including a great deal of DVD extras, some of which are very interesting -- to justify paying the extortionate price.",1303430400,,4864,4.950980392156863

1686618,4,B000062XFG,"Who doesn't like Star Trek TNG. Any Sci-fi fan loves the series as much as they love the other great sci-fi series. This item is the complete second season DVD set. It contains all the episodes plus some extras on the last disk such as development, episode ideas, cast comments, and many other things.

The complete second series dvd box is compact and tight, fitting in any DVD case with similiar products. I did
have a slight problem with the layout of the second season box. Its a dual foldout box, strangely designed and not
that sturdy. It holds the dvd's in with the basic plastic center plug (its not a sleave box) and they are tight and secure. The design of the dual foldout box makes simply picking a episode dvd annoying. Instead of just opening the
box and picking your dvd, you have to unfold it all the way first then pick it, then fold it back. Bad design.

But overall who cares about the box. The episodes are great, the show is great, and the quality of the episodes were great.

As a last note, when you want to buy the seasons or complete seasons of Star Trek TNG, make sure to do your homework with pricing. Many times the individual seasons are cheaper than the complete set, and sometimes they are not. When I purchaced the individual seasons seperately they were 35 dollars each, about 100 dollars cheaper than
buying the complete boxed set. And I see currently the individual seasons are 50 dollars each. So watch your prices and buy smart.",1281225600,,1465,4.5
1686619,5,B000062XFG,"Season 2 is one enjoyable season of shows.  When TNG started I wasn't sure I would like it.  Picard is no Captain Kirk.  And I thought there would never be another relationship such as the one between Spock and McCoy. But I grew to love TNG, as much as, if not more than TOS.  And this season has some dramatic shows as well as some funny episodes.  Up the Long Ladder is one of my favorite humorus episodes.  The episode where Data and Geordi visit the holodeck as Holmes and Watson is both funny and dramatic.  The temporary addition of Dr. Pulaski to replace Dr. Crushers character was hard to get used to.  Pulaski doesn't have the warm, friendly disposition that Crusher does.  But she grew on me a little as the season progressed.  I would definitely recommend getting this season.  I think the actors were defining their characters in season 1.

1686622,2,B000062XFG,"Season 1 of this show was a travesty.  They took everything that was wrong with the original series and made a season of television based on that.  This season was only slightly better (some people would even say that this season is the worst).  Beverly Crusher is absent this season, and she is replaced with Dr. Pulaski, that annoying raspy-voiced harpy.  Her character alone was enough to bring the season down.  And she seems to have a pathological hatred for Data, demeaning him at every opportunity.

They start the season off with a Troi epsiode, which almost could have been percieved as a sign that is was going to be a bad season.  A thing about Troi inexplicably having a child, who grows to boyhood in a matter of days.  Then they followed it up with an episode about some wierd organism thing doing experiments on Enterprise and her crew.  Then the stupid Sherlock Holmes episode, which later led to the absolutely horrible ""Ship in a Bottle"" episode a few years later.  Then the absolutely horrible, awful, terrible ""The Outrageous Okona"".  Probably my least favorite episode of the entire series.  And I'm talking worse than ""Hide and Q"" or ""Code of Honor.""  It's simply too painful for me to go into much of these episodes in detail.  There were some good ones, such as ""A Matter of Honor"", in which Riker has to serve aboard a Klingon ship as part of an officer exchange program.  It established the Klingons of TNG, and was a pretty decent episode.  The episode immediately following, ""The Measure of a Man, is widely considered to be one of the best of the entire series.  Picard has to hold a hearing to determine whether Data is a sentient being, and if he has the right to refuse to be dismantled for research purposes.  Riker is forced to prosecute, which makes it even harder for Picard to win the case.  This episode was great, and it was very dramatic, even though there wasn't a single action scene.

Wow.  I'm already done.  That was a quick review.  As I said in my season 1 review, I am astonished that this series did not get cancelled in the first season.  It took until the third season to change into the great series that it would eventually be.  There is no way this show could have gotten good ratings in the beginning.  It was just so bad.  This season is a little bit better.  We are introduced to the Borg, possibly the scariest villians of Trek.  At least until they introduce the Borg Queen.  Then they became a joke.  To wrap up, this was a pretty bad season of Star Trek.  Once again, it tried to be too much like the original series, minus the beloved characters from that show.",1271376000,2,2623,4.514893617021277

1686626,5,B000062XFG,"""Captain Picard, I cannot allow you to leave.  Before we can go forward, the cycle must end.""

-- Picard, while shooting and killing his future self, ""Time Squared""

The first minute of the first episode of this season lays it all out for you.  We get far more advanced model and computer animation (ship exteriors), a first glimpse at the shuttle bay and a shuttle craft, a better lit and color adjusted bridge, and some sophisticated camera work, all set to a brilliant new score (not to be confused with the title theme).  All in all, it seems clear that the producers have taken fan input into account and have done everything possible to deliver a superior product for season two.

As the episode and season continue, we discover a slew of new surprises.  For one thing, the boundaries of the ship truly expand with not only the addition of the shuttlebay, but also the introduction of Ten Forward, the social center of the ship in which we get to see more of our favorite characters off duty.  Guinan, ably played by Whoopie Goldberg, manages to pull the best from each character when the main action of the plot doesn't allow them to reveal their inner selves otherwise.  Furthermore, Season Two makes far better use of the holodeck, establishing its parameters and functions more clearly, but also presenting some of the best holodeck-oriented concepts, moments, and full-blown episodes of the series.

Another nice surprise is the tweaks (both subtle and not so subtle) made to the cast.  Worf and Troi both receive necessary make-overs.  Wes ditches the rainbow racing stripe across the chest and matures into a relatively likeable and rarely annoying young cadet.  Geordi finally earns legitimate placement amongst the main cast by becoming Chief Engineer.  Picard drops much of the grouchy facade he bore in season one, establishing genuine rapport with much of the cast (especially Ryker).  Finally, Dr. Pulaski replaces Dr. Crusher as the ship's doctor.  While, in many ways, Pulaski is a clear and tired rip-off of Dr. McCoy from the original series, she challenges and pulls much from the crew whereas Dr. Crusher felt relatively isolated and uninteresting amongst the cast in season one (this changes when she returns in season three).

Beyond these changes, both subtle and blatant, occurring in the background of each episode, what strikes me the most about season two is the writing.  Nearly every episode in this season brings out all the grand science fiction adventure of the original series while applying the statesman-like discourse on ethics to each adventure that later becomes Next Gen's hallmark.

Some highlights from this season include:

""A Matter of Honor,"" in which Ryker serves on a Klingon vessel, introduces us to Klingon culture, and confronts the double-edged sword of culture shock while providing a fantastically entertaining storyline in the process.

""The Measure of a Man,"" in which Data's sentience is determined in a riveting courtroom trial with Picard as the defendant and Ryker as the prosecutor.

""Contagion,"" in which the Enterprise discovers highly imaginative and eerily advanced technology from a long-dead civilization and must decide how to keep it from the Romulans.

""The Royal,"" a highly whimsical yet disturbing episode in which Ryker, Data, and Worf are trapped in an early twentieth century casino which serves as reparation for a man who has been dead for hundreds of years.

""Time Squared,"" TNG's first great time loop story in which the crew discovers and must deal with the existential problems of an unconscious Picard from six hours in the future who fled the Enterprise shortly before it was destroyed.

""Q Who"": the return of Q, the continuation of his assessment of the human race, and the terrifying first appearance of the Borg.

""Manhunt"": Luwaxana Troi at her comic best as she tries to snare Picard as a husband.

Honestly, though, the only disappointing episode of this season is ""Shades of Gray,"" the final episode which was strung together on the threshold of a writer's strike.  It's a clip show before TNG had enough worthwhile clips to warrant such an undertaking.

All in all, TNG season two is a fantastic experience and a personal favorite season of mine.  It's still a long way from achieving all the greatness that can be found in later seasons, but there's so much here to love.  It's absolutely worth the time and money to discover this season and then revisit it, again and again.",1238198400,,4471,4.969086021505376

1686628,3,B000062XFG,"Short and sweet. The case is fair quality, with a fold out for 7 DVDs. The menu system is a bit funky. I am collecting serveral TV Series, and would prefer that these have the ""Play All"" feature similar to the later years M.A.S.H. DVDs.

The second season starts out a badly disjointed story line that never made any sense as to why Dr. Beverly Crusher was no longer aboard the Enterprise, but her Juvenile Son Wesley remained on board. Dr Crusher was replaced for this season only by Dr. Kate Polasky played by Diana Muldaur. An entirely fine character, played by a perfectly good actress, that just feels terribly out of place.

The screenwriting and special effects in this season are maturing, as are the characters somewhat. We find Geordi LaForge promoted to the title of Chief Engineer, and the appearance of Whoopi Goldberg's character Guinan.

As a collector, and enthusiast in all things Trek this is a must have box set. But don't expect it to be the same quality writing, acting, effects, or characters as later seasons. But it is obvious they were getting their act together here.",1236643200,,1093,4.712041884816754

1686635,3,B000062XFG,"On balance, the second season of TNG was a big step forward.  Everything about TNG, especially the acting and writing, had improved greatly over the show's first year. At the same time, the writers hadn't quite figured out how to consistently write good, much less great, episodes.

Whereas most of the main characters were, at best, rough sketches in the 1st season, most of them finish the second season quite similar to what they would be in the rest of the series.  Only Worf would have a substantial way to go.  In addition, three new characters are introduced -- Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur).  While Muldaur's character was never on the show long enough to fully adapt, and in general I prefer Gates McFadden, she definitely improved and was not the disaster that some fans suggest.

This season is definitely highlighted by ""The Measure of a Man"" (a series classic by any measure) and ""Q Who"" (which introduces the fan-favorite villain Borg), as well as the underrated ""Time Squared"".  There are also a handful of other very good episodes.  The rest of the season is generally unremarkable, generally better than season 1 but weaker than later seasons.  Special criticism should be reserved for the awful ""Shades of Grey"", but it's worth noting that this exceptionally bad episode is not representative of the season as a whole.

Overall, everybody but hardcore fans could skip owning this season - though the better episodes are definitely worth watching.",1215216000,,1520,4.996031746031746

1686637,3,B000062XFG,"I love Star Trek OK? That being said, this is the season where Next Gen really took off, starting with The Child, Contagion, the profound Measure of A Man, and culminating with Elementary Dear Data, the monumental Q Who?, and the exciting Peak Performance. Excellent writing almost across the board, excellent acting and superb chemistry between the actors. Can't beat it for Television. And they did all this for a mere 1.5 million per episode. Realize that this is upwards of 267 Million dollars for the Next Gen franchise. That is a huge investment, and in that context, 62.00$ is not too bad for 19 hours of enjoyment!

The one issue I have is Paramount's DVD quality control. If you order a set, FIRST THING YOU DO AFTER YOU UNPACK THIS YEAR'S SET IS INSPECT THE UNDERSIDE OF EACH DISK FOR SCRATCHES OR DEFECTS!! A must! One small flaw and you get skips, or freezes. Major scratches and your disk will come to a grinding halt and will lock up. Usually at the worst possible time, at a critical moment in your favorite show. For this kind of money, you don't need that. Now for the good stuff...

In my collection, you will find Season Three, Season Four, and Season Two, the best, most consistent quality oriented, thoughtful scripts, screenplays and compelling acting in my opinion, however, I had to go through multiple sets of Year 2 because there was at least one major flaw (I mean big ones) on the underbelly (laser burned side) of at least one disk in every set of Year 2 I owned.

Year two premiered the development of Riker's great Sir Walter Raleigh beard, and the debut of Ten Forward, THE place to go to blow off steam or just relax and be human, and have fun. While I thought a few of the first year's shows were indicative of potential, Year Two was when that potential began to be tapped. In Season Two, Troi's accent was not quite so pretentious, Riker became more of a real, vibrant, Machiavellian character, with a great humour, quick wit, and less of a stiff cartoon character. Picard really found his voice, and Beverly took off a year (and thereby, somehow, became a great actress) while she was away having her baby. Worf became a more handsome and believable Klingon, and everything just moved ahead by leaps and bounds. Dr. Pulaski was great in Elementary Dear Data and she sparkled in Peak Performance. This was just great fun, with some powerful philosophy thrown in for good measure, in typical Star Trekian fashion. Top quality entertainment.

Next Gen. really took off in year two. You might notice three or more decibels of additional bridge and engineering sub-bass and engine noise in year two's shows. Your higher powered subwoofer will confirm this. This also added to the moxy and the gravitas of the second (and subsequent) seasons, and added together, they spelled success in capital letters! No other Trek show had this unique idea.

Next Gen was destined for a big splash, and year two, the Second Season, was when it really began to coalesce. The crew became THE Crew. This season cemented the chemistry that made all seven years of Next Gen possible.

No Trek collection would be complete without The Second Season of Next Gen.

I have nothing against Dr. Crusher, but I do like Dr. Pulaski much better.  Another thing in its favour is the character developments in the second season.  I like getting to know the characters better and seeing what they do with their lives, rather than just the wonders the ship has to offer.

1686652,4,B000062XFG,"Like the first season, the second round of Star Trek: The Next Generation is short of fantastic. There's still a healthy dose of cheese interspersed with the good stuff, but right from the get-go it's clear that there has been a significant improvement. Also notable about season 2 is the fact that the writers went on strike toward the beginning of the season, causing old scripts for a cancelled 70s Trek show to be unearthed and filmed.

The greatness here is truly great, however. Season 2 contains the single best episode of the series, The Measure of a Man. This is a bold episode in every sense - it takes on massive ideas (no less than the very meaning of life) and comes out pretty well. It also sparkles with witty writing and a thrilling courtroom scene. All told, this is the best of what Trek does best. The flops are also spectacular, like The Outrageous Okona, an episode about humor that isn't even remotely funny. This is Trek at its most shrill and stuffy, and should be avoided at almost any cost. Also pathetic is Shades of Gray, a clip show. Consider how weak clip shows are even in fluffy sitcoms that have run for years, and you get the idea about how lame this one is.

The characters have developed into good niches, however. Data takes an especially cool arc this season, as he learns that there's more to poker than just the odds. No longer is he the most demonstrative emotionless robot ever made. Riker also evolves from Picard Jr. into TNG's answer to Captain Kirk from the original show. Dr. Crusher is also replaced for this season with Dr. Pulaski, a McCoy type. Worf is no longer an idiotic berserker, but a fully developed and far more interesting character.

Highlight episodes include Where Silence Has Lease, a brain-bender featuring a great climactic gambit by Picard. The aforementioned The Measure of a Man is also stunning, as mentioned before. Contagion is suspenseful and action-heavy, Time Squared is a good thriller, Q Who introduces the show's most feared villains, and Peak Performance offers an exciting duel of wits between Picard and Riker, punctuated by a real crisis.

All told, Season 2 does everything bigger (but not always better) than Season 1. It is relatively disposable, but some of its best episodes are as good as they come. The next season will truly inaugurate the golden period of The Next Generation. Recommended for completists.",1153699200,4,2396,4.766265060240964
1686653,5,B000062XFG,I'm always a sucker for Star Trek.  Season 2 has some memorable episodes as the cast begins to come into its' own.,1153526400,,114,4.181818181818182
1686654,5,B000062XFG,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Two was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Season Two, still carries on with repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time, bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a beard),  Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space' feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice, shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive, kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data' where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He better ""make it so"" with Season Three.",1144627200,20,6204,4.797196261682243
1686655,5,B000062XFG,"The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...

$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)

Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.

Don't get me wrong, the entire series IS fun and seasons 1 and 2 have their appreciable values as well; season 1 boasting a wealth of good ideas that just had an awkward production feel to them:

The Child:  Resurrected from an aborted Kirk series of the late-70s, this one is competent in all ways.  Nice talk re: abortion too.  Pulaski makes a great intro and despite being lambasted as a McCoy ripoff (for which the TNG spinoffs never get too many of), Pulaski was a great replacement for Crusher.

Where Silence Has Lease:  Half trite, but the creepiness/horror factor kept it interesting.  All in all underrated.

Elementary, Dear Data:  Ah!  The stuff that REAL sci-fi is made out of.  A+++  Daniel Davis as Holmes is inspired casting to boot.

The Outrageous Okona:  Rejected Season 1 script?  best left ignored...

Loud as a Whisper:  An interesting take on mediation; things naturally go awry. of course...

The Schizoid Man:  Not the best, but very underrated and the creepy factor is also well done.

Unnatural Selection:  Ripoff of every ""let's age 'em quickly"" plot ever made.  Pulaski is fun to watch, but that's about it...

A Matteer of Honor:  Great Klingon story.  A bit pedestrian in its presentation (a frequent season 1 complaint), but I love it to pieces anyway.

The Measure of a Man:  The first and by far BEST story regarding Data's status as a sentient being.

The Dauphin:  Bland entry.

Contagion:  Another AWESOME story.  Great use of ideas and is the first ""computer virus"" story.  Nice solution too.

The Royale:  Don't bother.  It's filler.

Time Squared:  Yowza.  Another story that goes where nobody has gone before; the first and best story regarding being caught in a time loop...

The Icarus Factor:  I never cared for this type of story.  Too soapy.  Nice set pieces, but not ideal as a whole story.

Pen Pals:  Lovely in thought, but breaks Federation rules all over the place.  Not to mention Data being grossly out of character.

Q Who?:  Q is reminiscent of the 7th Doctor as he meddles with Picard and introduced them to the Cyber... whoops, the Borg.  Don't get my sarky comments wrong, this story is well defined, well acted, and is a total CLASSIC.  I could care less about the ""Borg Nursery"", but it's logical they'd have one...

Samaritan Snare:  A bizarre story, and watchable in its own mind, it is a bit disconcerting to watch...

Up the Long Ladder:  Nice comedy piece that turns to horror as two branches of the same race ultimately have to learn to live together; one similar to 1800s Earth, the other that bleached its gene pool thanks to excessive cloning.  It is a noble story, but Riker - as usual - gets it on with the alien chick of the week...

Manhunt:  Another comedy piece; it depends if you like Lwaxana or not.

The Emissary:  Worf's background is explored.  So is K'Elhyr.  Pity she gets killed off. :(

Peak Performance:  A clever entry; simulating war games and in come the Ferengi in a performance on par to ""The Battle"".

Shades of Gray:  A clip show?!  Little faith in the series (half-understandable) or behind-the-scenes strike and other issues preventing a proper story from being made?

Season 2 is a big improvement; using directorial styles invented in other series.  But it's as much original as it is derivative thanks to exploring usually decent sci-fi ideas and making them work within the sphere of Trekdom.  Sadly, later series would ditch the cool sci-fi element and make the show drivel-preachy-drama of the week, with the Enteprise-D used (yet again) as a mere cargo ship...",1138406400,4,4142,4.740479548660085
1686656,5,B000062XFG,"Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...

Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...

The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Child"" in which Enterprise crewmember Trois experiences an unexplained pregnancy as the Enterprise rushes to escape from a system wrought with a dangerous plague... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""A Matter of Honor"" in which Riker joins an officer exchange program which places him on a Klingon ship while the Enterprise must learn to deal with its own officer exchange participant, and ""Pen Pals"" in which strange earthquakes and tectonic activity upon the planet where Data's pen pal lives prompts members of the Enterprise to get to the bottom of the mystery...

1686657,4,B000062XFG,"The second season. An improvement over the mostly horrible first season (Troi changed her hairstyle which coincided with a miraculous personality change that made the 7th season Troi a completely different person from the first season, it was the only season with a different doctor, Dr. Pulaski, who was a little bit like a female Dr. McCoy and was a complete failure.

Stardate 42073.1 ""The Child"" Troi becomes pregnant because of an alien that wants to learn what it is like to have a corporeal existance. 2 stars

Stardate 42193.6 ""Where Silence Has Lease"" Huge alien being engulfs Enterprise and tries to kill off 1/3 of the crew in an attempt to learn how humans die.  Picard activates auto-destruct but stops with 2 seconds to spare as being releases them. 2 stars

Stardate 42286.3 ""Elementary, Dear Data"" The introduction of Data's favorite Sherlock Holmes holoprogram.  Of course they get stuck in there, and one of the characters becomes self-awar and tries to take over the ship.  Starts a running theme with Data, and Professor Moriarty becomes a semi-recurring character. 3 stars

Stardate 42402.7 ""The Outrageous Okana"" A roguish freightor captain comes aboard the Enterprise and tries to teach Data about humor.  Another episode wher Wesley saves the day (ugh) but the ending line is good. 3 stars

Stardate 42477.2 ""Loud as a Whisper"" A deaf mediator comes aboard Enterprise. His only way to communicate with others is through a chorus of people who can tranlate his thoughts into words.  When they are killed, he must do the mission without them. 2 stars

Stardate 42437.5 ""The Schizoid Man"" Dying scientist transfer his conciousness into Data, causing some unusually emotional responses on his part, but everything turns out all right in the end ( this is Star Trek after all) 3 stars

Stardate 42494.8 ""Unnatural Selection"" Dr. Pulaski ages quickly, calling mind TOS episode ""The Deadly Years"", which was better. 2 stars

Stardate 42506.5 ""A Matter of Honor"" Riker takes part in a transfer program and is first officer aboard a Klingon ship.  If only the secondary story weren't about Wesley, it would have been great. 3 stars

Stardate 42523.7 ""The Measure of a Man"" An annoying scientist, with the habit of calling Data ""it"" wants to take Data apart and PIacrd must defend his second officer in a battle to decide whether Data is a life-form or not. A great episode. 4 stars

Stardate 42568.8 ""The Dauphin"" Wesley falls for visiting girl who isn't all she appears to be.  Shape-shifters should never have been attempted before DS9. and Wesley should be thrown out of an airlock. 1 star

Stardate 42609.1 ""Contagion"" Enterprise's sister ship explodes mysteriously and Data's programming gets erased. 2 stars

Stardate 42625.4 ""The Royale"" Enteprise crew become trapped in a casino novel where they must play out the parts. Fairly interesting. 2 stars

Stardate 42679.2 ""Time Squared"" Enterprise crew discovers a duplicate Capt. Picard, who tells them that his ship was destroyed and theirs will be too. 4 stars

Stardate 42686.4 ""The Icarus Factor"" It seems to be a requirement for Starfleet that it's officers have bad parental relationships.  Riker's father comes on board, and they haven't spoken for over ten years. 2 stars

Stardate 42685.3 ""Pen Pals"" Data sends messages to a child and tries to save her when her planet is almost destroyed. 2 stars

Stardate 42761.3 ""Q Who"" Q sends the Enterprise across the galaxy, where they have their first encounter with the terrifying Borg. AWESOME! 4 stars

Stardate 42779.1 ""Samaritan Snare"" Geordi is captured by a race a race of rather slow aliens called the Pakleds. Not one of the best. 2 stars

Stardate 42823.2 ""Up the Long Ladder"" Two groups of cloned human colonists need Enterprise's help their planet is destroyed and their races begin to die.  2 stars

Stardate 42859.2 ""Manhunt"" Lwaxana Troi tries to make Picard fall in love with her.  Always a mini-theme between the two of them. 3 stars

Stardate 42901.3 ""The Emissary"" Worf and a former love interest must find a Klingon ship that still thinks the Federation and the Empire are at war and keep the Enterprise from getting destroyed. 3 stars

Stardate 42923.4 ""Peak Performance"" War simulations turn deadly when the Ferengi show up, and Data has to go against an arrogant visitor in a game. 2 stars

Stardate 42976.1 ""Shades of Gray"" Riker looks like he's going to die due to an organism that invaded his brain.  Dr. Pulaski uses his negative emotions to kill it.  Her last appearance. (hooray) 2 stars

1686658,4,B000062XFG,"This is pretty much where I started.  For some reason, I feel like I'm mostly familiar with Season 2 episodes from when I watched Star Trek back in college over ten years ago.  In my memory, a bunch of Season 2 episodes were at the apex of my ""Star Trek"" experience.  This tells you, of course, that I'm really not a Trekkie.  But now that we're watching episodes regularly (thanks to Netflix) we decided to start at this very season (because I do remember some highly cheesy Season 1 episodes as well, so we bypassed that one).

Here's how I (a non-Trekkie) break down this season's episodes:

CLASSICS:

""The Measure Of A Man"" - For a long time, my favorite TNG episode.  The courtroom dialogues is riveting, and the emotions are boiling over because the stakes are high.  Stewart, Frakes, and Spiner are at the top of their game here.  Don't miss it.

""Q Who"" - Ah, my favorite guest star/character.  Q introduces the crew to the Borg.  What a plot.  Picard's last trifecta - imploring Q to rescue them - is masterful.  Whoopi's Guinan is fantastic here.  She's so good you can forget her other roles.

TOP NOTCH:

""Elementary, Dear Data"" - An interesting episode in that really probes Data's limits and introduces us to the character of Moriarty (who somehow becomes self-aware on the holodeck).  May sound hokey, but it's well done.

""Unnatural Selection"" - Actually quite tense.  I didn't see how they'd get out of the plot complications in this one.  Muldaur as Pulaski is quite good - I may even prefer her to Crusher.

""A Matter Of Honor"" - Intriguing watching.  Interesting exploration of culture clash and loyalty.

""Contagion"" - Tense.  It's worth your time.

""The Royale"" - I actually liked this one, although it has its detractors.  The basic idea of the Royale (I won't spoil it) is not much on its own, but I wondered how they'd get out of it.

""Time Squared"" - Very tense, especially as the future Picard they pick up gets closer to the present.  I generally don't like time travel issues, and this one is no exception, but there was enough creepiness (as well as good acting by Stewart) to keep me hooked.

""Pen Pals"" - If only for the Prime Directive discussion.

""The Emissary"" - Valuable Worf development.

OK:

(All the other episodes not listed above or below.  Most of these I could take or leave.)

YUCK!:

""The Child"" - The whole premise - yuck!

""Up The Long Ladder"" - Give me a break.  The whole resolution to the problem is so contrived, it's vomit-inducing.  It's just yucky.  Skip it.

Overall, a great season.  If I recall correctly (and the other reviews are right), it was this season which saw ""Star Trek"" starting to shed some of the holdover cheese and contrivances.  THAT is a good thing.",1112227200,3,2726,4.60125260960334
1686659,4,B000062XFG,"Aside from a few clunkers at the beginning of the season, and one or two others later on in the set, it's amazing how quickly ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" found its feet in its second season, delivering consistently entertaining, mature science fiction entertainment virtually every episode.  The characters are more relaxed together (especially while interacting in the new ""Ten Forward"" bar/lounge set) and there are a minimum of those too-often used boilerplate Trek plots involving superior aliens who think humans are too savage to be in space.  Instead, the aliens are evil for once, as we get to enjoy the introduction of the cold, clinical but no less savage Borg!  The documentary materials are better organized this time out, too.  While we still get a variety of interviews with the cast and crew taken from all over the map (when the shows were in production, years later as they looked back, etc.), this time we're provided with the dates of the interviews and the context in which they were conducted, which really helps to orient the viewer and keeps the materials from becoming a confusing mish-mash.  This boxed set is a great way to catch up on these episodes again, or experience them for the first time if you weren't a fan when they were first broadcast.",1107993600,,1279,4.848623853211009
1686660,4,B000062XFG,"When I wrote that the first season was okay, the second season was much better but still not as good as the show became to be in the third season. They brought in a new doctor, Diana Muldar as Dr. Kate Pulaski. They built a new set, Ten Forward, they introduced the Borg, and Whoopi Goldberg the first major star to appear on TNG as Guinan. Here is some of my favorites in this season.

1686661,3,B000062XFG,"After a so-so shakedown season, Star Trek:Tng season 2 premiered in the autumn of 1988. It was soon apparent that year 2 would not be the best this show would offer. A few episodes such as: WHERE SILENCE HAS LEASE, A MATTER OF HONOR, CONTAIGION,and Q-WHO were actually very good, but the rest of the season was poorly written. Buy these dvds only because they belong in your star trek library but remember the best for this show is still a few seasons away.",1105833600,4,457,4.4523809523809526
1686662,4,B000062XFG,"This season is notable for  a few things not many other reviewers have commented on-- the sole appearance of the wonderful Pakleds, the Dummies of Space, a very refreshing change of pace from the typical ST space menaces/pushovers. To this day, ""He is smart!"" and ""We look for things to make us go"" remain in my vocabulary.  The Pakleds never fail to make me laugh.  Too many trekkies are too uptight to enjoy them, I fear.  Then there is Lycia Naff's delightful Ensign Sonia Gomez, who only appears twice, alas.  Would that there were more episodes with this charmer!  They could have done a lot more with the Ensign Gomez; pity we never saw this.  Her enthusiastic naivete probably annoyed a lot of 'serious"" fans, but I found her charming and the character could have filled the need for an ""everyman/woman"" type on a show mainly revolving around  super-gifted types.

Q returns again (hurrah!) and Riker grows a beard and the holodeck begins to exert its colorful influence on the series and the crew survives the writers' strike, more dangerous than a pocketful of Klingons.  One misses Dr. Crusher, but no fear, she'll soon return for season three and beyond.  The ST:TNG program began to improve this season; by the next, all thrusters would hit warp speed at last.",1100822400,5,1272,4.762557077625571
1686663,5,B000062XFG,"We see some new uniform styles, some new plot lines, and a deeper look into the Star Trek mythos that made it great. The switching of Doctors was a bit abrupt, and I think having her be a trasporter-phobe was too McCoy-esque to be coincidental; I think the writers were TRYING (too hard) for us to like her. The same goes for trite manner in which Picard's heart replacement needed to be done by (suprise, suprise) Dr. Pulaski. Data's character was developed well, and I liked seeing the cast starting to settle into their roles. A good strong follow-up to a great beginning. This series was crawling in Season One, and definitely walking by the end of Season Two (making the audience wonder just how fast this baby will RUN.) A move that must be owned by the die hard fans, and a few disks borrowed by the casual fan friends of the die hard fan. It will not dissapoint.",1093564800,4,870,4.44375
1686664,3,B000062XFG,"Although better than the first season of Star Trek TNG, season 2 was extremely hot and cold.  A few great episodes, such as 'Contagion', 'A Measure of a Man', and 'The Emissary' (as well as a few more) make this season worth having.  Overall, I found Worf, Data and Picard to be fairly steady characters throughout this season, but the others seemed to waver quite a bit (I think the actors did a great job - it's as if the writers kept changing the characters on them!).

The character of Dr. Pulaski - although the actress herself did a great job - was simply repulsive and inconsistent to me.  She seemed extremely bigoted one minute, and then suddenly would become this selfless person rushing to someone's aid.  Then in another episode she would be portrayed as incredibly stubborn.  Writers, make up your minds!  The way she acted made me question why or how she would become the chief medical doctor on a starship, especially the Enterprise where she truly did not fit in.  The character of Dr. Crusher, re-introduced in season 3, was far better and more consistent, while also interacting more believably with the crew.  Once again, I emphasize that the acting was actually quite good - the writing was inconsistent.

On the other hand, there is some good character development throughout this season for most of the bridge crew, with the exception of Riker who was also portrayed inconsistently.  I must also admit that Wesley Crusher tends to get on my nerves - needing a young teenager to get the federation flagship out of trouble multiple times does not make any sense.  However, there was some decent development between him and Picard.

If you have not seen any of this series yet, I would strongly recommend not starting with this season.  But, for all you out there who have seen and enjoyed it, there are some great episodes in here.",1091750400,,1851,4.708074534161491
1686665,5,B000062XFG,"The First Season of Star Trek: The Next Generation gave the show a firm foundation and a good block to build upon.  We saw a new Doctor in Kate Pulaski and it picked up right where the First Season left off.  Geordi LaForge has been promoted and is now serving as the Chief Engineer, Data's qualifications for being a lifeform are questioned, and argueably the best villain in Star Trek is introduced.  Unfortunately, there are 22 episodes in this season instead of the normal 26 episodes due to a Writers' Guild strike, however, the season finishes strong and gives another block for the upcoming savior of Star Trek third season.  Though short, Season Two is a great season in this show.

1686666,3,B000062XFG,"I'm a big trekkie, but I'll have to say that this is probably one of the weaker seasons.  The short season had to do with the writer strike, which is fine.  But because of this by the end of the season it ended on a very weak episode which was mostly footage from past shows.  This is the one that most people complain about.  But I also couldn't quite see the point of The Royale.  I mean, it didn't didn't really give us a better understanding of the ship or the people, not exacly.  I've also heard about people not liking Dr. Pulaski.  That's too bad.  Diana Muldaur actually does a good job, but I guess she just never really meshed too well with the crew.  She reminds me of the crusty Bones though, whom I liked very much.  (Just wish she wouldn't have picked on Data just because he's an android.  Maybe that's why people didn't like her.  I mean, Data is quite the popular android, no?)  I've bought all the boxed sets because, well, I'm a trekkie, and I wanted a complete collection, but I'd have been much happier if Paramount had not charged so much for this season at least, especially since it has less content.  OK, I'd have been happier if they charged less for all the sets in general :-) , but in particular this one.  Heck, if Stargate SG 1 is only half the price.....  Ya know what I mean?  I think it was just following the trend set by X-Files or something.  Sigh.
But at least by the second season everyone is more established, so things have settled down a bit.  Q is always good.",1055548800,2,1504,4.2695035460992905
1686667,3,B000062XFG,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation's"" second season begins with Riker's new beard, Geordi's promotion, a new (but not better) doctor, and Wesley the weasel deciding to stay aboard. Sounds like a mixed bag to me. The season premiere ""The Child"" doesn't have much in the way of excitement, and Marina Sirtis wasn't quite as good yet to carry the episode, but it looks great with some neat looking exterior shots and an introduction of Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan the bartender. The from there the season continued with a few gems (""Elementary Dear Data,"" ""Q Who?"") and a few more missteps (""The Outrageous Okona,"" ""Pen Pals,"" ""Shades of Gray).
We meet the Borg in a great episode with Q, played by the always-dependable John DeLancie, Data butts heads with a holodek version of Moriarty, Riker finally comes to terms with his father, and Wesley is given his first command. With a writer's strike hindering the production of the episodes, many of them feel rushed. A few potentially cool ideas like ""Contagion"" and ""Peak Performance"" feel lacking in suspense or direction.
Ah, but the cast is perfect and carries out each episode wonderfully. Even the terrible stock-footage show ""Shades of Gray"" is handled well by the cast. However, the season lacks two major characters from season one: Tasha Yar and Dr. Crusher. While Yar can't come back (she died late in season one), the good doctor does return in season three and she's welcome. Diana Mulduar is a talented actress, but Dr. Pulaski just isn't compatable with the other characters.
My recommendation is to get season two only if you're trying to collect them all. It's not the perfect season and there's much better ones out there.",1044489600,13,1680,4.898245614035088
1686668,5,B000062XFG,"I became a huge fan of Star Trek:TNG by the time the second season began.  But the 1988 writers' strike nearly sidelined the entire future of the show. Fortunately, they were able to salvage the season and managed to come up with some great stories.  Definitely one of my favorite episodes of this season, and one of the best of the whole series, is ""The Measure Of A Man"".  As one reviewer has already stated, this episode alone is worth the price of the box set.
My other season two favorites include, ""Q Who?"", ""The Outrageous Okona"", ""Loud As A Whisper"", ""The Dauphin"", ""The Icarus Factor"", ""The Royale"", ""The Emissary"", ""Up The Long Ladder"", and ""Shades Of Gray"".
Anyway you look at it, Star Trek:TNG season two on DVD will become a valuble addition to your collection. LIKE THE FINEST WINES, IT JUST GETS BETTER WITH AGE!",1041897600,3,827,4.612244897959184
1686669,5,B000062XFG,Season 2 was Great! This Season is a great experience for all you trekies out there. It was different from all the other seasons. The Original Dr. Crusher was not in it and was replaced by Dr. Pulaski who did very well in the season even if she never had the same relationship with Captain Pichard as Dr. Crusher did. The season was shortened to only 22 episodes instead of having all 27. And it still was very entertaining. This is a Season that is worth the money spent and is great to add to your Star Trek collection.,1039305600,,521,4.2727272727272725
1686670,4,B000062XFG,"Although I don't like the style of the box too much, and I'd rather have had the box be a more durable material than cardboard, overall a great buy!",1033862400,,148,4.137931034482759
1686671,5,B000062XFG,"In the second season we lost Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to Starfleet Medical.  In reality, the shows producers felt her character wasn't working out.  Thank god we get her back in the third season.  Not that I didn't like Dr. Pulaski, I just didn't feel her character was working out.  We begin to see where The Next Generation is going in this season, although at this point it still hadn't caught it's running legs.  They hadn't completely worked out the terminology, the uniforms and the general feel of the show.  I've read that a lot of people didn't like the Wesley Crusher character, I guess I'm one of those few that did.  I think he added to the family atmosphere.  Some shows that highlighted the season in my opinion:
Elementary, Dear Data
Loud as a Whisper
A Matter of Honor
The Measure of a Man
Contagion
Time Squared
The Icarus Factor
Q Who
The Emissary
In my opinion, the first seasons loss of Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) was a loss to the show.  Her loss did give the producers the extra room to begin concentrating several shows throughout the seasons on Worf.
Overall a good season that starts to give us a good idea of how good The Next Generation will become.",1031443200,2,1183,4.516431924882629
1686672,4,B000062XFG,"The second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was immediately troubled with the writers' strike in Hollywood, thus many of the episodes fall short of being the usual inspiring episodes fans have come to expect.
What is most interesting and significant about this season is the introduction/departure of certain characters and the development of already familiar faces.  At the forefront, Gates McFadden was not invited to return for the second year (she'll be back) and thus Dr. Beverly Crusher was replaced with Dr. Katherine Pulaski played by the witty Diana Muldaur.  Curiously, Muldaur chose to be listed not as a regular star but as a special guest star.  Whoopi Goldberg joins the cast as the bartender Guinan in the newly shown Ten-Forward lounge of the Enterprise.  As for character development, the whole crew rallies behind Data in the episode ""Measure of a Man"", we finally get a permanent chief engineer with LaForge, and they have decided that Wesley is not a member of the senior staff and does not have the right to be in on all the staff meetings (as he did throughout the first season).
Some excellent stand out episodes are: Contagion, Q Who, Pen Pals, Peak Performance, Time Squared, The Emissary, and The Measure of a Man.  Some episodes that are still too painful to watch: The Outrageous Okona (the biggest stinker ST:TNG episode of all time!), The Royale (apparently they had a great idea but the budget was cut at the last minute), Shades of Gray, and Loud as a Whisper.
Although I am a die-hard fan of the Dr. Crusher character, I am saddened that the Dr. Pulaski character was never seen or heard from again.  We have no idea what ever happened to her.  After three (soon to be four) movies, three spinoff series, and lots of crossover episodes, there has never been a single mention of her.  So, if you like Pulaski, buy this DVD set, since it is likely to be the only time you will ever see or hear of the character.  And if Ms. Muldaur ever happens to read this: ""Diana, despite all the criticisms of the Pulaski character, you did a great job.  Thanks for the year you gave us!""",1029196800,13,2114,4.658602150537634
1686673,5,B000062XFG,"The second season is essentially like the first, the set and DVD layout is essentially the same. The most notable different is the number of episodes: there are only 22, not 26 like the first season. Apparently there was a strike that year with one of the guild working on the series (I think the writers guild), and so only 22 episodes were produced.
The extra features are nice, some people have complained that there are not enough of them for the price, but if you think about it, the cost of the box set is a lot less than purchasing each episode on tape. With the cost of each episode on tape running about [price], the DVD is a steal, even at the list price the episodes run about [price] each.
Most of the episodes in this season are better than the first, but to rate them here would take too long.  Letting one or two episodes I disliked bring down the rating of the box set doesn't seem right to me anyway. People who like Star Trek: The next Generation and have purchased the first season will probably purchase this as well regardless of whether they loved or hated each spisode.",1029024000,,1092,4.379310344827586

1686675,4,B000062XFG,"Aside fom the drastic changes that happened between seasons(casting and character promotions),The second season of TNG was a big improvement over the first. Yet it was still far from the great show it would later become.
  The intrduction of Guinan(as well as Ten-Forward)and the temporary residence of Dr Kathrine Pulaski in The Child,added a new dimension to the show. The best episodes include The Measure Of A Man,The Emissary,A Matter Of honor,and of course Q Who,which not only brought back Q,but introduced The Borg.
  The second season was a strong indication of the great things to come.",1026864000,,596,5.11340206185567

1686678,5,B000062XFG,I was impressed at the quality of the picture since these shows were from the late 80's and the only problem I found was with the sound that seemed a bit low from my DVD player .

1686679,3,B000062XFG,"The technical aspects of the DVD are superb but this series contains some real clunkers e.g. Shades of Gray and the Royale. I watched series 1 several times and each time managed to find new nuances and things to keep my attention but some episodes in the second series just fail to rivit ones attention having weak plots designed for... TV. I wish the BBC had given a fraction of the budget to the early Dr Who stories that would have been a show.
On the positive the debut of the Borg and the scene setting for the future make this an essential purchase if only to give the grand children an insight into late 20th Centuries view of the future.",1022889600,,646,4.347107438016529

1686682,4,B000062XFG,"For some reason, unknown to at least me, the networks in Australia showed Series 2 of ST:TNG when it debuted out here.  And to be honest I'm glad they did as I doubt I would have become so impressed with the show had I seen the first series initially.  The cast really do come together very well, Picard is more likable(for want of a better word or phrase)and far less uptight, the relationship between Riker and Troi starts to come into it's own right from the first episode plus Geordi and Worf seem much more comfortable in their new positions as engineer and security chief.  Also the relationship between Dr Pulaski(who I have always liked) and Data is quite good, if not a little bit like the relationship between McCoy and Spock.
I'm only giving it four stars because although there were excellent shows, there were also some less than memorable ones.  The best would have to include ""Elementary, Dear Data"", ""A Matter of Honour"" and ""The Measure of a Man"".  Others that are also good are ""Loud as a Whisper"" and ""Unnatural Selection"" plus one of my personal favourites ""Manhunt"" as I love Lwaxana Troi!  And while I agree that ""Shades of Grey"" is weak, I would hardly call it the worst.  That honour has to go to ""The Royale"".  Truely horrendous.  At least as far as clip shows go ""Shades of Grey"" is tolerable, well that's my opinion!
All in all though, considering that production was hampered off stage by writter's strikes, writter's coming and going and big budget cuts to episodes, Season 2 is very good and sends the programme off onto bigger and better things very, very nicely.",1021161600,3,1594,4.624113475177305
1686683,4,B000062XFG,"You know, it's just not fair. I plunked down just as many shekels for this NextGen box set as I did for the first one. Now that might not seem like much of a problem to most, but here's the messed-up part: this set contains only six DVDs, rather than its predecessor's total of seven . So why am I paying the same price for something that has less? Wouldn't it make more sense for me to pay six-sevenths as much? Of course, if that screenwriters' strike hadn't cut down NextGen's second-season eppie total, I wouldn't've had to worry about it in the first place...
...but enough griping, at least for the moment. Compared to the original series DVDs, the NextGen platters have more episodes per disc (four to Classic Trek's two), and the and the box set takes up about the same space as three standard-width snap cases. Which means the entire run of NextGen DVDs will take up about two-thirds as much space as the entire run of original series platters presently do. Of course, this makes me wonder why Paramount didn't give the classic show a similar treatment in the first place? After all, when it comes to collecting Star Trek on video, shelf space becomes an essential commodity. This is after all a franchise made up of five series, nine (soon to be ten) movies, and a cartoon show, with endless sequel & spin-off possibilities! With these facts staring a DVD-collecting UberTrekkie in the face, one can NEVER have too much shelf space, and... um... whoops, I did it again, didn't I? Sorry `bout that. Gimme a mome to get back on track, okay? Thanks...
While not particularly exceptional, NextGen's second year was a fair improvement over the first in many respects. It displayed a potential that would eventually make it a worthy successor to its 23rd-century forebear. The follicular abilities of Riker & Picard went in opposite directions as our beloved overly-dramatic-pose-prone executive officer sprouted facial hair. Worf & LaForge receive new uniforms and new duties. Also noted here is Ten-Forward and the first poker games between the members of the bridge crew. Then there was THE big shake-up: Dr. Crusher was temporarily replaced by a somewhat McCoy-ish woman who wasn't too keen on the notion that Data might actually be more than a mere machine. Sadly, Dr. Crusher neglected to take her son Wussley-- whoops, I mean Wesley with her, much to the chagrin of most NextGen trekkies outside of the adolescent female demographic.
A few of the show's high points in Year Two:
Being a big fan of the Borg, I consider `Q-Who' to be the best moment of the second season. In this show, Q introduces our star-hopping protagonists to the Borg-- and the rest is history. `The Measure of a Man' is probably one of the best Data-showcase eppies ever made. In fact, a good portion of the second season was dedicated to the further character development of Starfleet's most valuable android: There's `Elementary Dear Data', as he plays the part of Sherlock Holmes tracking down a self-aware holodeck creation of Prof. Moriarty. I found it to be a better-than average entry in the show's run of `Holodeck Malfunction' eppies. In `The Schizoid Man', Data's taken over by the consciousness of a dying cyberneticist. `Pen Pals' has our beloved android making covert contact with an alien child on a dying world. Riker also gets some development in `A Matter of Honor' and `The Icarus Factor', both of which have a bit more action than the average NextGen eppie.
Then of course there's the shows I'll likely skip past when I host my next NextGen marathon:
 Being a Wesley Crusher anti-fan (as any self-respecting NextGen Trekkie should be), viewing his first crush with a young lady who can morph into a weird furry wookiee-thing in `The Dauphin' was almost unbearable. And although `The Royale' is kinda fun to watch in a cheeseball way, it's definitely not one of the series' more able entries. To top things off, they saved the worst for last: the season finale `Shades of Grey'. I prefer to call it `Riker's Greatest Hits', since about half of the footage for this show was culled from the first two seasons, all of it featuring our beloved Number One's greatest moments of both blissful pleasure and hellish torture from the show's first two years.
As I expected, the sound quality of each episode is really good, far better than their preceding VHS presentations. The subtle background sounds are more perceptible. The picture quality, however, is not as consistently good as that of the First Season set. There are a few parts here and there that look a bit grainy. Of course, this may be due more to the quality of the source film than the digital transfer, but I couldn't tell you for sure one way or the other.
The extra features include several documentary featurettes, which cover pretty much what you'd expect from TV docs: behind-the-scenes looks, memories of the show's second year from both cast and crew, and other info. If nothing else, these featurettes are a good way to prep you for that trivia contest they'll be holding at the next convention that blows into town! I found the doc about the Star Trek archives- a vast collection of props, models, backdrops, and set pieces from all the shows and films- to be the most interesting of the lot.
And now, my biggest gripe about this set: Paramount decided to make the foldout disc holder out of cardboard, which means you'd better expect this storage unit to disintegrate faster than a Romulan hit by a full-power phaser beam after several NextGen marathons. Well, unless you have some duct tape ready that is.

1686684,4,B000062XFG,"There were moments during the second season when Star Trek: The Next Generation was as good as it ever got, and a few moments when it was worse than it ever was before or after.
Three standout episodes elevate this season, any one of them on par with the best episode of the next two years.
The first was ""Matter of Honor.""  Cmdr. Riker is assigned to serve as an exchange officer on a Klingon ship.  The dynamics of Riker with the ship's crew elevate this episode well above the rest.  Only a cheesy Wesley-centric subplot spoils the fun.
The second is ""Measure of a Man,"" the one episode where the series hit one out of the park in the first two years.  Cmdr. Data's legal status is in question: Sentient being or toaster, to be disassembled at Starfleet's whim.  Hits some pretty heavy subjects without preaching or taking the easy way out.  This also introduced the poker game that ran through the rest of the series.
The third standout is ""Q Who.""  The pesky god-like entity Q re-appears, asking to join the Enterprise crew.  They need him, he claims.  Rejected, he attempts to prove his worth by flinging the 1701-D into a far corner of the galaxy and an encounter with the Borg, a nasty and implacable enemy.  Exciting and dark, this was great Star Trek of any generation.  Unfortunately, this was the swan song for Q as a sinister presence.  After this episode, he's not much more than a mildly annoying comic foil for Picard.
The low points for season two are ""The Child"" and ""Shades of Gray"".  The season opener ""The Child"" was a desperate attempt to cope with a writers' strike by dusting off a script from the aborted mid-seventies revival of Star Trek with the original cast.  The shotgun marriage of generations is dull, plodding and ridiculous.
""Shade of Gray"" finished out the second season in even weaker fashion.  Little more than a clip show hung around a weak premise about Riker nearly getting killed by an alien plant and needing his memories ""stimulated"" to save his life, this was another casuality of the 1988 WGA strike.
There were a few more episodes that make the second season worthwhile.  ""Elementary, Dear Data"" is probably the best of the ""Holodeck malfunction"" episodes that would later become one Star Trek's most annoying cliches.
""Up The Long Ladder"" is a mostly light comic episode that also deals intelligently with the serious issues of abortion and cloning.
""The Emissary"" introduced fan-favorite Keylahr (sp), Work's ex-girlfriend.  A good episode by itself, it would be followed up two years later by one of the fourth season's best.  Unfortunately, it also led to the introduction of Alexander, Worf's son and one of the least necessary characters in Star Trek history.
The extras are well done, mostly new interviews with Rick Berman and old interviews with some of the cast and crew, including the late Gene Roddenberry.  One thing that kind of hit me was the fact that the new Berman interview was tape less than a week before 9/11.  How I envy that man on my TV right now because he's still living in the world that existed before that day.
The only quibble I have is the price.  This set is one less disk than the others in the series but it's the same price.  Far be it for Paramount to be fair with its DVD pricing.",1020902400,10,3265,4.631944444444445
