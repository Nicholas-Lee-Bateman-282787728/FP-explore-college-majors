7812152,5,6301415116,"Billy the Kid, 1989 film

Sheriff Brady and his posse head to their ranch. Mr. Tunstall said his store was taken over, and now its the ranch. Theres not much law in 1879 New Mexico. Sheriff Brady has a Writ of Attachment for Tunstalls ranch. Tunstall rides to see the Territorial Governor, but he is shot down on the road! In the midst of life there is death. Billy and his friends arrive in Lincoln. Billy is warned, Brady knows he is a witness to Tunstalls murder. Billy and his friends act first. Dolan orders the capture of Billy dead or alive. Billy and his friend ride to Fort Sumner. Pat Garrett owns a tavern and was just married. Billy finds a girlfriend. Billy wins dealing 3-card Monte. Billy is promised a pardon by Governor Lew (Ben Hur) Wallace if he testifies against Tunstalls killers.

A man bets Billy about killing a man that night; Joe Grant loses. Things have changed in Lincoln. Billy returns to the courthouse; visitors turn in their guns. Governor Wallace wants to break up the Santa Fe Ring. Billy worked as a ranch hand and gambler since age 12. Will Wallace keep his promise? Billy is arrested after living up to his side of the agreement. Did Wallace lie to him? Pat Garrett asks for the job of Sheriff. Mr. Maxwell backs Garrett. A newspaper reports John Chisums herd was stolen. Billy gets a photograph; he is advised to go to Old Mexico. The newspapers report stories about Billy. Garrett tells people he will arrest Billy. Billy and his gang steal cattle to make their living. The newspapers popularize Billy the Kid. Garrett has a lead on Billy. There is an ambush by the lawmen. Wheres Billy? He and his friends are hiding in an old cabin. They were followed by an experienced tracker.

Garrett says to wait them out. [Who is colder?] When does the moon come up? Charlie Bowdre is shot. The rest surrender. Is Billy doomed? One guard taunts him. Then Billy goes to the privy. He finds a present! His manacles are removed. Billy uses a shotgun against Bob Ollinger then escapes. The newspapers report this sensation. Billy is protected by the Mexicans. One advises Billy to leave the Territory, things have changed. All of his friends are dead. Billys reputation has gone to the big cities back East. [Publishers print books that sell.] An old man talks to Billy before Pat Garrett arrives. I know where he is says a drunk. Is Billy bad? A hungry Billy decides to get some beef at Pete Maxwells place. Quien es? I knew that voice.

Robert M. Utley wrote a biography about William Henry Bonney. The hat in Billys photograph was not his usual hat, he always wore a wide-brimmed high-crowned sombrero. [This made him look like a Mexican from a distance.] I think this movie is as accurate as possible for a Hollywood movie. It skimps on the economic rivalry between Murphy (the established business) and Tunstall (the new competitor). Economic conflicts caused this Lincoln County War just as in the Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming (between the cattle barons and the small ranchers and homesteaders). The old moves from the 1930s-1940s echoed these stories. Modern movies used personal conflicts as the basis for their dramas. Walter N. Burns wrote The Saga of Billy the Kid in 1925. Billy was known to have at least one daughter. He preferred dancing with women to drinking whiskey. The old Fort Sumner was replaced by the new Fort Sumner in the early 20th century.",1429228800,2,3399,4.66

7812154,5,6301415116,"Finally found this movie on Amazon, quality on VHS not the best, but you cannot find this movie on line any where. One, at least for me, one of the best Billy the Kid films made. Wish it was on DVD. If you like Val Kilmer, check this out, a good portrayal of the Kid.",1371600000,5,267,3.8727272727272726
7812155,5,6301415116,Great film with a very young Val Kilmer. It's different than any of the other portrayals. If you're a fan of Val's I really recommend it. To bad it's never come out on DVD,1325203200,4,171,4.0588235294117645

7812157,4,6301415116,"This is a great story. Best Billy the Kid ever and written by Gore Vidal. After about one week of filming, Val Kilmer was really into his character and actually looked like the picture of William Bonney. I was there. I was the Location Manager on this film. It was shot at the Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, AZ. Gore played the Preacher in the Cemetary. You can check it out of IMDb.",1193356800,2,382,4.2465753424657535
7812158,4,6301415116,"This is not a glossey high amp western with a great sound track like the Young guns set. It doesn't even cover much of the Lincoln county war. What it does have though is a somber  and gritty realism. What it covers of the kids life is historically pretty accurate. I gave this film four stars because of the fine portrayal of the kid by Val Kilmer. He shows him as a some what awkward troubled adolecent with a wry sense of humor. And when he has the famous portrait done,with that toothy grin, he really could pass for William H. Bonney. I recommend this movie for those who don't require constant action and would enjoy a good historic story.",1098748800,12,645,4.375
7812159,3,6301415116,"This movie was pretty good, and I speacially like how they had Billy not drink much in the beginning. Sadly, they did the traditional thing and made Billy have very few partners. In the movie, Billy and Tom kill Brady and one deputy, in actuality, Billy, Jose Chavez Y Chavez, and 4 other regulators killed Brady and 3 deputies. I also hate how they skip the entire Lincoln county war.
Kilmer did good as Billy, but they made him too cold blooded. I admit, Billy wasn't a romeo or a Robin Hood, but Billy was not cruel! Every man he killed had it coming to them. In the movie they made Billy get mad fast and in the end he drank alot, where as in reality he didn't drink and he wasn't easily angered(or there'd have been alot more people killed by him).",982368000,12,753,4.2727272727272725
