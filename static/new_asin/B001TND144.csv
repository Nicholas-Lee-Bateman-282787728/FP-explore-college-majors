8342086,3,B001TND144,"Frank is a great teacher and his courses are excellent. This one is no exception. One word of warning. This is NOT the complete Inversion Excursion course. Go onto the Truefire site to get the complete course. The DVD being offered here is their Abridged Course which only covers major chord inversions. This includes major triads, major 6, major 7 and major 9 chords only. The complete series covers all the minor chord variations, dominants and b9, #9, etc. It also covers vertical movement, I IV V progressions and Cycle of 4ths. I agree with everything that the previous reviewer (R. Holcomb) has said, but understand that you are only purchasing roughly 25% of the entire course.",1289260800,17,684,4.854700854700854
8342087,5,B001TND144,"Frank Vignola is one of the best guitar virtuosos in modern jazz.  He is a patient and gifted teacher.  This class on chord inversions is another example of his excellent work.  It does not go too fast for developing beginners and it includes information to aid even the most advanced players.  This is another quality guitar educational video from TrueFire.com, a company well known for its pursuit of excellence in instructional materials.  I highly recommend this course for anyone wishing to study the variety of chord voicings on the guitar.",1252713600,6,546,5.022222222222222
