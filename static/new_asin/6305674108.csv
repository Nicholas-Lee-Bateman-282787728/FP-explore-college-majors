1058010,4,6305674108,"Sometimes all that I expect from a movie is to be entertained--- and this film fit the bill. ""My Life So Far"" was a charming movie and a delightful look inside a family living a somewhat odd life on an estate in Scotland in the 1920s. We see the action of the movie through the eyes of the 10 year-old Fraser and via someone who is observing what is occurring.  The household consists of the family, including Fraser's grandmother who owns the estate, many servants, and frequent visitors.
The movie is more a series of vignettes/memories of the Pettigrew family and its more pronounced quirks. Fraser's father Edward, played brilliantly by Colin Firth, is an oddball inventor who runs the Pettigrew Sphagnum Moss Factory - the only one in the world. His two loves are the Bible and Beethoven. His brother, Uncle Morris, visits infrequently but when he does, it can be disruptive, especially when he appears with his very young fiancee, Heloise, with whom all the males become enamoured.
This was based on a true story - taken from the memoirs of the former director of the Royal Opera House. I wish I had known this in advance.
I cannot finish without commenting on the gorgeous scenery, on the ground and from the air, conveniently shown when one of the many visitors is a colorful and legendary pilot.
The final scene of Fraser, sitting in his father's office, listening to jazz, smoking a cigar and drinking milk from a wine glass while looking at forbidden photos was such a hoot! It will linger in my memory for a long time...priceless!",1043712000,92,1542,4.6900369003690034

1058012,5,6305674108,"This is a coming of age story but unusually about BOTH a father and son who mature during the course of the film.  The father, played by Colin Firth, does mature in the last few minutes of the film, without uttering a word, and it is one of the most powerful sequences I've ever seen on film.  The film alternates between showing Firth as an utterly delightful father figure, because he is a complete eccentric, and as someone who needs to grow up and accept his responsibilities. At the start of the film, he is almost more his children's boon companion than their father whereas, by the end, he is most definitely a father.

The film is told from the point-of-view of his young son and we meet quite a cast of characters, all living on an estate that is owned by the matriarch of the family.  Who will be able to remain at this estate depends upon whom she leaves it to in her will.  Malcolm McDowell, her grasping other son, wants it for himself and to throw the others out.  This is a film the whole family can enjoy.  If you are expecting to see Mr. Darcy though in this film, from Firth's portrayal of him in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" you will be disappointed.  Firth plays a very different kind of man in this film and does so beautifully.

1058013,4,6305674108,"I enjoyed this movie very much. While it's not a five star movie I consider it to be well done by all actors. I am a Colin Firth fan since watching Pride and Prejudice. I wish he would make more movies like the famous Pride & Prejudice. I feel his talents are not being used to his best potential. Or maybe he isn't choosing the movies which show his talents as he did in P&P. You will enjoy the young man who is telling the story, for the story is about his life as he sees it.",970272000,12,478,3.9381443298969074
1058014,3,6305674108,"This film had great potential, but it was too ambitious and tried to be too inclusive in telling the story. There are really two main story lines here: (1)Young Fraser's (Robbie Norman) coming of age and (2) His father  Edward's (Colin Firth) misadventures.
Fraser's story (which the title  implies is the point of the film) is fabulous. It is a whimsical and witty  look at the coming of age of a ten year old boy in 1920's Scotland. He  learns about sex by furtively studying his grandfather's books and pictures  of unclad women. Put in the context of a completely naive ten year old  mind, he develops some funny interpretations of the subject that are  routinely and innocently blurted out in the presence of adults, usually to  the mortification of his parents. This was a wonderful story and his  journey to manhood should have been the subject of the entire movie.
The  second story line was dull, and encumbered the film. This is the story of  Fraser's father Edward. It centers around two key subplots. The first is  his kooky childlike lifestyle, including crazy inventions and ineffective  businesses. The second is his obsession with his Uncle Morris's (Malcolm  McDowell) fiance. Other subplots in this story line include a rivalry  between Edward and Morris for the inheritance of the castle. This overly  dramatic subplot bogs down the film and ruins the comedic and mirthful  elements provided in Fraser's story.
The cinematography was splendid,  helped greatly by the beauty of the Scottish countryside and the  magnificence of the Castle the family called home. Fortunately, there was a  character with an airplane that gave director Hugh Hudson a convenient  excuse to show aerial views of the castle and the countryside which were  simply breathtaking. The photography in this film is reason enough to see  it.
The acting was excellent. Though I wish the character had less  emphasis, Colin Firth was excellent as Edward, the quirky father figure.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio gave a fine performance in a minor role as  Moira, Edward's wife and the mother of his ten children. Once again, she  had an opportunity to showcase her beautiful singing voice (see  ""Limbo"" if you want to really hear her sing). Malcolm McDowell  and Irene Jacob were also excellent as the uncle and aunt.
The best  performance by far was that of Robbie Norman as young Fraser. He was full  of innocent mischief and gave a convincing portrayal of the curiosity and  nescience of youth.
I gave this film a 7/10. If you enjoy interesting  character studies, slice of life films, beautiful scenery and comedy  spawned of innocence, you will love this film. Had they stayed with the  main story line, I probably would have given it a 10.",956016000,62,2731,4.9144736842105265
1058015,5,6305674108,"Are you a discerning movie goer? Do you enjoy the medium, but dislike sex and violence? Now, do you also lament the fact that many films devoid of these two elements are also devoid of a compelling story, characters, and  beauty? Look no further. This film will satisfy all your wants and needs.  It feels very modern, yet is a throwback to a time when nuance and  suggestion carried much more weight in a film than the latest porno/sadist  blockbuster. If you desire the latter, don't look here. But if you want to  see proof that a very fine movie can be made without those 'other'  elements, take a chance on 'My Life So Far'.",951436800,21,629,4.426086956521739

It was filmed in gorgeous rural Scotland and we get to watch Colin Firth for 1-1/2 hours. That's win-win.",1425772800,,273,5.2272727272727275
1058089,4,6305674108,"I picked 1999's ""My Life So Far"" to watch because the DVD cover made it look like something light - maybe a romcom, I wasn't sure - and after almost an hour went by I found myself thinking, ""What the fokk is this movie about?!"" This is perhaps why one reviewer described it as ""not plot-driven."" Thankfully, I was able to catch a grip with the final third of the film where the various story elements came together. This is basically a coming-of-age tale of a boy, Fraser, who's around 10-11 years-old in 1920's Scotland. His family lives on one of those huge country manors with a strong matriarch, Gammy (Rosemary Harris), and a household staff. Elderly Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell) visits with his young French fianc, Heloise (Irne Jacob), who incites the fascination of both Fraser and his dad, Edward (Colin Firth). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Edward's wife.

The film immediately brings to mind 1993's excellent ""The Secret Garden"" due to the fact that both take place on British country estates in the early 1900s, albeit the former in Scotland and the latter in England. While ""The Secret Garden"" is the superior film, ""My Life So Far"" won me over despite my initial apprehension. Fraser's coming-of-age parallels his father's maturing. Edward is a likable inventor who runs the sphagnum moss business. He's fun, likable and preaches at his church, but he's resistant to change and refers to jazz as the devil's music. His spirituality is tested by the arrival of Heloise and is found wanting; worse, he can't hide his childish infatuation from his wife.

It wasn't until AFTER watching ""My Life So Far"" that I realized how smart it is. It makes its many points simply through showing the day-to-day life of the Pettigrew family one season in 1927. For instance, although Edward is right about the brilliance of Beethoven, he's wrong about jazz. And although his good side shines brightly, his glaring hypocrisy cannot be condoned. This isn't just testimony to the power of a beautiful woman; it's testimony to the necessity of character and faithfulness. These are just a couple examples and I expect to raise my rating the next time I view it because this seems like one of those films that gets better on the second (and third and fourth) watch.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK.

GRADE: B

***SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further unless you've seen the film.

Did Edward have ""carnal knowledge"" of Heloise? No. Edward comes on to Heloise in the moss loft (or whatever) and she clearly rejects him, albeit respectfully. Later, during the big blow-up, he informs his brother-in-law, Morris, that he had sex with her because Morris was his rival for the estate, but it's A LIE. We know this because Heloise plainly declined his advances. So why did Edward lie? Evidently to stick-it-to his rival and cause the ensuing marriage problems. It was also his way of getting back at Heloise for (gently) rejected him. Bear in mind that on no occasion was Heloise guilty of improper conduct; she's almost godly and even rebukes Edward's hypocrisy at the dinner table, albeit subtly. Edward's lie was a very ignoble thing to do and it made me lose respect for him, but it was the result of his pent-up frustrations. Thankfully, he later humbly repents, to which his wife forgives and they go on to blissful matrimony.

I hope he apologized to Morris and, especially, Heloise as well.",1423353600,,3431,4.824829931972789

1058094,5,6305674108,"""My Life So Far"" is a bittersweet coming-of-age tale set in scenic Scotland in the 1920s. Rosemary Harris plays matriarch of the McIntosh clan, living with her daughter Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), her eccentric inventor husband Edward (Colin Firth), and their brood of children. Most notable among these children is precocious ten-year-old Fraser (Robert Norman) whose natural sense of curiosity and keen adventurous spirit get him into the most hilarious situations.

The family's idyllic existence is threatened with the arrival of Moira's brother, Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell), a millionaire who looks down upon Edward's efforts to keep the estate going (cultivating spaghnum moss, of all things). Morris tries to get Edward to buy into his ideas to revitalize the estate, to no avail. In the meantime, Morris' beautiful young fiance, the cello-playing Eloise (Irene Jacob) beguiles everyone, including Fraser. Unfortunately, Edward too is smitten and a bitter rivalry develops between Morris and Edward. How everything plays out makes up the rest of the story.

The casting in this movie is excellent and together with beautiful cinematography, the film makes for a fun and engaging viewing experience. The one flaw here is the the inclusion of side plots that seem to go nowhere - the large, disheveled man Fraser keeps bumping into on the large estate who is eventually found drowned (this just seemed a waste of time), the French pilot who seems to be interested in one of Fraser's sisters (once again, heads nowhere), etc.

The actor who portrays Fraser is excellent, for truly he is the star of the show. Fraser epitomizes the sexually-curious young boy keen to learn about sex and other forbidden topics. Some of the most hilarious scenes are when Fraser blurts out silly nonsense, including the scene at dinner; when the guests discuss fundraising activities, Fraser helpfully chimes in that his mom and Aunt Eloise can be prostitutes and service his father and Uncle Morris! Turns out young Fraser has been reading the illicit literature collected by his deceased grandfather, kept hidden in the attic.

It's a fun and bittersweet coming of age tale that I'm glad to have discovered.",1391904000,4,2207,5.208450704225352

1058207,4,6305674108,"Hugh Hudson (""Chariots of Fire"") made this beautifully shot film in 1997 afterwhich it languished on the shelf until exposed at Cannes in 1999.  Set in pastoral Scotland in 1920, the film focuses on a 10 year old boy named Fraser (Robbie Norman) whose sexual awakening brings trauma and humor to his family and their staff.

Fraser is the son of Edward (Colin Firth), an eccentric inventor and sphagnum moss farmer and his wife Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Moira is an heir to a wealthy family now headed by her widowed mother, known as Gamma (wonderful Rosemary Harris). The family resides in Kiloran, a large estate of beautiful hills, bogs and lochs.

When Moira's older brother Morris (Malcolm McDowell) arrives to introduce the family to his much younger 24 year old French fiance (Irene Jacob) both Edward and young Fraser are taken with her.  When Frasier questions his dad about ""feelings"" he's having along with ""wet sheets"" after dreaming, Edward stumbles with an explanation.  Frasier then seeks his own information by researching his grandfather's healthy book collection...complete with photos.

Simon Donald's script does a nice job by portraying each character as not perfect or perfectly evil as we might surmise.  The film is ploddingly slow some of the time and requires some patience even with a brief 93 minute running time.  And the ending seemed a bit too tidy for my liking.

It seems rather melancholy but if you're into such, you might find the attraction. However if you hope to see Colin Firth played in a more romantic light, you will be disappointed. I imagine it's the type of film that would earn some acclaim to the artistic direction. I cant say I lived it but maybe you might.

If the movie had portrayed this as realistically as it started out allowing us to see the ""adult"" after effect it would have been worth watching and more stars. It would have been a sweet story that everyone could have related to, but still unique. But instead Hollywood had to turn the plot on its ear making it a teaching lesson for the liberal tenants of ""different is good"" and ""tradition is bad"". The movie is just another attempt at making normal traditional Christian minded person seem like someone not to aspire to while making eccentric people who disregard moral convention the interesting person.

Though nothing terribly unusual or exciting happens, we see a real family interacting in a genteel time and place that makes for a very sweet story.  Fraser (Robert Norman) is a genuine kid; he wants to know everything at once, often says the wrong thing, and keeps secrets (or so he thinks).  Gorgeous Colin Firth gives a winning performance as Fraser's absent-minded but loving father who succumbs to temptation.

I liked the way the characters' dialogue often overlapped each other and at other times seemed mumbled - just like real people speak.  There's an utterly genuine feel to the story that just unfolds, simply, and at times uneventfully, and yet we know memories will be treasured when the boy grows up.

I would not show this movie to young people under 17, simply because it has some 'adult' moments.",1220659200,4,580,4.466666666666667
1058277,4,6305674108,"My Life So Far is the memoir of an engaging 10 year old, charmingly acted by  Robert Norman. His traditional Scottish family, portrayed just after The Great War, lives the cultured life of the British upper class, but times are changing. Fraser and his eccentric inventor father (Colin Firth) both fall for the lovely French fiance of an older, wealthier family scion, and the competition begins. Feeling belittled by his dad, Fraser vows to exact revenge by educating himself in the ways of the world by reading forbidden books. His strategy works, but there are several comical moments that develop because he does not quite understand what he is reading. The movie reaches a crisis when the family matriarch dies, and the denouement brings major changes. The actors are all well suited to their roles, the scenery is idyllic, and My Life is a charming, gentle story of times gone by.",1210896000,8,886,4.867549668874172
1058278,5,6305674108,"I enjoyed the film very much.  I found it amusing & delightful about an inquisitive, precocious youngster.  A few of us found out about life this way.  Some parents had a difficult time explaining our questions.  Some may have done what gorgeous Colin Firth, the father did if they had the opportunity.  I will definitely watch it again.",1156550400,13,337,4.741379310344827
1058279,4,6305674108,"Set in the 1920s, this film is enjoyable and charming while also touching on some of the darker aspects of growing up. Told through the eyes of a young boy, the actions of the adults seem even sillier and more laughter-provoking. However, this is no straight comedy. It touches on themes of  marital discord, puberty (never fun) and ultimately, the ""meaning of life.""

The scenery is beautiful and Colin Firth is gorgeous in an atypical role as an inventor. His character is not all sweetness and light and that makes him more interesting. Firth fans, please take note of the fact that he appears in almost every bit of the film. It's fun to see him in the role of an eccentric dad (although you know you're getting older when you lust after the actor in the film that plays the father!)

Great acting, charming story and ultimately an uplifting film.",1119225600,24,851,4.622516556291391
1058280,2,6305674108,"I orginally bought this film and I'm assuming you want to buy this film because it has Colin Firth in it... as a Colin Firth fan I found this movie boring and lacking what Colin usually gives us in his films.

In this one Colin is an inventor with a rather large family including a young rambunctious son who enjoys wandering around the estate causing havoic and looking at pictures of nude paintings. What seems to be the happy family is shattered when Colin's brother brings his have his age french fiance Heloise who he becomes infatuated with-- eventually one day in his factory room he tries to force himself upon her... eventually, his wife learns what has been going on and blows up at her mother's funeral. The movie ends with a reconciliation. The movie takes place through the view of Colin's young son-- focusing more on himself and the events he takes in around him.

All in all I found this movie rather dull and it's not the kind of movie Colin was made for... For really what woman wants to see Colin playing an adulterer? All in all buy Love Actually or Bridget Jones Diary watch Colin charm you in a movie you'll enjoy...",1108857600,13,1138,4.492753623188406
1058281,4,6305674108,"This movie will appeal to anyone who enjoys watching movies about large sprawling families, oddball characters, and little slice-of-life episodes.  It's the 1920s and Fraser Pettigrew is 10 years old.  He lives with a swarm of siblings, a devoted mother, a kindly grandmother, and an eccentric father who invents odd gadgets and invests in strange things (such as sphagnum moss).  Things get even more mixed-up when Fraser's uncle arrives.  Not only does the uncle treat Fraser's father with a kind of affectionate contempt, he has brought along a much younger fiancee - a sweet and musical Frenchwoman.  Fraser, who is becoming curious about sex, and is only just seeing that his father is not infallible, is shocked when he notices that his father pays a great deal of attention to his uncle's fiancee.  A rift in the family looks imminent, particularly when Fraser's mother discovers that her husband desires another woman.

In all, My Life So Far is a sweet coming of age story with some troubling episodes, as when Fraser's father childishly competes with him for attention from the Frenchwoman (who, unlike in other movies, is not a home-wrecking siren, but is actually a good woman who is faithful to her fiance).  The movie treats the complexities of family life and childhood with humor and care.  The visuals are also beautiful - the Scottish countryside does not disappoint - and there are other scenes that linger in the mind (a tender dance in the rain, for example).  Really, this is a great movie for a quiet evening at home, snuggled under blankets.",1091318400,34,1565,4.916349809885932

Set circa 1920, when Fraser Pettigrew (Robert Norman) is a 10-year-old the story centers around his childhood memories of his eccentric inventor father, his mother who gave up a stage career to raise a family, and an uncle who came to the family estate in Scotland with his 24-year-old French fiance.

It is a family centered, biographical story--a memoir--of a child who is curious about artwork depicting naked ladies and his grandfather's ""secret"" library.  Also involved is the conflict between his father who is reaping sphegnum moss from the family estate for a variety of products, and his uncle who thinks his father's ventures are folly.  Uncle Malcolm hopes to inherit the estate from the grandmother and throw everyone else off the place and market the lumber.

There is an interesting story here, but not a thriller or murder mystery.  It is what it purports to be a story of a youngster's early life.

1058283,4,6305674108,"I was bored one day and I flipped to IFC. They were playing this film so I decided to give it a try. Well, in the same likeness that an old song begins to inch its way into your heart, this film slowly began to grow on me. I sat there thinking, why am I watching this, only to find myself laughing at the absurd family in this film as I started to envision what it must have been like to grow up in that eccentric, if not completely captivating, clan.
In it, we meet a very inquisitive young man who discovers booze, sketched porn and smoking. His father, battling his own cravings but fronting a semblance of virtue, objects to just about everything his curious son seeks. It is here that we witness the comedy and wit unfold.
Give this film a try. The main character is hard to forget and the story, although uncouth is some segments, will still leave a fun impression on your mind",1089331200,20,883,4.261904761904762
1058284,2,6305674108,"Coming-of-age stories appear in all shapes, forms, and sizes. And if scenery and a top-notch cast could make a good movie, ""My Life So Far"" would be astounding. Unfortunately, the end result is rambling, poorly-edited, with subplots that do nothing and a dull lead.
Fraser Pettigrew (Robert Norman) lives in a rambling Scottish estate with his enormous family, headed by his brilliant, eccentric father Edward (Colin Firth) and a strong-willed matriarch (Rosemary Harris). Like most kids, Fraser decides that he wants to know what adults know, and takes steps to find out: He studies his grandfather's collection of classy porn, watches his sister flirt with a plane pilot, and investigates the inheritance rumors flitting around

But his studies of adulthood takes an unexpected twist. His elderly Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell) arrives with the beautiful young Heloise (Irne Jacob) from France. As Fraser befriends (and becomes slightly enamored of) Heloise, he doesn't realize that Edward has become infatuated with her (midlife crisis, where is thy sting?). The increasing tension in this family threatens to explode, unless both Fraser and Edward grow up.

The settings for ""My Life So Far"" cannot be faulted. The vision of rural Scotland in the 1920s is genuinely lovely. There are plenty of lakes, mist, slightly crumbly castles and beautiful aerial shots of the woods and fields. And when the film focuses on Fraser's determination to come of age, there's a gentle, syrup-less humor to the writing.

Part of the problem is sloppy editing. Most of the subplots go nowhere and offer nothing. For example, Fraser sees a strange, ragged old man wandering around, who then dies mysteriously. Nothing comes of this, and no one cares. Similarly, his sister's flirtation with the plane pilot comes to nothing. The script meanders all over the map in a seemingly random fashion and peters out from lack of interesting material, rather than actually ending.

Most films hinge on the lead actor's performance, but unfortunately Norman is a very unengaging actor. He doesn't have the sparkle to charm us. Firth and Jacob's considerable talents are wasted; Firth's character flipflops randomly between being pitiful and being a genius; while this is how the character is supposed to be, we don't get to know him very well. And poor Jacob is basically reduced to a walking pretty face with a French accent.

When you hear that ""My Life So Far"" is based on the early life of a BBC pioneer and Chairman of The Royal Opera House, you would assume that it's much more interesting than it is. Only a few spurts of humor and the underused talents of Firth and Jacob redeem this at all.",1076112000,7,2674,5.027088036117381
1058285,4,6305674108,"This original and deliciously spontaneous film is a story of the intellectual development of a prodigious child who pieces together the complex emotional mosaic of the people around him. The acting of the kid in question is so real, so absorbed, that you'll hardly feel like an onlooker -- you become a part of the family. This is complemented wholesomely by Firth and Harris.
The setting is Scotland, and the splendid camera work that captures its idyllic natural beauty is something to behold. The shots of the huge Scottish castle and its beautiful lands are fascinating.
A word about the gentle narrative. Things unfold neatly, the story is seen in flashbacks through the eyes of the ten year old. Bearing this in mind, the plot's disconnected moments and the occasional odd characters suddenly make sense. Very clever.
The feeling of coming to terms with the emotions of people around you conveyed with such simple elegance, even a sporadic humorous moment or two, that I recommend you to watch it with just about anyone that you care about, including children.
A very special, light-hearted treat!",1069545600,20,1103,5.0
