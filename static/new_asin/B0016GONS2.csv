8262449,4,B0016GONS2,"This is the great story of the historic Amrapali (500s BC), royal dancer of the Vaishali kingdom of Eastern India (Bihar) who renounced worldly life and joined the Buddhist path of peace. She made this decision after the destruction of her nation in a war her lover, Ajathashatru, fought to gain her. The lover, ruler of the enemy kingdom of Maghada, disguised as a soldier, had not disclosed to Amrapali his true identity. Their love deepened before she found out about him. Her loyalty and patriotism to her nation stopped her from continuing the relationship. Once she saw the suffering and deaths caused by the war, she joined the path of tranquility by becoming a Buddhist nun. Ajathashatru also gave up violence.

There are many Amrapali tales, and the movie deals with one of the less popular versions. History sources confirm that she was a courtesan, epitome of beauty, culture and art, and highly skilled dancer.

Both Vaijayanti Mala and Sunil Dutt have done a superb job. Two of the dances show the phenomenal skills of Vaijayanti Mala. The music is poor to mediocre. A very good movie overall.",1255996800,5,1106,4.8465608465608465
