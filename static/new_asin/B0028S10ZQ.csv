Thank you!",1350345600,,140,4.185185185185185
8356842,5,B0028S10ZQ,"The long-shelved, missing-in-action 2006 Indie about a crazy group of insane Hollywooders during a nutty week in Tinseltown: one is a porn star named Johnny (who is played by LA restaurantuer, Emmy nominee and former GENERAL HOSPITAL star Michael Sutton), another is rap star Coolio, one a man in an ape suit and one a man who foolishly buys a blowup sex doll for his insulted girlfriend. The four vignettes are wisely intertwined in this hilarious must-see comedy of goofy but good, crisp writing, directing and acting. And though it played only at a couple of filmfests, it will finally be released this summer after three long years on the shelf!",1245110400,2,649,4.8558558558558556
