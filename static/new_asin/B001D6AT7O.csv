8291865,3,B001D6AT7O,"""Area 51: The Alien Interview"" is an interesting piece of modern mythology (think Roswell, UFOs and X-Files). While the program claims to be a real documentary, it's better approached as lighter entertainment. I watched it for free elsewhere on the web. This DVD apparently contains some extra features, which I haven't seen.

The backdrop to ""The Alien Interview"" is that some of the aliens from the crashed saucer at Roswell survived and were taken to an airbase for questioning. There is also a surprisingly elaborate conspiracy theory about a secret deal between the U.S. government and evil aliens. The latter are allowed to abduct humans at will, and in return the military gets alien technology. Area 51 or Dreamland, a real and top secret military installation in Nevada, is where the UFOs are supposedly retro-engineered by our boys. ""The Alien Interview"" combines the two myths into one, claiming that live aliens are being held at Area 51 alongside their saucers.

The most sensational item in the ""documentary"" is a short video clip showing a supposed alien in a darkened room. The sound has been removed, but apparently the creature is being interviewed telepathically. Suddenly, the alien gets into a fit and is worked upon by two medical doctors. There, the clip ends. A couple of true believers, including Whitley Strieber and Jim Dilettoso (a supporter of Billy Meier) vouch for the authenticity of the ""alien interview"". The token sceptics (who work with masks and special effects) say the alien is a dummy, and that they can do better ones. But sure, the hoax is somewhat better than the notorious ""alien autopsy movie"" shown by Fox Channel years ago...

The real highlight of the show isn't the alien, however. It is the purported whistle-blower, one Victor. He seems to be wearing a werewolf mask (sic) during the interview, but since the lights are dimmed, we can't really be sure. He also spouts large sunglasses and speaks with a distorted voice. Above all, he has a terrible attitude, threatens to terminate the interview at several points, and openly admits that he has sold the alien video for ready cash! He actually ends by saying: ""I'm going to collect my money now"". LOL.

I admit Victor is pretty entertaining. He is also somewhat smarter than other whistle-blowers. Since the man presumably doesn't know anything about retro-engineering, he flatly claims that the alien can't communicate technological concepts, and instead steers the interview onto a more ""spiritual"" course. Apparently, the Extraterrestrial Biological Entity or EBE believes in reincarnation. Now, *that's* an easier concept to talk about, especially if you have read two or three cheap New Age paperbacks. That being said, the spiritual aspect of the UFO phenomenon have been part of the myth from the start, so I suppose we can't really fault Vic for blowing the whistle on the quasi-Theosophical connections of the EBEs...

Apparently, this DVD also features a new interview with Victor, made about ten years later. Well, what can I say? Enjoy the show!

Now, where's my money?",1368489600,2,3082,5.057086614173229
8291866,5,B001D6AT7O,"I treasure this DVD! I certainly believe in the existence of extra-terrestrial life elsewhere in the universe. This DVD contains about 2 or 3 minutes of footage of what is claimed to be a real-life alien which was being held in a secure facility somewhere on Earth.

The background story as to how the footage was smuggled out under high security is interesting and believable enough. The person who provided the footage disguises his identity - he will explain why - and gives himself the name ""Victor"".

Victor sounds plausable, confident, and oozes a creepy king of charm. If you outright don't believe in this kind of stuff then I doubt this video will convince you otherwise. If you believe already then this DVD might just give you a great sense of satisfaction and wonder.

Some of the experts shown the tape (including experts in creating special effects for movies) think the alien, if not real, is very well done. One thinks it's definitely a puppet, while Robert Dean (Command Sgt Major US Army, retired) becomes visibly moved when he sees it.

The alien is in a darkly lit room for reasons which are explained, with some sort of (heart?) monitor in the foreground. The alien appears to have a coughing fit, at which point two nurses appear and perform a medical check - one shines a small torch into the alien's face and checks its nose and eyes. The mouth is seen to change shape during this time - if it is a puppet it's a good'un and one would have to ask the question: Why would anyone bother faking this? I doubt there would be much money in it but lots of trouble!",1329436800,,1582,4.540350877192982
8291867,1,B001D6AT7O,"This was ridiculous on so many levels.  Honestly, I was a fool to purchase this, and now I am that much poorer financially and mentally.  It is clear that puppeteers  are at work, and this producer has made some money from the ignorant like me.  If you have half a brain cell left, and are not holding not to some weird unsubstantiated beliefs, you will find this work annoying.  Seriously, shop around for other products.",1320969600,2,422,4.573333333333333
