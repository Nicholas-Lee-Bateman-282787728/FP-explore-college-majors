You don't have to worry about the ridiculous LIE of evolution as you won't find it here in this movie ... there's no ""Budda boom budda bing, the world just appeared and remarkable things formed all on their own from blobs and baboons!""

Halleluyah - this is a Creation based biblical movie where kids learn the truth that a magnificent Creator Yahuah God created everything including the dinosaurs.  This video is biblically sound, and entertaining, and well done, and totally kid friendly and fun. Thank the Lord for videos like this that present truth!",1366588800,3,717,5.059322033898305
3775938,5,B001RG79PA,Wanted the alternative view for the grandkids...not just the PC taught at school. Even parents and grandparents have enjoyed it,1354579200,3,127,5.4
3775939,5,B001RG79PA,"bravo! this film is laugh out loud funny, like 80s buddy cop movie funny!

I admit it, I'm a boring person, but after watching this video I felt the years of viewing things with logic and reason swept right away.

So you supply the popcorn, and this film will supply the mental drano which we all crave.

Cheers!",1318809600,12,312,4.344827586206897
3775940,5,B001RG79PA,"Superbly done.  Biblical answers to all the tough questions ask about the dinosaurs, ie, ""Is it true that dinosaure have been extinct for 60 million years"".  Don't let public education brainwash your kids with answers of what some scientists who refuse to accept creation by God as outlined in Genesis be the final answer.",1284940800,9,322,4.944444444444445
8337911,5,B001RG79PA,I absolutely loved using this to show my children why some people are just simply less intelligent than others. This movie is wonderful for showing why the Christian faith is corrupting our youth and that it's simply just dying. 10/10 would recommend to any parent who also still believes that vaccines give autism or that abortions are the work of satan!!!! ,1481414400,2,359,4.885245901639344
8337912,5,B001RG79PA,"Just watched this on Pure flx. It is a great video! My children have been soundly educated in Creation and this was a good reinforcement of what they have learned. I highly recommend it, especially for those who have never examined the evidence. The wording is simple enough for children, and although it was just a touch corny, adults will appreciate the solid information.",1464739200,,374,4.859375

8337917,5,B001RG79PA,"This is just a wonderful video to teach young people that there is good scientific evidence of what dinosaurs were like, and Biblical references to dinosaurs living at the same time as people, and evidences that dinosaurs are part of God's creation.  We are using this video for our 3-6th graders, though it would be great for teens and their parents too.  The video contains good scientific data, and yet they do not use overly-long scientific words- the material is very understandable.",1392768000,2,488,4.939024390243903
