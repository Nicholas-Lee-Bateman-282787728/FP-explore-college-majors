8412999,3,B0041KXMO6,"The discs looked perfect inside and out because they were still sealed, but the box did not have the most presentable look. It was bent on the side a bit, and inside it was just plain white paper-ish material. The bottom of the box both inside and outside were shabby, and so was the envelope with images.",1458691200,,305,4.368421052631579
8413000,3,B0041KXMO6,I knew that it was region 2 when I ordered this Audrey Hepburn Collection. I love the movies (which are in English). I didn't know the artwork would be in Italian. It would have been nice to see in other reviews a mention that the DVD covers are all in Italian. I still love these classic films and am glad I got the set!,1384128000,,321,4.03125
8413001,5,B0041KXMO6,Audrey Hepburn Couture Muse Collection... Ms. Hepburn is amazing.  I love her and I love this set.  True fans MUST get this collection.  Ms. Hepburn can be watched all day!  Love her so.  I love the box too!,1362009600,,207,4.342105263157895
8413002,3,B0041KXMO6,"The round cardboard box looks pretty nice in the picture... but it's not really that good.

It feels really cheap and the inside is just awful. If you want to get this as a really special gift for someone that loves Audrey Hepburn, be prepared to spend some time and cash to buy materials to improve the inside of the box.

* The label (with Audrey's picture) is stuck onto the cardboard like a cheap sticker.
* Opening the lid you'll have the sense of... such a big box for ""this""? The person receiving the gift will definitely expect something else or at least more DVD's in the box. The DVD's are in another smaller box aligned in the center with a flimsy piece of black cardboard.

In short: The packaging looks like some kids school project (done in 1 day)... you might be better off wrapping the pictures and the smaller DVD box by yourself and just getting rid of the round box.

The DVD's seem to be fine but there are a few movies missing which makes this a very bad collection in my opinion.",1319587200,2,1001,4.336898395721925
8413003,4,B0041KXMO6,"I always check out the ""others"" and end up coming back to AMAZON.  It will make it easier in the future as I will just start and finish here.  Great job with presentation, availability and best of all price!",1307232000,,207,4.282051282051282
8413004,5,B0041KXMO6,It has almost any Audrey Hepburn movie you could ever want and none that you wouldn't want. The box was adorable and the cards inside were very enjoyable!,1294963200,2,154,4.535714285714286
8413005,4,B0041KXMO6,"These are some of Audrey Hepburns greatest works. The only movie missing for me was Two for the Road, that was a great movie and some of her most honest acting to date. The box that it comes in is true to the picture. The item itself is packaged tightly and safely. The movies come in a cardboard box for easy shelf storage. The disks were all secure in there cases none were scratched or loose. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of Audreys. But you would definitly need to purchase Two for the Road, How to steal a Million and Wait until Dark to complete your collection.",1292371200,6,585,4.232142857142857
8413006,5,B0041KXMO6,"The product was reasonably priced and delivery was quicker than I expected.  I purchased the item as a gift so I can't tell you anything about the quality of the DVDs in the collection.  Basing on the quality of package it came in, I'd say the DVDs inside the package would be in the same condition as the beautiful package it was wrapped.",1271894400,5,339,4.365079365079365
