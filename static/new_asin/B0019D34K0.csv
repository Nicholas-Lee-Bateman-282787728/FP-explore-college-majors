8273577,3,B0019D34K0,"Like Charlton Heston's other, much more ambitious directorial effort Antony and Cleopatra, Mother Lode has long been pretty much impossible to find: initially only available panned and scanned on a Swedish and a Spanish DVD, which isn't the ideal way to see a Scope film by any means, it's finally been released by Warner Home Video in a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer in the US, even including a half hour interview with writer/producer Fraser Heston. It also includes English subtitles, which are particularly useful deciphering some of the poor dialogue recording and Heston Sr's allegedly Scottish accent.

The film itself is a resolutely old-fashioned adventure/mystery as Nick Mancuso and Kim Basinger go in search of a friend who's gone missing while on the trail of the undiscovered source of some 19th century gold rush claims but while it gets bogged down in too much crawling in dimly-lit tunnels it's a lot more entertaining than anything with Chucky playing axe-wielding psychotic gold-digging Scottish twins has any right to be. It also has some great aerial photography that's particularly spectacular in widescreen, and if the plane crash looks impressively dangerous, that's because it wasn't in the script - it really did crash spectacularly on landing. Barely released outside the USA back in 1982 and Heston's last leading role in a feature until his role as Josef Mengale in the equally obscure Rua Alguem 5555: My Father 21 years later, it may be a fairly minor semi-swansong that doesn't stand up well to a second viewing, but as an undemanding, decently-crafted bit of old fashioned filmmaking there's still something reassuringly comforting about it.",1216944000,4,1678,5.214814814814815
