8464946,1,B005C9YZSC,After reading the other review I was excited to see this film. I love Chinese films and I am not unfamiliar with slow paced contemplative screening. This movie had no redeemable qualities. The dialogue was so awful it was humorous. The acting was stilted and the story was disjointed and just plain silly. The only slight points it should get is for some (not all) of the cinematography. The colors were good and the props were well selected. Run from this movie!,1319500800,,463,4.658536585365853
