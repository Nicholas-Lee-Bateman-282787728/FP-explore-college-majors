8377098,2,B002PM9VPG,"A small nugget of a double crossing whiskey drinking hedonistic Rishi Kapoor playing himself.  If there is a morale to the bizarre tale it is not evident. I say do not waste your time, do something useful with it.",1449014400,,213,4.461538461538462
8377099,4,B002PM9VPG,"It's no way the best film of this year, but surely is one of the best. An earnest effort! Kapoor has written, directed & executed the film aplomb. Right from the moment we are taken to this small town, it catches your attention. Plus, The first 30 minutes are hilarious, the scene where Rishi is welcomed, the entire sequence is the most memorable sequence of the enter prise.
Performance-wise: Rishi Kapoor is excellent. The veteran plays himself, though a caricature here, shown as rude-turned likable character. He's in full from, once again. Priyanshu Chatterjee is fabulous, though his romantic angle with Kulraj Randhawa is boring and minus point in the proceedings. Saurabh Shukla, Grusha Kapoor & others give first-rate performances.

on the whole 'Chintuji' is a gem of a film. Face-Value wise, nothing. Script wise, Fab! Thumbs Up!",1300924800,,841,5.094202898550725
