1053770,5,6305538522,"I was completely addicted to Jem & the Holograms when I was growing up!  I never missed an episode, and when it finally went off air (BAD move), it was syndicated for one full year on USA Network channel, so I taped them ALL!  Of course, the sad thing about VHS is that even the best quality suffers after a few years of shelf-sitting...so I'm hoping that Rhino Video will see it as an excellent marketing move to release the entire collection on DVD (like they have with the Transformers).  Remember Jerrica & Rio?  Or Aja, Shana, & Kimber?  How about those Misfits?  Pizzazz, Roxy, Stormer, Jetta, and Clash?  And near the end...we had the Stingers!  If these all bring back wonderful memories of a great cartoon series full of '80's energy, then you have to buy this tape for your collection.  Better yet, write Rhino and ask them to box the entire series on DVD!  Wouldn't THAT be the best buy ever??",1020902400,15,904,4.49079754601227
1053771,5,6305538522,"Great episodes, Jem is back with avengance in this re release of the classic cartoons that tickled american kids in the 80's. If you are looking for something to take you down the 80's road of things that were, this is a good start!",1000252800,2,232,4.295454545454546
1053772,5,6305538522,"I love this cartoon! Jem has great values and a wonderful voice. Even my seven year old neice loves this cartoon. The animation is great, and there isn't a lot of cartoons left out there with as good a message. I encourage everyone to buy this. The story lines are great and the artistry really keeps your attention. The music is my favorite part though. If a seven year old can recognize that Jem is nice, stays fit, and eats right; then it has to be good! Don't you think?",999129600,,474,4.277777777777778
1053773,5,6305538522,"Jem is the #1 star in the world! She was dancen and singing way before any of our now day pop stars. She needs to be brought back out to the public. Jem forever! If your never seen it, here your chance!",999043200,2,202,3.8333333333333335

1053775,5,6305538522,"Who would have thought that after all this time, so many would still remember JEM?  The music, the fashions, so many things in a cartoon that captured the spirit of the 1980s.  Now, relive those memories through Jem  and the Holograms.  There's little violence, positive messages, and a good  story to go with the whole package....how many cartoons can say that  nowadays?  Buy this video and let Rhino see that we still love these  cartoons from our childhood.  Better yet, let your children see just how  good the cartoons we grew up with were....they'll love it too!  :)",954460800,9,573,4.744897959183674
1053776,5,6305538522,"Jem is easily the American equivalent of shoujo anime in Japan, that is, animation for girls. (Well, targeted at girls. Appeal is often much wider. Shoujo is just a style, not an exclusionary label.) And even though its  creators had no intention to draw from elements of anime, Jem just  ""feels"" like anime. Well drawn, actual plot, a (partially)  serialized storyline, songs you will remember 20 years later, henshin  (transformation) sequences, cute girls :) and I suppose it's somewhat  visionary in that it is probably one of the first ""magical girl""  shows that are all the rage now in Japan (there really kicked off by Sailor  Moon) and this was way back in 85/86! Jem was often derided as a 30 minute  toy commercial as was the unfortunate trend of the time, and some just  wouldn't look beyond that. Their loss. Jem would've been a hit even if  there were no Jem toys, though they would've been demanded later anyway! If  you're an anime nut like yours truly and have been (rightfully) bent to  thinking all American animation is a lost cause aimed at the 5 year old  mind or younger, buy these tapes! They'll change your mind. -  linley@megami.org",951091200,3,1157,4.72

1053827,5,6305538522,"I vaguely remember when Jem was on in my youth.  Unfortunately, my mind was clouded by mediocre cartoons with vague messages, useless lessons and uneccesary violence.  The video store near my house has three volumes of  Jem videos and as I watched them with my boyfriend (an avid fan) I was  converted.  Jem's messages are clear, her lessons valuable and tenacity  unrivaled.  This is sure to be a treat for seasoned veterans of the show  and kids who have yet to see the animated light.",936489600,2,487,4.647058823529412
7892299,3,6305538522,"Sometimes I feel some of these reviewers did not purchase the item but just write reviews based on the memories they had as a child. I don't think this was one of the best Jem episodes that was put out. I'm as much of a Jem and the Halograms fan as the next person but I would have to say this wasn't the best episode released. This was when Jem went to China. I would have to say I had to fast forward it a little because it was truly unbearable. I've been a Jemaholic for years but this particular episode I have never seen when I was younger. If you want to purchase a Jem and the Holograms VHS, I would suggest to get the DVD that was recently released. Now that was truly outrageous. That to me was the most outstanding re-release compared to this VHS. You pay a little extra but the DVDs(the complete 1st and 2nd season) are worth it. Endless hours of music and Jem.

For those Jem fans out there who are not particularly familiar with this episode I would suggest to past on this one because it's not the ""glitter and gold"" you remember.",1095638400,2,1044,4.1940298507462686
7892300,5,6305538522,"compared to garbage cartoons like ""Teamo Supremo"",""Robot Jones"" and the new Cartoon Network trash known as ""Foster"",the ""Jem"" series is entertainment. After deciding to watch the episodes on a freind's video tapes,I got to know ""Jem"" better and I like it. So if your children are bored by so-called cartoons like ""Fillmore"" or the new ""He-Man"",just pop in ""Jem"" and watch your kids get excited!",1092787200,4,394,5.076923076923077

7892302,5,6305538522,"This is one of my favourite Jem videos. It features 2 episodes:
""The World Hunger Shindig"" Jem & The Holograms perform a concert hosted by Miss Sally to raise a lot of money for the poor. Eric Raymond then tries to stop Jem & The Holograms from performing the concert by hiring Zipper and his goons to lock them up so that The Misfits will perform instead of Jem.
""Adventure in China"" Jem & The Holograms are scheduled to perform at the Great Wall of China. Trouble starts when the Misfits tag along and then steals the Jemstar earrings from Jem. The Holograms search everywhere for the Jemstar earrings but the earrings end up in a very unusual place.",1075420800,4,652,4.487394957983193

Jem and the Holograms are so beautiful. i was taken back when i viewed this cartoon. i was only 5 yer old when the cartoon was out and i loved it then and even more now. SO WHAT IM A 21 YR OLD MAN i will fully admit that i love this cartoon and grew up on it. one thing i didn't like that was so positive was those Misfits. they seemed so mean to her always looking for an argument or a fight. beautiful ladies but so so so BITTER! bitter songs like ''let's blow this town'' ''click/clash'' and ''i like your style''~ jem did her best dealing w/ the Misfits. i just love this cartoon. we need to see a DVD come out in the near future!",1064361600,,651,3.9022556390977443

This video (& all her videos) are entertaining for the entire family.  Not only is Jem a rock star she (Jerrica, Jem's true idenity) also manages a corporation for run-a-ways teens.  JEM is truly OUTRAGEOUS!! SHE'S JUST AWESOME!!

I was at school the time it started. I made sure that my mom taped every episode. Unfortunatly after years go by tapes get old. I would realy hope that they made Jem on dvd.

Jerrica and Aja because I thought they were so unique. This show was about a girl rock group fronted by the lead singer, Jem. It was fun, imaginative, colorful and excellent for little girls. Looking back now, I find it to be refreshing compared to cartoons on air today ranging from the violent to the plain old boring. This video is also perfect for people who remember the show and want to take a trip down memory lane.",1024099200,7,558,4.081818181818182
