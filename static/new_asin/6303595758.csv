721977,3,6303595758,"1969's RITEN (The Rite) is one of the least known of Ingmar Bergman's films of the 1960s. Part of that is because the film was made for Swedish television instead of enjoying an international theatrical release. But another reason is that RITEN is markedly inferior to his other films of the time.

In an unnamed European country, a judge (Erik Hell) summons a traveling troupe of three actors to investigate whether the play they have brought to his community is pornographic. Two of the actors are overtly neurotic. Sebastian Fisher (Anders Ek) is prone to starting fires and afflicted by ill health. he is also glum and insulting. Thea Winkelmann (Ingrid Thulin) is wracked with existential anxiety, overly sensitive and feels suffocated by her surroundings. Hans Winkelmann (Gunnar Bjrkstrand) is the level-headed one who keeps the troupe together.

By the early mid-1960s Bergman had moved on from religious anxiety to an interest in human relationships and psychology. The three actors can be seen as different aspects of a single personality, and Bergman's comments on this in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Images-My-Life-in-Film/dp/B00A16LCDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Images: My Life in Film</a>&nbsp;are worth reading. More mysterious is their relationship to the judge, which dominates in the shocking last scene which I won't spoil here. The connection of drama to religious ritual in Ancient Greek is a theme. There is also some daring sexuality here: it's hard to imagine some of the scenes even in a theatrical release of the time, let alone television broadcast.

Why is this not among Bergman's best? Although the director had his trusted cameraman Sven Nykvist on hand, the cinematography nothing special: the elegantly planned long takes of other films are missing here, and some shots break off haphazardly. The concerns of the film are too repetitive after THE SILENCE, PERSONA and HOUR OF THE WOLF, and neither Hell nor Ek are pleasant to watch. Still, Bjrnstrand and Thulin give an engaging performance. Furthermore, I'm left wondering if there is an homage here to Bergman's colleague Jean-Luc Godard, as the film is divided into a series of tableaux (like Godard's VIVRE SA VIE) and Thulin wears a distinctly Anna Karina-like wig.

So far this film has been given an English-subtitled release only by the UK company Tartan. There are no extras here, unfortunately, just trailers for other Bergman films that the company has released on DVD.",1383436800,,2511,5.414322250639386
721978,5,6303595758,"This astonishing made-for-television feature can easily rival Persona as Ingmar Bergman's most daring and powerful work.
I stumbled upon it on You Tube, with delayed English Subtitles; this UK version is superbly synched up and looks incredible.
With nothing but close-ups to make use of the small-screen palette, the story morphs from that of a realist conflict between
a censor and a theatre troupe to that of symbolic--and then actual--death. The reversal in the final scenes is simply stunning.
Instead of the issues of identity in Persona, Bergman goes after ideas about power and art, reaching back to Greek theatre
to produce a scary, intense, and ultimately devastating portrait of petty bureaucracy and the fragility of human life.
Like his other extraordinary film The Magician but distilled down to five characters and a few sets, The Ritual is
Bergman's No Exit: an obliterating examination of existentialism in action.",1367625600,,931,5.297297297297297

Most Bergman films are rigorously unafraid to be theatrical, stagebound, because the theatre can act as both a metaphor and provide the atmosphere of claustrophobic interiority that comprises Bergman's view of the world, and the characters who suffer within it.  'The Rite' takes Bergman's theatricality to extremes.  The film, with its austere, monochrome mise-en-scene, is divided into scenes, each one comprising theatrical exchanges between two people, which follow a very theatrical arc of conflict, power struggles and revelation.  These dialogues are framed by two stand-offs between the civil servant and the group.
  As this latter conflict suggests, there is slippage in the dialogues between individuals and their professional lives, with antagonists attempting to pierce the impregnability of the latter, by preying on the weakness of the former, often linked to failure in the body (excessive sweat, impotence etc.).  so, for example, while Sebastian is powerless against the Judge as a civil servant, his powers to enforce the law and control his behaviour, he can overpower him as a man with physical problems, spiritual absences and feelings of inferiority.
In this way, the deliberate theatricality expresses a sustained exercise in role play.  It allegorises an age-old conflict between Art and Society, about the limits set by one on the other; on the aesthetic imperatives of one to transgress those limits in order to reveal the truth to the other; on the irony that those who are Artists, who seek to comment on society, or talk to the people who live in it, must themselves live in society, and obey its rules.  Conversely, Society and its institutions are an Art, a creation, a particular, formal interpretation of human motivation.
The film is called 'The Rite', which is the name of the 'number' (as the subtitles endearingly have it) under investigation.  The 'rite' has religious overtones, reminding us (as Bergman did in 'The Seventh Seal') that theatre developed out of religious rites.  The theatre trio are known as 'Les Riens' (the Nothings), and the rite they are performing might be a funeral rite, the rite for a man about to die.  The rite is the Judge's way of coming to terms with his death, his life, his body, his love life, his lack of family and children, his unquestioning devotion to work.  We only learn about him in terms of the others, or in reaction to them.  The artists are merely priests presiding over his death, forcing him to confess, returning him to the primeval truth of Death, a force all the legal apparatus in the world cannot unsay.  Unlike Antonius Block, who tried to evade Death by questioning it, the Judge seeks to come to terms with it, reconcile himself to it, and to life, for good and ill.  And the only way you can do this is through Art, which is bigger, more powerful, more mysterious, and, ultimately, more frightening, than its votaries.",999734400,6,3113,5.04093567251462
7854221,5,6303595758,"This is one of my favorite Bergman odd gems. This showcases 2 of Bergman regulars while involving 2 other super talented actors. Gunner as well as Ingid always stun with their performances. If you like Bergman's more experimental period(Persona, Hour of the Wolf,Scenes from a Marrige) this is definitely in that category and for you. This is a play shot in a movie context. I think Bergman was a playwright more than director not just content wise but at heart. His best material has that play feel to it. Like Scenes from a Marriage The Rite takes place in several rooms. There recurring environment is the Judges chamber.
This one has a classic ending .  This film is an artist vs status quo study. This work is made to honor artists in a compassionate way that is like Tarkovsky's Andre Rebelev in it's message but the polar opposite in it's sarcasm.",1522886400,,854,4.655629139072848
7854222,1,6303595758,"slow, pedantic, dreadful. I merely echo what another viewer experienced in watching Ritual : the explanations of the Mass, here, offer little sense of  what Catholics do when we participate in the Mass,  and why. The Mass - is sacred. Bread and wine are confected by the priest and become the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus. We humbly receive Him in the Eucharist. He is the source and the summit of our very lives; We humble ourselves before God. In the Mass we worship Him and we thank Him for His great sacrifice of Himself to God the Father on the cross of Calvary in expiation for our sins, and for our salvation. I didn't sense in this video,  the depth, the solemnity, the sacredness of the re-presentation in the Mass, of Christ's sacrifice for us, as re-presented in every Mass throughout the days and nights in every corner of the world, for centuries.",1448755200,3,872,4.576923076923077

7854224,4,6303595758,"Nice film explaining the ritualized-meanings to the actions or rituals used at Mass. A very decent popular explanation of a lot that is forgotten by most people, celebrants (or presiders) included. Although the film maybe dated in appearance, the essential Eucharistic rituals haven't changed that much since Vatican II. I'd recommend the film to both clergy and laypeople. It is unfortunate that rituals in life, as well in liturgy, become stale and that original meaning, purpose and supporting emotion becomes forgotten.",1445558400,,523,5.469135802469136

7854227,1,6303595758,"As another reviewer said, this is definitely not the Bergman film that other reviews refer to. It starts out with the priest talking about rituals in different religions and times, and ends up completely distorting what Catholics do and why. His explanations have some really good aspects but mix in error and confusion. He really doesn't understand the Mass, the history of worship, or what true inculturation is. Don't waste your time with this",1435190400,4,446,5.04054054054054
