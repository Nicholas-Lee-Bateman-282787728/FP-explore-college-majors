8266076,2,B0017I6MMY,"I was expecting a travelogue that would help me remember the wonderful scenery I saw when I drove around the Great Lakes. There was some scenery in this 55-minute video, but mostly the video centered on the lives of a fisherman, a tugboat pilot, a Grand Traverse Bay grape grower, and a sailboat operator. The stories were interesting enough, but not really worth the $20 I paid for this video. I can't imagine I'll watch the video more than once.",1290038400,3,447,4.6
