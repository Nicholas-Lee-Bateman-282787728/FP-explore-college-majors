3495123,4,B001BN4WGI,"We watch this every year on Three Kings Day.  Love that there is three king's day materials on the nickjr website to go along with it.  Great for teaching kids about three kings day celebrations but NOTE---doesn't talk about why we celebrate three kings day or who the three kings were at all.  It's just talking about celebrating it but I love that there is SOMEthing out there.  If you want a movie about Jesus and three kings, in the Latino/Mexican tradition, I'd recommend the three wise men with Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen.  We watch that cartoon movie every year too.  Love it for teaching the kids about three kings day.",1364256000,,632,4.598214285714286
