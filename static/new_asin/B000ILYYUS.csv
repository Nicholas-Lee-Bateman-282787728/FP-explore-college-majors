2658911,5,B000ILYYUS,Good workout.,1430352000,,13,6.0
2658912,5,B000ILYYUS,Terrific product delivered well ahead of schedule! I look forward to a great exercise program to get back into shape! Thank you!,1426464000,,128,4.863636363636363
2658913,5,B000ILYYUS,...one of my favorites,1424390400,,22,4.75
2658914,2,B000ILYYUS,"This workout just didn't do it for me. I LOVED her upper body / lower body workouts - the music was energizing but not raucous. Also, I dislike the emphasis on weight loss as opposed to maintaining a fit body.",1392163200,,209,4.25
2658915,5,B000ILYYUS,"Fantastic DVD and covers all the muscle groups.  Unfortunately, due to neck and spinal issues I can no longer use it.  But if you're healthy it's an incredible instructional DVD for losing weight and really works!  Just don't over do and use too heavy weights.",1385337600,,260,4.733333333333333
2658916,2,B000ILYYUS,the video had some good exercises but very little use or instruction on free weights. I wanted a video on free weights.  Very disappointed.,1385078400,,139,4.791666666666667
2658917,5,B000ILYYUS,"If you are thinking that 20 minutes isn't enough time to get a good work out, think again. I love the easy to understand exercises. Kathy explains which exercises work which muscles and how to go from a beginning level to as advanced as you want. The lower body is more of a challenge but you will feel like you have had a good work out when you are done. The fact that the exercises are only 20 minutes it is very doable for any schedule. I used this video years ago and was glad to see it offered on DVD for convenience.",1372204800,,522,4.077669902912621
2658918,5,B000ILYYUS,"Love this fast and effective work out. I was a fitness instructor, I think this is a great way to stay on shape. My life is too busy to go to the gym, I stay in shape with weights and walks in my neighborhood. I recommend this to all levels. You can make it advanced or beginning. It is really fast but very effective.",1372032000,,318,3.984375
2658919,4,B000ILYYUS,"I bought this DVD because I was just starting out using weights, and I needed to have something to follow along with. These were quick workouts and easy to follow along with. Great for beginners.",1369180800,,195,4.6
2658920,4,B000ILYYUS,I have owned and used this workout DVD for years. The disc got broken and I just had to replace it.,1360108800,,99,3.761904761904762
2658921,4,B000ILYYUS,"I only do the abs and (butt?) workouts because they are awesome for toning and the butt one is very difficult. The dvd is worth buying just for those 2 workouts in my opinion. Also, each segment is only about 10 minutes. The other segments (arms, thighs, etc) are perfectly legitimate too but I just don't use them. Kathy isn't all that friendly or motivating so the workouts are straight business but that's ok. She does a good job of demonstrating the proper form for the exercises so you won't strain your back.  The dvd doesn't come with the dumbells so you'll want to get some in advance.",1325462400,,593,4.4907407407407405
2658922,5,B000ILYYUS,"As a long time fan of Kathy Smith, I found Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2 to be exactly what I was looking for to alternate working out with weights on alternating days and the selections allow for one long workout or broken up into sections.  Kathy Smith keeps the tempo lively, offers excellent cues making this DVD a wonderful, whole body workout.",1323388800,,349,4.5396825396825395
2658923,5,B000ILYYUS,"I have always been a fan of Kathy Smith's and have used many of her fitness DVDs in the past. I've never been disappointed! I love this DVD! I like that I can work my upper and lower body and my abs in less than hour. I love that instead of working individual muscle groups, she incorporates multiple muscle groups to be more efficient and burn more calories. I use this DVD along with Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight (first volume), Yoga Sculpt, and Tummy Trimmers. I mix up the workout every week, and I am noticing a significant difference! I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to tone, but doesn't have time to run back and forth to the Gym. I have two children and work from home, and I can fit this workout into my routine. Five stars!",1302480000,,756,4.293706293706293
2658924,4,B000ILYYUS,I like all Kathy Smith's DVD's.  This is a good one but it's just not a beginner's DVD and I didn't really expect to be.  I will save it until I'm up to this level.,1300147200,,164,3.657142857142857
2658925,5,B000ILYYUS,I have an injured leg at the moment and thank goodness for this dvd as it is split into lower body upper body sections I can work out my upper body whilst letting my leg rest.  It is no nonsense easy to follow and as a regular gym junkie I still felt the burn.  highly recommend.,1299542400,,279,3.9642857142857144
2658926,5,B000ILYYUS,"I have the Jillian Michaels weights workout (no more trouble zones), and the Jackie one, and this one is by far the best and the longest. The exercises are more novel here, they're easier to modify for harder and easier, and very well explained. I was definitely sore the next day!",1296345600,,281,4.529411764705882
2658927,3,B000ILYYUS,"Okay, i like to lift some sort of weights, so that is why i got this. Apparently I REALLY can't stand the older Kathy Smith. The pics on the last two Kathy DVDs have been pictures of her when she was younger and healthier looking,but now I feel like i am watching someone who eats unhealthy (not enough) and has not aged very well. I HATE her attitude also,so no more for me. I like Leslie so much better for some reason even though she talks ALOT and at times it can be a bit much,but better to look at a healthy body than skin and bones. Man, that felt good to say, but sorry for all the Kathy S. fans out there...",1278460800,,616,4.016260162601626
2658928,4,B000ILYYUS,"I had this one years ago and repurchased it on DVD.  I got bored with it fast but it is good for beginners.  Kathy is a little too ""loud"" for me on this one and there are just too many people on the set.",1276300800,,203,3.590909090909091
2658929,5,B000ILYYUS,"I've been doing the tape version of this exercise DVD for years and love it.  Twenty minutes a day has helped me stay firm and fit.  I do the upper twice a week, the lower twice a week and the stomach every day.  Try it, you'll like it.",1270425600,,236,3.875
2658930,5,B000ILYYUS,This is a great workout.  It works all the muscle groups and is challenging at any level with the options Kathy gives to follow a lighter group or the group that utilized heavier weights.  The other information contained on this DVD is very useful for any fitness level!,1259539200,,270,4.604166666666667
2658931,4,B000ILYYUS,This is a great quick workout for resistence training. Quality of DVD a little cloudy but I have a huge big screen so I'm sure it's the resolution. A great buy!,1224806400,,160,4.193548387096774
2658932,5,B000ILYYUS,"Of the two Lift Weights to Lose Weight volumes, this is my favorite.  It utilizes classic moves - there is nothing new and innovative here, but that is what makes it so effective.  Almost anybody coming into this workout for the first time will already be familiar with the basic moves or be able to pick up on them easily.  (Hooray for not having to waste half of your precious workout time setting up an exercise!)  Unlike many weight training programs that feature instructors using the same set of weights throughout (usually 3 or 5 lbs), you are encouraged to have two or three pairs of dumbbells on hand.  The heavier weights are used for many of the chest exercises and bicep moves, while the lighter weights are used for your triceps.

The program has two groups you can follow - one group does the standard repetitions followed by segments of pulsing movements before the next set begins.  This ""track"" is recommended for people who are just beginning.  People who are looking to build strength follow the second group and recover/stretch during the pulsing movements.  The bonus ABS section is good but not a super challenge.  The great thing about this  program is that all of the moves are basic, therefore when you begin to plateau all you have to do is use heavier weights to build more strength.

Safety tips and pointers on form are presented, so if you are new to weight training and want to be sure you are doing things right, this program is a good way to go.  As far as equipment goes:  two or three sets of dumbbells would be ideal;  an exercise mat would be good for the push-ups if you are on a carpeted floor; and a chair for tricep dips, leg lifts, and sitting exercises.  (A bench is recommended, but the only exercise you  actually lay on the bench for is chest presses.  A message comes across the screen saying you can do those on the floor with a pillow underneath you, so the bench isn't necessary .)  Some of the backup members use ankle weights in the leg segment as an advanced option - they aren't necessary.",1222560000,,2043,4.517711171662126
2658933,3,B000ILYYUS,"I bought the 2-pack that includes LWTLW 2 but haven't gotten to that one yet. Personally, since I'm not a beginner I like not having to listen to a long instruction preceding each exercise, and  I think they are good quick workouts. I use my own iPod now that I know the routines and just watch, so I can listen to my own music.

I know this may seem trivial but when I insert the DVD into my computer, on my screen the title reads 'LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOOSE WEIGHT."" If I had a dollar for every time I saw it spelled that way by posters on the Weight Watchers boards..arghh.",1219104000,,571,4.135135135135135
2658934,5,B000ILYYUS,"My sister told me about these Kathy Smith CD's. You can fit 20 minutes in a day, plus the 10 minute abs and feel really good about making a difference. She says in 6 weeks you'll notice a difference and it's true! My arms and back and legs are all more toned now. I'll keep going. I vary it by using Weights I and II in the series.",1217116800,,331,3.8823529411764706
2658935,3,B000ILYYUS,"I don't generally like weight-lifting, because I'd rather be moving around to exercise, but I try to do it two to three times a week because it's good for me, and this is the video I use. It's a decent challenge and I like the core balance additions to the lifting.  I like being able to alternate between the lower and upper body sections for variety. However, there are some badly done production elements. The menu section is incomplete, not listing all the sections available in the workout.  Also, the artsy camera movements in the stretch sections make me dizzy, and I skip over them. Still, the lifting is a challenge and a necessary evil!",1216166400,,646,4.608695652173913
2658936,4,B000ILYYUS,"I have been doing this DVD consistently for the past month and I have to say, my posture IS actually greatly improved and I am seeing definition in my arms.  The exercises add a new twist to your usual weight routines and Kathy's right about it helping your core and posture.  I don't really care for the floor upper body routine but the rest is great.  I love that arms and legs are seperate, as well.  I run alot so I use the upperbody section more often.  I deducted a star though for some poor cueing and technique instuction ( esp floor upperbody).",1212278400,,553,4.330097087378641
2658937,5,B000ILYYUS,"Over the years I have occasionally tried a Kathy workout and just never liked it. Her workouts always lacked something, mostly not challenging or interesting enough, I'm not quite sure, but they always left me dissappointed. One of those was Lifting Weights to Loose Weight 2 - not good at all.  Because of this, I never tried this one, assuming it would be about the same, until I recently discovered it at my local video store and I can't believe how much I like it. This one is REALLY good including her advice! I'm mean I love it!
It is a total body weight workout that allows you to either do it Jari-style (lighter weights, lots of reps and pulses), or Cathe-style (heavy weights, rest, multiple sets) all in the same workout. How clever. It kept my interest throughout and I felt it the next day. I guess it's worth weeding through the bad to find the few good workouts Kathy does have.",1210291200,,893,4.478527607361963
2658938,4,B000ILYYUS,I love it. Is real and is great. I lost weight like I HOPPED and the results were great and fast.,1203552000,,97,3.6666666666666665
2658939,5,B000ILYYUS,This video provides a really good workout and is really flexible in allowing you to target specific areas or get a complete body workout.,1202428800,,137,4.75
2658940,5,B000ILYYUS,I love the different segments so that you can customize your workout.  She gets you working up a sweat and you can really feel your muscles burning!,1200009600,,148,4.481481481481482
2658941,5,B000ILYYUS,After having my 2nd child I needed to shed 40 pounds that I had gained.  I did this video 3 times a week.  I worked hard and chose a healthy lifestyle.  My daughter is now 5 and I have since become an aerobics instructor myself.  Just so you know...you have to do more that just BUY the DVD--you have to actually follow her lead.  I love Kathy Smith.  She really knows her stuff.  I recommend this DVD to anyone!,1199577600,,412,4.139240506329114
2658942,5,B000ILYYUS,"I bought the VHS video about 4 years ago and love it!

One workout a day is effective (arms or legs) or if you have time, do both the arms and legs sections for faster results.  The abs section is terrific, also; it's 7 min. long.

So now I'm on Amazon buying the DVD since I'm sure the VHS tape will soon explode since I've played it so much over the years (although I just about have the whole routine memorized--also, it's easy enough to do a lot of the exercises in a hotel room when you're traveling, esp the legs workout).",1199232000,,528,4.1568627450980395
2658943,5,B000ILYYUS,"This routine is easy to follow and is easy to upgrade as I am getting stronger.  The 20 minute segments each (for upper and lower body) are a great way to divide it up.  Much easier to do than one long workout, energy-wise and time-wise.  For the weights, I used 3-pound weights exclusively at first for the upper body.  Then I added on 5 pound weights for some of the exercises as I was able to handle it.  You don't even need weights for the lower body workout.  (At least if you're a beginner like me.)  The section on abs is tough!  But I just work until I can't do any more, take a few moments to rest and then jump back in.  I don't worry about following along with every single repetition that they do.  And I have been able to see significant progress!  That's the fun part!!",1198886400,,783,4.1879194630872485
2658944,5,B000ILYYUS,"This workout is absolutely fantastic.  I own most of Kathy Smith's workout DVD's and think she is fantastic as an instructor.  I like how you don't have to be incredibly co-ordinated to do her workouts.  The DVD consists of a 4 minute workout, a 20 minute lower and a 20 minute upper body workout along with a short ab session at the end of the DVD.

What I love to do is a 40 minute aerobic session of one of her step aerobics and then I do her lower body twice a week (I would do it more but it is a brutal workout!) and I do her upper body workout 3 times a week.

It is the best workout DVD - definitely worth every dollar!!",1198368000,,628,3.9523809523809526
2658945,4,B000ILYYUS,"This video is good for people with tight schedule like me.  20 minutes good workout and you're done! the only thing is she is going fast and you have to pay attention which side of the TV you want to follow and make sure you have the right chair and bench which not many people do.  Overall, is not bad at all.",1197417600,,310,3.9838709677419355
2658946,5,B000ILYYUS,"With 15 pounds of left over baby weight and a lot of weakness after being inactive for the past yr due to pulling my back during an already hard pregnancy, I thought this could help me get stronger and it really has. As for the weight loss part, if you use a heavy enough weight (and ankle weight) you will burn a lot of calories doing this. I did not start to lose weight until I went and got heavier weights and also started a low-carb/low-fat diet (using the advice in the e-book ""Burn the Fat""), and more intense cardio (4 times a wk for 40 min). Then I started losing 1-2 pounds a week for a total of 6 pounds so far. She does explain in the video that you need a combination of weight training/cardio/stretching and diet to lose weight. It's a great intro to weight lifting. All the athletes are sweating profusely in this video and you will too if you do it right.",1196121600,,871,4.221556886227545
2658947,2,B000ILYYUS,"I had high hopes for this one. I am new to weights, usually I do an hour a day of taebo or the firm (allison davis) or pilates (ana caban) so mostly aerobics and toning without weights. But what I was looking for was to alternate with a weights workout to strengthen and tone muscle.
While I typically appreciate a fast pace, I found that in my smallish space retrieving the chair, moving the chair away, trying to put two chairs together to form a bench, getting the step in place and out of the way again, was frustrating to do in a hurry, I always have to rewind a little so I feel like I am wasting time wrestling with the equipment when I could be moving smoothly from one exercise to the next.
I just wanted a streamlined, challenging workout with simple moves. For my taste it jumps all over the place too much. Is it impossible to work out with the weights and not all the other stuff?? For one, I don't have the bench and don't know how to properly do the exercise without it. It just doesn't seem the same on the floor and the chair doesn't work when you are trying to recline on the seat and the back of it gets in the way of your arms. And in terms of equipment issues, it drives me nuts when I am on the floor using the chair for that calf exercise and it keeps creeping away from me. I spend as much time pulling it back over as I do actually trying to work out. I wish she spent more time on the exercises as well, it moves to the next one once I have just gotten into it.
And a word on the instructor. I've never understood when people have complained about the personality of an instructor and thought if you are getting a good workout who cares if you like them or not? But there is something about Kathy Smith that irritates me, and perhaps it wouldn't if I were liking the workout more, I don't know. She just seems to be forcing things too much, I don't think she is ""peppy"" I think she is trying to make the workout more exciting than it is. A valiant effort that unfortunately makes me dislike the video even more. I think a good instructor is one you don't think about as you are working out because you are focusing on the exercise and she drives me to distraction.
What it has going for it, it goes by very fast. If you have a lot of room to work out, and the right equipment, this might be more pleasant for you.",1195862400,,2339,4.12035010940919
2658948,5,B000ILYYUS,I had Kathy's first Lift Weights to Lose Weight and loved it.  I love this new version even better.  The twenty minute workouts are challenging but not intimidating.  I get maximum benefit from this workout!!,1194739200,,208,4.885714285714286
2658949,4,B000ILYYUS,This is a great video for someone who prefers to workout at home with free weights.  It tones up your muscle enough so fat doesn't jiggle.,1193270400,,138,4.3076923076923075
2658950,3,B000ILYYUS,The workout was OK but Kathy needs to shut the heck up or at least tone it down a few levels. Motivating is one thing but she just goes too far. Do it with the sound OFF.,1193011200,,170,3.6216216216216215
2658951,5,B000ILYYUS,"I am 28 years old, had two children back to back and as a result MY BACK was giving out.  I had lost so much fitness and muscle during the 3 year period of having my children and I got this tape, along with some pilates and yoga dvd's to help me build back muscle and get strong.  I was walking a lot, and cardiovascularly I felt healthy but I needed MUSCLES.  I got this b/c it was broken into segments.  I find it easier to give 20-25 minutes vs having to have a full hour to devote to a workout (I do have two kids!).  This is one of those workouts where you can make it as advanced or as easy as you'd like.  Honestly, in the beginning, I didn't use ANY handweights because my own resistence was plenty.  Now, I'm using heavier weights, and with a combo of the yoga and pilates to help stretch and strengthen my core/back, and this video I feel so much better!!  I hope this helps, it can be quite tiring trying to find the 'right' workout.  Best of luck to you all!",1192579200,,970,4.063157894736842
2658952,5,B000ILYYUS,"This is exactly what I was looking for, straitforward workout that I can do at home to tone. She is okay, the annoying factor only goes up every once and awhile, but overall a great buy.",1192492800,,186,4.194444444444445
2658953,4,B000ILYYUS,"I am a big follower of Kathy Smith and have several of her workout DVDs.  This is a great workout with weights in a short amount of time and Kathy keeps it interesting as usual.  Unfortunately, I really didn't like the bonus stability ball workout.  The camera moves around too much and it is hard to follow.  There is so much movement that it makes you a bit dizzy watching it.  I think the intent was to make it look more artistic, but really it just ends up being a disappointment.  If you are going to buy this DVD, buy it for the workout with weights!",1192406400,,556,4.19811320754717

2658956,5,B000ILYYUS,"I have been using this tape for years.  When it broke, I bought the DVD.  I really like the upper body workout on this DVD.  Twice a week for 20 minutes and my arms really look great.  I feel great too!  It offers two programs, one harder than the other and you can choose the right one for your level.

I also purchased the Lift Weights To Lose Weight Volume 2 recently.  The upper body portion is much harder and more complicated, but my arms do look amazing when I use it.  I alternate between both volumes now.

If you are only buying one, get Volume 1.  I recommend this DVD for beginners as well as advanced exercisers because you control how hard  you want to work by adding more weight or by doing the harder program.",1187913600,,725,4.218978102189781
2658957,5,B000ILYYUS,I like this video for lightweight workout.  It really works all the muscle groups well and I like that it has segments so that you can pick shorter workouts if you have a time problem.,1183593600,,184,4.257142857142857

2658961,5,B000ILYYUS,"This workout hits about every spot on the body. The video is not very flashy, but it's easy to follow and she makes sure you do the exercises properly. If you are short on time, you can just work on one part of your body. If you have an hour, you can go through the whole thing.

And that is what I was looking for when I purchased this DVD.The DVD is easy enought for a beginner like myself and also shows a more advanced version also. I like the fact that there is a upper body and a lower body, which are separate. So if you don't have the time to do both, you can get one done in 20 minutes.

2658966,3,B000ILYYUS,"Although I plan to continue to do this workout from time to time as I'm sure it does provide a good, all-over body workout, I just really prefer other DVDs to this one. I don't like the format at all: when you're doing the arm segment, you can choose to either use lighter weights but do more repetitions or use heavier weights but do less repetitions, which is fine, except for the fact that the segments aren't split up, so you're told to just pay attention to one side of the room for one choice and the other side of the room for the other choice. And it's a similar format for the lower body segment. Although reading material will flash on the screen from time to time to remind the people using heavier weights etc to pick them up or put them down at certain times, I don't want to read while I'm working out. Both the upper & lower body segments should've then been split up into two separate selections based on whether the person chooses the heavier/lighter weight workout etc. Also, it often feels all over the place, going back & forth between using the chair & not. By the way, you'll need a sturdy chair too; not just any chair will do. Anyway, I prefer her ""Ultimate Sculpt"" and ""Power Walk for Weight Loss"" DVDs much better.

I have been doing this for 3 weeks, 5 days a week, and I see results already.  I love the 7 minute ab workout in the end, and I see results from that, too.

What's not so great are:

* her yelling; I've done this tape so many times now, I've noticed the embarrassed looks on the faces of the dozen people behind her.

* her counting is off...""OK, gimme 4 more right here..."" Then she does 2 more and switches to something else. Again, confused looks among the folks behind her.  This happens about 3 or 4 times.  I've gotten used to it and know to anticipate her off-counting.

* now this is just me...I get NO inspiration or connected feeling from seeing all the beautiful, hard bodies working out behind her. Some of them make the weirdest facial expressions when the camera's on them.  I'd be fine just having Kathy instruct by herself..again, just me.

And the moving all over the 'friggin' place as she is lifting---is also DISTRACTING and nerve racking to say the least.

I was never a fan of hers anyway but I needed a routine (and still do now) for a free weights program.

This...definitely (4 me that is...) isn't it.

2658985,5,B000ILYYUS,"I got this DVD with the goal to increase my toning options - previous to this I only had Denise Austin's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"", and this worked all sections of the body rather than having dedicated body part workouts.

I was pleased that this DVD comes equipped with individual workouts for the upper and lower body, and a short but effective abdominal routine.

Here's what you get:

1. 20min Upper Body Routine

2. 20min Lower Body Routine

3. 7min Abdominal & Back Routine

4. Some random babbling about improving posture

20MIN UPPER BODY ROUTINE - Being familiar with bicep curls, tricep extensions, lat pullovers, bench presses, overhead presses and in general all of the standard exercises that come with upper body strength training, I did wonder whether this workout would be challenging. I was pleased and not pleased at the same time to find that Kathy ensured enough variations and tweaks to work the muscle to the point of failure - pleased that my money had not been wasted, but not pleased because my arms are sore and useless the next day! Kathy demonstrates how to perform the exercises with proper form and maximum effectiveness, which is refreshing compared to Denise Austin - whom you often have to rely on the other exercisers to demonstrate how to perform the exercises safely. Kathy uses a bench in this workout, but you can easily substitute a chair or a stability ball to complete the workout just as effectively.

20MIN LOWER BODY ROUTINE - This might be difficult for those with knee problems, as Kathy relies heavily on squats and lunges, and while these are the most effective way to tone the lower body, they may not be in reach of everyone, so Pilates might be a better option for people with injuries. There are some glute exercises that require you to lean on a chair on your elbows, and I personally find this uncomfortable, and end up focusing more on my discomfort than on the exercise itself - so I use the kitchen bench or the dressing table to lean on instead.

7MIN ABDOMINAL AND BACK ROUTINE - 7 minutes, sure it isn't long, but its enough time to work your abdominals properly. Though for people who have problems doing situps/crunches, this might be a problem. At the moment I cannot do a situp properly, but even then I get a good enough workout from this short segment, but for others who are in a more severe state, you might want to consider the ""Winsor Pilates Ab Power Sculpting with Resistence"" routine, which provides modifiers for those with back & neck problems whilst still giving your abdominals a good working over in 15mins. Nonetheless, for those who can do a decent stomach crunch, this is effective and good value for 7 minutes of your day.

Kathy Smith has included the use of what she calls a 'dual track system' to give its users the option to work out with either lighter weights with more reptitions, or heavier weights with fewer repitions. Really, all the dual track system is is a series of on screen prompts to either pick up or put down weights and stretch out the muscle you are working. This way, rather than having different beginner/advanced routines, you have a single routine that you tweak depending on your preference for lighter/heavier weights.

Kathy is vibrant, charismatic and encouraging, without being too girly or mushy; though some people may find her suburban perkiness a tad annoying. I find it quite difficult to believe that people would find her personality to be such that it put them off the workout altogether - as per Denise Austin's workouts, where sometimes her mannerisms simply cannot be compromised; ""Tight tushies! Flat Tummies! No more jigglies!"" - Kathy has no 'catch phrases' as such, but does sometimes let out a ""OooOoooooWWWWWWW!"" as a representation of how the muscles are being worked. However, while I don't find her personality annoying, she certainly does quite a bit of shouting even though she has a microphone. This doesn't bother me, since I turn the volume down a bit, and I really am surprised that other people find it that big of a deal.

Be warned though, I started this workout only after being able to do the ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" toning workout, and the other 10 minute toning segments on Denise Austin's ""Get Fit Fast"", ""Personal Training System"" and ""Power Zone: Ultimate Metabolism Boosting"", which I believe are better for beginners. Someone who is just starting a toning routine will find the speed of the reps on this workout difficult, and the other toning workouts I mentioned (while there are probably others who could recommend others) encompass the needs of a beginner.

Another thing, this DVD does not come with a warmup, although Kathy advises that you do one. In her second LWTLW DVD, Kathy does include a separate warmup, so I guess someone is listening! Just go for a brisk walk for a few minutes beforehand - or if you have a 5min warmup from another DVD, then do that first, don't go doing this DVD cold.

Summary:

* Not for beginners.

* Good exercises for upper, lower and abdominal regions of the body

* KATHY YELLS QUITE LOUDLY but all you need to do is turn the volume down a bit.

* You need to warm yourself up.

Enjoy!",1150416000,,5190,4.708609271523179
2658986,5,B000ILYYUS,"Kathy's Smith's TIMESAVER: LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT is a fun, effective workout for all levels.  The workout is divided into three sections: a 20-minute upper body workout; a 20-minute lower body workout; and a 7-minute bonus abdominal workout.

Throughout the upper body workout, you use dumbbells to work your arms and back.  Other exercises include pushups and tricep dips.  The lower body workout consists mostly of squats and side and back leg kicks/lifts.  Finally, be prepared to do a number of different crunches during the ab section.

The nice thing about the upper- and lower-body workouts is that they can be as easy or as difficult as you like - just vary the weight of the dumbbells and ankle weights.  Each has two different ""Tracks"" you can follow, too.  The first track employs lighter weights and more repetitions, while the second uses heavier weights and allows for more frequent rests in which to recover.  Half the class follows along with each track, plus there are textual cues on the video to help you keep up with your track, so it's quite simple.

Although instructor Kathy Smith suggests that you do the workout every day, alternating between the lower- and upper-body segments (or do both on one day and then take the next off), I also do yoga, pilates, and Tae Bo, so I only do LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT about once a week.  Even so, I can already see a difference, particularly in my arms and shoulders.  I don't use especially heavy weights, either - just 3- and 5-pound dumbbells and 2-pound ankle weights.  I can really feel an ache in my muscles after the lower body segment, too.  Finally, the ab workout is a ""fun"" (relatively speaking) variation from what I'm used to.

Speaking of fun, I really like Kathy Smith's instructional style.  She's peppy and encouraging, but not to the point of annoyance (yes, I'm thinking of the wild-eyed Denise Austin here).  I have a number of Smith's workouts, and they're all above par.

EQUIPMENT NEEDED:

The upper body workout requires at least two pairs of dumbbells: a light-to-medium set and a second, heavier set.  During the workout, instructor Kathy Smith encourages you to alternate between the two.  A padded bench is optional.  If you don't have a bench, you can get down on a carpeted floor or mat instead, but I find that a bench helps me to keep proper form, so I just use my coffee table with a towel for padding.  However, you will need a chair for the tricep dips.

The lower body section requires a chair for support, and dumbbells and ankle weights may be used for a greater challenge.

The ab segment doesn't require any extra equipment, optional or otherwise - just a carpeted floor or exercise mat.

Enjoy the workout!",1147737600,,2718,4.717622080679406
2658987,3,B000ILYYUS,"I usually really love Kathy's great instruction/cueing and strict attention to form and own many of her workouts but I am not keen on this one.
Firstly the ""twist"" - it feels wrong for two reasons: 1) I don't think twisting from the waist while working your upper body with anything but the lightest of weights is safe and 2) if you want to go heavier (like for biceps) then you will find you are falling over as you are twisted around and standing on one foot.
All that being said, the rest of the weights workout is great and really hits where it should (especially the glutes and triceps work) - I just don't do the twisting from the waist bit.
The other negative is the ball section, the moves are difficult and bordering on dangerous unless you are in super shape.  It's filmed in 'artsy' black and white - but it is more black than white so I have a lot of trouble seeing what she is doing as her outfit and ball seem to meld together so you can't easily work out the movements.  The transitions between exercises are done too quickly - you don't get time to adjust yourself from one movement to the next and Kathy's usual great cueing is lacking here.  If you want a great ball workout, try Gunnar Peterson.
I prefer her Secrets To A Great Upper Body and Secrets To A Great Lower Body workouts to this one - most of the exercises in LWTLW2 are taken from Secrets anyway so you aren't really getting anything new with LWTLW2 except the ball and a more pilates type ab work (I still prefer the ab work in Secrets as it works all the muscles).
If you skip the ball work and don't do the twisting, this is a good workout.",1147219200,,1624,4.266233766233766

Upper body (20 mins), Lower body (20 mins) and a bonus 7 minute abs.  You can break it up over a couple days or do all at once.  I do the entire workout and it is a full, overall workout.  The workouts have 2 versions, light weight or heavy weights with different intervals for both.  I am working my way up to the heavy weights!  I am a Kathy Smith lover and highly recommend any of her videos.",1140480000,,563,3.955357142857143

2658990,3,B000ILYYUS,"First of all this tape will not help anyone lose weight any more than any other workout including some cardio, as well as strength and endurance training, so I found the name a bit misleading.

The workouts themselves (upper and lower body) are built on really basic strengthening and weight-lifting moves - i.e. military press, bicep curls, tricep curls, lots of squats, etc. If you need an absolute introduction to hand weight exercises or like that sort of clear, basic workout - this is good for that. I found it a bit too standard, eventhough I'm certainly no fitness expert myself.

Finally I found the music very loud and annoying, over which she often seemed to be yelping. That part was so distracting, I disliked the video immediately. On Part II of of her Lift Weights to Lose Weight, they seem to have toned down the music and she is in no way screeching any more.",1132444800,,876,4.608974358974359

Other tapes of Kathy's have really gotten on my nerves-- her suburban mom perkiness and standard ""Three more! Two more!"" cheers sort of drive me nuts.  This tape has a few moments of bubbley cheerleaderness where you want to hit the mute button, but you really can't beat this workout and for the most part Kathy is not too annoying.  There's a moment at the beginning of the arm workout that always makes me cringe, but other than that, she's a rather mellow version of herself.

I used the arm workout three times a week for three weeks before my wedding (where I wore a strapless dress) and was very pleased with the results!  The leg workout is not as challenging as I would have liked, but I think that's because I didn't use ankle weights (also, my legs are in pretty good shape since I run regularly).  For me, it worked best to go for a 4 mile run, then come home and do the 20 minutes of arms and the bonus 7 minutes of abs (which is also very effective, and Kathy is hardly annoying at all in the abs part).

Her demonstrations of the different moves are very clear and her verbal cuing is good, which is helpful for some of the exercises when you won't be able to see the screen.  I especially like this workout because it has a large number of moves that I haven't seen on other tapes - her standing upper body series is comprised almost entirely of variations on traditional free-weight moves.  Kathy also has a large supporting cast that she uses effectively to demonstrate variations to make the moves more or less challenging to suit your fitness level.

If you're new to weightlifting, this DVD will likely seem very challenging in the beginning so stick with light weights at first.  Don't be surprised if you're quite sore the day after you try this!  By starting small and building into heavier weights, this is a DVD that can serve your strength training needs for a long time to come.

*This DVD also comes with a stability ball workout, which as other reviewers have mentioned is very difficult to follow and the production levels are not up to the standard set by the rest of the DVD.  I've tried it a few times but there isn't enough cuing and demonstration for it to be useful as a workout.  Thankfully, the main portion of the DVD makes this more than worth the money.",1119830400,,1551,4.732342007434944
2659008,4,B000ILYYUS,"If you're looking for a challenging weight-based workout to add to your schedule, consider Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2 by Kathy Smith.

While the total workout flows well if you just push play, it's really six separate segments -- warm up, lower body 1, lower body 2, upper body 1, upper body 2, and abs -- that you can configure to meet your own needs.  I've found that focusing on lower body one day and upper body and abs the next works well; it gives you a quick, effective 20-minute workout, and gives your muscles time to recover (believe me, you will be sore when you first begin unless you're already in great shape).

Kathy takes the time to demonstrate proper form for each move -- so important to both avoiding injury and getting the greatest benefit from each exercise -- without bogging down the routine and leaving you standing.  To get the most from this workout, be sure to use weights that are heavy enough to challenge you, without having to strain.  I found that five-pounders were fine to start with, and were a bit much for a couple of the upper body moves.

I would give this DVD five stars if it weren't for two things:  the warm-up, and the bonus balance ball workout.  The warm-up segment is very ""aerobics class"" -- lots of stepping and swinging your arms around.  This type of exercise tends to make me feel like an oversized bird flapping her wings, but if you enjoy traditional aerobics, it won't be an issue for you.  Personally, I'd rather just do jumping jacks or jog in place.

The balance ball routine is very challenging -- very, very challenging.  Many of the positions are way too advanced for me at this point, and the workout moves along at a good clip without much discussion of proper form or modification of the exercises for those of us who aren't solid muscle from head to toe.  But if you're looking for a good workout for your core, and don't mind modifying on your own on the fly, do try the balance ball routine.  My abs were sore for days.

Give this weight-based workout a try -- you'll get results!",1118016000,,2051,4.475806451612903
2659009,4,B000ILYYUS,"This is a great addition to your workout library.  Weight lifting is so great because muscle mass burns calories more efficiently than flabbity flab, which means you burn calories just sitting around!  How fair is that?  Anyways, muscles get built in this dvd.  She's a little perky, but who wants a grumpy gouch or a silent starer?

Weight-bearing exercises are really important for women because those kinds of exercises build up your bone density.  Now, I'm one of those who doesn't want beefy muscles, but am predisposed towards osteoporosis.  I'm destined to lift weights, but I don't want to look like a side of beef.  I use 1.5 lb weights and sometimes 3 lb.  Kathy, here, she uses eights sometimes, and her arms look a tetch, er, muscle-y.

Whatever works for you.

What's interesting in particular about the upper body workouts is that she has you stand in a twist, forcing your body to fight for balance, which is all kinds of wonderful for your abs.

To lose weight, though, I really recommend you add a cardio workout for thirty to forty-five minutes a day for four or five days a week.

Enjoy!",1116115200,,1106,4.668393782383419
2659010,4,B000ILYYUS,"This DVD is great!  This DVD delivers on its promise of effective weight training in the least amount of time.

Workout summary:  The DVD starts out with a 7-minute warm-up, then follows with a squat series, a glute series, standing upper body, upper body floor, and ends with a 10-minute ab routine.  (There is also a 20-minute stability ball routine in the DVD's bonus feature section.)  The lower body routines total about 20 minutes, while the upper body routines make up another 20 minutes.

Workout effectiveness:  The squat and glute series are real killers, relying mainly on the overload principle where each leg is worked to the point of exhaustion - you are definitely going to feel it!  Kathy and her exercisers demonstrate good form, with lots of tips and pointers on ensuring proper execution, as well as modifications for beginners.  The upper body routines are a mixed bag, with the standing routine getting more of the kudos - the trunk rotation position does incorporate core/stability training while maintaining focus on shoulder and back work.  The floor routine, while great in design, suffers from scattered video work where it's not clear what modifications are recommended for beginners.  The ab routine is also pretty intense.

The stability ball routine is NOT for the beginner.  The movements are done at a relatively fast pace, with little explanation of positioning and form.  It would be very difficult for a beginner to execute the exercises safely and properly.  The latter exercises are in the intermediate to advanced range.  The videography is in black and white with a lot of angle changes. Plus, the setting is on a beach which has Kathy dealing with the additional balance challenge that a strong wind dishes out. (I would recommend the Stability Ball Workout for dummies for those new to this mode of exercise; or even the Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout).

DVD Production values:  The stretches are filmed in black and white - which is somewhat distracting.  The 'Design Your Own Workout' feature is a great convenience - wonderful for mixing up workouts.  The only nit in the menu is that it's not very clear that there is a 'next page' so that you can check out the rest of the special features. (It's the right-pointing arrow at the lower right hand of the screen.)

Overall, this is an excellent DVD to keep for those high-intensity but time-crunched days.  I highly recommend this one.",1111795200,,2431,4.921375921375922
2659011,5,B000ILYYUS,"The program is divided into two twenty-minute workouts, one for upper body and one for lower body, which you can do on alternating days or consecutively if you prefer.  There is also an abs/back workout of about 10 minutes at the end.

I wanted a weight workout to add to my 30-minute daily walk for a complete program.  This is perfect for me because alternating the upper and lower lifting on different days means my workout will be under an hour each day, making it something I can fit into my day and stick with.  I do the abs/back workout on the days I do lower body.

The best thing about this video is that it accommodates people of all strength levels, and I will be able to continue using this same video as I progress.  Two tracks run simultaneously, track 1 for beginners/intermediate, and track 2 for intermediate/advanced.  I was recovering from surgery, so I had to start the video on track 1 using no hand weights at all, just for range of motion.  I then moved up to 1 lb. weights, then to 3 & 5 lbs.  Kathy also gives tips during the workout of ways to make the exercises harder or easier depending on your strength.

The pace is fast moving and concentrated.  The fast pace helps me stick with the program.  Other videos I've become bored with due to the amount of ""down time"" during the workout.  Kathy doesn't stop.  She uses basic tried-and-true exercises, but it did take me a few times through to make sure I had the right form.  But I'd much rather take a few days to learn the routine, than have a slower routine that I would be very bored with later.

I think this is a program that I'll be able to stick with and benefit from for a long time.  The only thing about it that bothers me is that the music must have been inserted later, because not all the moves are on beat with the music, but most of them are.",1110758400,,1835,4.287790697674419
2659012,5,B000ILYYUS,"This is a great weight lifting video that offers exercises for your whole body. The upper body exercises are great and allow you to increase your intensity with larger weights as you get stronger. The only problem is the ab workout isn't hard enough. It offers more unique exercises, but they aren't very challenging. I would still recommend this tape. Plus,  Kathy isn't annoying, she's more low-key.",1109289600,,401,4.985074626865671
2659013,2,B000ILYYUS,"I really needed to add some variety to my weight workouts, so I thought this VHS would be a welcomed addition to ""Lift Weights...Volume 1.""  Personally, I prefer Volume 1; however, this is not a review of Volume 1...It's Volume 2, the VHS version.  I have and enjoy several of K.S.'s videos/DVD's.  This one has somewhat different exercises than Volume 1, which is obviously good, but Kathy just does not seem to be up to par physically as she usually is.  She does not appear to be in the best shape, her facial features are somewhat odd when she speaks, and she sometimes acts ""forced,"" ""winded,"" and ""unsteady.""  Personally, I find all of this distracting.  Additionally, it is distracting because the first half of video is ""lower"" body, the second half is ""upper"" body, and then as others have pointed out, there is a rather overdrawn, detailed abdomen section.  For me, it is my preference to work ""upper"" and ""lower"" body...yes, I can forward the tape and then rewind it to exercise in that order, but that is just a hassle!  Again, as mentioned, there is really not much stretching.  Between the ""lower"" and ""upper"" body sections, there is minute or two of a rather whimsical Kathy filmed in black and white perfoming the body stretches on a mat on a beach.

As for the exercises...the lower body section is not nearly as intense as on her Volume 1 video, but if one uses the heavy weights and leg weights, one will probably receive a good workout.  The same may be said for the upper body.  I do not know what the ""unique rotational twist"" is supposed to add to the standing upper body routines other than assisting one who has contortional aspirations, but again, if one uses the heaviest weights one can stand without hurting oneself, a good workout may occur.  There are probably eight people working out with Kathy, and there are options for the less advanced exerciser (doing the workout sitting/leaning on a chair and lighter weights), but quite frankly, while I find the video to do its job if done to the maximum, it is really not a very impressive workout.  I rotate the video with my other weight routine workouts, and it is my least favorite.  It seems to be put together quickly, the routines seem re-hashed, yet described as being ""more effective"" than previous routines, especially the upper body and the ""unique rotational twist"" explanation.  There really is not much of a variety of exercises regardless of the fact that it is supposed to be a ""quick"" routine.  With all of the fancy props, the avante garde black and white stretch segments, and the unique rotational twist, this tape is more hype than work.
To update this review, I have since purchased the combo DVD LW's Volume's One & Two.  The DVD version of Volume Two apparently has a bonus ""Stability Ball"" workout, which I found by accident!  After I found it, I lost it and could not find it again!  I don't know if there is a glitch in the DVD, but finding the bonus Stability Ball workout was a real pain.  The one time I managed to find it, I worked out to it, and it is filmed in black and white, and basically Kathy working out with the ball on that same beach where she was ""whimsically"" skipping around and stretching between routines.  The stability ball workout was okay, but I have not worked out to the routine enough to provide any review.",1108425600,,3337,4.601351351351352
2659014,4,B000ILYYUS,"this video is excellent the only draw back not enough stretching.

2659015,5,B000ILYYUS,"This DVD is broken down into 7 different 10 - 20 minute workouts. Two upper body, two lower body, abs, streching and a stability ball work out. This is strictly strengthing and toning, so if you're looking to work up a good sweat (like with cardio) this is not the workout for you. That being said, I like to do a 30 - 40 minute cardio routine (Crunch as some great DVDs for this) and then follow it with one of Kathy Smith's 10 minute sections. I have noticed a nice change in my shoulders, and I have increased my weights from 5 pounds each to 8 pounds each. The ab section offers some new exercises, other than the basic crunch/reverse crunch. Kathy says ""stick with it and you will get great abs like these guys (referring to the SUPER FIT assistants she has doing the exercises) in six weeks or less."" This, of course, is an exaggeration. Although I have seen a nice change in my abs, it would take the average person 6 years or more to get abs like the people on her DVD.

2659020,4,B000ILYYUS,"I exercise regularly, mainly Body Electric, Yoga, & Pilates. I wanted to ""rev"" up my workouts by adding more aerobics & fat burning weight routines. In other words, I needed to ""mix up"" & add variety to my workouts. This tape really does it. While yes, she does go a bit fast, & there's intro that one will eventually skip, if one has the patience to ""work into"" the routine, you'll catch on, adjust the levels, and end up doing a fantastic workout that will keep your workouts fresh & have your muscles thanking you! I agree that a ""bench"" in not really needed for some routines, but if you have one (and a chair), have everything set up and ready to use because this routine moves quickly.  This is a slickly produced product that gets the job done, and after working the routines several times, you may notice a few ""editing"" errors, which are overlooked easily and not a deterrent to the routines. Again, this is fast-paced & there really is no ""warm up"" involved.  I would suggest a bit of stretching before ""jumping"" into the routine, or ""warm up"" during her intro.  Also, as one becomes familiar with the routines, one can (and should) have all the necessary equiptment ready, because this routine goes quickly.  Beginners, go easy & split the routines; die hards, do both routines in one session unless time is a problem.

(Now I work out 5-6 days a week, and I crave it!) I started with the DVD from the weight loss program I was on, and did that for about 2 months until boredom set in.  Then I discovered Kathy Smith! Lift Weight to Lose Weight is the 5th Kathy Smith video I've purchased, and is already my favorite.  I love the programmable feature--one of my other DVD's was supposed to have that, and it didn't work.  I love the squat section, the glute section (OH MY WORD! The glute section!), the standing upper body section (she nearly kills me on the triceps part every time); I haven't tried the stability ball workout yet, so I don't really feel qualified to comment on that.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I finish this workout, I feel fantastic!

Kathy also moves too quickly from one exercise to the next without giving you any time to grab your weights. There is no warm-up included, though she advises you to do one. But what I found most irritating was Kathy constantly barking orders like a drill sergeant to the toned and buff men and women in the class: ""Okay, give me four more!"" and her frequent ""whoops."" Struck me as almost sado-masochistic.

2659031,4,B000ILYYUS,"i bought this tape after reading countless good reviews.
it consists of a good warm-up for about 4-5 mins then starts the legs and buns, at first Kathy shows how to do a squat properly, then moves to doing squats of all kinds for about 7 minutes, that was torture, I must admit, my butt and inner thighs just hurt! then the lunges and plies section started. and in the butt section, there was this new workout, and it consisted of: you hold yourself to a chair and lift one of your legs and lift up the butt, then you move your leg inward for an inner thigh workout, and that was a tough move!!
then did some lunges and back to the other side and do it all over again. Then there is a stretching section.
the upper body workout was 20 mins, i didn't quite get the balancing idea, tough it was though, i really liked this part with the shoulders and upper back, thats what really hurts!
the upper back workout consisted of doing your normal tricep exercises: holding your arm in an L shape and extend so the triceps get a workout, then while your arms are extended, lift up the arms to squeeze the upper back.
Now that was a challenge!! great move!
Then, you keep balancing with one leg and torso is slightly twisted, and do your basic bicep curls, lift arms to the sides for the shoulders, and some other moves, then do the other side, after that you start doing a section for the chest muscles!
(very important, we don't want sagging on the chest! gotta have strong chest muscles!!!!!!!)
then after about 20 minutes, you finish and there is a cooldown.
Then moves to the abs for 7 mins, it was pretty tough, because the moves are slow, and you have to concentrate to do them right.
When you finish with abs, there is a short abs cooldown, and voila there is the video.
This is a pretty good tape, except that there are too many lunges, i hate lunges! (so it lost 1 star) the lower body could have consisted of some other moves besides the most common ones as lunges and squats, which I know most of us just hate.
Then upper body was good, had some excellent new moves as I already mentioned.
The background people are much more pleasant than LWTLW, there are no annoying background people, the music is very upbeat.
Kathy is also not so cheery as on the first lift weights, as some people didn't care for.

2659039,5,B000ILYYUS,"I have been enjoying Kathy Smith's Volume 1 Lift Weights to Lose Weight for more than 2 years. Volume 2 has all of the same elements in a slower more intense format that has given me a new challenge. I was up to 8, 10 and 12 pound weights with the original workout and now have dropped back to 5, 8 and 10 pounds with the intensity of the new routines. The pace is relaxed but the results are great. This workout begins with a warm-up, which was missing from Volume 1 and continues with the lower body routines, the upper body, and finally the abdominals. Lots of stretching in between keeps you limber. I still love the 7 minute bonus abs from Volume 1, and will alternate between both routines. Each DVD is nearly an hour, but can be broken down into smaller increments and done on different days. It's great to have a new workout to enjoy.",1066262400,,842,4.30188679245283
2659040,5,B000ILYYUS,"My husband and I had finally found a workout routine that got our rears up off the couch, and that we could use together in Kathy Smith's Timesaver-Lift Weights To Lose Weight (Vol 1). For heavens sake, it's 20 short minutes.  20 minutes that has kicked our butts in to better shape in a hurry.  We are active, but far from fitness fanatics and don't live to workout.  However, we had to do something to improve our ever declining 40-something bodies.  We've stuck with it for a couple of months now, and are seeing and feeling fantastic results.  Feel stronger, more energetic, clothes fit better, etc.  We liked it because could choose our individual challenge level by choosing lighter or heavier hand/ankle weights.  No weird equipment needed.  We ordered Vol 2 as soon as it came out.  I've always respected Kathy Smith as a fitness instructor, but the howling and woo-hooing gets old quick.  I wished that she would just coach, and leave out the annoying sound effects.  My wish came true in this DVD.  She really shows her excellent coaching skills in this new workout. Suggest watching it in a ""learning"" mode first to learn the different moves and postures.  Great weight training with a (literal) twist.  Calming attitude, less reps, more intense moves, good instruction.  My legs are still trembling!  Be inspired, fellow couch potatoes,  it's only 20 minutes.",1066176000,,1371,4.865800865800866

But with this second volume, I was immediately impressed and happy with it.  It's become one of my favorite staples already.  In this volume, Kathy includes a warmup as well as an abs workout section.  The workout is broken down into two sections: first is the upper body with 10 minutes focused on squats and 10 minutes focused on glutes, second is the lower body with first 10 minutes standing leg work and the remaining 10 minutes done on the floor.  The people in class aren't annoyingly cheery and the videography is cut nicely.  There are even some inserts from Kathy where she demonstrates proper form to ensure an effective workout.  There are some new techniques here you will not find in other tapes, especially in the abs section.  Great for veriety and staving off boredom. One move I really liked is going down in a squat and then shifting to one leg and then raising squat back up.  I am an avid exerciser and this tape made me feel sore in areas I haven't been concentrating.  I liked Kathy Smith just fine before, but this tape made me a fan of hers now.

Both the upper and lower body segments (she works on your balance some during the lower body segment, it's great!) are 20 minutes, and if you want to warm up, you will have to do that on your own because she does not include it.

If you want motivation and want to have fun, then the yelling is for you.  I yell and repeat the same words she uses, because it makes my workout fun.  If you want to workout and you're not having fun, then why bother.  I know that the yelling keeps me motivated.

Of course you can use heavier weights as you build up to them.

True every now and then she would let out a ""WHEW"" but so what.  The same people that commented on this would have still been dissatisfied if she let out a grunt, a commonly done thing when you're lifting weights.  There was no warm up and I didn't expect one nor am I going to make a big deal about it.

No warm up, no emphasis on technique, no smooth transitions...please...don't buy this tape!  I purchased several videos for a well rounded workout targeting abs and aerobics(Denise Austin and Leslie Sansone), body sculpting (this ugly tape) and sheer fun aerobics (Richard Simmons) and by far, the best was on Denise Austin.
Anyone interested in buying a useless tape?",1043452800,,503,5.275
2659053,5,B000ILYYUS,"This workout is fast-paced yet easy to follow.  There are two tracks shown simultaneously so that beginners and more advanced exercisers can both see results and get a great workout.  The exercises are basic (push-ups, curls, crunches, etc.), but the order in which they're done is logical and shown with proper form.
The workout for the abs and the lower body are the best on here, and are highly effective.  The workout is tough, and every muscle group is used.
The upper arm workout is a bit much for a beginner to handle, if every set is followed, but can be done with lighter weights than are recommended.  I used both 2-pound and 5-pound weights to follow the workout and saw results within two weeks of doing the workout twice per week.
It also helps that the three workouts are in separate sections (upper body, lower body, and abs) so that you can use only one workout per day if desired.  And, after each workout, there are stretches that can be followed as well.",1039824000,,973,4.568965517241379
2659054,4,B000ILYYUS,"i bought this tape 2 weeks ago, and until yesterday i had time to do the tape. I decided to do the entire tape to see how it was, and at first i didn't know it was going to be so tough!
The tape has no warm-up, (and has 2 separate 20min each upper body and lower body) which is great after a quick aerobics workout, it starts with the back muscles, then goes to chest, arms and then shoulders, and ouch my biceps got the best workout!! they hurt!!!! and i only used 3lbs!!!!
One cool thing is that you use different weights for different muscles, ex. triceps use 3lbs while shoulders use 5lbs., also you can follow 2 different 'tracks' one with lighter weights with more repetitions and the other track with heavier weights and a break in between exercises for more variation with the workout.
The lower body section has mostly squats and leg lifts, and then changes to lunges, and then some butt exercises, then to inner thighs, and lower body hurts a lot!!!
There is just one thing that bugs me, is the people in the background are rather fakey...but that doesn't really matter much. Kathy is a great instructor, and the woow's and all the shouting she does, did not bother me at all!
But my most favorite thing is that it exercises the muscles right below the back of the neck for good posture, which is very important!!
I would recommend this tape, its definitely a good combination with my tae bo tapes; it incorporates the muscle toning that i need!
I only gave it 4 stars because you need a bench to do these exercises, and if u use a chair instead of the bench, u gotta switch the chair from one side to the other in some exercises, it is kind of annoying! (i would have given it 4 and a half though).",1039478400,,1709,4.3105590062111805

She also swings her weights a little bit.  Those negatives aside, I love this DVD because it has helped me get definition in my arms and lower body. It has also helped me lose weight, since strength training boosts metabolism.  The DVD has two methods, in which you can do light weights with higher reps or heavier weights with lower reps.  You can also opt do the lower body segment with or without weights.  Though I get bored with workout DVD's easily, I always use this DVD (mostly the upper body workout and bonus abs) on a regular basis in combination with my cardio workouts.  I've lost about 30lbs. since this past Spring (2002).  I started this DVD in May and gradually started from 4 lb. free weights progressing to 8 lb. weights over time.

2659056,5,B000ILYYUS,"Aside from her annoyingly perky voice in the early morning hours, this video is great!  Since you can increase weights as you get stronger, this video will grow with you.  The twenty minute workouts are challenging, don't require a lot of space and really help tone.
I have definitely noticed a difference in my arms and shoulders.  The Legs workout could stand some improving though.  Don't even bother with the bonus abs section.

Having a choice as to how hard you want to workout with weights is nice.  It was Kathy's whoo-hoos and 'encouraging words' that spoiled the workout for me.  I do understand that lots of folks do workout better with encouragement, but I think there's a fine line between encouraging and annoying.

2659061,4,B000ILYYUS,"This is a fabulous DVD! I really like Kathy Smith, but she tends too always talk to much in the beginning of her tapes. On the DVD, I can listen once and then skip right to the workout now every time and not listen to her talking.
Also, this is not really for people just starting out with weights. She has very litte instruction on technique, which can be dangerous for those just starting out. But for someone who pretty much knows HOW to do the exercises correctly, it's great!  The workouts are very fast and choreorgraphed nicely and easy to follow.  The workout is very challenging, I think, and I can tell this is going to help me lose weight and tone up.  The bonus ab track is really good, especially because she keeps mentioning to not fully release on the way down. When you don't ""fully"" release, you are constantly contracting your abs throughout the entire time, not just on the ""way up""
I bought a nice hand-weight set at Sports Authority and use those just fine. And the lower body workout doesn't require weights, so you can at least do something until you get some weights. I highly recommend this DVD for the more experienced person who is serious about starting a great training program at home!",1030320000,,1215,4.513636363636364
2659062,4,B000ILYYUS,"This is a good workout if you are a new exerciser, short on time, have a short attention span or just get bored easily. The key however is consistency. The workout can be used by persons of all fitness levels.  I saw quick results within the first six weeks of using this video.  I consider myself to be a intermediate to advanced exerciser and I workout daily often changing my routine every two to four weeks depending on my level of boredom, current fitness level and/or the intensity of the workout. Even after a couple of years after purching this video, I still occationally use it on days when my time is limited or when I am tired.  This is a good video to include in your workout library. Kathy Smith is an expert in her field and has been around for many years. Her videos are well cued and she successfully leads the exerciser through the video with limited confusion.",1027900800,,879,4.447204968944099
2659063,5,B000ILYYUS,"I have been a fan of Kathy Smith videos since the early 90's when I used her fat burning aerobic tape daily and lost 80 pounds. I've always used weights on my own but never knew too many ways to use them and then I found this video. I have been using the upper body portion for nearly a month and I am amazed at the difference in my arms (even after the first couple uses!) The 20 minutes goes by so quickly that I'm usually shocked when it's over. For individuals that have never used weights before, make sure you start only with 3 or 5 lbs and work your way up. What they don't tell you on the video package is that you're supposed to have a set of three different size weights and if you don't have a weight bench to lay on, you'll have to use the floor with a pillow under your back for one part(Kathy instructs this.) The two track system allows you to do more reps with lighter weights or less with heavier ones. One thing I love about Kathy Smith is that she is encouraging without being annoying. Granted, a few whoops and squeals make it on the video, but who wants to hear a whole video of ""you go girl, you can do it!"" Not me. After Kathy Smith, I won't try out anyone else!  I thought I would only use the upper portion part of the tape and one day decided to do the lower body.  All the moves are very easy and make for a very complete workout.  Like the upper body moves, I started seeing and feeling results.  If you want to define your calves, quads and even your butt, she has some simple ways to do that!  I'm impressed with the two portions of the video.",1026777600,,1574,4.080906148867314

It also seemed a bit repetitious even for a weight training workout.",1025827200,,356,4.666666666666667
2659065,4,B000ILYYUS,"I really like this video for the basic simple weight lifting moves done in the first 20 minute workout.  There is not a lot of warm up, but that's not a big deal since the kind of techniques you are doing are not that hardcore.  You really feel the burn in all of upper body muscles though.  I use this video mainly for the toning of upper body and arms.  The second workout is pretty good for the lower body, but nothing spectacular.  Both routines are great for timesavers and it's over before you know it.  As usual, Kathy is a little chatty, but it's better then getting yelled at or no sound at all!
I really saw results and even a little bit of a bicep formed!  You start at whatever weight level is good for you and the dual-track video lets you advance as you become stronger and start to use heavier weights.  You can follow whatever track you feel comfortable with.
I highly recommend this for anyone just starting out.  It is not to hard, but you feel it the next day and you know it is working!",1022025600,,1006,4.225130890052356

So this video is fine, but I don't have much to compare it to. I find that it get a good workout from this tape and that it *does* tone all of my muscles. It is divided into upper body, lower body and abs/back. I like how this video is divided. HOWEVER, Kathy is WAY over the top in this one. She is always yelping and hollering; I find that it distracts me more than motivates me. In addition to this, she often bounces around the set, ""coaching"", so don't look at her if you want to maintain good form, she will totally throw you off. She is a pro, and I'm really surprised that she wouldn't know better than this! After awhile I learned who to watch and I figured out for myself what to do, but no thanks to Kathy. To sum up, this is an effective video but it takes some time to get used to because Kathy is just all over the place.",1021334400,,959,4.079365079365079
2659067,5,B000ILYYUS,"When I first bought this video several years ago, I thought I would only use the upper body portion, as had given up hope on my lower body long ago.  However, I've since come to appreciate the value of lower body work, and I've held on to this tape, which is probably the oldest in my current collection.
This video contains a 20-minute upper boyd workout, 20-minute lower body workout, and 7 minute bonus abs section.  Kathy moves fairly quickly between the exercises, so it would be helpful to view the entire tape prior to your first workout to become familiarized with it. Also, her cuing is sometimes a little off--she seems to lose track of repetitions--but once you've done the tape a few times, it's easier to follow along.
Kathy uses a ""two-track"" system, which gives you the option of using either heavy weights, less repetitions or light weights, more repetitions. I usually alternate, and both ways are tough!  The upper body portion covers traditional exercises for back, biceps, triceps, and shoulders (in that order). The lower body section utilizes mostly standing moves to work inner and outer thighs and buttocks; it ends with just a few minutes of floor exercises on your back. Finally, the tape includes a ""bonus"" abs section at the end. Not only is this a fast, strong abs workout with a few unique moves thrown in, but also it includes several back exercises for additional strength and balance; you will definitely feel these moves in your abdominal area the next day.
Some other reviewers have commented that Kathy's style in this video is annoying, with lots of ""hooting and hollering."" I was prepared to be bothered by this as well, as I don't like overly peppy instructors such as Denise Austin.  Although Kathy's frequent woo-hoos did sound a bit silly at times, I found it easy enough to ignore.  Also, I appreciated the fact that only Kathy wore a mike, so there is no distracting background noise from her 10 participants.
Overall, I think this is an excellent workout which would be appropriate for anyone from advanced beginners to more advanced exercisers in need of a quick workout. The combination of short length, varied exercises, and adept instructor is bound to help increase your motivation level--it's worked for me!",1017964800,,2258,4.8545454545454545

It is easily executed in your home--no jumping around shaking cabinets, no broad swath of space to clear to move around, no step apparatus.  A piano bench makes a fine substitution for the gym version, or a chair works well, too. Unless you are familiar with Kathy Smith's communication style, you may be lost the first time around, trying to figure out which weights to use when--her cues tend to fly by. The simultaneous two track work out is a bit confusing at first, too. A word to beginners who don't possess a lot of upper body strength:  start with 2, 3 and 5 pound weights, and take it easy with those 5's.

The exercises are effective and you can really feel them, but I'm no fan of lunges, and they're are plenty of those. But, still, no pain, no gain.

2659075,5,B000ILYYUS,"This tape is effective and efficient.  As a chronically time-challenged stay-at-home mother of a one year old baby, I attempt to save time whenever and however I can without sacrificing the quality of the results.  The rigorous pace of the upper body workout keeps me from getting bored or losing focus and targets the muscles effectively. While I like the lower body segment, I don't find it particularly challenging.  I strongly suggest that users plan a warm-up session prior to diving into this workout, I usually start with a 30 minute session with a step bench.  I have worked out an average of 6X/week, including cardio and strength-training, for 15+ years, and I still derive a burn in my arms from this tape.  Kathy is a little too happy and peppy on this tape for my taste, but it is only a minor distraction once you get into the workout.",990662400,,849,4.633333333333334
2659076,4,B000ILYYUS,"A great tape for adding weight training to your exercise routine.
A caveat about equipment you'll need. I watched the intro and it said all you need to get started is a set of dumbbells and either a chair or a weight bench. I went w/ the bench. Then I got to the second workout, where they suggested ankle weights, and also the exercises required a straight-backed chair, which I did not have, as I bought the bench. Sigh! (If I did this over again, I'd skip the bench cause a chair will work just as well).
That said, these are two fast, fun workouts that produce results. The lower body, especially, seems to burn my legs up but then, maybe that's where I need the most work. The mercifully-short abs/back ""bonus"" workout is over before ya know it, which (if you hate abs work as much as I do) is a good thing. I can really feel a difference, though, so hey, it's working!
The background music is cheesy but fun, and Kathy's enthusiasm is infectious. If her motivational outbursts piss you off, you should really try to get in a more positive frame of mind when you work out, I think.
One final suggestion: try vigorously vaccuuming your workout space as your warmup. Five minutes, and you really warm up all the muscle groups. PLUS... you've cleaned your carpet. No sense in jogging in place for five minutes when you can vaccuum!!",987984000,,1334,4.471311475409836
2659077,3,B000ILYYUS,"The only thing I found irritating about this video was Smith herself. She is extremely loud and irritating. Just when you begin to really sweat she stops doing the exercise and tells you to continue while she walks around and ""coaches"". Personally, I do not find it very motivating when the star of the video doesn't do the workout with you. If you don't think Smith would irritate you or if you are a Smith fan you will probably like this video. Just remember to be careful and WARM-UP!! Enjoy :))",987292800,,498,4.483516483516484
2659078,4,B000ILYYUS,"This video has a lot going for it.  For one thing, you don't need any equipment other than hand weights and a chair to get started. (Those familiar with videos by ""the Firm"" will especially appreciate this.)  Additionally, the video provides lots of flexibililty.  Do upper body, lower body or both at varying levels of intensity.  This is all to the good.  My problem with the video is this:  don't call it a ""timesaver"" workout and say it can be done in 20 minutes when you don't include a warmup/cooldown.  The TAPE takes 20 minutes, but if you're warming up on your own, you need to add that to your exercise time. This may sound picky, but I think it matters when the tape is specifically titled to appeal to the time-crunched.  It's somewhat misleading.  Kathy Smith is a wonderful instructor and in great shape, although I'm not sure her chest is God-given, (a minor point, and probably none of my business, but I WAS thinking about it during some of the reps.)",983836800,,968,4.5491329479768785
2659079,5,B000ILYYUS,"I try a lot of exercise tapes and this is one of the best.  Kathy Smith offers an excellent, balanced workout.  The two twenty minute segments are nicely paced and offer an intense exercise experience.  I've been doing this for just a few weeks and I'm seeing good results already!  I feel more fit and definitely stronger.  The work is challenging but never too much and there is the option to take the easier or lighter course if it is too hard.  Get this and get fit!!",979430400,,471,4.35632183908046
2659080,4,B000ILYYUS,"Kathy Smith leads you through two separate 20 minute workouts, one for your upper body and one for your lower body, and there is a ""bonus"" 7-minute abs and back workout at the end. Kathy uses her ""dual track"" system, so that you can either use lighter weights and do more reps, or heavier weights with recovery time. Kathy is extremly peppy, as usual, which might annoy some people. Frankly, the workout keeps you so busy that you don't have time to think about it! You move from one exercise to the next very quickly, sometimes a bit too quickly. I like this video, though,  because you pack a lot into those 20 minutes--it's a great workout for working stiffs like me who really don't have much time to exercise.  Many of the exercises themselves are classic moves, like concentration curls, french press, tricep dips, side laterals, flys, lunges, plies, etc. Some of the moves are more unique, especially in the lower body section.  The abs section might be too short for some, or plenty for others depending on your level of fitness.  I like that she includes a couple of back exercises--we mustn't forget about our backs in our quest to have ""washboard"" abs. Kathy's cuing is mostly good, at times a little off beat, and once or twice she cues a little late.  I like the music, and it's at just the right volume relative to her voice. You will definitely see results if you use it regularly. All in all, a very good workout.",970444800,,1429,4.544747081712062
2659081,4,B000ILYYUS,"I recently began to incorporate weight training into my exercise program  and I decided to go with the tried and true - Kathy Smith.  Kathy helped me  lose weight with her aerobic videos and I felt that she would be just as  effective with the weight training.  The workout is divided into two 20  minute sections for upper and lower body workouts. Kathy gets right to the  point and doesn't talk you to death.  I could do without all the fake  smiling by the video participant's, but the workout itself is great. The  workout is applicable to first timers as well as those more advanced. I  highly recommend it.",959558400,,612,4.522935779816514
2659082,5,B000ILYYUS,"I love this tape.  I got it about six months ago and have been doing it about twice a week and I couldn't be happier with the results.  This tape will get your arms and legs in terrific shape (the ab program is a little  too short for me, frankly) if you do it faithfully, and the tape is so  enjoyable, that it's easy to do faithfully.  As she points out in the  video, building muscle helps you lose weight, and this video will help you  reach your goal.  As other reviewers have stated, she offers two tracks,  complete with guidance as to who should do what when, and recommends  beginning weights.  Her direction is terrific and the tape really flows.  She's energetic, without being overly peppy (as I find her in some other  videos).  Unlike a lot of other tapes, you don't waste time listening to  instruction, you are working out for the entire 40 minutes.  Kathy Smith  has split the tape into two 20 minute workouts (upper and lower body) which  is really helpful when you've got limited time to workout.
Bottom line,  Kathy Smith has designed a terrific workout tape that is easy to stick with  and will give you the results you want.",959299200,,1146,4.444444444444445
2659083,4,B000ILYYUS,"Kathy Smith's Dual Track system is very adaptable!  I started out with Track One using 12-oz. soup cans for weights.  When I got stronger I bought dumb-bells and ankle weights and graduated to Track Two.  After a few weeks  I felt stronger.  After a few months my husband complimented my ""buff""  figure and my clothes fit better.

This tape has no warm-up.  I start  with a cardio workout including stretching exercises, so another warm-up  and stretch would be a waste of time for me.  However, the tape does  include post-exercise stretching.  There are no ""dancey""  maneuvers to follow.  What a relief!  This tape is suitable for  coordination-challenged people like me.",954115200,,673,4.972727272727273
2659084,5,B000ILYYUS,"This is my first Kathy Smith video and I liked it. Its a little confusing at first with the two track system but its a very effective workout. If you're not feeling the burn after both sessions you need an advanced tape.  What I also like is the upper body and lower body segments separated. So  when I don't have time to do both I can still get a good workout. I like  Kathy Smith's enthuasium, she makes it fun. I also like that this workout  seems to challenge her too. So you know its a good workout because she  exercises everyday! Buy this tape and see results fast.",952732800,,572,4.2110091743119265
2659085,3,B000ILYYUS,"I have tried other series such as the Firm and others, but like Kathy's 20 minute approach.
This tape is definately for the intermediate person who knows the importance of warming up and stretching before and after.  If  you are familiar with other workouts and can warm up and stretch on your  own, this is a great addition to your collection.  It offers a quick  workout and a good sweat when you have no time.
I would not recommend  anyone to use this as their ONLY workout tape, but great for working mom's  like myself who need a quick routine to fit into your busy schedule.",947635200,,580,4.415094339622642

8146149,5,B000ILYYUS,"My favorite workout of all time. Very effective and efficient, even though the cuing can be a little sloppy at times and Kathy sounds occasionally like a drill sergeant.  Only 20 minutes for upper body, 20 for lower, but packs in a lot - it is fast paced but do-able and adjustable to your own fitness level.  I've tried many workouts, but this is the one that really did help me lose weight and gain strength - without a huge time commitment.  I feel like I'm 40, not 62. I do a 10 minute low impact high intensity interval training routine (not Kathy's), then Kathy's 20 minute upper body workout one day and alternate it with Kathy's 20-minute lower body plus the bonus abs routine the next day.  I do each workout twice a week, plus an aerobics workout.",1514073600,,757,4.424460431654676

The two 20 minute workouts on this cd are EXACTLY the same as The Rules of Fat Burning.  In fact, Rules has a lot more on it.  The workouts weren't even re-done- just lifted and put on this ""offering.""  I will probably not purchase anymore of Kathy's work.  I like it, but will not take the chance that I already have it.",1455494400,,440,4.105882352941176
