8337048,1,B001R0AYKI,"Some of the so-called movies being dished up in the cinema at the moment are cheap, nasty and downright boring. Some of the chippy, crappy stuff is an insult to people who pay for the film. Hey and that's you people out there reading this. You pay. Either through the turnstiles or by reading this or watching the movie on TV or buying the script. YOU PAY!

Now I am really concerned, not for my future because Hyland Kavalee and I have mapped that out, and that's private thank you very much! But I'm concerned for the cinema and the next crop of moviemaking PUPPETS! Yes, you ferret! Who have to try for 2 hours to act up a plot that has become boring and far-fetched from the good ol' spirit of Aussie comedy. I was born and spawned on this genre in Bay 13, selling and eating Dixie ice-creams, and then through guts and hard work, ran into this great profession.",1313452800,13,866,4.345679012345679
8337049,3,B001R0AYKI,"I am not a big fan of this type of movies, but I have to admit that in some parts I was laughing. I won't say that is the best movie in the market in this gender, but if you don't have much to do, watching this would help you pass the time by.

8337050,4,B001R0AYKI,"I have watched ""Going Down Under"" a couple times and it just gets better, skinny white dude loses his penis in a meat pie mincing accident, gets a transplant from a dead black porn star and now every time he gets an erection he faints (what isn't there to get???). From Donkey punch to rainbow lick - I repeat most lines from the movie on a daily basis. The soundtrack is ""Real Real Good"", I just love the B&S ball punch up and Jonno's friends, especially Shane (Paul W. He).

If your looking for a great party movie, this is the film to check out!",1261267200,,548,4.219047619047619
8337051,2,B001R0AYKI,"This is the most baffling 86 minutes committed to film.

The story of Jono (Ed Kavalee) having sex with a meat mincer and getting the penis of a porn star grafted on is somewhat lost amongst the many inexplicable subplots. None of which made sense or advanced the story in any way.

There's a series of scenes where Sammy Loora goes to the pie shop. I know that's his name because he gets his own title card and theme song each time he appears. He plays no part in the actual story. There are multiple 'self-amusement' scenes. They play no part in the actual story. Mandy (Jo from Big Brother Australia 2003) and Fiona (Aphrodite from Big Brother Australia 2004) have an in-depth discussion about the legality of the Iraq War as they wax each other, purely to set up a 'Bad Bush' joke. There's gratuitous nork action, jelly wrestling, bestiality, trannies and watersports. Jono's mum looks like a man and 28 Days (A band popular in the late 90s/early 2000s) appear onstage for roughly 5 seconds. During the credits we get treated to home-video footage of kangaroos in a zoo, Japanese schoolgirls cuddling a guy in a koala costume (he appears all through the movie not doing anything relevant at all), and Austen Tayshus chasing an emu (which was filmed without permission from the emu's owner).

Going Down Under is 86 minutes of utter bewilderment. There is no point whatsoever to this film.",1242086400,3,1392,4.69672131147541
