6268615,5,B00IKM5OTW,"I loved this film, for a variety of reasons.  Foremost, Jessica Lange is always amazing, no matter what role.  There's really no more you can say regarding her, because everything's she's in turns to gold.  Even ""Hush,"" a movie Jessica herself is rumored to have called ""a piece of ****,"" was enjoyable, simply because of her scene-stealing.  ""In Secret"" is another triumph for Ms. Lange.  I can't say Elizabeth Olsen should have been the lead, but we take what we can get as long as Jessica's on the screen.  As a side note, Oscar Isaac did an excellent job, and brought some needed eye candy to the film as well.",1400889600,4,614,4.536363636363636
6268616,5,B00IKM5OTW,"Why isn't this movie on everyone's lips? It's amazing. It's not like anything I've ever seen before. It's dark, emotional, and grips you by the heart and gut. It's hard to know at times whether to be appalled or thrilled. The book definitely gives more detail which makes the story hang together a bit better, but even without familiarity with the book, this does a fantastic job of seeing the world through the eyes and actions of people who are probably like no one you've ever encountered (thankfully).

The way it is shot, with such low light, gives a feel of authenticity and also highlights the contrast between the dark, drab existence inside the Raquin household and everywhere else. The scenes do a great job of showing Laurent's many sides so he is deeply disturbing, yet also understandable as well as Madame Raquin's horrid flaws, emotions (even when she can't talk!), and motivations. The writing, directing, and acting are brilliantly done. Watch it. It really is THAT good.",1400716800,25,988,4.880952380952381
6268617,5,B00IKM5OTW,"In Secret recalls a time when less was more and audiences were not inured to sex and violence as they are today. Yes the core idea of the protagonist marrying her cousin and then taking his best friend as her lover still has a ring of scandal but it is handled gently and sensitively in this film rather than cudgeling the audience with gratuitous baroque abandon.

The standout in the cast is Jessica Lange. Her career renaissance has been a pleasure to observe. She takes some big risks here and they pay off hugely. I am so surprised that her name did not come up in awards season. She should have been on someone's radar.

Oscar Issac is clearly a star on the rise and it show in his portrayal of the brutish Laurent. He is at turns desirable, deceitful, libertine and lover. Matched with Issac is Elizabeth Olsen whose luminous eyes could light the whole interior of Lange's drab shop. Olsen is a talented actress and serves the film well.

Lastly I must mention the supporting players. All are uniformly excellent and it is great to watch skilled character actors ply their craft with such dexterity.

See In Secret. It is a find.",1400630400,42,1136,4.553921568627451
6268618,5,B00IKM5OTW,"From its first frame onward, In Secret is a Gothic, hypnotic, often sexy, and at times disturbing story of people who, either by choice or because of fate, become imprisoned within negative circumstances and spin further and further out of control.  The film opens with a wayward father leaving his daughter, heroine Therese, at the isolated home of his sister and her ill son, Camille.  The aunt is portrayed by Jessica Lange with the regal and steely quality in which she now specializes and uses to steal scenes on the television hit American Horror Story.  Coming of age, Therese is forced to be at once best friend, guardian angel, and nurse to the wan Camille.  Later, she is forced also to be his wife on the eve of the family's move to Paris.  There, they purchase an out-of-the-way shop and reunite with a friendly past acquaintance, Laurent.  Artistic, confident, and masculine, Laurent is the antithesis of her husband.  He and the previously cold and sequestered Therese become clandestine lovers and plot to stay together at any price.

In Secret possesses every ingredient of a top-notch costume drama and erotic suspense film.  The performances are engaging and vibrant, which is no surprise since leads Elizabeth Olsen (as the adult Therese) and Oscar Isaac (as Laurent) are among the brightest talents of their generation.  She in particular perfectly captures the dynamic of her character, a woman who reveals menacing dimensions of her character out of justified desperation to escape her static domestic existence.  Each note of anger, desire, fear, and guilt rings true.  This authenticity reveals and animates a century-old story, scandalous in its day, for a jaded modern audience.  The production itself is gorgeous in its cobwebs and shadows and stones and general grit, with Hungary and Serbia standing in well for 19th-century France.  Call it seductive decay, never more so than during a delirious nocturnal visit to a slaughterhouse.  And the plot is rich and told with theatrical flair, from the way the character arcs complicate our initial understanding of each player to a spectacular ending which is haunting and, in a macabre way, satisfying in its ghastly inevitability.",1397260800,115,2206,5.105849582172702

6268846,4,B00IKM5OTW,"Therese ( Elizabeth Olsen) is not repressed sexually ; she has been suppressed and oppressed in all facets of her life by her intolerably rigid aunt, Madame Raquin ( Jessica Lange), in whose care her father left her as a child. She is forced to sleep beside her ailing first cousin Camille ( Tom Felton), who, like his namesake, wheezes and coughs all night. When she awakens into young womanhood, so does her libido, as depicted in an early scene, in which she, hidden in tall grass, watching a young man scything his field while stripped to the waist, is inducted into her first foray into ecstasy.  Loading on the oppression, Madame Raquin forces the marriage of Therese to her sickly cousin Camille. Soon after, enters  handsome, sexy Laurent (Oscar Isaac), a childhood friend, who has obviously come into his manhood.  The outcome is to be seen. The film is an adaptation of  Emile Zola's novel ""Therese Raquin."" Zola was the father of French Literary Naturalism (1860's), whose philosophy espouses a view of humankind as primitive and maintains the belief that people are driven by and will manifest their basest instincts.  And so they do here. The acting is solid, under the direction of Charlie Stratton. The costuming is excellent. The sense of time and place is skillfully achieved, as is the intrigue.

The characters are all stereotypes: the ghoulish aunt, the sickly son, the lecherous artist, and the masturbating orphan who is left by her father to spend time with her aunt and nephew and is assigned to sleep alongside her wheezing cousin.  The script is improbable.  After years of wheezing and being cared for by his mother and cousin, suddenly the nephew improves and moves from the country to take an office job in Paris.  The film gives us no infor as to how the nephew learned to do anything except to cough and be sick.  We do know that his orphan cousin has spent much time looking out of windows and masturbating in the grass when she sees a gleaner working the field.  The film ends with the orphan cousin and her artist lover killing the sickly nephew in a boat accident (none of which is shown onscreen) except through flash edits.  The writing really hurts this film.  You care about no one, and the film is totally lacking in suspense.  Zola's book is much, much better.",1464998400,,1056,4.544973544973545

This is just a really good film, if you like the type of movie that is about people and the stupid things they do and how they cope with the aftermath of their stupidity, you'll love this film.

Jessica Lange (Madam Raquin) part was great, especially when she fell ill.

Every aspect of the characters is fully explored, I think, and as their fates unravel, I found myself caring about them in ways that surprised me.  In Zola's world, apparently, there was no sunlight in Paris for anyone, and if the clouds had broken, the people in this novel would have fitted them securely back in the firmament again, on their way to the next compulsive transgression and classic denouement.

*Spoilers*

I personally believe that Therese and Laurent did love each other. This is made clear in the scene at the park, when Laurent has his head in Therese's lap, as well as the very end. The hatred that manifests later is primarily their self-hatred and guilt projected onto one another.

Imagine how these two feel so trapped, yet so unwilling to do something improper or offensive (by continuing the affair indefinitely or ending Therese's marriage), that they both agree that murder is the best option. That's a pretty stifling culture.

I was thrown off by Laurent's mention of money--especially because a shop-owning family would be considered middle-class, not wealthy--but I believe his guilt causes him to act irrationally, yet in accordance with this self-image of being a thoroughly evil person (Why show any restraint at this point?). Notice how he takes to heavy drinking and sleeping around--behaviors there were no signs of previously.

I had to laugh at one reviewer's claim that the sexual relationship was ridiculous. I agree that the two lovers were highly sexual, but they were pretty young, having an affair (which is inherently exciting, I'm sorry to say), and appeared to be getting together once a day. Not too weird in my book. Maybe in the context of the time, it seems shocking.

I will definitely read the story after having watched this.",1441756800,5,1441,4.983333333333333

Great characters, good acting, good pacing, interesting story, some erotic sex scenes, and good tension building.  The story made me want to slap some sense into the mother-in-law and first husband for how oblivious and insensitive they were.  Though I thought the story started to falter a little when the two people in the affair got married.  I'm not sure I believed their change in character.

I love Elizabeth Olsen.

This movie was dark and strange and different and it really held my attention as I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, and the end really shocked me.

Spoiler Alert..
This movie is about a man and woman who fall into lust with each other. She is married to her cousin, and he is the cousin's friend. They have wild urgent sex constantly, with the thrill of almost getting caught and doing it right under everyone's noses. They decide that they want to be together all of the time, and they suddenly decide to kill the husband who is in their way. They kill him and make it look like an accident and get away with it. So, now, they are free to be together all of the time. But suddenly their incredible lust is gone. The thrill of secretly sneaking around and almost getting caught is gone, so it isn't fun anymore. Ironically, it is suggested by others that they marry each other now (which they originally wanted, but suddenly, not so much anymore). They get married, and their wedding night is all about arguing over the guilt that they feel over the murder. Their super-strong lust never returns, and instead, their guilt gets stronger until they hate each other. By the end of the movie, they are so consumed with guilt and hate for each other and themselves that they both drink poison and just die in each other's arms, just at the moment that it has been discovered that they have committed murder and the police are coming to get them.",1419033600,3,1505,4.445652173913044

6270454,4,B00IKM5OTW,"I purchased this because I love period dramas but this is a very dark story. Set in France in the mid nineteenth century, a young girl Therese is sent to live with her aunt after her mother passes away. Her father promises to return but his ship goes down off the coast of Africa. Alone with little money in the Victorian world her controlling aunt Madame Raquin pushes her into a loveless marriage to her sickly cousin Camille. The family move to Paris where Camille takes a job as an office clerk and Madame Raquin purchases a small shop which they live above. Not long after Camille introduces Therese to his childhood friend Laurent and sparks fly! These two begin an illicit affair.

6270525,5,B00IKM5OTW,"4 1/2 STARS FOR AN UNDER REPRESENTED AUTHOR IN RECENT PERIOD CINEMA -- MOST WELL KNOWN OF THE LITERARY NATURALIST SCHOOL OF WRITING STYLE

THIS IS EMILE ZOLA, NOT THE AUSTEN... OR EVEN BRONTE THAT MANY ARE USED TO. (and I love these also)

Put away the pastels and forget about tea parties and gala balls. This beautifully shot, intelligent period piece deals more with depths and passions of the human heart than it does the pretty faade of the upper crust. This brooding tale is from Emile Zola, based on his first major novel Thrse Raquin. Zola's intent was to conduct a study of temperaments as he called it, not a character study or thriller. That does not make for great cinema so the movie departs in that the character development is quite exceptional, along with the acting bringing it to life. Some other modest, but significant, departures are made from Zola's work, but I will not give spoilers. There are beautiful shots of countryside, but mostly this movie trades bright scenes and happy drawing rooms we are used to for the sooty, grimy streets of lower class Paris in the 1860's. This movie has been billed as an erotic thriller. This is not really the case, but that grabs media attention. Zola considered himself a theatrical naturalist (so the more natural or broader range of emotion is appropriate here). Later it shows the more extreme results of one's actions. One might better call this a social criticism that was common of French writers of that day and the pessimism around the problems of the second and third French Republics.

THE PLOT: Little Therese is abandoned by her father into the hands of her aunt, Madame Raquin, and her sickly, overly mothered son. They are not particularly evil to her, but she is trapped in a life of servitude and complete lack of self determination. As she matures, the movie quickly establishes that she is a passionate young woman as she spies on a local farmer scything crops while shirtless. Not long after, Madame Raquin announces that Therese will marry her sickly and unappealing son who has just obtained employment in Paris. After all, it is a good result for a young lady with no family or prospects. Unfortunately, she has been raised pretty much as a sister to this sickly man who is, in fact, still her first cousin. The scene of their arrival in Paris is symbolic of her state as the camera shifts to a darkened street view to focus on her through a window of their shop with bars for protection, but bars none the less. Zola's work describes her environment as a tomb rather than a prison as seen in the movie. Therese is unsettled later by the appearance of her husband's friend and colleague from work who is also an artist. Of course she hates him, yet is drawn to him as a breath of fresh air to her prison of a life. He seduces her with subtle tales of his work posing models while he painted them, a nudge of the thigh, a touch of a brush. Everything comes to a head and simultaneously unravels as they realize their attraction.

Reception of this movie was mixed by both critics and audiences alike. Those looking for a pretty period drama were perhaps ambushed if they didn't do their research before watching. Those looking for the erotic thriller found something perhaps less titillating, shocking, or even that surprising. Rather, they found a more intelligent piece possessing depth and true emotion, but hard to interpret without context. Nonetheless, it was not what most people expected. Since it is a study, the point is not fantastic plot twists or shiny ornamentation.

First and foremost, Elizabeth Olsen brings an emotional range to a Victorian woman that is realistic and palpable, yet rarely portrayed in most of our cinema. Not to mention those unusual and lovely Olsen facial features that contrast the more traditional style cast in period drama. All the time she still manages to maintain the period character deftly while exuding that emotional range. The scene where she pretends to be a bear in bed to elicit a response from her husband was hilarious and adorable! He had just been explaining his fascination with the zoo and his walks there. Jessica Lang shows she still has tremendous moments of drama left in her career. This is one of her greatest recent works. Tom Felton as Therese's husband is transformed. He played an intentionally annoying, though maybe physical appealing, character in Harry Potter. Here it the opposite. In this more serious role, he is the persona of the weak, mothered, sickly husband who simply has no idea of how to make his wife happy. He is utterly physically and emotionally unappealing, but not a bad person at all.

If you knew this was Zola before watching, you probably knew what you were getting into. With those same expectations, choose it or avoid it based on what appeals to you. Those going into it with the right expectations will be richly rewarded. Though plays and operas have been made of Zola's work, I do not think they are easily translated into modern cinema. The fact they did it so well here is a testament to the writing, acting, and production values of this movie. I was not so much entertained as I really appreciated the piece. It is bleak, sensual, and emotional. There are only the slightest snippets of flesh, but plenty of sexual situations. If you are still interested, I suggest trying a rental first.",1403395200,6,5375,4.724946695095949

6270527,3,B00IKM5OTW,"What might have been a good character development film quickly dissolves into you, the viewer, watching as the main characters become willing victims of their own mental issues; or ""baggage.""  Jessica Lange is one of my favorite actors - authentic and believable in most films she has done.  This was different.  She and her son have almost an ""Oedipus"" relationship, and his murder triggers some horrific almost sic-fi type events.  The soft-porn was done well - the young wife of Jessica Lange's now dead son, feeling tricked into marriage and sorely lacking love in her life, is swept into a relationship with her husband's best friend.  But from that moment on the film story spirals down into a psychological study of murder and suicide??!!?? As the two young people lay by the river's edge in the throws of death - after drinking their intentionally poisoned wine, Jessica Lange (who has had a debilitating stroke) looks on - with her stroke-ravaged face in triumph at their death.  They had drowned her son, and she had her revenge - but to want advantage?  I do not recommend this film, unless you think you can make more sense of it than I did.",1403395200,,1153,4.735

Tired formulaic storyline of seafaring father leaving his daughter with wicked relatives while he ventures into hostile sailing; promises to return; of course, doesn't and daughter grows up more enslaved than loved; then forced to marry wicked family's uncouth son.

She spends her life in near isolation from the outside world as does her sickly cousin Camille (Tom Felton) who she eventually marries as she knows no other life. As her passions flair, missionary position Camille fails to satisfy her as she takes up with Laurent (Oscar Isaac) an old friend of the family.

Jessica Lange is the controlling factor, a mother who dotes on a sickly son, then finds herself saddled with an orphan. The son and the girl grow up together, and marry.

6270556,2,B00IKM5OTW,"**Contains Spoilers**

I can honestly classify it as the most depressing film I have seen in a long time.  The film is apparently based on a story by the name of Thrse Raquin,"" written in 1867 by Emile Zola.

In short, the movie is about a young girl, who after her mother dies, is placed with her aunt and her sick, coughing cousin. Jessica Lange plays a controlling mother (Madame Raquin), who orchestrates Therese's life at every turn. Her father passes away, and Therese is left with a small annuity. No doubt for her own financial gain, she insists that Therese marry her cousin. Unfortunately, he is not appealing in personality or looks, while she on the other hand is attracted to handsome men and deals with an uncontrollable sex drive.

When they relocate from the country to Paris, down a dark and dingy street to open a shop, Therese meets Laurent, a friend of the family. It doesn't take long for the two of them to fall into a lust-driven, sexual relationship that borders on the ridiculous as they meet in secret. Her domineering aunt has no idea that while she is tending the store below, her niece is copulating like a nymphomaniac upstairs in the room she shares with her son. Though you are led to believe it is love between the two, I frankly thought it bordered on physical obsession. Her lover knows how to control her need for him by pleasuring her at every turn, just as well as her aunt who manipulates her to do her bidding.

As far as Therese's husband, played by Tom Felton, he is a boring and idiotic man, and a mama's boy. His relationship with his mother is frankly as sickly as his health (cough, cough), as his mother dominates and coddles him into adulthood.

Laurent, as sexually driven as Therese, wants her all to himself. He suggests that they orchestrate an accident to do away with her husband. After all, accidents happen every day. Therese is hesitant to carry out the plan, but Laurent takes it to the end when the three of them go boating. He pushes her husband overboard, beats him with a paddle, and they watch him drown. Of course, they are dragged back to shore feigning a terrible boating accident wherein he loses his life. His body is recovered, buried, and no one is the wiser, except for one family friend who has her suspicions.

Of course, after the murder and time passes, Laurent and Therese marry and live together with Madame Raquin at the shop. Their relationship turns  sour very quickly, as guilt for murdering Camille and their debase personalities come to the forefront. In the meantime, Madame Raquin has a stroke, no doubt brought on by her excessive grief over her son's death, and is left unable to move or speak.  As she is confined to a wheelchair, she discovers through their yelling fights with one another that they murdered her son.

Well, where does this leave this sordid tale of dysfunctional family, adultery, lust, and whatever else you want to term it? It comes to an end where Therese and Laurent grow to hate each other so much they plot each other's demise. In the end, they both go mad as a hatter, and commit suicide in front of Madame Raquin, who finally obtains justice for her son's murder. The scene is no Romeo and Juliet moment, believe me. Instead, it is a sad commentary to two selfish people who committed a senseless murder that leads to no happy ending.

As far as performances, Jessica Lange, I thought carried the insatiable grief about her son's death to a psychotic level. Whether it was the intention of her performance to do so because or the script, I have no idea. However, I thought it felt excessive. Elizabeth Olsen's portrayal, as well as Oscar Isaac's, as the colliding lovers (definitely not star-crossed lovers), were well done conveying the characters' crazy drive for sex and ultimate demise due to guilt that borders on lunacy.

The setting overall, especially in Paris, is very dark and gloomy, which frankly mirrors the story. The  costumes were mid-Victorian era and dull in color for the most part.

6270558,2,B00IKM5OTW,"I usually love movies like this - period dramas with family secrets, intrigue and romance.  This film had an interesting beginning.  A young girl is left to live with a very controlling aunt who has a sick and pampered son.  She grows up learning to sit still and be quiet but she has a passion inside that she finds hard to control.  She ends up marrying her cousin and the whole family moves to Paris where she meets Laurent.  She and Laurent have an instant physical chemistry which quickly leads to an affair. Their longing to be together causes them to make a decision that alters everything.  It is at this point that the movie quickly became overly dramatic and truly boring.  I honestly stopped it once to see how much longer it had to play because I thought I'd been watching for well over two hours. The movie run time is a little less than 2 hours total.  It wasn't just one thing but more like the movie just fell apart about half way through.  The acting became wooden.

6270561,1,B00IKM5OTW,"This is the biggest load of tosh I've seen in years! A sullen, immoral, unethical bit of pornography that I unfortunately couldn't wait to see. Half this film is nothing more than graphic sexual escapades of Therese and Laurant, (played so badly by Olsen and Isaac, I wanted an abortion). LIZ OLSEN!! this woman's lack of acting chops fails to garner the slightest simpathy even though she tries to present remorse for her later choices, you just don't care; especially when one has Miss Lange eating up the screen with flawless ease, and true talent. Therese is restless and unsatisfied, and with absolutely zero self control; engages upon a lusty affair with Laurant. Camille, her husband played brilliantly by Tom Felton is murdered in act 2 (surprise, anyone?) by this adulterous woman and her lover...Stop! I can't go on.

There are two performances worth noting. Jessica Lang turns in an Oscar worthy performance. She does more with her eyes, than Olsen can muster on a dramatic midnight. And Tom Felton once again delivers the goods. But as usual, Felton is murdered half way thru. In fact, every film in which this lad has appeared since H.P. has seen his death brutally executed around the end of the first act. I would like to just one time see this underrated actor survive to the closing credits with some proof of life!
