8031695,4,B0002TT01O,"This is a cartoon of the Return of the Condor Heroes by Louis Cha. There's Cantonese and English audio, and English and Chinese subtitles. The English is a bit stilted, but my 5 and 7 year old kids don't mind. The English audio and subtitles don't match up entirely, so I turned off the subtitles. The English audio does include phrases like, ""sexual desire"" and ""bastard"" (in scenes with the taoist monks), so be warned. We've only watched a few episodes so far, but the kids are intrigued enough to want to watch the TVB versions later. I'm so happy to find an accessible English version of this Louis Cha series that I give it 4 stars. (There are very long intro scenes of the companies involved and warnings, and those can't be skipped, so it's best to watch each disc right through.) I borrowed the entire DVD series from my local library.",1496534400,,844,4.522875816993464
8031696,5,B0002TT01O,"This is based on Jin Yong's classic novel, ""Return of the Condor Hero,"" which is the second book series or sequel to ""Legend of Condor Hero"".  English titled it ""Legend of Condor Hero"" which is the name of the first book series.

Without reading or watching the first book or series may confuse many viewers watching this DVD series. This DVD series is about Yang Hong's son Yang Gor. Yang Gor's father died before he was born so he never knew how his father was like. His mother never told him about his father b/c his father was an awful power driven person. He had harmed innocent people and became a traitor to his country. Despite all he did, he loved his wife dearly. Yang Gor's mother died, due to depression, when he was at an early age leaving him to be cared by his father's ""brother"" (under heaven and not blood related), which Yang Gor called him Uncle. Uncle treat Yang Gor like a son but his(Uncle)'s wife was afraid Yang Gor will become like his father so she never taught him any martial arts, instead only educate him. Uncle has a daughter and 2 apprentices who always teased and picked on Yang Gor causing Uncle to bring Yang Gor to the Temple of Monks to study Monk's martial arts instead.

After Uncle left Yang Gor to the monks the monks mistreated him b/c Yang Gor is a traitor's son. They never taught him any moves and only required him to read the sacred books and do chores. Along the way he met a confused old man who insisted that Yang Gor call him Father in order for him to cure Yang Gor's poisoned hand, which he received from a mysterious woman. (From the 1st book: The Confused Old Man is actually 1 of the 5 greatest fighters among martial artists. His secret move is the Deep Frog Move. He had a biological son but was killed by Yang Hong, Yang Gor's father.)

The Confused Old Man now Yang Gor's Father teach Yang Gor the Deep Frog Move, thus this is Yang Gor's 1st ever learned martial art move.

During the monk's training day the monks called on Yang Gor (not knowing Y. Gor learned a special move) to battle out with an apprentice, expecting him to face a humiliation. The apprentice won and angered Y. Gor causing him to fight back. The monks disapproved him and threatened to punish him. Frightened, Y. Gor delivered the Deep Frog Move and injured / killing one of the monk. Other monks were extremely surprised and so threatened Y. Gor's life for delivering such a demonic move. Y. Gor ran for his life and ended up at the Mountain Cave where he met the Dragon Maiden for the second time. Ending Disc / Volume One.

This is just a summary of the 1st disc.

It is a shame they didn't create book one first which is about Yang Gor's biological father (Yang Hong), Uncle (Kwork Jing), and the 5 greatest martial artists. Hong and Jing were Heaven brothers but b/c Hong was too powered driven, he became Jing's enemy and a traitor to his country. There are total of 5 greatest martial artists.

1. (North) Fighter who is Jing's father-in-law

2. (South) Fighter who is Jing's master

3. (West) Fighter who is the Confused Old Man

4. (East?) A King who later gave up his position to be a monk.

5. A powerful monk who trains with the King

I find this a well develop storyline and a true classic. This is not like most Japanese anime you see. In most anime the main characters always starts out to be the ""one"" true savior without seeing their developments or the reason they are the savors. In this series, you will be able to see how Yang Gor becomes the ""one"" or how he developed into a great martial artist from scratch.

The flaw: Drawings of this series is not as excellent like the other anime. The sound quality is A-B average, some part sounded not too clear. The English voice actors are terrible. It is like they are reading from script in a High School Play; not really professional. I prefer the Chinese audio.

Despite the flaws, this series deserves 2 thumps up.",1132272000,,3916,4.411927877947296
8031697,5,B0002TT01O,"Wow incredible storyline...waiting eagerly for Vol. 2.  Dragon Girl is cool..got kind of a Lara Croft air to her.  Watch this is you can...I think it's Tai Seng's first anime.  They're pretty good with releasing all the best ""non Hollywood"" stuff out of Asia anyway.  Yang Gor is young but you can just see him brimming with potential...kind of like NEO from Matrix before he knew he was the one.",1097712000,,396,4.614285714285714
8031698,5,B0002TT01O,"LEGEND stays true to original animation will little to no use of CGI.  The story is thoughtful and sophisticated, based on Jin Yong's classic novel.  Honestly, I'm itching for the second volume to come out.  The characters are very dynamic AND the story doesn't drag...Yang Gor and Dragon Girl are thrown together almost immediately and immediately you can sense the involvement the two will have.  I usually look for new fight techniques in Anime and LEGEND doesn't disappoint (from what I've seen so far).  A lot of references to real Kung-Fu principles and tactics.  Excellent so far.  The end song is stunning.",1097712000,,614,4.96078431372549
8031699,4,B0002TT01O,"First off, the title is wrong.  This is the story of Yang Guo (Youka in Japanese) and is actually the second part to the Condor Trilogy and therefore should be titled as ""Return of the Condor Heroes.""  The error may be due in part to the fact that although the story and the publisher are of Chinese Origin, the animators are Japanese.

I would have given this (the entire series, not just this single DVD) 5 Stars if I had not been exposed to any Japanese animation and the Condor Trilogy Books and TVB series adopted from those books.  The story is good enough that it warrants this series getting a high mark, but poor animation (design, and actual animation - on par with something the United States would make for TV) and some inaccuracies make me take off a point.

For those of you already familiar with the series, this version is not even close to covering the story as much as the live series with either Andy Lau or Louis Koo.  It does cover the main part of the story quite close, but there are still some minor discrepancies such as the ""Beggar of the North"" having his pinky intact.  For those who are not familiar with the series, this is a good introduction to the Condor series and I highly recommend you watch it.  If you are used to a higher standard of animation, please don't be turned away by the poor design and choppy animation, because the story is the strong point of this series.",1096502400,3,1406,4.401544401544402
