8162806,5,B000LP6KUS,"Absolute gem of a documentary from a past age. Don't listen to those who quip that it is ""outdated"". It is made in a pure, non-sensational format so of course it feels ""out of touch"" with today's slick formats meant to dazzle. Everything from the music to the pieces selected are spot on. I would go so far to say that, in at least one point, possibly two, it is simply visionary. I think Mondrian would be pleased with the delicate and sensitive format how his art is portrayed. Great work Kultur! So sad to see where we are now, from what we once had in terms of documentaries ...",1521331200,,582,4.3
8162807,5,B000LP6KUS,"I'm an art teacher so when I teach artists, I am always looking for good reference books to use.  This is a good one...I  would recommend it for anyone who likes Mondrian's work and has an interest in him.  The book arrived in a most timely manner and in good condition.  Love AOL!",1393113600,,281,4.245283018867925
8162808,5,B000LP6KUS,"The DVD arrived pretty much on time so the seller rated a five star salute.
The DVD taught me how to pronounce ""Mondrian""  and it went beyond the
Mondrian paintings at the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, MI",1389312000,,212,4.435897435897436
8162809,3,B000LP6KUS,Was intending to share this film with my modern art history class but I don't think I will.  While I love Mondrian's work I thought the film footage was a little outdated.  I still enjoyed the movie and the content but visually I think I'd lose some students if I wanted to show this to a class.,1330732800,2,295,4.157894736842105
