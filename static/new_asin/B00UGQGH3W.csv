FILM FACT No. 1: Awards and Nominations: 1972 Academy Awards: Nominated: Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score for Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse and Walter Scharf. 1972 Golden Globes Awards: Nominated: Best Actor in a Motion Picture in a Comedy or Musical for Gene Wilder. 2014 National Film Preservation Board: Win: National Film Preservation Board.

FILM FACT No. 2: Principal photography commenced on 30th April, 1970, and ended on 19th November, 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Willy Wonka's factory; Mel Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke Mnchen (Emmy-Noether-Strae 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, which was only a set constructed for the film, was filmed at Quellenstrae in Munich, Bavaria. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Strae 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstrae, Munich. The closing sequence when the Wonkavator is flying above the factory is footage of Nrdlingen in Bavaria.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY [1971] was released to middling reviews and poor box office returns with just on a $4 million budget, and was actually considered somewhat of a total failure by many people during its initial cinema release. When it was re-released into cinemas in 1996, especially after gaining quite a nice following for many years, it made over 5 times its initial gross, pulling in $21 million.

Now, 45 years after its initial release, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is considered one of the greatest family films and musicals of all-time, and especially right up there with The Wizard of Oz, which many film critics compare it in terms of its cultural impact and historic relevance. Comic genius Gene Wilder plays the eccentric role of Willy Wonka, and the character Gene Wilder plays is a totally perfect and magical eccentric Willy Wonka which is definitely his best work and the one that Gene Wilder will be forever remembered for. On top of all that, Gene Wilders command of the character, his undying sarcastic wit and his interactions with the children of the cast, and especially his musical performances are an excellent example of his wide range and ability as an actor and to my mind Gene Wilder is the only owner of the role of Willy Wonka.

Though the film takes liberties with the Roald Dahl book, about the story of a mysterious, reclusive candy maker opening his factory to the five children lucky enough to find five much-coveted Golden Tickets hidden in the Willy Wonkas chocolate candy bars, along the films most memorable magical images and especially seeing Charlie Buckets four grandparents permanently stationed at the four corners of their shared bed; the chocolate river churned by waterfall; Augustus Gloop sucked into one of the transparent conduits, wacky names like Everlasting Gobstoppers, Oompa-Loompas, Fizzy Lifting Drinks, and gleefully punitive morality-tale sensibility makes this magical film so special.

On the other hand, here we find Gene Wilders detached and low-key take on the character of Willy Wonka, almost the antithesis of Roald Dahls hyperactive character as described in his book, especially where Roald Dahl likens Willy Wonka to ""a quick, clever old squirrel from the park,"" Gene Wilders character is more like an inscrutable, capricious cat, quietly self-amused, politely disdainful, seemingly friendly but with ready claws. In fact, Gene Wilders Willy Wonka character overtly embodies the Trickster archetype and a dimension of the character that isn't entirely absent in the book but is much less emphatic portrayed.

The film softens Roald Dahls story in some ways, especially where Charlie Bucket has a paper route and gets paid, a privilege beyond the wildest dreams of Roald Dahls poorer-than-dirt hero and sharpens it in other ways, with the stern scene in which Willy Wonka berates Charlie Bucket and throws him out of his study that has no parallel what so ever in the book. It also introduces a subplot in which Charlie Bucket and the other children are approached by a mysterious stranger who introduces himself as Willy Wonkas chief competitor and tries to entice them into stealing one of Willy Wonkas top-secret new chocolate candies.

As a musical, the film has two totally brilliant songs, ""The Candy Man"" and the ""Oompa Loompa Song,"" which is revisited several times throughout the film with different lyrics, and a few forgettable ones. Yet the casting is quite good, and the performances apart from Willy Wonka aside are all fine. Peter Ostrum, who never made another film, is the lovely Charlie Bucket, and Jack Albertson is splendid as Grandpa Joe. Among the supporting cast, Julie Dawn Cole in particular as the quintessential spoiled brat Veruca Salt; who is the one characterization from the first film that outshines her counterpart from the Tim Burton film. Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is one of the greatest characters of any family film and is definitely one of the greatest magical family films ever.

The biggest thing with the film WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is the impact that it has had on just about any child born a few years before and any year after 1971. Everyone knows the songs, the Oompa Loompas, the chocolate, and the terrifying acid trip that takes place midway through the magical fantasy film and traumatised generations of unsuspecting children, who never tell their own children and watch in delight as their children cry in terror. But all in all it is a totally magical journey into pure imagination of totally Scrumdidilyuptious Pro-Confectionary Factory of Fun, especially for all age groups!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video has once again brought us something really special with this stunning 1080p Technicolor encoded image and an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio that looks perfect for this film. WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY looks totally brilliant on this Blu-ray disc considering the film was released in 1971.  I was very impressed with the transfer and there is a lot more really good sharpness to this transfer than the previous release on the inferior DVD, but that also makes the special effects even more apparent. Flesh tones vary alightly throughout the film which really isn't as bad as it sounds since there are a variety of different skin tones present and of course the orange colour of the Oompa Loompas faces. Black levels are very good and solid throughout the film. For a film this old and filmed on the film stock available at the time, this is probably the best we will ever get to see the film in and it is definitely good enough for me and it is definitely Scrumdidilyuptious!

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video brings us this Blu-ray with an equally stunning 5.1 DolbyTrueHD Master Audio sound mix, and is a vast improvement over the previous inferior DVD release. As someone who loves all of the songs, its great to hear them all sound so much better and much clearer. The films dialogue is clear and consistent and I liked that the rear speakers assisted with adding some subtle directionality and emphasising some over the top sound effects. This isn't the equivalent of todays fully immersive mixes, but for a musical from 1971, this sound pretty good for its age!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by the Wonka Kids: Here with this exclusive audio commentary track we are introduced to the five golden ticket winners from the film, who were Julie Dawn Cole [Veruca Salt], Peter Ostrum [Charlie Bucket], Paris Themmen [Mike Teavee], Michael Bllner [Augustus Gloop] and Denise Nickerson [Violet Beauregarde] and we are informed that it is about 30 years since they have all met up together in the same room watching the film together. This is a totally and delicious fun audio track, filled with laughter and vivid memories of the production. They discuss their cast mates and what they are up to, and recognise their shortcomings in life in general, who also recall their crushes, and share things that fans have said to them over the many years since the film was released in 1971. Julie Dawn Cole informs us that she has a very rare recording of Anthony Newley singing the song Candy Man and apparently wanted to play the part of the candy shop owner singing the actual song, but was talked out of appearing in the film. We find out that the Willy Wonka Factory was in fact the Munich Gas Works located in Stadtwerke Mnchen (Emmy-Noether-Strae 10). When we see the children in the classroom, they talk in general about certain children and what they do in real life and who their Parents were. We find out that Julie Dawn Cole and Denise Nickerson had a big crush on Peter Ostrum while filming and now finds out for real in the audio commentary recording session and do not find out if he was embarrassed or not. When we see in the film Paris Themmen [Mike Teavee] being interviewed with his Parents about getting the Golden Ticket, but is more interested in watching the Television and playing with his toy gun, and wanting a real Colt 45 gun for his birthday, and his Father mentions, Not until you're 12 son, well we are told that scene took at least 45 takes as the Father character kept fluffing his lines and the last take is what you see in the film. The scene where the five children with the golden ticket first meet Willy Wonka at the factory gate, well Julie Dawn Cole informs us that the coat she was wearing was real mink, which of course would not happen if it was filmed today, but when they eat in the canteen and had to leave to shoot some scenes, Julie Dawn Cole left the mink coat behind and got a good telling off for doing something so very silly. One thing I noticed a great deal is that Michael Bllner [Augustus Gloop] hardly makes any comments and when we see him fall in the river of chocolate and gets sucked up the tube, we are told after that scene he left the studio and never saw any more filming, and only saw the rest of the film after it was released and again while sitting in with the audio commentary. When we see Veruca Salt running amok in the room with the golden eggs, Julie Dawn Cole informs us that scene took 36 takes, for different reasons. One thing that the Americans kept going on about is when they kept hearing the words Nit Wit being said and could not understand what it meant, well of course us true Brits know exactly what it means, in that it is a typical British sarcastic word meaning that persona is being a totally stupid idiot and cannot understand why Julie Dawn Cole did not explain what it meant to the Americans in the recording studio. We hear once very nice anecdote that Peter Ostrum and Gene Wilder had a nice regular habit every day after lunch where they would regularly share a bar of chocolate while walking back to the set. When you see Charlie Bucket and Grandpa Joe get into the WONKAVATOR, well Peter Ostrum informs us that this was near the end of filming and that peter tells us that was a 5 month shoot for him and because he was so young he found it was a totally exhausting experience and was eager to get back home to America. Also after filming Peter was offered a three picture deal, but turned them down, because he felt he needed to pursue other outlets, especially regarding work related pursuits for the rest of his life and had no regrets in turning them down. As we come to the end of the film and the credits roll up the screen, they all mention seeing their names, but when it comes to Michael Bllners name, he points out they had spelt it wrong, as it appears as Michael Bollner. Then right at the very end credits they are say thank you for watching the film with them all and also thank us for sticking with them to the very end, then finally someone shouts out, Got any gum? This has got to be one of the first audio commentaries to really keep you entertained and definitely held my interest throughout the audio commentary whilst watching the film again and it remains one of the most memorable audio commentaries I have ever heard. Definitely a 5 star rating.

Special Feature: Pure Imagination: The Story of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [30:25] Here we have a short retrospective documentary on the making of the cult classic of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. I learned a great deal of interesting and fascinating trivia from this just over 30 minute bonus feature. The film was made in Munich, Germany and the producer didn't want the scenery to look like anyplace the audiences might recognise, because they wanted a place ""you couldn't peg for any time nor any place and a totally fantasy place,"" and that is why they chose this castle-like complex in Munich. Producer David Wolper said they got $3 million by a company to release the film the same time a new chocolate candy bar was being introduced on the market: Wonka Bar, so they also changed the title from author Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" to ""WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY because of the chocolate candy bar's name and as they say, You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours. Gene Wilder said he wouldn't do the role if he couldn't make an entrance with a cane and limping, looking like he was crippled and then he would do a somersault and from that point, people wouldn't know if he was telling the truth or not which is the way he thought people should view the character Willy Wonka. Also we find out from Gene Wilder that when you see him drinking out of the little yellow cup and then you see him bite a piece out of it, in fact this was made out of wax and Gene had to be seen to eat it, but when the camera stopped filming he immediately spits it out. It was also fun to see in this documentary little Charlie Bucket [Peter Ostrum] who has of course now grown-up, and is now a much older adult with a big moustache. In addition, we get to see what the other grotesque children who appeared in the film now look like. This was great fun to see a grown-up Augustus Gloop [Michael Bllner] who still looks very fat and oh so gross, also Veruca Salt [Julie Dawn Cole] who is now a beautiful woman and now has children of her own, also Violet Buregard [Denise Nickerson] who is now a grown up adult with a family and Mike Teavee [Paris Themmen] who as you will see is now bald and later on in this short documentary, we find out what the actors are doing today. There were lots of comments by director Mel Stuart, who you can see really enjoys talking about his film. One of the keys to the success of the film, according to Mel Stuart, was Harper Goff, the art designer ""who had an incredible imagination."" After watching this documentary feature, I have even more new respect for the genius that is Gene Wilder, who comes across as an extremely nice guy, who is also a very low key compassionate man who was very good with the children in this brilliant magical film. Gene Wilder says, ""You have no idea how many people have come up to me over the years and commented on this movie,"" and ""You might think a lot, but it's more than that and yes, it's a wonderful legacy."" All in all this is very good stuff. Contributors include Mel Stuart [Director], David L.

Special Feature: The Moviemakers [Vintage 1971 Featurette] [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:02] This original short special feature focuses on what happened behind-the-scene on the making of the film WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Especially looking at the Art Director Harper Goff who came up with the fantastic ideas for the fantastic magical Chocolate factory, where we see him organising all aspects towards the film set. Harper Goff was also the Art Director for the films 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea [1954] and Fantastic Voyage [1966]. We also get the voice overs of actor Gene Wilder and director Mel Stuart and talk about their involvement with the film. Despite being typical promotional stuff, it is still very interesting nonetheless.

Special Feature: Four scrumptious Sing-Along Songs [1971] [480i/1080p] [1.33:1/1.85:1] [9:03] Here you have the option of having a joyous sing-along songs with ""I've Got a Golden Ticket;"" ""Pure Imagination;"" ""I Want It Now"" and ""Oompa-Loompa-Doompa-De-Do"" songs from the film. As usual you have the choice to either play them separately in picking out your all-time favourite song or Play All. You also get the words appear at the bottom of the screen like a karaoke, so you can sing along with the actors on the screen. One thing I do not understand is why the first three songs are in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but the fourth sing-along song is taken from the actual film and shown in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, but what you do not get to see is the wording along the bottom of the screen, very strange.

Theatrical Trailer [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:11] This is the Original Theatrical Film Trailer for WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. What a shame it was not shown in its proper 1.85:1 aspect ratio, but despite this, it is still a great presentation, but what a shame the quality of the print was atrocious.

BONUS: Stunning Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook packaging that features a 39-page book filled with brilliant written items such as ADULTS AS THE ENEMY: Roald Dahls Secret Recipe. In-depth look at the actors GENE WILDER; PETER OSTRUM; MEL STUART and ROALD DAHL. You get the song lyrics to the following songs The Candy Man; Ive Got a Golden Ticket; Oompa-Loompa Song #1; Oompa-Loompa Song #2; Oompa-Loompa Song #3; Oompa-Loompa Song #4. A look behind the film with THE GOLDEN TICKET TO A DREAM COME TRUE. Plus lots of stunning colourful photos.

Finally, as we remember reflect on the brilliant genius that is Gene Wilder, it is important to revisit some of his greatest roles and introduce the next generation to his work. There is absolutely no better way starting point than with the film WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, which is simply a timeless classic. So much so, that the Library of Congress deemed it culturally significant enough to catalogue it with the highest honour any film can earn in my mind. Words cannot truly express how this film has impacted on me personally, but even now, after not having seen it for years, I find no trouble sitting down to a complete viewing enjoyment and especially enjoying it as much as I did the first-time around. WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a film deserving of all of the highest scores available, and if you are looking for a way to remember the great Gene Wilder, look no further; this is your golden ticket to an enjoyable fantasy ride to world of chocolate. This film is simply the perfect package and it is truly a world of pure imagination. Highly Recommended!
