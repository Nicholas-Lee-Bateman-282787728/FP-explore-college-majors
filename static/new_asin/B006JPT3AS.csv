8499753,5,B006JPT3AS,"Though it's a documentary, it feels like a well told story, replete with well developed characters, fantastic scenery and an adventurous journey fraught with very real danger and high stakes. The peek into the lives of Tibetan families and their relationship with the gentle monks is poignant and uplifting. There are powerfully uplifting moments and rare insights into one of the world's most peaceful cultures. The children are so admirable, and quite lovable. Very highly recommended.",1446940800,,487,5.421052631578948

8499755,5,B006JPT3AS,"Every child in American should watch this movie. And so should every parent. It gives an invaluable perspective on the lifestyle and opportunities we have because we were raised in America, truly the land of opportunity. Beyond that, it shows the incredible love parents have for their children and the sacrifices they are willing to make to help their children live better lives. How brave the children are! How brave the parents! You will be lost in this DVD and remember it always.",1405987200,,484,4.843373493975903
8499756,5,B006JPT3AS,"This is a very well crafted, interesting and beautiful film. I organize a film festival event, for a high powered and intelligent audience. Nearly every person who saw this film commented on the degree to which they had been moved by it, and on the overall quality of filmmaking.",1405814400,,279,4.714285714285714
8499757,5,B006JPT3AS,"This thought-provoking documentary shows a true tale of striving and sacrifice; it will alternately make you smile, cheer, and weep. The suggestion by another reviewer that the filmmaker should just whip out his wallet and save the world shows a complete misunderstanding of the role of the documentarian: it is to tell a truth ---which may be uncomfortable or inconvenient--- that can change the way we think about things. That the film crew made this journey alongside the people from Zanskar while hauling cameras and other heavy gear shows their willingness to break from their own comfort zone in order to raise the consciousness of viewers to the challenges and hardships that many in the world face every day; for that, I commend them. If it distresses you to see how a difficult problem could be solved with a little money, then please donate to a worthy organization ...  or to a documentarian so he or she can tell a story that just may save some lives in the future.",1405814400,,977,4.747058823529412
8499758,5,B006JPT3AS,"I loved the film.

Some of the previous reviews imply that the families and children in this film were manipulated by the filmmakers in order to make a good story. As a long-time acquaintance of the producer and director, Frederick Marx, I have some familiarity with the making of the film and would like to address the concerns these critics express.

As the film makes clear, the monks chose to walk for multiple reasons:

* To save money, which was very scarce

* Because they thought it would be SAFER than driving

* So the fathers could accompany the children

* Historically, walking is the main way people have traveled to and from Zanskar. It's as natural to them to walk this route as it is for us to get on the interstate and drive.

Later, they decide to take the more dangerous driving route because conditions prevented them from getting through on foot. They also borrowed against money they didn't have to make bus travel possible. Was it a mistake to not choose this route initially? Possibly. Watch the film and decide for yourself. Personally, their reasons made sense to me.

The scene of the children being left at the school is indeed gut-wrenching. This is the very difficult price the parents are willing to pay in order to give their children a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The parents are fully aware of this price. The monks talked it over with them, and the parents made their own decisions. The fact that they were willing to go through with this painful separation is a testament to how much preserving their culture means to those parents.

When the children meet the Dalai Lama, it is pure projection to say they are not happy. I would say they are star-struck, and not quite sure what to make of the situation. Their faces are marked with ointment because they're actually in the process of being healed from the scrapes, bruises, wind, cold, and sunburns not just from the journey, but which they live with every day in Zanskar.

One critic implied that the film crew easily could have whipped out cell phones and called in helicopters. Not true. The film was shot on a bare-bones budget and involved considerable sacrifice and hardship on the part of the crew. The entire crew, by the way, consisted of just the producer himself and one other person during the trek, and the producer alone for the rest of the film.
They were there simply to document what happened.  They did not instigate this journey, did not make decisions for the families or manipulate them in any way.

To me, the 8.5 rating on IMDB and the 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes seems about right.",1404950400,4,2600,4.6652078774617065
8499759,1,B006JPT3AS,"Let's see what we have here: Two monks make a promise to their leader, the Dalai Lama. To please him, they go out to find enough poor children and their families to exploit, uproot and traumatize under the guise of being a Bodhisativa and this is sold as an uplifting, inspiring story by many countries and peoples who looked the other way or participated in the demise of many other cultures, traditions and long standing ethnic groups in countries they exploited. Ridiculous!

The actions taken by these monks are selfish and egotistic. Uprooting 17 children ages 4-12 yrs. and promising their loving parents that it is in their children's best interest. Were the poor parents made to feel ashamed that they couldn't provide a good education or good future for their children? That they then had to go along with supposed wiser beings who were operating under the supposed wisest being, the Dalai Lama and let their innocent children be subjected to horrific, terrorizing conditions, be uprooted from people who love them so they can keep alive a culture, language and religious practices that the monks and Dalai Lama want kept alive?

Hey, have you heard about writing a book? The Dalai Lama has written many.

Many cultures around the world have faced this dilemma and challenge from industrialization encroachment. Many who fight this are looked at and treated as rebels. Is fighting it more holy or spiritual or loving because it's done in the name of the religious figure, the Dalai Lama? That idea hasn't sold for other religious figures attempting to preserve their traditions, religions, beliefs, practices, why in this case?

Many religious leaders have supported many crazy, hurtful actions be done on children in the name of preserving or spreading religious beliefs. It doesn't matter who they are, it's damaging, hurtful, cruel and unacceptable. Beliefs, traditions, etc. are not more important than the emotional, spiritual, mental, physical well-being of children. We adults could be their loving guides not tormentors.

If these monks wanted to please their leader, do it without terrorizing or traumatizing children and shattering family connections. These weren't wise Bodhisativa choices in my very strong opinion, but ego choices out of two monks desire to please their leader.",1356652800,,2300,5.1554959785522785
8499760,1,B006JPT3AS,"The film claims to show two monks selfless desire to help poor children from Zanskar get a good education and preserve their culture.  But this movie is not about selflessness.  It is a story of ego and manipulation of poor families who only want some opportunity for their children.
  The monks offer to take the children to receive an education at a far distant monastio school.  BUT, instead of taking a bus to the town where the school is situated (which is what they do in the end)--they attempt to take small children on a 180 mile walking trip across Himalayan mountain passes in October, exposing them to altitude sickness, freezing conditions, 20-30 mile daily walks, risk of injury or even death.  This makes for great film footage, but it is tantamount to child abuse.
  And the journey by foot isn't done out of necessity.  It's done with a full crew of cameramen filming the whole experience.  Later, when they are unable to complete the walk and must return to their starting point, THEN they somehow are able to come up with the money to take the trip by bus.
  When they arrive, the children are left at a school and the scene of their frantic crying as they are abandonned there by their parents is gut-wrenching.
  At the end of the documentary, these children are brought before the Dalai Lama to receive his blessing.  NONE of the children appear at all happy at that time and many of their faces appear scraped and bruised.  This is not at all an uplifting story.",1356134400,,1484,4.585551330798479
8499761,5,B006JPT3AS,"A breathtaking experience - there is no other way to say it.  This is a true story - a documentary - about the effort of a Buddhist monk under the auspices of the Dalai Lama to bring some children out of the poorest region of old Tibet and bring them to a Buddhist school. The problem is that they have to climb some of the highest mountains in the world to do it. And so the children, the monks, and some buddhist nuns on a pilgrimage begin the perilous journey.  There is no guarantee that anyone will survive. The effort of these children, one as young as four years old, to climb these mountains is awe-inspiring. The need for education is critical - or else they will lead an entire life in poverty and ignorance.

Anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism must see this.  The perils, escapes, and hardship of the journey are humbling. The soundtrack is wonderful and can be purchased separately from ""Amazon.""  I gave that soundtrack as a gift to a scholar of Eastern Religions and it was his favorite Christmas gift.",1326585600,8,1019,4.516304347826087
