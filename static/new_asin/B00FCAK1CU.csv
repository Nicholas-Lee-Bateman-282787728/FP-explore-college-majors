If you want to sound melodic all over the neck and learn beautiful arpeggios and a sense of chord tones, this is a killer dvd. This is so melodic, even Robbie's voice is melodic. I have some of his other stuff, the guy is a great teacher, very relaxed and chops to die for!! So why only 4 stars? I am not a pro, not even close. But I do know some about modes. To me, many make it rocket science, and it really isn't at all. But certain modes have a certain sound that gives you different feelings in a song. Take Am, well it's Cmajor, same notes. But, take Stairway to Heaven. There is not 1 doubt that song has a minor sound, even though it is the same exact notes as Cmajor. And there is my problem with this dvd. Where are the modal sounds that make each mode a different vibe? I have never heard a Phrygian song sound  happy and melodic? Maybe I am a headbanger or a newb, but I have studied modes some, from other teachers on Truefire, and they blow this away for that info. Maybe Robbie only sees half the modal picture? Still worth its time for absolutely beautiful melodic playing",1497916800,,1158,4.169642857142857
