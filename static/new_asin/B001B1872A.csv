terror train is one of those violent, ""halloween"" type of films that jamie lee curtis did. it's pretty good and representative of the style of horror movies at that time.

""candyman"" didn't make much sense to me. i don't think the name has anything to do with the story or character.",1469232000,,326,4.508474576271187

8280956,5,B001B1872A,"These 3 horror films are highly watchable and very frightening!

The Fog: 8.5/10
This is now one of my favorite horror films. Starring scream queens Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis, this film follows a city under attack by a mysterious fog containing death and murder. I thought this was amazing. The lead actress Adrianne Barbeau does an amazing job as the local radio host trying to save the town. While there's not much blood, it is very scary.

Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh: 6/10
This was the weakest of the bunch. In my opinion this was not horror. It follows a young art teacher who realizes a disturbing fact about her family that involves the Candyman. Half of it is a slasher and then the rest a romance-kidnapping-thriller. The 2 leads do a great job however some weak acting from the female police officer. Overall, a bit disappointed however a worthy sequel. It was also very gory so be warned.

Terror Train: 7/10
This one may not be the most original but it is one of the best. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, it follows Alana and her friends who 3 years after a horrible prank take aboard a masquerade party on a moving train. There they are picked off one by one. This one had a very nice murder tactic which involved changing into the victims costumes. The killer is obvious however there is a very good twist involved. The violence was brief however the aftermath was gory and doesn't shy away from blood.
So there you have it. This is a very good collection of horror films that do not disappoint. Also these come in separate, professionally labelled discs so Kudos for that!",1404000000,3,1595,4.56993006993007
