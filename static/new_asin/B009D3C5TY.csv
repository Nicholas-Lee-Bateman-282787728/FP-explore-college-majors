8539844,5,B009D3C5TY,Another great indoor cycling DVD. I feel as if I'm riding along the countryside and get a great workout to boot! You have the option of guided or not and the workout is easily adaptable for whatever ability. Definitely a great alternative when outside weather doesn't allow for biking outdoors.,1482019200,,294,4.9
8539845,3,B009D3C5TY,"I was really excited about this based on the reviews and the sample video I watched on Virtual Active's website.  Sadly, my husband and I both found the sudden cuts from scene to scene disconcerting.  Just as we'd start to get into the ride, enjoying the road or path, the scene would shift to the next one.  For example, we'd see the camera approaching a tunnel and be excited about going in, only to suddenly end up somewhere on the other side without the enjoyment of that particular experience.  The scenes would sometimes change as often as every few minutes, and each time it did it would take us away from the feeling that we were cycling in Italy and dump us back in our own living room on our exercise equipment going nowhere.

If you find long stretches of a journey boring, or if you want just the best highlights of Northern Italy, this DVD is perfect for you because the scenery was varied and incredibly beautiful.  For us, however, we'd rather enjoy the journey from start to finish seamlessly, and will search for DVD's that offer that.  Suggestions would be most welcome!",1470614400,,1088,4.577319587628866
8539846,5,B009D3C5TY,I love this workout!  I'm new to spinning and this is my first experience on a stationary bike but this DVD makes it so much more fun! I feel as if I'm cycling in Italy!  The workout is a challenge (I'm a little out of shape) but I think no matter your shape you can decide how hard to work yourself - you can choose either a 30 or 60 minute workout and guided or not guided. The scenery is gorgeous and the music helps to keep the pace. I will definitely be purchasing more virtual DVD's from Indoor Cycling!,1457136000,,509,4.08

8539849,5,B009D3C5TY,"Amazing product... outstanding, like all the other Virtual Active cycling DVD's I've purchased.",1408579200,,95,6.384615384615385
8539850,5,B009D3C5TY,"This is the best indoor spinning workout.  Scenery is great.  Instructions are top notch.  The whole time you are moving on the roads or trails unlike other stupid cycling videos where you sometimes see the riders coming toward you and the rest of the time you have to stare at their butts.  This is a great virtual workout.  It's just you on the ride listening to Jim Karanas teach you.  This video got me into spinning.  I love it and you will too.  Other websites brag about their cycling workouts, but they don't even approach the quality of this one.  I have looked for ones like this one so I know what is out there.  I am ordering the other 3 that Jim Karanas does.",1393545600,5,672,4.304
8539851,5,B009D3C5TY,"I am relatively new to indoor cycling and have bouth several videos to try them out. Hands down, this is the best out there. The views, music and guidance is spot on. I like the menu option to do either a 30 min or a 60 min workout. Also, the candence icon on the top left side is a godsent. This is the primary video in my spinning repertoire.",1390521600,3,344,4.0
8539852,4,B009D3C5TY,Well-paced indoor cycling video.  Good for riding while listening to audiobook. Great visual cues. Scenery would be better in high definition.,1389571200,,142,5.761904761904762
8539853,5,B009D3C5TY,"Between my husband and I, we have purchased ALL of Virtual Actives Cycling DVDs.  My husband has a indoor trainer and I run on my treadmill.  And though there are running DVDs available, I find the cycling videos just as useful for treadmill workouts.  We get 2-for-1 with these..... I run while my husband bikes on his trainer.

WHY WE LIKE:
1) Absolutely gorgeous scenery.  I have not purchased any other ""brand"", but have viewed many on Youtube or their websites and in my opinion, these are the absolute best.  No shaky helmet cam videos or watching a fellow biker's butt for a stretch.  I don't think I could stand watching a spin class either.  These are the real deal---- like you're really there.

2) Good training and form tips for my husband on the trainer.  I'm not a biker, but my husband says he's learned a lot.  I do use them in my runs when they say to relax, get your breathing under control---it helps the runs go better.

3) Interesting facts about the locations you're ""biking/running"" in.  This helps the time go by, and has firmed up some of our vacation plans.  I want to visit these places!!

4) Workouts are 35 minutes or 1 hour.  The new series that just came out are 35 and 55.  We use the 30-35 minute workouts during the work week and do the longer workouts on the weekends when we're off.  Also the workouts are designed in 5 minute blocks.  Even though you might be tired, you think, ""Well, I guess I can go 5 minutes longer.""  And you do.  My 26 year old daughter was shocked when I said I run 50 minutes on the treadmill. She said she can only last 20 minutes due to boredom.  I have NEVER been bored with these videos, but staring at the wall or watching the news....THAT would be boring!

5) These videos will make you work hard.  My husband said prior to these workouts that he just went through the motions while watching TV.  Now, he has a trainer pushing him to go harder and he has seen great gains in his fitness level.  He's planning to do some races this coming summer, and I think he'll do well.  I see how hard he works on the trainer. The beauty of these DVDs is you have two options: Guided or Basic. The guided workouts include instruction from a personal trainer, and the basic workouts allow you work at your own pace and enjoy the scenery. And like I said, the scenery is top-notch!

6) Did I mention these are the best thing to happen to cycling and treadmill workouts?  I do have an IFIT, but prefer these.  While I like the data I can get from IFIT, I personally think ""kinks"" need to be worked out of their programs. I am currently tracking my progress on paper.

WHAT WE DON'T LIKE ABOUT THESE DVDS:
I can't think of a single thing.

My husband & I love these DVDs.  Virtual Actives is coming out with another series this year (Patagonia-Chile, Argentine, don't remember what else).  As soon as I know they're available, we will be buying. If you run or bike indoors, I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in these workouts.",1388534400,4,2987,4.370909090909091
