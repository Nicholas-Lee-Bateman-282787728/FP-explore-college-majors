192835,5,157362408X,"Dead Alive is one of my favorite horror films of all time, definitely in my top 5. I never got into Jackson's stuff big after this, but Dead Alive stands the test of time for me. It's so crazy, so over the top, and so shocking that it just works. In the film, a rare Sumatran Rat Monkey is brought to the local zoo, which bites the overprotective mother of a mama's boy in a turn of events. Her condition deteriorates rapidly, and he does everything he can to hide the truth from everybody else. Blood flows, limbs fly, a killer baby rolls down a hill in a carriage, this movie has it all! The effects are fantastic and plentiful and the comedy works with the repulsive bits to hit it out of the park every single time. Did I mention I love this movie?",1507075200,,752,4.1931034482758625

192844,5,157362408X,"The best zombie movie ever made. Return of the Living Dead is great, and is totally iconic, but I would rather watch Dead Alive (or Braindead, as it was originally dubbed by Peter Jackson). This movie is a riot. A zombaby is formed from the unholy union of a zombie priest and a zombie nurse, doing the nasty. A bum cheers on a man who is giving a righteous and very public beating to the aforementioned zombaby. A man takes an upturned lawnmower to a room full of zombies, and turns them into the largest meat salad you've ever seen. This movie is terribly funny, gory as a butcher's shop, and I love it. My friends and I used to rent it about once a month for years, back in the 90's. An original and legit zombie gorefest.",1475366400,,725,4.260869565217392

Witty, blood letting galore, it is a rollercoaster of puke, self cannibalism, limb ripping, monkey biting, Freudian mothers from hell film. Very sharply written, with one liners for the ages, and a priest who ""kicks ass for the Lord!!!"" Do not hesitate to watch an early example of Peter Jackson's genius.

192902,5,157362408X,Dead alive is an amazing mix of gore and comedy brought to you by Peter Jackson. It has overly gory blood and guts scenes but presented in a comedic fashion. Not much for special features but a clearer audio than the DVD. And it being the uncensored cut it makes you love zombie movies like you never thought you could. It starts out quick and keeps up the pace never becoming monotonous like some in the genre. Before investing the money for blu-ray either rent on DVD or digital download.

192922,5,157362408X,"From today's most critically acclaimed director, Peter Jackson, responsible for the blockbuster hits derived from the Tolkien, namely, the Lord of the Rings (the third instalment, The Return of the King, of which won 12 Academy Awards, featuring ground breaking CGI from special effects team, Weta Digital) and Hobbiit trilogy, comes Jackson's first attempt at movie making - resulting in the goriest and funniest horror masterpiece, Dead Alive (aka Brain Dead); the story of which revolves around a mother's boy (who is constantly under the domineering control of his mother) experiencing a chance encounter with the daughter of a grocery shop owner, whose wife is a gypsy who foretold of their daughter becoming romantically entangled with the former, finding himself being pursued by and falling for the grocery shop owner's daughter, much to the displeasure of his mother - who while spying on them on a date to the zoo, is bitten by a rat monkey, and, consequentially, transforms into an uncontrollable flesh eating zombie, who, subsequently infects a nurse, punk gangster, and a priest (the mother of whom, having been kept alive, through an undying act of filial piety) are resurrected from the grave in which they were buried after the girl manages to convince him that they should be put to rest, and having mistakenly injected them with animal stimulant under the mistaken impression that it was poison (which transforms them into hyper active zombies), finds his mother infecting a group of his uncle's friends, during a party being held at the house he had inherited (wrestled from him through an act of blackmail by his uncle - who threatened to expose the fact that he was keeping zombies in his home), leading to a deadly and successful attempt by him to kill the zombies, who, had, by now, infected and killed all and sundry with the exception of him and his girlfriend, resulting in a final confrontation between him and his mother; and, successfully killing his mother, leading to his final emancipation from his overbearing mother - in a movie that pokes fun at filial piety and Christianity.

Highly recommended.",1413331200,,2132,5.039660056657223
192923,4,157362408X,"Dead Alive (1992)
 This would be a solid three brain flicker even if it wasn't written and directed by the now mega-star director Peter Jackson.  Jackson had his start in film making by directing splatter films.  Dead Alive aka Brain Dead was his third feature length film.  He filmed it over an 11 week period for a reputed $3 million US.  It went on to make $1.9 million at the box office and of course more from DVD sales over the decades.  He gave it a great, simple and direct title.  We get it at once.  Dead are alive.
 They must have use a thousand gallons of tomato puree to make this film.  In the later scenes the actors are literally slogging through red gore and assorted body parts.  Its finale is a lengthily voyage into the absurd.  The plot stops having any connective tissue and becomes an excuse for the young film makers to throw any visual trick that they can come up with into the mix.  Jackson and his cohorts have a lot of imagination.
 And when they ran out of imagination they ripped off visual takes from Evil Dead, the 1981 Sam Raimi masterpiece.
 If gallons and gallons of gore do not put you off, and why would it, there is a lot of very good stuff in this one.  (A reported 300 liters of movie blood is the reported total used in the climatic scene.  You get the idea.) Timothy Blane is the reluctant hero who is teamed with a young girl played by Diana Penalver. Blane went on to have a career that continues to this day with many film, TV and live stage credits.  Spanish actress Penalver also has had a long and successful career in the Spanish film industry.  Both are really very good.  This was Blanes first film.  Penalver plays a girl just ready to find her lifes love and romantically attaches herself to Blane.  Never mind that his mom has turned into a Zombie.
 In a clever twist on what to do with a Zombie, the son stashes his mom and subsequent Zombies in the cellar and injects them with heavy duty tranquilizers.  This turns out not to be long term solution.
 The excellent direction, mostly clever writing and always good acting puts Dead Alive well above the stagger of the horde Zombie flick.  And it is way fun to see what a young Peter Jackson could do with a small budget.
 The Sumatran Rat Monkey, the nexus of the infection, pops up in the pop culture from time to time.  Spanish actress has a line in the film, Your mother ate my dog. which is used for the Spanish language title for the film.  In Sweden movie goers were provided with barf bags.
 The film garnered 13 international awards including five from it's native New Zealand and the prestigious Saturn award.
 Jackson cast himself in a cameo as a helper to the undertaker.  I like that.
 There are other versions out there with as much as 10 minutes of bloody carnage snipped out.  This might make the film better.  I found the nonstop gore fest a bit trying.",1412121600,,2874,4.378787878787879

It is now so high due to the Hobbit movies being release at this time. The same for Blue ray. If you like this movie, you may want to give the movie ""Bad Taste"" a try... Lots of gory fun. This was Peter Jacksons first movie which he made with his buddy's from his work place from their post office.

Wow, where to begin.  The gore in this movie is so over the top it's hysterical.  It beats the ridiculousness of Evil Dead levels of gore. It employs a similar gross out slapstick style complete with hilarious scenes involving a zombie baby and animate gastric system.  With memorable characters such as a priest who ""kicks ass for the Lord"" and more gore than you can shake a mop at believe me it gets messy! The transfer isn't that good (but hey it takes up less space than a VHS) and gives it a grind-house feel.  All in all worthy addition  for horror fans and gore-hounds alike. 10/10",1386374400,,632,4.557522123893805

192947,5,157362408X,"Hilarious.  Audacious.  And very very messy, I loved it the first time I watched it, I loved it even more the second time (but they only have a five star rating system here).  This movie is paced like a boulder tearing down a mountain, picking up speed, decimating everything in its path, until it reaches its glorious climax at an impromptu party given at the home of poor simple Lionel (Timothy Balme) and his almost dead Mum (Elizabeth Moody), courtesy of Lionel's evil Uncle Les.  This party makes ""bedlam"" appear sedate and prissy by comparison.

Favorite scene, Lionel taking the baby zombie to the park to play.  That, and poor Lionel trying to glue Mum's face in time for dinner guests.  What's a meal without pudding?

Forget everything else Peter Jackson's done, this is his masterpiece.",1383004800,3,797,4.8088235294117645

It contains many bloody and gruesome scenes. The mix of extreme violence and comedy may not suitable for everybody.

The special effects look obviously fake most of the time probably because this movie had a shoestring budget and it was made 20 years ago.

More than one scene where I couldn't believe they did THAT. Highly recommended, docked one star because one part towards the end does fly with me. Someone is clearly bitten and infected, then they're fine. If a reason was given, I missed it (as did others watching it with me).

The monkey bites our main character Lionel's mother and she is crazy,she killed his father & lied to him. She gets bit and turns into a zombie then her son Lionel has to keep her and the plague in the basement. Things get out of hand super fast. This is a splatter-fest. It reminds me of my younger days as a little kid watching the zombie movies with my mother. So years later when i remembered this awesome movie i just had to get it,it will not let you down.

I was watching films like this back then and was surprised to hear he was doing the LOTR trilogy, never would have guessed that one...

Anyway, this movie is WAY gorier then the Evil Dead stuff (which was the goriest a decade or so earlier), but it's not really disturbing. They have some gross out gags. You know, like for 10 year olds, but I still think they're funny, so there. This isn't a mean movie in the slightest, it's actually pretty fun to watch, esp with your girlfriend/spouse or friends that have a weak constitution. Again, think of a teen trying to figure a way to gross you out, and that's the basic concept, it's not really a horror film as such but it's still one of my all-time favourite movies.

If you took all the gore out (leaving maybe 20 minutes or so of film) you have a cute little love story. Seriously. It's not really the Kiwi version of Evil Dead with way more fake blood and various body fluids. It's actually got decent actors for what it is, I mean, they were never trying to win a grammy or oscar or whatever with this one, that would come later (LOTR coughcoughcough).

This is basicly just a horror comedy, and a really good one at that. It's also very cartoonish. It's nowhere near as mean spirited as a movie like (what's popular???) Saw or Hotel is. It cracks me up that people think this is the most disturbing movie ever, really, you have no clue what's out there. I guess it's disturbing the number of times I've seen this in the last 20 years, I wore out 2 copies on VHS. BTW, if you can find Braindead it's the same movie and a little longer depending on the cut.

Besides Lionel, Father Jon McGruder kicks butt, he's the Kung-Fu/Karate Priest and one of the highlights of the movie. You'll just have to see it.

They have at least 4 versions of this floating around now (different cuts from the US R Rated 85 minute version to the full 104 minutes) and according to Peter Jackson, the 97 minute version is the best one. I can't figure the R rated version out though, since they have WAY more disturbing/sick/gory movies out these days that carry an R rating. Who knows how they do these things. The R version is a little choppy in the cuts (or was on my old VHS version anyway), but the unrated one is just fine, I havn't seen the one Peter Jackson likes so not sure what all they did to it, but I'll get it sooner or later.",1340150400,,2532,4.244813278008299
192984,5,157362408X,"I've been very critical of reviews of other zombie-related films that lamented the lack of gore and overall grossness.  I now feel vindicated - because ""Dead Alive,"" like other first-rate gore-fests, just plain gets it right.  And that's the point: no matter how much gore - and this film tops them all - it can be done (dare I say it?) tastefully.  As most reviewers have already pointed out, this is primarily a comedy; the gore is just window dressing.  Incredibly, though, the gore somehow doesn't seem gratuitous; it's actually necessary to both plot and character development.  Besides, it's not really gross gore; there are no bugs crawling out of people's noses and armpits - to me that's gratuitous gore.  There was a movie (I don't even remember what it was about) called ""Buckets of Blood""; this movie could rightly be called ""Boxcars of Blood.""

Anyone familiar with the ""Theater of the Absurd"" from the late 60's-early 70's would readily identify ""Dead Alive"" as an heir to that theatrical genre.  The very idea of the movie's hero desperately seeking a way to keep four undead people tastefully hidden away from public view is about as absurd as anything the ""Theater of the Absurd"" every envisioned. Which of course makes the humor here something like Deadpan on Steroids.  The lead actor, Timothy Balme, is absolutely enchanting as the hapless soul whose mother turns zombie.  And not far behind him is Ian Watkin as his greedy, sleazy uncle.

The movie is very good. It is a typical comedy/ horror film with lots of surprises and as mentioned on the cover i think it is the MOST GORIEST FRIGHT FILM OF ALL TIME!!. Everyone that's old enough to remember will confirm with you that this is a real classic!!!. When i usually talk about horror and directors i like, there's  always someone who's like : Men!, have you seen that crazy movie with that guy in the end covered in blood and guts holding a lawn mower  and tryn to fight zombies or something....

I know damn well what movie they are talking about!!! DEAD ALIVE  by peter Jackson, or BRAINDEAD  (which was the old name for the movie.) its probably one of the goriest movies i`ve seen and trust me..i have seen a lot!! But its also very funny, the acting is good, very special.....  so as the directing...

It kinda looks like they wanted to do this ""old style"", with lot's of romance and cute dialogs, i guess some would say its a little cheesy but i think it was done on purpose, for the style kinda thing..... the cinematography used here is also reflecting this. Very good work!!!

As the movie is very special to us (horror fans), kinda of magic. I decided i would not talk about the plot and the story as i usually do with my horror movie reviews...i want it to be a surprise if you ever decide to watch it!

Its an old movie and kind of obscure so you can't expect the best transfer. With a side by side comparison of the DVD it DOES look better, just don't expect to be wowed.

193003,4,157362408X,"If you haven't seen Dead Alive, or if you a long time fan such as yours truly, blu ray is obviously the way for this to be seen right? Well, lets say that the picture and sound top the dvd and video presentations, but if you've seen them you would know that's not saying anything. The Bad Taste dvd eclipsed the Dead Alive dvd because once upon a time ago Anchor Bay really took care of and polished old movies into being all that they could be and better. Vidmark, Trimark, and now Lionsgate never seemed concerned with such things.
 But that's not what this is about, blu ray presentation. Before I received this in the mail, i read somewhere that the picture isn't great and only looks to be about twice the resolution of a dvd. Now if Dead Alive had a good picture on dvd that might be true, but IMO had one of the worst pictures I've ever seen on dvd. So any bit of upgrade beats the dvd. When I was watching blu with 120hz picture resolution, during the first half I kept thinking over and over again ""this is what the dvd should have looked like"" which means by blu standards the first half is not great, its clear and at times vivid but there is never ending freckles and pops in the picture. By the time the carnage begins it seems the picture really cleans itself up and looks great. The final 45 min of this movie look like blu ray should. Crystal clear, no flecks, great. Period. To any fans of this, the blu is must own because in the United States at least, your not gonna get a better looking version of this movie anywhere. I'm happy with it.
 Sound is in DTS-HD MA 2.0. Nothing too great but it does the job. No bonus features other than a (fullscreen standard) trailer for the film and other lionsgates films you have already seen 5 years ago.
 If you like, or love this movie, again the bluray is must own for the picture upgrade. For new fans don't waste time on terrible dvd, this is all you need.",1317945600,8,1918,4.249315068493151
193014,4,157362408X,"This is a review of the US release of Dead Alive on blu ray and has nothing to do with the movie itself.
As we fans of this brilliant classic from Peter Jackson have been waiting for a good video release, Lionsgate just upconverted the video image on this blu ray. The old Trimark looked horrible! This blu ray looks better, but not much. I wanted to be blown away with the bright colors of this supposed 1080p release. The picture quality looks like a good DVD upconverted. I didn't expect Avatar quality, but at least restore the picture. The colors are still muted, specks and dirt abound, softness that distracts from any enjoyment. This classic deserves better than what cheap Lionsgate is willing to do. At least they finally got the aspect ratio closer to what it supposed to be. But that aside, there still are no special features (a trailer) and this movie deserves at least a commentary.
And also missing is the 107 minute version of Braindead. It would have been nice to see the two and let us fans decide on which version we like the best.
Even at ten bucks, this blu ray is a disappointment, but I still prefer it over all other US home video releases. Too bad it doesn't get the respect it deserves.
Maybe next time, Peter Jackson would supervise a director's cut of his classic.
Until then, this will have to do.

193015,5,157362408X,"What more can be said about Peter Jackson's classic 1992 release Dead Alive (a.k.a. Brain Dead internationally)? It is still my personal favorite film of his ever growing filmography and is still just as hilariously gross and depraved today as when it was first released. People who only know of Peter Jackson from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and his re-make of King Kong are usually shocked when they are exposed to his initial 3 films Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles and Dead Alive. If you haven't experienced Dead Alive yet, what are you waiting for?!

Regarding the blu-ray of Dead Alive that was released by Lionsgate on 10/4/11, I would first like to mention that despite a lot of grumbling around the internet that the picture quality on the blu-ray is supposedly terrible, that is actually not the case at all. I have owned the old anamorphic Trimark DVD of the unrated version for years and did direct comparisons to the blu-ray.

The blu-ray is a big step up in overall picture quality from the old Trimark DVD. In fact, the blu-ray shows how blurry in a lot of places the DVD was. Color, textures and especially flesh tones are much improved on the blu-ray release and I find it to easily be the best that the film has ever looked to date. Don't listen to reviews that state that the blu-ray looks worse than the DVD. They either don't actually have the old Trimark DVD for direct comparison or are expecting a low budget horror film from the early 90's to look like The Dark Knight or something on the blu-ray. Could Lionsgate possibly have restored the movie further than was done for this blu-ray release? Perhaps, but since the blu-ray represents such a leap in picture quality over the DVD, I'm very happy as a hardcore Dead Alive fan.

One other thing that is important to mention is that the framing of the film is much closer to the original 1.66:1 intented aspect ratio that Peter Jackson shot and intented the film to be shown at. The Trimark DVD was overmatted, specifically at the bottom of the frame. The scene near the third act for instance when the poison bottle rolls over to show the words ""animal stimulant"" on the back of the bottle completely cut off the S at the bottom of the frame. The top of the picture was also a little overmatted too. Lionsgate has opened up the matting to where most of the S is visible and there is a little more picture information at the top of the frame too so the blu-ray doesn't feel as cramped as the DVD did. If your TV has a ""screen fit"" mode that you can watch in instead of the usual slightly cropped ""16:9"" mode like my HDTV does, I recommend watching it in screen fit mode as it still fills up your HDTV. This way no picture information is cut off at all when watching the blu-ray.

The other thing that people are complaining about is that the blu-ray like the unrated DVD features the 97 minute cut of the movie instead of the 104 minute international cut. Peter Jackson has multiple times stated that the 97 minute version is his preferred cut of the film and is what he considers his director's cut. There was a delay in the North American release of Dead Alive as there was another horror film out at the time that had the rights to its original title of Brain Dead. While Trimark was working out the legal problems of trying to work out a deal with the title, Peter Jackson decided to revisit his initial 104 minute New Zealand cut and tighten it up further. Mostly what was removed were some character moments that slowed down the pacing of the film. Yes, a little gore mainly during the infamous lawn mower sequence was removed but all of the cuts that he did were purely for pacing reasons. I have seen both verions and prefer the tighter pacing of the 97 minute cut.

Would it have been nice to have a choice of what version to watch on the blu-ray? Yes, it would have been. Also, the blu-ray is bare bones with the exception of the theatrical trailer. I would have loved to seen at least a Peter Jackson commentary track or some kind of featurettes on the film's legacy and importance in Peter's career at that point & time. But, most places are selling this for only 10 bucks and if you love Dead Alive as much as I do, it is well worth shelling out a bit more money to get the film in the much superior picture quality on the blu-ray.

So as I stated earlier in this review, don't pay attention to reviews stating that the blu-ray looks horrible. It is a huge improvement over the Trimark DVD released over a decade ago and worth every penny in my opinion!",1317859200,12,4537,4.41457586618877

About the film, Peter Jackson created the goriest, funniest film this side of Evil Dead 2, and the violence and gore is so over the top, a viewer soon becomes immune to it, and it become hilarious. Plus Jackson's often zany use of the undead is used in ways nothing short of a Tex Avery cartoon. Lionsgate is butchering a great, iconic film in the career of a great director.

After Lionel agrees to let Les have the money and the house, we see the music for the party get turned on and Void breaking free from his bonds. In Braindead a party guest lets Void out of the basement, and for his trouble gets headbutted.

During the party Void enters the living room and attacks a guest. Lionel intervenes by hitting Void around the head with a Jack Daniels bottle and then pours the contents down Voids throat.

After the Zombies have been let out of the basement, there is a short sequence where a guest with glasses is chased around a room by 2 zombies before he is finally caught and bitten. (In Dead Alive you can see the very end of this sequence just before the camera switches to Paquita stabbing a bag of tomatoes in the airing cupboard.)

After Lionel has bitten through the intestine and falls onto a zomies head, in Dead Alive we move onto Les killing zombie by ""rolling"" it to death in a clothes press. In Braindead Lionel is confronted by the vicar & nurse zombies who impail each other on a pitch fork and continue to have sex.

In Braindead there is approximately 16 seconds of extra gore in the lawnmower sequence where we see Lionel hack up numerous zombies, see the demise of the vicar and the nurse (whilst still in the middle of making love) and see Lional kicking body parts towards Paquita to be put into the food mixer.

  Just before Lionel makes his entrance with the lawnmower, Paquita and friend (the one with glasses) are attacked by Voids legs (cut off in the bathroom scene) and a horde of zombies. Paquita and the girl grab a leg each and rip them apart. They then use these limbs to attack any zombie that comes near them.",1312502400,24,2767,4.468253968253968

Pace wise, it's very slow.
So, in a lot of ways, it's like 'Slow Camp'.

Not that you can't have fun at Slow Camp, I know I enjoyed all those summers making crafts with little rounded scissors!
In fact, an ashtray I once made looked a lot like the claymation creature early on in the film (that's not a good thing).

The FX in Dead Alive was not where the budget went, though Bill Cosby was heard to say ""Wow, that's a lot of pudding! Meh-heh, mumble mumble wit da pudding."" The budget went to the cinematography and the acting - which (from the classic characters you'd expect to the reluctant-Hero and spunky-Heroin) was really well done all around.

I liked this film.

But then again, I like to discover the ""treasures"" in my navel at the end of a long day.

193042,5,157362408X,"Currently Peter Jackson is reknowned for his epic fantasy movies (if you haven't noticed), solid book adaptations and exceptional cult remakes. But once upon a time, he was better known for splatter-gore horror movies, like the ""Dead Alive,"" a bizarrely hilarious movie full of zombies, rat-monkeys and messy death. Glorious!

Lionel (Timothy Balme) is a downtrodden young man, who has the unpleasant honor of caring for his nasty mum (Elizabeth Moody). Then he meets store clerk Paquita (Diana Pealver), and the two young people fall in love. Unfortunately, during a date to the zoo, his mom follows them so she can wreck his date.

She succeeds, sort of -- she gets bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey from Skull Island (the same one where Kong came from?) and dies. But poor Lionel can't get off that easily -- because of the bite, his mom comes back to life as a flesh-eating zombie. Soon zombies are running amok, and Lionel and Paquita must find a way to get rid of them. Can true love triumph over the undead?

Be forewarned: this movie is gross. Very disgusting. Lots of fluids and body parts, and zombies eating people in detail. And the whole movie climaxes with hundreds of zombies crashing a party, and a spectacularly gory sequence involving a, uh, lawnmower and chainsaw.

But gore alone doesn't make a movie a cult hit -- any idiot can make a zombie movie. This one is special because of Jackson's twisted sense of humor; ""Shaun of the Dead"" definitely owes a stylistic debt to him. How many movies do you see where a character tries to clean up the blood after Zombie Mom has lunch?

Jackson sprinkles his 1950s setting with all sorts of weird characters -- a kung-fu reverend and a Nazi vet among them. He takes every weird zombie scenario and runs with it, whether it's Lionel babysitting a hyper zombie baby or the Reverend McGruder announcing, ""I kick ass for the Lord!"" or ""Stand back boy! This calls for some divine intervention!""

But the movie is also notable for a very touching love story, between Lionel and Paquita -- and like any good hero, Lionel has to overcome obstacles (the zombies and Mum) before they can live happily ever after. Both actors do very solid jobs, and Balme really makes us like his downtrodden mama's boy, especially once Lionel picks up that lawnmower.

""Dead Alive"" is a delightfully stomach-turning ride through a town full of zombies, body parts, and those ugly little buggers from Skull Island. Although it's not for the faint of stomach.",1307836800,,2490,4.763341067285383
193043,5,157362408X,"Ok, now this movie can be viewed two ways. One, as a critic with a notebook who would probably scribble down ""Absolute piece of crap do not even waste your time"" or with your mates with a pizza, plenty of beer and you would probably view it as ""Bloody fantastic"". I tried to do both but quickly got bored with the first way and almost immediately did the second and me and my friends' reactions were exactly like what I typed earlier, ""Bloody fantastic"".
Sure it's bloody, sure it's gory sure and it's not the greatest movie of all time but when you sit down and watch would you really expect Citizen Kane? The caption above the title basically says what the whole 100 minutes of pure gory entertainment is all about. It's a gory tale of a wimpy but overall nice bloke called Lionel living and obeying under his over-bearing mother's every rule. But after mummy is bitten by a  sumatran rat monkey everything gets a little bit more stressful for Lionel as his mother has turned into a zombie. As he now has to hide her mother's victims, including a dog, from the rest of the neighbourhood. But through all the hilarious, bloody and sometimes disgusting moments it all climaxes with the infamous lawnmower scene and when Lionel is finally ""born again"" but I won't spoil it for first timers.
Overall it's not a great movie by any means, nor it is a terrible movie but it is great entertainment and briiliant comedy laced with Python-esque style humour perfectly showcases Peter Jackson's warped sense of humour which is also shown in Meet the Feebles and Bad Taste and an obvious skilled director who would move onto bigger and better things such as Lord of the Rings and King Kong.

193071,5,157362408X,"The recent release of ZOMBIELAND has fans of the unique subgenre known as the ""zomedy"" falling all over themselves either to praise that  flick or to condemn it. In either case they usually for better or worse compare it to SHAUN OF THE DEAD, the popular British flick starring Simon Pegg, and I can see that, really I can. But the comparisons have been so consistent and so exclusive of almost all other zomedies that I feel it incumbent upon myself to say, doesn't ANYBODY remember Peter Jackson's 1992 flick DEAD-ALIVE? Am I really the only person on the face of the earth (or Lunch at least) who looks back fondly on that 97 minutes of mildly loopy humor that culminates in what I am almost certain is still the most outrageously gory deneouement ever to grace any zombie flick comedy or otherwise?

The film opens on Skull island (located south of Sumatra) where an explorer has suceeded in capturing a rare Sumatran Rat Monkey and is headed for a jeep that will help take him and his rare prize back to New Zealand and the Wellington Zoo. Local natives try to stop him, warning him that the animal is not only dangerous but also sacred to them and that there is no way that monkey is leaving their island. Well, long story short, monkey leaves explorer doesn't. In the ensuing chase the guy is bitten and scratched by the beastie. His local guides cut off his arms and then his head. Roll opening credits. (You get a double dismemberment AND a decapitation before the credits? Well, the decapitation is implied.) The guides grab the caged animal and take off.  Eventually it's  shoved on a plane for new Zealand where we meet out hapless hero Lionel (Timothy Balme) when he drops into a grocery store to leave off the weekly order. His timing is impecable because our heroine Pacquita (Diana Penalier) has just had her future told by her grandmother, to wit: she will very soon meet the one man she will love for the rest of her life and there will be a sign. Lionel knocks over some pens. Presto, there's the sign.

Love ain't going to be easy for Lionel and Pacquita though because he's got the Queen of all bitchy, domineering mothers, and he's a spinless dweeb in the bargain. Nonetheless Pacquita tricks him into asking her out on a date to the zoo. Zoo? Uh oh. Double uh oh because Mum overhears and follows to spy on them. Here's where we get our first look at the Sumatran Rat Monkey which is rendered via good old fashioned stop motion animation. He's adorably nasty and he promptly takes a chunk out of Mum when she gets too close to his cage but he obviously didn't know who he was dealing with because she smushes him into sumatran jelly. Date over. Lionel has to take Mum home and tend to her injuries.

From here things go down hill pretty rapidly although not quite as rapidly as you might expect and definitely not as fast as most fans would hope, as I said Lionel's a bit of a milquetoast. After Mum becomes an official member of the undead, Lionel just can't bring himself to dispatch her (or the nurse practioner she chowed down on) so he decideds to keep them both in the cellar and hope no one will noice they're not around. He sedates them with tranquillizers procured from a local veterinarian who's personal history is hilariously suspect (look for the swastica under his lab coat) and tries to keep his horrible secret. Mum escapes though and gets hit by a streetcar making a funeral necessary, but Lionel's frantic about how to keep her quiet while she's supposedly ""dead"".  It doesn't go smoothly, but Mum does get planted.  She doesn't stay down long though causing Lionel's undead problems to increase, leading to more sedated undead bodies in the cellar, and an uncle who tries to blackmail him thinking he's a murderer, and then there's that Big Finale I alluded to earlier.

DEAD-ALIVE (called BRAINDEAD in New Zealand) can be found in many versions. Before I go further I must warn against the R-rated 90 American minute version. It has been heavily edited, contains little of the real gore, and makes very little sense as a result of the editing. The unrated 97 minute American version is more watchable but I'm told still suffers greatly when compared to the original 107 minute version that the rest of the world enjoys under it's original title. There are also versions out at 100 and 103 minutes. Peter Jackson himself has been quoted as saying that he prefers the 97 minute version because it gave him more time to polish the film.

Jackson had a 3 million dollar budget here and it was his biggest to that date. Most of it was spent on special effects of course and if there is a single moment here of CGI I certainly can't spot it. Everything seems to be done old school using puppetry, make up, prosthetics, and stop motion animation and fans of old school effects should be euphoric. I know I was. There are undead deaths by all sorts of amusing means--one zombie has her head smashed into a light bulb and for the next 5 minutes or so she just hangs there impaled on the wall with light shooting out of her entire body like some kind of grotesque nightlight. The zombies themselves may take a licking but they keep on ticking! These guys are really hard to discourage; cut 'em off at the waist and both halves keep coming after you., cut off their arms and body and arms alike have one goal in mind (?), eviscerate them and it's RE-ANIMATOR time! I defy any gore hound to see this flick and not come away totally satisfied by the sheer amount of carnage Jackson inflicts upon his audience. And we're not even talking about the imaginative, creative, and downright silly methods that are employed. I love it when film makers show me something I haven't see before or carry it to an extreme that I would never have thought possible and Jackson won my heart with this flick. Whether or not the more subtle humor stacks up to SHAUN or not is a matter of personal preference I suppose, but for me it's close to a tie. Some of the characters in Kiwi flix can be priceless and a lot of the humor is character drawn. Yes Father McGruder I'm talking about you. I loved him in the graveyard but afterward he gets all hinky and kinky. Believe me folks, this movie will NEVER show on TV.

If you call yourself a horror fan and have not seen this flick then you are depriving yourself of a unique experience--this is a must see. Oh a few last things. Watch for the late Forry Ackerman as a camera toting tourist snapping a photo of Mum getting bitten by the rat monkey at the zoo. And the next time you watch Jackson's KING KONG look for the cage labled SUMATRAN RAT MONKEY in the hold of the ship. You see it the first time Adrian Brody goes down there.

193084,5,157362408X,"Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Braindead(or Dead-Alive in US) are Peter Jackson's splatstick comedies that gave him a cult status before Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson directed movies with comedy and extreme gore at first then later fantasy including Lord of the Rings. Peter is known for both his gory past and award-winning present times. People who only know Peter for Lord of the Rings and King Kong would be shocked seeing his earlier splat films.

Braindead(UK) is Dead-Alive in the US due to conflicts with another film called Braindead(US). Some segments were also removed, even unrated Dead-Alive is not fully uncut.

Dead-Alive is about a guy caring for his cruel mother that he still loves. At a zoo, the mother gets bitten by a cursed monkey while trying to scold her caring son for dating a woman because the guy's mother is misogynistic. The guy's mother deteriates over time and dies. The mother zombifies and starts the zombie chain reaction.

Dead-Alive is full of unforgettable gore, characters, laughs, and quotes.
The gore is excessive in a comical fashion. Dead-Alive is known as the goriest movie by bloodcount by the gallon. The gore left me laughing in a exhausted manner. The characters are like if they came from a comic book. The main character is similar to Bruce Campbell's Ash character and there's also martial artist priest. Dead-Alive does have it's funny moments like a evil zombie baby that laughs deviously. The quotes are comic book like. The priest sees zombies creating havoc and says ""I kick arse for the Lord!"" The priest then beats up the zombies.

Peter's Dead-Alive is certainly a cool movie. The acting is cheesy but it's for comic reasons. The scenery looks like the scenery from Peter's later horror comedy The Frighteners. The story is very creative and even has a twist. The cheesiness of Dead-Alive doesn't interfere, it's all for the fun. It's for people who are into horror and comics. I like Peter old and new, he is a genius.

I ordered a copy from Amazon.com and it's unrated from Lion's Gate Entertainment. The special features barely exist but still a great buy.",1246060800,,2123,4.8535911602209945
193085,5,157362408X,"""Dead Alive"" is one of the most well-known comedy-horror crossover movies and was directed by Peter Jackson, the same guy that directed the ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy. Wow. WOW! Hard to believe a director can go from grinding up zombies with a lawnmower to six-foot elves trampling along the massive valleys near Amon Amarth (the mountain in LOTR, not the band, although the band is awesome, too!)

But indeed, Peter Jackson DID direct this movie. Although it's not really horror by any means, considering all the one-liners, the slapstick humor and the gross-out gags, it's really a comedy. However, it's a comedy that probably only horror lovers would watch! The first hour or essentially plays off as a comedy without all that much gore. There are some funny moments, such as the wealthy people eating their pudding as their ears and such fall off into it! (""Rich and creamy! Just how I like it!""). We ALSO get a crazy monkey and Lionel beating the death out of a zombie baby in the middle of a park!

So the first hour or so is entertaining enough, BUT make sure you have the patience to make it to the last 30 minutes, because it WILL be worth the wait! I mean, I've seen gore before, but by the time I saw the last half-hour of ""Dead Alive"", including the famous lawnmower massacre scene and a room full of zombies later ending up a room full of zombie blood...this movie is definitely one of the goriest movies in history. And it's funny at the same time! Peter Jackson is able to make scenes that you THINK would be gross, actually very amusing!

While this movie isn't THE UTMOST goriest movie ever made, that award possibly going to Japanese action film ""The Machine Girl"", this movie is at the very least one of the Top 5 Goriest Movies Ever Made. If you ever wondered what slapstick humor, one-liners, 10,000 Extra Large KFC Buckets full of fake blood and a sweet romance between two young people would result in...check out ""Dead Alive"" for some entertainment!

193102,5,157362408X,"Currently Peter Jackson is reknowned for his fantasy movies and exceptional cult remakes. But once upon a time, he was better known for splatter-gore horror movies, like the ""Dead Alive,"" a bizarrely hilarious movie full of zombies, rat-monkeys and messy death. Glorious!

Lionel (Timothy Balme) is a downtrodden young man, who has the unpleasant honor of caring for his nasty mum (Elizabeth Moody). Then he meets store clerk Paquita (Diana Pe&ntilde;alver), and the two young people fall in love. Unfortunately, during a date to the zoo, his mom follows them so she can wreck his date.

She succeeds, sort of -- she gets bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey from Skull Island (the same one where Kong came from?) and dies. But poor Lionel can't get off that easily -- because of the bite, his mom comes back to life as a flesh-eating zombie. Soon zombies are running amok, and Lionel and Paquita must find a way to get rid of them. Can true love triumph over the undead?

Be forewarned: this movie is gross. Very disgusting. Lots of fluids and body parts, and zombies eating people in detail. And the whole movie climaxes with hundreds of zombies crashing a party, and a spectacularly gory sequence involving a, uh, lawnmower and chainsaw.

But gore alone doesn't make a movie a cult hit -- any idiot can make a zombie movie. This one is special because of Jackson's twisted sense of humor; ""Shaun of the Dead"" definitely owes a stylistic debt to him. How many movies do you see where a character tries to clean up the blood after Zombie Mom has lunch?

Jackson sprinkles his 1950s setting with all sorts of weird characters -- a kung-fu reverend and a Nazi vet among them. He takes every weird zombie scenario and runs with it, whether it's Lionel babysitting a hyper zombie baby or the Reverend McGruder announcing, ""I kick ass for the Lord!"" or ""Stand back boy! This calls for some divine intervention!""

But the movie is also notable for a very touching love story, between Lionel and Paquita -- and like any good hero, Lionel has to overcome obstacles (the zombies and Mum) before they can live happily ever after. Both actors do very solid jobs, and Balme really makes us like his downtrodden mama's boy, especially once Lionel picks up that lawnmower.

""Dead Alive"" is a delightfully stomach-turning ride through a town full of zombies, body parts, and those ugly little buggers from Skull Island. Although it's not for the faint of stomach.",1229904000,2,2444,4.763593380614657

If I would of seen this when it was made I would of loved it no doubt but over the last few years my taste has changed in movies. The gore is over the top but it really doesn't bother me that much anymore considering I was eating while I watched it. I would say at least every three minutes there is some sort of gore scene involved in this about a hour and a half flick and close to the end about every half a second. I only rented this and probably would never buy it since its not worth more than ninety nine cents but odds are if you love horror and over the top gore you are gonna love this but it just wasn't for me.

193133,5,157362408X,"The Film: Dead Alive
Year Made: 1993

Overview: A man keeps watch over his dominating mother who wants her son's complete attention. When Lionel (her son) meets his love of his life, mother is not happy for him.  Things great really ugly after mother is bit by the Sumatran Rat Monkey! Mother begins to get ill and lose more than just her temper, dinner will never be the same again!

The Package: 2 Stars.  The cover is ok, but I thought it should have been a bit more gory much like the film itself.  The inside has no inlay at all, the disc itself is very easy to pop out and holds itself in the holder which is great.  The disc is pretty plain though with only a white look to it, no zombies or anything spooky or gory on the disc graphics.  Included is the trailer for the film which is great, not much else to say for the package though, thought it could be better.

Spook Meter: 2 Stars. Dead alive is not very spooky at all.  There are a few parts that will make you jump a little, but overall it's not super spooky.  Ok, now it's time to highlight why this film is still a 5 star film.  Gory, funny, violent, cheesy acting that is beyond words is what makes this extremely unique and oh so fun to watch.  Dead alive will not keep you awake for the night in fear, it's not that kind of film.  It will however give you a huge smile and think to yourself at the end of it `this was one of the best moments in horror for a film of its kind that I just seen' I loved the pace of how everything built up.  I won't give much away; I never like to do that in my reviews. It starts out kind of tame and builds to a knock your socks off horror event that must be seen to be believed. Another extreme strong point is the sounds of the zombies. In some films the demons or zombies just don't sound that great.  Here we get some really excellent sounds.  When one zombie's head gets chopped nearly off, the gargle ling sounds that it makes is so gory and gross  and so funny at the same time it's worth it just to hear that sound!  The other standout and one of my favorite things of the whole film is the zombie baby!  I won't give out details of it, just watch for a baby zombie and I thought that is so cool I can't even put it into words!  Oh and the lawn mower scene, ok, enough, you have to see this film for yourself, it's indescribable and something that you needs to be seen for yourself.

Gore/Violence Meter: 5 Stars.  This is where Dead Alive truly makes it's own special mark in horror history.  The gore IS truly the most bloody horror film that I have personally ever had the chance to see as of this writing.  In fact, I really don't think there is or will be another that could top this as far as gore.  Before I bought this, I read other reviews and admit I thought, nah these reviews are probably not really true and it won't be all that gory.  I didn't want to get my hopes up and be let down after all. I admit, it really was that gory, my guess is a good part of the films budget just went for fake blood alone! As for the violence, it's extremely violent.  Before someone reads this and thinks, no way will they watch Dead Alive because of the gore/violence, I must point out that it's not the same type of extreme violence that can be found in films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.  This is not a torture real feeling type violence that makes you cringe as you watch it.  It does have a different feel to it, with that said though; no doubt it's 5 stars on the gore/violence meter and then some.  If spewing ooooze offends you or makes you sick, DO NOT watch Dead Alive.

Profanity Meter:  3 Strikes.  There is a fair amount of bad language throughout Dead Alive, it is closed captioned though so you can filter out the bad language if you have a DVD language filter like I do.

Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes.  The sexual meter was a bit more difficult to determine for this particular film, but I'll describe here what you can expect as a potential viewer so you can decide for yourself if you wish to view this.  Ok, there is nearly nothing sexual as far as normal people are concerned in Dead Alive.  There are a few kissing scenes and that is it.  What is shown are a couple of zombies and ones wants to get a bit ""fresh"" with the other one. Nothing is really shown however lots of sounds can be herd as two people stand outside of a door and can hear zombies having sex.  One other scene is of the another female zombie and her breasts are shown, however what you see is, well, rotted zombie decaying flesh for breasts so it's not exactly anything to be offended by as a viewer.  That is it on the sexual meter; I'll let you decide as a viewer what you feel.

Final Thoughts:  Dead Alive is truly a one of a kind film.  It gets a few ideas from something like The Evil Dead, yet it has it's own charm that makes it unique and fresh enough that make it a well deserved 5 star film by itself.  If you LOVE GORE, (my hand goes way up, I LOVE gore) you will watch this in absolute sheer delight and have a grin from ear to ear all the way through just as I did.  No other film is as gory as this, it's a must have to your horror collection.",1211414400,,5173,4.107569721115538
193134,5,157362408X,"This movie is not for the weak-stomached or faint-hearted.  BUT, although chock-full-of-gore, it is not to be taken seriously, therefore making it a little less gross??
Poor Lionel lives with his domineering posessive mother who, after being bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey (which she quickly crushes with her shoe!) begins to fall apart- literally.
As her condition worsens, including her ear falling off into a bowl of custard (which she eats, and spits out an earring) she finally dies, and goes beyond the door of death into zombieville.
Lionel tries his best to keep it all hush-hush as he attempts to woo the lady in his life, but as we all know, zombies multiply (and in this movie, actually procreate!) and soon the situation is out of control, leading to a climax that you will never forget, nor will you ever feel the same way about your lawnmower!!

193173,4,157362408X,"LORD OF THE RINGS. KING KONG. DEAD ALIVE? New Zealand director Peter Jackson, now filthy rich and up to his arse in Oscars, had his roots in bizarre humor and gore, topped with his third film DEAD ALIVE (or BRAINDEAD as it is called everywhere else but the U.S.A. for some reason). DEAD ALIVE is widely regarded as the goriest film ever made. It wins that award proudly, though I'm sure there's something out there that tops this (but hopefully not).
The story is a simple one: Norman Bates-clone Lionel Cosgrove lives with his devil of a mother Vera, who treats him like he is her slave. Then Lionel falls in love with sweet Paquita, and before you know it, Vera is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey at the zoo where Lionel & Paquita are having a date. This causes a series of events in which Vera and other townsfolk end up in the cellar of Lionel's home, dead and angry. The whole movie climaxes with Lionel's scheming Uncle Les having a party in which all members are creatively and horribly killed by Vera and the other zombies. However, zombies aren't the only thing on Jackson's menu: destined love, family troubles, and a general disregard for the safety of animals and children are thrown in as well.
DEAD ALIVE doesn't know when to stop, and that is why it works. If it held back once it started, it would be even harder to take because it might start to seem realistic.

193211,4,157362408X,"Directed by Peter Jackson (and penned by the same guy who did the screenplay for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Two-Towers/dp/B00009TB5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Two Towers</a>), ""Dead Alive"" (sometimes known as ""Braindead"") is a dark, depraved, disgusting horror-comedy in every sense of the word.  And I'll be damned if it isn't also great.

Jackson (and screenwriter Sinclair) take the age-old zombie concept and go full tilt with it.  If the LOTR movies succeeded because Jackson threw every creative cell into his body into them, because he didn't stop at ""alright"" or ""good enough,"" then ""Dead Alive"" is evidence of where his exuberance got him in the early years.  In fact, of all the adjectives that come to mind when watching this film (nauseating, campy, delirious, over-the-top, disturbing, hilarious, goofy, inventive, unreal), the best one I can think of is ""exuberant.""

Lionel Cosgrove -- a watery-eyed, whisper-thin, cluelessly-clumsy lad -- meets Paquita Maria Sanchez -- an Hispanic spit-fire with eyes as intense as glowing railroad spikes.  Paquita, believing Lionel to be her one, true love, convinces him to take her on a date.  This upsets Lionel's mother -- an overbearing and selfish emotional terrorist -- who follows them to the zoo where she is accidentally bitten by a newly acquired Sumatran rat-monkey -- a wiry, evil-eyed thing that looks like Jim-Henson-Meets-David-Lynch-In-Hell.  The mother eventually dies from the bite, but she doesn't stay dead for long.  In fact, you could say she's ... dead alive.

Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Right.  Sorry.

Lionel is much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/B00000IQVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>'s Norman Bates -- a momma's boy.  But Bates spent most of his time and mind keeping his mom alive; poor Lionel spends most of his time and mind keeping his mom dead.  She, of course, gets out every once in a while, and the evil spreads.  The rest of the movie slowly fills with mutant zombie babies, priests from a Tae Kwon Diocese, and so many outlandish and bizarre zombie mutilations/deaths that it makes the head reel.  At one point in the film, Lionel is being chased by zombies through his house, but he can't get away because he is runnning in place, his feet slipping through the rivers of blood that fill his home.  Lucky for him he has access to a lawnmower ... and blenders, crowbars, rakes, forks, knives, bats, and a huge vat of animal poison.

Jackson's ability to set up a scene is apparant even at this stage in his career, and he makes the most out of this eye-rolling and sickening premise.  It helps that he has a set of New Zealand performers that treat over-acting like a fine art form, and who embrace the subject matter with the devilish glee of a Shakespearan troupe that's been told to perform King Lear in the nude.  The movie escalates nicely, building on its own bizarre foundations, and just when you think it can't possibly get any crazier, any more violent, any more atrocious and offensive ... well, it does.

Don't expect brilliance.  Don't expect distinction.  Don't expect something you can show to the squeamish or easily offended.  Do expect gore.  Do expect death and comedy.  Do expect a farce of mutilation and romance.  It may not be subtle or have any filmic nuances, but ""Dead Alive"" does deliver exactly what it promises: humor that can most accurately be described as ""gut-busting.""",1176249600,4,3521,5.2504472271914135

193240,5,157362408X,"Director Peter Jackson, virtually unknown at the time, completed this cult classic and thus set the bar for the horror comedy genre.  Not since has Dead Alive's cleverness, intelligence and outright over the top zombie violence and gore been matched.  Only Shaun of the Dead would be a worthy contender.  But it's better to think of Shaun of the Dead as Dead Alive's comedic companion. 28 Days Later may perhaps be the more frightening contender, though it's not a film about the undead. Shaun definitely owes alot to Dead Alive.  Dead Alive owes a great deal to the Evil Dead and the cult classic Return of the Living Dead.  Peter Jackson realizes this and therefore Dead Alive is jammed with references to these films as well as several other, from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Psycho.  The tongue in cheek reflexivity combined with an intelligent script, genuinely comedic characters, and some incredibly outragious set pieces, make for one hell of a great movie.  You shouldn't be too frightened by the line, the goriest movie of all time.  Indeed there is a surplus of gore in this movie.  It gleefully exploits it's gory premise and completely goes over the top with it.  In the end, the gore is more laughable than it is nauseating.  But yeah, gore is used in ways you never thought possible, and for some reason, it's strangely charming that way.

It should be mentioned that the acting here, while working in a B-Movie context, is really quite fantastic.  Timothy Balme plays Lionel.  Soon after meeting him and his mother the connection between him and Norman Bates becomes immediately clear.  Elizabeth Moody does a truly amazing job playing Lionel's domineering control freak mother who's bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey and slowing and agonizingly turns into a zombie.  Lionel feels he must try to care for his rotting yet conscious and quite flesh hungry mother.

That's the difference between a typical slasher movie and a masterpiece like this.

It even has a romance--not merely tossed into the mix, but an integral part of the story.  And Jackson creates truly engaging characters, not merely cardboard-cutout victims.  No other director combines horror, gore, humor, and campiness the way Jackson does.

193259,5,157362408X,"Currently Peter Jackson is reknowned for his fantasy movies and exceptional cult remakes. But once upon a time, he was better known for splatter-gore horror movies, like the ""Dead Alive,"" a bizarrely hilarious movie full of zombies, rat-monkeys and messy death. Glorious!

Lionel (Timothy Balme) is a downtrodden young man, who has the unpleasant honor of caring for his nasty mum (Elizabeth Moody). Then he meets store clerk Paquita (Diana Pe&ntilde;alver), and the two young people fall in love. Unfortunately, during a date to the zoo, his mom follows them so she can wreck his date.

She succeeds, sort of -- she gets bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey from Skull Island (the same one where Kong came from?) and dies. But poor Lionel can't get off that easily -- because of the bite, his mom comes back to life as a flesh-eating zombie. Soon zombies are running amok, and Lionel and Paquita must find a way to get rid of them. Can true love triumph over the undead?

Be forewarned: this movie is gross. Very disgusting. Lots of fluids and body parts, and zombies eating people in detail. And the whole movie climaxes with hundreds of zombies crashing a party, and a spectacularly gory sequence involving a, uh, lawnmower and chainsaw.

But gore alone doesn't make a movie a cult hit -- any idiot can make a zombie movie. This one is special because of Jackson's twisted sense of humor; ""Shaun of the Dead"" definitely owes a stylistic debt to him. How many movies do you see where a character tries to clean up the blood after Zombie Mom has lunch?

Jackson sprinkles his 1950s setting with all sorts of weird characters -- a kung-fu reverend and a Nazi vet among them. He takes every weird zombie scenario and runs with it, whether it's Lionel babysitting a hyper zombie baby or the Reverend McGruder announcing, ""I kick ass for the Lord!"" or ""Stand back boy! This calls for some divine intervention!""

But the movie is also notable for a very touching love story, between Lionel and Paquita -- and like any good hero, Lionel has to overcome obstacles (the zombies and Mum) before they can live happily ever after. Both actors do very solid jobs, and Balme really makes us like his downtrodden mama's boy, especially once Lionel picks up that lawnmower.

""Dead Alive"" is a delightfully stomach-turning ride through a town full of zombies, body parts, and those ugly little buggers from Skull Island. Although it's not for the faint of stomach.",1152057600,9,2444,4.763593380614657

No fan of horror that is not grossed out by excessive gore and humorous deaths should pass this up.

""Dead Alive"" is a very clever horror/comedy that's a must-have for any Peter Jackson fan.  Don't expect it to be scary.  It's not, just riotously disgusting.  In fact, ""Dead Alive"" is probably better described as a gross-out comedy than a horror film, having far more in common with ""There's Something About Mary"" than ""Hellraiser.""

Unfortunately, this DVD is very disappointing.  It's basically just an ordinary-quality VHS edition burned onto a DVD. The image is grainy and the sound quality poor; the film is only presented in full-screen format, and there are no worthwhile special features. No director's commentary, no ""making-of"" featurettes, no nuthin'.

Peter Jackson is famous enough now that a ""Special Edition"" DVD of this film, one of his earliest, has got to be coming out soon enough. You'd be wise to save your money until then.",1137024000,3,998,5.048780487804878
193269,5,157362408X,"Officially the goriest movie of all time, Peter ""Lord of the Rings"" Jackson's brilliant  Brain Dead (weakly re-titled ""Dead Alive"" in the USA) provides the most OTT and blackly humorous  splatterfest imaginable. It is bound to appeal to those who enjoyed the likes of The Evil Dead, Society, House/House2, American Werewolf in London and, more recently, Shaun of the Dead.

Apart from the obvious influence of the Romero trilogy, Brain Dead also contains many cheeky hat-tips to other movies and playing spot-the-reference  (I'll start you off with King Kong, The Thing, Child's Play, Wizard of Oz , Carrie, Indiana Jones, Dracula, Psycho and semi-reprising a scene from Jackson's earlier Bad Taste) adds immensely to the fun!

Most of the characters are cleverly observed clichs - from the passionate latina Paquita herself, her Tarot-reading gypsy grandmother, the leather-clad rockers, the rugby-playing bore and snobbish townswomen, to Lionel's hideously domineering mother and lecherously repellent uncle.

Some great one-liners, such as  ""Your mother ate my DOG!"" and  ""I kick arse for the LORD!"" provide genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but it is the sheer outrageousness of the visual gags (glueing mother's face back with gloy paste and the animated intestines are my favourites!)  each more gross than the last, that makes Brain Dead such a masterpiece of  the schlock-horror splatterfest genre.

The DVD presentation (UK region 2 version) is pretty basic. The picture quality is no better than adequate, looking like a straight port over from VHS and becomes glitchy and pixellated briefly in a couple of scenes. Audio is just plain mono.  No extras either. This movie is just screaming out to be re-mastered in 5.1 and with a ""making-of"" documentary (let's face it, Jackson and team must have had a hoot making this one!), but, for now, this is the best you gore-fans are going to get.

193271,5,157362408X,"I guess everybody knows this masterpiece of gore and guts by early Peter Jackson (which, by the way, appears here in a cameo as an undertaker's assistant). And it already occupied its niche in every hardcore horror fan's heart. What I have to say relates to the edition itself. If you have an opportunity to choose, pick British ""Braindead"" edition instead of American ""Dead Alive"" one. It's available on amazon.co.uk. Because ""Dead Alive"" edition is cut, while the British is not. The essential differences are the following:

1. In ""Dead Alive"" after Lionel agrees to let Les have the money and the house, a dead guy is breaking free from the cellar. In ""Braindead"" one of the guests lets him out and gets a punch in the head.

2. In ""Dead Alive"" there's a scene missing where Lionel is hitting that same zombie with a bottle of whisky and then pouring its content into guy's throat.

3. In ""Braindead"" the scene is present of a guest being chased by two zombies.

4. In ""Dead Alive"" the scene is missing of a priest and a nurse impaling each other on a pitch fork, after that they continue to have sex forming kind of a power-tool.

5. In ""Braindead"" there're approximately 16 seconds of extra gore in lawnmower-carnage scene.

6. ""Dead Alive"" is also missing a scene where Paquita and her friend are attacked by legs of a guy torn apart. They grab a leg each, rip them apart in turn and start using them as weapons against incoming zombies.

There are many editions of ""Braindead"" on the market but most of them don't have any bonus features. Editions that have some, have minor extras as different trailers and filmographies, but no documentaries or commentaries. So as we wait for Peter Jackson to take a directorial time-out and help releasing some special ""Braindead"" edition with loads of extras, I'd advise you to buy the British one. Many editions are uncut, for example German, Dutch and Japanise, but I think British is much more easier to get :)",1134172800,6,1959,4.660869565217391

This movie truly deserves the title as the goriest movie ever made.  This movie crosses all the barriers set by Hollywood and then returns to cover them with gasoline, lights a match and then proceeds to shred it with a blender.

The thing that raises eyebrows the most is that this gorefest was directed by none other than Peter Jackson, the modern day creator of the Lord of the Rings movies.  But if you look at it; that explains why his orks looked so real was because he's had all this experience with zombie movies.  When one watches lord of the rings and then watches this, they may think ""that was a really, really bad movie..."", but at the same time, this is a great movie.  It's a dark comedy, it's not your standard movie, the acting for the most part is supposed to be bad, but presented in a more humorous aspect so to speak.

The gore isn't the style of the Evil Dead, eventually the gore just becomes so over the top that you can't help but laugh.  At one scene a guy shoves a garden gnome into the neck of a headless zombie and at another time the lawnmower is whipped out and slices up all the zombies (it actually spat out 100 pints of blood per minute).  This movie has it all, if you are looking for gore special effects, this movie will astonish you and you'll find yourself asking ""how did they do that?""  It even has Claymation!!!  The plot doesn't matter too much (there barely is one at all) its just ends up as ""Kill all the zombies before they escape the mansion without getting yourself killed in the end"" type of thing.  My friends and I couldn't possibly have had more fun when watching this.  The zombie baby reminded us all of an evil inbred teletubby.  And let's not forget the line said by the preacher which can be titled as the greatest B Movie line ever.  ""I Kick Ass for the Lord!!!""  This hysterical line in then followed by martial arts which you just have to see to understand why it's so funny and my personal favorite part of the movie.

There are three versions however.  The R rated version (skip that, it eliminates a lot of the good scenes), the Not Rated version (that's the version you are looking at right now) and the Brain Dead Version (original title) which isn't sold in the U.S. and if you want to seek out a copy I can only recommend using eBay or something similar.

Of course, even the best directors have to start somewhere. This is a sort of campy, darkly comedic, horror film that suffers from an excess of gore that is extreme and over the top. Notwithstanding this, it has moments of actual promise that eventually simply succumb to the director's excesses.

The story is a simple one and takes place in the nineteen fifties. In Sumatra,  there is a highly unusual creature called a Rat Monkey that looks exactly as it is named. When one is spirited out of the country, despite  the outrage of the local natives, it is the beginning of the end. Unbeknownst to its handlers, a Rat Monkey bite transmits a virus that makes a zombie out of  the bitten entity. Upon arrival in New Zealand, the Rat Monkey is placed in the local zoo.

Meanwhile, a local mama's boy, Lionel (Timothy Balme), meets the luscious Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Penalver), whose ancient crone of a grandmother (Davina Whitehouse) had recently  predicted that Paquita would be meeting  the love of her life. The only problem is that in the Tarot cards her grandmother read, it appears that Paquita's erstwhile lover is surrounded by death.

Paquita, sure that Lionel is the one, does everything possible to ensure that Lionel takes her on a date. Unfortunately, Lionel lives in a mansion with his rich, domineering Mum (Elizabeth Moody). So, when Paquita and Lionel go to the zoo on their first date, dear old Mum arranges to catch up with them at the zoo, only to find herself bitten by the Rat Monkey. Soon after, Mum  finds herself a member of undead.

Lionel calls for Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) to come and tend to Mum, as to him she appears to have fallen strangely ill.  After a run in with Mum's teeth, Nurse McTavish finds herself among the undead, as well. Initially, Lionel has the situation under control, keep the bodies of the undead tranquilized and tied up in the basement.

When, however, his mother is finally declared officially dead and a funeral is arranged , his sleazy , lecherous Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) comes out of the woodwork, looking for a share of Lionel's inheritance. When he goes to the mansion in which Lionel lives, he discovers the undead in the basement. So, he blackmails Lionel. Uncle  Les promises not to notify the police that Lionel has seemingly dead bodies in the basement. In return, Lionel  promises to turn over his mother's mansion and fortune over to Les.

Unfortunately, Les  then throws a big party at the mansion, while the undead are in the basement. When the undead get out, all hell breaks loose, as they start biting and eating  everyone, creating hordes of new undead, which Lionel and Paquita must battle in order to survive.

There are some very funny moments in this campy, offbeat film. The problem is the gore is so over the top that it becomes tiresome. It is certainly not scary. There are some excellent performances by the cast. Elizabeth Moody is wonderful as Mum, and Ian Watkins is quite funny as  Lionel's Uncle Les.  Diana Penalver is excellent in the role of the winsome Paquita, and the rest of the supporting cast is more than adequate for the roles in this film, which consist mostly of letting oneself be torn asunder by the undead.

This is a totally over the top film that has the makings of becoming a cult classic. It is worth a rental for those for whom too much gore is simply not enough.",1119744000,8,3634,4.700315457413249
193293,5,157362408X,"Everyone's got a favorite movie-monster type. Some folks go for the gothic sexuality of the vampire; some are drawn to the Jeykll-n-Hyde torment of the werewolf. Some, perhaps, are in the spirit to love ghosts, and some are compulsively attracted to the exploits of the serial killer (where Freddy and Jason should be included).

Not me. I dig zombies.

Zombie movie-fans, and you know who you are, should be living high on the hog these days. Spurred perhaps by the high-profile (but dreadfully lame) success of Resident Evil, recent offerings range from the gripping 28 Days Later, the energetic remake of George Romero's classic zombie flick Dawn of the Dead, and the smart and snarky Shaun of the Dead. Hell, Romero's even getting back in the act with Land of the Dead mid-2005. Times are good for the undead.

As any good zombie-movie fan knows, there is no zombie film quite like Dead Alive. Dead Alive's formula, for many reasons, has not been attempted before or since. At heart, it's a light-hearted action-comedy-horror film (is there such a thing as an action-comedy-horror film? Did I just make that up?!) with buckets and buckets of gore. Perhaps `tubs' or even `vats' might be a better metaphor - I'm not sure even dedicated film horror fans have ever seen, or wanted to see, this much blood `n' guts before. If you think you can handle it, I highly recommend this one-of-a-kind zombie film.

Simply stated, the gore is what makes Dead Alive great - just when you think director Peter Jackson's cinematography and his FX department couldn't possibly top the last gross-out, over-the-edge gory gag, they do it. And, although there is a copious amount of it, the blood and gore is more cartoony than anything (I'd like to see that offered as an excuse to a network censor). Much of it doesn't seem real, because I can't remember the last time I saw someone eat their own ear, or have the skin on their face pulled completely off, or lose the lower half of their body and still try to attack others. To make matters worse for the squeamish, the gross-out factor is exponentially raised by the sound effects. You don't just see blood spurt, but hear it spurt in audible detail. It's unsettling and viscerally amazing.

As for the nuts and bolts of the film, such as characters, plot and what-not, Dead Alive is like no zombie flick I've ever seen. As such, I won't give away too much. Set in late 40's or early 50's New Zealand, the setting evokes a simpler, far-off time, though this pleasantness eventually comes crashing down as the chaos erupts. The dead-raising affliction comes to town via a vicious rat-monkey, who bites the overbearing society-matron-mother of indecisive homebody Nigel. Mother becomes infected and zombified. Nigel, unsure of what to do, locks her in the basement after she tries to kill him, and events quickly spiral out of control as Nigel wages a one-man-war to suppress the zombies, lest somebody find out about them. But the zombies take care of ""promoting"" themselves, and it's not long before all-out zombie mayhem breaks out.

For those that care about such things, these zombies are loosely based on the Romero-style zombie - they're slow, and jerky, but are very strong and determined to eat you (but not necessarily your brains, a la Return of the Living Dead). When they bite you, you become a zombie. Shots or hits to the head will ""kill"" them, but not always. In some extreme cases, even complete bodily dismemberment won't slow these guys (or gals) down, and their entrails have been known to cause mayhem. And (possibly copied by the Dawn of the Dead remake) zombies can have zombie babies. All in all, a tough, stupid bunch of undead characters.

This is a great zombie film; quaint and inventive at times, flat out disgusting at others, funny and touching in between. If you're even remotely a fan of the zombie genre, the final battle sequence between Nigel and the zombie hordes is worth whatever you paid to sit through two Resident Evil ""films."" As one character puts it, ""Rich and creamy - just the way I like it."" He was talking about custard, but he could have been just as easily talking about this gem of cinematic zombification.",1119052800,3,4193,4.767217630853994

 It's interesting to see the kind of progression he's made from low budget gross out flicks to multi-million dollar FX laden epics, and even more interesting to see that he still has a lot of the same people working with him.

 Of course, this film is more than a low budget gross out flick. Hard to say how much is parody and how much is genuine, but there is a sort of sweetness running through this film, and the protagonists are genuinely sympathetic characters, which only make the gross and gory parts better by way of contrast. Do we need to dwell on the ear chewing and the zombie sex? Possibly, but I'll try and avoid doing it here. The film weaves together sweet and romantic moments, groanworthy villainy, comedy gore, disgusting gore and pure slapstick humour very skilfully, and most importantly very watchably.

193301,5,157362408X,"As any good splatter punk knows, when you want something over the top and beyond reason...look outside the US.  Especially after those loons in Colorado shot up their school.  American horror has been in the dumps.  Although, even before that happened, the Horror genre here was getting pretty stale.  Many of the movies were self serving in-jokes. (This was refreshing in the first Scream movie but after that I got really tired of it) And it would seem these days the best horror we have to offer are either remakes or sequels of classic 80's slashers.  Kind of sad really considering what we are getting from outside the US.  Peter Jackson,(LoTR films) was one of the first foreign directors I noticed.  Dead Alive to me upon the first viewing was a ridiculus spoof.  But I was pretty drunk at the time and wasn't able to fully appreciate it.  Upon my second (sober) veiwing I saw something I had never seen before.  This film took me to the place American horror flicks rarely ever did....that extra half second.

Let me explain,  Aside from the Uncensored George Romero ""Dead"" films...the traditional kill scenes in American horror films only showed kills in quick flashes....the impact of the machette, or the plunge of the claw, or the penetration of the knife etc...Then they'd cut away for an expression on the kill's face...cut to the killer, then show a bloody corpse fall down.

The extra half second I mean is the half second after the machette, claw, or knife hits....Other than the initial attack, the unsettling USE of the weapon.  Yeah we all know that sharp things are lethal...Jason has hacked more people to death than any other on screen killer.  But, you only ever saw so much.  In this film we see what happens after.  That's what makes it so harsh for some people.  And that what makes this a work of art beyond genre films.  Peter Jackson is, dare I say it, the Jackson Pollock of horror.",1111017600,,1913,4.673652694610778

Anyway.

This is Peter Jackson before he got famous.  If you really liked LoTR, be warned that this is NOT LoTR with zombies.  This is Peter Jackson on zombies.  It is revoltingly and shockingly gory, perverse, twisted, and strangely, bafflingly, utterly hilarious.  It is easily one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  Watching Lionel try to take a zombie baby to the park for an afternoon out?  Hysterical!  The gore itself is very funny, as well - it's so ludicrously over-the-top that it's great.  Not only is it ridiculously excessive, it's consistant in quality and very well done.  Really creative cinematography helps, too.  Jackson and his crew knew what they were doing.

I would recommend this to any horror fan without hesitation.  If you're one of the legions of Tolkien fans who found out about Jackson because of LoTR, you may not like this.  I'd try to work my way up to this one in terms of gore, like start out with an entry-level film like Evil Dead 2, then watch Day of the Dead (the end sequence is crazy!) before this bad boy.  If you can handle the gore, Dead Alive is an absolute gem.  Dead Alive stands next to Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Patton, Evil Dead 2, and Shaun of the Dead as the core of my DVD collection, and is an obvious crown jewel in any horror library.

193309,5,157362408X,"Look up the word ""disgusting"" in the unwritten Book Of The Cinema and you'll find that the definition is ""Peter Jackson's 'Braindead'"".  I don't know how else to introduce the picture other than to say that it is believed to be the goriest film ever made, and that it is considered by many to be the best zombie (and even horror in general) film ever made.

The film revolves around Lionel (Timothy Balme), a kind-hearted and loyal young man forced to take care of his wicked old mother (Elizabeth Moody).  When Lionel meets Paquita (Diana Penalver), a girl working at a local shop (who has been foretold that Lionel is her destined love), a romance blooms - angering Lionel's mum, who proceeds to follow the couple on a trip to the zoo.  The story goes from sunny romance to pitch-black horror in an instant when Lionel and Paquita stumble across a bizarre creature in the zoo: the rare Sumatran rat monkey, a vicious little beast with taste for flesh.  In the film's first bloody scene - enough to get the film an ""R"" rating already - Lionel's mum is bitten by the rat monkey.

Naturally, being the very loving son he is, Lionel takes his sick mother home and gives her his undivided attention.  That night Lionel is visited by Paquita, and for a while Lionel forgets about his mum or anything else.

From then on Lionel's life becomes a living hell.  First, his mother dies.  Then, she is resurrected as a zombie and begins losing clumps of skin and an ear.  This doesn't seem good, especially when a respected couple arrive for dinner.  Soon, friends of the family are bitten, or just nibbled on by Lionel's mum - and so they find themselves brainless, undead creatures as well.  Then some of the kind local citizens - including a priest who ""kicks ass for the Lord"" - are zombied.  Finally, most of the town has become zombies.  Things aren't looking good for Lionel, who's trying to keep the whole thing under wraps - pretty much literally.

How much gore could a horror film have if a horror film could have gore?  I don't know, but I'd say ""Braindead"" is about the limit.  People whose stomachs aren't made of rock should steer clear of this film, or any of Jackson's earlier pieces for that matter.  Luckily, I was prepared for the gory festivites after watching ""Bad Taste"", but even then I was surprised when - three minutes into the film - a man finds both his arms and, ultimately, his head cut off in an unflinching scene which gives you no time to blink.  If there ever has been a more gory, disgusting, sick film that ""Braindead"" (or ""Dead Alive"", whichever you prefer), I've yet to see it.

For example, in one scene, Paquita and Lionel hear Paquita's dog bark and attack Lionel's mum.  Rushing upstairs, they find Lionel's mum looking sick.  Lionel goes to her and removes one of the dog's legs from her throat.  (In case you haven't noticed, this is one of the most disturbing scenes in the film)  ""Your mother ate my dog!"" Paquita screams.  ""There's still some left,"" Lionel replies.  We pull back and find the room splattered in blood, with hairy remains on the bed.

Ugh.

""Braindead"" is rated highly most everywhere I've seen it reviewed, hailed by horror fans as a masterpiece.  It is constantly competing with films like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" for superiority in the ""Best Zombie Movie Ever"" category.  I'd say it comes pretty close too.  The film's nightmarish, unflinching atmosphere is something entirely unique to Peter Jackson.  The acting is terrific - you feel exactly what you're supposed to feel when you're supposed to feel it.  The score, by Peter Dasent, is also very fine, and gives the film a mischievous, comedic mood.

""Braindead"" is Peter Jackson's pre-""Rings"" masterpiece, and one of the greatest horror films ever made.  If you, a) have a very endurant stomach, b) call yourself a horror fan, and c) haven't a fear of rat monkeys, then this is the film for you.  No horror moviegoer should go without seeing it at least once.

Sometimes eerie, frequently funny, and always gory as hell, ""Braindead"" is one sick film.",1102723200,2,4103,4.639389736477115

193311,4,157362408X,"As you likely know, if you're reading this, Dead Alive is fairly widely regarded as the goriest movie ever made.  Having not seen every movie ever made I'm not prepared to declare it as such, but it's certainly the goriest movie I've ever seen.  By far.  To give you a bit of perspective, I would say Day of the Dead and Riki-Oh probably come closest of the films I've seen, and Dead Alive has got to be at least 5 times gorier than either of those films.(And that's probably a conservative estimate)  This fact alone should make it mandatory viewing for anyone interested in Horror films.(Of course, this isn't actually a horror film; I don't think it genuinely tries to be scary even once.  But, the gore-comedy is primarily of interest to horror fans, naturally)

As one would expect, this film has it's roots in Re-Animator and the Evil Dead films, but it manages to find it's own style and tone.  Evil Dead II was wildly over-the-top and energetic while Re-Animator was pretty subdued and deadpan much of the time.  Dead Alive, directed by the now highly famed and lauded Peter Jackson, is somewhere in between, certainly not as controlled as Re-Animator, but nowhere near as flat out weird and kinetic as Evil Dead II.(at least not from beginning to end.)  And yeah it's pretty funny, though perhaps the majority of the non-gore related humor tends to fall flat.  It's also more purely good-natured and fun-loving than any of those films.(Perhaps this is related to their New Zealand accents)  I don't know if it's necessarily better than any of those films, it's a tough call, but they're all in the same league, and fans of one ought to like the others.

Inspiration is frequently in short supply in the non-zombie related scenes, but their are enough zombie scenes that it doesn't matter too much.  The characters are extremely broad caricatures, including the cute, naive love interest, the dorky, buttoned down hero, the evil controlling mother and the conniving, greedy and chauvinistic uncle.  Naturally characters don't matter a whole helluva lot in this film, but, for what it's worth, both Paquita and Lionel are reasonably likable as the protagonist.  The film ain't much on plot either, as it's pretty much just a series of comic scenes involving Lionel's attempts to keep the zombie outbreak a secret, and then their collective attempts to simply destroy them.  Personally, I find this structural format to be perfectly fine.  The less plot the better, when it comes to this sort of film.

The gore is so ridiculous and over-the-top that it's hard to imagine how anyone could be offended by it, though it is quite gross at times.  The gore itself particularly reminds of the original Evil Dead, as it emphasizes goo and moistness, and the zombies look fairly reminiscent of the demon-possessed individuals from that film.  Although the gore isn't nor is it trying to be realistic, the execution is often more professional and well done than I would've anticipated.  Going into too many specifics would be terribly time consuming, but their are a few things that demand pointing out.  The single best gore effect would have to be towards the beginning of the film, when the nurse gets her head ripped off. (most of the way, anyway)  And, the much famed lawnmower massacre towards the end of the film is classic, and has some surprisingly nicely done effects to go along with the sheer over-the-top insanity of the scene.(The effects I'm referring, in specific, to some of the shots of the limbs getting shredded into nothingness)  And, the stop-motion animated sumatran rat monkey is quite fun as well.

Yeah, this movie is pretty great.  Not quite the all time highpoint in gore, in my mind, however.  I think that Riki-Oh is funnier on the gore front, and am more impressed by some more serious films that display more realistic gore.  But Dead Alive still does what it does very well.",1100908800,122,3905,4.814092953523239
193312,3,157362408X,"""Dead Alive"" is a quaint little love story set in a small, New Zealand town in the 1950s. It's chock-full of blushing cheeks, batting eyelashes, romantic rendezvous, dancing, kissing, blood, pus, zombies... Oh, did I mention the Sumatran Rat-Monkey? Oh yeah. Apparently, way back when, a bunch of rats rushed off the slave ships and raped the Sumatran monkeys, creating the nastiest critter you've ever seen, and the source of all Lionel and Paquita's troubles. You see, the Sumatran Rat-Monkey carries a horrible virus, or curse, or something, that causes the victims of its painful bite to die a gruesome death and return as flesh eating zombies! And that's just what happens to Lionel's domineering mother! When shy, mamma's boy Lionel takes his foretold of ""true love,"" Paquita, out on their first date to the local zoo, mother follows along. She gets a little too close to the vicious rat-monkey's cage, and it's all downhill from there! Once mother is bitten, she reveals herself to the couple, and the date is over (but not before mister rat-monkey suffers a most gruesome death at mother's feet). At home, Lionel does his best to care for his dear, sweet, old mother, but to no avail. She grows sicker and sicker, and more disgusting, every minute. She's a fighter though, and still does her best to entertain her socially important dinner guests that evening. Prepare for the grossest scene in the movie here folks, when mother serves up a pint of pus and blood in the guests' custard. I'm about to puke at the mere memory of it! Well, the curse spreads fast after this. Mother bites her nurse, a group of local toughs, and a pretty cool preacher dude who ""kicks ass for the Lord,"" and for a while there, he really does! Meanwhile, Lionel acquires some liquid tranquilizer from a nazi doctor in hiding, does his best to fend off his gold-digging uncle, and tries with all his might to keep his secret from Paquita and the other townsfolk. Lionel has the worst luck in the world, however. Uncle finds the zombies in the basement, zombie nurse and zombie preacher have fornicated and procreated (leading to some hilarious antics from the ugliest baby you've ever seen), and now, Lionel has to keep his secret from all the party-goers his dear uncle has invited to dance the night away! Here's where things really get out of hand! The blood flows from vats as Lionel and the other survivors chop their way through his house of horrors, most of them becoming zombies along the way. Well, at least he already injected his mother with an unhealthy dose of poison up the nose. No! Wait! That wasn't poison! It was animal growth hormones! Now she's bigger and badder than ever! Even if Lionel does survive the gory orgy underway throughout the house, he still has to deal with Mother!

""Dead Alive"" has GOT to be the goriest, and possibly the grossest movie to date! This is from the Oscar Winning director of Lord of the Rings? Apparently so, and as recently as 1992! With strong shades of ""Return of the Living Dead"" and the ""Evil Dead"" series, Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" has a look and feel all its own. Gory and gross to the extreme, you'll want to avoid this if you have a weak stomach. Not sure how I made it through that custard scene! The cast is great, especially stars Timothy Balme (Lionel) and Diana Penalver (Paquita), who give it some real humor and heart. In fact, ""Dead Alive"" is probably more comedy than horror. The scenes with the zombie baby will really break you up! Loved the butt-kicking preacher too. It's kind of a shame he got killed off! ""Dead Alive"" is a must for any fans of screwball horror-comedy and gore, or anyone looking for a glimpse into the mind of the real Peter Jackson.

Dead Alive has a permanent spot in my Horror Top 10.  If you have a problem with dismemberment, fake blood, or albino primate/rodent hybrids from Skull Island, well you should still watch this movie.  Hilarious, disgusting, with tons of how'd they do that shots.  Jackson is a twisted, deranged madman and here's the proof.

Dead Alive redefined over the top gore and has yet to be matched.  Whether it's punching through a lady's face, mowing down party going zombies, or returning at last to a mother's womb, this movie will have you laughing non-stop and then doing double takes because of all the insane sight gags. A classic that needs better dvd treatment.

This film's story line, along with its subtle cinematography, and abrasive chopping horror style, proves that Jackson is definatly one of the most diverse Directors working in the film industry.

 Dubbed ""the goriest fright film of all time"" this film does not hold back at all and lives up to this tag that has been put on it.

 Word to the wise, stay away from thr R rated version it does no justice to Jackson's masterpeice of gore as it cuts away when something juicy is about to happen, I strongly recommend the unrated version or if you can find it the Brain dead version, it adds about 7-10 minutes onto the film's running time.",1094083200,,679,4.2

 The gore is over the top. "" Dead Alive"" is, without a doubt, the goriest film I have ever had the pleasure to watch. For the most part, the special effects are top notch; a couple times, the effects are a little disappointing. But overall, I was quite impressed with how this film was done. I admit, there were even a couple moments that made me squeamish. I don't think I'll ever look at pudding the same way again.

I caught the film on cable last night and it hasn't lost its shock and awe after repeated viewings. One thing people always seem to forget is that Jackson's Dead Alive is also one of the funniest horror films out there. Where Romero's zombie films piled dread upon dread until one is almost smothered by it, Jackson balances the grand guignol looks of his film by injecting a hefty load of humor and classic one-liners.

 It's such a surprise that someone who made Dead Alive also ended up creating the definitive fantasy-trilogy that everyone is now gunning for: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I just hope that Jackson can take time after filming King Kong to get back to his roots and make another film in the same vein as Dead Alive. Especially now that Romero has gotten the money to film the fourth film in his Dead Saga, zombies are now the ""in"" monsters of horror cinema.",1091404800,6,1044,4.60752688172043
193319,4,157362408X,"Dead Alive, one of the first films by Peter Jackson, (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""Heavenly Creatures"") is without a doubt the goriest movie I have ever seen. And I've been a fan of horror films and gross-out splatter movies long enough to have gone through most of the horror section at my local independent video store, and a sizable chunk of 'Videohound's Horror Show' book, which by the way, is a wonderful guide to 999 horror flicks.

 But no other movie that I can think of even comes close to offering up as much blood and guts as ""Dead Alive"" does in its last twenty minutes alone.

 Anyway, Dead Alive takes place in a small New Zealand town, where a dangerous 'rat-monkey' has recently been moved to the local zoo. It bites our hero's mother, and she turns into a zombie, and from there, you can probably guess how things spiral out of control, with more and more of the townsfolk being infected.

 Some might consider this movie to be horror, but above all else, I think it's a comedy. The gore effects are the real stars here, although the acting isn't half bad for a movie of this kind. Peter Jackson is a skilled director, and I just wish that a new DVD will be available soon where he offers audio commentary, since the current DVD has no extras to speak of other than a trailer.

 However, if you are squeamish in the least bit, steer clear of this one. The gore is over the top, sure, and quite comical if you can handle it, but if you can't, you are in for some intense stuff. I won't ruin any of it for any of you, but splatter movie fans should definitely check this out. Just make sure to get the unrated version, bceuase, from what I hear the R-rated version has many minutes of gore cut out.",1091318400,2,1715,4.3375
193320,5,157362408X,"I read last year in Entertainment Weekly that Freddy Vs. Jason (great film, see my review) was supposed to be one of the bloodiest horror movies ever (this was before it came out, mind you). Even before that I heard that Braveheart was one of the goriest movies to ever be released. Unfortunately it seems that everyone was ignoring the glorious director of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Peter Jackson's older movies, because if they had seen them, every other film (horror or not) would have been SLAMMED by Dead/Alive!

 This is the kind of movie that makes your mother leave the room, your girlfriend (or boyfriend) question your mental status, and your friends not answer the door when the pizza arrives. True gore fans (like me, who eats sloppy bean burritos from Taco Bell while watching Faces Of Death), will absolutely love some of the choice scenes that make this film so great. I remember talking to a friend and they said that a large portion of the budget (it was in the 10's of thousands of dollars) went to fake blood alone! You little hobbit-loving director also has a thing for blood and gore!

 The plot is pretty simple, a rat monkey from some foreign cave is captured and brought back to a zoo in England. It's already clear from the first scene that you DO NOT want to get bitten by this creature. Of course, some little twitty guy and his overbearing abusive mother go to the zoo and wench gets bitten. Over the course of the next few weeks, she slowly decomposes and eventually dies. Of course the son now knows that she's not dead and that she's undead and everyone she bites ends up becoming a zombie as well. This stays relatively low key with only a few zombies in the basement until a large party is thrown in his house and before you know it everything is swarming with bloodthirsty zombies and it's up to the son to take care of business.

This movie is for any cult horror fan and anyone who can stomach it!  This Unrated edition is also the only cut worth seeing (the R-rated version is useless) and although there aren't really special features, the movie still makes up for it.  I bought this at $24.99 and felt like I definitely got my money's worth, at this price it's a steal!",1091232000,2,2212,4.487562189054726

I've seen probably every gory movie, (Zombie, Dawn of the Dead, Bad Taste) and this is definately the goriest i've seen. You have to wait just a few minutes for the gore to start, but once ol' mum gets bit by the rat monkey, get a rain coat and an umbrella because its raining blood! After she's bit, there's a rather hilarious zombie baby, a nice rib cage rip-out, and a truly amazing must-see lawnmower scene, (very original.) There are also other cool parts that involve blenders, pudding, and even living intestines.

I thought it was more of a spoof-satire-sarcastic statement on how horror movies had degenerated since Halloween in 1978. I forget about it over the years and when Lord of the Rings came out and I heard the director's name my ears perked up. I couldn't place him, but I knew I'd seen Jackson's stuff before. Then I heard a blip about this movie and I was stunned that he made Dead Alive, and something as beautiful as the LOTR Trilogy.
Dead Alive is a great movie if you just want to kickback, laugh, gross yourself out, and potentially thorw up everything you've ever eaten. Like the baby food mom fed you when you were a wee-thing. I would rent it first, though, before you buy it.

193325,4,157362408X,"Last week I returned from a meeting to find some movies awaiting me.  One of them was Dead Alive.  Dead Alive is a very silly film involving unstoppable zombies and a son's devotion to his mother with a healthy splash of love story.
The movie opens on Skull Island (home of King Kong, remember?) where a trapper is trying to get out with a captured monkey.  The natives do not like the idea.  We are then treated to the idea that if the monkey bites you then you have the bitten area amputated.
Enter a young Latin woman whose grandmother tells her future and that she will meet the man of her dreams very shortly.  That man lives with his mother, a very distasteful woman.  She spies on the two at a local zoo where they have just seen the Rat Monkey, a truly ugly specimen brought to life with stop motion animation.  The monkey bites the mother and the movie is really underway; like a roller coaster.
Mother becomes even meaner and uglier and dies.  But she won't stay down.  Neither will anyone she kills.  The son tries to keep it under control but the intervention of a greedy uncle really complicates matters.
The remainder is a really silly gore fest as the son gets things back in some semblance of order and the hundred zombies are stopped with some more interesting stop motion animation.

The performances are dead on, there are some wonderful characters, (including a kung fu-fighting priest who declares, ""I kick ass for the Lord!"" before kicking some serious zombie booty)and the style and art direction are flawlessly executed.  It's just one of those movies where you can tell that a vision was truly realized.  This is a Peter Jackson film after all (let's all forget about The Fighteners.)

The movie plot has some striking similarities with Lucio Fulci`s and Romero`s versions - the zombie bitten part starts to degenerate and you turn into a zombie. The zombies try to attack everything that moves and it is extremely difficult to kill them. Even more difficult in ""Dead alive"".
It doesn`t help to saw of the zombies head - every body parts, including the fingers and even the hairs must be chopped in pieces - and it is here that the plainclipper comes in handy!!
Otherwise the goreness level of this movie is simply extreme. I bet it`s even gorier and bloodier than both ""Evil dead"" and ""Aliens"". There is so much blood dripping, slim and other body fluids flying all over the place that you can hardly wait to the end; you start looking around for a WC to take a nice and releasing vomit!!
This movie will certainly reduce your appetite for days to come. Particulary the disgusting eating scenes, where they eat a pudding dripped in slim and blood will do the job.. Ew!!

After ""Meet the Feebles,"" all is forgiven with ""Dead Alive,"" a no-holds-barred-or-even-considered zombie flick/love story/Freudian drama/splatter-fest. I had heard so much about ""Dead Alive"" before I watched it that I was a little disappointed to discover that it's basically a zombie flick (the cinematic equivalent of a shoot-em-up videogame), but all disappointment fell away once I let Jackson's thoroughly corrupt and hilarious vision take over.
""Dead Alive"" has your basic zombieplot (or zombie situation, I guess), but it has some wonderful twists - one, that our hero's mother, an evil, oppressive witch-with-a-capital-b, becomes essentially the head zombie, leading to a climax where our hero must face down his Freudian fears to defeat her. Two, there's a charming love story buried in all the gore. Three, Jackson finds some of the darkest, blackest slapstick humor imaginable, as his zombies - and their entrails - do that thing that they do.
And oh, the payoff! So many movies botch the big ending, but the final third of ""Dead Alive"" is an absolutely anarchic comic nightmare, as our heroes must defend themselves from scores of party-hungry zombies (including a zombie baby muppet - maybe a bit too much, but you can't deny Jackson his indulgences). Disgusting & corrupt? Oh, absolutely. A damned good time? You bet.
Oh, and ""Dead Alive"" has a satisfying answer to the eternal question: ""How do you kill something that's already dead, anyway?"" The logical answer: ""Grind it to a pulp, that's how.""",1078531200,,1542,5.196787148594377

Now those same people are sitting jaw-smacked in front of the big screen as Gollum walks and talks like a real living thing.
Peter Jackson has made the ultimate comedy gore movie. The concept for this genre was based on Jackson wanting nothing more than to see Pinhead from ""Hellraiser"" fall on his face, so he went off and made his own brand of comedy gore. The end result is nothing short of sheer madness and you just wish that more indie film-makers would be granted the capital and funds to realize what is on their mind onto the screen.
This film is sick and twisted but remarkably tongue and cheek and very funny. Here there is every gag in the book from ""babies in a blender"" to ""granny abuse"". This is as a black as humour gets but also completely outrageously funny in a Buster Keaton/Three Stooges sort of way. The scenes with the Kung-Fu priest stand out as one of the funniest horror events ever filmed. The baby abuse in the park is just plain whacked in the head and a funeral turns out in the worst possible way imaginable.
The premise is simple. Lionel's mum is a cruel woman who dominates him. When she is bitten by a ""Rat-Monkey"" (my god you have to hear the story behind that thing) she turns into the living dead. Lionel keeps her locked up in the cellar but all hell breaks loose during a house party that turns into one of the bloodiest and goriest scenes ever committed to colloid.

The gags, as they were, are really just long, drawn out scenes of shameless cartoon violence, and i was really turned off by the whole thing. The idiots who edited the US version basically butchered all of the violence, making almost the entire final twenty minutes nearly incomprehensible, or maybe it was due to the nothing-budget, i'm not really sure because it hardly ever shows much of anything.
The best way to describe this film is like putting a frog in a blender and then trying, through heavy, thick beer goggles of some sort, to watch the horrid thing spin around in juicy, revolting agony.

Jackson's frenetic energy, over the top gore, and truly tasteless behavior had me running out to look for some of his other films. ""Bad Taste"" and ""Meet the Feebles,"" his other early efforts, are just as entertaining in uniquely sick ways but lack the visceral impact of this cult classic. We all know what director Jackson is doing now; he's turning into a cinematic legend with his phenomenal ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation. It amuses me to no end that there are still people out there praising this amazing visionary without seeing his early work. I had the chance a few years ago to introduce one of these unknowing souls to ""Dead Alive"" and the look on their face was worth any amount of money. Hey, they wanted to see a Peter Jackson film, and so they did!

""Dead Alive"" opens with a scientific expedition's discovery of the ultra rare rat monkey; a repulsive, vicious creature whose bite is definitely worse than its bark. The expedition rapidly descends into anarchy when some local natives insist on keeping the monkey. The scientists manage to escape with the abomination, but not before the monkey bites one of the explorers. When two of the tour guides with him notice this wound, they promptly chop his hand off. Something, apparently, is seriously wrong about receiving any sort of attention from this nasty little beastie. Of course, that doesn't stop the expedition from tossing the monkey in a crate and shipping it off to a zoo in a major city.
Flash forward a number of years to the present, where we rapidly meet Lionel Cosgrove, his mother Vera, and Paquita Maria Sanchez, the three main characters of the movie. Lionel is one of those guys who caters to his mother's every whim. Ever since his father died-a subplot that eventually finds resolution towards the end of the movie-Lionel has doted on his overbearing, obnoxiously vocal mother. Vera Cosgrove knows that her behavior doesn't help her son achieve any sort of independence, but she simply doesn't care because by dominating her son she gives expression to her desire to control other people's lives. Lionel's life as a momma's boy would probably have gone on indefinitely if he had not suddenly met Paquita, a spicy little number who works at the local grocery store. Paquita is quite the spiritual person, and is absolutely elated after her grandmother sifts through some tarot cards and informs her granddaughter that she's about to meet the man of her dreams. Predictably, Paquita runs (literally) into Lionel and sees several signs that convince her this nervous nelly is the man of her dreams. When Paquita attempts to establish a relationship with Lionel, Vera Cosgrove feels threatened and does her best to quash the burgeoning romance. When Lionel and Paquita go to the zoo on a first date, mother Cosgrove follows to spy on the two. Regrettably, in her haste to see what her son is doing, Vera accidentally receives the toothy attentions of the little rat monkey. From this point forward, ""Dead Alive"" descends into a gross out gorefest.
Vera begins to literally melt to death from the monkey bite while a panicked Lionel has no idea what to do. After a scene that will give you a life long phobia about eating pudding, along with another unpleasant situation involving a dog and Vera's suddenly voracious appetite, Lionel and Paquita decide to call for medical assistance. Things get very icky from this point on, as various characters including a nurse, the local priest, Lionel's uncle, and a bunch of townspeople fall victim to the nightmare unfolding at the Cosgrove residence. It seems that the bite of the rat monkey not only causes problems for the initial victim (in this case, Vera Cosgrove), but can also spread when that victim attacks other people. What you get are dozens of shambling zombies looking to turn the living into jigsaw puzzles. The last twenty odd minutes of the film are a marathon of bloodshed, as Lionel and Paquita attempt to destroy the hungry creatures roaming through the halls of Castle Cosgrove. You've never seen oceans of gore this deep in any film, rest assured, or the inventive techniques Jackson developed to make his film a memorable experience. Lawnmowers used to kill zombies, heads spinning in blenders, a pile of murderous organs, and a transmogrified Vera Cosgrove are just a few of the mind blasting things you will see in ""Dead Alive."" This is jaw dropping stuff, made slightly more palatable by the significant doses of humor injected into the whole thing. If Jackson made this just to be cruel, it would be unwatchable. Instead, the movie allows you to laugh even as it turns your stomach.
Avoid the 'R' rated version! All of the sauce is missing from that edition! Watch the unrated version, or better yet find the uncut print under the title of ""Braindead,"" which contains seven minutes of additional footage. We really need to see a disc with all the trimmings, though, such as a commentary from Jackson and any other extras that might exist. I hope the director finds time to revisit this territory again, but with the fame he has garnered from ""Lord of the Rings"" and his remake of ""King Kong"" due sometime in 2005, I fear that Jackson's will never return to his groundbreaking early days. Hopefully, I am wrong.",1069200000,4,5708,4.837423312883436
193341,5,157362408X,"Simply the goriest, funniest, sickest, and silliest horror flick ever made! I love it. It's so unbelievably funny. If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based drama Heavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort. If you find this kind of thing even remotely appealing, consider Dead Alive a must-see movie. BLOOD, GORE, CHEEZE, AND FUN!",1067040000,4,1405,5.390909090909091
193342,5,157362408X,"Peter Jackson was king of the splatter horror movies time before the Lord of the Kings trilogy. He made two classic films called Bad Taste and Dead Alive. In my opinion, Dead Alive is a little bit better than Bad Taste, which is also a great and funny movie. The movie's main character is a poor chmuch named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when Mom gets bitten by a rage and poisonous rat monkey(which is one my favourite creatures in this film) from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh eating zombie. If you don't like The Lord of the Rings movies and you'll love this if you have a really sick sense of homour and splatter horror movies are you favourites. There are many unforgettable highlights on this film for exemple these three: - Flesh eating mother zombie is walking on the middle of the road. Suddenly, streettrain drives over her and mother flies over 20 meters.
 - Zombie is eating soap and his ear drop to soap. He eats his owns ear!
- Rat monkey makes his own extraordinary and funny noise on the zoo.
 I almost died when I watched this movie because Dead Alive was so laughing movie.

193343,5,157362408X,"This New Zealand cult classic certinly lives up to its reputation. However, the movie is so outrageous and over-the-top
it is really hard to be offended by the violence and gore; one
is more amused that shocked. I found Clive Barker's Hellraiser II
and Joe D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness far more shocking, even
though these movies were far less ""explicit."" It is often the
context that violent acts occur in movies make them offensive;
not just their frequency and explicitness. Music, mood, and other
factors contribute to this. At any rate, the movie was very enjoyable - heads chopped up in blenders, lawnmowers slicing through killer zombies, and enough decapitations to put CALIGULA
to shame. Several funny parts are memorable. The protaganist,
Lionel, turns the photograph of Queen Elizabeth II to the wall
when the zombies are being slaughtered as not to offend ""her Majesty."" At the beginning of the film Lionel needs to obtain
tranquilizers from a chemist's lab to control the monsters that
are ""living"" at hi house. The chemist complains about being
persecuted by the immigration officials; he has a heavy accent
a shaved head, and a Swastika armband he is wearing can be scene
on the edge of the screen. Dr. Strangelove ""a la Kiwi.""

193344,4,157362408X,"You might come in with the wrong expectations for this movie, it's primarily reputation is for it's gore. Which is deserved, even in the more widely available slightly-tamed down version that's more commonly available in the US, by the end of the film nearly every inch of the screen is covered in blood and guts. But don't neccesarily expect something frightening because of this, the movie is overall more funny than scary, from the ridiculous premise for the zombies' origin (a cursed Samarian rat-monkey imported to New Zealand) to the myriad bizarre and quirky characters and of course a lot of gross-out humor. At times it almost resembles what would happen if Monty Python made a zombie movie and ran as far with the blood and gore as they possibly could.
You'll enjoy this movie if the following apply to you:
1) the phrases ""karate priest"", ""baby zombie"", and ""rat-monkey"" piqued your interest.
2) You liked Evil Dead II and Army Of Darkness, and are definitely not in the camp that the series went downhill once Sam Raimi started adding in comic elements

193345,5,157362408X,"I had the pleasure of experiencing Peter Jackson before Lord of the Rings made him a huge, mainstream director. Before Heavenly Creatures garnered him critical acclaim and before he was nominated as Best Director for Fellowship of the Ring, ol' Pete was most well known for his gory horror classics Dead Alive (a.k.a. Braindead) and Bad Taste. It's nice to know that rising from these humble beginnings, Peter Jackson is on track to become the most popular director of the 21st century.
Dead Alive has been called ""the goriest movie ever"", and it earns this reputation beautifully. The most is not just gory; it's HYSTERICALLY gory. We're talking buckets of blood, zombies dispatched by a lawnmower, rampaging intestines, and also (for the ladies) some zombie sex thrown into the mix. I can't stress how gory this movie is; you must see it to believe it. In case you're worried this may turn off some of your buddies, none of the gore is very realistic, so it's easy to not take the carnage seriously.
After poor Lionel's mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey, she begins to act in progressively more bizarre ways. In one scene, she eats Lionel's girlfriend's dog.
""Your mother ate my dog!"" his girlfriend cries. Lionel pulls the dog's tail out of his mother's mouth and replies, ""Not all of it.""
His mother's disease begins to spread, and later in the film, Lionel is accosted by some zombies in a graveyard. A priest appears, sees the zombies, and cries, ""This calls for some divine intervention!"" He then leaps at the zombies and proceeds to kickbox them. He proclaims, ""I kick arse for the Lord!""
If you're laughing now, then this movie is for you. If not, you can probably pass. The movie is in no way scary, but it's not really meant to be. It's light humor and zany zombie antics are infectious. Peter Jackson's so-bad-its-hilariously-good taste and sense of humor is on full display in this movie. I love it!
This movie is perfect for a late-night horror or gore movie marathon with your friends. If you're looking for some crazy fun and gross-out humor, Dead Alive is a movie you cannot pass up. You'll be talking about it for years.

193353,5,157362408X,"There are something like 230 or so reviews of this film already entered here, the basic plot and best lines of dialog spoiled for all who haven't seen the film yet, and it seems every other would-be Ebert has made the comment (as if they were the first to say so) that the movie was made by the same guy who made ""Lord of the Rings.""  If you've gone through the trouble of looking up ""Dead/Alive,"" we'll just assume you already know that A)it was made by Peter Jackson, Uber-Kiwi; B)it is heavily laden with blood and gore; and C)there are a half-dozen different versions of varying length.  This is a good place to start.  Now, for what you need to know.
1.  As aforementioned, this is NOT a movie for sensitive viewers.  Keep in mind, my delicate friend, the active descriptive terms used in relation to this movie, particularly ""gore"" and ""splatter.""  The very fact that it is well-nigh impossible (or at least exceedingly difficult) to acquire a totally-uncut version of this film in America (land of the brave & free, indeed!) ought to be a tipoff, especially when there's no nudity or spoken obscenity in the film.
2.  Also as aforementioned, there are a few alternate cut versions of the film.  At this writing, the best available version in America is the 97 minute, Unrated version.  Be a good American & insist on this version, unless you can be a better one & travel to NZ to find the complete version.....
3. In regards to the 97 min. DVD, ignore all the descriptive terms used on the package.  You'll notice words like ""fright"" and ""horror,"" but nowhere on the box will you find ""comic"" or ""absurd,"" which more accurately describe the film; similarly, you'll see the phrase ""state-of-the-art special effects.""  Sure, they're state-of-the-art, for a bargain-basement budget, but don't go into this thing expecting blue screen and CGI or anything remotely on the level of Industrial Light & Magic quality.  You will be disappointed on that score.
4.  Lastly, just remember this is at its core a good-natured, fun-loving movie, obviously made by folks of the same temperament who felt that ""Evil Dead 2"" needed a love story & ""The Re-Animator"" needed to be sillier.

The only reason it exists is to add some humor to the bloody gore-fest that erupts and since it's discussed so often, it isn't necessary to repeat again.  Basically, there will be two reasons you would want to see DEAD ALIVE. The most obvious reason is if you're a fan of movies with a lot of blood, guts, and gore.  DEAD ALIVE is the goriest film of all time (the lawnmower scene alone takes at least five minutes). For example, people are literally eaten alive and in full detail; a zombie is skinned alive but his bowels continue to live on and attempt to kill more live flesh; a zombie has his head turned into a lightbulb. If you like watching stuff like that, then this film is definitely for you (and if you have a weak stomach you should stay away at all costs). The other reason you may want to watch DEAD ALIVE is if you're a Peter Jackson fan. This is one of Jackson's earlier films and has become an important part of his filmography (but if you like Jackson, but have a weak stomach, don't watch this movie). Overall, DEAD ALIVE is the goriest film of all time and it contains a lot of humor (such as the Kung-Fu priest) but of the morbid and perverse kind.

193367,4,157362408X,"This is one of those films people either love or hate. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground for a movie of this calibre. Peter Jackson, the film's director, deserves kudos for successfully walking that very tricky tightrope of balancing horror and comedy.
The film revolves around Lionel, a young man who's life is controlled by his very domineering mother. After ""Mum"" is bitten by a rare rat monkey, she dies and turns into a flesh eating zombie. Lionel then attempts to care for his increasingly decaying mother while trying to keep this particular ""family skeleton"" in the closet. His efforts, however, are hampered by his mother's growing number of victims (all of which Lionel also attempts to hide while fending off their attacks) as well as a greedy uncle who wants to get his hands on Lionel's inheritance. Lionel's one ally is Paquita, a young woman who believes Lionel is her one true love. When Lionel's uncle discovers the coven of living dead in the basement, he blackmails Lionel into handing over his entire inheritance to him. This sets the stage for what has to be the bloodiest finale in film history.
Although this sounds like your traditional ""hard-core"" horror flick, the story is crammed with sophmoric humor, sight gags and just plain light-hearted silliness. The entire cast play their roles with tongue planted firmly in cheek, never taking the material too seriously. Jackson and company are clearly having fun with this movie. The film is completely successful in intergrating the horror and comedy elements, which is no small feat since those are two genres which don't normally go hand in hand. The film's comedy actually makes the gore easier to take. Lionel's ingenious use of the lawn mower is inspired. The finale features a reverse C-section that has to be seen to be believed.
Jackson's debut film ""Bad Taste"" is quite similar to this movie but in ""Dead Alive"", Jackson displays a much stronger style and flair. It's clear when comparing the two films that Jackson has learned a lot and developed a stronger sense of confidence in helming a film. This film may not be for the squeamish, but for anyone else, all you have to do is turn off your brain and have a good time. The reason I gave this a 4-star rating instead of 5 has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather with the DVD which does not provide any extras other than the basics that come with most DVDs.",1048291200,,2412,4.745238095238095

But its obvious many of the hallmarks of his style can be seen in all his films : Jerky but focused camera angles used for comedic effect, dry humor that gets funnier the more you think of it, a very exploitative style of filmaking, and so on. I have never seen a film of Peter Jackson that I didn't like. Some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen are in this and his debut, ""Bad Taste"".

I am very confident in saying this is the most gore filled movie ever. If you have a strong stomache and like weird dark humour this movie is deffenetly for you. and if you watched it and didn't like it at least you can boast about having watched the goreist movie of all time (I'm not jokeing, there's a lot of gore)

They go out to the zoo, and his mum follows them. She gets bit by this rat monkey (who turns people into zombies) which is what the whole beginning scene is about. Basically she infects a nurse and this gang group, and hte only way lionely keeps her down is with tranquilizers from the a Vetrinarian. This makes for the best scene in the move, ""THIS CALLS FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION!""

193378,4,157362408X,"On first watching Dead Alive you're bowled over by the, and there's no other word for it, grossness of it all.  Detailing the life of 25 year-old virgin Lionel as his forrays into love with the beautiful Paquita, who works at the local grocery store, turn into horror and nightmare, this is a gore-fest in the best sense of the word.  As his mother's jealousy almost forces Lionel to break it off with Paquita, Mom is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey which turns her into a hideous zombie that craves human flesh.  As she begins turning the local population into an army of the undead, Lionel must contend with winning over Paquita and putting off his greedy uncle who, believing Lionel's mother to be dead, is intent on gaining the house as part of his inheritance.
The funniest scenes are probably early on, as Lionel's mother (played by Elizabeth Moody, obviously a very good sport) transforms into a zombie, and among other things eats her own ear.  This is the kind of outrageous humour that is the making of any cult classic, and true to form Dead Alive (aka Braindead) has quite a cult following.  The scenes where Lionel desperately attempts to seat down 4 zombies for a regular meal is hilarious, as is the priceless sermon-spouting kung-fu-trained priest.  The finale comes in a welcoming part Lionel's uncle throws, and if blood, guts and gore aren't your thing then you should really not be watching it because a floor slicked in blood and images such a zombie's head lit from the inside will have you crawling for the exits.  For the rest of us though this is a fantastic genre piece of uncontrolled comic horror.
Perhaps what's most remarkable though is that Dead Alive marks a radical difference from Peter Jackson's later movies, Heavenly Creatures and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  However, the relish that the director puts into his visuals is perfectly apparent here.  For anyone who's seen Heavenly Creatures (surely one of the best films made in the 90's) there's also a bit of fun to be had in recognising Lionel's house as being an amalgamation of Juliet and Pauline's houses from the film, as well as John popping up as Void the zombie, and Elizabeth Moody's startling turn as Mom where she played a French teacher in Heavenly Creatures.  Although this may not be as perfectly accomplised as Jackson's later movies, it's nonetheless a very good horror flick indeed that deserves every little bit of its cult status.",1043280000,2,2440,4.747044917257683

Fans of Evil Dead will definitely enjoy this movie, as its similar material, just a bit funnier and much more over-the-top.  The gore is so excessive it is almost comic, especially towards the end, but still, steer clear unless you have a strong stomach.

Set in Wellington NZ in the 1960's, it is a real period piece and this adds to the film's character. It has enough comic book images to make it a great splatter movie and still watchable (& funny). Classic lines like: ""your Mother ate my dog"" and ""I kick...for the Lord"" rank right up there with: ""groovy"" and ""bastards, those bastards"" (zombie fans will know these).
I first heard of Braindead at it's theatrical release in Oz and instantly became a fan of PJ. The camera angles, attention to detail, characterizations and above all tongue-in-cheek humour have made me tell all my friends about my favourite director and movie long before Heavenly Creatures, The Frighteners & LOTR were made. If you want to experience more of PJ's work try Bad Taste or the obscure ""Forgotten Silver"" - his version of Spinal Tap.

This is not a nonsense movie, the story itself is very good - it is about a poor guy who is so controlled by his mother, who at the same time is engaged in a romance with a girl.  Towards the ending, he is actually fighting with the biggest monster in his life - his own mother - very interesting.
There are plenty of blood and gore, and amazing, the special effect are very good.  Moreover, there are plenty of (black) humors that in another way, you can treat this as a comedy.  I will say this is much better than Return of the Living Dead.

Braindead is the version you want, it helps make the film more coherent, as well as keep things more lively.  Some of the jokes which seemed lacking were due to the sceen juxtaposition in the DVD and worse yet the R rated version.
I got my copy of Braindead from Blacketst heart which has unfortunately gone under.  The only way I know of to get this title is to order overseas from NZ or get the Japanese laserdisc.

This movie is a treat. Its not scary or anything but it wasn't meant to be. When i first saw the rat monkey i laughed hysterically. Nonetheless, the movie is drowning in gore. For the first half hour or so, its rather tame as the plot develops but then the mounds of entrails and severed parts begin to add up. For the final 30 minutes, the blood runs in rivers as zombie and human face off in a battle of epic proportions.

Soon half the neighborhood is zombified, and Lionel and his new girlfriend have no choice but to get medieval, using lawn-mowers, knives, light-bulbs, and whatever else they can get their hands on....

When dear old mom is bitten by an abominable rat-creature from an exotic land (and of kooky heritage), things get very, very strange. I'll avoid mentioning the plentiful pre-Farelly Brothers gross-out gags, the bizarrely inventive zombie variations, the nutty characters that would be right at home in ""Dr. Strangelove"", and even the specifics of the stunning make-up effects. I will however warn the faint of heart that there are points toward the end of this movie where nearly every square inch of your television screen will be covered in blood, intestines, scalps, teeth, assorted bone, and other unpleasantries. On the other hand, everything about this flick is so over-the-top and comical, the carnage has no psychological impact whatsoever. In fact, the whole movie is as comperable to the ""Looney Tunes"" of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones as it is to the work of Romero and Raimi.

Gruesome highlights include the lunch scene with zombie mother and guests, two zombies getting it on, resulting with a zombie baby, and there's always the ending scene- a lawnmower blood-bath. Also, I will never forget my all-time favourite scene where the lead, Lionel, takes the zombie baby to the park. (I heard they had a 20 minute gap to fill??) This excursion had him pushing the baby around in a barbed-wire pram, until it escaped and had poor Lionel chasing a midget-disguised baby around the park. I absolutely loved it.

193416,5,157362408X,"Most people in the public at large now know Peter Jackson for his amazing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, and his upcommig latter two installments. His older movies, laced with devilish wit, extreme violence, and original plots are definitely worth taking a look at.
The story is about a young man with an overbearing mother, your typical dysfunctional family with a tainted history. One day, when her son is on a date at the zoo, she follows them and is bitten by the zoo's most gruesome and  unusual display, a ""Rat Monkey"" (the offspring of foreign rats mating with tree monkeys).
Without giving too many details away, the results are horrific. The amount of violence in this movie is extreme, but done so in a way that is more silly than horrifying. Graphic as it is, it is all part of the fun. People who are sensitive to blood and gore should probably avoid this movie all the same.
The ""Dead Alive"" DVD is worth getting mainly because it contains the Unrated version, which is the only way to see this movie. Where I live, the Unrated version was not available on video, so the DVD was a great find. The ""R"" version in question is not worth taking a second look at, since it is extremely watered down, and much of the satirical fun is removed. The DVD has the standard DVD functions, such as subtitles and widescreen. A bit lacking in the extra features department, but I am not complaining.
If you are curious about Jackson's older movies, this is definitely one of his best. I would recommend watching this with ""Meet the Feebles"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"". It would be one unusual film fest. Enjoy.",1020816000,3,1602,4.581881533101045

There are some inventive ways in which fans of the genre will like but the violence in the movie is like a live action tom and jerry cartoon where jerry is some guy with a lawnmower strapped to him self where tom is a bunch of zombies that are shredded by the mower. i will recomend this movie to people who are sissys and have weak stomachs, but for hardcore gore fans don't waste your time and money",1018224000,,730,3.9727891156462585

These movies, however, are merely kindergarden class to this blood drenched classic. All the reviews I've read say this is probably the goriest movie in history. I'd have to agree with that sentiment.
The story about a young, shy man named Lionel(Timothy Balme) who takes care of his domineering mother. Lionel meets up with a young woman in a little store named Pakita. She persues Lionel and gets him to accompany her to the zoo. While spying on the couple Lionel's mother is bitten by the Sumatran Rat Monkey. After being infected with the bite she becomes a hideous undead creature. Lionel, however still takes the time to care for her and all of the others that will become infected with this disease.
If your looking for a frightful movie then this movie would not be for you. The storyline is weak but when you have so much blood, gore and guts on the screen do you really care about a story? This is definitely the goriest movie ever made. Scenes include a rib cage being pulled out, plenty of body dismemberment and the best scene, chopping up dozens of zombies with a lawnmower plus much more. This movie splills more blood than the elevator scene in Stephen King's The Shining. Just describing these scenes and talking about the movie gives it no justice in just how gorey it is.

The best parody succeeds, at least in part, as an example of that which it is spoofing, and Dead Alive does that, mostly due to the fact that Peter Jackson is so immensely talented, and to the fact (well, belief of mine, anyway) that the film is as much of an homage to the zombie flick as anything else.
Short story: upon subsequent viewings (and they are legion) I have found that this film is best viewed as though one were watching a Monty Python film. The sensibilities of british humor have clearly infected Peter Jackson here as elsewhere in his portfolio.",1017619200,2,876,4.621794871794871

After I watched BAD TASTE, I didn't think a horror or sci-fi movie could be any more funny until I watched this one. Who could forget such memorable lines as...'Your mother ate my dog' and 'Rich and creamy, just the way I like it'. Hilarious stuff. But my problem with this release is that fact that it is still a cut and trimmed version of DEAD ALIVE. I was able to acquire the X version a few years after the video release and I highly recommend it. And as a bonus, a UK based company released it on DVD. Awesome.

It's far too bloody and repulsive not to be classified as a horror film, but those with an iron constitution will find more laughs here than in all of Pauly Shore's films combined (though that's not saying much, I realize...)
A case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time--in this case, within reach of a crudely-animated Sumatran Rat Monkey--leads to disfigurement, death, and disco zombies.  It would do a disservice to this movie to describe the plot further--there's no way to outline it without it sounding cheesy and hokey.  But part of the reason DEAD ALIVE works is because it knows it's cheesy and hokey (""I kick arse for the LORD!"") and it revels in it.
Director Peter Jackson (currently working on THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) revisited this comic-horror genre with the significantly less gory--and less cheesy--THE FRIGHTENERS.
So if you like your laughs served up with blood-n-gore (and cheese sauce), DEAD ALIVE should appeal.  Sure it's repulsive and often inane--but it's also witty, fast-paced, and a nightmare Freud would be glad he never had.",1015891200,,1169,4.888888888888889

193443,4,157362408X,"Directed by Peter Jackson, the 1992 zombie offering ""Dead Alive"" is arguably one of the most graphically violent films ever made, the latter parts of the movie becoming a hyperkinetic onslaught of dismemberment, disembowelment, ravaged bodily organs, and geysers of spurting blood. If this all sounds too grotesque to bear, the most important thing to know before viewing ""Dead Alive"" is that it's a comedy. Indeed, as repuslive as all this ultra-gory mayhem may sound, the heart of this film is a love story, punctuated by clever visual gags and a sometimes biting sense of irony. As gruesome as its imagery may be, ""Dead Alive"" is, in no way, a disturbing, serious horror movie in the vein of Romero's ""Day of the Dead"". Set in 1950's New Zealand, ""Dead Alive"" begins with a zoological team's capture of a cursed Sumatran rat monkey from Skull Island, then quicky segues to a picturesque town that is the home of Lionel, his domineering harpy of a mother--or ""Mum"" as he calls her--and the sweet young Paquita, who believes Lionel to be her one true love. Into this mix is thrown an assortment of eccentric characters that lends wonderful support to the oddly whimsical story. Once Mum is bitten by the vile rat monkey as she spies on the trysting Lionel and Paquita at the zoo, it's only a matter of time before she is turning into an unspeakably hideous, bloodthirsty zombie, with rotting flesh, a taste for nurses and dogs ... and a bad attitude. Not having the heart to put poor Mum out of her misery, the dutiful Lionel goes about the unenviable task of keeping her and her victims tranquilized in the basement of his and Mum's home, a decision which sets the stage for all hell to break loose. The comical possibilities inherent in this material are rich, and director Jackson wastes little time in exploiting them to their fullest. Once Mum has infected enough of the town's population to keep the bumbling Lionel in a tizzy--as he desperately and hilariously attempts to manage the worsening situation--the stage is set for an over-the-top finale that is as fiendishly audacious as it is riotous. The climactic scene between Lionel and a horribly-mutated Mum is, in itself, worth the price of admission--giving a whole new meaning to the phrase ""a mother's love."" Though not for the overly squeamish--an early scene at the dinner table may forever turn you off from vanilla pudding--""Dead Alive"" has not only buckets of blood ... but buckets of charm.

The Zombie Priest has a thing for the Zombie nurse and they conceive a Zombie Baby. Lionel kind of adopts it and the park scene is enough to make you roll on the floor in tears as you laugh your butt off.

Released in 1992, Dead Alive is one of the most goriest films ever to come out of New Zealand (or anywhere else really!). Taking place in 1957, a rare and dangerous animal, offically known as Simian Raticus (the Rat Monkey Sumatra) is taken from it's home at Skull Island and brought to a local zoo. What the visitors don't know is that this monkey has an infectious bite, one that turns anyone into a bloodthirsty zombie! When Lionel, a young man with a smothering Mother who watches his every move, takes his newly found girlfriend Paquita to that zoo, he gets more than he ever bargined for! You see, while he & Paquita enjoys the zoo, Mother is spying on them, only to accidently get bitten by that monkey (Uh, oh!). After Mother gives the animal the boot (watch & see), Lionel takes her home to get well, but as we all know in these movies, that ain't going to happen! Soon Mother gets ill.......really ill! And the zombie-ness begins! When Zombie-Mom gets loose, she takes a nurse with her, and it ain't to the hospital either! After mom's ""funeral"", she meets a few more of the town locals, including Father McGruder, who appearently ""Kicks (...)For The Lord"", and soon we have quite a little Zombie-party going on here. That is until Lionel's house becomes host to an actual party by his money-hungry Uncle Les. But no one tells the party-goers that the Zombie's are the real guests of honor! So what do you do when you have a party with eventually a hundred or so uninvited zombies? You break out the lawnmower and get to ""weeding"" them out, of course! I think I've told you enough to get your interest in this movie, but if that didn't do it, consider this: I personally own about 75 horror DVD's & Dead Alive is the most goriest, sickest, disturbing, and funniest of my bunch (it's even more of these things than ""Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn""!). The DVD has a nice, crisp picture that's letterboxed, and has a very nice stereo mix too.

If ever topping oneself went out of style, Jackson would be terminally unhip.
Dead Alive features the full circle hero story.  New Zealand actor Timothy Balme does a comendable job as a man who has to do it all from taking care of his horror of a mother, pun intended, you'll see, winning the heart of a young maiden, killing or mowing rather, the bad guys, putting on a tea party and finally, saving the day.
The great thing about this movie is that when your getting grossed out, you're laughing, usually out loud.  I can't remember the last time an homage was paid to the legendary kung fu films of Hong Kong, and George Romero at the same time, and was pulled off this gracefully. Suffice it to say, You will always wonder if men of the cloth know martial arts once this particular scene is over.
Did I mention that there is a zombie baby running wild at a playground too?  If you aren't at all interested, then hopefully the only reason you wouldn't watch Dead Alive was because this is one of the worst reviews you have ever read, and not because you haven't, in the least bit, had your interest piqued in the slightest.

If you are a true horror buff, then this movie is a must for your collection. Not only does this movie have cool special effects, it is just plain awsome. There is no doubt that it is the goriest movie ever made and it actually has some what of a plot too. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Buy this movie today!",1007078400,,495,3.96
193477,5,157362408X,"When I first rented ""Dead Alive,"" I got it from a Blockbuster store.  A critic on the front of the box was quoted as saying ""This is the goriest and funniest film I've ever seen!""  I watched the movie, and wondered how anyone could have found the film ""gory"" OR ""funny.""  To me, it just didn't make sense, and it seemed just plain stupid and boring. Of course, what I didn't know then was that the movie had been cut, and almost 10 minutes of additional gore was missing.  If you think about that, that's a LOT of gore (a death scene takes what, 5 seconds?).  SO, since I couldn't find the unrated version anywhere, I ordered it and watched it last night.  NOW I see what the critic was talking about.  Ironically, by taking out all the gore, Blockbuster simply made the movie more disturbing and strange.  WITH all the gore, it's nothing short of hysterical.  Here's a small comparison between the R and unrated versions:
1)  right away, the first man to be bitten is practically mutilated in the unrated version.  He right hand and left arm are seen chopped off.  In the R version, neither scene is shown, just him screaming.
2) the ""lunch"" scene is MUCH funnier in the unrated version.  Lionel's mother squirts blood into the guests pudding.  We watch him eat the pudding.  Then her ear falls off into her own pudding, and she eats that, too, sending another guest running to the bathroom.  In the R version, we have to imply that she has squirted blood into the pudding, and the ear never falls off (which makes for much confusion later when it's quite apparently missing).
3) when the nurse comes to check on Lionel's mother in the unrated version, the zombie grabs her face.  Mother's fingers meld into the nurse's face, and eventually put it backward at a 90 degree angle.  This makes for some hysterically disturbing scenes later where she just can't seem to keep her head on straight.  In the R version, we see the Mother pop up behind the nurse, but see nothing of the gore.  By cutting that violence, though, any future reference to the nurse's head problem is therefore not funny--just confusing.
4) The Party at the end:  Where to start?  In the R version I saw, the party is a totally confusing, strange, and illogical event.  Zombies suddenly pop to life, people run, people fall, and then suddenly Lionel shows up with a lawnmower and everyone dies.  In the UNRATED version, I watched in horror and amusement at some of the most grisly, but way over-the-top death scenes I've ever seen.  People are beheaded, disembowled, and mutilated.  One man's ribs are pulled out while he watches.  Another woman is punched so hard from behind that the hand comes through the back of her head and out of her mouth.  It's powerful stuff--but much funnier when shown.
Bottom line:  UNRATED VERSION:  5 stars  R Version:  1 star  Stay away from the Rated R version!",1005091200,18,2866,4.589743589743589

This extremely graphic blood fest features some of the most originally grotesque and sick sequences ever, including TONS of spraying blood and flying body parts, a world record amount of dismemberment, disembowelment, multiple decapitations, teeth pulling, a rib cage getting torn out from a body, a zombie's head getting cut off--- kicked around on the floor and then liquified in a blender, a zombie in a meat grinder, a rake thrust into the back of a skull, a lawnmower chopping through a room full of zombies (AWESOME, goriest scene of all time), a monkey's head that gets squashed, tons of internal organs, body parts, puss, goo, slime, and blood spilling everywhere, a zombie's head engulfed in flames, a woman eating a dog, the skin of a head being peeled away from the flesh, a fist going through a head and coming out through the mouth, a zombie cut in half (the upper torso half ends up in the toilet and the legs keep walking on their own), a disgusting animated pile of guts, excessive dead bodies, a heaping pile of severed body parts, rotting zombies, a mutated killer baby, a head attached to spine being whipped around-then the head is smashed like a can of tomato juice, pieces of a woman's head and face falling off, flesh eating, intestines used in every possible way imaginable, outrageous embalming scene (fluids squirt out of the body like a geyser), head explodes like a grape, zombie sex, slashing, hacking, chopping, you get the idea.

No possible way to remember everything. You will never look at pudding the same way again. That's only a small sample of the insanity. This is a gore hound's dream come true, I guarantee it will be well beyond anything you have ever imagined. The cool thing is, 90% of the gore is within the last 20 minutes! The grand finale is so over the top and fast paced, there's no way to put it to words. Let me just say you will have to pick your jaw up off the floor. Top notch effects from Mr. Jackson. This movie makes the gore and violence in nearly every other film look like Little Red Riding Hood. The uncut version (called Braindead) runs an extra 8 minutes and has even more shocking gore.
If you like Dead Alive, check out: Bad Taste (from the same director, also full of gore), Return of the Living Dead, Pieces, the Beyond, Re-Animator, Redneck Zombies, and Jason Goes to Hell: the Final Friday, tons of gore in these movies as well. 5 stars for Dead Alive, a must see.",1004400000,7,2683,4.622641509433962

Yes, it is probably the goriest movie ever made, but it's use of blood and violence is so completely over the top, it crosses into the realm of hilarious by fifty Sumarian rat monkeys' heads.
I generally try to avoid overly gorey movies myself (I'm not particularly sensitive or anything, it's just that 99.9% of 'em [... stink]), but ""Dead Alive"" sort of goes beyond that. If monsters in the basement, kung-fu priests, zombie-babies and alternative uses of lawnmowers seem like your kind of thing, you could do far worse than watching this.
On the other hand, those of you looking for high drama and a thought-provoking plot would be best adviced to search elsewhere. The original title, ""Braindead"", is a bit more appropriate I think.
Speaking of original, the American unrated version on sale here is not uncut. My copy, subtiteled ""Red Edition"" (wich speaks for itself, I guess) runs about 10 minutes longer than this version. Probably nothing vital to the plot, but you gore-hounds out there might want to check it out.

Gore and Zombie films really interest me and I have seen all the classics. The version of this film I got a hold of over here was titled Braindead and had a running time of 100 minutes. Pal runs at 25fps while ntsc is 24fps so therefore ntsc versions matered from pal are around 4% long, so a true uncut ntsc version runs 104-105minutes.
I won't waste any time explaining the story and can not argue the reputation of this picture as the goriest film of all time, it features more graphic violence than anything else I have ever seen. The gore though is not intended to scare but succeeds excellently in its goal to surprise and entertain the viewer.
There are plenty of reviews for this picture and I won't repeat what they have to say, but have a few points that they miss. Australian viewers will probually see the NewZealand quirks of the characters and find more humor in them than an American viewer. Also I can't understand the fools writting reviews claiming the acting is awfull. I thought it was great. Timthy Balme is unbelievable with a great mothers boy persona and constant freaked out desparation. And Diana Penalver, what a performance. Amazing and flawless! Her acting was stunning in the sheer believability and charm she brings to her character. Every single movment, expression and word of hers has a genuine feel that you rarely if ever see in movies.
Well I'm sure that the acting isn't the reason why you are going to see this movie. And I hope you will see this film. There are many reasons why I recoment this movie, all the gore is there and its spectacular, it has great moments of pure humor, easily the best horror comedy and a damn great zombie film, also its refreshingly different approach to the genere.

Jackson brings us some of the most brilliant bloodiest  sequences ever, not by using digital FX, but by fantastic make-up and  seamless editing...Just try to find a flaw!

She manages to  escape the cellar Lionel locked her in and infects some more vistims whom  poor Lionel soon has to look after. The zombie problem comes to its climax  when the weirdos bite the guests of a party in Lionel's house - and this  problem seems only solvable by shredding all monsters into pieces with a  flymo...

Informed by every over-the-top horror film from Repulsion to Return of the Living Dead, filled with more Freudianism than a box of Cuban  cigars, with more gore than any three Herschel Gordon Lewis movies  combined, Dead Alive makes you wonder whether what's bubbling up from the  pit of your stomach is laughter or bile way too many times.

Paquita  (Diana Penalver) is convinced that she and twittish Lionel (Timothy Balme)  are made for each other, thanks to her mother's fotunetelling (nice Crowley  deck there, I might add). She ropes Lionel into taking her to the zoo, and  the two are followed and spied on by Lionel's domineering mother (Elizabeth  Moody, doing her finest Joan Crawford impersonation). In the act of spying,  Mum is bitten by the Giant Sumatran Rat Monkey, whose bite turns the victim  into a zombie capable of animating other zombies and... well, you get the  idea. In perfect comedy/horror tradition, the only way to kill the zombies  is really, really bloody.

Much of the atmosphere of this film is lent  by the fact that everyone there isn't taking it all that seriously, and it  shows; this is the same thing that lends strength to Return of the Living  Dead and Sam Raimi's Evil Dead films. As long as everyone behind the TV  screen is having fun, you might as well too.

Not even the part where the mother eat's the dog comes across  as being sad or cruel. You'll just have to see it to believe it. I think  the ending lawnmower seen took about 5,000 gallons of fake blood.

Dead-Alive is a definite classic in my book. If you want to be scared,sorry! Not much suspense here. But if you want gore galore and one of the most gruesome imagery you'll ever see,THIS  IS IT! Now Dead-Alive has hardly any scares. It's overpowered  by non-stop  humor. A biker urinates on a lady's grave,a fat guy gets kicked in the balls  by a  zombified baby and a ninja-fighting priest jump kicks zombies  yelling out loud ""I kick arse for the lord!"" This movie is  basically a comedy. But the gore is so high you'll wonder why it wasn't  rated triple X.And that is NO joke. This makes other horror flicks like Evil  Dead,Friday The 13th,Halloween and others look like PBS programs! Necks  ripped open,rib-cage ripped from body, multiple zombies mowed down by a  lawnmower (arguably the goriest scene) and many more make  this one of the  grossest movies ever (if not THE grossest).The special F/X are  brilliant. There so great I can't even explain. There too good to  describe. The story is pretty good and the acting is above-average (Tim  Balme is a really good actor who deserves more credit than he's gotten).  The script isn't bad. It's fairly unpredictable. Overall,Dead-Alive is a  brilliant horror movie that you HAVE to get. Just make sure you get the  unrated version. Avoid the R-version like a flesh-eating zombie. Unrated,but  contains extreme violence and gore galore and some language.",960854400,10,1439,4.916666666666667
193548,3,157362408X,"Inspired by the couragous cult-classic Evil Dead series, Dead Alive, besides obsene amounts of blood and gore, really doesn't have much to  offer.  There's a lot of cheap effects and campy horror that every movie  fan craves, but the odd humor really doesn't fit in very well.  I've seen  the movie several times, and it keeps getting worse and worse.  Dead Alive  definately has its good points, such as the kung-fu priest, the zombie  baby, the walking intestines, and the giant monster that literally has a  man-eating stomach.  These are all awsome ideas and I praise Peter Jackson  for his creativity, but if you're going to make a humourous horror movie,  leave out some of the odd gorry details.  The cheap soundtrack and  disjointed photography made the charactors and their surroundings deluded,  not in the least bit humorous.  Therefore, this movie is not a comedy, nor  is it part of the horror gendre, but merely an odd film.  I almost felt  disturbed while watching this movie, mainly because I didn't want to take  the movie very seriously.  You can't laugh with a movie like Dead Alive,  you're more likely to laugh at it.  And this is fine if the movie were  uncontrollably rediculous, but there was too much distasteful gore, and not  enough charactor development.  I didn't have a sense of pride in the hero  because he was such a loser, and the dillusional gypsy that he fell in love  with was just not believable enough.  The hero was a secluded  ""mother's boy"" who only had a girlfriend because of some  coincidence due to his stupidity.  What kind of a hero is that?  The  monsters were the only enjoyable characters in the movie, especially the  baby.  Leave out the heartless dialogue and screwy acting, then you've got  a classic.  Otherwise, its an amateur horror movie that no one can possibly  relate to.  I give this movie credit because of its odd originality and  definate creativity.  Otherwise, this is not a movie I would look forword  to seeing again.  Buy it for the gore, not the laughs.",960768000,,2025,4.728323699421965

I've seen quite a lot of these gore movies that have invaded  the screens since the seventies but I often felt uneasy watching the  efforts of this new generation of scalpel directors. It was surgery on the  screen to me, not cinema. I wasn't afraid but disgusted. On the contrary,  DEAD ALIVE makes me laugh. Why ? Because it's a B degree movie. Peter  Jackson knows that his audience has seen quite a lot of these horror movies  and he plays with us.
Furthermore, Peter Jackson has a terrific sense of  humor. So, even if you're not fond of living dead movies, I'm sure you will  pass a great moment with the possessive mother of the DEAD ALIVE hero and  her hilarious companions. Just don't forget your umbrella.

Dead Alive is an unbeleviable  spectacle of wickedly over-the-top special effects and Peter Jackson's very  dark sense of humor. This 1993 Austrailian film, begins as hilarious spoof  of Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark and then turns into one heck of  homage to Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Sam Raimi's Evil Dead. Once  poor Lionel's mother is bitten by a very rare and ferocious rat monkey, she  turns into a very one-track minded zombie, and the maddness just gets worse  from there. Expect to be impressed by overflowing body parts, squirting  ligaments, a holy warrior kicking a## for the lord, zombie sex, zombie  babies, blended zombie heads, and one weird Oedipal relationship gone  terriably terriably wrong. A must-see for any horror fan with strong  stomachs. Dead Alive is unsurpassed in film disgust.

I had never seen anything quite so disgusting in my life...and believe me I've seen 'em all, such as the Dario Argento, George Romero, Jon Waters, John Carpenter, ""Faces  of Death"", films.  I love horror; the scarier and grosser, the better.  Current Favorites:  Scream 1&2, Ravenous (great! and gory!), All  ""Evil Deads""
But do you know what I hate?  That once directors  make a name for themselves in the horror genre, they tend to go to  mainstream filmmaking.  Like Peter Jackson...,now, I loved ""Heavenly  Creatures"", but I miss the blood and guts.  That's what happened to  Sam Raimi (Evil Dead), Brian De Palma (Carrie, Dressed to Kill).  Even  authors are toning down, witness Clive Barker.  His ""Books of  Blood"" were the best things ever and he doesn't do them anymore.  Please, maybe Quentin Tarantino can save us?",923443200,,869,4.916666666666667
193607,5,157362408X,"Makes ""Evil Dead"" series childs play for gore impact. So much blood- too few zombies. A classic cult film for you horror fans. Good story line and plot for a film made in New Zealand. Production company is named  ""Wingnut productions"" and by their name does this film justice.

193609,5,157362408X,"Braindead (Dead Alive's original title) is the best Gore-film you will ever see! It is breathtakingly hilarious, horribly bloody, absolutely inventive - and probably the only splatter movie you can watch with your  girlfriend...well...almost! It even beats Jackson's own Bad Taste in gore,  fun and style. A must-see!!",914284800,,318,5.604166666666667
