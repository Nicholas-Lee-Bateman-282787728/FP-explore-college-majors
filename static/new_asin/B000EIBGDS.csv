This is a great romantic comedy. Uday Chopra is as great as always. The story is easy to follow and also easy to root on.

The one let down in the film is the make up. They worked overly hard to create a youthful look to the no-longer-high-school-aged  Uday Chopra. His lips are oddly pink most of the movie. Other than that his acting is top-notch.

This film pokes fun at Bollywood conventions while executing a fine film.",1520812800,,488,4.329670329670329

8110453,4,B000EIBGDS,"I saw this movie before I bought my copy. I liked it; I really wanted to love it but the story line is...well: slutty, trampy, vulgar in nature at times. Yet, it had some really, really cute scenes and some really great songs, which I kept finding myself watching on youtube. Then, I became a fan of Uday Chopra and bought some of his other movies, like Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai and Mohabbatein, which lead me back to Neal and Nikki and buying my own copy of it.",1326758400,,461,4.191011235955056
8110454,2,B000EIBGDS,"Here we have a Yash Raj film.  The ever gorgeous Tanisha Mukerjee, and a time span of less than two hours, but yet this film was just plain stupid!

Tanisha Mukerjee is gorgeous.  I'd almost tolerate any Bollywood film that would have her, and I put alot of confidence in Yash Raj to put out a great film, but I was really let down with this film.

I appreciate that it wasn't some long, tiring, three hour movie but even at just under two hours, there still was way too much music which usually kills the appeal of any Bollywood film to most Americans (including American born Indians).

I won't watch this one again anytime soon.",1293235200,,631,4.405172413793103
