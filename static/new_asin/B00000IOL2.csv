7911222,1,B00000IOL2,"Were I able to give 1.5 stars, I would, as 1 star is, perhaps, a little unfair, but it isn't really worth 2 stars.

A little background: I was in Switzerland over the summer and visited the Fliegerflab Museum at Dubendorf, which has sparked an interest in the SAF. So I thought this would be a nice little reminder, and at only $8 including postage, I thought it was a good price.

First things first - this is a 1999 boxing of a 1991 airshow, so don't expect bang up to date - the F/A-18 is shown in Canadian markings, as it hadn't entered SAF service at that time. Still, there are some rare flying birds here, including the Dewoitine D.26 parasol fighter and C.36 target tug - though all too little is seen of both.

This video has a couple of good points  - first, there is some good videography in here. They employed two cameramen, so there are some different angles, though their shooting has not always been used to good effect. Second, there's no annoying commentary, and no ultra-annoying rock music playing in the background - just aircraft noise, and some classical music in the first and last sequence.

That's as good as it gets.

On the minus side - first, the box claims 55 minutes - it doesn't even last 30!!  Second, there are 30 different aircraft sequences - that's less than a minute each! There's no time to appreciate any one aircraft - had it truly been 55 minutes, this would have been a better video. Third - and perhaps most important -  the editing is terrible; sharp cuts all the time (NO soft transitions) , many done during the middle of a pass, each shot only lasts a few seconds. It's very abrupt, distracting and disorienting, as your mind constantly adjusts to a new shot.

As I say, there are some nice pieces here - the Mirage III JATO take-off, the Patrouille Suisse Hunters, and I love the Dewoitine D.26 - but each sequence is too short, and the JATO take off is ruined by constant camera changes. It feels as if this is a sample video for something much longer, each shot and sequence being far too short. Not recommended.

Unfortunately, this could have been so much better, but really falls short.",1385164800,,2140,4.4781491002570695
