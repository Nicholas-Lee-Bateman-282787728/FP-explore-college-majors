8711403,5,B00VVWJ7L4,"This Blu-Ray is a huge collection of over four and a half hours of CGR reviews, skits, and Lord Karnage.
There are over 50 reviews which every element of CGRs history; some of the reviews are even exclusive to this production. The reviews range from the early days of CGR back in 1999-2000 to the more modern reviews of today. There is usually a little intro on most of the reviews from the mastermind/super genius of CGR, Mark Bussler, AKA Lord Karnage.  Lord Karnage gives some details on the reviews in their intros, and the whole presentation never slows down.
Another way Mark breaks up the reviews is in between some of the reviews, he includes footage of an interview conducted exclusively for this Blu-Ray/DVD with CGR co-founder/game reviewing pioneer David Crosson. The pair talks about their days in the early years of CGR when they worked from fromUSAlive.com as well as some of their fondest memories and reviews. Many of these moments and reviews can be found on the 2007 Rise and Fall of Classic Game Room DVD produced by Mark Bussler, which details the roller-coaster adventures of Mark and David during the first two years of CGR in 1999-2000.

Consoles from the Atari 2600 to the Wii U are featured in the presentation, as well some as reviews on arcade games, toys, food, and even a Ferrari. While it is sad that Mark is easing up on CGR, there is no better way for fans to celebrate the greatness of CGR, then to get a cold drink, pop in this production, and enjoy the ride. There is even an alternate commentary for the DVD/Blu-Ray where Mark goes into further detail on what it took to create this wonderful collection of hilarious reviews and general awesomeness.  If you are a CGR fan, then you should get this collection no question.  With this Blu-Ray, and the 2007 DVD, you will have hours upon hours of quality, funny, insightful, and unforgettable entertainment.",1447804800,6,1891,4.7039274924471295
