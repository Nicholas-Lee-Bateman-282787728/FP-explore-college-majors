8007400,3,B00016XNO8,"A famous vampire actor turns out to be an actual vampire in this dimly lit film that's usually dark and dreary. A lot of the film takes place indoors, at this dreary old movie theater. There's no nudity, it doesn't have much action overall, and the entire thing feels kind of lifeless. There's gore in parts, but none of it is extreme. I thought the directing was decent, but the problem is that it doesn't deliver any noteworthy suspense, the scenery isn't worth mentioning, and it doesn't succeed much in atmosphere or exploitation either. The film presents a dim and dark atmospheric quality throughout most of the film that I personally thought wasn't very effective. This dreariness is combined with an overall lack of things like action, exploitation, and good scenery; this usually makes the film feel lifeless. Some may be bored by some of the dialogue, as well as some of the dimly lit indoor sequences. It gets a little slow at times, and I wouldn't exactly label it as a tame film because of some scenes; but it isn't very explicit and contains no extreme exploitation. Despite these problems, it has a nice 70s feel. Some of the dialogue parts, like when the vampire is condemning the theories on how movie violence causes real violence, are good. It does get involving in some parts, but it's best to watch it on YOUTUBE first before you buy it. I'd give it about three and a half stars.

I personally didn't care that much for the extras. The Bad Seed sequence runs a little over a minute. This just has a little girl walk into a room with some dead people lying there, and you hear her voice narrating the sequence about her killing them. The Leonard Maltin and Richard Jewell interview may be of interest to some, but they aren't too long and run under 10 minutes. That Revenge of the Tiger extra is some phony karate instructor sequence that runs about 5 minutes. He just demonstrates his moves with his students. The photo gallery is nothing special and only runs about a minute. There's also a commentary for the film. The DVD quality is very good. The menu and chapter stops have no animation and are nothing fancy. This disc may be OOP, so you may want to check it out on YOUTUBE. If you really like it, it may be a good idea to get it before the price goes up.",1400803200,,2282,4.51207729468599
8007401,5,B00016XNO8,"I took a chance on purchasing this title, and I'm glad I did! Based on the movie description and reviews, you would think that this movie was just some poorly scripted, acted, and produced indie project of film students; but, it actually deserves to be remembered a existential cult favorite in the same genre as Jean Rollin's Two Orphan Vampires, Nude Vampire, or Fiance of Dracula, or Jess Fanco's vampire-werewolf-frankenstein movies. Nightmare in Blood is that good, if you are into adult horror fantasy! By the end of the dvd, you will wind up regarding this movie as a serious statement and morality play on the evil extant in the world, anti-censorship, and appeal for the freedom of the imagination.

There is a defining scene in the movie, quite memorable, in which Malaki, the vampire, justifies his existence to the film critic by explaining that evil existed in the world long before the horror novel and comic book, and the characters in them; this evil is recorded in human history, made real by real people, and is as old as humanity itself. Its the point at which this movie not only congeals into a bonafide horror film, but becomes shakespearian through Malaki's monologue!

The end of the movie is as effective as Malaki's monolgue, with the professor who organized the horror convention delivering a bomb of warning to a audience of kids masked as their favorite movie characters: there is no line between reality and make-believe. To paraphrase, monsters are real, and they walk among us. The moral being that it pays to believe, believing may save you someday!

This movie is a lively and wonderful mix of comic relief and dramatic play, as well as a welcome romance with the the 70s, and cinema in general. Thouroughly entertaining is the character of the comic book store owner, a seeming comic version of Jesus or John the Baptist, that presages the deaf quadrapelegic psuedo-prophet in John Gulager's Feast III - but with a Polanskiesque tailoring! Nightmare in Blood is a gem, and you will be pleased to add this one to your dvd library.",1244505600,,2064,4.824858757062147
8007402,2,B00016XNO8,"If you've ever wondered what a horror movie made by a fan boy would look like, you need go no further than John Stanley's ""Nightmare in Blood."" Films made by diehard fans of the genre aren't entirely rare by any means. I suspect that every other cheap, straight to video slasher flick coming out today has a fan boy behind the camera. I know for a fact that the Z grade, micro budget, shot on video dreck distributed by companies like Sub Rosa definitely owe much to guys who grew up under the influence of horror films. It's not surprising fans eventually get behind the camera. After you've watched as many of these cheesy films as I have, you quickly start to think, ""I can do better than that,"" or something similar. But as anyone familiar with fan made horror films can attest, it isn't quite so easy to make any film let alone a horror film. Not only do you have to worry about film, cameras, actors, set pieces, and all the other minutiae central to the production process, you also have to worry about special effects. If you're going to make a horror movie, you MUST have special effects. It's a federal law, I think.

Well, ""Nightmare in Blood"" contains plenty of special effects work, some that work quite well considering the budget, but the film fails in nearly every other aspect except standing out as probably the most blatant fan boy production ever. Made in San Francisco during the early 1970s but not released until the end of the decade, ""Nightmare in Blood"" tells the story of a series of most unusual incidents unfolding against the backdrop of a horror convention. Successful author and horror fan Professor Seabrook (Dan Caldwell), a Sherlock Holmes aficionado named Scotty (John Cochran), and a convention organizer called Cindy (Barrie Youngfellow) express great excitement about bringing a horror convention to town, and they express even more enthusiasm over getting a big star to show up for the fans. This celebrity is Malakai (Jerry Walter), a man who has made numerous vampire films in the past few years. We even see a clip of Malakai's latest film, involving his vampire character battling the guy who played Sinbad years ago, at the beginning of ""Nightmare in Blood."" Problems soon emerge when our heroes discover that Malakai is an odd duck. He insists on staying in character at all times, meaning that he sleeps in a coffin and only roams around at night. Hmmm.

Even worse, Malakai brings with him two creepy individuals, Harris (Hy Pike) and B.B. (Ray K. Gorman), explaining that they are his ""publicists."" Yeah, right. To make a long, long story short, people start perishing under mysterious circumstances soon after Malakai arrives on the scene. Yep, you guessed it: Malakai is actually a living (no pun intended), breathing vampire. And his publicists? Turns out both men are actually the notorious nineteenth century ghouls Burke and Hare, kept alive through frequent infusions of some weird elixir invented by the crazed Malakai. These three evil souls put pictures of potential victims on the wall and then choose who is next by throwing sharp objects at them in some bizarro version of darts. When an obnoxious film critic shows up at a panel discussion to blast Malakai's films as cheap dreck, he goes in a particular unpleasant way. The same thing happens to another chap whose only indiscretion consists of supporting horror movie censorship (I thought that's what we had ratings for, even in the 1970s.). Others give up the ghost in rapid succession until Ben Halik (Mark Anger) walks on stage. He's been hunting Malakai since World War II, and he convinces our heroes to join in the fight. Toss in the kooky owner of a comic book store, Gary (Drew Eshelman), as another aide in the fight against Malakai, and the game is afoot.

I never knew this film existed until I stumbled over it on a rental expedition and thought I would give it a shot. I generally try to avoid vampire films, something I seem to be less and less successful at in the last few months. After watching this extraordinarily cheap film, I can't really recommend it. I did like a few things in ""Nightmare in Blood,"" including the hilariously deadpan Gary character and the even more hilarious scene showing Malakai's cheesy laboratory, but everything else is strictly low budget humdrum. The acting ability of nearly every character in the film is laughable, the picture moves slower than a snail caught in a pool of molasses, and the dialogue will melt your eardrums. Moreover, the lighting is so uniformly poor that you'll spend most of the film squinting at the screen trying to make out what is going on. I also discovered quite early on that the blatant fan boy mentality on display everywhere hindered the viewing experience. Yeah, I complain about things like the heavy-handed censorship of horror pictures too, but that doesn't mean I want to hear about it every five minutes in a movie. Maybe this issue was more relevant in the 1970s when truly disturbing films were coming out every other day, but now it seems out of place in an age when you just wait for a company to release the uncut version on DVD.

Speaking of DVD versions, the ""Nightmare in Blood"" disc receives a surprisingly good treatment. Extras include a commentary track with director John Stanley and writer Kenn Davis, stills, and several clips from Stanley's San Francisco ""Creature Feature"" television program. In two segments, he interviews Leonard Maltin and an author who wrote a book about the heyday of RKO studios. Two additional clips feature a lame martial arts demonstration (!) and a cheesy skit called ""Bad Seed."" Even fans of schlock cinema will have a tough time with ""Nightmare in Blood.""",1103328000,,5704,4.811416921508664
8007403,2,B00016XNO8,"What a terrible movie!  It is funny that the film was about a convention in San Francisco when the movie was actually shot in Downtown Oakland at the Fox Oakland Theatre before the theatre was ravaged by a fire and the seats were torn out.  Here it is 30 years later, the Fox Oakland is still there and vacant, (not gone as stated by another writer)and so is this movie! As a native from Oakland, and a projectionist for many years, the scene of the Avenue Theatre just brought back so many memories.  Warren Lubich on the organ!  It is now a church.
I was an employee of the Fox Oakland.  During the narration of the movie, it was stated that it felt like there was a spirit of somekind there.  There is.  Wierd, wierd, things used to happen in there.  On each side of the stage there were two buddahs, holding pots.  Dry ice would be dropped in it and it would explode with smoke.  The right buddah used to light up all by itself and it had eyes that looked like it followed you everywhere.  The left buddah would spout smoke when the mechanical device that ran it wasn't even connected. Pictures of the buddahs are at [...] The curtains on the stage would close and reopen by itself.  One time when the movie started and the curtains started to open, the screen started to move upward and eventually the movie was showing on the bare wall!  The projectionist tried to stop it but couldn't cause there was no switch!.  In the row of seats in front of the projection booth in the balcony, when you looked up you would see a old lady sitting there all by herself, she would look at you and smile and slowly disappear.  Frances, the evening usher, saw her when the Fox was closing for the evening,  she fainted.  She quit the next day.  When the Fox Oakland was ravaged by not one but two fires, the seats were removed.  There was a pleasure faire there and several employees saw the old lady in the projection booth, scared the heck out of a lot of people.  The Fox Oakland is under renovation - and is haunted, no doubt.
The producers of this film picked a perfect place.
When I first saw the film, it played at the York Theatre in San Francisco.  A quarter of the people walked out.  Sad, but true!",1081728000,4,2200,4.314634146341463
8007404,3,B00016XNO8,"""Nightmare in Blood"" has a lot going for it but is hampered by a very low budget, amateurish production values and a very dark DVD print. It concerns a ""Horrorcon""---horror film convention---in San Francisco where the guest of honor, vampire star Malakai, turns out to be the real thing. He's accompanied by the rejuvenated corpse snatchers Burke and Hare. They start conducting their rejuvination experiments in the basement of the theater where the convention is being held. Victims soon start being dissected and organs stolen. A Jewish vampire hunter is hot on Malakai's trail because Malakai was a disciple of Hitler! But the intrepid cast band together with the hunter to stop the carnage. And there is carnage. There's violence and gore and some of it appears to have been trimmed because there's a choppiness to it that gets annoying. Cast features Barrie Youngfellow (of the 70's sitcom ""It's a Living"") as Cindy and Kathleen Quinlan (billed as ""Kathy"") can be seen screaming in a brief scene. The film has lots of references to old horror films as well as clips and posters used as props. Much discussion about horror films' effects on society and children is used throughout as well. Overall, ""Nightmare in Blood"" is an odd, drive-in style film that suffers from some problems. The acting ranges from good to downright bad and I wish the print wasn't so dark. But some may like it and if you're curious it's worth a look. It has some interesting, if not entirely successful, points.",1077062400,2,1493,4.881889763779528
