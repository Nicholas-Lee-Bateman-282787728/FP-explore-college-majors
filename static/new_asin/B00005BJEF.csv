Why have commercial breaks? The extra DVD could have had some other features (widescreen, web site, etc.)I would recommend it to other Robotech fans.",992908800,,306,4.62962962962963
1424375,4,B00005BJEF,"There are a few people who have reviewed this collection badly because there is going to be a release of Macross soon.  Robotech is not Macross.  Given, this portion of Robotech uses the Macross animation, but the story is significantly different.  If you loved Robotech as a kid, this is what you want.  You might also enjoy Macross, but if you wait and get Macross expecting it to be what was on after school, then you'll be sorely disappointed.",992217600,10,447,4.620253164556962
1424376,5,B00005BJEF,"This is the greatest epic animated series ever created for american TV. The original creators of Robotech had a greater vision then the diparate japanese series it was derived from. Make no mistake, I don't call this Anime because it doesn't compare well to the Anime greats like Akira in anything other than the animation. This is a uniquely american story line, the characters are american, the animation is japanese. If you're a fan of the originals: Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada, then skip this. But if you want to see a great epic american animated series there is none better than Robotech.",992217600,4,604,4.87378640776699
1424377,5,B00005BJEF,"ALthough some regions of the United States remember Force Five, Battle of the Planets, and Star Blazers, Robotech was the true groundbreaking series that introduced most US people to anime. Adapted from the original Macross series in Japan, Robotech is an intense space opera about an alien ship that crash lands on earth and the changes it brings with it. Containing the science of robo-technology, powered by the mysterious force known as protoculture, the alien race Zentradi come looking for the ship and all it contains. Meanwhile Earth has learned to adapt the wondrous technology and all nations have come together as a single government concerned with alien invasion. The ship has  been adapted into the SDF-1 and on its maiden flight the Zentradi attack. In an attempt to escape destruction the SDF-1 attempts a ""space fold"" warping itself and the surrounding Macross Island into space. The survivors are brought on board SDF-1, and young Rick Hunter, circus pilot finds himself joining the military to help defend the Earth those he loves. The SDF-1 travels through space chased by the alien aggressors and all they want is to return home. It is an intense series with transforming mecha, young love set against the backdrop of all out war in space.",992044800,3,1259,4.995238095238095
1424378,5,B00005BJEF,"The ""Macross Saga boxed set vol. 1 DVD"" is more than just one DVD. It contains 3 DVDs, with the first 12 episodes, and an extra disc with nothing but bonus material on it. The ""vol. 1"" in the title is kinda confusing I guess. Anyway, if you don't want the extra disc you can just buy the episode DVDs separate ..., and for 6 episodes a disc, that's pretty darn cheap. The extra material on the bonus disc includes a different edit for the first episode, commentary by Carl Macek(writer, producer), clips of Robotech in different languages, and sketch art. Nothing major, but die hard Robotech fans will wanna pick it up.",991785600,2,620,4.495575221238938

Now they're out on DVD, so what are you people waiting for? We may never see something like this again. Robotech/ Macross is to me and many other 'genuine' Anime lovers as say, George Lucas is to his Star Wars series.

1424380,5,B00005BJEF,"The definitive anime series for me growing was Robotech. Everyday, I would be glued to the TV for that one half hour where all sorts of action and drama unfolded before my eyes. Now, that I'm older and hopefully wiser, the Robotech series still holds a magic and amazement for me that is timeless. The series is great from beginning to end. It's about time that the series is released in it's entirety on DVD. The only drawback appears to be that in the first installment, you're only getting one third of the Macross Saga. I think that each series should be released altogether. Money seems to be a factor here - but I will buy them all nonetheless after having owned VCD copies of these shows for years.",991008000,,705,4.4728682170542635

1424382,1,B00005BJEF,"Robotech is the classic English translation of three Japanese cartoon series Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada.  To say that the Robotech Saga was great does it no justice.  Robotech is extraordinary.  One of the first animes to make the jump from Japan to the US, Robotech brought animation to a whole new level in the US.
This isn't a cartoon with 30-minute essentially non-related episodes.  The Robotech Saga melds 3 different Japanese cartoons into one storyline.  Although I am not the biggest fan of Southern Cross or the 3rd Generation, the First generation, which encompasses the first 36 Episodes of Robotech is simply stellar.  The storyline is robust, characters are amazingly developed, and the action is amazing.  The animation may be a bit plain, but considering that Macross was first drawn 20 years ago, I would argue that it has withstood time quite well.
Although Robotech is a must-own for any fan of anime, DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!  ADV is coming out with a remastered version of Robotech on DVD which will include digitally remastered video and sound.  I unfortunately bought this set well before the announcement of the new set and was somewhat disappointed with the video and sound quality of these DVDs.  In addition, most of the Bonus DVDs in these sets contain useless items, except for E3, which contains the Sentinels episodes.",988588800,2,1358,4.969026548672566
1424383,5,B00005BJEF,"Anybody that watched this as a kid, discovered it recently, or is just discovering it now, Will absolutely love this DVD. It is an exciting adventure that helped bring Anime to America. The story and animation is simply stunning. We have been waiting for this for quite a long time. The boxed set will be coming with 3 DVDs. The first 2 will have 6 episodes a piece giving you a third of the Macross Saga. The third one will be Codename:Robotech. A 90 min. special that helped introduced Robotech to us. If you are a huge fan and would like a lot more about Robotech, then just check out Robotech.com. It has quite a lot about the show as well as a fabulous forum with a lot of friendly people. Have fun with this, the first of quite a few DVDs about Robotech to come. Happy viewing.

1424384,5,B00005BJEF,"This is a great series with lots of emotional rollercoasters, love triangles and action. I never saw the american version, but the Japanese version called Macross was awesome, basically the same thing with english subs. The Mech designs still remain the standard for most mecha anime. I used to collect action figures and I have 3 transforming Valkeries, they look exactly like they do in the cartoon its amazing. This series is a true classic in the way that Gundam is. If you enjoyed this series, I reccomend Gundam Zeta, its verry similar, but its verry dark and tragic, which naturally makes it way better.",1030838400,,610,4.819047619047619

1424386,4,B00005BJEF,"What can I say?  Great series, great action sequences and character development.  I just recently started watching the series for the first time and after the first episode I was already hooked.  I loved the whole series except for the robotek masters saga.
I was really impressed on character development and how they could tell you a lot about characters and their past lives and not bore the crud out of you.  Moving storyline and fun scenes will make you cheer on Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes and Minmay in their romantic, action packed, hilarious adventure.",1026777600,,557,4.831578947368421
1424387,2,B00005BJEF,I haven't bought the set on dvd but i did rent it. Marcoss is one of my all time favorite shows. The only flaws I can see in this first dvd set( and probably the rest of the sets) is that carl macek and the people at adv did not take the time to fix degradation in the video quality(it looks like they dubbed this from vid tapes)and the high price. This series is also available from Animego in dubbed form with the original dialog(not carls) and the video quality is far superior( they went to japan for the original negatives) after video enhancing to restore it.,1025827200,,565,4.289719626168225
1424388,2,B00005BJEF,"Having a dynamic menu (vs. static) would be great if they knew how to create one!  What's the point of having menu choices when the cursor is locked out and you have to wait for the recycle or press MENU to play then MENU again to call the intro/menu?
The trip counters blow chunks!  Sometimes the menu recycles, sometimes the first episode plays.  Sometimes episodes autoplay one after the other; sometimes you get dumped to the menu.  At the menu, sometimes the next episode is highlighted, sometimes the first.  Heaven help you if you have a lowly APEX DVD!  The boxes should be a hint since the first two sets of this seven part series are only differentiated by a large sticker on the shrink wrap.",1025654400,,702,4.531746031746032

1424390,5,B00005BJEF,"This is a terrific boxed set, and a great way to relive your Robotech memories of the past.  Each episode is included with beginning and ending credits, as well as commercial break intros.. it might seem like the latter would detract from the enjoyment of viewing, but it only enhances it.  This is especially nice, as in the years following the series' original run we had to put up with a lot of condensed versions of Robotech-- Now we've got it all, just like it was before (or after) school everyday!!
The real treat with the box set (aside from having permanent, pristine copies of your Robotech favorites) is the bonus disc which includes artwork and commentaries.  The commentary by Carl Macek is really terrific, as it lets you in on some of the ""secrets"" behind Robotech.  It took the Robotech team only four months to edit and reduce the original Japanese series in to the three Robotech series, and their work influenced how future Anime would be produced.  If you're at all interested in what went on behind the scenes (so to speak), you'll love his insightful commentary.

1424391,5,B00005BJEF,"I got these after getting a DVD player for Christmas. I loved watching these shows growing up and they are still fun today. I didn't notice any quality issues with the discs. Nobody that I have lent the set to have mentioned anything other than they enjoyed watching them. Also I thought the extra disk that has some interesting footage related to the series was pretty cool, nothing too special though.",1018483200,,403,4.690140845070423
1424392,5,B00005BJEF,"It has been nearly 20 - 25 years ago for me since I've seen this series on Superchannel (TV Channel in Europe, is gone by now) and allthough the drawings aren't state of the art (Anime at its beginning mind you) the storyline is superb.  What _could_ happen if the aliens arrive and we set war on them by accident. This DVD set is brilliant and great value too, especially for customers in Europe.
One big issue; Don't expect hyper modern remastered animation. Instead expect a supreme blast from the past. And after you heard the Robotech intro music DVD style (in the DVD menu, in stereo and crystal clear sound) you know there is no way around it; if you are into this you got to get the soundtrack as well.",1014163200,,710,4.378787878787879
1424393,5,B00005BJEF,"Probably one of the greatest achievements in CARTOON/ANIME history. Robotech is one of the best series you can wish for, in any ANIME collection. Intelligent story, loads of action, soundtrack to dream on, and great voice acting, makes this DVD boxed set, and the whole series a must have.
If you haven't heard of Robotech before, you'll do good in getting this set as a start to your Robotech DVD collection. In todays polluted world of Pokemons and Digimons, it is important to remember the farthers of wisdom, now that the corrupted children has arrived.",1007251200,2,557,4.873684210526315
1424394,4,B00005BJEF,"I'm not a huge fan of the anime style, but this first Robotech series has stuck with me for years. I first saw it when I was in sixth grade, and it really blew me away that a cartoon series would end with the Earth being devastated.
The miltary aspect of the series appealed to me. Unlike other japanese cartoons, where the characters operate outlandish robots or spaceships, here the characters fly fighter jets. Sure, the jets change into giant robots, but the jets seem pratical and almost realistic. The first two episodes contain some nifty dogfights and non-stop action. You get the sense that the crew is stranded in space and fighting for their lives, not on some intergalactic field trip or space exploration mission.
It's not entirely a straight-laced military cartoon, though. The main character, Rick Hunter is your typical ""wild-eyed teenager"". He's rushed into an alien war and thinks he's falling in love with 15 year old girl. Rick's progression into maturity and adulthood is interwoven within the alien conflict. He has a surrogate ""big brother"", Roy Fokker, who guides him along the way. It sounds corny, but Robotech does a good job of mixing romance with the traditional ""grubby little boys' action fare"". Probably a good reason why this cartoon has always appealed to adolescents
There's a few quirks in the show that require some adjustment. First, the aliens are roughly 50 feet tall. This doesn't become appraent until halfway through the series, but it is a nice break from the standard fare of ""normal sized aliens vs. humans"".
It seems bizarre, because the fighter pods the aliens fly around in appear about 50 feet tall, too. Also, early on, they mention that the main battleship, the SDF-1 is ""three quarters of a mile long""... but then a vast city is built inside the ships' hulls. Probably just an audio slip-up, as the SDF appears to be about 10 miles long.
I'm not complaining about the lack of ""re-touched"" or ""remastered' video work. This is how the show first appeared, and I see nothing wrong with it. It's nice to have all the shows on one handy disc. It was almost impossible to tape them all in sequence when it originally aired, and videos are hard to to find and wear out. For a guy who was always intrigued by Robotech, but was never able to locate a complete set, this is the perfect compilation.
The bonus DVD is kind of a waste, though. It includes a 45 minute recap episode, which I believe is verrry similar to the episode ""Gloval's Report"". The tagline proclaims that this episode has ""exclusive"" footage, but I can't spot it. Maybe if I went back and dissected EVERY scene of the series, then I'd find something ""exclusive"". The audio commentary by producer Carl Macek is delivered with all the exuberance of an NPR broadcast. To say he's a boring speaker would be an insult to the all the boring lecturers of the world. Take a drink everytime Macek says ""interesting"", and you'll need a new liver after 15 minutes. I really question the appeal of seeing scenes in foreign languages... you mean other countries speak different languages??! I supose a hard core fan could turn down the audio on their TV, then run on the radio and see their favorite scenes with different dialogue and a ""new perspective"". As it is, I sifted through the bonus disc, trying to find something unique or ""interesting"", but ended up bored and disappointed.
Overall, I'm satisfied with this set and plan on getting sets 2 and 3. The nostalgia factor is appreciated, but even if yer a young buckaroo, this series will
keep you entertained.",1006992000,3,3566,4.734726688102894

1424398,5,B00005BJEF,I don't see why everyone is so damn picky. This set is nice and I feel like I got my moneys worth. Have you tried to rent 1 video at a time at blockbuster? 5 dollars a pop and 2 episodes on each. Calculate that into 2 disks with 12 episodes you get 6 rentals which is $30 bux.

1424399,3,B00005BJEF,"Ok, it's a good story and the animation is average to slightly above average for its time.  The problem is in the packaging.  1 DVD in each box is nothing but extra items.  Without those extras DVDs, we could have saved and bought just two sets with all the important material included.  My advice is to wait and either buy the DVDs separately or wait for ADV to repackage them.  I suspect neither option is likely to occur soon.  I could see 1 DVD of extras, but 3 give me a break.  I give it 3 stars for content but it should get 1 star for packaging.",1004313600,,553,4.11214953271028

I read about people complaining about the quality, but trust me, the quality is much better than what I remember seeing from my college days. I would definately recommend this purchase!",1002499200,,476,4.546511627906977
1424401,5,B00005BJEF,"Well that's how I felt when I got the boxed set. The anticipation before I got it was like some sort of twisted line between pleasure and pain. A gutwrenching wait.
Those of you who don't understand this let me explain. There was this extraordinary anime show that aired in 1985, marketed in 1984 as giant robot models. It was a mess of a licensing mess between Japanese studio/distributors , whatever and an American company that took three different Japanime series and tied them together with a new story and broadcast all over the USA(God bless her).
Of course as a child I never knew all that mess of three different series and licensing. All I knew that this thing was the best thing since Star Wars with a little G-force/Battle of the planets action mixed in it with a little music action going on as well.
There was a tremendous animation style that was rare found in ROBOTECH. A large departure from the Hannah Barbara style. But it was not only the large transforming robots it was also the mature themes that was integral to  the story that made appealed to me.
Of course the large transforming and non-transforming robots were great too! The design of the mecha was superb, It will stand alone even today, not even looking dated. The mecha seemed by design to be functional and believable, just like a lot of the characters were very believable, human.
Ok, why the Gutwrenching?

Because after the mid to late eighties the series disappeared. Even when the show was on TV the merchandise for the show(toys) were elusive.
It was t he Holy Grail to me, finding any kind of veritech
(transforming jet) in any flavor in any brand name or actually any mech from any of the three generations. AHH the woe! The loss The melancholy pain as a child looking in the windows of a closed toy store checking on if they had that Gerwalk/guardian( half plane half robot) toy in the window, and after finding it, saving your money only to find that it was gone. Off to another store.
And then there were the cold years with no robotech at all. Of course those were the years of growing up, discovering girls , sports, other interests . But in my heart I would never forget ROBOTECH! It deeply affected me.
That's why finally getting the boxed set was like a loud blaring
Robert Plant(or insert loud wailing rocker here) soul scream of joy , rocking the hisouse!
Almost everyone I introduce it to loves it, my older sister, my cousin, friends at work, fraternity brothers star wars fans, star trek fans.
This boxed set introduces the series and includes some of the best animation of the Macross saga. The first few episodes will convert almost anyone. I in-fact played some of the first episodes for some of my office mates at an office lunch and they were enthralled.
The first episodes are the best and you will love them. They will suck you in and hypnotize you and keep you wanting more and more robotech. Or you may just like them.
The boxed set is a great deal since you get the extras DVD for almost free. The two episodes DVDS have at least 5 shows per disk. They are pretty cheap too, but with the legacy box set you get a nice package with original art.  The extra features are good, the get more meaty with the other box sets that come after.
All the box sets for Macross that come after, the other two legacy box sets are have similar matching, almost the same exterior cover. Nicely done.
one of my only gripe with the DVDs is that it doesn't come with subtitles in any other languages. Spanish, English and French would have been nice.
The quality of the video is a lot better than the old vhs tapes I had and with 5 eps per $11-12 DVD you get a lot of bang for your buck.
If you watched this show as a kid or at any age when it was on during the eighties you will want this set. It rocks.",1001635200,4,3798,4.415121255349501
1424402,4,B00005BJEF,"I was really jazzed when I heard that ADV was going to release these DVDs, especially since I missed out on the Robotech Perfect Collection.  Finally, I could relive those childhood memories of rushing home and watching Rick Hunter fight the Zentraedi!
Well, childhood memories have turned out to be better than the real thing.  While it's cool to have this whole collection, it's been a reminder of how far animation and storytelling have come since the early 80's.  And I have a big complaint with the music mix; is it just me, or has Harmony Gold gone and changed the music?  I seem to remember different snatches of background music in certain scenes, and I don't think it's fading memory.
Anyway, if you really dig Robotech, buy this collection and watch it.  If you've always wanted to find out what your college buddies were talking about, don't go whole hog and get this entire set.  While it may make a Protoculture Addict out of you, the more discerning animation fan won't be all that excited.",1001376000,2,1004,4.676136363636363

This version is in English and looks the same as it did when I saw it as a kid-- which is just fine.

1424407,5,B00005BJEF,"The Robotech Legacy:  Macross Saga Collection 1, contains episodes 1 through 12 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.  The first two discs contain six episodes each.  The third disc contains all the Exclusive DVD features and is only available if you purchase this boxed set.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z, etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, thrilling battle scenes, futuristic techonology (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Robotechs sweeping saga spanned three seasons and weaved together three actual separate storylines based on Japanese anime:  Season 1 - The Macross Saga, Season 2 - The Robotech Masters (The Southern Cross in Japan), and Season 3 - The New Generation (Mospeada in Japan).  The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed when a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth.  The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come.  As the story unfolds mankind would go on to battle three separate alien races over the next three seasons.  The sweeping intergalactic war saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a deeper human saga.
This Boxed Set contains 3 DVDs.  Heres a listing of what youll find on these discs.
Disc 1  First Contact, episodes 1  6.
1. Booby Trap:  While visiting his friend, Rick Hunter becomes an unwilling fighter pilot in the midst of an alien invasion!!!
2. Countdown:  As Rick struggles to figure out his strange airplane, the SD-F1 struggles to lift off!!!
3. Space Fold:  The SD-F1 warps in order to outflank the alien invaders, unknowingly taking Macross Island with it.

Disc 3  Extra 1:  Elements of Robotechnology  This is the Special DVD features disc that contains all the DVD extras. It is only purchasable if you get the Boxed Set.  On this disc youll find the following:
1.  Codename Robotech:  This is an hour long prelude to the Macross Saga which was limitedly released to certain markets prior to the initial airing of Macross Saga in the mid-80s as an introduction to the series.  It contains a summary of the first 13 episodes of the Macross Saga told as a flashback by Captain Gloval.
2.  Audio Commentary by Carl Macek:  Macek was the producer of the Robotech series.  Macek does a voiceover commentary over the Codename Robotech feature.  It is an invaluable commentary that reveals the series origins, WHY it was produced, HOW the series was produced, etc.  It provides a valuable insight into the cartoon industry, both in the US and Japan.
3.  Character Sketches for all the characters of the Macross Saga.  Pretty cool stuff!!
4.  Clips of Robotech in foreign languages.  This is an awesome and cool feature.  Robotech was released worldwide and here is a small sampling of how other countries and cultures caught all the action.  For our viewing pleasure we can watch the famous clip of Rick and Minmei trapped in the SD-F1 in the following languages:  Spanish, French, Portuguese and Italian!!!
Heres my rundown:
Awesome:  Robotech on DVD, nuff said!!!
Must Listen:  Carl Maceks commentary on the E1 disc.  Its a fascinating look behind the scenes.
Pretty Cool:  Robotech in foreign languages (found on the E1 disc).  Hilarious!!!
Bad:  Nothing at all!!!
If youve never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  It is the series that forever set the standard for Japanese anime.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  Theyre great for a trip down memory lane.  Watching it again now, I can honestly say that its better than I remember.  Give this (and all other current and future releases) a watch.  You won't be disappointed.
If you are planning on purchasing these, by all means pick up the Boxed Set.  Its the only way youll get the Elements of Robotechnology Disc.  Alone, the individual volumes DO NOT come with DVD extras... its still a great bargain for all the action and extras.  Get the Boxed Set.

1424408,5,B00005BJEF,In my mind Robotech always gets a five star or plus but i couldn't get passed the crappy Dvd encoding. Yes true it is a luxuary to have the Saga in Dvd and it is a dream come true... But you cant blame me if i want a little extra from the DVD. The sound quality and the picture quality could be a little better than the regular TV quality. I think the encoding is the sole dislike i had over the dvds. The bonus DVD is superb and it means something extra for the ones like me who first watched Robotech dubbed in Turkish ( or other languages). The box is amazing (Yes i am talking about the cover) it would be foolish to buy the DVDS without the collectible box. It has a very good gravure of a Robotech plane on top... <Sweeeet :)> Just buy it ... Nothing more to say i guess.,996710400,,777,3.9871794871794872

I had mom buy me some of the toys and there's even a role-playing game still available but none of that was as cool as watching this boxed set and thinking about how I felt when I was a kid. This show was and still is very cool. For all of you expecting this HD transfer and Dolby 5.1, forget it! Some of the episodes are soft focused and the audio is in stereo. No widescreen here as this show was made for full screen displays. I engaged Pro Logic and that gives a fairly convincing surround effect. We're talking about an excelent story line, great character development and through the test time cell animation that is still better than most of the domesticated animation your kids watch today! For those of you that have never seen this show, buy it, borrow it or rent it if you can. You can even watch it with your kids if you want or hog it for yourself. Who cares? Episodes 1-12 Introduce us to the Crew of the SDF-1 and the hardships they endure plus it gives us a taste of more to come from the 2nd boxed set.

My 4 year old daughter is currently into Sailor Moon, and I've enjoyed watching the original Japanese versions of the movies on DVD. While I've got to read the subtitiles to understand, the dialogue and inflection is a better match to the action on the screen. I was hoping against hope that these DVDs would include an alternate Japanese version, but they don't. Sure, there are snipets of scenes in other languages, but for my money, that's not enough.
While the production quality isn't as good as it could be, they still beat the old dusty VHS tapes that I made way back when. Fast forwarding through the commercials was a pain!
All in all, these DVDs are a great trip back to the past, and what's better, the stories still hold up. I just wish the final chapter in the Robotech saga had been completed.. We're still waiting for Rick and Lisa to come back to earth!",994723200,,1081,4.520408163265306

Did you expect it to look like a new big budget Walt Disney production just because it's on DVD?  It looks like a mid-80s cartoon because it IS a mid-80's cartoon.
It's also AFFORDABLE.  To make it look beter, you would have to go through and edit the animation cell-by-cell.  Animego is doing just that with the original Japanese Macross series (already a year behind schedule, and still no official release date).  You can see stills of the difference this process makes at robotech.com.
I just got the first box set last night and watched all 12 episodes in one sitting.  I thought it looked and sounded GREAT considering the age of the footage.  Is it ""state of the art""?  Of course not, but if the cost of remastering the animation puts the cost of the set around the cost of my RENT, I'm more than happy with the quality of these discs.",994464000,18,981,4.591954022988506
1424416,3,B00005BJEF,"After gorging on this series as a kid, there was no way I was going to pass this DVD up.  After all, how often do you get a chance to re-live your youth?  Of course, much as was the case with the ""Star Blazers"" DVDs, the difference between my memory of ""Robotech"" and what the series actually *is* is pretty vast.  As a kid, I remember being wowed by the depth and scope of the storytelling (an epic series across 85 episodes, featuring conflict and death) and the quality of animation.  Years later, the animation pales in comparison to what I've seen since (although still several notches above standard TV fare, and I doubt anything else from the '80s has aged as well), the dialogue is mostly tripe, and the ""adult"" storylines I remembered aren't at all.  But as a time capsule, it's absolutely fascinating--if for no other reason to see how much I've changed in 15+ years.  ""Robotech"" still stands as one of the better attempts to market serious anime for an American audience, and it remains a high-water mark, it's just not aged that well.  But then again, neither has ""Star Wars.""
On the quality front, I could quibble about the commercial breaks being left in--why couldn't they have been edited out?  This IS DVD, after all...or the washed out colors and audio, but I doubt they could justify the expense of any sort of re-mastering or clean up.

1424420,3,B00005BJEF,"Finally... after a five-year moratorium, 'Robotech' is back on video- and in DVD format, no less! Now eBay is no longer my last resort (a maddeningly expensive last resort at that) to completing my collection of episodes! Then there's the kicker- six eppies on each disc! Most of my VHS tapes had only two shows per, and each tape originally cost just as much as one DVD. So not only am I getting a great value, I'm also saving mondo shelf space! Boo-Yah!
Then there's the features & extras that comes with this box set. One of the most surprising additions are the between-commercial 'Stay tuned, we'll be right back' bumpers at the midpoint mark of each episode. Then there's the exclusive bonus disc featuring the 'Codename: Robotech' special that was produced to attract viewers to the show. Sadly, after seeing it again for the first time in fifteen years, I found it to be something of a disappointment. Basically, it's just a 75-minute recap featuring snippets from the first 14 episodes, with a slightly different narration by Captain Gloval. The picture quality is rather pathetic, too. Personally, I think it should be viewed more for its historical significance than its entertainment value. The best thing to do is watch it while listening to the Carl Macek commentary track. In his low-key, soft-tone manner, Macek covers the history, production, licensing, ""bloopers"", and other factoids about the making of 'Robotech' as the show plays on. He also discusses the methods and techniques of producing and filming anime, as well as adapting it for the North American market. Also etched into this platter are different foreign-language dubs (French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian) of the Rick Hunter/Lynn Minmei mock marriage scene. There's also a music-&-sound-effects-only track.
But, despite my elation over 'Robotech' being released, I do have a few gripes. For one thing, the sound isn't exactly top notch. But then, the original mix was fairly limited to begin with. Also, it's better than the audio quality of the VHS tapes I used to own, as I could perceive a few of the more subtle sounds that I never noticed before. The picture quality isn't the best either, especially the aforementioned 'Codename: Robotech' special. And I was hoping that Harmony Gold would win the distribution rights for the original Japanese episodes that the series is based on (Macross, Southern Cross, Mospeada) and present both the American eppie and its Japanese originator on the same disc, in a `Perfect Collection' format. You know, a little something for both the `Techie AND the anime purist. No such luck, though- the original 'Macross' series is slated for a separate DVD release, and is getting a full picture & sound restoration. And there's no word yet on the possibility of the other two series being released on the digital format.  Looks like I might not be saving as much shelf space as I originally anticipated...

1424421,2,B00005BJEF,"For those of you who don't already know, what is known in the United States as Robotech started originally as three separate and unrelated cartoons in Japan; Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada.  The three shows were spliced together and dubbed into English, in an attempt to create a single story thread.  According to the first Palladium Robotech roleplaying game book, no new material was ever added to the original Japanese footage.  The only thing quintessentially American about Robotech is the name.
I think enough has already been said about the quality (or lack thereof) of the DVD collection.  Personally, I would have preferred to wait for a subtitled edition, but then it wouldn't have been called Robotech, now would it?
The one thing I can say about this DVD collection is that you definitely get your money's worth.  With six episodes on a disc, we could only hope that the other anime producers (or rather translators) would pick up on the trend and release more episodes on a single DVD, rather than charge $20 and up for barely 30 minutes of footage.",993859200,4,1070,4.857142857142857
1424422,3,B00005BJEF,"As a long-time fan of the Robotech genre and the author of a modestly popular Robotech novel...I have to scratch my head regarding this latest release of Robotech on DVD. Despite nearly twenty years of technological advancement these DVDs are no better than the VHS tapes released by Palladium Books in the late 1980s or the Laserdiscs incompletely released by FHE in the mid-1990s. The sound has not improved, nor has the footage, which looks old. Contrast this with the Animego ""Macross"" DVD project which includes digital restoration of both print and audio and one begins to wonder if Robotech's copyright owners are just after a quick buck on their way toward burying Robotech for good. (Indeed, everything with Robotech's license from toys to videos to books, with the exception of Tom Bateman's ""Robotech: Perfect Collection Soundtrack"" has been sorely lacking.)

 Carl Macek took three unrelated Japanese television shows and managed to change the dialogue enough to link them all together. In the process he unwittingly created a marvelous piece of storytelling. Though the characters sometimes contradict themselves in words and action (a result of the rushed nature of the Robotech project's production) it is a truly wonderful thing, the first--and probably last--epic of its kind.

 Though the quality is poor, even dismal, given the technology available, I plan to purchase the entire set and highly recommend it to anyone who has in his heart affection for this show. Despite its shortcomings, this is the most convenient format to date for viewing the Robotech Saga--and may very well be the last, so get it while you can. For those who have not seen it, take a look...you will be pleasantly surprised.",993772800,,1718,5.103202846975089

It has action, adventure, drama, and humor. Not since I saw Babylon 5 for the first time have I felt any real attachment to carachters in a show. It is very easy to lose yourself in the plot of this story. If you like good science fiction, buy this set now!
As for the things I didn't like, they are mostly technical issues. I would really have liked to have had a 5.1 digital audio track. The absence of this feature was kind of a let down, but it doesnt really detract from my enjoyment of the DVD. Also, I think the video clip that starts the dvd could have been ommitted, though the menu looks nice. The commercial break animations are neat, but I think they would have been better as an extra rather than inserting them in the middle of the episode. Oh and one more thing...this is NOT the original Macross anime. It is the americanized Robotech version. If you are looking for the original anime series find it elsewhere. However, if you can accept the fact that this is a different story all together then you will not be disapointed.

The set contains the first 12 episodes of robotech. The story line and characters are great. The animation is just what I would expect from a '80s t.v. show. Don't go expecting a Titan AE experience from this DVD. It's like they did an exact transfer from the Master VHS tapes. The quality is good and I couldn't notice any flicker or screen problems but I would have liked to have seen a revamped picture and possibly a transfer to anamorhic widescreen.
I had to change this review a little bit in regards to the sound.  When i first played the set it was just on my regular tv since my Dolby Digital reciever was in for repair.  I just assmued the whole thing was in stereo.  But after looking at the DVD box itslef it says DD right on the back.  So it looks like the series does support the DD sound as well.

1424427,3,B00005BJEF,"One thing I can't stand, is people who review a product based upon previous viewings, not upon the quality of the product itself.  I picked up a copy of this boxed set yesterday, and have taken a look at most of it.  If your a fan of the show, or a fan of Japanese anime generally, you know what you're going to get with Robotech.  This is a series that attempts to combine dramatic storytelling with the best elements of science fiction.  Based upon the success and popularity of the show, it largely succeeds.  The characters have a broad range of emotions and react to the trials and tribulations that they all experience.  Love,loss, and sacrifice are all motivations for the characters in this series.  Macross, the first series, focuses upon young people who face adversity of first contact with an alien race that is both hostile and militarily superior.  Against this backdrop is a love story.  The hero, Rick Hunter, struggles to find his place, both as a warrior/military leader while also navigating the hazards of true love.  I don't think I need to say too much more in the way of the actual series.  The art is gorgeous, having set the standards for anime in the 1980s.  The voice actors are excellent.  You don't even notice that the language is dubbed.  This epic series set the standard for anime in the USA and it continues to survive the test of time.
The DVD production is another story.  The master print does not appear to have been cleaned up in any way.  Compared with other DVDs, the print appears quite grainy.  It's a tv cartoon from the 1980s and this is exactly what it looks like.  Just don't go in expecting this to be a polished special edition.  The extras are not particularly impressive.  The art collection is largely duplicative of material that has appeared in printed works.  The sound track is rather tinny, and lacks the fullness of most modern productions.  This is probably because the original production was designed for mono television via the airwaves, but compared to most modern DVDs it lacks the fullness that you would come to expect.  THe two hour movie included on the extra disk is nothing more than a shorter version of the first several episodes.  The audio commentary by Carl Macek (the producer) was interesting.  It provides a nice historical perspective of the series and insights into the production.  However, unlike movie commentaries, it really doesn't track the sequence of scenes on the screen.  You can listen to the commentary without watching any of what is taking place on the screen.  I must say that my copy of the extras disk has a glitch.  One of the tracks continually jams my DVD player.  I have not had this problem with any other DVDs.  I'll probably look to exchange my set for another copy.  I don't know whether this is merely a problem with my set or whether it may be representative of larger manufacturing difficulty.  I simply point this out because anyone who buys this product should probably check theirs out as soon as possible.  Despite these complaints, this is still the best production of the Robotech series to date.  While the quality is comparable to the earlier video tape releases, this is still the nicest production of the Robotech series for home release, and it sure beats my grainy video tapes.",993340800,35,3297,4.704545454545454
1424428,4,B00005BJEF,"I know everyone's already said something about this, but i'm going to add to the ""Robotech vs Macross Saga"" debate here:
The entirely American Robotech series is based loosely on the popular Macross series of Japan.  Anyone who has read the manga the anime is based on understands this difference.  Players of the Palladium RPG know in even more intimate detail the differences between the mecha of the two series, as well as the characters.
The two series are not even remotely related.
As far as Robotech goes (which is what this product happens to be), the series had a solid start, and a great idea.  Given how long ago it was released (relative to other, newer popular anime series'), Robotech has maintained reasonable popularity, and for good reason.  It has all the basic elements of a quality production: action, adventure, intrigue, romance, and gadgetry.  Despite the often low quality animation (some combat scenes are simply cut and paste repeats of earlier ones, etc), Robotech remains timeless, having spawned not only several major motion pictures (none of which ever hit the states), but also a series of novels (the non-graphic variety, published by del-rey), several pen&paper roleplaying games, several video games (the n64 project, ""Crystal Dreams"", kind of fell through), a series of toys (the veritechs are non transformable, much to everyone's distaste), a series of models, and other assorted memorabilia.",993254400,2,1430,5.1731601731601735
1424429,2,B00005BJEF,"Well, here's why.  The only reason it's not 1 is because I've enjoyed the story and it reminds me of when I watched this when I was a kid. Guess what folks?  Why is the box set so cheap?  ADV decided they'd just slap the series onto the dvd's and not do ANYTHING with them!  6 episodes per disc, and it's pretty much the same quality as the tapes...with the picture quality and sound wear and tear to show for it!!!
Well folks, if you're nostalgic for this series and you watched it as a kid, then I recommend this ONLY because of that.  If you've been watching anime recently, you WILL notice a significant loss of quality in the animation.  As long as you're willing to suffer watching the show in it's low quality, then by all means.  I've looked at the AnimeIgo screen shots of digital enhancement and BOY OH BOY, it looks awesome!  Too bad it's all in Japanese and will be subtitled, and the fact that I've never watched this version before.
In a nutshell, buy this if you're nostalgic and can withstand the poor picture and sound quality.  Buy the AnimeIgo version, (which is a totally different story by the way) if you don't mind subtitles, hearing Japanese, and watching a different story.

I cant wait for the second set coming out in August.",993081600,,810,4.1923076923076925
1424431,5,B00005BJEF,"This boxed set contains three discs; Robotech: First Contact, Robotech: Transformation and Robotech Extra Disc 1. Since the first two discs can be bought seperetly, my review will be on the extras disc.
As you already know, the extra disc includes Codename: Robotech. C:R is basically episodes 13 and 14 (both not included in this boxed set) which are streched into a 75 minute pilot. But how is that possible? Episode 14 is a recap episode so the flashbacks were continued to a longer extent then in episode 14. One thing I hated about it though was the poor video quality of it. That's right. This was copied off a low grade VHS tape I'll bet. There is tons of line noise and even some scenes where the framerate seems to lag. However, this pilot also includes commentary by Carl Macek, so that made it worth it. Mr. Macek talked about a lot of things including about Robotech toy lines, broadcasting rights, where the voice actors are now and even points out some little mistakes in the animation. That was the best extra on the disc. Furthermore, there is a character production sheet gallery featuring 33 different sheets of all the characters in the Macross Saga. The International Clip is of when Minmei and Rick commence a pretend wedding. The French audio sounded like it was recorded in a tin can, but the acting was good. The Spanish track has better audio quality then the French and has some nice voice acting. The Italian and Portugese tracks were by far the best. Rick actually sounds like more of a man in Portugese.
So overall, this boxed set is must for fans and non-fans alike. And you still get 12 episodes with the set. Now that's a deal. If you haven't done so yet, buy it now. It is well worth it's weight in gold and then some.",992908800,8,1751,4.526813880126183

7937626,4,B00005BJEF,"I'm 36 years old now but I remember with great clarity my first viewing of Robotech when it aired on my TV back in 1985. The plot was rich. The action was amazing. The transformable vehicles were spectacular. And main characters could and often did die. Robotech became a serious habit for me and you could be sure that at 4:30 every afternoon my TV was tuned in to it. At the time I had no concept how difficult a show it was to put together and air for producer Carl Macek and the staff at Harmony Gold. It aired for one season and then suddenly disappeared, only to reappear at sporadic moments on reruns years later on Sci-Fi channel.

Robotech was never designed to be what it was. Carl Macek, the producer, originally managed to get syndication rights from Tatsunoko Productions, a Japanese anime feature producer but discovered that the cartoons he got were originally meant to be played one episode a week in Japan. Syndicated cartoons in the US usually ran 5 episodes a week, thus he faced an issue. If he ran Macross the show would essentially run out within a couple of weeks of airtime, which was simply unworkable with the networks with whom he was trying to negotiate the deal. Macek and his writers faced a dilemma; How to ""stretch"" the show out to fill the desired 65 episode span that other cartoon features required in order to get aired. Thus, Macek tacked on two other anime features he had acquired rights to, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada. He changed the story dramatically from it's original intent, making three separate productions that had nothing to do with each other into one enormous, epic story. Whether you love Carl Macek or hate him, one cannot deny that without his direct influence anime would never have achieved the level of popularity that it now has in the US.

Would that I could review the whole Robotech series from ADV I would, but as it stands each box set contains 12 episodes (3 for Book 1 - the Macross saga, 2 for Book 2 - the Southern Cross, and 2 for Book 3 - The New Generation).

This particular set comprises the first 12 episodes of Book 1 - Macross, and tells the story of how the Earth took possession of the SDF-1, it's discovery and implementation of Robotechnology as a result, and it's ensuing fight with the warlike Zentraidi, who have come to the Earth to reclaim the SDF-1. The animation is nice but most will probably agree that it's not as pretty as the stuff that's put out today. Bear in mind though that this was top of the line stuff for the mid-80's and a lot of people fell in love with the anime concept. The main characters run the gamut of various archetypes; the seasoned squadron commander (Roy Fokker), the stuffy yet vulnerable Flight Operations Officer (Lisa Hayes), the modest ace (Max Stirling), the up and coming rookie/hero of the story (Rick Hunter), and the iconic dream girl that Rick yearns for to the detriment of himself and those around him (Lynn Minmay). I think it's safe to say that any fans of the series agree that at any given time each of us wanted to strangle Minmay at some point or another, but she's necessary for plot progression so we put up with her.

The stars of the show are supplemented (but never outdone) by the other stars of the show, namely the Mecha. I remember thinking that Veritech fighters were the coolest thing I had ever seen. There was just the right amount of mixture of conventional forces (helicopters, jet fighters, etc.) and Robotechnology to make the show believeable. The animation was crisp and the pilots of these futuristic fighters did things in their respective fighters that was beyond your average pre-teen's imagination.

That said, Robotech, good as it is, has not aged particularly well. The biggest hindrance is probably the voice acting. The main players do quite well (Aline Leslie as Lisa Hayes probably doing best overall) but one simply cannot escape the scourge of Minmay. Her squeaky voice and numerous childish exclamations make it so that this is a program you will never want to watch in the open around others who have not seen it before. I simply hit the pause button when my wife is walking through the room, especially if Minmay is on. She is a necessary evil to the story, however, and in many places is required to move the plot along. There's no way around her. I think one could devise a drinking game based upon how many times she dedicates her ""new song"" (which is actually the same song she sings over and over again) to various people and/or causes throughout the story, making me want to throttle her. The only other character that ran a close second in the revulsion factor is Dana Sterling in the Southern Cross Saga. You may also feel the urge to kick the living (censored) out of Lynn Kyle, Minmay's cousin, when he jaunts onto the screen.

The show is largely bowdlerized so this is a program you could easily show your kids (and a large step above the nonsensical crap they show on TV nowadays) and I daresay they'd probably enjoy it.

And now on to the technical stuff. Each DVD set you receive is top-notch. Besides the two episode DVD's you also get a 3rd DVD which typically has extras on it. Everything from concept sketches, character profiles, to the original commercials aired for the program can be found on the various Extras DVD's. As a bonus one set includes ""Robotech II: The Sentinels"" which was Carl Macek's pitch for a second Robotech season. The big fight between the Robotech Master's Bioroids and the Invid alone is worth the price of admission. There was some grain in the images but nothing serious enough to detract from my score. I cannot pretend to be able to understand or decipher technical speak, but I will say that there is image shift from episode to episode. The only place it's really noticeable is during the opening credits where the film strip starts scrolling downwards. Ideally the edges of the film would be centered perfectly, but I've noticed a number of episodes where it was far veered to the right in varying degrees. This has little overall effect on the show, however. By and large this is a purchase I was very glad to have made and I've watched the series several times since I purchased this set several years ago. If you haven't watched Robotech since it's original airing in 1985 be prepared to cringe at some of the dialogue, but other than that you will be very well pleased with the overall experience and will treasure your DVD set!",1227744000,2,6495,4.618181818181818
7937627,4,B00005BJEF,"Robotech: The Macross Saga - Legacy Collection 1 is a three-disc DVD box set that was released in 2001 by ADV Films.  The first disc contains the first six episodes of the Macross portion of Robotech, and the second disc contains episodes seven through twelve of the Macross portion.

The third DVD in the set is labeled as ""Extra Macross Saga 1 - Elements of Robotechnology.""  This DVD contains all of the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is Codename: Robotech, which is a ""film"" that starts about halfway through the episode ""Blue Wind"" and goes through the episode ""Gloval's Report"" (which was basically a ""clip show"" that recapped what happened in the series up to that point).  There is also a version of this feature with audio commentary provided by Carl Macek, which gives a history of the Robotech property, as well as explains the Codename: Robotech ""film.""  This feature also has a ""hidden Easter egg""; there is an unlisted audio track, which is a music-only track for Codename: Robotech.

Another extra on the set is animation model sheets.  There are thirty-three pages of characters included: Rick Hunter, Lynn Minmei, Lisa Hayes, Roy Fokker, Claudia Grant, Captain Gloval, Maximillian Sterling, Miriya, Ben Dixon, Lynn Kyle, Kim Young, Sammie Porter, Vanessa Leeds, Dana Sterling, Jason (Lynn Minmei's cousin), Breetai, Exedore, Khyron, Dolza, Azonia, Bron, Rico, and Konda.  It should be noted that the images for Kim and Sammie are mislabeled (Kim's name was put next to Sammie's face, while Sammie's name was put next to Kim's face).

The last feature is ""International Clip.""  It's the scene where Rick and Minmei are rescued after being trapped in the SDF-1 for almost two weeks. The clip is available in English, French, Spanish, Portugese, and Italian.  However, I'm puzzled about why the original Japanese clip wasn't included; there's nothing inappropriate in the footage for the original Japanese clip that would have prevented ADV Films from using it for the ""International Clip"" feature.

Overall, this is a decent DVD box set.  However, I wish ADV Films had gone to more effort to remaster the video for the release (when you watch the Super Dimension Fortress Macross box set released by AnimEigo, you can see that the footage that appears on that set is much sharper and clearer than what appears on this release).",1227571200,,2371,5.0
7937628,5,B00005BJEF,"With a stroke of success in the 80's, the Robotech: Macross series still has a place for many fans today and shares a strong cult following.  Being a fan of the series as a kid, I decided to buy the whole Robotech: Macross series, but I came across the overwelming amount of editions to the series.  I didn't know which to buy, so I watched them all.  Here are the differences between to different boxsets (all offered through Amazon):

Robotech: the Complete Macross Series
One Boxset: 6 disc
Sells for around $60-$65
Nothing special, picture quality is not great, but bearable.  Comes in one compact boxset with all the disc in it.  Would not reccomend getting this edition unless you just want a copy of the series and want to spend the least possible amount of money.

Robotech: The Legacy Collection: Macross Saga (Collections 1-3)
Three Boxsets: with 3 disc in each
Sells for around $40 each boxset, entire set around $120-$130
Same picture quality as the above set, but with addtional features.  Comes with the most extras out of any current sets, but even then, they are so-so.  I would actually recommend getting the above edition as I was not impressed with the extras, some were interesting, but it definately didn't justify the price.  Your paying almost twice the price.

Robotech Remastered: The Macross Saga (Volumes 1-3)
Three Boxsets: Two disc each boxset
Sells for around $25 each boxset, entire set around $75-$80
Remastered picture quality superior to both sets above, sound quality much improved.  This is the set that I would recommend.  The price is affordable and well worth the extra money compared to the first set.  Also includes a few bonus footage.

Macross: Super Dimensional Fortress (Sets 1-3)
Three Boxsets: Three discs each boxset
Sells for around $60-$70 each boxset, entire series around $180-200
Macross is the original Japanese series of the Robotech: Macross Saga.  The storyline is slightly different with different music and sounds.  When it was brought to the US, Harmony Gold added the Macross material with two other Japanese series to make Robotech.  Macross is more ""mature"" and includes several scenes taken out of Robotech.  Picture quality is even more crisp than the Remastered Series.  I would reccomend only to die-hard Robotech fans.  It's pretty expensive and lacks really any real extra features.",1086825600,,2351,4.992287917737789

7937630,1,B00005BJEF,"Originally I had high hopes for this set, after all they used the name Macross on the title.  However after popping the DVD in I was severely disappointed.  Not only is the childish dubbing still present, it is also the cut, convulated American version.  You see ""Robotech"" is a whole bunch of Macross sagas tied together for America messing up alot of the story line.
If you are interested in the original and pure version you are better off buying the AnimEigo versions, they don't have any special features but it is the true vision of Macross.",1047427200,5,547,4.618556701030927
7937631,5,B00005BJEF,"Robotech is a series I missed back in the '80s (as it aired against some of my existing favorite shows on Saturday mornings), but watching this disc, I can easily understand what the ""fuss"" has been about. While definitely a product of the '80s (note the titles and a few obvious moments of obvious visual and dialogue editing for US audiences), the series has definite depth, and a cohesive storyline that was previously impossible for American cartoons (thanks to problems with airing orders and general meddling from the Big Three TV networks). The narration is concise and, when needed, quite extensive, which helps ease the neophyte viewer into the show while in no way harming the style of the series.
One negative point is that the video isn't restored. Of course, given the nature of this series (a heavily edited and re-edited showing of three very different television shows), I'm not surprised. However, the video is at the same level as the original broadcasts (which unfortunately speaks ill of how TV shows were broadcast in the days before cable was in most of our homes), and everything is included (even commercial bumpers, recaps, and previews). The special features disc is equally loaded, with a special premeire movie (and commentary by Carl Macek, who is for all intents the ""creator"" of Robotech) and a series of character model sheets.
While certainly dated, with its sometimes primitive animation and now-unimaginable dubbing policies, Robotech is an essential series for all cartoon fans, and (naturally) this set is the best place to start.",1046476800,,1567,5.054054054054054

Any long term fan of Robotech will have noticed that the tapes became unavalble a few years back and for those of us who did not have all the tapes and forgot to record the shows off Cartoon Netword this is a God sent gift.  Robotech is the story of the power the human heart.  It also deals with a lot of issues such as war in a deep maner but not in the overly dramic way that you see in shows such as Gundam Wing.  This DVD set includes great features so get a good deal in that way too.  If you are just coming across Robotech then its best if you view this set before going to the others or buying the great books.  If you are an anime fan looking for blood, guts, etc. then go else where (not that I don't like blood and guts myself).  While Robotech is a show of war it is not a grafic anime.  Also be warn if you buy this one you will most likely be buying all the rest.  Goodness knows I did.",1042761600,,969,3.8535353535353534
