8391203,3,B0038C19D4,"Les Miserables is the short English version, NOT the 6hr French version w/ English subtitles

I almost bought this.

Then I decided to look for the same item online elsewhere to see if I could find a review. I then stumbled across the link to another seller, and they had this gem, ""Please note that Les Miserables is in English, not French."" [...]

According to IMDB, the English version is only 180 minutes, rather than the full 360 minute version (4 part mini-series, 90 minutes each). [...]

I saw the French version on A&E (tv station in the USA) with English subtitles, and I do believe their is a VHS version, but no DVD French 360 minute version w/ English subtitles.

I'd be happy to be wrong about this version (please comment to let me know), or let me know if you can find the 360 minute French w/ English subtitles on DVD (region 1 or 0 preferred).",1345680000,9,861,4.424050632911392

Gerard Depardie is a master and these DVD provide a few of his mater pieces. You will feel transported in time.",1321228800,4,212,4.0476190476190474
