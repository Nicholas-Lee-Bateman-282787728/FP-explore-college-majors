7924523,4,B00004W3HH,"A flying cow, an artist with seven fingers, two lovers engaged in an  intimate kiss but one of them has an elongated neck that resembles a snake  and then we see the face of a fiddler, a green face. What in the world are  these images doing on a canvas? Is the artist insane or just playing with  our minds? If you have come across those images, welcome to the world of  Marc Chagall who captivated art lovers for over half a century.
  Who  is this man? We are given a guided tour of his works and life by an artist  who is trying to figure out the same question. He does this by taking us to  the places where Chagall worked, introduces us to Chagall's techniques as a  painter and explores the impact of his personal life on his art. Born in a  Jewish Ghetto in Russia and later moving to Paris, Chagall rose to become  the greatest artist of his time.
  Many of his critics and even our  narrator had problems with his style, his use of light and his lack of  explaining what he was seeking to convey in his pictures. Since Chagall  feels no need to explain, he is called a Mystic, in a negative since.  Mystics of course have their heads in the air and have no idea of what they  are doing. Of all the major flaws of this video I would say the incessant  need to explain and analyze Chagall takes away from the viewer the ability  to make up their own minds. Chagall speaks for himself in his paintings  infused with thems from Russia, the Bible and his own sense of whom he is.  Of special note was Chagall's work in stained glass a medium which one  wouldn't think such a person could be effective since his medium is the  pallete and canvas. Overall this is a good video in introducing you to the  artistic works of the artist as well as his life. Oh, as a  ""Mystic"" artist Chagall does an outstanding job in touching your  spirit through his works that few artists can achieve.",969148800,19,1886,4.248587570621469
