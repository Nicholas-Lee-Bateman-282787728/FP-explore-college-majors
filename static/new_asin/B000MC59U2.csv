8167725,1,B000MC59U2,"super grainy picture  for price should have been remastered.  watched for hour and twenty minutes and froze up. last 10 minutes not viewable.  Also disc had scratches with an S.  thats the reason i do not buy used.  Some type of shrink-wrap inserted in case presumably to avoid movement, did not work to well.  Very disappointed with manufacturer.",1466812800,,347,4.896551724137931
8167726,5,B000MC59U2,"From 1961, this vampire film as some critic has already mentioned lacks the more chilling or impressive aspects of some later vampire films. It is nothing like American vampire films starring Bela Lugosi or Christopher Reeves. The Mexican actor who portrays the head vampire played the same part in various films. He has a touch of sex and elegance as well as wicked intensity. The plot: a brilliant pianist in decent society is truly a vampire who controls people with music- an organ. He has a huge vendetta against the Coleman family who are vampire-hunters. He makes one of the Coleman daughters into a vampire and is about to do the same to another when he is stopped in his tracks by a vampire hunter who catches on to his power and plays the organ so that the vampires become inactive. The film is long and talky and there are only a few moments of real horror. Most of the film depends on the mood and the atmosphere. It is well done for what it is but it's in Spanish and it's a low-budget production and should only be viewed by Mexican horror fans who would truly appreciate its place in cinema.",1459123200,,1106,4.48019801980198

8167728,1,B000MC59U2,"The World of the Vampires (Alfonso Corona Blake, 1960)

I thought I had seen the worst films ever made; obviously I was wrong. The World of the Vampires is such a cheesefest that it makes movies like Plan 9 from Outer Space and Manos: The Hands of Fate look like Oscar material. And yet The World of the Vampires is the kind of flick that transcends badness and becomes something worthy of reverence; it is so truly bad that it's inevitable people will begin to worship it.

The story is about a vampire, Count Subotai (Six Tickets to Hell's Guillermo Murray), who has a century-long feud with the Colman family, who, if I followed things correctly, made him a vampire in the first place. The last remaining members of the Colman family are a father (Jose Baviera) and his two daughters, Leonor (Erna Bauman) and Marta (Silvia Fournier). A friend of the family, Rodolfo Sabre (Mauricio Garces), studies music, and has collected a number of pieces that are ""shocking"" to the human ear, and even more so to vampires. (Funny, to me they all sounded kind of like Sousa marches.) Yes, all this ties together, somehow.

In all honesty, I think that had I seen the flick with its original dialogue, I probably wouldn't have found it so terrible; Paul Nagle, the ""director of the English-language version"", because you had those things back then (in other words, he oversaw the dubbing), spent far more time thinking about how the dubbing was going to match the moving lips, and none at all, I don't think, about whether the dialogue was actually any good. It ain't. Maybe the original was better.

Despite that, however, there are the special effects. Oh, my, the special effects. They're hysterical. They are truly the reason to watch this movie; you'll be in stitches within minutes. Granted, this sort of thing gets old after a while (though you have to admire a director who, after Garces inadvertently knocks over a coffin and sends a whole stack of them to the ground like dominoes, refuses to cut the scene!), but it's certainly worth one run through just to get the full awful glory of how bad these special effects really are; the vampire teeth that our vampires suddenly sprout were obviously bought at the five and dime. (And they slip now and again, which just adds to the hilariousness. Vampire dentures?) And the bats. Oh, lord the bats. You have to see them to believe them.

It's a terrible movie, but you must see it at least once. You'll remember it forever. *",1219190400,,2471,4.671264367816092
