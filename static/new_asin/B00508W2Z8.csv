4513702,5,B00508W2Z8,"I'm not going to talk about this film's story. You can check IMDb for that-- or some of the other reviews here on Amazon. They cover that subject well.
This is only about the new DVD from Olive Films.

I received my long-awaited DVD of ""Colossus/NY"" yesterday (Aug. 8) and played it last night. (I didn't buy it here;-- I pre-ordered mine from DeepDiscount.)

My only other copy of this film was a VHS tape, purchased from the now-defunct HellFire Video in New York City. They were the only folks who offered it, way back when.--

The source print that HellFire used was very poor. It was dark and muddy. It could sometimes be difficult to make out much of what was on screen, especially backgrounds.
I kept that tape, anyway, because it was all I had. ""Colossus"" rarely made it to TV, or I would have recorded my own copy (off TV) long ago.

Well....now I can toss that tape! The Olive Films DVD of the film isn't perfect, but it's very close! It's a really, really good job, and should satisfy any ""Colossus"" fan. The B&W image is clean and clear, the sound is also clear, and the film is presented in it's original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78-1.

There are no extras, but that's fine with me. I'm just pleased to have a good quality print of ""Colossus"" after all these years.

I highly recommend this disc to those who want to enjoy this really eerie movie!",1312848000,47,1364,4.436

4513704,4,B00508W2Z8,"I first saw this movie back in 1959 (age 8) and I found it so incredibly creepy in that it was
the epitome of malevolent sci-fi behavior (Gort). I was awestruck at his incorrigible mind set
and was freaked out when he fried everybody at the United Nations forum. The scene where he walks
across the floor of the East River was over the top. This film is a masterpiece much in the
same vein as the 'Quatermass' films.

4513705,4,B00508W2Z8,"I fully agree with Vito's comments.
This was one of those diamonds in the rough... forgotten (actually, ignored in it's time) gem that so stands out in it's dark way. Obviously of extremely low budget, it's brilliant director makes that fact almost irrelevant as he crafts an off-kilter, noirish sci fi thriller that, while typical of many 50's genre movies, stands apart in so many ways. The titled robot is a way cool, original design. Think Gort as costumed by ""Things to Come"".
I have this on VHS. So hoping the DVD release does it justice. Which is why I am reserving a star until then. I WILL be checking this out!",1311206400,8,620,4.544642857142857
4513706,5,B00508W2Z8,"Finally, this classic gem from 1958 is getting a proper DVD release. This is one of my all-time favorite science fiction flicks.

Ross Martin plays a brilliant scientist who is tragically killed in an accident at an airport. His father, a brilliant brain surgeon played by Otto Kruger, can't deal with his son's death, so removes his brain and keeps it alive in a basement laboratory. He then enlists the aide of his other son to build a robotic body in which to house the brain. Once encased in steel, the brain continues to function - dangerously.

When I was a kid back in the '70s, this was one of those movies I had to watch every time it aired. I couldn't get enough of it. The robot in this movie is one of the coolest film robots ever. Plus the move has a very unique musical score. It's all piano but it is very effective. It more than captures the entire tragic aura of the story. I can't wait to get this DVD. Hopefully the transfer is magnificent. I'll update this posting after I get it.

Luckily, his other son is brilliant in the field of automation. This film has some great ideas, but with low budget effects. To be truthful, I thought it slows down halfway in, but it picks up and concludes with action, pathos, and a message. I checked the IMDB for the original aperture rating. It's 1.66:1.

4513717,5,B00508W2Z8,"Dr. Jeremy ""Jerry"" Spensser (Ross Martin) has big ideas for the end of everything from hunger to world war, all through his breakthroughs in automation. Tragically, while in Stockholm to receive a well-deserved peace prize, Spensser meets w/ a grisly end. Unable to accept his son's death, his father, Dr. William Spensser (Otto Kruger), devises a way to allow his son to ""live"". First, he disembodies Jeremy's brain, keeping it alive through electric / chemical means. Then, w/ the help of Jeremy's brother, Henry (John Baragrey), Jeremy is given a new, ""improved"" body for his brain. Can Jeremy be convinced that his mind is far too important to die? Even while he only wants to be destroyed? If so, how long can he possibly continue? In addition, Jeremy seems to have acquired incredible psychic abilities. Not surprisingly, something goes horribly awry, when Jeremy grapples w/ his feelings for his wife and son.  Ultimately, Jeremy's worldview takes a terrifying turn. THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK is a truly fantastic science fiction film from 1958. Filled w/ moral dilemmas and pathos, it's above much of the usual cheeeze / schlock of the period. If you enjoy movies like FRANKENSTEIN or ROBOCOP -which was clearly influenced by this film- then COLOSSUS should be a genuine treat!...",1449273600,,1287,5.042253521126761

No cheap thrills, titillation, gratuitous violence. Everything fits together, tells the story, and expands the imagination. Special effects are just enough and not too much. Acting is sufficient to draw you in to the characters. Pacing is just right. The music is very interesting, it is a lone piano. The simple music sets the movie apart.

Some of the performances were a little stiff and forced but once in a while I give them a break on the acting if the story is good. there was a piano soundtrack and I found it fit the story very well. If you are wondering why 4 stars instead of 5, the robot gave off a buzzing sound that grated on me terribly. Keep in mind that this was the late 50's so the ""special effects"" were what they were and it was fine and fun. I do recommend this movie for fans of the 50's scifi genre. Enjoy.

He keeps it alive and places it in a large, intimidating robot.  He figures his son's brain is ALL that is important from his son's life and wants sonny boy to continue his work for world peace by ending world hunger.  (If that was the only thing creating wars we wouldn't need a genius to solve the world's troubles).  Naturally sonny boy gets fed up with his sterile life and starts developing ESP and a sense of godlike power.  The scenes when he travels underwater are surreally effective.  The piano score is alternately suitably somber and jarring.  The robot is un-nerving and when the brain works overtime the sounds of short-circuiting makes you think the whole thing is going to blow.

4513736,4,B00508W2Z8,"Nice to finally be able to upgrade to this handsome Olive Films version of this cool, old sci-fi film. Now I can toss that crummy public domain copy I have in the trash. Picture here is very crisp & clear, blacks are solid and the mid tones look nice as well. Looks worlds better than previous versions I've seen before. Sound is also nice & clean for the most part, but be warned that in some sections of the film the electronic ""crackling"" of the Colossus's brain drowns out portions of Ross Martin's dialogue, which can be kind of irritating. I cannot tell if this is the fault of the original soundtrack or the mastering process.

Story is a sort of modernized Frankenstein. Ross Martin is a terrific actor but he's only in the picture for the first reel. After that, he is only heard as the voice of the metal behemoth. The design of the Colossus is very cool and quite unique. The only ""bad"" thing I can say about it are the mesh sections on his upper cheek, just below the eyes. These are obviously ports that the suit actor used to see out of the mask. They should have been slits, placed along the underside of the glowing eyes and blacked out with shading/paint. Other than that, the whole design looks really great. I love the layered robe he wears; very noble looking.  The big stack-heeled boots are equally impressive and show a nice overall attention to detail. It would have been much easier to have slapped a pair of clunky black ""Herman Munster"" asphalt boots on the suit actor. The flashy chromed & riveted side and top trim bracing make the feet stand out and look sturdy and powerful, without looking gaudy. To me they look like something Jack Kirby would have designed for Galactus. The sculpted hands are very skeletal-looking; something I never noticed in previous viewings. Most likely this is because prints of this film I've seen prior to this new Olive Film release were so scratchy and murky that much of the suit's impressive details were too washed out to see.

This is not a great film, but it is fun and certainly worth a look, especially if you're a fan of 50's sci-fi. The only negative thing I can really say about this film is the piano-only score by Van Cleave. I find it particularly grating. It's definitely an avant garde attempt that sets this film apart, but much like the blaring jazz score found in PANIC IN YEAR ZERO, it detracts from the film rather than adding to it. To me it often sounds like someone just pounding on the keys. You might like it better. Thanks to Olive Films for rescuing this obscure title and giving it a decent mastering treatment. I doubt it's ever looked better. Overall, I give this rare sci-fi film 4 stars.",1393545600,2,2681,4.512345679012346
4513737,5,B00508W2Z8,This film evoked a mood of futuristic effect with Gothic mood to create a film classic. Execution in noir style black and white photography gives film a timeless quality. Piano film score perfectly matches visual style. Pathos of father/robot-son relationship tempers story with a bittersweet humanity. Can see this movie being extremely popular with Japanese audience. It'd be a wonderful remake project if done with more live action than CGI. I would certainly like to see that happen.,1392595200,,487,5.256410256410256
4513738,4,B00508W2Z8,"To preface these remarks, look elsewhere for plot synopses, critiques of the film itself, etc. There's plenty of info on that stuff all over the internet. MOST of my remarks concern only the BluRay disc itself, and my feelings about its merits, etc.
I have to confess a special love from this film since I saw it as a child. Maybe the inclusion of the Charles Herbert character caused me to identify with it as a young boy. Plus the robot is pretty damn cool-looking, no doubt about it!
The Blu-Ray disk looks VERY good compared to an old VHS copy I had, and of course it should. But there are no significant dropouts, specks, and other anomalies which would detract from the viewing experience. I have a 61"" plasma TV and got a Sony BluRay player for Christmas, so my setup is fairly average. I don't have a surround sound system, so without being able to comment in too much detail, the audio seems perfectly fine to me.
The picture is not especially sharp, though certainly not soft and/or blurry. In comparison to my Criterion version of ""Fiend Without A Face"" (regular DVD, not Blu-Ray) the Criterion version of ""Fiend..."" appears sharper. This is no criticism of Olive Films' BluRay of ""Colossus..."", however and it may not be a fair comparison. The price seems reasonable to me, and I was pleased to own a good transfer of this (to me) classic sci-fi film.
I did knock off one star for the fact that there are NO (not one!) ""special feature"" on the disc, not even subtitles or the original trailer. Still, I'm proud to own it and I really enjoy it.
I received the 8-movie Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection and the 4-Movie Ray Harryhausen Collection with the player for Christmas and was delighted. I since ordered the Vincent Price ""House Of Wax"" 2D and 3D disk and the ""Colossus Of New York"" disc (all on Blu-Ray) and am enjoying all of them!
Hopefully BluRay will do what the original DVD flurry of releases did and cause studios and manufacturers to release some long-unavailable classics and genre films in this new format. I especially await ""Invasion Of The Saucer Men""!",1391299200,3,2102,4.653225806451613

Unfortunately, you will not have time to complete your experiments . . . .

If you are Jeremy's father, you are proud of your favorite son - he was doing the highest form of duty for all of humanity;  that's why you were so devastated when Jeremy's life ended so abruptly.  As a brilliant brain surgeon, you realized that if you acted quickly, you might save his brain and - just perhaps - the world would not be denied of his genius . . . .

If you are Jeremy's brother, Henry, you were appalled when your father showed you Jeremy's brain, apparently alive, submerged in a box of bubbling fluid.  But that wasn't the worst of it - he wanted you, with your expertise in automation, to build a robot body for it so that Jeremy could continue his work!  With great reluctance, you began to do as he asked . . . .

If you are Jeremy's widow, Anne, you wake up one night to horrifying noises and yelling;  the noises must be coming from the lab!  You hastily descend the stairs to the lab door - all is now quiet.  Henry comes out, assures you that the voices you heard were just his father's ranting about the experiment's failure - but most unsettling to you, was that anguished voice sounded like Jeremy's . . . .

DVD - 2011, Olive Films.  Sharpness, contrast, & brightness: good to excellent.  Defects: rare flecking.

It has a flawless picture presented in letterbox format, displaying the full screen image we've all missed when watching it on TV over the last thirty years. This under-rated classic was originally released with  Jack Arnold's The Space Children, which is also now available on Blu-ray after decades of waiting by fans of these movies.  I recommend that sci-fi lovers purchase both movies and treat themselves to a double feature from 1958  a banner year during the Golden Age of cinematic science fiction.",1384560000,,660,4.745614035087719
4513743,4,B00508W2Z8,"That is, Jeremy (Ross Martin) Spensser's brother Henry (John Baragrey) had to be a huge fan of movie monsters because the one he designed, the Colossus of New York, was a composite of the very best.
1) THE GOLEM. Similar in stature and appearance, Colossus is given a shut off valve instead of a star. A child takes care of things in both films.
2) FRANKENSTEIN. Colossus has the big boots and the shambling stride down perfect along with the posture and even the way his arms are dangled about, then lifted for threatening effect. Again, there is a key scene with a child, but Frankenstein's creation gets a little too carried away with his playing.
3) GORT. Size, appearance, check. Colossus also has that look in his eyes that tends to burn people. Again, a little boy wants to be his friend.
4) ROBBY. Size, rampage, little boy again.
...and I'll even throw in for good measure that giant clunker killer robot from Bela's serial,
5)name????...THE PHANTOM CREEPS, who has the size, awkward shambling and good looks to be Colossus' kissin' cousin. The only children in this one are in the audience.

So, if you like this kind of stuff (like me) and don't mind the cheap budget and an occasional laugh, like when Ross Martin darts after his son's model airplane only to be smashed by a delivery truck in a scene that was meant to be both heartfelt and sad but plays more like a GET SMART routine. Or if you're not bothered that Colossus surprises a victim by walking on the bottom of the East River to the intended location within an hour or so when his ponderous movements would most likely take him several days rather than several hours. Or that he can pull off the same under water journey then somehow sneak into the U.N. building to carry out his mayhem. Or even the casual aloofness of the characters concerning the deaths of family members and supposed loved ones. Oh well, such things are insignificant when dealing with a Colossus that is frying dozens of harmless people with laser vision, though in light of today's shocking headlines of constant mass shootings, this finale plays rather grim and somber.

All in all, I really like this movie, a favorite from my childhood, despite some unintentional silliness. It's great 1950s sci-fi fun and director Eugene Lourie is a master of his craft also helming fan favorites BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, THE GIANT BEHEMOTH and GORGO. The Olive dvd is to kill for with a very sharp, crisp widescreen image with exceptional audio as well. And the Van Cleave soundtrack is also outstanding, a haunting piano score that's both different and very memorable for a movie of the 1950s sci-fi genre.",1380585600,,2645,4.698275862068965

4513747,3,B00508W2Z8,"This movie failed to enthrall me on many levels not the least of which was the acting and the idiotic piano score.  At all times, it felt as if I was watching things unfold as some idiot in another room was pounding on his piano.  I couldn't get past that.  I had an overwhelming urge to pound on a wall, screaming, keep it down!  People are trying to watch a movie here!
The story, at least, had some great possibilities, although mostly unrealized.  Ross Martin (playing a Nobel Peace Prize winning genius), fails to look both ways and soon finds himself in his crazy fathers laboratory at the wrong end of a brain removal.  With very little coaxing, his rabidly jealous brother helps implant the genius brain in a low budget cyborg-thingy (at that point he should have wished for another brother with some experience in tailoring!).  No wonder the poor thing was kept under wraps for a year.  Somewhere along the way, the genius brain develops ESP and a knack for staring down his loony father, allowing the herky-jerky monster to wander thither and yon.  I will admit some of the images of this Frankenstein rip-off are effective.  Unfortunately, very little of the movie deals with any amount of mayhem as claimed.  Two sequences of murderous rage and thats pretty much it.  The rest of the story involves the loony father and his rants, the sleazy brother constantly hitting on his sister-in-law, another stony suitor of same, and the little boy and his new (giant) buddy.  Ponderous is the best term I could apply to this movie.  A lack of thrills and chills makes for a very dull offering.  I didn't mind watching it once.

Colossus of New York is a great example of all those ""atomic"" powered 50's Sci-Fi films that were long on sclock and short on special effects, but for some reason (maybe BECAUSE of Ross Martin) this one works well for me.  I really enjoyed the way Martin portrayed the psychological effect of a human being trapped in a robot body.  The film is only 70 minutes long, but it wastes no time in getting right to the ""You will obey me"" brain power games that killer robots played in the 1950's.

The Blu-ray version of this disc is a little more expensive, but was worth it to me.  The picture and audio are both crystal clear.  For any fan of Sci-Fi this is an outstanding addition to your collection.  I highly recommend it.",1347667200,6,976,4.3535911602209945

4513752,5,B00508W2Z8,"You've heard this so often before - I saw this film as a kid and... Well, so often we get to see these films once and then they seem to disappear, not to be seen or heard of again for years. That is such a shame because this one is deserving of a regular screening.

The usual thing for the period this was made in, the mad scientist has something locked in his lab in the basement, the not very willing assistant telling his girl that something has come up and that they'll have to postpone their date etc. In this instance it's the father of a scientist killed in a road accident who puts his brain into a giant robot and brings him back to life.
First we see the brain connected up to a maze of wires. This scene is unnerving because of its atmospheric quality, the dark basement, the realisation that the brain may be thinking and feeling and living. But when we first see the robot brought to life for the first time, when we see what it sees, a snowy, fuzzy picture of the scientist slowly coming into focus and the tinny voice it hears it gets really creepy. Then, when the robot struggles to speak in a raspy, scraping voice with the electronic buzzing and humming in the background it chills the blood. When it screams in agony the sound it makes is that of a stragulated, tortured soul. There in the shadowy light, its eyes glowing in the dark, it's one of the eeriest scenes I have ever seen. It certainly spooks me. And it all works so well because it's in black and white. This is a film that would not benefit by the use of colour. I've often heard it said that monochrome can be more atmospheric than colour and it's certainly the case in this instance.

I LOVE this sort of science fiction. As I've said about, ""The Earth Dies Screaming,"" the use of old electronics, white noise, snowy interference, humming and buzzing seem to evoke an apprehensive unease. It just seems so alien, so cold, so unnatural. I donno, maybe it's me, but I find it all so CREEPY - in a delightfully delicious way of course.

I had an old VHS copy of this film that I bought on e bay some years ago and, although it was an official release the picture quality was appalling. That copy has now gone in the bin because this DVD released by Olive Films is really very well done. The picture is sharp and clear with good contrast. It looks like it's had a good makeover. Aspect ratio is 1.85:1. There are no extras whatsoever and, sorry to say it IS region one encoded, so, if you don't have a multi region DVD player you won't be able to view it. It's quite a short film at 70 minutes but it is just SOOOO worth it with one of the most realistic movie robots ever.

4513753,3,B00508W2Z8,"In some ways this movie should have been exactly what I expected -- a scary Frankenstein-like theme of a brilliant man's brain trapped inside a metal body. No senses of feeling, taste or smell, relentless longing for his wife and child who don't know he exists and, oh yeah, awareness of his brother's advances toward his wife. A brilliant humanitarian transforming gradually into a dark and vindictive golem -- the very negative of who he was when he was alive. You know - Greek tragedy stuff.

The unusual scenes for when he was first becoming aware, his anguish at still being alive, expressed through a voice that sounds like a screeching cat on a faulty 1920s radio -- that was really well done and very original.

This is a dark and scary version of Tobor The Great, where the grandfatherly scientist has become a mad brain surgeon and the affectionate robot a creature bent on the destruction of the excess population. Worth seeing for it's unusual nature and as a historical artifact. I wasn't crazy about the piano score. If I ever get the urge to see it again, I'll probably pull out my Tobor the Great tape instead :)",1340841600,,1128,4.635

Clocking it at only 70 minutes, the film actually felt too long and ultimately bored the hell out of me. I viewed it twice just to make sure I wasn't missing something - I wasn't. It's just a slow, boring film.

Technically, the picture looks surprisingly good with solid blacks, good contrast and very little artifacts. I very solid visual presentation indeed. Sonically, the sound was uneven and unnatural and I found myself having to raise/lower the volume often. With regards to extras - there are none - not even a single trailer, which begs the question why in the hell is this film priced at 19 dollars??? Honestly, it shouldn't cost more than 5 bucks.

The only thing making me give this film 3 stars instead 2 is because of occasionally interesting camera work and a few legitimately creepy parts.",1323561600,4,930,4.590361445783133

4513760,4,B00508W2Z8,"THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK (1958), is a thoughtful science fiction tale about a Nobel Prize winning scientist (Ross Martin) who is accidently killed, and whose brain is transplanted into a robot by the dead man's father (Otto Kruger) and brother (Robert Hutton). Unable to endure his wretched existence, the mechanical man decides to unleash his frustration upon humanity.

Directed by Eugene Lourie, this exceptional little B-film is just as good, if not better, than most movies of this type, and yet it's not given the attention it deserves. COLOSSUS' strength is in the characterizations, particularly Otto Kruger as the well meaning but ultimately misguided father, Robert Hutton as the envious other son, and Mala Powers as the dead scientist's wife whose worst suspicions are disregarded by everyone.

The robot in this film is pretty ominous, and the later scenes of it walking under the water, then rising up out of it against a backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge has a genuinely eerie atmosphere. It also unexpectedly shoots laser beams from its eyes; this it does quite mercilessly at the climax of the film which takes place in  the United Nations Building. The economical production methods are actually a plus factor in giving COLOSSUS its particular brand of effectiveness. A further addition to the creepiness is a stringent, all piano music score.

Olive Films has released a pristine, widescreeen edition of THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK that's worth picking up. This is one sci-fi gem that you'll be watching again and again.",1320364800,14,1534,5.075396825396825
4513761,4,B00508W2Z8,"The curators at Olive Films have unearthed another rare film release, Director Eugene Lourie's 'THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK'-1958, a film which sometimes gets lost in the shuffle when classic Fifties Sci-Fi films are bantered about among film buffs.  Perhaps its the Frankensteinian theme of the plot or its stagey look reminding one of future 'OUTER LIMITS' episodes with very straight on photography by John F. Warren, however , the film emerges as a very somberly tragic tone poem aided by the mesmerizingly beautiful piano score by Van Cleave and a short appearance by actor Ross Martin who loses his life at the start of the film but haunts the rest of the films running time in the structure of the huge robot.  Martin always was a treat in all of his film appearances which culminated in his role of master of disguise Artemis Gordon who aided agent James West in the classic sixties Television series' THE WILD WILD WEST'.  Aboard for the ride are many familiar faces; Otto Kruger as Martin's selfish scientist father, the beautiful Mala Powers who graced many a genre title and Robert Hutton who graduated to low budget British film forays.  The film is Produced by William Alland who had a hand in many classic Sci-Fi productions for Universal International many directed by Jack Arnold and is also aided by Art Direction by Hal Pereira who worked with Producer George Pal on such films as 'WAR OF THE WORLDS'-1953 and effects work by master John  P. Fulton, the pioneer of Universal Pictures early Thirties Horror classics. The storyline by Thelma Schnee would also be used in a slightly different format by British Writer/Director Brian Clemens for his three episodes involving 'THE CYBERNAUTS' in the classic British series, 'THE AVENGERS'.  Director Lourie , who is known for his giant dinosaur on the loose films, gives the film the right poignancy to his robotic story line which brings to mind sequences from 'THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS'-1953 and 'GORGO'-1961.  Olive Films give the release the proper crisp transfer the film deserves making it look like it was made yesterday.  Highly recommended for lovers of Fifties Sci-Fi and Horror films, the film emerges today as a tragic photoplay showing how selfishness can obliterate all traces of logic no matter how highly educated or good hearted the person may be.",1320105600,2,2330,4.9411764705882355

4513763,5,B00508W2Z8,"As others have already stated in their reviews, this was one of those movies that you could have been lucky enough to see just a few times if you had grown up in the '70s.  With an eerie combination of dark production and musical soundtrack this film has a macabre feel to it that rivals most other popular films of the genre.

Because of actors like Ross Martin and classic laboratory electronic sounds and hums this movie plays out like an extended Twilight Zone episode or a missing Outer Limits episode.

I don't like to go in to traditional descriptions but essentially a famous humanitarian/scientist meets a tragic and untimely death; his father, who is also a scientist, removes his brain and revives it in the robot body of the Colossus.  Like a modern day Frankenstein story the Colossus rejects his outcome and becomes mad as a result of it; he even attempts to destroy his father, and, even though the attempt failed he did manage to kill his own brother.

The Colossus is a very cool looking creature, towering in height with thunderous footsteps.  He shoots rays out of his eyes and has a hypnotic influence on people.  On a humorous note, his cape and stature remind me of Mumar Gadhafi.

Some of the best scenes are of the Colossus walking under water - it kind of reminds me of the Golem in the movie, It, another creepy and unique movie.

The Colossus is gradually becoming the monster that everyone believes him to be and is hell bent on destroying the world but, through the love of his son, his last remnants of humanity seize control of him just long enough to instruct his son to deactivate him.  It is a sad final moment of the movie.

For the past decade I have been typing the title of this movie in Amazon's search engine only to be disappointed that it hadn't yet been released.  I couldn't believe it when it finally showed up - I ordered it immediately.

This movie is an excellent example of Goth before the popularity of the word had been established.  If you are Goth-minded I highly recommend that you watch this movie in candlelight - you won't be disappointed.",1316995200,3,2096,4.554666666666667
