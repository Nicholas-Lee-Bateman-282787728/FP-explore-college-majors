201876,5,1633420922,"This is an excellent resource!  Whether you are newly married, married for a few years, or married for a lifetime, this DVD can change your marriage.  Each section is short enough that you can easily find the time to watch it nightly for a little over a week, or spread it out over a couple months.  There is also a guide you can download to use to follow along while watching the DVD that summarizes each section.

Right from the beginning, Harvey challenges viewers to change the way they view the sin in their partner.  It is super easy to look at your partner and see only the way they sin against you, however, Harvey reminds us that all sin is against God.  It takes away a lot of anger and opens viewers to listen to the lessons that follow.

Some of the stories Harvey shares are sad, some are funny, but I could identify with a lot of them.  Sometimes it is helpful to be reminded that others have walked (or are walking) in the same path we are.  Watching this series with an open heart and mind creates an attitude of thankfulness and contentment, not only in your marriage, but in your whole life.

In my opinion, this DVD series is helpful whether you watch it alone or with your partner.  I think it is great to watch each section separately and then with your partner.  Even if your partner doesn't want to watch it with you, it can still have a positive impact on your marriage, because it reframes expectations.

Whether your marriage is happy, unhappy, energized, or monotonous, this is an awesome resource to improve where you are at.  It can breathe life and hope into your marriage.  I can't wait to read the book!

201877,5,1633420922,"My Review:

 Marriage is a tough road and most of the time you don't get a beginners manual to help figure it all out. It takes tons of time and forgiveness and countless other things just to survive that first year. My husband and I married young and we were not following Christ as we should most of all me. I was a backslid Christian, he never being saved--so  we were sinners in every sense of the word. With that being said I believe the author is meaning saved or not by his title but leaning more towards the fact we are all sinners. Marriage is hard even in the best of circumstances, but couple it with daily pressures and situations and you got a disaster waiting to happen.

 The author has taken the guess work out of a marriage built by God and for His glory. He has done something that my husband and I believe that will be earth shattering and if it can help our marriage it can help anyone's. The author has 8 separate sessions for you and your spouse or it can also be used in a group setting. The sessions include Sin (Parts 1&2), Design, Contentment, Mercy (Parts 1&2), Sex and Stubborn Grace. Dave also explains issues in his own marriage and teaches you how to overcome them in your own. This study will be an eye opener whether your marriage is just beginning or it is well seasoned.

7800749,4,1633420922,"David Harvey is senior pastor of Covenant Fellowship Church (Glen Mills, PA). He has previously written a volume by this same title, When Sinners Say I Do. The premise of this teaching series is solid. Even in the marriages of Gods holy people, we bring our remaining corruption with us into this gospel-mystery union. Sins power has been removed even though its effects remain. Referring to Christians as sinners is commonplace among evangelicals  even though this designation is theologically inaccurate and misleading. Nevertheless, corruption remains and must be taken account of in our marriages. Disagreements arise in Harveys treatment of grace and law but these will not be addressed in this review.

Harvey approaches his topic in eight messages: sin (two parts), design, contentment, mercy (two parts), sex, and grace. There is a logical order to this treatment this side of the fall, though perhaps beginning with design might have better facilitated Harveys goal in this series. Marriage  including its privilege as a gospel-mystery  predates sin. Design is more ultimate than what humanity has done to marriage through rebellion.

Interaction with Malachi 2:14-15 and the covenantal nature of marriage was lacking in this series. While sex is good and pleasing  and children are not its only end  God desires godly offspring from the marriage covenants of his holy people. Perhaps a separate session on children would have been beneficial to Harveys viewers. While parenting made a few appearances, not all marriages are blessed with children. Back-ending a session on parenting, applying the main themes of this series, would have strengthened that aspect  while enabling those without children to choose whether or not to hear another teacher miserably fail to address their particular situation. On the other hand, the nature of this sort of series makes application superficial at best.

The session on contentment is perhaps the most valuable contribution in this series. Contentment is a rare jewel that is too often absent from our lives. Yet discontent is a deadly poison that threatens to choke the life from all those who would privilege its succor over the sweetness of Gospel contentment. Discontent is the product of sin  of some sort  and we run to it for relief, but the only relief is found in the yoke of Christs sovereignty and grace (Ps. 2).

The production quality of this series is good, though messages delivered directly to a camera often lack something that can only be found in a live delivery. Positively, I did not get the feel that the speaker was reading directly from a prompt, even if there was a measure of artificiality  you can imagine that you are speaking to an audience but the effect will always be different from that captured with a present audience.

This teaching series will be useful, perhaps, as an aide to pre-marital counseling, or counseling with new believers who have been married for a time but without Christ. While the theology is mostly on point, those marriages that have weathered the years will find less to benefit.

7800750,4,1633420922,"Marriage is difficult. Placing two sinners in the same living quarters and having them structure their lives around each other can be problematic.  Thankfully, none of this caught God off guard. He planned marriage to be a reflection of the love that His Son has for the Church. A marriage with Christ as the center is what God intends and in the When Sinners Say I Do Video Series with Dave Harvey takes the viewers through 8 sessions to explore what Scripture says in relation to building a healthy marriage.  Drawing from 20 plus years of pastoral experience and 32 years of marriage Harvey is an excellent source for wisdom in how to relate to one another.

Each sessions is around 20 minutes long with some topics covering two sessions.  The session topics are: Sin Part 1, Sin Part 2, Design, Contentment, Mercy Part 1, Mercy Part 2, Sex and Stubborn Grace.  These sessions are Word centered with Harvey working from multiple text throughout the sessions.  The text of Scripture as well as other quotes that Harvey uses are shown on screen with him and show up very nicely on the blue background.  The style of this DVD is simple, but it works well. These sessions have been a blessing to my wife and I so far and I am sure they will continue to be in the future. This would be a great resource for Pastors to use in counseling or small group settings.

One note: In one of the sessions when talking about the prodigal son Harvey paraphrases by saying he spent his money on hookers.  I felt that this was unnecessary and it reminded me of so many younger pastors who feel the need to be crude or shocking to make their point. It didn't fit well with the overall lesson and was not the norm for Harvey in these sessions.

7800751,5,1633420922,"Marriage is under attack today from all sides. Churches are being pressured to recognize marriages between people of the same gender. Our culture insists on divorce on demand. Even in conservative evangelical churches it seems that marriages have never been more unstable. Christians are getting divorced at alarmingly high rates.

Solutions to our dilemma abound. There are countless counseling resources and video series aimed at spicing up your marriage, learning the right love talk, or trying increasingly bizarre sexual practices as a way to keep our marriages vibrant.

Dave Harvey points out what should be obvious. The problem with marriages lasting comes down to one simple point. Marriage always involves 2 people and both of them are sinners! His book When Sinners Say I Do has helped many Christian couples. Now Shepherd Press has released an 8 part video series in an effort to equip the church with Daves important message.

This DVD series showcases Pastor Harvey walking through different passages of Scripture and unpacking the Gospel message that applies to our marriages. He emphasizes that sin is often at the root of relational conflict. He stresses the complementary design of God for man and woman. He preaches contentment and the role of mercy. He talks frankly about sex as Gods gift for each spouse  to be mutually enjoyed. And he points to the power for change: Gods stubborn grace.

The sessions are between 20 and 30 minutes long and focus just on Dave and his message. I appreciate this length as it allows the DVD series to be used both in SS classes and small group settings, or even as a seminar or workshop for a marriage retreat. The shorter time allows for questions and interaction by a local pastor or teacher who leads a group of couples through this material. Included with the video is a link to a .PDF study guide which can accompany the DVD and facilitate group discussion.

The series is appropriate for single adults as well, and they are from time to time addressed. It is also helpful for both older and younger couples  he speaks to the needs of both. In his talk on sex, Harvey is careful to be discreet and yet still direct.

The sessions do not major on the psychology of marriage. More time is devoted to unpacking and applying Gods word and then drawing application to marriage. Harveys advice is seasoned with years of ministry experience. He brings appropriate and helpful illustrations to capture the attention of the audience. And his insights are powerful and helpful. People in a variety of backgrounds and situations in life will benefit from this series.

I cant wait to share this in a group setting  either with our small group or a church SS class. I hope this gains a wide audience and encourages many a couple with Gospel grace for their marriage.

We are all sinners. Sinners sin. Sin hurts people. Hurt people often have difficulty relating to those who hurt them. Even for the redeemed in Christ, sin is a present reality that we fight against.

Dave Harvey, author of When Sinners Say I Do just released a new DVD series of teaching related to the book called When Sinners Say I Do: Discovering the Power of the Gospel for Marriage.

The DVD series consists of eight 22ish-minute sessions dealing with topics of sin, design, contentment, mercy, sex, and stubborn grace. The format is sharp and simple: Dave Harvey stands in front of a black background and teaches. Nothing more is needed because the value of this study is not in flashy graphics or videography, but the truth of Scripture Harvey communicates.

Harvey begins by presenting a theology of marriage and a clear, transformative application of gospel truths. The reason Harvey lays a solid foundation on the doctrine of sin is because, A healthy doctrine of sin will fuel a healthy and appropriate self-evaluation. This evaluation will cause couples to see their behavior for what it is and humble them. Sin is a great equalizer among couples because it shows everyone their need for a Savior. And this is where the transformation of the gospel steps in. Harvey describes it simply, Forgiven sinners forgive sin.

This is a great DVD series for singles, married couples with two weeks or two decades of marriage under their belt because it deals with what is of first importance in life and marriage: the gospel. New couples will learn to set good habits and view their marriage through the lens of the gospel while veteran couples will be strengthened by the grace of God applied toward our marriage relationships. This DVD set is a good alternative to reading the book and allows couples to more easily watch together in a small group and discuss with the free downloadable study guide available from Shepherd Press.

The When Sinners Say I Do DVD series is a great resource to center your marriage on the gospel of Jesus Christ and live in light of its transforming power.

7800753,5,1633420922,"When Sinners Say I Do by Dave Harvey is an eight-session video series covering the topics of Sin, Design, Contentment, Mercy, Sex, and Stubborn Grace. Harvey discusses our sin, how that impacts marriage, and what a Christian marriage should look like. The DVD is based on the book of the same name. I think that its great that this material is available as a DVD; it would work well in a small group setting, or as something that an engaged or married couple could watch together. Additionally, the DVD could be used as part of a premarital counseling course.

I liked that Harveys message was founded on Biblical principles,  and I enjoyed the Scriptures that he referenced throughout the sessions. He is a great speaker, and his message is relevant to young couples today. When approaching marriage, we as humans may be sinners, but we also have Gods mercy and grace, and He can use this to transform our marriages. There are a lot of marriage books and DVDs out there, and many talk about similar things, such as communication, love, and committment. Though this DVD discusses these things, it is rooted in how the power of the Gospel can radically change our marriages, making it a wonderful tool.",1429401600,,1201,4.741626794258373

I am going to talk about what I did not like first, that way we can concentrate on what I did like.  I found all of Dave Harvey's movements very distracting.  I tended to concentrate on his swaying instead of what he was saying.  I would have had more luck listening to this as a CD or MP3.

There were eight very interesting different lectures.  While they were all very different, they had several commons themes, marriage, sin, and mercy.  He also talked about being content.  I thought Harvey did a good job picking the best Bible verses and quotes to go with his discussion.

I would recommend this video to couples who are thinking of getting married or who already are.

7800755,5,1633420922,"Marriage is a beautiful thing. It is where two people become one flesh. It is meant to be a reflection of Christ and the church. But the reality is marriage involves two sinners loving and living with one another in a relationship like no other. How can we navigate, then, how to live in light of this? Thanks to Dave Harvey, those preparing for marriage, those recently married, and those who have been married for years will find wisdom in the When Sinners Say I Do DVD series.

In eight sessions, Dave personally walks us through the power of the gospel for marriage. The first two sessions bring us to an understanding of our sin and that our biggest problem is within us. In session three, he opens our eyes to what Gods design is for marriage. From there, he addresses the issue of contentment in marriage (session 4), the need for mercy (sessions 5-6), the general guide to great sex (session 7), and ends on the note of stubborn grace (session 8).

I am not sure I cannot express how much I recommend to you this resource. Dave Harvey does a God-honoring job of addressing the realities of marriage. He points to Scripture for the foundation of what he is talking about, using both traditional Bible passages for the topic of marriage and others that, at first glance, may not be thought about for marriage. I am thankful for the robust and consistent application of the gospel Harvey makes in addressing marriage. The need for mercy and grace is needed in marriage when we are reminded we are sinners. I so appreciate Harveys emphasis on that! The only critique I would make, and not so much a critique, is the order of the first two topics. I was curious as to why sin (sessions 1-2) was discussed before looking at Gods design for marriage (session 3). Nevertheless, I am very pleased with this resource. If you are looking for a resource that points you to the implications of the gospel in marriage, this DVD series is for you!

Marriage is the topic of the day. Probably even the topic of the last few decades. Unfortunately for the church more time has been spent discussing marriage in the context of a secular culture then within the bounds of Gods covenant framework. Based upon a previously published book with the same title, When Sinners Say I Do presents marriage within a distinctly Christian framework. With strong emphasis on sin, mercy, and stubborn grace Dave Henry builds up from Christian truth to marriage application.

When Sinners Say I Do shines for its clarity. The stories and anecdotal experiences are minimized, imbuing greater impact upon inclusion. Harveys exposition of scripture is primary to each session and orderly. Aesthetically, the filmography is superior to many modern study materials. The Scripture shows up on the screen for readings without distracting.

Harvey is an engaging speaker, communicating genuine care and concern while emphasizing how these fundamental Christian principals exist within the paradigm of marriage. This focus on basics is an asset but also occasionally a disappointment. In developing the presence and importance of applying Christianitys main themes to marriage, no time was permitted to consider more specific aspects of life together. Child-rearing, financial philosophies, and uniting together in church attendance/service are just a few topics completely ignored. While these can be viewed through the lens of Christ and the Word, in what better forum than a study on Christian marriage could they be addressed? The overarching nature of When Sinners Say I Do lacked room to consider particular aspects of marriage that could use a Christian focus.

Joshua: I appreciated the general ground up approach in When Sinners Say I Do. However, I think this indicative of our present churches and their lack of Biblical fundamentals. I imagine that more developed and healthy churches (and marriages) will find most of the series as a review of lessons learned. Presenting a Reformed Baptist perspective Harvey is strong on the sovereignty of God. Nonetheless, churches with covenantal convictions may not be satisfied with the lack of covenant language presiding throughout the lectures.

Alaina: Believable, relatable, and supported by scripture, Dave Henry does a phenomenal job teaching and training others through a sacrament in which he is also participating. In each session a question, conviction, or encouragement led to discussion with Joshua, sparking further interest in defining and developing the necessary Christ-centric answers.

In conclusion, When Sinners Say I Do is replete with Scripture and well presented. Though short, the video series highlights the fundamentals of marriage from a Christian perspective within a structure that adapts itself for Sunday School, bible studies, and personal study.

7800758,5,1633420922,"What is the essence of marriage? What should a Christian marriage look like, and how should it differ from a worldly, secular marriage? What are the purposes of marriage? And how do two Christians enter into this covenant relationship with their eyes wide open to the many struggles and conflicts that will arise?

These are all very important questions, and very likely questions that you will look at and discuss with the pastor who will be marrying you and going through pre-marital counseling with you. One resource that has been very popular, and quite helpful, is a book by Dave Harvey called When Sinners Say I Do. In this book, Harvey does a great job at answering all of these questions in the context of the Gospel, and identifying how the Gospel should impact and transform the Christians view of the marriage relationship.

Well heres some great news  theres now a new DVD study to go along with this excellent book:

In this DVD study, Dave Harvey draws on over 30 years of marriage, and almost 30 years of pastoral experience, in 8 sessions averaging around 20-minutes each. The content of the sessions are as follows:

Sin  Part 1
Sin  Part 2
Design
Contentment
Mercy  Part 1
Mercy  Part 2
Sex
Stubborn Grace

If you are a pastor or ministry leader of any kind, I would greatly encourage you to get a copy of this DVD study. It would be a great resource for you to have, as a church, for those couples coming for premarital counseling. Even if you are not a ministry leader, this DVD study would be great for any married couple wanting to refocus their marriage around Gospel truths, or any single person wanting to prepare themselves for what marriage is supposed to look like when (or if) they come to that.

Also, Shepherds Press is partnering with Vimeo On-Demand to make it possible for you to rent these videos for a 3-month period if you would rather go that route instead of purchasing the DVD.",1429142400,,1917,4.608823529411764
