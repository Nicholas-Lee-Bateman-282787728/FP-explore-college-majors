4962631,4,B006797DYE,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes into the picture. While the first season had a few wrinkles to iron out, ""Psych - The Complete First Five Seasons"" does a good job blending comedy and mystery until you can't even see the seams anymore.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant by his strict father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. Though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police. Even if he only sees them on TV.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. Along with his reluctant pal Gus (Dul Hill), Shawn is regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundson).

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. While there is the occasional serious moment (""An Evening with Mr. Yang""), there's lots of comedy (""That is an anti-tank weapon, and you're pointing it at yourself""), usually involving some unusual plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage).

Each episode is a well-done little mystery, usually with some solid whodunnit material, dozens of pop culture references (from James Bond to wikipedia). Not to mention the hilarious dialogue (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness (Shawn's pseudo-mystical ""episodes"") that keeps it from ever being dull -- mostly supplied by Shawn, but everybody gets some fun time. Gotta love that.

There is a slight flaw, though -- in the first season, a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as time goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out. Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble.

On the official side of the cast fence, we have the crusty, hard-nosed Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson (""an enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle"") to round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow but privately indulges in spray-tans and radioactive shirts.

""Psych - The Complete First Five Seasons"" is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a show to keep on your watch list.",1362355200,2,3137,5.019230769230769
