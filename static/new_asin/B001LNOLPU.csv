3688271,5,B001LNOLPU,"Before anyone asks, I was able to get THE WITCHMAKER early from a store that doesn't necessarily stick to release dates. I wanted to make sure folks know that this release from Code Red is the ONLY FULLY AUTHORIZED release with producer LQ Jones' involvement. The image quality very ably betters the old Midnight Video release in every way since it is a new HD transfer from elements provided by Jones (significantly better colors and detail, anamorphic, many fewer scratches). It also features an 18+ minute conversation with LQ Jones and a commentary track with LQ and cinematographer John Morrill. OAR is 2.35:1. I have posted some screen caps at a few cult movie forums, just do a search online.

THE WITCHMAKER (aka Legend Of Witch Hollow) is a great movie that follows Alvy Moore, Thordis Brandt, Anthony Eisley and others investigating mysterious murders in the swamp. They come up against Luther The Beserk, creepily played by John Lodge, and his minions from the other side. Directed by William O. Brown and produced by Jones and Moore, this movie makes for a great double-feature with their other horror movie, BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN. As the catch phrase for the movie says... Was Death Only The Beginning?",1308960000,13,1214,4.921951219512195
3688272,2,B001LNOLPU,"I won't go into great detail about the movie itself except to say it's a very low budget effort from 1969. Many might be familiar with it from showings on TV throughout the 1970s. For those who are interested, the Sinister ""special edition"" is a DVD-R of a VHS tape, itself sourced from a very mediocre print. The 2nd disc is a ""scope"" version of the same. Extras include one trailer. So if you want it, this is the only ""DVD"" option as of this writing. It would be great if this could get a better quality release as the film is not without its charm and features earnest performances from most of the cast (little known John Lodge in particular) but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to happen.",1249171200,12,705,4.348484848484849

3688289,4,B001LNOLPU,"I remember this movie from my teens. It scared me enough that I remember it to this day. Particularly the ending which for me left an option that the garlic had not done its job and the threat remained (can't say more without spoiling the end). I had seen a copy before but it was STD and not very sharp. This is a great edition in wide screen HD and very clear. I viewed on Prime stream so not sure about physical media quality.

As for the movie itself, it is I think entertaining, skirted on being risque (for that time) and well acted. There are several familiar faces from TV shows. I would say if you watched this movie you might at least be looking over your shoulder if you found yourself in the middle of the bayou late at night.",1482019200,7,738,4.197183098591549

3688295,5,B001LNOLPU,"First of all, I just thought of this movie after going over a list of movies to buy,I love the oldies.
Only problem was, I could only remember I saw this on Elvira's movie macabre, back in the 80's. You know,you're half asleep and something comes on t.v. and wakes you up cause it's so weird?, this was probably the only movie I didn't want to hear Elvira make wise-cracks and corny jokes. I went through the list of Elvira movies here on Amazon and nothing rang a bell ,then it came to me the guy from Green acres!! Alvey Moore is in this movie!. I'm NOT, repeat NOT a fan of horror, however this is something that is so different and really was well acted for the most part, it was scary somewhat  and some of the sex/orgy type scenes should be viewed by people at least 16-17 I think.  I mean kids now days have seen and heard a lot, except this is at times pretty heavy, lots of near nude curvy young ladies ,one being whipped, AND AS I RECALL HARD!  s&m and lust and carnality are rampant I'm serious,  just a very suggestive movie, it doesn't take much imagination to see that anything goes in this horror film. I liked watching Luther the warlock, running around throwing fireballs (I guess that's what they were??!!) and yelling JEEEEESSSIE Jessie was his main witch girlfriend  who was an old crone one moment and  beautiful the next. If you're into Witches, Warlocks, Horror and hot(implied) sex scenes, this one is worth adding to your collection. This movie isn't like anything you've seen before, for some this will be a good thing, for others not so much,  it is, what it is and depends on your taste.",1396310400,3,1615,4.417508417508418
3688296,2,B001LNOLPU,"History of THE WITCHMAKER initial marketing and premiere in 1969.

""The Witchmaker"" (1969) was a low budget horror movie released in the summer of 1969, which made a lot of money in drive in theaters in the Los Angeles, California area, following it's heavily promoted world premiere at the Acres Drive In located in Phoenix, Arizona.

Here's the background story of my connection with THE WITCHMAKER (1969 Excelsior Films) starring Alvy Moore, Thordis Brandt, Anthony Eisley, and John Lodge (also Susan Bernard).

I'm currently a movie actor, but didn't start paid, full time movie actor work until 1970 in Hollywood.

Before that, I worked two years as a regional movie publicist for a SF CA USA based regional ad/PR agency which specialized in local (SF Bay area) movie publicity, primarily for Warner Bros., but also for other studios, large and small.

United Artists Theatre Chain of SF CA showed a lot of ""Indy"" movies (along w/Hollywood studio movies) in movie houses and drive in theaters the chain owned.

THE WITCHMAKER (1969) was aimed at drive in theaters, which did big biz w/teen agers in parked cars necking quite a bit, and not paying attention to the quality of the movie.

It was created from the partnership of LQ Jones and Alvy Moore, both character actors of long experience and high standing in Hollywood for 20 years before THE WITCHMAKER (1969) was made and released.

The movie was shot in Louisiana in 3 weeks, featured Ms. Thordis Brandt, who was a famous beauty queen of the times who had appeared in FUNNY GIRL (1968) starring Barbra Streisand...Brandt was a Ziegfeld Follies beauty (in contrast to ugly Steisand, which was the joke of the movie.....Fanny Brice/ Streisand made more money, got more famous than the beauties who worked as Ziegfeld beauty queen girls).

Brandt was no actress. She was a model for still photos.

She ran through the jungles of Louisiana bare breasted, but cupping her tits with her hands. THAT was the big sex scene in the show. Keep in mind porn had just become legal, and the Sex Revolution of the 1960's was in high gear.....subject of big interest for the public which the major studios didn't get near. Indy movie makers jumped in to make money and did covering the subject, recruiting the likes of Thordis Brandt and other ""witches"" and girls of beauty part of the movie to show off their charms and parts.

Making Indy movies is not an original idea....many get made, most go nowhere, including very good ones with very famous names and big stars...but no distribution.

Jones and Moore got VERY lucky connected with the SF CA USA based United Artists Theatre Circuit....which backed THE WITCHMAKER (1969) ...already finished when the deal was made. MORE movies were funded and made, but never did as well as the THE WITCHMAKER which was tested and promoted and premiered in Phoenix, AZ at the Acres Drive In, and promoted on the local KOOL-TV Gene Autry owned TV station.

I was the main guy in Phoenix AZ flown for a month or so to Phoenix AZ to set up and execute the premiere of THE WITCHMAKER (1969) which eventually included a gathering of all the big shots and actors part of the movie....they appeared on local TV and other local media, and hyped the show.....which did VERY well at the Acres Drive in during the hot summer of 1969 (June or July or so).

I was 25 years old, but quite a big shot publicist and publicity/ PR manager for JackWodell Assoc. Ad and PR Co. at 582 Market St, 19th Floor (which also was the main publicist for the SF CA USA Film Festival, and did non-movie PR on occasion for restaurants such as the IMPERIAL PALACE Restaurant of fame in Chinatown, SF USA).

Jack Wodell Assoc. created the TV ads and previews of coming attraction ads (aka ""Trailers"") and also the radio spot ads and also the newspaper ads for THE WITCHMAKER (also the ""one sheet"" movie posters, which I have a copy of in my kitchen as I type this in 2012 in Columbia PA USA!).

It also placed all the ads for the movie in Southern Calif. where United Artists Theatre Circuit owned maybe 70 drive-ins, ALL of which opened THE WITCHMAKER on the same 1969 weekend, and that resulted in VERY big money for everybody!

Sue Bernard was in the movie, and she was the 25 year old daughter of Bruno Bernard, aka ""Bruno of Hollywood"" who was famous for movie star celebrity portraits. Sue is now a very rich old lady in her late 60's still raking in money because her Dad shot the most famous photo of all of Marilyn Monroe, and left Sue the Copyright.

Sue and I had a lusty affair during her time in Phoenix AZ in 1969 (we were both 25 and the Sex Revolution was alive, well, and going great guns).

Thordis Brandt was past 30, and thus ""too old"" for me! She wanted me, but I thought she was an old lady...she was maybe 31!

Right!

The movie lasted and lasted and lasted. It was turned into a VHS tape in the 1980's which few Indy horror movies of the 1960's were......one can still buy movie posters for the movie on the Internet.

Most of the people part of it are dead or geezer (me and Sue!).

Well.....memories from Tex Allen (birth name David Roger Allen) of THE WITCHMAKER (1969 Excelsior Films) starring Alvy Moore, Anthony Eisely, John Lodge, Thordis Brandt, and Sue Bernard (and others!).

3688297,5,B001LNOLPU,"If you've haven't seen ""The Witch Maker"" then understand this... You are missing out on the best made witch film of them all. This is THE definitive Witch film. Eerie settings incantations beautifully acted and directed, this film has it all. Suspiria is probably the greatest of the witch films but this film is no doubt second greatest. But don't take my word for it, see it for yourself.",1349136000,2,390,4.666666666666667
3688298,4,B001LNOLPU,"This rare late 60s film has finally gotten a legitimate DVD release.  From the very beginning it captures the viewer in its surreal type world much like Argento's SUSPIRIA.  The story is good, and it's well acted and directed. It involves a group, one of which is a psychic, being dropped off by a boat at a secluded shack in a desolate swamp. The old man that drops them off leaves and is supposed to return later, and the only way to leave that place if you don't have a boat is through a scummier part of the swamp. Those people are there to investigate witchcraft murders with the help of the psychic, and they encounter a magical warlock. If you want gore you'll be disappointed because the film isn't a gore flick, and there's no nudity either. If it were released today, it would probably still get an R rating because of some scenes and there's some blood, but the film isn't very explicit. The purpose of the film is to dwell on atmosphere and scenery. This is one of the most atmospheric films of all time. I love the location where they shot this film, and as the film progresses the atmosphere keeps getting better.  Back in the 60s and 70s they knew how to find a real scummy swamp, and the director also makes sure that you get a good look at it; and it's photographed and filmed superbly.  This film is a true example of a midnight movie, so it's best viewed late at night.  However, the film has a couple of problems that made me deduct one star.  The first problem is that it gets kind of talky at times.  Some of the dialogue scenes go on too long and I didn't think this was necessary.  The other problem is the ending.  This is just my opinion but I thought they could've ended this film better, but it's typical of a 60s type exploitation film.  I've noticed that a lot of horror films in the 60s didn't have the best endings. This film is recommended for those who like those really creepy late night flicks.

The quality on the DVD looks great. This is rare film, and this is the best quality I've seen it in. Since this is a film dealing heavily with atmosphere and scenery, it's important to see it in the best quality possible.",1326931200,3,2153,4.330845771144278
3688299,5,B001LNOLPU,"I have the Midnight Video version and this one is superior. The Midnight Video version is watchable, but this one is superior in quality. The print used appears to be a better, less scratchy print, and some work was put into cleaning up the digital version. Highly recommended movie!",1314576000,4,283,4.795918367346939
3688300,4,B001LNOLPU,"The Witchmaker (a.k.a. ""The Legend of Witch Hollow,"" the alternate title that actually appears on-screen here) is one of those movies that horror fans have HEARD about for years, yet relatively few had actually probably seen.  Its legend among witchcraft-themed movies has loomed large, however, and its ""official"" release on DVD is an important event for horror cinema.

[Minor Spoilers ahead] Green Acres' Alvy Moore is the paranormal researcher who stumbles upon murder and supernatural mayhem in bayou country.  It turns out one of his students (the lovely Thordis Brandt) is a descendant of witches.  Their investigation also pits them against a powerful, creepy sorcerer known as Luther the Berserk.

Despite being unavoidably dated, all this is played out with dead seriousness, helping The Witchmaker to rise above its surface camp appeal.  There's plenty of bright red blood and some near-nudity (think a late-sixties Hammer feature) to keep things moving along.  The acting is a bit uneven, but one doesn't generally come to this kind of movie looking for Oscar-caliber performances.  Although years of Green Acres reruns have rendered Moore inseparable from his ""Mr. Kimball"" character, he's really quite good here.  The rituals peformed by Luther and his followers are memorable, and add to the atmosphere of dread that runs through the film.

I haven't seen any of the various bootleg prints of the film that have apparently been around for years, but the transfer by Code Red is quite good.  Some of the colors are a bit saturated, but it's a fairly common look for films of this era.  There's a bit of grain present, especially in the darker scenes, but the overall presentation is impressive. I only played about 20 min. of the commentary track before getting bored, so that's not a selling point for me.  There are a few Code Red trailers for some movies that I'm pretty sure I don't care to see.

I'd recommend this one for all serious horror fans, especially those who enjoy a solid ""B"" movie.",1313193600,13,2012,4.985029940119761
8318933,5,B001LNOLPU,"THE WITCHMAKER (aka: THE LEGEND OF WITCH HOLLOW- 1969) opens w/ a woman wading through a swamp in her underwear. She is attacked and ritually killed, w/ a strange symbol drawn on her abdomen. We soon discover that she was the eighth woman to die in this fashion. Dr. Hayes (Alvy Moore), a psychic researcher, and his team, along w/ a reporter named Victor Gordon (Anthony Eisley), have arrived in the bayou, in order to put their abilities to work. Anastasia / Tasha (Thordis Brandt) is a ""sensitive"", able to feel things w/ her mind. While sunbathing in half of her bikini, she is spied on by the very lunatic that has murdered so many women! Using a hex of some sort, this man sends Tasha running through the woods, clutching her upper extremities. This man, aside from wearing a vest made of old Ford truck floor mats, is a devilish fiend, hailing Satan to beat the band! He's Luther The Berserk (John Lodge), and he wants Tasha to join his coven! Using the black arts, Luther calls in reinforcements, bringing the nefarious old witch, Jessie (Helene Winston) into the picture. Together, they seek to deliver Tasha to their master! Can Tasha resist their eeevil spells? Death and demonic doom ensue. THE WITCHMAKER is one of those great, 60's / early 70's horror films. In spite of some cheeeze, there's a sense of fateful dread that hangs over the whole production. Perfect Halloween viewing!...  P.S.- After watching this movie, one fact is clear.

This isn't to say there weren't any really well done movies of this genre from that bygone era; for instance there was ""Rosemary's Baby"", which is IMHO still a priceless classic.

this flick was dragged out of a trash heap from a third rate film vault; although I can't imagine why anybody would even bother to preserve this tragic relic.  There were even better groundbreaking films made in the 50's. this is not one of them.
