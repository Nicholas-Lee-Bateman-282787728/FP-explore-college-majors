8745923,1,B019REWDMC,"I do not mean to be cruel but this show must have been written by and for morons
It is a case of spiraling stupidity lazy writing inept and inane.
I am unable to Fathom the glowing reviews by some I wanted to like the show truly I did but as I said it is a case of spiraling stupidity in every way.
Where I an actor even a desperate one I would run screaming from this script this is a major disappointment on the heels of so many good shows from Netflix Happy Valley River and many others this is not one of them",1521331200,,513,3.895238095238095

8745925,2,B019REWDMC,"This is one of those shows that spends all its time *talking* about what has happened, what's going to happen, and going over people's feelings and frustrations and memories, instead of things actually happening. I get the point of trying to build up the suspense or creating backstory, but this was too much. Only once, in the very last episode, did we finally get any kind of action. I can't believe I stuck with it that long.",1507248000,,428,4.571428571428571

8745927,2,B019REWDMC,"I have watched the first 3 or 4 episodes, and so far, I am VERY disappointed.  I like Kyle Chandler, , Ben Mendelsohn (Aussie actor), and Linda Cardinelli, but, so far in this series, I don't like any of them that much.

The script is poorly written; it attempts to be mysterious, which is fine, but if you don't care much about the characters, then you don't care much about the mystery and what is being said.

Because the show is not that well done, I find myself noticing other things.  The family runs a hotel-resort, but rarely do we see them actually at work.  They argue about the business, they talk about the business, but I almost never see any single one of them actually participating in the business itself.  You just cannot have a hotel which supports 6 or 7 people, and none of those people actually work.

Like many HBO shows, Netflix, Showtime shows, there is a lot of swearing--Jesus Christ is spoken of all the time, but no one goes to church.  The f-word is found a lot.  Quite frankly, I get tired of shows in which half of their characters swear with most every sentence that they speak.  That is another thing which makes little sense.  You don't go into the hospitality business and spend most of the time swearing...you simply do not behave that way in front of you customers.  Most people, when their lives are consume by a business (and most people with their own business put in 10-16 hours a day), they become so careful not to swear in front of their customers that, most of the time, they rarely swear at all.  You may think that I am being picky here, and maybe I am...but that is because the show bores me so far.

Sometimes, it takes a show a couple episodes to find its footing, for its actors to find their characters.  But, so far, by show 3 or 4, the show has not gotten me hooked yet.

Oh, one more thing.  None of the brothers and sisters look like brothers and sisters.  I know that happens a lot as well; but, you don't notice it as much if the show is good.  You accept it, as you accept a lot of things in a show, if the show itself is good.

I don't think there is an American version of this DVD yet; so be careful if you make the mistake of buying this DVD.  You will need a region-free DVD player.",1504483200,3,2246,4.26241134751773
8745928,5,B019REWDMC,This storyline will soon get you hooked. I have watched it over and over again. It will  truly  make you wonder  what Danny will do next. Great characters.,1483401600,,155,4.464285714285714
