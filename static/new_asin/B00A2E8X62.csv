5375271,2,B00A2E8X62,Never even finished watching.,1420588800,,29,6.5
5375272,2,B00A2E8X62,What the heck was that? I believe it was a very long documentary. I thought I would learn more from it. Some say Enrique is a genius. I was disappointed.,1419811200,3,153,4.133333333333334
5375273,5,B00A2E8X62,"Enrique Enriquez is a true poet within Tarot circles, and this movie captures his style beautifully. It's a pleasurable and insightful viewing and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys Tarot.",1416441600,2,197,5.1875
5375274,5,B00A2E8X62,Nobody I've met before or since has this approach to the Tarot. The film depicts the enthusiasm of shedding dogmas and preconceptions and looking at something old with new eyes.,1406937600,3,177,4.933333333333334
5375275,4,B00A2E8X62,"Enrique's approach is active, unique, and refreshing in many ways. I never much cared for the Marseilles deck before seeing the film, but I ""get it"" now much more than before. He reminds us to let the cards speak for themselves in place and time, and not to get bogged down with memorization. I like that his approach is based in art and motion. He explains how to, essentially, pull on a unique, distinct thread to unravel a story from the tapestry laying before you in the cards. And he does an excellent job with that.

Where he lost me was in kind of ""preaching"" about what the Tarot is and isn't. In breaking from an approach he perceives as limited and rigid, he's created his own limitations and structure. He doesn't subscribe to the esoteric approach, which is fine. I see where he's coming from. I personally think there is an inherent esoteric, occult aspect to the Tarot. Coming from my background in esoteric occultism, the Tarot is loaded with symbolism and meaning that speaks to me on that level. I think Tarot is all of these things; it is a story, a tool, a cipher, and much more. The tarot is multifaceted. His perspective illuminates one facet.

The film is definitely worth watching. It's a fresh approach that I appreciate, even though I don't agree 100%. But it starts the kind of critical dialogue and debate that we need to keep things interesting and moving forward.",1389484800,10,1392,4.608870967741935
5375276,5,B00A2E8X62,"This film can transform your way of looking at the Tarot.

in my opinion, anyone seriously interested in reading the Tarot cards should see it - preferably more than once. Enrique's performance makes the Tarot come alive with his unique creative approach, inspiring you to do the same. his favorite is the classical Tarot de Marseille, but a similar approach can work with any Tarot deck.",1380326400,8,388,4.878787878787879
5375277,5,B00A2E8X62,I highly recommend Enrique Enriquez's Enrique Enriquez-Tarology (film) movie to all lovers of the Marseille Tarot in particular and of poetry in general!,1380153600,4,153,5.695652173913044
5375278,3,B00A2E8X62,"The doc felt more like a cult of personality, who is Enrique, rather than what he was trying to accomplish. He kept talking about looking at the cards but throughout the piece the viewer is never led on any journey or process to understand his point of view except for incidentally. I felt disappointed over all.",1376265600,6,312,4.589285714285714
5375279,5,B00A2E8X62,"I really enjoyed this film.  Enrique considers himself a card reader, but he is really a teacher of awareness.  He reminds us to just look at the cards and let them tell us a story without all the vague, esoteric and occult garbage that is so predominant in today's reading practices.  He shows us how the cards reflect the real world...in color, in texture, in the people we see and meet.  He invites us to really look at our world and be present in the moment.  And, the interviews with many of the authors and artists who are involved in the tarot world were fascinating and added a sense of warmth and respect for the man and his craft.",1370563200,12,640,4.34453781512605
5375280,5,B00A2E8X62,An in-depth look at one of the most original thinking Tarot poets reading the cards today. A unique film and thought-provoking portrait.,1355443200,8,136,5.2272727272727275
8546145,5,B00A2E8X62,"Enrique's technique is very enlightening. I learned a great deal from watching this video. There's so much information that I plan to watch it several times. I highly recommend this video, especially to one who wants to learn to read the Tarot de Marseille. I often shied away from TdM decks, but this video gave me the confidence to dive right in!",1528848000,,348,4.629032258064516
8546146,5,B00A2E8X62,"New and interesting ideas about tarot that I wasn't always sure that I agreed with, but loved having my thinking turned around and upside down. Loved this!",1528761600,,155,4.777777777777778
8546147,5,B00A2E8X62,"What a wonderful and atypical documentary on this subject.  Told from the perspective of art culture rather than occult or mystical culture, the central thesis of this documentary is simply this: tarot cards tell stories.  This is not about the occult, or predicting the future, or psychic phenomena.  It is, rather, a pictorial approach to the storytelling our species has utilized for insight and wisdom for centuries.

Especially recommended to skeptics.",1526774400,,457,5.394366197183099
8546148,1,B00A2E8X62,"I did not care for his tone. His ideas are not breakthrough. If you have been reading Tarot, you know every thing or circumstance has a place in the Tarot. Not new. I learned nothing. And I too saw  words and switched it to  swords or viceversa. That doesnt make me a genius that just makes me someone who likes to play with words. Ugh.",1522972800,,336,4.153846153846154
8546149,2,B00A2E8X62,"If this movie had a different title I might have liked it a lot.  The title suggests a film about the tarot.  Its actually a film about the man who made the film, Enrique, who reads tarot. It seemed to me more like a commercial for Enrique than a balanced introduction or exploration of tarot.",1494115200,3,293,4.3090909090909095
8546150,5,B00A2E8X62,"Loved how Enrique correlated tarot to poetry and art. If you can see the poetry and artistic motifs in any given city, you can read tarot. Fascinating.",1474156800,4,151,4.62962962962963
8546151,3,B00A2E8X62,"It was a well made documentary on one man's opinion of which I don't subscribe.  However, I did appreciate his view of the Tarot and many people interviewed helped keep the documentary balanced.",1439683200,,194,4.878787878787879
8546152,5,B00A2E8X62,A bit whimsy. A bit biography. A bit esoteric. A bit nonsense. A spectacular example of a film essay.,1433116800,3,101,4.368421052631579
8546153,1,B00A2E8X62,"Perhaps this guy, Enrique Enriquez, is some sort of big shot for experienced Tarot aficionados.  However and if indeed this was the case, then the title of this video should have been something like ""Enriquez insight into the Tarot"", but not Tarology.  His name would have carried the video to those who are truly interested in his work. The ""Tarology"" title is at its best, misleading.  In the worst, a misrepresentation.  Really a case of self-serving bias.  I just started learning the Tarot, so if you're a newbie like myself go elsewhere for information and/or lessons.  This video will contribute little or nothing to your understanding.",1422144000,3,643,5.018867924528302
8546154,5,B00A2E8X62,"I am brand new. Had a rushed chance reading, and got hooked on the idea. Lots of research, then I found this wonderful film. It let me just relax a bit and look at the cards. I am using The Rider deck, but I think I will check out his! Fun film, great humor, and yes, a little bit of cult of personality! Hard to resist.",1421884800,3,320,3.8636363636363638
