7849457,4,6303525172,"The reviewer by the name of Lyndall gives a 5-star on this but I think it is more on the 4-star side.(4 and a half, really). This is a VERY short  tape. I wanted a bit more for the money. Certain bits are trully hillarious  (the 'Rockefeller sketch' was the BEST)but still not a 'fiver'. OK! it is a  fiver for an American, as he/she will BETTER relate to the jokes.",966470400,11,366,4.126760563380282
7849458,5,6303525172,"This is the very best and funniest video that a Benny Hill fan will find.  I saw it when it first came out and almost died with laughter.  Was delighted to see it for sale here at Amazon.com. Couldn't believe my good  luck at finding it!  If you are a Benny Hill fan, this is a must for  your collection.",945561600,10,304,4.0
