I will find another way.",1355443200,,181,4.6875
8277508,5,B001AHJZVM,"I Titled this ""Needle in the Haystack"", because this is the most appropriate title for this product as far as fitness videos go for losing fat and changing your body's composition.  This DVD provides the viewer with the science behind getting lean, whereas most fitness dvd's don't attempt to go into depth about this.  Ross explains the best time to exercise, he also discusses HIIT(High Intensity Interval Training), the benefits of lifting weights, nutrition, and tips on recovery while doing it with some humor.  This video is a gem, and the fitness world should start using this approach toward educating consumers.",1354060800,,620,5.118811881188119
8277509,5,B001AHJZVM,"I own just about every ab/fitness dvd out there and saw this one and decided to purchase it. It's a great dvd! The presenter is really likeable, which makes the DVD much more entertaining as well as informative. It's full of exercises and workouts along with a full section on Diet too, which is pretty rare for a DVD, it's usually a workout and that's it. If you want to get lean, shape up your abs and build some lean muscle I would certainly recommend investing in this DVD, it will be money well spent. Highly Recommended.",1213401600,7,526,4.43298969072165
