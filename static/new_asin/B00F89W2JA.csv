5970170,5,B00F89W2JA,"Two great movies that the kids enjoy.  It plays fine in the XBOX.  Monsters Inc. is just as it was in the theaters.  However, Monsters University is different in many ways to the original.  It suppose it is because this is the EURO version.  If you watch ""On Demand"" or an US copy, you will find many differences. It becomes a game for the kids.  We have seen the original so many times, we began noticing all of the changes.",1487635200,5,425,4.25

5970196,5,B00F89W2JA,"I was a little nervous because these movies were a UK Import. But it said ""region free"" so I decided to go for it. The movies play just fine in our blu ray player! The only thing that made it seem different than a US version was the language option when I first inserted the disc. Glad I was essentially able to get 2 movies for the price of 1. Not sure if it makes a difference, but the seller was Mega Hit Records.",1452816000,9,416,3.9642857142857144

5970205,3,B00F89W2JA,"The reason I rate this three stars is due to the fact that I received the UK version.

I wouldn't really care normally, but I'm irritated that there is no mention in the product description that this is the UK version.",1435449600,3,311,4.288135593220339
5970206,1,B00F89W2JA,I have never heard of dvd's only working in certain Regions. I couldn't return it and get a refund because I took the wrapper off to watch it AND I couldn't because it is for a different region than I am in. Be aware when purchasing a dvd's for your grandchildren OR children! Do not order from the UK when in USA.,1433808000,8,314,4.080645161290323

5970221,4,B00F89W2JA,"Excellent pairing.  Had the original Monsters Inc., which looked great on standard DVD, but you knew on Blu-ray it was going be even far better.  With the inclusion of Monsters University it was an easy choice to get the set.  I was pleasantly surprised on how good Monsters U was.  Wasn't expecting much from Monsters U (Disney's sequels are almost universally a poor rehash of the original characters with a weak plot), but Monsters U stands well enough on its own to be a good movie even if Monsters Inc was never produced.  My 5 year old daughter loves Monsters U, and I did as well.",1418083200,3,587,4.5
