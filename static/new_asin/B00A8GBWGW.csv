5399588,5,B00A8GBWGW,"I just got to see this movie last night after pre-ordering it and absolutely love it.

It's very much not a typical romantic comedy which is probably why I like it so much. It states some things bluntly that most people will not want to admit are true, yet we all know they are.

All the cast did a great job; Ross McCall and Paul Alessi were very convincing as brothers with the outwardly macho attitude with each other, but there's the little things they each do that shows their brotherly love.

I also loved Danielle Nicolet and Omar Gooding. Their portrayal of a married couple going through a rocky bit was so well done that I was actually talking to the screen hoping they'd hear me and stop fighting.

Paul did an amazing job as the older brother coaching his younger brother on how to 'properly date women'. His character, Kyle, was definitely the stand out and my favorite; with Amie Barsky's character of Patricia a close second because of her strength and great way of speaking her mind.

This is one of the most honest and real romantic comedies that I've seen and I only have a few in my collection. I'm proud to say this has passed the test and I'm so glad this finally became available.",1360800000,2,1202,4.445454545454545
5399589,5,B00A8GBWGW,"I saw an early screening of this movie and was seriously shocked and delighted by how funny it was. While it may not have the media push of bigger studio films, it is funnier than most of the famous rom-coms out there.",1359936000,,218,4.214285714285714
5399590,5,B00A8GBWGW,"Alpha Males Experiement (aka Knuckle Draggers) is the perfect film to watch with a group of people. The ensemble cast presents a range of characters where a connection can be made with one or more of the situations presented. The story is a relationship roller coaster ride with funny highs and dramatic lows.

The opening credits begin with a series of neat caveman drawings with music that set the tone of the story. You'll feel like a voyeur peeking into each character's scenario. Starting with Kyle (Paul J Alessi) who is able to take control of a bar scene injustice that many guys wish they could do in real life. Next is the view of Kyle's brother, Ethan (Ross McCall), who has problems with his fianc and ends up being dumped. As Ethan struggles to find out what he can do to get back together with his ex-fianc, his brother Kyle solicits advice to help him get over her and move forward with a chance at a better relationship with someone new. Things don't work as planned and Ethan's friend, Patricia (Amie Barsky) submits advice of her own, which conflicts with Kyle's guidance causing friction between them. A telling scene of this can be found when the three of them are at Ethan's home getting him ready for a date and there is a showdown with a comparison of films representing the views of men and women.

Just as the saying, ""It takes a village to raise a child"" pertains to parenting; people may need help with relationship problems from many people: family and friends. This is the case with this film, where different characters of the ensemble cast are in different stages from being single, married, or divorced. No matter what stage, there are problems that pop up, and the main key ingredients that seem to help solve issues, are communication and confidence.

I watched this movie with a group of family members that ranged in age and everyone simply loved it... each mentioned different funny things that stuck out as memorable scenes. This is a film geared towards guys and girls alike who can determine for themselves whether we have evolved from caveman times.

An awesome cast made this movie happen, and you can feel the chemistry between them that makes this story work. I've seen some of the excellent film work by Ross McCall, Paul J. Alessi, and Amie Barsky in the past. I haven't seen the other cast (Omar Gooding, Justin Baldoni, Danielle Nicolet, Brandon Olive, Serah D'Laine, or Jennifer Alden) before this, but I loved the job they did making their characters believable and I'll watch for their future projects. I'm also looking forward to more films by the Alpha Male Experiment writer, director Alex Ranarivelo. (I also posted on my MovieVine.com)",1359417600,2,2691,4.755888650963597
5399591,4,B00A8GBWGW,"This is a great cast, well shot, and I totally get it.  Being from Brooklyn, I love Paul Alessi's character, because no matter how much of a chauvinist he seems to be, he's a great brother and only wears that mask to hide his true vulnerability.  Women and men will get this modern day Rom Com.",1359417600,2,294,4.232142857142857
5399592,5,B00A8GBWGW,"I think Paul J Alessi is one of the best up and coming actor, film maker and producers of this century. I have followed his career six years and have been amazed at his accomplishments. Make sure you reserve a copy of this new release.",1359331200,2,235,4.2444444444444445
8548182,5,B00A8GBWGW,"Alpha Males Project was one of the best ""chick flick"" movies I have seen in a long time.  it was realistic but with a twist of humor.  I loved this movie from start to finish. There were sad moments, happy moments, moments that made you cringe but you just keep wanting more.  Huge shout out to the cast for such a great film. ",1459209600,,327,4.142857142857143
8548183,4,B00A8GBWGW,"Alpha Males Experiment takes a look at the well-visited topic of relationships between men and women.

Is it possible for someone to like a guy who is misogynist? Typically I would say an emphatic NO!

Kyle (Paul J Alessi) very freely shares his harsh views on women with everyone that is around. We are eventually given insight into Kyles past that gives us a better understanding of his abrasive character and why his animosity intensified towards women.

Ethan (Ross McCall), and easily likable character, has a passion to become a director. Ethan takes odd jobs, which he quickly gives up if a chance to forward his directing career comes along.

Upset that she is not secure like her former sorority sisters, Ethans fianc Heather (Jennifer Alden) dumps him and takes almost all their belongings from their apartment. Desperate to get her back Ethan begs his brother Kyle for help.

Getting back into the singles scene does not go smoothly for Ethan as he faces his own dating awkwardness and the conflicting advice from his friend Patricia (Amie Barsky) and Kyle.

Along for the journey is a host of other contributing friends and sleazy characters too. Russell (Omar Gooding) and Renee (Danielle Nicolet) are a married couple who bring in a different perspective to relationships between men and women. Justin Baldoni plays Gavin; Patricias rock star wannabe boy friend. We see how Gavin and Patricias relationship unfolds and plays into Kyle and Ethans story.

Renee remarks to Ethan in one scene that he deserves better, and I agree with her. Ethans problem is that he does not want to realize that moving on from Heather would be the best thing for him.

Though the movie's premise is not a new one, writer Alex Ranarivelo manages to keep the story engaging enough to watch through to the end of the film.

Credit also goes to all the actors for making the movie; the cast looked comfortable in their roles and worked well together which adds to the believability of their relationships with each other.

There are a balanced number of moments that make both men and women of our species look less than stellar, which gives the movie the realism that other films in this genre frequently lack.

Kudos to Alpha Males composer Austin Wintory on a job well done; considering it is an Independent film I was not expecting the music to blend in to the story and background as succinctly as it did.",1367366400,,2401,4.789346246973365
8548184,4,B00A8GBWGW,"Alpha Males Experiment is a unique romantic comedy that approaches things from the male point-of-view.

The story follows Ethan, an aspiring director who gets dumped by his hot fiancee because he couldn't provide her with the plush, stable life that her sorority friends were living. Desperate to get her back, he seeks help from his misogynist older brother Kyle, who gives Ethan a crash course on women and dating.

Disgusted by his brother's harsh views on how to treat women, Ethan ignores his advice and ventures out into the dating world, but he slowly realizes that everything Kyle says seems to be true.

Alpha Males Experiment is a mixture of Jon Favreau's Swingers, Edward Burns' The Brothers McMullen, and VH1's The Pickup Artist. The result is a thought provoking movie that examines what modern couples want versus what they need, and how their needs haven't evolved much from those of our caveman ancestors.

I really enjoyed Alpha Males Experiment, and I highly recommend checking this movie out!",1367280000,,1011,5.0359281437125745
8548185,5,B00A8GBWGW,"Great little story.  The writing was meaningful and nicely paced. Alessi did a great job with his character - definitely some layers there that were organically revealed throughout the film - really nice work, Paul. All around good film - not your typical Rom-Com. great work, everyone. I enjoyed it.",1366416000,,300,5.0
8548186,5,B00A8GBWGW,"I rate my movies on ""Pass,"" ""Rent,"" ""See it in Theaters,"" ""Buy,"" or in this case (joining the ranks of ""Swingers"" and ""Marty"") - ""Buy Multiple."" It's very entertaining while also giving you something to chew on afterwards. A great flick.",1366416000,,237,4.804878048780488
8548187,5,B00A8GBWGW,"ALPHA MALES lives up to the same standards as many favorite and successful romantic comedies like SWINGERS and BROTHERS MCMULLEN.  The acting is superb, the characters entertaining, and there is never a dull moment!  Paul J Alessi shines as a Hollywood star should in a given film and the writer/ director is sure on his way to fame.  I can't wait to see the next film the Producer and Director come out with.  Great job cast and crew!  5 stars for ALPHA MALES!  Highly recommended for your DVD collection.  You'll watch it over and over!",1364860800,,538,4.6

8548189,5,B00A8GBWGW,Well done and thoughtful indie movie. Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed the film and all the discussion it provoked.,1362960000,2,115,4.8
8548190,5,B00A8GBWGW,"I loved it instantly. The comedy styles made me laugh out loud and the more emotional scenes had me teary eyed and sentimental. Alessi and the rest of the amazing cast did a wonderful job in this romantic comedy about one brother who lost his love and another who tries to ""help"" him get over it. Love is found in the most unlikely places and by the most unlikely of characters! You will laugh, you will cry but most of all you will find yourself watching it over and over. Its an instant classic!",1362009600,,497,4.297872340425532
8548191,4,B00A8GBWGW,"I have had the great honor to know the Producers of this film who worked hard to make this film. That said, Paul, Amie, and rest of the crew try to show you how a male typically views the primal aspect of life. Writer/Director Alex Ranarivelo does a great job in showing this. This movie centers around two brothers, who have very different opinions on how to treat a woman. Kyle is the one with wrong idea on woman, but Ethan is to ""heart on sleeve"" kind of guy who got dumed. Watch and you'll see who is right about males",1360800000,,523,4.188118811881188
