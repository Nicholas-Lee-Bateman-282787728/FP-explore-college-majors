8126948,4,B000FUTS8U,"I bought this at the local ""walmart of music equipment"" Guitar Center. I was not dissatisfied. The dvd isn't all that great as previously mentioned, has some cool tips and some cool drills (would recommend Troy Stetina's material for more of this stuff though) but the meat of the material is the book. Why? Because it features most of the common metal modes all compacted in one section, and also most of the shred techniques used by Paul Gilbert, Steve Vai, Jason Becker and others. Also one of the things that is really cool about the book is how it lays out some of its material to make you a more creative player. Your average ""guitar grimoire"" gives you the scales but not how to apply them well to songwriting. This book does. One of the biggest influences I've retained from this material is the section on sweep arpeggios. It gives complete sequences on how sweep arpeggio sections can be orchestrated in a song. I used many of the tips in my own songwriting in my band. So overall, I would recommend this highly.",1218931200,,1022,4.559782608695652
8126949,2,B000FUTS8U,"Big problem with this video:
You cannot pause, fast-forward, or rewind it.
If you miss anything the instructor says, you have to go all the way back to the beginning of that lesson and wait for that part to come around again.
I don't have this problem with any other dvd in my collection.
This is extremely frustrating, and pretty much renders this dvd useless.",1207872000,3,361,4.569230769230769
