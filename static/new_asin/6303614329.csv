695708,2,6303614329,"It's a pity that John Waters' Female Trouble is not available on video at this time so Waters' fans could see it, because that is his best film! Desperate Living is a pretty good film, but the screenplay falls apart in  the middle of the movie. John, I love you, you're a genius, but what  happened?! I do agree that Edith Massey is brilliant, I love every  performance she has given, and Mink Stole, Jean Hill, Mary Vivian Pearce,  and Susan Lowe give shine to their roles. But Liz Renay is not very good at  all! Her character is a throw-away to any true talent she might have had,  like a 1970's Mamie Van Doren. Mink Stole did better in Female Trouble as  Taffy, Jean Hill is one of John's best actresses who disappeared too soon  (look for her in Polyester!), Mary Vivian Pearce has her best acting as  Princess Coo Coo, and Susan Lowe's only recognizable role is as Mole  McHenry, even though she does a hilarious turn as a secretary in Female  Trouble. Wait for Female Trouble's re-release this year to see Mink's best  role ever!!!! This is a must for Waters fans everywhere, but even John and  Mink don't think this is their best work!

696100,5,6303614329,"I first saw DESPERATE LIVING in 1999, having heard about it by word of mouth, and bought a VHS copy to see it for myself.  And I have to say, just like with PINK FLAMINGOS, I've been hooked on it like an exquisite corpse to embalming fluid.

The film opens with Mink Stole as Peggy Gravel, a real piece of work who rants at everyone from the neighbors to even her own children when she catches them ""playing doctor.""  Yeah, right.  She is married to a man named Bosley, who decides to sack their housekeeper Grizelda (the fabulous Jean Hill) prior to meeting his fate - Grizelda crushes the poor sap to death by sitting on him.  This prompts Peggy, who is the definition of selfish, and Grizelda - who, as it turns out, has a crush on her employer/sister in crime - to take it on the lam, encountering a perve po-po (Turkey Joe) who directs them to the kingdom of Mortville.

Mortville is policed by a gang of baby leather daddies - with Channing Wilroy (Channing from PINK FLAMINGOS fame) as the lead dog - and ruled by the ultimate psycho dictator:  Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey), whose primary bone of contention is that her beautiful, but mental daughter Princess Coo-Coo (Mary Vivian Pearce) wants to give up her rights to the throne after falling in love with a nudist garbage man.

Meanwhile, Grizelda and Peggy land on the doorstep of the mega-butch lesbian Mole McHenry (Susan Lowe) and her ultra-femme
girlfriend Muffy St. Jacques (the beautiful burlesque queen Liz Renay).  And they have stories to tell.  Muffy hasn't seen her children since leaving her abusive drunk of a husband, and Mole was a pro-wrestler who got banned after she killed her male opponent in the ring and stomped out his eyeball for good measure.  But prior to Muffy and Mole baring their souls, Grizelda calls Peggy out on her crap, saying, ""Go outside and bitch!  Bitch at the air, bitch at the trees!  But don't you bitch at US!""  And Peggy being Peggy, it goes in one ear and out the other.

The next morning - after Grizelda acts on her feelings for Peggy - it comes out that Coo-Coo has flown the coop and told her mom the Queen where to go.  Prompting the Queen to order, ""I want you morons to FIND her!  And as for that garbage man, I want him SHOT ON SIGHT!""  And considering that the guards are obedient to the point that, every night, one of them, erm, pounds her royal poundcake, that's exactly what happens.  When Coo-Coo and Herbert meet and decide to run off together, the Queen's guards shoot him to death.  And as ""backwards day"" progresses, it turns out that the entire lesbian population of Mortville is ready to go into revolt.

Later, Coo-Coo has sought refuge at Peggy and Grizelda's rental, with Herbert in tow.  She is so heartbroken that she doesn't want to believe he's dead.  Grizelda feels compassion for Coo-Coo, and tells Peggy, ""Don't be so selfish!""  Prompting Peggy to holler for the baby leather daddies to come get Coo-Coo.  And Grizelda dies while trying to protect Coo-Coo, who is taken off to face the consequences of choosing Herbert over the throne.

Mole and Muffy, meanwhile, are in possession of a lottery ticket they took from Grizelda as down payment on their rent.  And the ticket has been a winner, meaning things are about to change for them.  And how.  After claiming their winnings, Mole does more than go shopping:  She has a sex-change because she thinks Muffy wanted a man.  However, it turns out that Muffy was only trying to make her jealous, that ""I liked your organs just the way they were.""  This deepens their bond, even though Mole now complains that she has ""a Barbie doll crotch.""  And that is when the revolution kicks off.  Their friends come in, with a dying Coo-Coo, and explain that Queen Carlotta had Coo-Coo gang-raped by her soldiers and injected with a rabies potion that she intends to spread through the entire population of Mortville.  And the kicker is, Peggy has sold out and is now working for the Queen, having concocted the potion herself.  ""I'm NOT surprised!"" Mole says angrily.  ""That snotty little social-climber!  I KNEW I should've fractured her skull!""  Prompting Coo-Coo to make her last request:  ""Please, help me KILL MY MOTHER!""

The lesbians mobilize and storm the castle, with Muffy as the distraction needed to start taking out the guards.  Then then kill a whole gang of them en masse when they find them playing in the throne room.  The last to go is Channing, leading to the final confrontation.  Coo-Coo bites Mama's leg, and Peggy tries to save her bacon by saying she was a captive in the castle.  To which Mole replies, ""I hope you're ready for you little debutante party in Hell.  'Cause THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING!""  Mole then proceeds to shove the barrel of her pistol up Peggy's backside and pull the trigger, then the new Queen in town - Muffy - makes a royal proclamation of her own:  ""Kiss my ASS!""  At the end, after Mole announces that the Queen is dead, there's a pig-pickin' - actually, a Queen-pickin', as Carlotta has become the main course in a victory feast.

Sorry for spoiling the angle, but it was the best way I could describe this gem of a cult classic.  From Edie the Egg Lady in PINK FLAMINGOS to the abused and cuckolded Francine Fishpaw's former housekeeper and best friend Cuddle in POLYESTER, she is a joy to watch, even as the maniacal Queen Carlotta.  Mary Vivian Pearce, best known as Cotton in PINK FLAMINGOS, does some of her best work as the troubled, lovelorn Coo-Coo; she only wants to be loved, and her mother won't allow it because Coo-Coo is willing to give up the throne to be with the man she loves - and Queen Carlotta resorts to murdering both Herbert the Garbage Man, and ultimately, Coo-Coo when she stands up for herself.

Mink Stole, in her malevolent excellence, out-Connie Marbles herself here.  As the selfish, conniving Peggy, there is not one redeeming quality about her.  A sell-out from the word go.  Jean Hill, however, is a murderer with a conscience.  She does kill Peggy's husband, yes, but she has a good heart.  Otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten killed while trying to protect Coo-Coo.  Susan Lowe, as the lovestruck, jealous Mole, plays a woman who is afraid of losing the woman she loves - so afraid that she has a sex-change in an effect to keep her.  And Liz Renay, as Muffy, is an understanding soul who assures Mole after the self-emasculation that she was only trying to make  her jealous and that she only loves her.

In all, DESPERATE LIVING is right up there, in my opinion, with PINK FLAMINGOS.  A classic in its' trashiness.  My compliments to you, Mr. Waters.",1403827200,,6614,4.6183533447684395
696101,3,6303614329,"DESPERATE LIVING, John Waters' first movie without his muse Divine, is a fitfully entertaining and really bizarre affair that's hard to sit through at times, but still kind of works by sheer force of will. The story (if one can call it that) is about a woman named Peggy (Mink Stole) who has been recently let out of a mental institution. After accidentally killing her husband, she runs away to the (fictional) town of Mortville, a slum which is ruled by a tyrannical queen, Carlotta (Edith Massey). This film serves as kind of an intermediary between his earlier ""trash"" and the more mainstream fare Waters began making in the 80's. The cinematic quality has yet to be cemented, and his actors shout most of their lines as if the audience was deaf, but there still is humor found in some pretty dark and off-the-wall material. Towards the end, there's even some political commentary thrown in about fascism, oppressive government and class warfare. It would seem slightly shoehorned if the movie hadn't taken place in this fictional/alternate universe, but it still gives the film a little depth. As far as acting goes, nobody really gives a ""great"" performance, but they still have fun with the lines they were given to say. Edith Massey was probably the most entertaining out of them all, as a sick ""monarch"" who gets pleasure out of making her subjects miserable, and even torments her own daughter. The camerawork and cinematography isn't too great either, but it was fairly standard for Waters' lower-budget work. The music was fine too, and there's a nice tune that bookends the film. Overall, it's not as great as the collaborations with Divine but it still stands out as one of John Waters' better films before he went more mainstream. For me, it was a little hard to sit through at times but I'm glad that I stuck it out until the end.",1402963200,,1846,4.753894080996885

696199,5,6303614329,"...screams Mink Stole in the opening rant of this delicious double scoop of filth and decadence. And that line sums it up perfectly: this DVD set picks up where ""Pink Flamingos/Female Trouble"" leave off.

""Desperate Living"" was the only movie in John Waters' 70's trash trilogy I had never seen (because it was never available at any local video stores) and I was unsure as to whether he could pull off another camp/trash masterpiece without his ""Elizabeth Taylor"" (I am referring, of course to that wonderfully, hilariously vulgar creature known as Divine). Ten minutes into this disc, and that answer was a definite ""yes!"".

Right from its opening moments, ""Desperate"" has the same sleazy feel as its predecessors, and the lines that come out of Mink Stole's mouth could make up an entire CD of laugh-til-you-drop sound bytes. Sheer brilliance! And the film just gets better as it goes along, when Mink and Jean Hill descend upon Mortville and Susan Lowe and Liz Renay (""I sleep in the room right next to you.....NAAA-keddd!"") enter the picture. Their flashback sequences are among the funniest moments in the movie and the ""dog food"" scene made me laugh out loud--but the ""squish"" scene at the end of the wrestling match almost made me pee my pants, it was so riotously funny!

Mary Vivian Pearce actually gives a somewhat touching performance here, as I felt sorry for Princess Coo Coo once ruthless Edith Massey as Queen Carlotta started putting her wicked plans into action. The lesbian bathroom bit was another memorable sequence (Kudos to Pat Moran for a brief but deliciously creepy turn as the ""bathroom pervert""--and to Van Smith for making her look that way). Susan Lowe as Mole delivered another gut-busting moment as she stood there proudly waving her newly-attached penis (""It never goes soft!!"") but also made me wince as Muffy finished off the last ""stitch"" making Mole scream in agony.

Aside from Princess Coo-Coo's fate at the end, the movie is a real camp classic that, like the rest of Waters' earlier work, definitely improves with repeated viewings. Watch it with friends and you will all be quoting from it for days--""Royal proclomation Number One--Kiss...my...ass!!"".

The commentary on this disc is a little disappointing because Waters' shares the time with cast member Liz Renay who spends way too much time raving about her own body and how much she loves her own boobs, but she can be forgiven because I'm sure this discussion must have brought back plenty of fun memories for her.

696201,5,6303614329,"If Female Trouble (1975) is John Waters` greatest narrative film, then Desperate Living (1977) is his inimitable descent into a surreal, kitsch abyss that few could imagine. Desperate Living is Waters' personal, alternative universe to the parallel world of Busby Berkeley.  Seen today, Berkeley's films are a surreal wet dream, a perverse man's big budget fairy tales.  Waters filmed his perverse anti-fairy tale on a meager budget three years after Female Troubles, although he had substantially more money here than on his previous films. Budget or no, Desperate Living is just as grandiose and epic as anything Berkeley ever produced.

Star Divine was not available due to other commitments so Waters tapped Mink Stole, who more than makes up for the loss (additionally, Waters regular David Lochary died of an overdose shortly before filming).  The film opens with a bang in the form of a brilliant, in-your-face, unhinged preamble from Stole as Peggy, the most delightful sociopath to ever grace the annuls of independent cinema.  Peggy discovers her filthy sodomite whelps playing doctor's office and goes berserk.  To make matter worse, Peggy's bore of a husband, Bosley (George Stover) catches Grizelda, their 400 pound maid (Jean Hill), nipping at the jack so he decides to fire her.  Enough is enough, so Grizelda conks Bosley over the head and then suffocates him by sitting on his face.

Grizelda tells Peggy,  ""I am now your sister in crime, bitch!""  Peggy, avoiding the same fate as Bosley, goes along with her former maid.  The coupling of Peggy and Grizelda is comically deranged, literally climaxing with Grizelda forcing Peggy to give her oral sex as she screams out, `Eat it! Eat it!""

The two are on the run, and Peggy is disturbed by the surrounding beauty of nature: "" You know I hate nature!  Look at those disgusting trees, stealing my oxygen.  Oh, I can't stand this scenery another minute.  All natural forests should be turned into housing developments!  Don't we taxpayers have a voice anymore?""  The two are soon stopped by a copper (scene stealer Turkey Joe) who tells them about a Pleasure Island called Mortville, where every pervert, nudist, and psychopath can feel at home.  He promises to let them go there if they will only give him their panties and a sloppy kiss.  Joe literally salivates on Grizelda's stained panties and writhes in ecstasy as he wishes Grizelda would suck out his eyeballs.  Chore done, Peggy and Grizelda are on their way.

Mortville is , essentially, a cardboard town with psychedelic sets (brilliantly designed by Vincent Peranio) that, for sheer lunacy, could rival and surpass Ed Wood`s sets for Bride of the Monster (1955).

Queen Calotta (Edith Massey) is the matriarchal Nazi dictator of Mortville.  Carlotta's hands are full with her rebellious daughter, Princess Coo-Coo (Mary Vivian Pearce), who wants to get married to a nudist camp garbage man and live the suburban dream.  Carlotta's answer to this dilemma is to kill her would be son-in-law and teach the town a lesson by spreading rabies through Mortville with a batch of rat urine.  Peggy and Carlotta's leather-clad studs are on hand to carry out every whim of the evil Queen.  "" Whip it out"" she orders one of her studs.  ""I like meat and potatoes, I'm going to have to spank you for arousing royalty!"" she screams, before he plows her furrow in her queen-size bed (you have to see it to believe it and I'm not joking).  By comparison, Ming the Merciless is a wimp.  Ming would certainly never have the lack of class to utter lines like, ""Seize her and f__k her.""

Peggy and Grizelda rent an outhouse from two lesbians, Mole and Muffy (Waters regular Susan Lowe and Liz Renay--yes, that Liz Renay, the burlesque queen and gangster).  Lowe and Renay do wonderful turns in their roles.  Lowe's Muffy performs a quickie sex change via rusty scissors and whines, "" now I have a Barbie doll crotch.""  Still, despite Muffy's dead babies and dog food, the film belongs to Massey and Stole and they both seem to be having the time of their lives.

The midnight cult film scene was about to permanently change.  Waters had one more film to go, the similar, but polished Polyester (1981); then, in 1984, Massey would join Lochary, followed by Divine in 1988.  Desperate Living is really the last film in which everything came uniquely together for Waters in what was undoubtedly his era, when he was a powerful and influential visionary who literally took film goers to the edge of their seat (and often sent them running out the door).

696202,4,6303614329,"John Waters began his career making truly filthy and immoral movies (that were all very fun).  Desperate Living is the last of his filthy films as he began to make some more family oriented movies, that while they were very different, they were still pretty good.

696205,5,6303614329,"The first time I saw ""Pink Flamingos,"" something seemed oddly familiar. I later realized it was the ""acting."" The actors delivered their lines with the conviction and subtlety of a Jr. High School play. This element coupled with the cruelly insightful, almost profound nature of what is being said is a trademark of John Waters. It softens the blow somewhat.

""Desperate Living"" still delivers an abundance of Waters' trademark irony in action, but, there's a catch. Two catch's, really. Firstly, there is somewhat convincing acting from several key roles. It might sound like a letdown, but it actually enhances the story. The second aberration is the absence of Waters' workhorse Divine. Proving that he could succeed on his own wit alone, Waters made his funniest film ever.

Fans of ""Flamingos"" might be disappointed by the lack of ""real"" shock material. (Most of it comes via ""special effects"") Those who enjoy the softer approach of Polyester and later may find it a bit much. But for those who tune in for the strength of concepts and quotable one-liners, this is by far the deepest Waters experience out there.

Hard to believe, but the lesbian community at the time attacked the film for it's 'male-sponsored' perspective. It has since been embraced with open arms as a classically hilarious piece that highlights Waters iconic status in the gay and underground community.",1216598400,2,1381,5.048245614035087
696206,3,6303614329,"Desperate Living was made by John Waters before he truly entered the world of mainstream cinema--and it looks it. With sets that look like garbage pulled from the city dump so that they wouldn't have to pay for it, this movie really takes a strong stomach to enjoy--if you enjoy this sort of thing at all. Its real redemption is in the acting of the cast; their script ain't too hot but the actors sure do a fine job acting!

The action starts in the Gravel household. Peggy Gravel has just returned from a psychiatric hospital and her naive husband seems to think it's going to be all right even though she's still crazy like a fox! Bosley Gravel (George Stover), Peggy's husband, wants to give her a medication injection. However, when Peggy fantasizes that Bosley is trying to kill her, their very obese maid Grizelda Brown (Jean Hill) accidentally kills Bosley by sitting on him.

Of course, they know they're in hot water for having murdered Bosley--ands Peggy and Grizelda flee in Peggy's car. After an unusual (ahem) scene in which a cop lets them get away, they know that they can only go to Mortville where murderesses are tolerated without being punished under the law.

And what a dump Mortville is! Full of trash, poor people and ugly shanties, Peggy and Grizelda don't like it. They stay, however, to avoid the law. They soon rent a room from Mole McHenry (Susan Lowe) and her female lover Muffy St. Jacques (Liz Renay). They also discover that Mortville suffers under the reign of wicked Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey), who delights in torturing people, having her citizens killed and making them walk backwards one day or be murdered on the spot.

So where does the plot go from here? Does Mortville work out for Peggy and Grizelda? What if Muffy and Mole want money--lots of money--to give them room and board? Will Muffy or Mole make a pass at either Peggy or Grizelda? Will Queen Carlotta remain unchallenged? Watch the movie and find out!

The DVD has a commentary by John Waters; but that's really it for the DVD extras.

All in all, Desperate Living is a film you're either going to like or dislike. It has tons of filthy lines and scenes that could make a grown man choke with disgust. That's exactly what director John Waters wanted for this movie; so he accomplished his goal. As for me, I didn't think it was worth two bits--except for the acting. That alone redeems the movie to some degree; so I will take off two and one-half stars and give this movie a two and one-half star review.

Hope you enjoy it more than I did!",1191801600,,2546,4.582417582417582
696207,5,6303614329,"After seeing the newest reincarnation of HAIRSPRAY:THE MUSICAL I needed ""desperately"" to return to original roots! Face it....there really is only one John Waters.(As a small child,John and his ""cast of cohorts"" were regulars at our home as they were all friends of my older sister!)

DESPERATE LIVING is supposed to be shocking,ridiculous,gross and in bad taste, and Waters has always had the right stable of stars (grade B and lower!) to pull off his warped visions .What we call ""great actors"" usually cannot play the demented  and depraved characters that Waters writes; but Mink Stole, Edith Massey, Liz Renay and Susan Lowe are soooooo good at spoof films, just as the Christopher Guest clan is for SPINAL TAP et al.

The story is too ridiculous and absurd for me to even recount. Others have already reviewed the ""plot"" to perfection. I laughed...I was grossed out....I winced....and then I remembered what makes John Waters' films so  much fun; they are cheesy at best and loads of fun and require no thought. John's earliest films need to be watched with someone that is ""safe"" and will get his sense of humor. Anyone else will run for the door!

John's earliest works all contain the edgy and perverse. Once you reach HIS HAIRSPRAY, the gross is gone and a different,yet still wild-and-wonderful oddness is still there.

Why 5 stars? It is perfection for the kind of genre film that it is. I compare it with only other films like it. AMADEUS it's not!

Huge Jean Hill replaces Divine in Desperate Living.  She is so fat that she kills a man in the movie just by sitting on him!  The deliciously ugly Edith Massey plays the Queen Carlotta.  She has a stable of young nubile studs to ""service""  her every need, it is quite gross and shocking watching them kiss and fondle all her rolls of suet.

I guess you could call this one Water's lesbian movie.  Yet the ""love scenes"" are incredibly shocking and disturbing!  When Mink Stole makes love to big Jean Hill, it is a sight not easily watchable or easily forgot!  But remember, Desperate Living is John Waters' last Hurrah before he ""sold out"" and began making ""pantywaste"" movies to appease the Hollywood crowd.

So, when you see the name John Waters on the theater marquee, pass by the theater  and buy his REAL movies that he is (in)famous for, and see the Waters that ""we"" grew to love long ago!",1175385600,,1103,4.6
696371,5,6303614329,"""Desperate Living"" was made in between ""Female Trouble"" and ""Polyester"". You can tell from the scenery that it had a higher budget than ""Female Trouble"" and ""Pink Flamingos"", but it's still a low budget film compared to Waters's later movies. The story is about Peggy, an neurotic upper class woman played by Mink Stole, and her lesbian housekeeper, who runs away to Mortville after accidentally killing Peggy's husband. Mortville is a city of social misfits run by the evil Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey).

Peggy is perhaps the most hysterically neurotic character in film history and Mink Stole should have won an Oscar for her performance. Edith Massey also makes one of her funniest performances as Queen Carlotta. For the first time in a Waters movie, there's a semi-famous actress: Liz Renay who plays a supporting part but got first billing. Divine is nowhere to be seen, but the movie manages surprisingly well without her.

Compared to ""Pink Flamingos"", ""Desperate Living"" relies more on story and less on shock value, but as in all Waters movies, its biggest asset is its hilarious characters and dialogue, and its campy acting. Those looking for a ""sophisticated"" movie should look elsewhere, but those who enjoy campy, over-the-top movies should definately give ""Desperate Living"" a try.",1164585600,,1298,5.1469194312796205

and: [catching her kids playing doctor] ""Sodomites! Caught right in a sex orgy! Filthy, dirty, filthy! Is this what they taught you in private school? Nude, nude, nude! You could be pregnant, Beth! And as for you! I never thought you'd rape your own sister! Oh, God! The children are having sex!""

If its your first time viewing the film, you'll have to try and try very hard to sit through it, because eventually it grows on you in a perverse kind of way.

Peggy Gravel (Mink Stole) is loud, obnoxious, self-obsessed and neurotic woman that runs off with her maid, Grizelda Brown (Jean Hill) because they're wanted by the police.  They arrive in the kingdom of Mortville ruled by Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey) as fugitives from justice.

As the film continues, there are many more of the same lines and others which are quite humourous.  One which I used to hear quite often but not really knowing the reference to it was: ""Eat it Peggy, Eat it"".  (You'll do a turn when you reach the scene, if you don't know it already.)

My only complaint is the commentary, something I've always loved about Waters's DVDs.  He gives such great insight into the people and movies.  So why New Line (or Waters - I don't know who was responsible) got Liz Renay, who must've been in her 70's when she did this commentary, to babble nonsensically in the commentary is beyond me.

What you have is Waters talking for a while - then out of nowhere Liz Renay starts talking about how beautiful she is, or some other piece of crap about her life.  Who the hell cares?  Now this might not have been bad if it were John and Liz in the same room talking to each other, but they were seperate recordings.  Irritating.",1106265600,4,831,4.493333333333333

He went a bit more mainstream after that (not to say that I don't like his new stuff... in fact, I dug Pecker and Cecil B. Demented majorly, but his newer stuff are simply ""good movies"", as opposed to ""cult classics"" by destiny.)  - - The best way to describe Desperate Living (and I believe these are Waters' words paraphrased) is ""a fairy tale for adults with the minds of children..."" (well, moreso sick 12-14 year olds.)  the story is as fun and entertaining as it is gross and disgusting...  Getting to see Edith Massey in the roll of the evil queen and villian is also quite hillarious (especially if you've watched all his earlier films...) and getting to see what she does with the castle goons is even funnier... - - in my book however, the two most memorable scenes involve a cross dressing cop as well as a rather amusingly severed ding dong.  Liz Renay, is also hillarious and really into her role... almost too much... in fact, its the sheer exhuberence of the actors in John Waters' films that make the films such a great watch... you can tell that he's definitely the type of guy that could sell you the Brooklyn Bridge (or atleast eat some poop off of it...)  - - All in all, I'd have to say that along with Female Trouble its one of my favorite John Waters films...

696376,4,6303614329,"With DESPERATE LIVING, the demented genius John Waters has come up with a movie almost on a par with his most notorious bad taste classic PINK FLAMINGOS. DESPERATE LIVING is best described as a warped contempory fairy tale with lashings of ketcupy gore (a homage to Herschell Gordon Lewis perhaps?).
Written and Directed by Waters, this stars Mink Stole as Peggy Gravel, a mentally unbalanced suburban housewife drivine to the brink of madness by her amorous children, cruel husband & their alcoholic maid Grizelda Brown (Jean Hill).
However after the chunkily built Grizelda murders Mr. Gravel by sitting on him & squashing him to death; she & Peggy go on the lam, crossing paths with a wacko cop who has a fetish for women's lingerie. He is also a chivalrous romantic who has a strange request to make of Peggy: ""I'd like to stick my whole head in your mouth & let you suck out my eyeballs"". Now there's a pick-up line that's guaranteed to work every time!
After escaping being assaulted by this crazed copper; Peggy & Grizelda wind up seeking refuge in a low rent village/slum called Mortville where they shack up with lesbian wrestler Mole (Susan Lowe) & her vulgar, trashy lover Muffy (Liz Renay); a disturbed individual whose leisure pursuits include driving a meat fork through her hand for fun. But alas their solitude proves to be short-lived, as the corrupt ruler of Mortville, Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey) has sent her guards out to arrest & execute all homosexuals; but  they mistakenly arrest Peggy & Grizelda. Soon the repressed townspeople band together to stage a violent revolt against their revolting dictator & her submissive slave-servants.
As with all Waters early films, you will either find this to be absoutely hilarious or downright depraved. I am of the former mindset. Fans of the director will be delighted with this. No spoilers but the special highlight for me was Mole's botched sex-change operation- utterly repulsive, sick & hilarious. You have to see it to believe it. Highly recommended, but be forewarned: Edith gets her kit off. Aiieee!",1063584000,,2074,4.9426934097421205
696503,4,6303614329,"It's hard for me to believe that there could be John Waters fans who know only his mainstream films. They're pretty good movies, don't get me wrong; but they walk meekly in the shadow cast by his amazing Trash Trio (this, FEMALE TROUBLE & PINK FLAMINGOS). This one is his all-time best, partly because of Divine's absence. Had he been available, he would not only have nabbed the Queen Carlotta role, but become the focus of every viewer's attention as he usually did. (Well, nobody cites FEMALE TROUBLE for the Donald Dasher role, right?) The way DESPERATE LIVING worked out, you finally get a chance to see how good Waters' other Dreamland divas really were. Here, they're VERY good. Fact, DESPERATE features some of the most inspired, OTT female acting ever featured in a movie, ""trash"" or otherwise. It's as if a heroin-addicted George Cukor decided to remake THE WOMEN in a Maryland junkyard.
Mink Stole is unbeLIEVABLE as Peggy Gravel; she seethes with constant neurotic dementia throughout. Her portrayal of misery to the power of ten is less overacting than it is finding the perfect pitch for the role, and settling in on the very spot. The movie-opening running tantrum she spews is one of the funniest things I've ever seen - every third or fourth word is shouted for maniacal emphasis (""The CHILDREN are having SEX!! Beth is PREGNANT!! And I NARROWLY escaped an ASSASSINATION attempt!!"") Brilliant. But she's matched, step for weaving step, by Susan Lowe's unforgettable diesel-dyke Mole and the nonpareil Edith Massey as the evil Queen of the criminal shanty-kingdom, Mortville. (If you've never experienced Edith Massey, nothing I can say could possibly prepare you for her....unique...greatness. Let's just leave it at that, okay?) And that's not to discount the typically outre work by Mary Vivian Pearce - who plays her character as if she'd gotten lost on her way to the set of a Julie Andrews musical - or the CGI effect that is Miss Jean Hill. This assembly of female firepower results in one incredible movie that STILL has the power to make you squirt liquid out your nose in helpless laughter, Farrelly Brothers or no Farrelly Brothers. As a matter of fact, the more Waters' early assaults on good taste have become absorbed into mainstream entertainment, the better and more shocking his films look for it. When DESPERATE LIVING stood alone, one hardly knew what to make of it. Now that every lesser talent in show-biz is trying to finance a swimming pool by imitating the Waters touch, it's easy to see, and appreciate, who the innovator and true original is. When Waters made this movie, he was a pariah with nothing to lose...he knew better, but still didn't care. Thus, there's an intoxicating power and thrift-shop integrity to DESPERATE LIVING that none of the Johnny-come-latelies can approach, now that ""bad taste"" is boxoffice, and safe as milk.
