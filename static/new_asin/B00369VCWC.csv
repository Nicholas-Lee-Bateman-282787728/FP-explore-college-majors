8389724,4,B00369VCWC,"Goethe's ""Werther"" (1774) not only made him an instant celebrity and insured his literary career, it also provoked an entire cult ranging from Werther-themed parties, to numerous suicides by those identifying with Werther's mindset. Moreover, legend has it that Washington slept with a copy of Werther under his pillow at Valley Forge, and Napoleon had it in his saddlebags when crossing the Alps following his successful Italian campaign.

Interestingly, ""Werther"" is perhaps best known today in the form of Massenet's opera (still often performed, and available on video), but it has not been the subject of a dramatic film with perhaps this one exception. Although purists could quibble with aspects of the film's interpretation of Werther's psychosis (dream-like sequences and surreal moments) and with a Charlotte whose style looks perhaps a bit more punk than enlightenment, the overall effect of the film is stunning and captivating. The version available here seems to be the only one accessible to a non-German speaking audience. It allows subtitles in several world languages (including English, Japanese, French and Chinese) and, while the English translations are not entirely accurate to the German, still it is nice to have this title available.",1271376000,3,1259,5.423469387755102
