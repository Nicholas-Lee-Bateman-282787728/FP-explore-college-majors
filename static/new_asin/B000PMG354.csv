8192789,5,B000PMG354,"For the past decade and a half, my patients and students have been after me to either write a book or do a video about cancer.  Those whose families I have helped have been the most persistant. The medical pharmaceutical complex spends a great deal of time and money to prevent the public from learning the researched facts.  They lie and mislead in order to make more money, even at the tremendous risk of shortening lives and destroying the quality of life of cancer patients. This video was produced in order to give facts to those who are interested, so that you may make more informed decisions.  I hope with all my heart and soul that this information gets into enough hands to help those in search of the truth.  As long as we put our faith in those who have been misled by power and money, we cannot get all of the health benefits that we seek.
