8010106,2,B0001CVAL0,"Bummer. This is another classic Hindi film that for some reason Eros has not subtitled the songs, only the dialog. Just like Mother India. Hindi songs are the freaking movie after all! 80% of the plot is always achieved in the melody. Big fail.",1464480000,,244,4.568181818181818
