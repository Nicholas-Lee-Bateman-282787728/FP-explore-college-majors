2611095,5,B000GGSMO4,"`Roar' is a highly entertaining sword and sorcery series made for television which was originally released to the airwaves in '97.  This magical series has finally been released in a boxed set containing the complete 13 episodes, which includes 5 episodes never aired on network television

Synopsis: The year is 400A.D., the place is the British Isles. The Roman Empire rules the Celtic landscape, that is with the exception of a few pagan tribes still offering what little resistance they can. The task to unite the native Celts to battle the invading Roman forces falls to young Prince Conor (Heath Ledger). If Conor is to be successful he must learn to harness the mystical power of his homeland, ""the Roar."" Only then can he truly lead his people and realize his vision of freedom.

`Roar' is beautifully produced and wonderfully scenic throughout. It also has ingeniously combined Celtic mysticism and Druidism with some rather obscure and archaic elements of early Christian mythology. The inclusion of Longinus, the Roman Centurian who pierced the side of Christ with his spear in the role of Queen Dianna's sorcerer is a fascinating addition to the storyline.

Also starring: John Saint Ryan (Fergus), Vera Farmiga (Catlin), Alonzo Greer (Tully), Liza Zane (Queen Dianna) and Sebastian Roche (Longinus).",1161043200,88,1312,5.1745283018867925
2611096,5,B000GGSMO4,"This series is a total delight with no disappointment for me.  Being a fan of medieval and movies about old Roman and Greek times, this one is another welcome addition to my library of ""fun to watch"" series.  The cast was well chosen and each new character seems to add to the series.  The Celtic type music score is no disappointment either.  Even better, so far no ""flying dragons"" or hyped up ideas such as many other series of this type so often have.  Beautiful filmography.  This series plays in good clarity and sound as well has subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing.  This is something often missing even in higher priced series and is very essential for someone over 62 such as myself.  I wish I had to money to buy this set for for many persons on my Christmas list this year.  The main star being Heath Ledger doesn't hurt either.  He is very talented",1158969600,5,868,4.40251572327044
2611097,5,B000GGSMO4,"I am an original fan!  I can remember counting down the days to see the very first episode because as a 10 year old then, I was just in love with the commercials for it, with all the Celtic culture and the use of Christianity!  And then it disappeared...  I know there were protests and petitions to bring it back, but for some reasons, those cries were not heard.  And now, 9 years later, it has come back to us!  I just ordered it and I can't wait to see it again!",1158796800,5,466,4.021739130434782

Heath Ledger was great, and actually, every actor in this show was perfect in their roles. The sets and costumes were amazing, and even the locations they shot in were beautiful. A lot of fans of this short-lived series have waited for years for this to come out on DVD. The time has come.",1158624000,,466,4.367816091954023
2611099,5,B000GGSMO4,"Roar is a wonderful series with a great cast including Heath Ledger, John Saint Ryan, Vera Farmiga, Alonzo Greer, and Sebastian Roch. It was produced by Davd Cassidy and had a great team of writers. What never made any since was why it was cancelled. The casting, directing, and everything about the show was better than most other series at the time. For many years people had to watch their VHS tapes that they had taped of the original airings. There was a cult over it they had forums and web pages and petitions to bring back the show. Apparently it fell on studio execs that had no concept of what people wanted for entertainment. Considering all the great ancient epic movies of late, need I say more? Finally the SciFi channel was smart enough to air it again recently and I guess someone was smart enough to realize they not only had the original fans but a new group as well.

I am happy to see this on DVD. I immediately pre-ordered this series that was far more realistic and dramatic than others that followed. There are a couple things that are fantasy, but so well done you will think them possible. After all there have long been legends of the Spear that killed Christ. To believe the Roman soldier that used that spear was made immortal to suffer is a great story. And that is but one intertwined story that is woven into a tapestry of incredible people and their culture of the past. The acting, production values, sets, and music are all worthy of movie quality. If you enjoy dramas about ancient times you will want this set about the Celts enduring the rule of the Romans until the time for them to throw off their oppressor. So many stories of what life was like and the blossoming of Christianity in this rugged land with people living in Celtic tribes. I just can't say enough about how well crafted this series was and I sincerely believe everyone should give it a chance. My only negative comment is they cut some of the beautiful music from the original airings and a few scenes. I'm not sure why, but this set would have been better if they had left the music and scenes as they were.",1158019200,56,2113,4.459948320413437
2611100,5,B000GGSMO4,"Long ago, at the edge of the known world, the last Celtic tribes were fighting for survival. The great continent had fallen to the Romans and this remote, untamed island was the final stronghold of the ancient ways. If the people and the land were to endure they would have to rise up as one against the invaders, and this they did. With a fury. It was a time of treachery, a time of magic, a time of war. It was a time of heros and the monumental deeds that made them legends. A youth, a reluctant hero, rises from tragedy to listen to the ancient voices to free his people from enslavement in the land that will become known as Ireland.

Heath Ledger plays Conor, the reluctant hero and he is just one of the actors in the amazing short-lived series.  If you enjoy  fantasy, good fight scenes, humor and passionate characters then Roar is for you.",1154476800,22,849,4.360759493670886

2611143,3,B000GGSMO4,"Ah, memories. It's been a while since the 90s, but I still carried vague memories of this show: passing attempts at Irish accents, blue face paint, the haunting strains of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loreena-McKennitt/dp/B000002NHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loreena McKennitt</a>, and a teenaged Heath Ledger in the role that he later credited as taking him to Hollywood (at least according to an article I once read in Girlfriend magazine).

Airing back in 1997, ""Roar"" was set in ancient Ireland and based on the scenario: ""what if the Romans tried to invade Ireland?"" In reality the Romans not only didn't reach Ireland, but never even tried, though it makes for a solid enough premise. The overarching storyline involves the disparate Celtic tribes realizing the necessity of uniting under a leader in the common goal of defending their homeland against the encroaching Romans.

This leader is Conor (Heath Ledger) a young prince who is the last surviving member of his family slaughtered at the hands of the Romans. He joined by his father's champion Fergus (John Saint Ryan) who acts as his bodyguard and father figure, an escaped slave girl (Vera Farmiga) with a few secrets of her own, and Tully (Alonzo Greer) the token black guy. Representing the Romans is the ambitious, manipulative Queen Diana (Lisa Zane) and her advisor Longinus (Sebastian Roche) the centurion who speared Christ at the crucifixion and is now searching Ireland for that same spear in order to end the curse of his eternal life. The titular ""roar"" is the mystical strength of the land that lives in all of them and helps Conor unite the divided tribes. Or something. It's not too clear, and it doesn't come up much.

Originally airing on FOX television, the show was shot in Queensland, Australia (you can tell by the gum trees and can even hear a few kookaburras at times) with reasonably high production values, a lovely score, and a talented ensemble cast. On the negative side, it could often be rather cheesy, with uneven storylines and some rather ridiculous elements, such as the tight leather pants of the lads and the midriff skirts of the gals.

Unfortunately, the show was doomed before it had a chance to find its feet, due (as always) to executive meddling. Lawrence Meyers, writer and co-producer, released a statement after the death of Heath Ledger that recounted his memories of working on ""Roar,"" highlighting just how disorganized the project really was:

""As the weeks went by, creative differences erupted between our show-runners, the studio and the network (as they often do). As writers, we felt pulled in every direction. The mandates changed each week. The scripts suffered as their tone had to repeatedly be altered to fit the whims of our multiple masters. One week the show was very grounded in reality. The next it had special effects. One week it had magic. The week after magic was outlawed. It drove us nuts.""

Unsurprisingly, the show didn't perform well enough to warrant a second season. In fact, it didn't even last the entirety of the first season, as its initial run only aired eight of the thirteen episodes before getting cancelled. Despite its cult-following, late-comers to this show who are discovering it for the first time on DVD shouldn't come into it expecting another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>.

I had fond memories of this show, and I recalled the odd scene here and there, but coming back to it many years later was something of a disappointment. There are some very good episodes, but also some real duds, and though the actors give it their all, many of the characters remain bland and without clear motivation. Honestly, it's a mess, but it's an *interesting* mess, and the seeds of potential were there, mainly thanks to its talented cast who keep things grounded despite the crazy swings in mood and content.

There were also several interesting story-arcs at work, namely Longinus's search for the Spear of Destiny and the gang's dealings with the Druid Father (a little boy), as well as Fergus's attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter Molly (Melissa George). It's also fun playing ""spot the obscure television actor,"" as you never know who's going to show up amongst the guest-stars who later made it big in other shows.

Among the characters Catlin and Fergus are the stand-outs. John Saint Ryan is wonderful as the gruff, wry, protective, fallible Fergus, guilt-ridden over the deaths of those he was meant to protect, and eager to reconnect with his long-lost daughter. His father/son bond with Conor is the central relationship of the show, and often the stories revolved entirely around the two of them (they're the only two characters to appear in every episode). He maintains a great banter with Heath Ledger's Conor throughout and has a genuinely touching love for his young charge.

Vera Farmiga played Catlin with a wonderful blend of strength and vulnerability, and was a fan favorite for the way her calm, sensible demeanor concealed a tragic life - the two episodes that showcase her Christian faith and her missing sister are two of the best in the series. A scene in which Catlin has a vision of being reunited with her sister even moved me to tears. Strangely, although she seemed the natural match for the lead character, the writers eventually began to favor the feisty Molly over the more serene Catlin as a love interest for Conor. They were also completely adverse to the idea of the two women sharing any screen-time at all, as whenever one was prominent, the other was low-key. The situation is unresolved at the end of the series, and Catlin is unfairly missing from the final episode.

Sebastian Roche is certainly the most intriguing of the main cast as an immortal who is desperate for death and finally driven to despair by the curse laid upon him (never mind that the real Longinus converted to Christianity and was made a saint on his death - though they do lampshade this in the show when he mutters: ""they haven't made me a saint...yet"") and Lisa Zane looks like she relished playing the seductive, amoral Queen Diana. However, it's never particularly clear what she's doing in Ireland in the first place, why Rome sent her there, or what her long-term goals are. Although she gets a great scene in the second-to-last episode, for the most part she's given little agency of her own.

And of course Heath Ledger as Conor all but carries the show, acting as its anchor throughout the odd changes in tone and story. It's clear that he was a major talent even at the age of seventeen, and watching him is another reminder that he was taken away too soon.

A couple of interesting characters (such as Galen and Claire) are introduced only to be unceremoniously dumped, and Tully is underused to the point of irrelevancy, not even appearing in the final episodes - though that's part and parcel of the disordered production of the show. There are some great episodes, such as ""The Spear of Destiny"", where Longinus's story-arc comes to its climax and ""The Cage"", a genuinely funny episode in which Conor's clan attempts to outwit both the traitor in their midst and the Romans, as well as ""Red Boot"" and ""Tash"", the two Catlin-centric episodes. But there are also some doozies, such as ""Traps"" (the gang tries to survive a trap-ridden island, getting help from a man disguised as a tree) and ""Daybreak"" (Conor and Fergus defend an empty village, ending in a baffling anti-climax), not to mention the truly awful ""Sweet Bridget"". In this season finale Conor rescues a midget, brings a fire sprite to life from clay, and saves her from a man with blue hair. It's a shame that the show went out with such a horrendously bad episode.

Watching it recently, it was sad to see its inevitable deterioration (thanks to the network meddling) from something dark and edgy to a campy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules-The-Legendary-Journeys/dp/B000NQFRU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules The Legendary Journeys</a>&nbsp;knock-off. That said, I can't really recommend ""Roar"" despite my enjoyment of it. I'd suggest watching it on-line before committing to buy it, and I can't really see it appealing to anyone besides Heath Ledger fans, or those who were won over by its odd charms when it first aired back in the 90s.",1311120000,7,8493,5.096333572969087

2611145,3,B000GGSMO4,"I remember this show being on many years ago, when I was still in junior high, and liking it a fair bit.  I remember it being cancelled, and kind of wondering what happened to it.  Years later its come back to memory, and I find they have the complete series on DVD.  Unfortunately its not as good as I remember.

A bit of a forewarning -- take this series with a BIG grain of salt, especially as far as historical accuracy goes.  As has been pointed out by numerous people, Ireland was never invaded by the Romans.  Additionally, the actual period of this series (about 400 AD) was only a few decades before Rome's final collapse -- Rome was actually in the process of withdrawing troops from the British Isles, rather than throwing in numerous reinforcements.  In addition, costuming and props are wildly inaccurate -- for instance in the Pilot episode, a villain is shown wearing a reproduction of the famous ""Sutton Hoo"" helmet, a helmet style which did not come about until some 300 years AFTER this period and was Saxon, not Celtic in origin; additionally Keri Russel's attractive yet sleeveless dress would have been a big no-no for a Dark Age woman.

As for the ""spiritual"" side of the show, again a grain of salt is advised in taking in and interpreting this aspect.  The show deals less with real Celtic mythology and more with the ""Mist of Avalon""-style New Age pseudo-Wiccan type of spirituality.  Nothing is really ever said about the Celtic deities, and the druid character Galen is more of a Yoda-esque mentor/Merlin-esque magician than anything that actually resembles the historical druids.  The producers instead employ a more ""hippie-fied"" version of actual Celtic religious life, wherein Conor must connect with the ""spirit of the land"" to give him strength and fortitude.  The addition of Longinus and his curse is however an interesting plot device, if again not all that accurate with actual history or spirituality.

As for the show's writing, characterization, and plot content -- its your typical ""coming of age"" tale meets revenge plot meets ethnic unity mythos.  There are all the archetypal (or cliched) elements you see in these styles of stories -- the self-absorbed hero who is thrust into a greater destiny through personal tragedy which transforms him spiritually and physically.  Its all pretty much by the books, and you can see it as either a cliche or an archetypal path, depending on how generous you want to be.

So for my recommendation -- take this as escapist fantasy with a loose tie to any kind of history.  Enjoy it, but don't try to take much from it or read much into it.",1294963200,4,2619,4.7844444444444445

Just look at your TV Guide and look for something good which you will find very hard. It has been growing in that direction now for a very long time..I also can see it will not stop for some time because the public is excepting of it but their will come a day people will stop watching even if they have to watch their own DVD's which is what I am beginning to do now that I have a lot of DVD's tv shows and movies. Works for me. Think about it TV programing is over 80% or more Reruns so why not put my DVD's in the line up. I have stopped watching these stupid reality shows ..

That being said, it is fantasy and (like most series and movies of its ilk) wildly historically inaccurate.  As has been mentioned before the Romans never invaded Ireland and by 400 AD their power was beginning to wane and their empire to crumble.  The best way to view 'Roar' is in the guise of classic fantasy, that is a story that takes place in an alternate universe - which could also account for the disparity of the characters' accents!

2611164,4,B000GGSMO4,"that Heath Ledger had done a TV series.  I just happened up it while searching for some of his movies.  So i bought Roar and recently finished up watching it.  He plays Conor who's family has been killed by the romans leaving him with his best friend and confidant Fergus (who's pretty comical at times).  He has to try and unite all the tribes so that they can battle with the Romans as one united front.

It is interesting to see how the characters interact with each other and although the show was only on for a short amount of time (13 episodes).  It left you wanting to know what happens with each of the people involved and whether Conor was able to unite the tribes and lead his people to victory.  Its pretty decent in the action department and acting is cool as well.  A nice but bittersweet trip down memory lane as Heath Ledger is no longer with us.

2611178,5,B000GGSMO4,"It is only a coincidence that I am reviewing this show such a short time after the tragic death of Heath Ledger.  I thought he was a wonderful actor and am very sorry he will not be in any more fantastic shows like this one (and several excellent movies he was in.)

ROAR is about a Roman-era Celtic princeling of about 16 - named Connor -  who is careless and self-absorbed (at least for a prince who isn't actually evil).  He has an older brother who will be taking their father's place as the leader of their people. Because he knows he is not the heir, he doesn't concern himself with taking care of the people or learning to be a leader.

Then, on his brother's wedding day, a rival leader from a nearby ""clan"" shows up with all his warriors and kills off Connor's family and most of the people he knows.

After the obligatory grief and lessons, Connor's life becomes a quest to take care of his and other people and to stop the evil clans and the Romans from repressing and/or killing the defenseless.

The ROAR of the title is Connor's calling and the hope of a peaceful and prosperous future through the cooperation of all those who want it.

Well, that's how I saw it anyway.

There are terrific characters and some very inventive curses and primitive technology (like boobie-traps and various weapons).  Also, there's the 100-year-old centurion who speared Jesus on the cross and his quest for the spear and its power.

Heath Ledger was wonderful in this show.  It was very obvious that he had the qualities of someone who could be extremely successful as a movie star.  He lived up to those expectations well.

John Saint Ryan as Fergus is the anchor of the cast.  He keeps everyone on track and injects the wisdom and strategy Connor needs to succeed in his quest.  Not to mention the protection he provides when Connor gets himself into tough situations.

Don't get me wrong, Connor can mostly take care of himself, but he is still a rash teenager who exhibits lapses in judgement.

Lisa Zane as Queen Diana and Sebastian Roach as Longinus are excellent additions as the most evil elements.  Longinus is scary and keeps Diana pushing at her own evil envelope.  Diana provides the bratty-but-sometimes-sympathetic spoiled woman who will do anything to earn her way back to Rome, where she can get a decent bath and live among ""civilized"" people.

Keri Russell as Clair is the love interest that drew Connor away from his family during the wedding feast.  This saved his life, but of course he sees it as only a dereliction of his duty.  Talk about Survivor Guilt!  Clair's father was the leader who slaughtered Connor's family, so there's a conflict in what Connor should do about that particular sin.  Clair isn't in the series a great deal, but her moments are good ones.

The other characters are a nice fit in the cast as well.

Please see ROAR at any chance you get.  Then, when it's over, if you really loved it as I do, try reading the books.  Most of them are original stories and are true to the purpose and people of the story.  It's very easy to create mental images of the characters and places in the show while reading the books.  I found it delightful.

The DVD is a quality transfer and arrived quickly. There weren't any extras, but I care much more about the show itself than would-be bonus material. Thanks, Shaun Cassidy, for being Exec Producer and Writer on this show.",1202601600,13,3402,4.5627062706270625

2611181,2,B000GGSMO4,"Roar is set in a sword and sorcery world that is very light on the sorcery. The violence is generally low key and de-emphasized.

Fantasy needs to be tied to something concrete and/or familiar that the viewer can identify with. If it fails then it won't hold your interest. It has no literary weight and feels pointless, like Roar.

This is supposed to be about indigenous people struggling to unify against an ongoing Roman invasion. You very seldom see the Romans invading anything.

The plot of the overall show does not move forward. It might be said that there is no overall plot. Everything they were planning to do in the second episode they are still planning to do in the sixth episode, heroes and villains.

The characters do not change. No one gets better at anything than they were in the first episode. None of the main characters so much as changes their minds about anything. Even what is set up as a big deal is almost never mentioned again and never affects the events or quality of the show again.

In every episode models and underwear models travel through the woods alternately sneaking and dashing. Every episode sees someone go on an emotional journey with emphasis on sadness and hope. That makes this a drama about pretty people more than anything else.

Roar has too little sword, sorcery, plot, characterization and weight.",1198368000,11,1350,4.747863247863248

There were trading links between Roman Britain (present day England, Wales and southern Scotland)and Ireland but that's all.  The Romans maintained that they could conquer Ireland with one legion, but they never put this claim to the test! And I really wish non-Irish people would stop trying to ""do"" an Irish accent - there are many Irish accents depending on location, but actors always manage to invent some new cringeworthy one.  I found myself watching this series in the same way that I'd watch a horror movie I don't want to watch but can't look away from -with a sense of horrified fascination. For pure enjoyable Irish/Roman/Greek hokum, I much preferred the episode of ""Hercules, the Incredible Journeys"" where our hero ends up in Ireland and helps defeat an attempted Roman invasion.",1176768000,11,937,5.032258064516129

Ireland and some actors having trouble with the accent). The scenery is beautiful and the storylines are often deep, mystical, and beautiful. One thing I greatly enjoyed was how both paganism and Christianity were presented side by side, both given respect and neither pushed as the superior (that's probably what killed the show with Conservative sponsors, now that I think of it). Sadly, as many have mentioned, the gorgeous Celtic ballads of Ms. McKennitt (sorry if I misspelled) are not included on the dvds (which is the reason for four and not five stars). Her music set the tone for many poignant scenes of the show. Besides that, the show is extremely enjoyable and it is interesting to watch a young Heath starting out (although my favourite actor on the show was Sebastian Roche who was just amazing).

I first saw this airing as re-runs on the Sci-fi network, but learned it was orignally aired in 1997.  They did not release this on DVD until late 2006; there were a few online petitions begging for it's release.

2611194,3,B000GGSMO4,"Ok the only reason i bought this is because i was an extra in a few episodes and it didn't do too well when it was released in Australia and was Axed after about Episode 6, if i recall correctly. And i wanted to see myself in the other Episodes. Other then that...
Its actually better then i remembered . I thought it was a tad on the poor side when it came out, Even though every girl i know loved it.. Think thats the because of the Heath element.
I never originally saw the Pilot , Which is a must. Other wise the entire series doesnt make much sense. Because its the Pilot episode that explains the entire reason for Conors (heath Ledger) trek through the wilderness. So its a good thing its on the DVD. I won't go into story details, for those who haven't seen it.
Some of the scenery is kind of a laugh.. It Ireland , Filmed on the Gold Coast, Queensland Australia. so the scenes with gum trees make the Ireland illusion fallible. I expected to see some kangaroos in the back ground. :)
to see what i mean check out Disc 2, First Ep. ""Red Boot"" , the first scene with Conor and Fergus on the horses.. Gum trees man! Gum Trees!
Anyhow.. i enjoyed watching the entire series for the first time, and would recommend it to anyone who liked the first few episodes from TV in Australia. Heath Ledger fans , its a must have.. his first lead role, and he's quite good , bar the few slips of his Irish / Aussie accent. Melissa  George fans, Its a must have, With one of her early roles, although one scene of hers took 13 takes, but not sure if that was her fault or the Directors. Its filled with plot holes , and unrealistic events, but hey, its fantasy! So if your up for something that partially based on 11th century Ireland, filled with Magic and Adventure, and of course, Double helpings of Heath Ledger, then this is worth giving a go..

I highly recommend this set, as long as you are not bothered by anachronisms.",1167868800,,431,4.2682926829268295

2611198,4,B000GGSMO4,"Although this series was short lived it was an interesting look at Celtic life, admittedly a bit fantasized, during the late Roman occupation of Britain.  This is one of the earliest star turns for a very young Heath Ledger and he brings energy and intensity to the role of the youthful warrior.  The immortal villain, Longinus, is interesting as well, although his presence is not fully explained.  I would have preferred a more objective portrayal of the Romans rather than painting them as the evil counterparts to the ""good guy Celts"" but I overall I found the series an interesting departure from mob stories and sitcoms that now flood the airwaves.",1167782400,3,654,4.873873873873874
2611199,5,B000GGSMO4,"A few years ago I was flipping through the channels and stopped on a young Heath Ledger on the Sci Fi Channel.  As I was about to leave for class I couldn't stop and watch the marathon.  I had caught many of the episodes over the past few years, but I had never seen the entire show.  I was absolutely extatic that it was coming out on DVD.  I preodered it and had it watch soon after I received the box.

The show is totally up my alley.  If you are at all interested in history, especially ancient history this series is very cool.

It's set in England during the Roman occupation.  Heath's character, Conor, is a young prince of a celtic tribe in the area.  The series begins with his older brother's wedding.  Conor is in love with Keri Russell, but her father, is against their relationship.  He's a Roman.

Through tragic events, Conor's family and village is murdered and destroyed by the Romans and Keri Russell is killed trying to save Conor.

The series goes on to follow Conor become a leader to the Celts and waging a guerrilla war to drive out their Roman oppressors.  Along the way many interested characters join the cause.

It's interesting, adventurous, and fun.

I highly recommend it!",1167782400,,1203,4.5
2611200,5,B000GGSMO4,"This series deals with very early Anglo-Irish history and holds all the classic characteristics of this era - adventure, magic, political struggle, tragedy - all the things that are nice to look at and fun to contemplate.  Small children should probably be barred because of the violence, which is graphic, but not upsetting for adults who accept it better on a number of levels.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was sorry to see that it was not continued.",1164758400,3,453,4.794871794871795
2611201,4,B000GGSMO4,"I read through all of the current reviews on here before posting this and I was very surprised to see that so many people seemed to have overlooked something. Maybe I have a memory for detail that others don't? I'm just not sure how you can call a show 'complete' when you're missing some of the vital songs from the original airing of that show.

Yesterday my husband bought me ROAR, since it was one of the things that brought us together and sparked interest in each other while dating. I found myself a bit let down by watching the first episode. Like most TV shows that are now suddenly coming to DVD the studio cut two of my favorite songs from the show. The first song is ""Cymbeline"" from Loreena McKennitt's 'Visit' CD (and the original placement of this song was perfect, it was placed right at the moment where Connor lays down beside Claire's body and reprised when he whispered in her ear at her funeral) It is not only the lack of song that I find infuriating but that (I feel) the studio was too lazy to replace it with anything of value. (At least on Roswell the series creator Jason Katims searched until he found music that fit the themes of what he was replacing before the DVD release) The second song that was missing was from the episode ""Banshee"" and was called ""Mystic's Dream"" from McKennitt's ""Mask and Mirror"" CD. This music opened up the scene where the warriors entered the mists and saw shadows of their worst fears and fed into the fight scene that followed. Both of these songs are what helped to enhance ROAR for it's original audience and I'm depressed that they were not included in this release.

(Actually kicking myself now for taping over my original 1997 tape of the show after I got the DVR of the show off Sci-Fi Channel. Because last night I realized Sci-Fi cut out the scene with Claire's funeral pyre and the vision Connor has of her that leads him to finding his father's sword...Methinks I want a copy of the original once more...)

So, with all of my sullen shadows why did I give it four stars? Well, the picture quality is better than what I've seen previously, a touch more clear and such. The sound quality, although lacking in the poignant music I previously listed, was stellar in terms of mixing and such. They really kicked it up a notch.

Another hole in the production department is that they could have put more effort into making the DVD. There were no extras (and I know for a fact that a pitch reel is circulating out there somewhere so they could've added that into the mix) and the menu's are rather static (but that may be due to the fact the last three or more DVD's I've watched had 'motion menus') I would have also adored some commentary by the former cast.",1164067200,15,2725,4.454909819639279
2611202,5,B000GGSMO4,"This is a really good series set in the dark ages in Island; when the Roman Empire was waning and Christianity was just starting to make an appearance. This Complete Series Set has all the episodes created for the first and only season; some of which never aired here in the USA. The stories are interesting, the characters are likable, and the scenery is breath taking. Also it's fun to see Heath Ledger as a teenager before he became famous.",1163030400,4,443,4.55
