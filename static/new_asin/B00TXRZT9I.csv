8703271,4,B00TXRZT9I,"I bought this dvd because my fav actor, Shahid Kapoor, did a cameo dance number. The movie is typical of the genre produced by the old, established actors who only know how to do one type of film. Having said that, Ajay is the nicest of the Bollywood mafia, and Shahid's contribution was as a favor for his R...Rajkumar director.  You can't lose on a tried (perhaps too much) formula of filmmaking. All Shahid fans (known as Shanatics) must include this dvd in their collection. Others, you can't lose on a typical action adventure, so give it a try.",1429401600,,550,4.555555555555555
