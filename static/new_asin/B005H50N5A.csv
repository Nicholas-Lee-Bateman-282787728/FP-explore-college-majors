8472677,4,B005H50N5A,"Not bad. Good amount of information. A lot of background explaining how ""we could have done this,"" which at points comes off more bitter than productive, but many documentaries do that. The information about the future, and how we could try to make Mars more habitable seems well-informed and optimistic. I would like to see even more people corroborating these ideas (especially the release of methane and 10-year warming plan), but the logic put forth here seems sound. I hope he's right and I hope it happens.",1453852800,,512,4.896551724137931

8472679,4,B005H50N5A,"I came across this on youtube, while looking for a scifi film to watch for a few minutes.  I started watching this, thinking it was a scifi documentary that would lead to a fictional voyage of some sort, but as it went on in great detail about the public policy questions (which were accurate and realistic, as I knew from being a job seeker at NASA at one time), I realized that this was a kind of advocacy plea.  Regarding the science and exploration aspects, it is really good and consistently interesting, indeed inspiring.  But it takes the political angle into context in an instructive and useful way, which is very rare and amazingly, it doesn't detract from the narrative.

Recommended.",1442966400,,695,4.7190082644628095
8472680,5,B005H50N5A,"This video presents a good, logical, well thought out plan to get us to Mars and back in the near term, not 30 years from now.  Excellent message and excellent graphics!  It makes me want to shout out ""Let's go NOW!!!""",1402617600,,218,4.2926829268292686
8472681,5,B005H50N5A,"This updated documentary of Bob Zubrin's Mars Direct plan is the best one yet! It has more footage explaining his plan in more detail and additional digital video footage of what going to Mars would be like under his plan, than the earlier version which aired on the Science Channel a few years ago. This was everything I had hoped for and more! I would highly recommend this dvd to any space enthusiast or scientist.",1363392000,2,417,4.573333333333333
8472682,4,B005H50N5A,"Very interesting documentary,has a lot of footage of future proyects
in Mars. Hughly recommended video to the worldwide public. A cool video
to watch.",1349654400,,150,5.291666666666667
8472683,5,B005H50N5A,"Zubrin is a visionary and good at explaining technical aspects of a mission to Mars.  He explains not only why it is not too expensive to go to Mars but also why it is essential.  Once you watch the film, you will understand the skeleton of his plan and you will see how do-able this mission is.  He does have a little information about The Mars Society -- an organization that he leads.  If you are interesting in Mars and you want to know what can be acheived and why it is important to accomplish and not just dream, this is a great film.",1336089600,2,541,4.173076923076923
8472684,5,B005H50N5A,"Bought this DVD at the 14th Mars Society Convention in Grapevine Texas Aug 2011 and viewed it on my laptop the same night in the hotel room. I had previously bought the older version and it was 5 stars...see my review. I figured how could they top the older 5 star DVD? Well they did!

We see Dr. Robert Zubrin, President of the Mars Society I belong to. We see his and engineer Baker's early Mars Direct program and the later revised Mars Semi Direct program. The US presidents Bush 1 and 2 are shown as well as President Obama and what they had planned for the space program and us stuck in low Earth orbit today with NASA having no clear vision to expand the manned space program out of low Earth orbit.

 We see the titanic "" Battle Star Galactica type spaceship"" that was supposed to be built in space with the help of the ISS but was rejected by Congress because of its $450 Billion price.

 Robert Zubrin shows us on the DVD that we can go to Mars via  Earth shots without the use of the ISS and no titanic spaceship at a small fraction of the cost. By ""living off the Mars land"" and thin CO2 atmosphere we can make the needed rocket fuel and oxygen from the CO2 in the Mars atmosphere with only 5% of the total weight being liquid Hydrogen brought from Earth. 3 much smaller and much less expensive spaceships would be used. This is NOT new technology.

Year 1, an unmanned HAB for later astronauts to live in lands followed by a landing of a spacecraft with a small nuclear reactor to make the rocket fuel, rover fuel,power and O2 on Mars with the use of the liquid hydrogen shipped from Earth. Then a unmanned (ERV) Earth return vehicle is landed.  After getting the signals the rocket fuel for return to Earth ,rover fuel and power are ready and the Hab and ERV are OK...Year 3, a 4 person manned HAB, another ERV and another unmanned craft land. Now lots of redundant life support spaces,supplies and equipment for safety. After a good amount of time (1 and 1/2 years) for exploration,  the 4 person original Mars team blasts off for Earth. Year5  another 4 person manned HAB, another unmanned spacecraft and ERV lands at another site and so on and so on. Later spacecraft/habs will be landed closer together for a possible colony near a good supply of usable frozen underground water and possible underground heating.

Also shown was the group of grad students who started the ""Mars Underground"" that got the first meeting started. People world wide attended. There is much more on the DVD. I just gave a few highlights.

The space animation of the craft shot into space, separating and the landing on Mars is top rate as well as the sounds of the roaring spacecraft. You actually feel you are there going to Mars. The music on the DVD is great too.( Earlier I also bought the sound track CD) ...5 stars.

Here is a DVD that you can tell was put together very well with much attention to detail that anyone interested in Mars will appreciate. This DVD  INMO should be shown in all school and college general science/astronomy 101 classes and copies sent to the US Congress. We have the technology and the people to go to Mars and back today. By using the Mars Semi Direct approach  a multinational Mars manned program would be affordable. Think of all the new technology and good paying jobs that would be created as well as the chance of finding life either extinct or living microorganisms under the Mars surface near frozen water sources. Maybe the question ""Is there other life in the Universe"" would be answered?

There is no difficult math discussed on this DVD and nothing difficult to understand. INMO people at a Jr. high school education level and up will enjoy it. Rated 5 star plus...excellent!",1313280000,6,3719,4.511904761904762
