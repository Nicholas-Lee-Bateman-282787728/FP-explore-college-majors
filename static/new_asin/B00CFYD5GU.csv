Drumming is to die for.  Sound quality really renders what their live show sounds like.  Glorious!!",1377820800,3,266,4.954545454545454
5721849,5,B00CFYD5GU,"Similar to their other concert on DVD, this is a must for fans of Janes or just fans of alternative music.  Great show, audio, and video!",1376611200,,137,4.269230769230769
5721850,5,B00CFYD5GU,"This is a good reunion DVD. Finally able to appreciate Dave Navarro a lot more. I would have loved to have
seen them live in the late 80s or early 90s, but no such luck. Would also like to see them transpose the key(s) for certain songs, as Perry Farrell cannot hit the high notes like he did in the past which happens over time. He is still an incredible performer; great talent. If you've never had a chance to see them in concert, this is a good purchase.",1375833600,,458,4.157303370786517
5721851,4,B00CFYD5GU,"""Expect an orgy of musical and visual delights,"" proclaims JANE'S ADDICTION vocalist Perry Farrell in reference to Live In NYC. While that statement is somewhat of an exaggeration, this 12-song concert, filmed at Terminal 5 in New York, NY in July 2011, begins with two girls dressed in black latex swinging from the ceiling. By the fourth song, `Ted, Just Admit It...' guitarist Dave Navarro is shirtless; meanwhile always understated bassist Chris Chaney drives this spectacle with ease. 12 brilliant tunes spanning 79 highly enjoyable minutes, Live In NYC displays a great light show that transcends the entire venue; and it features the first ever on-stage performance of `Irresistible Force (Met The Immovable Object)', from The Great Escape Artist. Adding to the ever-present theatrical flair, balloons fall from the rafters as confetti cannons fire during `Jane Says'. While it's easy to yearn for deeper album tracks such as `Standing In The Shower... Thinking' and `Idiots Rule' - neither of which were aired on 2010's Live Voodoo - arguing with these riveting renditions of `Ain't No Right' and `Been Caught Stealing' would be asinine. And in the bonus interview, Farrell couldn't be more accurate when he states, ""American Idol is not the answer!""",1375228800,,1258,5.232673267326732
5721852,4,B00CFYD5GU,"Recorded back in July 2011, three months before the release of their fourth studio album ""The Great Escape Artist"" Jane's Addiction played the intimate setting of New York's Terminal 5 in partnership with electronic manufacturer LG to show off the use of 3D technology and is not from the bands 2012 Theater of the Escapists tour. Now two years later after being shown on U.S TV on numerous occasions, the concert gets an official Blu-Ray release as well as being released on DVD and CD. The band is the Strays/2003 line up of the band with Bassist Chris Chaney once again joining the band to take the place of original member Eric Avery who departed again in 2010.

The band wisely sticks to material from their first two studio releases as well as their debut self-titled live album. The band only include one song off the at the time yet to be released ""The Great Escape Artist"" in the form of the first ever live performance of ""Irresistible Force"" as well as ""Just Because"" off 2003's ""Strays"" album. The band opens with the brilliant ""Whores"" which starts after a quick look back at old New York and continuing on with live staple ""Ain't No Right"". There are also great versions of classic tracks ""Ted, Just Admit It"" and the classic eleven minute journey that is ""Three Days"". Both these two tracks feature two scantily clad dancers on stage, one of which is lead singer Perry Farrell's wife Etty Lau Farrell. The guitar playing by Dave Navarro is as brilliant as ever with his distinctive thick heavy funky sound as well as one of the best guitar solos ever in ""Three Days"" The driving bass and guitar of ""Mountain Song"" are unmistakable. It all ends with the sing along ""Jane Says"".

There is only one extra included and that is a ten minute interview with Perry Farrell about the roots of Jane's Addiction. It's a pity that the Blu-Ray comes without the CD so if you want both you will have to purchase both separately. You can get a DVD/CD combo alright but it is well worth getting the Blu-Ray version as the picture is really crisp and clear and delivered in full HD. Also the Blu-Ray cuts out a lot of Perry's pre song chatter yet it is left intact for the CD version. Fans hoping that this would be the 2012 version from Terminal 5 might be disappointed as it doesn't feature much new material as that show. Of course it is always a drawback that original bassist Eric Avery isn't along for the ride but Chris Chaney does a good job as fill in. The band will never recapture those magic day's from the late 80's and early 90's but put them in front of an intimate setting and they show they can still rock as hard as ever.",1373846400,3,2637,4.48024948024948

8581458,5,B00CFYD5GU,"If you like heavy rock, it doesn't get much better than this. Every song has a hook in it. As a musician having done over 2000 gigs, my opinion on this ls from a professional and personal stand point. Everyone I've played it for loved it. First saw it on Palladia and had to have the disc for my eternal collection. Not many concerts make the grade. This is truly a collector's item!",1415404800,,383,4.260273972602739

8581460,2,B00CFYD5GU,"I have to give this at least a couple of stars, since Jane's has been one of my all-time fave bands for the past 20+ yrs, however this dvd doesn't do them any justice. I saw a similar performance in Philly during this same tour and they were AMAZING!!!
This performance is poor in comparison to the show I went to. They were much livelier and Perry's vocals were not as off key and flat as they are in this NYC show. The jams throughout songs like ""Ted Just Admit it"" or ""Three Days"" are much shorter and don't do them the justice they are so worthy of.
Jane's Addiction is capable of so much more.",1409270400,,598,4.163793103448276
8581461,5,B00CFYD5GU,"Huge fan of Jane's Addiction, perhaps their biggest.  Was a little let down by the Voodoo live show released a few years ago (even though I was there in person for the show).  This DVD seems to be of a higher quality and the band is more 'on'.  A great band doing a great show on a great DVD.  What more could you want?",1386633600,2,319,3.9375
