2927134,5,B000UYBOVA,"A very hard critic to the US empire, the media and the opressor part of society that follows and tries to impose their model no matter the social cost. An uprising all over latin america of people who is tired of being ignored, put aside, they're fighting and they are pushing to change the status quo.",1361923200,2,302,4.410714285714286
2927135,5,B000UYBOVA,"John Pilger hits the nail on the head with this presentation.
he covers several countries that have been overtaken by the empire and how it happens.
the reality is not a pretty picture and one that is hidden from the average person.

if you wonder why some countries are poor and struggling and war ravaged, this documentary will explain it.",1360022400,2,341,4.683333333333334
2927136,5,B000UYBOVA,"I watched this film at the Vancouver Film Festival several years ago. I actually went into see this, without a clue about what I was going to watch. I just tagged along with a friend, and just got so absorbed by it.

It's definitely an eye-opener. I recall walking out of the theater, thinking how capitalism seems to benefit us living in the first-world countries, but strip bare the poorer countries that we should be trying to help.
And yet, simultaneously, I remember walking out frustrated at the biased perspectives of the different worlds--the world in which we live in, and the world in which they live in. The documentary was, indeed, incredible journalism, but no doubt the viewer is subject to the biased opinions of the characters that appear in the film, as well as the opinions of Pilger himself. We are left to fend for ourselves--to determine where we stand, and what we can make of the information we have been given.

In any case, the movie inspired an artwork out of me. It is absolutely worth a watch. Even if its political messages do not lean your way, hopefully, you'll at least be exposed to different views and concepts that may broaden your worldview.",1326931200,6,1177,4.681159420289855
2927137,5,B000UYBOVA,"Before emigrating to the U.S., I grew up in Latin America under - what else? - a dictatorship.

I found this documentary very well thought-out and researched. It should be required viewing every American school, every year.

Although I must admit that my favorite part was when the head of CIA Latin American Operations, presented with the facts, said that the U.N. and Human Right Watch are nothing but liars and propagandists. This from someone from the CIA. The CIA, whose daily staple currency is lying, deceit, propaganda, extortion, blackmail and murder!

Not to mention his cavalier attitude that the Americans are allowed to do ANYTHING they wish, in the name of National Security, and because they are Americans. For him, ""National Security"" is America's excuse for any type of action, up to and including murder by proxy.

So long as the American People pay 30 cents less per pound for grapes at the supermarket counter, it doesn't matter if they ruin a nation's economy and condemn an entire people to oppressive dictatorship, torture and death by the thousands...

This is a documentary that every single American should watch. Although for most, it would create no impact or change in world-view at all... What we seem to care about is cheap gas, no matter what the costs to someone else.

I dislike it when an American politician gets on TV and says that the U.S. is the champion of Justice, Democracy, and Freedom.

Once more: Excellent documentary!",1317859200,17,1464,4.902834008097166
2927138,5,B000UYBOVA,"This is an excellent introduction to South America for-- well-- just about all citizens of the United States.  The vast majority of our population knows so little (if anything) about our neighbors.  Yet the fickle majority finds it easy to accept that anyone labelled an evil dictator by the mainstream media must be so.  Philger has compiled an impressive and well-balanced array of interviews with South American national leaders, grassroots citizens, and even former CIA agents andaffluent citizens of ech country who oppose some of the popular leaders.  Gues what? Hugo Chavaz is a human being.  How easy it is to villify anyone who doesn't happen to agree with the American way of life.  Watch this and you may be ready to move to Venezuela, or Bolivia.  A great companion to Olver Stone's more recent, ""South of the Border,"" whicfh I also recommend.",1302393600,22,855,4.937062937062937
2927139,5,B000UYBOVA,I found Pilger's documentary convincing and challenging. It would be a useful documentary for a high school teacher of history or politics to create a lively debate. Has US intervention in South America been altruistic or self serving? If self serving - at what price to the local populations of South America? Did the USA destroy fledging democracies in South America and aid in the installation of criminal dictatorships to serve its own interests and at the cost of thousands of lives? Even if you don't believe everything the film asserts it certainly makes you think beyond superficial propaganda. Full marks to Pilger for this brave attempt to awaken the political conscience of the world.,1242172800,16,695,5.052173913043478
2927140,4,B000UYBOVA,"This is a next doco by John Pilger talentedly telling of modern exploitation of Latin America by mixing Gen. A. Pinochet's military coup with recent Venezuela's affairs while traditionally-for-his-works blaming the USA for all the evil round this region in this case.

One could suggest, perhaps, Sydney-born London-based journalist's energy could more sufficiently be deployed for dismantling a neo-racist ""multiculturalism"" reality of his birth country or/and steadily world-resource-consuming aggressiveness of his historical motherland he flourishing in by supposedly fighting for freedoms and democracy in distant foreign lands mostly, among which the sovereign US are traditional target for loyal monarchists of a N. America's former official master.",1215648000,3,756,6.132075471698113
8215599,5,B000UYBOVA,"I  like the documentary it really is an eye opener ,showing how hypocritical that this nation operates. Well for instance telling the American people we believe in democracy while at the same time promoting polices that under cut democracy in other countries South of the border.",1522454400,,279,5.065217391304348
8215600,4,B000UYBOVA,Americans need to watch this movie and take a different look of US foreign policies,1492387200,,83,4.6
8215601,5,B000UYBOVA,Excellent,1462060800,,9,9.0
8215602,5,B000UYBOVA,"Pilger's commentaries are an absolute must for anyone with questions about America's nonexistent commitment to ""democracy"".  Pilger may be partisan, but he's always got his facts right... that's why he has a point of view.",1441843200,,222,5.3428571428571425
8215603,5,B000UYBOVA,Solidly documented albeit inconvenient truths.,1409270400,,46,8.4
8215604,2,B000UYBOVA,"This documentary is a blend of truth -fiction -falsehoods. Granted the U.S.  has made many errors in Latin America one would think watching this documentary it made nothing but errors.  One of America's earliest critics of Latin American policy was General Smedley Butler who in 1912 was America's most decorated soldier.  General Butler believed that American businesses that invested abroad should not be allowed to use the American Embassy or the Marine Corps  to protect their investments.  Had General Butler's advice been followed in 1912 all of Latin America would be at least 65-70 yrs. behind in terms of socio-economic development what  it is today as it would have been impossible for Latin America to attract investment or borrow money.  Almost everything that is good, modern and benefits people and that has lasted in Latin America has been built by foreigners.  Not just the United States but also Canadians, French, German, Russian.  Everything that is wrong in Latin America was created by Latin Americans, Right - Left -Center - Rich - Poor it does not matter. This documentary focuses on all the wrongs the U.S. in particular has done in Latin America mostly after WWII and of course without showing the huge contributions the United States has made to the region it cannot be called a balanced documentary and it simply 1970s style leftist  Anti - American bigotry.",1408492800,2,1385,5.035087719298246
8215605,4,B000UYBOVA,Very interesting! Had no idea we were such imperialists. My husband thought the movie was very anti American and did not like it but I say we need to look at how we play with others in the world and understand why we don't always have a very positive image in the world. Yeah for those willing to confront this.,1404172800,5,311,4.2
8215606,5,B000UYBOVA,"John Pilger, although clearly from a particular perspective, is not afraid to challenge the status quo and remind us of the imperialism that destroys many people's lives and corrodes the social fabric of Latin America.",1383696000,,218,5.257142857142857
8215607,5,B000UYBOVA,"An indictment of America's incredible hypocrisy in lecturing the world about democracy and human rights while destroying it in countries like Guatemala and Chile, while propping up brutal regimes that are friendly to US business interests. I have mixed feelings about Hugo Chavez (as I do about Castro), but if these authoritarian leaders were friendly to American corporations, they would be praised in the US media and receive American aid and weapons.

The interviews with former CIA agent Duane Clarridge are infuriating to watch. Sounding more like a Mafia hit man, Clarridge proudly and arrogantly asserts the right of the United States to determine other countries' fates if they don't get with the American program.",1380326400,3,723,5.28695652173913
8215608,5,B000UYBOVA,"John Pilger has always been an superb investigative reporter but so many beyond those who admire his reporting are the ones who need to reflect on his message and not have a knee-jerk reaction and think about him as a typical ""liberal"" who's reporting is biased and subject to ridicule.  Unfortunately, those who do ridicule his reporting in such a way have ""drunk the laced lemonade"" and are to late to help.  I recommend this specific dvd to those who have only just begun to doubt what our government have been selling us regarding our military purposes are in foreign lands.",1376265600,2,578,4.712871287128713
