8452010,3,B0050WLY1W,"John Derek's most prominent claim to fame won't ever be that he was an actor or director of some note but, rather, that he put a ring on Ursula Andress and Linda Evans and Bo Derek. Me, I think I would've been cool with that, are you kidding? While Derek did land roles in a few prestige pictures (1949's All the King's Men, 1956's The Ten Commandments), his film career mostly languished in B-movie purgatory. 1954's The Adventures of Hajji Baba, based very loosely on James Morier's novel, is an Arabian Nights swashbuckler and not so bad, despite its flaws.

""Was there ever a princess so cursed?"" wonders the Rose of Roses, the Persian Princess Fawzia (Elaine Stewart). Observe, however, that it's her handmaidens who have just cause to lament, for their mistress, at seventeen years, is pampered and petulant and viperish mean. The handmaidens squabble fiercely over who should disturb her slumber and, by doing so, absorb the inevitable slap in the face. Fawzia is a striking beauty but with a temperament so vile, she's been likened to a storm on the desert and, also, an angry camel and the bite of a spear. Fawzia's father, the Caliph, means to marry her off to an ally. Except Fawzia has been eyeing the bold Prince Nur-El-Din (Paul Picerni), never mind his reputation for gross cruelty and far-flung ambition. But, no, the Caliph has spoken.

In the dusty bazaar of Ispahan, two merchants wager five hundred dinars against each other as to whether the youthful local barber and masseur Hajji Baba can make something of himself in six months' time. Hajji Baba, brimming with confidence, harbors aspirations beyond that of his humble station. He's quick to rebut his dissenters, ""Nay, laugh not! I may carry the instruments of a barber, but I have the desires of a prince."" He sets out to seek his fortune...

...And promptly runs into the disguised Princess Fawzia. She'd stolen away, you see, her destination the desert encampment of Prince Nur-El-Din. For four days and nights, the barber finds himself pressed into escort duty, his covetous soul tantalized by the promise of an emerald ring and one hundred gold dinars. But, as our hero would find out, rescuing princesses is a thankless job. What chance has a barber against the Caliph's soldiers and Prince Nur-El-Din's lurking operative? And what about the marauding Turcoman bandits, those fearsome women warriors what used to be abused harem girls?

There's a racy undercurrent to the plot. Derek, lucky fella, gets to lock lips with three beguiling women: the curvy Elaine Stewart, Rosemarie Stack who plays the sultry slave girl dancer, and Amanda Blake, Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty herself, who plays the iron-willed leader of the Turcoman bandits. For a picture made in the innocent 1950s era, there is no lack of suggestive content.

Indulge me for a mo. I saw The Exorcist when I was a young kid and it freaked me out bad. I'd never seen The Exorcist again, but not because I was so terrified of it today, but because I'm afraid that if I do see it again, it won't be as scary as I'd remembered. See, I cherish that frisson of fright that surged thru me when I was a kid, and I don't want to lose that. I also saw The Adventures of Hajji Baba when I was a kid, and I remember how much fun I had watching it. I saw it again the other day on TCM. And it wasn't as good as I'd thought. It couldn't stand up to my grown-up critical eye. That whiff of nostalgia could only brace it for so long.

It's a campy film, and I think it knew it, so that's good. Second viewing, I found the acting to be awkward and wooden and stilted and the dialogue corny. The best acting job is probably done by that one old merchant guy (the one who won the bet). And while I honor the hell out of Nat King Cole - and ""Nature Boy"" is one of my most favorite songs ever - his constant intrusion of the theme song is incredibly jarring. And I couldn't warm up to the barber hero. I dunno, he was just too cold and mercenary. When he finally professes his love for the princess, it seems to come out of left field. Moments before, didn't he pause his rescue of her to retrieve his prized emerald ring? And does anyone really buy the princess when she impersonates a lad? That bit of silly is redeemed somewhat by a few characters who do easily see thru her ploy. Also conspicuous were the specific color palettes chosen for various set pieces: blue for the bazaar sequences, green for the Turcoman bandits' home base, and stark black and white for the evil prince's desert camp. It's a bold artistic choice by the photographer and the production designer, but such an overt one that each time I noticed it, it momentarily took me out of the story.

3 out of 5 stars for this one. It's mindless, juvenile escapism. It's not quite the childhood gem I'd thought it was. Still, ultimately, despite my grousing, Derek and his decorative cast, and the silly derring-do, and the playfully risqu bits carry the day for me. There is also a trick horse. But he doesn't do much.

Lastly, know what you're buying. This item is a Region 2 disc. You'd best have a Region 2 DVD player or an all-region DVD player.",1477267200,,5138,4.565075921908893
8452011,5,B0050WLY1W,"This film has stayed in my memory from the first time I saw it in the 1950's. What I remember most is it's tongue in cheek attitude to the tales of old Persia like Sinbad and Ali Baba. The film takes the character Hajji Baba from James Morier's book of the same name,and places him in a story of adventure, tinged with the gentle touches of humour that occur throughout the book.
On seeing the film again recently, this attitude is still as  strong as my memory has retained over the many years passed. Only one point has changed. The plot seemed to arrive at it's happy conclusion  with less involvement than my teenage mind recalled originally.",1436054400,,646,4.512820512820513

8452015,3,B0050WLY1W,"Entertaining, at the very least, to see John Derek in something other than ""The Ten Commandments,"" much less a pre ""Gunsmoke"" Amanda Blake swinging a sword a la Maureen O'Hara. OK, so maybe the acting isn't all that great, or the dialog sounds a bit silted, but consider the era it was made. Nice escapist fun.

8452016,4,B0050WLY1W,"This movie is good old fashioned 1950s Saturday matinee fun. As with most Arabian Nights type films, it is not to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, it is a most enjoyable ""popcorn chomper.""

Unfortunately this Cinemascope film is cropped down to a 4:3 aspect ratio, except for the opening section before the credits roll (which is indeed widescreen). This rather expensive Spanish import has excellent audio and video quality. It comes with both English language dialogue and English subtitles. Region code two is set, so most US DVD and Blu-ray players will not be able to run it.",1328227200,5,581,4.989690721649485
8452017,1,B0050WLY1W,"Viewing this movie again after almost 30 years was a big let down. Hackneyed characters, pedestrian conversations and rather poor background sets proved a big disappointment. Even John Derek's good looks, a decent musical score by Dimitrin Tiomkin and vocals by Nat King Cole could not save what is undoudtedly a poorly made movie.",1327190400,,331,5.148148148148148
