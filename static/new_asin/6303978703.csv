7857697,4,6303978703,"This film screams.  Released in Australia as REDHEADS, is is fast paced, a bit racy, and edge of your seat stuff.  Co- starring one of Australia's best, Catherine McClements (Weekend with Kate, Water Rats(TV)) it shows a younger Claudia Karvan to her best acting advantage, a promice of things to come, as realised in Risk, Paperback Hero, Lust and Revenge, The Secret Life of Us (TV) and I am so glad I have this film in my collection, and I am yet to meet someone who is not bowled over by the gritty performances of the leading ladies, the storyline and the production as a whole.  Definately NOT TO BE MISSED.",1037836800,,613,4.504504504504505
