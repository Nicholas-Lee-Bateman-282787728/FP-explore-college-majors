3776290,3,B001RIZ8WE,I love collecting and watching the naruto DVDs.  I find the shippuden episodes more action packed.  What I don't like is the fact that you only get one disc instead of three like in the earlier naruto DVDs.  That means I will have to spend more money!!!!!,1256428800,,255,4.382978723404255
3776291,5,B001RIZ8WE,"I agree with most of the reviews, Naruto is king of the cliff-hanger, we've watched some of these with english subtitles(since cartoon network has stopped showing them and we couldn't wait for these releases). Special note: Naruto IS grown-up this is NOT the beat-them-up and they walk away! There's a lot of the cutesy stuff in these episodes, but it's not all sunshine and lollipops! It's a lot more violent then the 1st series and deals with more mature themes. Hold on to your headband! People will die and secrets will be revealed!",1255737600,,536,4.774193548387097
3776292,5,B001RIZ8WE,"Naruto Shippuden Vol 1 is the first English Voiced release of the 2nd part to the famed Naruto series.  This DVD contains the first 4 episodes of the series.

1: Homecoming (scenes from Manga Vol 34 (Chapters 306 and 207), Manga Vol 28 (Chapters 245)
2: The Akatsuki Makes Its Move (scenes from Manga Vol 28 (Chapters 246, 247)
3: The Results of Training (Manga Vol 28 (Chapters 246, 247)
4: The Jinchuriki of the Sand (Manga Vol 28 (Chapters 248,249)

I find that this set is a great opening and completely worth paying for to get these episodes on DVD. Shippuden seems to accelerate things quickly with multiple storylines possible, such as the invasion and capture of Gaara, the search for Sasuke still continues in the background, and the Akatsuki storyline and characters.  Seeing several scenes from the manga come to life in motion is excellent and the voice actors they chose for the akatsuki are great.  All of the other actors from the first part of Naruto still continue to keep their voices as well.  The only actual difference seems to lie in the background music. It seems to be a bit more mature and serious.

As a DVD, I find that it is a nice offering.  The cover design is stylish (I use it for the background to my iPod Touch), the DVD design is great too, and the case is quite sturdy.  I like owning the actual DVD's so I made sure to catch this set of episodes instead of waiting for a TV release.

The bonuses on the DVD include trailers for Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Shippuden: The Movie, Bleach: The Diamond Dust Rebellion, and Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Council 4.  The DVD also has both English and Japanese vocals and finally subtitles.  Lastly there is a section for ""New from VIZ"" which like all their other offerings includes a general preview of their other anime.

Also this DVD set is original and uncut so it has both a Japanese opening and an ending.

Ultimately, fans and newcomers to the Naruto revolution should pick this one up to get the first four Shippuden episodes (with four more coming at the end of October).",1254268800,5,2051,4.5683060109289615
3776293,4,B001RIZ8WE,"The show is great, but with the characters getting older and hitting puberty they should change up the voices.  The one voice is that of Naruto, cmon' Viz Media, get a guy to play the role of Naruto and get that raspy womens voice to go away.  She was annoying enough in the first part, but make Naruto have an older and more sutble of a voice.  That is my only grip this this, other than that the show is great.",1254268800,,412,4.061728395061729
3776294,3,B001RIZ8WE,"I've been waiting for this for awhile, and for them to release just 5 episodes at a time is a HUGE disappointment.  This appears to be the opposite approach Funimation is taking to releasing shows (large box sets reasonably priced).  Get with the program VIZ; I'll be interested when you are backing 20 plus episodes in each box set.",1252368000,2,333,4.627118644067797

3776296,5,B001RIZ8WE,"Naruto Shippuden is a little different from the early Naruto years. But it is high octane adrenaline! Gaara totally steals the show. The action and story line arc takes up to 30 episodes before Sai comes into the picture. The only dissappointment I feel is in Viz Media, why are they bothering to release Shippuden 1 disc (4 episodes) at a time? They should go directly to box sets! And by box sets I mean, they should carry at least 20 episodes or more per set. Shipuden season 1 is like 50 or more episodes, each season is huge! Viz Media, why must you milk us of our hard earned money and give us so little in return?! Anyone who buys this disc or the next disc in this series, I suggest you hold off watching them until you have them all up to disc 10 in hand, these episodes catch you and never let you go, you will writhe in agony until the next release!",1249948800,25,860,4.186746987951807
3776297,3,B001RIZ8WE,"sorry but i expected more from viz media, this was a huge disapountment to watch, i watched ep. 1-4 on a website dubbed, and the voices were good, but there was no cussing and this is rated 16+ for older teens right, then naruto and sakura should cuss more, also who would pay 25 stupid dollars for a crappish dvd like this, sorry but i would highly suggest a adult swim version of this show instead of stupid censered versions that viz media has created sorry but thats my pount of view:(",1249430400,3,489,4.326086956521739

8338064,2,B001RIZ8WE,I mostly bought it because toonami started showing it. Don't like the first episode.

8338069,5,B001RIZ8WE,"Since 1999, ""Naruto"" created by Masashi Kishimoto (""Karakuri"") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.

For the anime series, since 2002, ""Naruto"" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes.  The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.

Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities.  The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need.  But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.

Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities.  For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions.  He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older.  Of course, there is so much involved in the ""Naruto"" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series.

""Naruto"", the first series ended with the young ninja leaving to train with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years.

Here we are now with ""Naruto Shippuden"" (Naruto: Hurrican Chronicles), a sequel to the ""Naruto"" series which began a month after the first series ended in Feb. 2007 and as of Feb. 25, 2010, ""Naruto Shippuden"" aired its 149th episode in Japan.  The series has been streaming through [...] a week after its airing in Japan with English subtitles but for fans who have wanted the English dub, the series began airing on Disney's XD channel.  The series has been released in individual volumes (with a total of four episodes) courtesy of Shonen Jump Home Video ala Viz Media and also as complete season box sets.

In the sequel, Naruto arrives after his training and now he's a little older, taller but still is the same naive and energetic kid that he was when he left.  Many things have changed since Naruto has left.  Sasuke is still gone.  Sakura has been training under current Hokage Lady Tsunade, while in the sand village, Gaara has succeeded his father as Sunagakure's Kazekage (the leader of the village).

This time the threat to the ninja clans are the Akatsuki, a criminal organization which includes powerful ninjas who defected from their villages and a group which include Sasuke's brother Itachi.  At this current time, not much is known of what the Akatsuki are planning but the ninja clans are all under alert trying to figure out what their next move will be.

Here is a brief spoilerless summary of the first four episodes.

EPISODE 1 - Homecoming - Naruto arrives after his two and half year training with Jiraiya and learns of how things have changed a bit in the village.

EPISODE 2 - The Akatsuki Makes Its Move - The criminal organization Akatsuki makes its move against the Sand Ninja.  Meanwhile, Naruto and Sakura must go against their sensei Kakashi in redoing one of their earlier test trials.

EPISODE 3 - The Results of Training - Kakashi learns how far Sakura and Naruto have become.  Meanwhile, a traitor is revealed from the Sand Village.

EPISODE 4 - The Jinchuriki of the Sand - The conclusion to Naruto and Sakura's test.  Meanwhile, Gaara takes on Akatsuki's Deidara.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

One thing I noticed when it came to ""Naruto"" is that the series has had its share of well-animated and well-painted artistic backgrounds but then for some of the filler episodes, has had a decrease in quality.  Fortunately, ""Naruto Shippuden"" looks very solid.  I really like how the characters look much older and the emotions on the character's faces to the action that takes place in the Leaf and Sand Village is pretty cool.  For the most part, with the four episodes that I've watched, Studio Pierrot has done a pretty solid job with ""Naruto Shippuden"".

As for the audio, audio is pretty much Stereo Bilingual (Japanese and English).  Similar to a series like ""Dragon Ball Z"", with ""Naruto"", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series.  It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.  But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.  Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Naruto Shippuden"" doesn't come with any special features but trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

What a wonderful start for ""Naruto Shippuden"".  So, many fans who have been watching the anime series since its release back in 2002 have grown with this series and watched every episode continuously for so many years and now, here we are with the sequel that is full of action and for the most part, seeing how these characters progressed as a ninja and also have grown older in terms of the way they look.  As usual, there is a lot of action but there is a lot of humor in the series and to see him and Sakura together especially taking on Kakashi-sensei was so hilarious.

These uncut episodes do include the commercial bumpers in the beginning and end and also includes the short animated sequence which features the characters in super-deformed format or features a character teaching the viewer something about their village or special ability.

Overall, ""Naruto Shippuden"" is a great anime series and this first volume is definitely a great start for the sequel.  But if you are planning to watch the series from beginning to end, you may want to purchase the DVD box set 1 which contains the first 13 episodes, special features and a limited edition version of the complete season which comes with a mini ninja Naruto and an exclusive art card.",1268179200,,6616,4.732984293193717
8338070,5,B001RIZ8WE,"Perfect condition & shipped quickly!  The great was so good, I was able to purchase 3 volumns for niece's Christmas gift - she was thirlled!",1264204800,,140,4.6
8338071,4,B001RIZ8WE,"This is a great reboot to an already great series. Liking the idea of aging up and maturing it up to follow its audience while being able to draw in new ones.

My only gripe isn't with Naruto though. It's with Amazon. What is up with the wrong runtime? 30min for 5 episodes? Should be 125min. Not only for this one but even for Vol. 2 and 3 and even the Movie you put up the wrong runtime. Hope you guys fix that.

Aside from that this is a great buy.",1261785600,,451,3.9450549450549453
