8140343,4,B000HLDFG8,"In contrast to the review by GHN below, I was hoping that this video would show highlights from the National Spelling Bee, and it delivered exactly what I had expected.  I usually don't catch the Bee on television, and this video enabled me to catch up on a number of years I had missed.  It is straight off the original ESPN broadcast, which was fine with me.  There were also loads of bonus features, some of which were entertaining (I'll never forget Rebecca Sealfon and I laughed out loud seeing her again) and some of which were pretty lame (such as the ESPN promo spot and the clip from the ESPY Awards).  Two things I wish the video had contained: More behind-the-scenes looks at Bee week in Washington (the speller profiles were entertaining, but I wanted more), and especially a ""where are they now?"" feature showing what has happened to the spellers in highlighted in this video, as well as other past winners.  Overall very entertaining, but as GHN pointed out, it's certainly not a training video for devoted spellers.",1257984000,8,1030,4.7
8140344,1,B000HLDFG8,"I was hoping that this DVD would show some of the training techniques that are used to prepare for these spelling contests; so that my children can enhance their own spelling skills. It only covers the contests - so it was quite a disappointment
