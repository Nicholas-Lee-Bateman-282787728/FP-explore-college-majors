8694254,3,B00R62K12C,"Taken 3 is entertaining but predictable.  Often with movie sequels it's important for you to watch the previous movies in order for you to understand the intricacies of the characters and their relationships.  Taken 3 stands on it's own so if you haven't seen the first or second movie you can still watch Taken 3 and be entertained.  Taken 3 is filled with action and violence but the key component 'Suspense"" is missing.  Nobody gets taken in Taken 3, unless you count the viewer.  The plot departs from the tried and true formula of Take 1 and 2 where somebody actually gets kidnapped and turns into an episode of Columbo or Matlock, where we are to believe that a smart detective is so naive as to figure out the murder mystery despite the overwhelming evidence and circumstances.  While we the audience can figure out who dun it in the first half of the movie the the chief detective played by forest Whitaker can't seem to put things together until the very last scene in the movie.  Taken 3 isn't terrible, it's just not that good either.  This is the kind of movie you rent, watch once and then forget about it.",1427500800,16,1119,4.532338308457711

8694257,3,B00R62K12C,"Taken 1 was excellent, but this one has a somewhat boring plot. Still lots of action, killing, and that ""good stuff"" that action movies should have, but nowhere near the original one.",1401840000,,183,4.75
