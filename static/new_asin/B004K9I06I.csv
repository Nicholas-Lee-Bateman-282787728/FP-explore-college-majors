That is what one watches this movie for ;
{ the story itself needs to be developed.}",1396742400,,123,4.391304347826087
8432631,4,B004K9I06I,"I like Akshay Kumar. This is a goofy entertainingmovie. Besides being a criminal and trying to steal from a small village he does good for the villagers.  I liked how they did the credits at the end of the film. ANd there is always ""Sheila"" the music clip.",1391990400,,256,4.333333333333333
8432632,1,B004K9I06I,"The movie started out badly, was bad throughout and ended badly. Skipping to the music scenes was the only way I was able to get through this movie. Highly recommend downloading the song Sheila Ki Jiwani, very catchy.",1328400000,,217,4.7368421052631575
8432633,1,B004K9I06I,"Music and dance: Lyrics and music were limited in imagination and performance quality. Dance was essentially a boring rotating of Katrina's hips the entire movie.
Acting: Besides the 1930s"" act-stupid, goof ball"" characterizations that seems to appeal to - who knows, there was really no acting just line reading and showing Katrina's body.
Storyline: Steal a vast treasure by pretending to make a movie while using the movie crew and cast was a little too ridiculous which fit perfectly with the lack of acting.",1315872000,,512,5.107142857142857
8432634,2,B004K9I06I,"I was really excited for this movie to come out because a) the soundtrack was just kicking music and b) I loved Farah Khan's previous films, boy was I disappointed when I finally got the opportunity to watch this film.

While the music numbers are excellent and the dancing is pretty good, the simply aweful job the actors are doing tank this film. Everyone and their mother is just over the top and have no depth to them. It seems like not much thought was put into the characters motivation, even for a Bollywood film! It was painful to get through and the only reason I kept going was that I kept hoping it would turn around. Surely Akshay wouldn't have agreed to do this movie if it was utter crap, should have learned my lesson from Blue, but no. This movie really never turns around and gets better, it just stays at the same painfully bad level the whole time through, even the comic relief they throw in as a reward for making it through the movie, just doesn't save this horrible film.

 This movie is like Drona, but has good music....so that is the only reason it gets a two star.",1313107200,,1091,4.364532019704433
8432635,3,B004K9I06I,"I am not overly familiar with Bollywood films but I understand that, as many of them as they make, they are the same few plot lines over and over again. Here they remake an old Peter Sellers movie 'After the Fox.' Tees Maar Khan is a master criminal who is going to pull off a huge heist. To do so he poses as a film director who will shoot his next masterpiece in a small village and use the villagers in the film and unwittingly in the heist.

This is a comedy but the Indian sense of comedy isn't the same as ours so it just doesn't generate many laughs. Their facial expressions and physical movements are all over-exaggerated. Pretty much like something you'd see from Jerry Lewis in the 60s. Those days are long and gratefully gone.

The cast is OK. Katrina Kaif is stunningly beautiful as the female lead. Akshay Kumar is so-so as the male lead. He has a decent screen presence but I found nothing particularly appealing about him. The secondary characters didn't do much for me. Their performances, along with the writing, are out of step with the times.

Surprisingly, at almost two and a half hours, there are only three dance numbers. The first, featuring Katrina, is great. The choreography is outstanding and she is a thrill to watch. The other two are good but pale by comparison. The other production values are OK. The color schemes are vibrant. A lot of primary colors blast their way off the screen. The set compositions are OK as is the directing.

This is not a bad movie but there are better Hindi movies out there and at this length I really cannot recommend it.",1301875200,,1584,4.489583333333333
8432636,3,B004K9I06I,"TEES MAAR KHAN is another addition to the con caper list. It has some uproarious moments like the Bin khopdi ka bhoot track and Atish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) constant desperation to bag an Oscar Award. But the digs taken at Aamir Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Danny Denzongpa are certainly below the belt.

Akshay Kumar plays his role well. But he has nothing new to offer as we have seen him playing several similar roles in the past. Katrina Kaif plays a wannabe actress to perfection and completely sizzles in Sheila ki Jawani. Akshaye Khanna is brilliant. It's actually good seeing him overact as his role demanded that. Raghu Ram and Rajiv Laxman don't have much to do. Salman Khan's guest appearance in Wallah re wallah is first-rate. Chunky Pandey is hilarious. Arya Babbar is decent. Ali Asgar is passable. All the other actors play their part well.",1300579200,,852,4.795918367346939
8432637,1,B004K9I06I,"When you have a director like Farah Khan, naturally the expectations are sky high especially if you have given two blockbusters in a row, i.e. Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om both with Shahrukh Khan. Then there was the rumored fallout with SRK and Farah changed sides to make Tees Maar, a remake of Peter Sellers' 1966 Italian film AFTER THE FOX with Akshay Kumar.
Tees Maar has the right ingredients to be entertaining but the execution, acting, direction all fall apart. TMK is about Akshay Kumar a brazen thief who has attempted several bold heists in the past. He is going to attempting the biggest heist of all time with the help of his cronies and a film crew...The action and the narration increasingly become incoherent. None of the goofs or one liners work and instead end up sounding cheesy. Akshay Kumar, who has never found a script that he did not like, hams like he never has before. If this was his debut movie he would not have a chance in films, I guess he is hell bent on destroying his success. Katrina Kaif briefly sizzles in `Sheila Ki Jiwani' and then fizzles. The biggest disappointment in the movie was in the form of Akshaye Khanna whom the director chose to project her obsession or disappointment with Shahrukh. He enacts the role of an actor who refused Slumdog millionaire (Remember SRK refused the role that Anil Kapoor did), the needless jokes about back surgery. I remember that someone once said that for an entertainer to succeed there should be something significant unfolding on the screen every 10 minutes, this was the also the recipe for success of her idol Manmohan Desai.  In this film she tries to attempt that with cameos by Salman, and Anil Kapoor but things really don't happen. I hope with this movie she does not go the way of her brother Sajid Khan turning out celluloid atrocities. I guess this is the first time in the history of cinema that siblings have released their movies in the same year, Housefull 2 and TMK and both are strong contenders for the worst movie of 2010. If only we had the Razzies in Bollywood.....
Possibly the worse movie I have watched in 2011 and definitely the worst of 2010. One star. 3/7/2011",1299456000,2,2169,4.604651162790698
8432638,4,B004K9I06I,"There is a baddie who is an outrageous show off. He reminds the camera and his sidekicks once every minute that he is invincible. But, this character, played by Askshay Kumar (AK), seems within the realm of reality. AK's acting has been the pillar in this fast paced farcical comedy. He is the heart and soul of this movie.

The story is that he wants to loot treasure which is being transported by special train under guard. AK impersonates as a film Director, enrols an entire village in his ""movie"" and pulls off the heist.

The narration makes the appropriate leaps and reaches a climax without seeming to meander at any point. There is no dull moment. Even so, the Director finds the opportunity to squeeze in the famous item number ""Shiela ki jawani"". The jungle chase in the night also weaves into the story. This is masala movie created by pros.

Katrina Kaif has danced with gusto to the ""Sheila"" number. Akshay Khanna has portrayed the right mix of a Bollywood star desperate to win an Oscar, which promise is part of AK's caper.

The movie could have done vastly better at the box office with a few more hit numbers, including the one where Salman Khan makes a guest appearance.

This is a well crafted Bollywood masala entertainment, and not to be missed.",1297296000,2,1267,4.613333333333333
