5315109,1,B009C30LYQ,"Have been a pretty big fan of TA's workouts for several years, especially loved the original dance dvd, but this new one is terrible. It is impossible to follow, tons of twists and constant turns so even from watching her move from behind, cannot learn the moves because too many spins back and forth.  I am usually very good at picking up all the steps from fitness DVD's, have a huge collection at home from TA to Jillian Michaels to P90X, etc.and this one was a huge disappointment. Personally, I'd stick to the original dance one or just jump around at home with lots of spinning for free.",1362441600,3,593,4.4907407407407405
5315110,1,B009C30LYQ,"I am an avid aerobics girl, and the angles on this video are horrible.  The routine itself is not easy to learn, and the camera angles make it even MORE challenging to learn! They keep panning in on her footwork, then her arms, they need to just stay on her whole body for us to be able to follow!  I got dizzy watching it. On a positive note, her routine is awesome if you can learn it...learning it is the REAL challenge.",1360195200,4,423,4.146341463414634
5315111,1,B009C30LYQ,"It's another video where she is just jumping around for an hour! It's done in a better setting than the last video, but it is extremely hard! Be careful! You also need lots of space to move around.",1358985600,,197,4.2105263157894735
5315112,5,B009C30LYQ,"I was really nervous when I started watching the breakdown of this DVD, which is crucial by the way.  I'm not a dancer and I was intimidated. I watched a few times and then decided to just go for it.  Hell, no one can see me......I think.  Sooner or later you will get it.  Don't throw in the towel.  I wanted to quit every time I tried to learn a new combo but I thought if I try this for 1 month and dont' get something out of it, I'll sell it at the next garage sale.

So glad I persevered.  It's fun and you will NOT get bored.  Does she talk and cue you?  No, but you'll be grateful no one is talking.  Is the music good?  Not really, in my opinion so I just got wireless bluetooth headphones (LG has good ones) and made my own playlist.  Mute the DVD and rock out in your garage or living room.  Check her website too.  She has song suggestions.

I'm athletic and love to dance but I was never a ""remember the choreography"" sort of dancer.  However, this DVD is by far my favorite way to get cardio in my day.  You'll be giving yourself a big pat on the back when you learn the first combo......and you will. Trust me on that.  Do it 10 times and then start learning the next combo.  You'll get a great workout even if you do just 1 combo 5 times.  Good songs for this DVD.....Timebomb by Kylie Minogue......On the Floor by JLo.......Walking in LA by Missing Persons (yes, I'm old)........Shock the Monkey by Peter Gabriel.  They all have similar BPM's....128-134 for those of you that are music geeks.  Yeah, me too.:)",1416614400,,1525,4.204152249134948
5315113,5,B009C30LYQ,I suggest you try her first dance cardio to see if you like this.  Her workouts aren't for everyone.  But if you loved her first cardio then you will love this one.  More difficult for sure and a way to keep it interesting! Her workouts do amazing things to your body!! If you want a lean slim and toned figure you will get it with this!!,1412294400,,338,4.090909090909091
5315114,1,B009C30LYQ,"I did not like this workout video. It is complicated with numerous moves. My expectations were not met. I use workout video's on a daily basis, however this one is not user friendly.",1393200000,,182,4.545454545454546
5315115,5,B009C30LYQ,"Absolutely loved it!! Tracy takes you through the steps required to really work up a sweat.
Great work-out and would recommend all of Tracy's dvd's!!",1382918400,2,149,5.0
5315116,4,B009C30LYQ,"This dance cardio is a challenge for sure! It has complicated moves and moves much faster than her other dance cardio DVD. I find myself getting the hang of it, and for the ones - toward the end - that have not gotten down, I freestyled a bit. This isn't the kind of DVD you can just pop in and start; you definitely need to take the time with the instructions and work through them a few times. if you don't have the patience for that, this DVD may not be for you. But, if you are like me and don't mind having to work a bit at something and get outside of your typical workout/comfort zone, I say give this a shot. I'm not a pro at Tracy's Dance Cardio, but I've done a few of hers and I tend to get the hang of her flow.

Since it is natural to compare this DVD to her other dance DVD, here are some notes if you are comparing:
1) The music is MUCH better than in her other DVD. I enjoy that heavy dance, 4-beat when dancing as it really helps me to keep my rhythm.

2) This DVD has more variety of moves and isn't the same few steps for the entire song. You do repeat sequence(s) - yes with an S - during the songs, but unlike her other DVD, it makes it much more fun to do a longer and more challenging sequence of dance moves.

3) Tracy free-styles in the middle of a few songs Meta-Dance Cardio style. It is a nice break that is missing from the other DVD where it's the same sequence over and over. During a few songs, she'll break up the one run or two runs from the next with some simple jumping moves. It's a nice reset.

4) This one moves much faster.

5) The set, for me personally, is much more appealing. It looks exactly like the set in her Perfect Design series (as this was the D.C. partner to that set). And I love the set, her clothes, etc. It's not as colorful, so if you want bright and light, go for the other one if set and colors really matter to you. :)

Over all, I found this one more fun and way more of a challenge. I like the music, the set, and the moves. It will definitely take practice to get really good at it, but that's part of the fun.

Good luck!",1377475200,10,2086,3.964200477326969
5315117,1,B009C30LYQ,This video is probably a great workout but unless you are a professional dancer the dance combinations and routines are difficult and hard to follow. There are too many moves!,1376006400,,175,4.866666666666666
5315118,1,B009C30LYQ,"This is one of the worst workout videos I've ever seen.  I danced for about 12 years and am very quick to learn choreography.  The choreography in this is ridiculous!  Half her ""dancing"" is randomlhy jumping around.  It is extremely difficult to learn the routine for two reasons: (1) she does not give enough instruction about what foot she is on and (b) it is WAY harder to learn a dance facing someone than if she would simply do a couple of shots facing away from the camera so you can mimic her.  I do her other conditioning workouts and love them, but she should steer clear of doing anything considered dance.  Total waste of money!",1374451200,5,639,4.4655172413793105
5315119,1,B009C30LYQ,"I expected a dance video that was fun!  Instead I have a self-absorbed young lady going over moves to a monotonous beat.

Not at all what I expected.",1370217600,,149,4.285714285714286
5315120,2,B009C30LYQ,"I bought this out of curiosity when the price came down.  I have her Mat and Post Pregnancy workouts and like them, but this is more like jumping around, with little rhyme or reason.  I normally like dancer type workouts. I like the challenge of learning new movements and sequences, but this left me with a ""why bother"" feeling.  I would have loved this when I was 8 years old.  Collage Video says it's good if you're an experienced dancer.  I would love to hear feedback from a real professional dancer regarding the choreography, whether it's good or nonexistent.  But I'm sure I never will.

Another thing.  No warm-up, no intensity arc, no cool-down.  She just jumps right in and  bounces around for 45 minutes.  Even instructional dance videos that aren't workouts per se have a warm-up.  It's a safety thing.  Yes, I can do my own warm-up and cooldown; it's just something I expect from a fitness expert.

I appreciate the instructional sections and the chapters, and that's why I gave it two stars.",1366156800,,1006,4.674285714285714
5315121,3,B009C30LYQ,I am not a dancer just looking for a fun dance/exercise routine.  This seems a little complicated and the dances are very fast and a lot of jumping....handing them down to my much younger daughters who have a dance background they will love them.,1363046400,2,246,4.590909090909091
8539465,1,B009C30LYQ,Horrible instruction. I danced for almost two decades. This was hard to follow. Her instructions went too quickly and it wasn't broken down well enough into segments.,1528675200,,166,5.185185185185185
8539466,5,B009C30LYQ,"I don't understand the negative reviews this workout receives. The method Tracy used is similiar to a dance class. She shows you the dance from front and back and then you do it. As a dancer, I realized this workout required extra time to learn the movements.

I advise watching a two segments, 2-3 times before attempting to do the workout. After that you know what to expect in the combinations and the workout is fun. Then gradually build on with the other segments.. It's a very fun aerobic dance workout. I find it's great for those days as a  break from Hiit training or strength. Love it!",1509235200,,595,4.5
8539467,5,B009C30LYQ,"Tracy Anderson's line of dance dvd's never disappoint. Her dance moves appear quite unconventional initially but trust me, give her a try and you will feel your muscles go to work.",1499817600,,180,4.838709677419355
8539468,1,B009C30LYQ,Too complicated to follow. Loved video cardio dance for beginners. This was too hard to follow,1496016000,,94,4.9375
8539469,2,B009C30LYQ,"It isn't filmed well. The camera zooms in a lot and unfortunately it's distracting and confusing to follow. I've been a dancer all of my life and pick up routines quickly, but I had trouble with this video because aside from the videographer the pace and energy are fairly low throughout the routines. I was pretty disappointed.",1467676800,,328,4.771929824561403
8539470,5,B009C30LYQ,Super fun dance routines!!,1463443200,,26,5.75
8539471,5,B009C30LYQ,"I love Tracy!  But she has come a long way since this.  This is an excellent video to gauge your cardiovascular fitness.  The dance sequences really challenge you.  You cannot just pop this in and expect to do it and that's her point.  You need to be performing and you have to know something in order to performing it.  Watch it, practice it, and commit to it.  You will be successful  A lot of people give her crap but this is a good video and if you master it, you will have no problem with the rest of her videos.",1452297600,,517,4.1
