8098296,4,B000CEVC74,"Surprisingly good low budget comedy stars a perfectly cast Stuart Erwin as a sad sack door to door lingerie salesman named Johnny Dill who has no luck with the ladies.  After seeing the way women react to a James Cagney-like character in a gangster film he spends a single night wandering the town talking like a tough guy to impress women.  It works--ultimately too well.  This leads to a series of misunderstandings where Johnny Dill is mistaken for a real tough guy, framed for knocking off a powerful gangster and becomes public enemy number 23.  He even builds up such a fierce reputation that he becomes the nominal head of an actual crime syndicate.

Killer Dill isn't exactly a classic but it's fairly clever and amusing with Stuart Erwin providing a wonderful performance as a complete innocent who can't quite believe how much trouble he has gotten himself into and has no idea how to get out.  Killer Dill can be viewed as a commentary on the Warner Brothers gangster films that glorified violent criminals and made stars of James Cagney, Edward G Robinson and Humphrey Bogart.  If you enjoy films like Public Enemy and The Roaring Twenties then you might also get a kick out of this comedic take on similar material.",1485388800,,1228,4.737089201877934
