8495839,3,B006AV053U,On the 5th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...ECW Fancam(11-10-2000). The Balls Mahoney-Mike Bell match was so-so at best. The Da Baldies-Christian York/Joey Matthews tag team match was pretty basic and boring. The Nova-Bilvis Wesley match was another dull and boring too. The World Tag Team Championship between  Little Guido/Tony Mamaluke & Super Crazy/Tajiri was not great but pretty good. The New Jack-Blue Boy match was lame at best. The Danny Doring/Roadkill/the Sandman-EZ Money/Julio Dinero/Chris Hamrick 6 tag team match was fun to say the least. The Kid Kash-Simon Diamond match was a fine match but something just didn't click with it. The World Championship between Steve Corino & CW Anderson was a solid contest even with the interference. The Jerry Lynn/Scott Hall-Justin Credible/Rhino-tag team match was decent to say the least too. I give this event a 6 out 10.,1418860800,,887,5.2027972027972025
