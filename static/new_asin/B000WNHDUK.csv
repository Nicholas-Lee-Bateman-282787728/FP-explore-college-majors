8224340,2,B000WNHDUK,"ok, I understand the concept of the slow changing images and all that which is fine with me but ONLY if the images are good ones! The graphics are awful, the scene doesn't make any sense, and some of the images in the scene are downright unrecognizable! and before you go thinking its my TV set,  I have a 42"" HDTV! Maybe thats the problem, I don't know. Maybe this was made for an older picture tube TV set and it just doesnt hold up to the modern flat screens. Well whatever the issue, I will NOT be playing this at my Halloween party. I got another DVD I like a lot better where the graphic artists actually have some skill and talent.",1381017600,,638,4.186991869918699
8224341,5,B000WNHDUK,This is a cool DVD.  We used it as a background for our huge halloween party last year.,1272672000,,87,3.8333333333333335
8224342,4,B000WNHDUK,"I bought this and used it as a background visual for a party.  It created an appropriate piece of artwork on the wall instead of a blank flat screen.  The trick is to look every once in a while and see what has changed. Once cannot detect the changes in the sceene as they occur.  Pretty neat.

Although the DVD comes with audio, I used only the video as background and played party music instead.  However, on the 31st, it will be fun to play the included audio.",1192579200,,463,4.215909090909091
8224343,4,B000WNHDUK,"If you are tired of looking at the big black hole in your living room known as the TV, this is the DVD for you.  ""A Halloween Moon"" is not something you watch like a movie but something you look at every now and again. It changes very slowly so you see something new each time but you don't see it change...Really cool.  I can't wait for more titles like this one.",1192492800,,364,4.041666666666667
