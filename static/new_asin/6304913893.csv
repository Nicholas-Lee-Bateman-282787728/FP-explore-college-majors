951045,5,6304913893,"One of the best Japanime movies ever created, Iria :Zeiram the Animation is about a female bounty hunter apprenticed to her beloved brother, Gren.  While on a mission with Gren's boss, Bob, they incounter an indestructable monster called Zeiram. The monster was under study to harness its power and create a weapon of mass destruction.  Zeiram breaks free and goes around assimilating people to stay alive.  Bob and Iria barely escape, but Zeiram assimilates Gren.  Iria vows to kill the murderer of Gren and does so with the help of Kay, Fujikoro, and Bob, who had been trapped in a computer when his human body died.  A great set of movies and one you should see.  END",894844800,2,670,4.683760683760684

I caught it in the middle and since then had seen it from the beginning and even caught the live action films that inspired it.

Iria: Zeiram the animation is old school anime but still holds up today. it's futuristic yet retro/eurasian designs are still some of the most inspired I've seen and the action and weapons are top notch. A great little series to pass some time.",1327968000,,525,4.412371134020619

There are problems:
The ending was horrible.
The intro was horrible.
A lot of the city structure and vehicles are umbrellas or balloons.
There are some weapons that are tops like the ones being ejected from the vehicle.
There is only one concentration, which is just the monster.
There should have been a background of how the monster was even created.
Then there seemed to be more than just Zierum as the antagonist such as the government or other organizations.
Why wasn't there another way to free her brother?  Seemed kind of heartless, just go for the kill, for that revenge without another solution.",1231286400,,670,4.717948717948718

951226,5,6304913893,"A classic anime, and one of the very first anime films that drew me into the genre. Read up any of the other 80+ reviews if you want, I myself am surprised that there has been that many reviews.

The animation FYI, is great for 1994, which was when it was originally released. Those who critique this film should remember that.

Also, if you have ever seen the live-action film Zeiram...the creator making this into an anime was the best, most sane idea he ever had!",1196726400,,466,4.406976744186046
951227,5,6304913893,"Iria is a hairbead-wearing rookie bounty hunter on a perilous mission to find her big brother and mentor, Gren, who was last seen battling the dreaded, unstoppable space creature known as Zeiram.  Rocketing through space in her yellow creeper--which resembles Luke Skywalker's landspeeder--the armor-plated apprentice hunter in the crimson-colored, artichoke-shaped cloak is determined to find Gren and destroy Zeiram before the Shadow Zone kids, Kei and Komimasa, eat all of her precious space rations.  Guided along the way by a mysterious voice on her comm, and with additional, unwanted assistance from her dempadan-piloting rival, Fujikuro, young Iria blasts her way through hoards of skinny red robots in pursuit of the dark villain, Zeiram, as he teleports from one transembler to another, absorbing everyone in his path by devouring them in the fangs of the grotesque, white-faced worm that resides in the center of his big black hat.

'Iria Zeiram The Animation: The Complete Collection' is a 3 DVD set.  Disc 1 contains the first three half-hour episodes; disc 2 concludes the story with the last three episodes.  Disc 3 is loaded with special features, including, character sketches, concept art, and creator interviews.  The picture quality is excellent and there are two audio options: English 2.0, or Japanese 5.1 Surround.  The series is rated 13 and up due to some bloody violence and a very brief shower scene, but it certainly doesn't deserve the R rating listed here as it contains no sex and no bad language in the English dub (there is some swearing in the subtitled version).

This is an essential purchase for any anime fan.  Iria is a very cool character and the vast, exotic Myce landscape, dotted with towering, mushroom-like structures, creates a uniquely weird and wonderful atmosphere.  The soundtrack is also terrific, and the opening animation, with huge snowflakes falling before Iria's big, brown eyes, is unforgettable.  Buy this OVA.  It's one of the best.

951228,5,6304913893,i love this Anime! ive loved it since i was a little kid and im so happy i found it and bought it!!,1190073600,,99,3.347826086956522
951229,5,6304913893,"Iria is one of those anime that made its way over to American early and was able to have an effect on people. I saw a piece of this anime on the Sci-Fi Channel a long time ago, and since then I've always wanted the entire collection. Though the dubbed voice-acting is dated, and the animation a little washed, it matches up well with other action-oriented sci-fi anime of its time (the animation style somewhat matches the anime series DNA2). Plus, it has a solid story, if a bit used, that carries the OVA from episode to episode.

Iria, an assistant bounty hunter to her brother Gren, was dispatched along with Gren and another bounty hunter named Bob on a rescue mission in deep space. Yet upon arriving, they realize something isn't right. The ship in which they were sent is piled high with bodies, and all of them were killed at the hands of a fearsome and indestructible artificial alien named Zeiram. In an attempt to escape the ship with her life, Iria is separated from her friends. But Zeiram haunts her, both physically and mentally, and her battle to uncover the creature's weak-point, as well as her search to find her friends and family, comprises the next five episodes (the synopsis above is of the first episode). Along the way Iria meets a few new friends who aid her in her fight against Zeiram, including a sheep-in-wolf's clothing named Key, who's a young orphan and expert thief that idolizes Iria.

The characters in this series aren't that unique; Iria is the tough-minded chick with a soft side that shows in times of high emotion. Gren is the powerful bounty hunter role-model. Key is the mischief maker and comedy relief. And Zeiram is the overlord character, that evil entity that wants nothing more than to destroy. Despite this, though, the characters works well with the story, and nothing seems forced. The episodes flow along following the exploits of Iria and her friends.

Like I said before, the animation itself is a little washed, but that doesn't take away from the quality of the animation. Every character is highly detailed, and the action scenes are great, especially when compared to other anime of that time.

But what makes this anime even more special is this collected edition of it. You get every episode of the OVA, along with a bonus disc of special features (and we know as anime fans how anime never truly has any special features, so anything added is welcome); it has creator interviews, art galleries, a sing-along-song (which is ridiculous but fun nonetheless), and the common trailer show-case. Plus, it comes with both Japanese and English tracks, and truthfully I'd recommend the subbed track before the dubbed. And you get all of the this--entire OVA and bonus disc--for less than forty bucks.

Iria, while not the most original anime to ever come out, is definitely one of the most entertaining. If I were to rate the anime separately, I'd give it a 4, but the package deal makes it easily a 5 or more. It's one of the early anime to make a difference here, and also one no anime fan should miss out on. Pick up Iria: Zeiram the Animation if you want to see a solid, sci-fi action anime that no doubt inspired many other future anime.",1139097600,,3197,4.671403197158082
951230,5,6304913893,"IRIA is a benchmark piece of animation.  Done in 1995, IRIA continues to stand the test of time with it's beautiful artwork, excellent storyline, and fantastic characters.

Synopsis:

Iria, a bounty hunter who has just reached legal working age, must track down and destroy a nigh-invincible space creature named Zeiram.  Her motivation is revenge for the death of her brother, whom Zeiram kills at the outset of the film.  A twist is thrown into the plot when Iria discovers that Zeiram has assimilated Gren, using Gren's body to reform its own after it is  destroyed in a spaceliner exposion.

Standing in Iria's way is Tiddan Tippedei, a huge business conglomerate specializing in weapons development, that wants to capture Zeiram and use it for purposes of war.

Iria is an excellent female protagonist, a bad-ass chick with a heart of gold; not to mention an arsenal of super-cool gadget weaponry.",1134259200,,902,5.006711409395973

They were fooled when that cargo happens to be none other Zeiram, Iria's worst enemy. Zeiram is a fearless alien monster that broke lose from a corportation. See what happens next.",1121212800,2,301,4.490909090909091
951232,5,6304913893,"I could be mistaken, but I think I've found the holy grail of anime sci-fi action. But what makes for a good sci-fi action show? In my experience, it a combination of a likable character, excellent fight choreography, a sweet soundtrack, cool weapons and gadgets, atmosphere, and action, action, action.

First of all, this OVA has some of the slickest presentation I've ever seen in an anime. The opening, the closing, the music, the way the shots are composed...10 out of 10. The animation and artwork are also absolutely top-notch. Looking at the backgrounds in this show made me think of some of the awesome concept art we sometimes see in the opening or closing of a show but almost never in the actual show. How to describe the style? It's a bit like the very best art in Outlaw Star, but kicked up a notch. Everything has a kind of oriental/Star Wars Episode IV style to it (from people wearing old battle armor with cloaks over them to cities and transportation that looks like it's made of stuff found in a futuristic junk-yard).

As far as characters go, the main one in this show is mighty cool. Iria wears ceramic-looking body armor, carries a cool looking gun, and has more gadgets for fighting than you can shake a light-saber at. Of course if you are into sci-fi gadgetry there are also the speeder-type transports that can jump into hyper-space, personal energy shields, and the holographic fighting simulators (and we're just getting started). Cool stuff.

The fights in this show are great. Some people might get tired of seeing our hero fight the same villain for hours, but personally I loved it. The fights just get more and more intense, as the horrible creature called Zeiram simply refuses to die. During her fights with the monster, Iria will do all kinds of martial-arts moves, fire weapons until they run out of ammo and grab another one only to keep blasting, dodging, running, and doing all kinds acrobatics. Very slick.

Of course Iria herself is also an extremely likable person, and as we slowly learn more and more about her and how she came to be a hunter we come to care about her more and more. Iria may be tough-as-nails, and cool-as-ice, but in the end she's still a girl with a little bit of growing up to do, and she's not out to prove anything or hurt anyone, just to destroy the monster that threatens to kill everyone it comes close to. Iria is now officially one of my favorite anime heroes.

Really, the pacing of this anime is fantastic. It starts out at fast, and the tension just keeps building until by the end of the final episode we just know that either Iria or the monster is going to die. The desperation in the battle is palpable, and the viewer is on the edge of their seat. I love this anime. If you like action, you probably will too.",1099353600,22,2792,4.553784860557769
951233,5,6304913893,"Perfect 10.
Aliens, monsters, weapons, a young bounty hunter girl, and the song is cool.",1088121600,3,88,4.933333333333334
951294,5,6304913893,"At some time in the future a young woman named Iria and her brother Glen, both bounty hunters, join in an contract to rescue the passengers from the crash of a space transport.  This mission takes a turn for the worse when the rescue team find themselves face to face with an indestructible killer - Zeiram.  The result is disastrous; one team member killed, and Iria is forced to leave her brother behind to fight the monster.  For the rest of the episodes Iria dedicates herself to solving the mystery of the Zeiram and saving her brother.
Several things set this 1995 OVA series apart from female (or male, for that matter) heroic anime.  While the primary plot isn't entirely original the characters are notable and are allowed to develop well-crafted personalities.  Iria is young, intelligent, and fiercely capable - a completely independent woman.  Fujikuro is more than a little crooked, but, despite his antics, loyal to Iria.  Bob - a bounty hunter turned into a computer ghost.  And Kei, who is a younger reflection of Iria.  All of these characters and others leave lasting impressions as the result of the find scripting and conceptual work of Keita Amemiya.
The artwork remains outstanding even by today's standards.  The series is based on an original live action film, but animation can go where file can only follow at great cost.  Character design (Masakazu Katsura) and set design (Amemiya, et. al.) combine to provide a fresh looking universe that combines traditional Japanese and Chinese elements with fantasy visions that rival Yoshitaka Amano, peopled with contraptions that Da Vinci would have envied.
The set includes an additional DVD with graphics and interviews with Amemiya, Katsura and several of the voice actors.  If you are lucky enough to find the limited edition you will also get a metal container for the set.  This is another of those 'must see' that both stretch the boundaries of anime and provide great entertainment as well.",1083628800,36,1967,4.960365853658536
951295,4,6304913893,"To tell you the truth, this was not only the very first anime I owned, it was also the first one I saw. The story, the action, the characters and designs, all gloriously original. Anime about bounty hunters are nothing new, but Iria : The Zeiram Animation brought its own original twist to the sub genre. It is somewhat disappointing to only have six episodes, but once you own a few OVA's, it's more than enough. I bought the VHS back before DVD's were even around. The only reason that I hesitate to give it five stars is the English language track. It is littered with odd sounding phrases and seems to be poorly translated altogether. The voice acting is excellent, but marred by the odd translation. All in all, I highly suggest purchasing it. It is great for anyone starting a collection or just building upon their existing one.",1065484800,6,835,4.573333333333333
951296,4,6304913893,"The only problem with Iria is that I want another one. It's quite good, and I have to mention that it's a good title for women who like anime but who get weary of the 3-4 female archetypes so common in anime.
Here at last we have a strong female lead who has depth of character! More than almost any other female protagonist you're going to ever come across in anime... Add in good art, a solid story, great action and you're in good shape!
So where are the sequels!",1064880000,2,466,4.188888888888889
951297,5,6304913893,"Iria has to be one of my favorite animes of all time.  Considering it was how it was made in the early 1990s, it still has animation that is much better than what can be seen today.  Storyline and plot is pretty good.  Overall still a nostalgic favorite of mine.",1046217600,,262,4.2
951298,4,6304913893,"Iria has long been one of my favorite animes. The characters, locations, weapons, vehicles, and just about everything else are so uniquely designed it's incredible. They really put in the effort to create a truly unique sci-fi universe.
Iria is a young bounty hunter following in the footsteps of her older brother Gren. There's a big corporate cover-up going on and a deadly alien monster named Zeiram on the loose. I don't want to spoil the story so I'll keep the details brief.
The anime revolves around mystery and action. When things start to get too slow, a heavy dose of Iria's fighting abilities come into play. Iria's right up there with Armitage, Faye, and Motoko Kusanagi of Ghost in the Shell. Between her incredibly designed armor, Bond like gadgets, and fighting style, there's plenty to keep things fresh.
I absolutely love how they designed Iria. The hair, the weapons, the blue and white armor... it's all very cool. If you're not an Iria fan just by watching the opening then we've got different tastes. She has moves that would make Batman jealous and a good sense of humor to boot.
The music is really catchy... I always have the opening theme in my head for days after watching the movie. It's a really great song that truly fits with the style and theme of the animation.
This one's a good family anime. The message is good and the action is sure to keep everyone interested. There's a real brief shower scene in the full sub version though. It's not fan service, but brief nudity none the less.
The story itself is well told and will keep you guessing. There's plenty of twists and turns to keep things moving and interesting. All in all this is a great anime that has been a favorite of mine for many years now. Give it a shot if you like bounty hunters, female fighters, alien monster sci-fi, and/or mysteries.

The problem is this un-killable monster from outer space comes ""Zeiram"". To make a long story short it becomes a fight between Iria and Zeiram, with some strange things a long the way.

On the positive side, IRIA has some interesting character design and atypical elements of science fantasy. Plus the DVD is about 180 minutes long.
On the negative, IRIA is unengaging and more action than story or character based. I found myself bored, and quickly not caring what was going on.
There's nothing particularly special about the animation, though it does feature some nicer background paintings. Hold frames of IRIA are drawn better than most. IRIA pales in comparison to GHOST IN THE SHELL, ARMITAGE III, NINJA SCROLL, GIANT ROBO, and even THE BIG O, in my opinion.

Unfortunatly the characters are a little weak as is the plot. It has it's moments of brilliance. But not enough of them.

Some people found the kids annoying, which is strange, because I ALWAYS find kids annoying, and didn't find these to be so. I liked the music. I liked the animation. Iria is cool. Yeah it has mistakes, but c'est la vie. Know thyself--if you're like me and enjoy a lot of femme butt-kicking and futuristic settings, you'll like it.

First of all the animation was great, and the series was only six episodes long, so it can be watched in one evening.  Zeiram, the villan, was tough and practically unstopable, which is how a good anime villan should be.
The background music compliments the series well and at times gets stuck in your head throughout the day.  The series is light enough, in language that preteens could watch it w/o their perents freaking out.
The plot moves along at a quick pace and the action keeps you into the series.
To be fair, I will say that the dialouge dubbing could have been better, but after awhile you get used to the chopping converstaions.
Lets put it this way, Iria was meant to be an action stroy, not a character developing anime.  If you want character development, you may not like Iria, but if you want an action thrill ride with a lets shoot first and ask questions later attitude, then Iria should be to your liking.",992822400,4,1052,4.384615384615385

She is very hot headed and won't let anything get in her way when she wants to prove herself as a good bounty hunter. The movie itself has average animation quality, as well as sound and music.  There are several scenes which are rather classic animation humor, but for the most part the movie is pretty serious.  I recommend this animation movie to anyone ages 12 and up.",981331200,2,722,4.530769230769231

951392,2,6304913893,"This DVD kept coming up as a recommendation for me (presumably because Amazon's database knows I own Battle Angel and Akira), so I rented it first to see if it was worth the purchase. It wasn't, and I stopped watching after the 4th (of 6) episode because of boredom.
""Iria"" has clean, well-drawn animation (although I think there are a few too many pans of still frames -- too much like cheating) and some interesting concepts regarding the design of technology in the Iria universe. Unfortunately, there's nothing about the characters that makes you care much what happens to them (in fact, the children are so annoying that you sometimes wish that either Iria or Zeiram _would_ get rid of them). Zeiram, for all that he seems indestructible and omnipotent, never seems particularly menacing.
The plot and character development of this DVD don't come anywhere near the quality of Battle Angel (a much better story about a female bounty hunter), Akira, Dagger of Kamui, or any of the standard ""must-haves"" in this genre. Like one of the previous reviewers, I give Iria an extra star because of the quality of the animation and the originality of some of the designs.",979862400,5,1166,4.835

However, you would be mislead if you expect a feature film quality production from this DVD.  The music is poor, the action is simple, the look and detail of the backgrounds is a bit shallow and the pasing gets really slow at times.
The best context for this DVD is as an ok TV Series, but it is certainly not ""Ghost in the Shell"", it is not ""Princess Mononoke"", it is not ""Ninja Scroll"", and it is certainly not ""Akira"".  So don't raise your expectations of ""Iria"" to the level of any of these films.",979344000,3,612,4.258620689655173

The story itself was very shallow.  With plot and pace being so lack luster, it becomes easy to overlook the outstanding  job of animation.

951457,1,6304913893,"""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"" is a thriller/horror/sci-fi. It concerns Iria, who must slay the evil Zeriam. The two terrifying conflicts  this anime provides are A) a fantastic enemy, and B) waiting for this  worthless piece of garbage to end. Plauged by poor writing, unbelievible  fight sequences, and more, Zeriam is better left alone.
Its stars Iria,  the younger sibling of her big brother, Gren. Iria admires Gren greatly.  She follows him around, assisting him in his bounty hunting job.
The  anime starts with Iria saving three girls from a criminal. Before she nabs  the criminal, however, a rival of Iria's flys down and grabs him, claiming  the bounty for himself. Iria travels back to her brother, and he tells her  that he has to board and investigate the ""Karma"", a ship that has  been hijacked by an unknown assailant. Gren must hurry, however, becuase he  must rescue the few survivors before the authorities arrive.
But when  Gren, Iria, and Grens companion, Bob arrive at the ship, they find more  than they bargained for: a indistructible demon-like beast called Zeiram  that is hellbent on killing Bob, Gren and Iria.
I""ll start with the  good stuff first, The animation and art quality. The art quality is  great. Many of the mecha and set designs have a decidedly  turn-of-the-century Chinese/Japanese design and feel, and it looks very  interesting. Character designs are above average. Uniquely drawn, Iria  looks perfect as the gun-happy heroine of the series. However, her  personalitie seems completly lifted from a Masamune Shirow work. Her friend  Kei looks very sterotypical, with his sling-shot and spikey  hair.
Frame-rates are exceptional, and do not hinder the detail of the  drawings. Zeriam himself had a frightening design. Big and tall, Zeriam has  a black blob where his head should be. The blob has a face on it that looks  like a pale mask, and the face can strech out at his foes.
Now the bad.  The story is uninspired and boring, and many of the key plot elements seem  to have been completely lifted from ""Alien"". In addition, viewers  are forced to withstand chessy plot cliche's.
It seemed as if the  boundries and rules set in the universe of ""Iria: Zeiram the  Animation"" where constantly forgotten, and gave ""Iria: Zeiram the  Animation"" a unbelevable feeling. For example, Zeriam survives a  explosion the size of a atom bomb and hundereds of bullets, yet a rising  kick or a rock from a sling-shot stop him in his tracks. Even the  characters behaved in unnatural ways. For example, Iria idolizes her  brother, yet he dies, and she carelessly takes a nap. Completely  emotionless.
Being a horror title, one can expect some violence. In the  first episode, Bob is getting torn apart by Zeriam while Iria is having a  calm conversation with someone else. Unfortunatly, ""Iria: Zeiram the  Animation"" tends to have unnesscary scenes in which tons of children  are shot down by Zeriam.
All in all, ""Iria: Zeiram the  Animation"" is overrated story that is deprived of good storytelling,  characterazation, and lack of realism. It's not even fun to watch.
If  you are looking for a good cyberpunk with a good story, ""Battle  Angel"" or ""Ghost in a Shell"" would be good choices.  Or if  you want a anime high in entertainment value, try ""Plastic  Little"". ""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"" is unpleasant.",965865600,12,3340,4.935135135135135
951458,2,6304913893,"The final evaluation of this DVD is that the story  is not ""finished"", just like a first draft. With a bit more work and less ustilization of ""jumps into back episodes"" to reuse the  animations and make some extra time, it would be much better.",963187200,,244,4.4

951460,5,6304913893,"First of all, I'd like to thank Pioneer for including all six episodes of Iria in one DVD, because they prove it can be done (other companies decide to put only three or four eps per DVD, whereas they can fit plenty  more).
The movie is excellent, surpassed only by, perhaps, Ghost in the  Shell. A story of a bounty hunter named Iria, and her brother Gren, and the  mysterious, immortal monster, Zeiram.
The movie includes great animation,  storyline, action, and other blockbuster elements. The one downside of the  series was the ending that ended abruptly. I have found an answer why  however (and this is to answer all those reviews that gave Iria a lowsy  rating because of the ending). I have found rumors that a second Iria movie  is in the works, but don't count on it, because these are only rumors from  various websites.

951461,4,6304913893,This animation is a strange anime for several reasons. Firstly the animation is up to the standard of some Manga productions. It is clear and well realised. The story is strong in that the villan is far more  interesting than the heroine. Iria is a bounty hunter who is caught up in  tracking the creature 'Zieram'. There follows a complicated tale of her  adventures that are frequently inter-spersed with flashbacks. However the  real star of the show is Zieram who proves more than a match for anything  that it comes up against (It absorbs there DNA thus making itself  stronger). The music is good and the dubbing is fair. Overall it should  appeal to science fiction fans as well as those who enjoy a blockbuster  type animation.,951177600,6,735,4.732283464566929

As for the plot, it keeps from being tedious, but  suffers a little predictability closer to the end (But hey, it's an anime,  right?). Still, the story is upbeat, with interesting characters and an  even more interesting handful of settings. The world Iria seems to show is  so weird and complicated, that it can't be helped but seem so believeable.  Sort of like a blend of Ancient Chinese Dynasty with some organic  machinery. Another plus to this is the awesome action and quite possibly  the coolest villain in all of anime...ZEIRAM. A definite pick and also one  of my favorite animes.",947289600,13,757,4.681818181818182

7881013,4,6304913893,"When you sit Iria: Zeiram the Animation right beside the Zeiram films it's not a perfect fit. When you sit Iria on its own merits you get a better production. Iria is an anime series that is set many years before the first Zeiram movie (or Zeram on the U.S. release). It builds a world very different from the movies, which is where disconnect comes from. However this setting is rife with its own charm and fascination. While it tends to fall under some standard anime tropes and stereotypes all in all the series is a worthwhile viewing for both anime and science fiction fans.

The story is about Iria just before she gains the status as a hunter and is still wet behind the ears. She loses her brother after a rescue mission goes wrong with the release of the deadly Zeiram. Throughout the six episodes Iria uncovers plots and grows in her combat prowess before having a final showdown with the monster. As I said before if you stand this series alone from the movie that came before it you get a well rounded anime with a fascinating monster and lots of interesting weapons and technology. However when you tie it in with the movie there are discrepancies, but lets look at how it stands on its own.

I am a fan of intricate world building, and there are some incredible worlds built in some animes. iria is right up there with them. The costumes are a high tech feudal Japan style with kimonos mixing future and past with color and flair. The vehicles seem to use wagasa/parasols in their means to float above the ground in some high tech-meets ancient style. The weapons... oh man the weapons are plentiful with various capabilities. Iria still has her signature pistol from the movie, but also a long rifle, a sword that starts off like a whip (like Ivy from Soul Caliber), propeller looking explosives, and more. Then you have massively powerful rifles, missile launchers and stuff that has an old tech feel mixed in. Then you have this awesome stasis technology similar to the movie, and the Transembler network that practically teleports everybody to where they need to go without using spacecraft. If you love seeing stylish technology and lots of cool stuff that goes bang this series has what you're looking for.

Then of course is Zeiram. This series does a lot to explain much of what this creature is about. While it doesn't give away all the secrets you can really get a better handle on who, or what Zeiram is. This all plays well into the story arc and how more is revealed throughout the series. As I said before as a standalone series there is a lot going good here. There is a certain level of violence that never gets graphic, but lots of people do die.  On the other hand this anime series fall into the same trappings that many animes did at this time with lengthy theme songs, sophomoric conversations and banter, child characters getting into all sorts of mischief. And there is your standard naked shower scene as well. The animation and production feel a little bit dated, but that could just be me thinking about movies like Ghost in the Shell that were made near that time.

Still I am a sticker for continuity, and if this show is supposed to be in the same universe as the first Zeiram movie then there are issues. Aesthetically the two are very different. The uniqueness of Iria is in sharp contrast to the practical technologies and stylings found in the first film. While I admit the two can still coexist it is a pretty jarring difference. Iria the character feels very different from the movie as well. Sure this is her years younger, but again the differences are enough to make them feel very apart from each other. The one thing that sticks to my craw the most is what I consider a serious plot hole in the entire series. Iria in the Zeiram movie meets the monster for the first time on the film, but according to this series not only has she faced off with the monster before, she should have a much stronger working knowledge of how to defeat the monster. It really flies in the fact of continuity for me.

You get all six episodes on two DVD disks. They look really great on a upscaled DVD player. The audio is crisp on the English dolby stereo track... maybe even better than previous releases. I didn't listen to the Japanese Dolby 5.1 surround track, but I'm sure it's a superior mix to the English dub. The extras include:

Video Interviews:  Vintage interviews with creator Keita Amemiya and designer Masakazu Katsura. Amemiya's interview is interesting in that he talks about how Zeiram came to be and the tie in to the anime. Katsura's interview was mostly him talking about how he wasn't that involved in the production and that is was pretty much just another job to him.

VA Interviews: Text interviews with Japanese voice actors Aya Hisakawa (Iria) and Mika Kanai (Kei). You get their opinions on working with the series and a few experiences they had during it. Actually not bad reading if you're a fan.

Sing Along: The title song (not the pop one.. the one before that) done karaoke style. In other words filler.

Art Galleries: This is a very short collection of images broken down into categories (Characters, Production and Concepts). There is some good stuff here and some pretty generic art too. Nowhere near enough to satisfy anybody who wants to see this sort of thing.

Personally I cannot call this a prequel to the Zeiram movie. It deviates a bit too much from the established lore. However I can call it a stylish and fascinating anime series that is well worth a look.",1438732800,,5539,4.583838383838384
