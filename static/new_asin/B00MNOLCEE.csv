8673212,5,B00MNOLCEE,"In spite of leaning somewhat towards LDS beliefs, this is a very well presented documentary on near death experiences/phenomenon. The people who were interviewed told compelling stories regarding their NDE and were interesting to hear. While they incorperated some religion into the documentary they also presented the scientific views/opinions as well. Very well done overall, and I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in NDE studies.",1444003200,3,446,5.6716417910447765
