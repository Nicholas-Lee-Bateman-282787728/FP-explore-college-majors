5564693,4,B00B9LNPH4,"I was very happy to hear that volume 3 of the first season of Digimon was finally released. When I went summer shopping at ******* I saw it for $12 and picked it up. I took it home and opened the package. There were 3 DVDs inside each with only 5 episodes on each. First thing I thought was ""okay why only 5 episodes on each?"" If I bought the big boxset here for $36 I would only have 8 DVDs which means this final volume would've been on 2 DVDs instead. So why did they make it 3 discs instead? Well why they did that I don't know. Also while I was watching disc 2 one of the episodes glitched and suddenly the audio was badly out of sync. I started thinking maybe its my player. Nope the whole episode was out of sync. I don't remember what the episode is but it's the 2nd one on disc 2. So my review is 4/5 stars. Heres my reasons: 1st the episode was bad sync, 2. after looking at all my volume discs not all the digidestened got a disc picture, and 3. The video on the first 2 episodes was very bad quality. but all in all I'm happy that Digimon is finally on DVD.",1369008000,,1069,3.9537037037037037

8564715,1,B00B9LNPH4,"Disc 2 of this set on Episode 46, it has the video going a half-second ahead of the audio. I don't know if the official season set was like that on its Disc 7, but this is a major screw-up that Flatiron didn't realise. The product from secondspin arrived in one piece, and the discs are good, it's just Flatiron and this screw-up. Hope your season set didn't have this, but it may not.",1514851200,,385,4.216216216216216
