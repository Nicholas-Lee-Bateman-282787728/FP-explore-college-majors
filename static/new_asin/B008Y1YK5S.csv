5189945,1,B008Y1YK5S,This is too graphic with stabbing & blood to be a made for television movie!  We don't need all that - just to see what led to it; not to see the act throughout the movie! I didn't even finish it.  Terrible & depressing movie!,1372464000,,226,4.0
5189946,3,B008Y1YK5S,"Blue-Eyed Butcher, 2012 film

The story begins with a trial. Susan Wright murdered her husband rather than divorce him. [Divorce could mean a 50-50 split of assets, a death meant the widow got all.] People on the beach play volley-ball. Susan meets Jeffrey Wright. She was studying to become a nurse; she worked as an exotic dancer for a few months. They date. Susan goes to Jeff's place. Did she trap him? They marry. Did this change Jeff for the better? In court Susan tells how she stabbed him. The testimony brings out more details about their lives: marriage, the birth of a son. But Jeff forgets to come home after work. What is happening to them? Susan talks about their sex life. She decides to go back to school - at night. Jeff dislikes this decision. Was she beaten by Jeff? No doctor visit? Jeff works out at a gym.

There is a separation, then they come together. Jeff threatens Susan. There is a second child. Susan keeps a clean home. Then Susan finds unpaid bills. Her credit card is declined at a store. Susan cooks a meal, Jeff rejects this. Is it an illusion to believe that beauty is goodness? The crime is recreated in court. The Medical Examiner testifies in court, stabbed 193 times, a painful death. Then the body was dragged outside and put into a hole. Susan claimed Jeff left her . She tries to clean up the bloodstains (after they dried) and dump the bloody mattress. Did she remember the details? She explains Jeff's absence"" ""he left"". Her lawyer takes her to a psychiatrist to tell her story. The police dig up the body and gather the evidence. Susan is charge with murder. Later she holds a yard sale! Jeff had a big life insurance policy. Will she testify in court? The jury comes to a decision: guilty, given 25 years. Will she get a new trial? Her sentence was reduced by five years, she will be out in 2014,

Was this story a warning about marrying someone that they know little about? A problem for big city dwellers that doesn't occur in small towns when most people lived for years.",1369699200,,2021,4.501362397820164

5189956,1,B008Y1YK5S,"This is NOT worth to purchase as a collection. The writing is stale. There is no dimension in either character. No true build up. Cheap thrills. This movie is easily acceptable for ages 20 to early 30. The casting is the best that they could do. ""Untouchable"" was a LOT better of a movie and that Jodi Arias movie was a LOT better to have in a collection than this one. The actor who plays Susan Wright does not emote empathy and Jeffery Wright's character goes from 0 to 100. There is no build up. And why on earth are they advertising ""how beautiful"" she is. Almost every character in this film has to remind the audience of ""how beautiful"" she is. It was obsessively repeated as if we needed to be convinced of her beauty and I have noticed that many of the LMN productions  promote how beautiful the main female characters are and then pairing her up with some one over weight with short hair to make sure that the point is driven home to us, She was ""okay"" but not ""beautiful.""The REAL Susan Wright was not even a true blond, over her time in prison her blonde returns to a mousy brown.. It is a cheap LMN movie shot and the writing is elementary. It may be worth a guilty pleasure of a curiosity to watch it on cable, but NEVER to purchase. The performances aren't as memorable and the arc has a very generic formula. The writing does not truly honour the court transcripts at all. They could have taken the time to cast evolved characters to bring in the depth, other wise, it just isn't worth the purchase. It is not a great film. I'd wager that the other comments are strictly based on age content of not knowing what a truly solid docudrama stands for. A disappointment from LMN as usual. Stand for quality and please do not spend money when it isn't something watchable again and again. Thank you.",1431734400,2,1808,4.380952380952381

8532269,3,B008Y1YK5S,"BLUE-EYED BUTCHER is the shocking true story of a wife and mother driven to kill by her abusive husband, starring Sara Paxton (The Innkeepers), Justin Bruening (TVs Ringer) and Lisa Edelstein (TVs The Good Wife). Susan (Paxton) met handsome salesman Jeff (Bruening) on vacation and their storybook romance quickly led to marriage and a family. But Jeffs drug use, immaturity and explosive temper led to violent episodes with Susan and their kids. Pushed to the very edge, she tied up her husband and stabbed him in their bed. Was she a battered prisoner of her suburban home or as the tough-as-nails prosecutor (Edelstein) argued, a calculating, cold-blooded murderer?",1504828800,,668,5.194444444444445
