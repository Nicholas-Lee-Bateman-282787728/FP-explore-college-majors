8155693,5,B000KDIKBS,"This is one of the best urban stand up comedy collaboration ever. Each act Is funnier than the last with the fantastically funny Earthquake hosting. But there is one stand out star, an unknown comedian Joe Blount who will have you spitting with laughter. His style of comedy is so unique and insightful, you'll find yourself searching for more material on him, unfortunately you won't find much. But his act, I will guarantee you will watch again and again and always find it outrageously funny. This video is a gem. I have bought it twice and lent them out; never to be seen again. This copy will stay in my possession.",1381536000,,620,4.594594594594595
