7906798,5,B00000F589,"National Geographic's ""Search for the Great Apes"" offers rare, on-site footage of the research projects of Birute Galdikas in Borneo and Dian Fossey in the misty Virunga Mountains on the border of Rwanda and Zaire.  As partial sponsors of the research of both of these women, who also received funding from the Leakey Foundation, National Geographic has long been dedicated to educating the public and protecting these apes and their environment.  This 1975 video sometimes has the look and feel of a charming home movie, but it makes the work of these researchers feel very real and intimate, and their remarkable interactions with these great apes become personally involving.

Birute Galdikas's project in Borneo, begun in 1971, was to find and study the orangutan (""the man of the forest""), a primate species that is solitary and independent and, as far as zoologists knew, spent almost all of its time in trees.  Her secondary project was to provide a refuge where orphaned baby orangutans could be cared for, taught how to survive, and later released safely into the wild.  Though Galdikas has never received the widespread publicity of Fossey and Jane Goodall, the other ""Leakey's ladies,"" her dedication to the orangutans and the difficulties of studying animals who are solitary, make this footage of her work especially memorable and important.

Few who see her working with the big-eyed orphan babies will fail to see the similarity to a nursery school, and the footage as she tries to eat a meal surrounded by baby orangutans is eye-opening.  Major research breakthroughs are also highlighted here.  For those who are interested in her work, Galdikas's book, Reflections of Eden, is the most literary of the books written by the well known primate researchers--filled with fascinating descriptions and sometimes lyrical passages.

The original films of the controversial Dian Fossey, whose work with the mountain gorilla is by now well known, show her following gorilla groups, imitating them in order to make them less fearful, and eventually recording the population and their behavior, using their noseprints (as different as fingerprints) to distinguish them.  She introduces the viewer to the famous ""Uncle Bert"" and Digit, her two most important subjects, and interacts with them.  Though an epilogue, added in 1989, mentions that Fossey was murdered in December, 1985, ""probably by poachers,"" the video emphasizes her important discoveries and says nothing about her personal difficulties.  The reader looking for a more information about Fossey may want to read Farley Mowat's book, Woman in the Mists.  Mary Whipple",1120953600,,2636,5.262529832935561
