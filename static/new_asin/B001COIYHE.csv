8288497,3,B001COIYHE,"Note where Bible scholars interviewed for the program say, ""Jesus would have represented a kind of activist and resister in Pontius Pilate's experience that he had been dealing with for years, and with varying degrees of success and effectiveness, obviously. Jesus would have been a blip on the screen of Pontius Pilate, because the unrest and the uprisings were so common, part of daily life for the Roman administration of Judea, that Jesus would have been seen, I think, as very little out of the ordinary.""

and

""Now I don't for a moment think that Pilate would have been worried that Jesus could have challenged the power of the emperor. That's not the point. The point is, any challenge to Roman authority...any challenge to the peace of Rome would have been met with a swift and violent response.""

This confirms Josephus' accounts as to what immediately happened to any person claiming to perform miracles in Roman Judea.

Between 44 and 46 CE, one Theudas caused some consternation with what may have been a claim to be the Messiah:

""It came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain charlatan, whose name was Theudas, persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon them unexpectedly, they slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem."" -- [(Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98]

and

The Roman governor Festus, who was -according to recent research- in office from 58 until 60 CE, was confronted with another rebel:

""Festus sent forces, both horsemen and footmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness. Accordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also."" -- [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.188]

Yet the Bible scholars interviewed for this PBS Frontline program fail to explain why Pontius Pilate failed for three years to swiftly deal with the threat of Jesus when if it had been anyone other than Jesus, that threat to the Roman Peace would have been immediately  dealt with three years earlier (see first embedded comment, and in the link provided fast-forward to 37:45 minutes in Part I of ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"" for another Biblical scholar's account of how Roman governors in Judea IMMEDIATELY reacted towards PEACEFUL ""Messiahs"")!

The PBS Frontline program also fails to explain the similar three-year inaction of the religious leaders in Jerusalem (and Galilee/Perea) to execute Jesus for blasphemy under the Law of Moses, AND why for the next 37 years (before the fall of Jerusalem) Roman and Jewish religious authorities are still refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples and all Jesus Sect members (excepting for three fluke cases: Saint Stephen and the two disciples named James. In the case of Saint Stephen, he was pointed out to the religious leaders of Jerusalem by foreign Jews from what is today Turkey, who were in town for Passover. The religious leaders of Jerusalem were pressed into the arrest and stoning of Stephen by ignorant foreign Jews, otherwise Stephen would not have been arrested in the first place. See my first embedded comment to this review for how the two disciples named James died.)!

In fact, in Acts 4:4 and Acts 5:18, the disciples were arrested twice by the Sanhedrin before the death of Stephen. Inexplicably, in both instances the Sanhedrin merely warned the disciples to keep their tongues quiet about Jesus, then released them!

Note too that during Paul's three-year ""persecution"" of Jesus Sect members (33-36 AD), no real persecution is actually taking place in Judea (or Galilee for that matter, since the disciples are moving freely from Galilee to Judea and back), which must of exasperated the newly minted Pharisee. Obviously perplexed, and attempting to ""impress"" his superiors, Paul asks (see Acts 9) for a persecution mission to the gentile city of Damascus.

Now the gentile rulers of the ""independent"" city states of Decapolis (where Damascus is located) didn't allow for the extradition of Jesus Sect subjects to Judea for stoning, so Paul is being sent on a wild goose mission and doesn't know it! In fact, it was on one such wild goose mission (to Damascus) that Jesus had enough with Paul and threw him off his high horse of ignorance. Jesus says to Paul, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" Note, Jesus only says this to the obstinate Paul. Jesus doesn't have to tell anyone else to cease persecuting his flock because no one else in Judea is! I bet you never thought about that?

In fact, when Paul and Peter, and their disciples, are roaming the eastern Roman Empire (outside of the Levant) they too are attracting large crowds, and what are the Roman governors doing about this sedition? Nothing. As with the ten Roman governors of Judea, they too refuse to immediately arrest Paul and Peter (and their disciples), then adjudicating and executing them for sedition.

The Christian interpretation followed for 2,000 years on this subject is in such egregious and obvious error, that it is a true miracle that it wasn't debunked until now! Roman authorities and Jewish authorities KNEW Jesus was the Messiah, otherwise actions against Jesus (and after Jesus' death and resurrection) would have been immediate and violent for all Jesus Sect members involved.

In fact, John 11 (45-55) implicitly tells us that long before Passion Week the priestly leadership of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah (how Christian theists missed this eye-opening passage from John is beyond explanation!):

""45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.

""What are we accomplishing?"" they asked. ""Here is this man performing many signs. 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.""

49 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, ""You know nothing at all! 50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.""

51 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

54 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.

55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 56 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, ""What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?"" 57 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.""

See where the High Priest Caiaphas tells his underlings, ""You know nothing at all!""? Caiaphas knows who Jesus is because the intelligence network he has within the Jesus camp (Rome and Herod Antipas also have their intelligence networks within the Jesus Sect camp, and the agents are reporting that Jesus is unlike the other deluded ""prophets"" they've dealt with before, that Jesus is really bringing back to life persons known to be dead and performing other miracles) is affirming that Jesus is the Messiah.

Note the inexplicable description Caiaphas makes about Jesus: ""...he [Caiaphas] prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.""

Now, if Jesus was merely considered by Caiaphas to be a deluded blaspheming ""Prophet"", then when Jesus died, that was it. Jesus would be forgotten. But notice, Caiaphas says about what Jesus' death would bring about, ""...that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one."" A deluded Jesus would die for blasphemy, not ""die for the Jewish nation"" as Caiaphas says.

In other words, Caiaphas not only knew who Jesus was, he knew what Jesus was up to otherwise he would never have made such a blasphemous comment himself about Jesus' death ""bring[ing] them [the Jewish nation] together and make them one."" However, note that Caiaphas is under the misapprehension of Jesus' true mission, which is to die for man's sins. Caiaphas is still operating under the original Covenant God made with man (with the Jews), so he thinks Jesus's death will reconstitute an independent Israel.

Now, the next week was Passion Sunday. What happened on Passion Sunday? Jesus arrives in Jerusalem with a large mob. This action was a direct attack on Roman rule in Judea, which put into motion Caiaphas' and Jesus' plan that Jesus must die.

Also note Caiaphas' worries about Rome. Caiaphas would have been counting his blessings that Prefect Pontius Pilate hadn't already long ago arrested and executed Jesus for ""rebellion"". Caiaphas must have known though that it wasn't just three-years good luck that kept Pilate from doing his duty and arrest and execute Jesus, but that Pilate too obviously knew who Jesus was. But how long could Caiaphas expect Pilate to avert his eyes from Jesus' provocations? Caiaphas had to act, and the Passion Sunday procession was the obvious sign from God that it was time for Jesus to die.

This passage from John's Gospel proves that Jewish religious authorities in Judea and Galilee (especially the high ranking authorities) knew who Jesus was.

Another proof that the religious leaders of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah, and had no intention themselves of killing Him, was their failure to also arrest His disciples at Gethsemane. In order to operationalize Jesus' mission (as the religious leaders saw it) on Eathh, only the arrest of Jesus was necessary; His death would come at the hands of Pilate, not them, as proved by the three extralegal ""trials"" to come, proceedings that ruled out any form of punishment under the Law of Moses (Under the Law of Moses, trials could only take place later, during daylight hours.).

This explains why John the Baptist refused to ministry in Judea, and ministry only in Antipas' jurisdiction of Perea (in order to question John, the Elders of Jerusalem had to travel to Perea to do so, because John refused to cross the Jordan River and enter Roman territory). Because John (although born in Judea) knew what would happen to him once he crossed the border into Judea with his disciples and followers: Arrest and execution by Roman authorities, yet Jesus was allowed by Pilate to come and go as He pleased!

Since John the Baptist was preaching the Old Testament in Perea (Antipas' jurisdiction), there was no cause to arrest John for blasphemy and leading Jews astray. John was only arrested and executed by Antipas when John specifically railed against Antipas' marriage to his dead brother's wife, who was also his niece.

The Gospels' narrative is so ludicrous, so obviously a forged narrative, a badly forged infantile narrative, that the only way it would have been accepted as true by anyone at the time of its release is if the narrative was known to be true already!

The Gospels' narrative was known true, otherwise there would be no Christianity today.

Let's perform a modern times analogy with the Roman Empire using a post World War II scenario where Germany won the war and rules the Western hemisphere:

Germany has won World War II, and German governors rule the Western hemisphere, the Waffen SS being the equivalent of the Roman centurion.

Though the war is over resistance to German occupation continues, including the French Resistance.

Now, in France the leader of the French resistance and twelve lieutenants move openly about France for three years preaching rebellion and the German governor does nothing. After three years the leader of the French Resistance enters Paris with his twelve lieutenants and a mob and again the German governor refuses to arrest the thirteen, and roundup the mob.

Finally the French mayor of Paris arrests the leader, but not the twelve lieutenants, and hands the leader over to the German governor who still doesn't want to execute the leader, but does after left no other option.

Now, after the leader of the French Resistance is dead not only are the twelve lieutenants allowed to live under that particular German governor's remaining term of office, but aren't touched by the next nine German governors to take office. In fact, the French Resistance is increasing by tens of thousands each year and German authorities simply sit by and watch.

Now when one of those French Resistance travels outside France to spread the word of the rebellion in France, he is believed because everyone KNOWS the otherwise ludicrous story he's telling is true. END OF ANALOGY.

Now you can appreciate the reactions of any Roman subject when confronted with the Gospels' narrative of how Jesus and His disciples were treated by both Jewish and Roman authorities: Unbelievable, unless known to be true!

You see, the New Testament narrative also has the next 9 Roman governors after Pilate also inexplicably refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples who are still performing ""rebellious"" miracles (others too besides the disciples are performing ""rebellious"" miracles) and attracting large crowds. The Jewish leaders are doing the same...actually protecting the Jesus Sect, where the sect is now tens of thousands strong in Jerusalem alone by the time of Paul's third trip back to the city in 61 AD (the original Greek texts says ""ten of thousands"", not ""thousands"". New Testament translators couldn't believe the high number, so they removed a zero!).

The Gospels' failure to account for the inexplicable behaviors on the part of officials allowing Jesus to live three years beyond which others would have met their deaths, and equally inexplicable failure to destroy the Jesus Sect for the next thirty-seven years before the fall of Jerusalem, is understandable when one observes the precarious situation the new Jesus Sect found itself in. To openly proclaim in the Gospels and other books that found their way into the New Testament that Jewish (and Roman) officials knew Jesus was the Messiah would have forced those officials into actually persecuting the Jesus Sect in order to deflect such claims made in Jesus Sect literature. In other words, for forty years there was a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy towards the Jesus Sect!

In closing, I would like to clear an issue that has perplexed New Testament scholarship for close to a century now, and that is the Testimonium Flavianum, the name given to the passage found in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the ""Antiquities of the Jews"", in which the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities, specifically referring to Jesus with the following, ""He was [the] Christ.""

It is this reference to Jesus as being ""the Christ"" (Messiah) that troubles New Testament scholars since we are told by the early Church Father Origen in his Commentary on Matthew (Book X, Chapter 17) that Josephus did not accept Jesus as Christ. Well, as my research above proves, Jewish officials in Judea and elsewhere did indeed believe Jesus to be the Messiah, though for political reasons kept that belief close to themselves.

Josephus' family was wealthy, and his his father came from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Therefore, Josephus would have been well aware of the intelligence reports the Sanhedrin received concerning Jesus' true nature, hence there would be no conflict with Josephus not only accepting Jesus as the Messiah, but knowing Jesus was the Messiah.

Christian apologetics is finally dead.
