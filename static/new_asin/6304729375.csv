927635,4,6304729375,"Enjoyed by the kids who are 3, 6 and 9.  Not so much by the adults.  Story line and acting leave a lot to be desired.  And, this is an old movie.",1455926400,,145,3.46875
927636,5,6304729375,"""Night of the Living Dummy III"" is a sequel to ""Night of the Living Dummy II"" found on the Night of the Living Dummy DVD. This is my favorite Goosebumps episode, along with ""Welcome to Dead House"" and ""The Haunted Mask"".  In this episode, Trina and Dan aren't to happy about there cousin, Zane, coming to visit them for two weeks. But when their dad buys a new ventriloquist dummy named Slappy, a series of strange pranks begin to happen, and Zane always seems to be the target. When Trina and Dan find out that Zane is pulling the tricks, things turn back to normal. Accept when the dummy automatically appears on the table.  This is a great addition to my Goosebumps collection!",1453852800,,680,4.520325203252033

927684,5,6304729375,"Night of the Living Dummy III is my most requested repeat showing of the Goosebumps movies we watch in my middle school classroom. This is my go-to film when my class needs a reward or we are studying suspense in literature. It has the bonus of being both funny and genuinely creepy at the same time. Recently when a substitute teacher was left with a difficult 6th grade class and no lesson plans, this film literally saved the day for her. I highly endorse this one, but I would not show it to lower grades. I also have high school students who are entertained by this film. It delivers.",1369526400,,589,4.412844036697248

927693,3,6304729375,"This does have a much better story than the last NOTLD but you can feel the story dragging itself in this one, much like it does with his Goosebumps Mummy series. Its not fun to read, which is a real surprise from stine (unless you read his new series, in which you shouldn't be surprised at all). I personally would suggest you get the first book and forget the others.",1313366400,,370,4.3
927752,5,6304729375,"Well, what can I say. I think this along with the Haunted Mask 2 and Welcome to Dead House were my favorite Goosebumps episodes.

927753,5,6304729375,"This movie is hilarious but kind of scary. Mostly funny though and it's goosebump's best. Very suspenseful for first time watchers. Hilarious, if you're looking for a good laugh, watch this. I laugh at almost everything Slappy says. Even his voice is funny! Get the DVD instead of the VHS though because DVDs are easier to handle. And you can never really fully trust a VCR, they always eat tapes =[",1194134400,,399,4.633802816901408
927754,5,6304729375,"This would have to be my favorite Goosebumps movie yet, and i've seen a lot of the movies. But what I don't get is that in the movies slappy has red hair and eyebrows, but in the books he has black hair and eyebrows. And what I also don't get is that Night of the living dummy 3 and Bride of the living dummy don't go together. Because in Night of the livng dummy 3 Slappy gets shocked by lightning and explodes, but in Bride of the living dummy he's completeley unharmed. I liked the part on Night of the living dummy 3 at the end when Rocky the dummy beats up Slappy and throws him out the window. So the movie is great, funny, and scary. Also see these movies, Bride of the livng dummy & Night of the living dummy 2",1172275200,5,718,4.027972027972028
927755,5,6304729375,This is a real wonderful movie for kids and almost every kid wants to see a scary movie but to scared but this is a scary kids movie. Even some kids might like it because they love the books. The dummy Slappy is not a normal dummy. It walks at. It stalks your every move. It watches you DAY & NIGHT!,1154736000,3,299,3.918032786885246
927756,3,6304729375,"This is the second episode about Slappy. It's kinda good and kinda crappy, but mostly so-so. Even though the acting sucks, the story is terrible and the ending's real corny and it dosen't show Slappy much, I still suggest it to anyone.",1124323200,,235,4.619047619047619
927757,5,6304729375,"This is such a FUNNY movie!!!! I LOVE the part when Rocky beats up Slappy and says ""Never go against the family"". That was just TOO funny! I LOVED the part when Slappy is chasing the kids to the livingroom and when the one kid opens the recliner chair and when it opens it hits Slappy and he goes flying!!! This movie is SOOOOO funny!

927811,4,6304729375,"This isn't exactly a review for this particular movie, but all of them in one review. They are all good, but not for kids under 6 I used to be afraid of them. They are all good I just gave it that many stars because there are not enough shows on vhs let alone none on dvd! Because I know there were more episodes then just those 10. They should put out The Phantom of the Auditorium (Look at my review of The Phantom of the Opera 1925 and '29 dvd) or The Day I learned to fly or, The Headless Ghost(I think It's called).

927813,5,6304729375,"when I first saw this I was surprized. Surprized with fear. I never thought that night of the living dummy 3 was so scary. Slappy was scary and boosy just like in the book. But I had thought that more that one dummy would be brought to life not just one[Rocky or Rocko].I loved the part were Slappy propped himself up on the table then Zane told him to kick him and Slappy did,but after Zane turned around.""YOU DIDN'T SAY PLEASE AND SO THEY WANT TO PLAY PRANKS ON EACH OTHER"",are my favorite lines that Slappy had said.",1072310400,2,519,4.3061224489795915

And one with a sneer just like SLAPPY.Trina and her brother,Dan,think SLAPPY is pretty cool. But now there are voices in the attic. And SLAPPY keeps showing up in the strangest places.

7877491,5,6304729375,"Slappy walks like he has no bones! In the movie, his head bobbles, and his legs make thumping sounds! In the beginning, slappy's head is cracked open, but Trina and Daniel's dad glues it together! I think its a sequal after night of the living dummy 2! Because at the end of that movie, slappys head cracked open, but at the end of the 3rd movie, slappy gets struck by lightning and explodes! Dad thinks Zane is a wus, and he thinks whoever did Zane's voice in the movie also did Anakin skywalker's voice in Star wars! Who cares?
