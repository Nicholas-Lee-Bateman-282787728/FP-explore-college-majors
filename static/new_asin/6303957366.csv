7858610,3,6303957366,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1989 and directed by Bill Bixby, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk is the second of three movies in the wake of the TV series that ran from 1977-82.

PLOT AND MAIN CAST: Drifter David Banner (Bill Bixby) is held as a suspect in a crime connected to the Kingpin, Wilson Fisk (John Rhys-Davies), but is helped by blind lawyer, Matt Murdock (Rex Smith), who knows hes telling the truth and just so happens to be the masked crime-fighter Daredevil. Lou Ferrigno plays the jade giant while Nancy Everhard appears as Murdocks office associate. Marta DuBois plays the crime victim manipulated by the Kingpin.

This one isn't as good as the previous The Incredible Hulk Returns (1988) because its hard to beat Eric Allan Kramers charismatic performance as Thor. The way Daredevil is depicted in his first appearance on the screen is pretty faithful to the comics (a mix of Stan Lees original version with Frank Millers  early 80s version), except that the creators inexplicably opted for an all-black costume rather than dark red. Perhaps it was cheaper to have a black costume or maybe they felt it would be more realistic. Either way, it was a mistake. Nevertheless, the costumes not bad and it sorta makes Daredevil look like a ninja.

Daredevils origin is eventually divulged and its pretty interesting. I always felt he was one of the more fascinating superheroes due to his blindness and heightened other senses. It would take fourteen more years before Daredevil would make his theatrical debut (2003) and 26 years before hed get his own TV series (2015). Ferrigno is effective as usual as the green goliath. Unfortunately, the creators fumble the ball in the female department as the characters played by Dubois and Everhard are pretty unsubstantial.

THE FILM RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, B.C., area. WRITER: Gerald Di Pego.

7858611,4,6303957366,"I was 19 years old when this tv special first aired on NBC.  It was just a few months before the Nicholson/Keaton ""Batman"" came out, so I think it provides a good look at the way comic-book characters have been adapted for movies & tv.  It's a transitional piece.
In the '70's (and the Incredible Hulk tv show was from that time), lots of liberties were taken with comic-book adaptations for television & movies.  Colorful villains were always non-existent.  The individual personality traits of the original comic-book characters were never explored.  And worst of all, the costumes were usually cheap & innaccuarate.
After 1989's ""Batman"", that all changed.  Now film-makers & tv producers try to make their adaptations of comic-book heroes as faithful as possible to their original source.  (That's why ""Spider-Man"" is such a hit.  It's true to the comic-book!)
Well, ""The Trial of The Incredible Hulk"" is kind of in-between those two periods...and it shows!  This tv movie has singer Rex Smith doing a very good acting & fighting job as Daredevil, the blind lawyer & acrobatic superhero, making a sizeable guest appearance.  John Rhys-Davies brings Wilson Fisk (""the Kingpin"") to life as the villain.  Daredevil's background, as portrayed in this show, is pretty faithfull to the comic-book original (though in this show, he has a Gordon/Batman relationship with a cop named ""Tendelli"", which is non-existent in the comic-book.)  Even the character of ""Turk"" is portrayed in this show.  (Too bad there's no Karen Page or Foggy Nelson.)  It's obvious that the writers had been inspired by the Frank Miller Daredevils where the Hulk had made a guest appearance.  So in that sense, this show is a glimpse of things to come.
However, this show is also a glimpse of things that should have been left in the '70's, particularly the bad costuming!  Daredevil's signature red-devil acrobat uniform with a cowled-mask complete with devil horns is missing in this show.  Instead, what we have is Rex Smith dressed in a black cat-burgler's outfit!
Oh well, the story & acting are good, Rex Smith handles the martial-arts fight scenes adequately, & as always, Bill Bixby captures the tortured persona of Dr. Banner to a ""T.""
I recommend it, but in light of the new Spider-Man movie, as well as the anticipated movie releases of the Incredible Hulk & Daredevil next year, I also recommend that you don't expect too much from ""The Trial of The incredible Hulk.""",1020902400,4,2451,4.9681372549019605
