5047335,2,B0071BY31S,I WAS WAITING FOR MORE OF THE HISTORY AND THE EFFECTS OF SLUGGISH WELL PELICULAS I DO NOT LIKE ME VERY MUCH,1347667200,,107,3.909090909090909
5047336,5,B0071BY31S,"I really enjoyed this film & i'm a very picky vampire film fan being i come from the Hammer films era. I do not like cheesy vampire movies, and folks this is not one of them. Indemnity is a very well written and well paced film that holds a lot of suspense & the vampires are freaking cool, If you like films like near dark then watch this movie. I think it's suited for all aspects of the vampire genre.",1335484800,10,404,4.0625

5047341,2,B0071BY31S,"I like a wide range of vampire flicks from cheesy shlock to brooding indie.  I see a lot of other reviews credit this film because it has a plot.  That's true but the plot can only sustain about 20 minutes of movie.  The rest (it's less than an hour long) is just padding.  The acting ranges from amateurishly competent to awful.  Production values (lighting and sound) are terrible.  The ""twist"" ending was telegraphed from a continent away.  The best part of the movie is the music.  The soundtrack really enhances the ""action"" and the opening and closing credits have really good songs.  I generally don't like country music but the opening song was a winner.  Two stars, just for the music.",1422921600,3,694,4.661157024793388
5047342,4,B0071BY31S,"A man walks into a bar ... and from there unfolds a story of love, betrayal, revenge, and vampires. This is an enjoyable indie film with an original plot that held my attention all the way to the end. Full of great eccentric characters (especially the pig), it should appeal to lovers of vampire movies in the classic style. I am looking forward to seeing more work from this talented writer, actor, and director.",1377302400,2,413,4.594594594594595
5047343,1,B0071BY31S,Bad photography. Bad acting. Bad everything from what  could watch of it. Not even worth the price as a rental.,1375056000,,111,4.55
5047344,5,B0071BY31S,"Incredible! A vampire movie with a plot i haven't seen before! A crazed vampire ex girlfriend trying to kill her ex beau...it's a hilarious premise but the story is really well done, & I could definitely watch this movie multiple times. Who can't relate to having a crazy ex?",1374969600,,275,4.63265306122449
5047345,4,B0071BY31S,Very cool concept in this movie. I enjoyed it. Held my attention from start to finish. I'd recommend it to anyone. It is well-done overall.,1374710400,,139,4.6
5047346,5,B0071BY31S,"I had the privilege of see ""Indemnity"" at a film festival in Pittsburgh and was a witness to it winning an award there.  Watching it again on the home screen, I could appreciate its original story by David Dietz which is a thinking man's vampire story for those who enjoy good theatre as well as the story unfolds in a small bar primarily with memorable characters.  Dietz directed and stars as well with an incredibly well picked cast of unknowns including Dan I. Radakovich, Crystalann Jones and Megan Yost among others.  Every character is expertly portrayed by the actors making the script into a special event in its delivery of an unusual vampire story with brilliant touches of satiric comedy and well-paced suspense.  Kevin MacLeod did the original music which was especially interesting and appropriately sinister (with a selection of country and western rock music by Ruff Creek).  I have seen much talent in Pittsburgh, having lived there for 23 years and actively being a part of the film business there, but it is rare to see sure-fire talent as much as exhibited here by David Dietz.  It is all done well, right down set decoration, including a poster in the bar for the original Troma film, ""Mother's Day"" and a wanted poster for the actress who played the lead originally before being re-cast by Crystalann, of which some of her work is included in the extras with other deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage and trailer and slide gallery.  The special features on the disc by World-Wide Multi-Media include a short black-and-white film titled ""Shade's Last Run"" and also starring David Dietz with Jaime Slavinsky directed by Jason Bender also an unusual vampire tale.  One wishes there were more of both films.  Perhaps one day, we will see this film, ""Indemnity: Rage of a Jealous Vampire"" in a hallowed place in the vampire genre.  Keep it in mind.  Color.",1362700800,4,1879,4.877358490566038
8508222,5,B0071BY31S,"Again, very much worth a watch.  Cool story and an entertaining way to spend about an hour.  Funny stuff from the male lead and the bartender.  Is it the best Vampire film ever made?  No.  Is it the worst?  No.  It's a good one.  Best production value in the world?  No.  But, if you can do better; go and write something, fund it and make it.  People need to quit slamming indy films.  Takes a lot of time, hard work, and money to make anything.  I enjoyed it.",1523664000,,461,4.1022727272727275
8508223,1,B0071BY31S,"This is a short grainy film shot at night with bad sound. Most of the movie takes place in a sparsely populated bar. William (David Dietz) is running away from Angela (Crystalann Jones) who we know is a vampire from the title. We also get too many clues about William. While Angela is upset and is after William, I wouldn't use the word ""jealous"" to describe how she feels. Short and lame. I don't understand the over rating.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1441584000,2,461,4.488095238095238

8508228,1,B0071BY31S,"I love cheesy horror movies, especially vampire ones ... but even I couldn't sit through more than 10 minutes of this ridiculous movie. This isn't even good enough to watch just to make fun of it. (which I do a lot)
I recommend that you run - as far away as you possibly can from this movie!",1428364800,,291,4.12280701754386

8508230,2,B0071BY31S,Did not like,1427673600,,12,3.3333333333333335
8508231,3,B0071BY31S,Good story but lousy lighting. The acting was so bad as to be good. The lead male vampire was the only guy that seemed to be comfortable acting inn front of a camera and didn't need that two second pause to stop and read his lines off the cue cards. The film was gritty and awful. Was their budget $20.00? Other wise.....I watched the whole hour.,1426809600,,346,4.257575757575758
