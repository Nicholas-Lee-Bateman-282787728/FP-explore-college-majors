8134937,5,B000GW8S06,If you're a fan of bboying this video is for you. I suggest purchasing the other Red Bull BC One videos.,1369699200,,104,4.0
8134938,3,B000GW8S06,"For those of you who purchased the 2004 edition you might remember how fun and exciting the dvd was because it was editied and synced perfectly with some really good songs (from the b-boy canon).  The breakers fed off the music (watch Sonic sync his moves to Babe Ruth's The Mexican) as did the crowd and that energy transfers over to the audience watching at home.

Unfortunately the 2005 edition takes out all of the music that was presumably played during the actual battles and this leaves an artificial feel to the battle.  I assume that they couldn't get the rights for some of the songs and so they've replaced it with some non-descript filler music that sounds like it came off a generic ""learn to b-boy"" record.  The songs aren't that bad it's just that they're unfamiliar and as a result uninspiring.  To see the difference watch the 2005 trailer on Youtube where they use RJD2 and DJ Shadow effectively or the Star TV review where the use of music will get you as fired up as the b-boys (you've never heard Gloria Estefan used so effectively!).  At least they kept the original music for Hilty & Bosch.

The breaking on the other hand is top notch.  These guys truly are representing the best in the world and the dvd is worth it just to see the moves and the competition.  This dvd could have been so much better than what it is, hence the 3 stars.",1178150400,,1360,4.451612903225806
8134939,5,B000GW8S06,I'm a bboy and i bought this dvd to learn more about the best breakers around today and it was really tight. The battles are great and the DVD is well done like the interface and everything. The special features are nice too. It also lets you see and hear the bboys more closely. The only downside for me was the music because it's not really break beats but is still not bad at all so it deserves a 5. If your thinking about buying it do it.,1175040000,,442,4.034090909090909
8134940,4,B000GW8S06,"Positives: This DVD showcases some of the most talented B-Boys in the world today.  As a newcomer to the B-Boy scene, I'm constantly inspired by the level of skill demonstrated on this DVD.  Cinematography is really nicely done, the B-Boys are filmed from a lower angle and it gives you that feeling of awe when you watch the dancers perform on stage.  You simply have to check out the slow motion sequence in the bonus menu.  Very nice.

Negatives: I was disappointed when I found out that the DVD would not be playing the actual music that was being played during the competition.  The music they replaced the original soundtrack with is basically hit and miss.  Hit in some places, miss in others.  Some editing choices need to be questioned, such as the unnecessary cuts showing the audience reacting when we would be better served with just keeping the focus only on the B-Boys themselves. The chapter selection screen could've used some additional work, I would've liked to have had access  to the individual battles instead of having to fast forward through them because I'm only allowed to choose rounds, ie. semi-finals, quarter finals, finals, etc..

The verdict...

Despite the amount of negatives, the positives still outway them.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anybody, whether they be B-Boying or not.  The breakdancing in this DVD is high level stuff, stuff I could only dream of doing.  Highly entertaining and still enjoyable.  Like I said, it's not perfect, but it's bloody awesome.  I can't wait for the 2006 DVD to come out.  Hopefully soon.",1168819200,,1572,4.871698113207547
8134941,5,B000GW8S06,"I like this one. I felt this video was better than most new breaking videos. It was the the angle they used that made the video interesting.

The camera angle around the b boys seems to go back and forth. Also the slow motion at the end looks pretty visible and fluid and makes you wonder how did they all come up with this ? It has it's downisdes too, but the music was a thumbs up.",1165536000,,383,3.9740259740259742
8134942,5,B000GW8S06,"I have been waiting for this dvd since i saw the trailer and battle footage on youtube, and now over a year later the event is finally available. This in my opinion is the definative 1 on 1 bboy event of the year, bringing together some of the worlds top talent. Granted there are some editing problem, one of Hong10's signature moves isn't caught in his first battle with Moy (but if you go to the slow motion featurette you see it in all its illmatic glory) The single biggest flaw on this dvd is the original music is dubbed over by tracks from Dj Ace, who actually DJ'ed the event. It does suck and i hope there is an explanation as to why (i am guessing maybe they/Red Bull were not able to get the rights to the songs)but it is somewhat bearable. I also hope that this will mean the 2004 event will be on dvd soon, hopefully with its original music intact. Along with the new music there is a major flub during Storms set between the semi and final rounds. The screen goes white for a second and cuts to a front shot of Storm and a set worker using clappers to start the scene, I don't know how this got past the people who made this, its not like they had to rush, the event is over a year old. Regardless of the flaws this dvd is a must own, its that good.",1158192000,5,1264,4.100806451612903
8134943,5,B000GW8S06,This video was the reason I got back into breakdancing at the age of 26 after not doing it for the last 8 years.  I can't wait for it to come out.  I've only been able to see the highlights and the live German documentary about it while I was in Europe.  This is a must have for all break dance fans.,1156550400,,300,3.806451612903226
