4704588,5,B005HS5RWQ,"I was interest to have this opera. Based on the reviewers and cast I decided to get this selection.
I am glad because I found this performance outstanding. Andr&eacute;a Chenier played by
Pavarotti is always a guaranty that it is going to be wonderful
I was not disappointed because he was a very good singer and one of the best tenors in the world in all times. Maria Guleghina does her role very well opposite to this outstanding singer and Carlo Gerald played by Juan Pons was very well done.
I liked the music very much and I only was familiar with some areas. I also realized that the story is good, showing the cruelty of that society knowing that some elements were actual facts for instance the way Andrea Chenier was killed for his ideas, as well as that other historical situations were changed to create a romantic scene for the opera plot.
I was surprised by the quality of the film and the sound because it was done before the HD technique.
The direction by James Levine as usual was great.",1403395200,4,1003,4.4863387978142075
4704589,3,B005HS5RWQ,"I thought I ordered the Domingo version who is a much better actor.  Povaretti has a beautiful voice however his acting leaves something desired.  So, I'll enjoy the singing and us it as CD then do a better job of reading about what I am ordering in the future.",1399507200,,261,4.3061224489795915
4704590,5,B005HS5RWQ,"Pavarotti is no surprise but the performance by Juan Pons is just overwhelming, and Maria Guleghina is also in her own division.
Truth be told I haven't heard that many alternatives but I find it difficult to see and hear anything better than this. Callas and Netrebko have a strong competitor in this opera performance.",1386460800,7,320,4.836363636363636
4704591,5,B005HS5RWQ,"This Metropolitan Opera production of Andrea Chenier is a winner. The singing is superb throughout, but Pavarotti's performance in the title role is in itself worth the price of the whole DVD. Five Stars.",1373068800,4,204,5.029411764705882
4704592,5,B005HS5RWQ,This was a very good version of Andrea Chenier.  I wanted this one to add to my Pavoritti collection of DVD's.  Excellent Opera performed by Pavoritti.,1341187200,,151,4.769230769230769
4704593,4,B005HS5RWQ,"I saw this performance live at the Metropolitan Opera in 1997 and have been looking for a DVD ever since. At that time, Pavarotti was 62 years old and definitely a bit past his prime. However, by just being Pavarotti, he still makes it all totally worthwhile. Besides, he is more than ably supported by both Maria Guleghina and Juan Pons, not to mention the superb accompaniment by a still young James Levine at his best.
""Andrea Chenier"" happens to be one of my favorite operas and I have both the Jose Carreras and the Jose Cura DVDs each of which has its own merits. But, at least to this reviewer, taken as a whole presentation, this particular ""Andrea Chenier"" with an Italian title hero - and the Italian being Luciano Pavarotti - outshines them all.

4704594,5,B005HS5RWQ,"Until seeing the final duet performed by Bocelli & Martinez(?) on PBS recently, I was not familiar with this opera (other than having heard of it).  The first question that came to my mind was ""Why is this not performed more often?"".  The second one was ""Which DVD should I get?"".  I quickly settled on this new release from a 1996 performance and must say that I have just about worn it out!  Everything about it is top notch.  Of course, the main attraction was Pavarotti; but I have also now discovered Juan Pons and Maria Guleghina, neither of whom I had ever heard of (and WOW!).  Do yourself a huge favor and add this to your collection ASAP!",1328054400,17,648,4.4033613445378155
4704595,5,B005HS5RWQ,The best recording yet of Andrea Chenier. The audio and picture quality are excellent. Too bad it is not on Blu-ray.,1321660800,6,116,4.571428571428571
8473584,2,B005HS5RWQ,"Before I get to my notes, a reminder that two stars is ""I don't like it"" on Amazon. It's not that bad of a production.

Good aspects:
- Expert conducting by James Levine, with particular excellence coming from the brass. This was one of the Maestro's best genres (late 19th/early 20th Italian opera), and his work is nothing short of perfect.
- As others have said, really decent pairing of Pavarotti, Guleghina, and Pons. Pons starts off a little slow in act I, but starts to cook once he gets to act III.
- Production winks at the French Revolution without literally rendering it. Probably the best way to do it.

Not as good aspects:
- Characters are not very dynamic in their performances. I'm not certain if this was a revival or continuation of Jol's production, but everyone's acting is either overly broad (Pons, Guleghina), or seemingly lost (Pavarotti, Blythe, Fu). This is not an actor's/director's production.
- The chorus - mainly the women - doesn't make a great first impression and continues to falter down the stretch. The women's chorus in Act I is one of my favorites in opera, and I was left very disappointed.
- This was before the era when the Met started to figure out how to shoot their shows on film, so I would anticipate being frustrated by a few too many close-ups and fuzzy picture quality every now and then.",1518998400,,1338,4.617647058823529

8473589,5,B005HS5RWQ,"This is a traditional performance, as well as a magnificent one. Pavarotti and Guleghina are at the top of their voices. The quality of the acting is excellent. Pavarottis acting, something for which he is, most certainly, not known, even scores high grades.
 Every one of the arias rings, with depth and beauty. Every voice is excellent, even in the minor roles.
 You will not go wrong, with this purchase.",1461542400,,407,4.8
8473590,4,B005HS5RWQ,"I have been watching the videotape I made from this 1997 Met production broadcast on PBS for 18 years now.  I finally decided to purchase the DVD.  I also own the Carreras/Marton version, which is also good, but for some inexplicable reason, I prefer this one.  Pavarotti does look older, and he moves around with some difficulty, but he still sounds fantastic!  What can I say?  Nobody sings better than he did.  Juan Pons does a very believable job as Gerard, and Maria Guleghina both looks and sounds beautiful in this production in her pretty blond wig.  She is also an excellent actress.  Addendum 8/28/15.  I have finally gotten around to watching this DVD, and I am blown away by the sharpness of the picture.  I have watched over 1,000 films on Netflix, and this DVD is sharper than any of them.",1432512000,,803,4.591549295774648

8473592,4,B005HS5RWQ,"The cast here says it all. By now this DVD recording of a Metropolitan Opera production, with the great orchestra under the direction of Levine, and a cast headed by Pavorotti, may seem to some to be a dated vehicle, largely useful as a historical documentation. But no. There is much more here: the singer, and the music. Andrea Chenier may not be the most engaging story in opera - what is? - however, it is produced, played, and fills the house for exactly such evenings as are captured here.",1424908800,,495,4.511111111111111
8473593,5,B005HS5RWQ,"This live from the Met telecast from October 1996 of Giordanos infrequently performed verismo gem is an absolute pleasure to watch and listen to and I highly recommend it.  Nicholas Joels production is extremely elegant while at the same time being simple and uncluttered.  Act I, for example, is dominated by an enormous gilt-framed mirror precariously tilted.  I assume that it is a metaphor for the imminent downfall of the decadent aristocracy at the party given by the Contessa di Coigny.  The costumes designs by Hubert Monloup are terrific.  The prerevolutionary costumes in Act I are simply stunning each one individually tailored for the choristers and major performers.

The DVD is of excellent quality.  The stage lighting is beautifully done and the audio is superb.  James Levine is in top form as the conductor.
There is not a mediocre performance in the entire production.  Juan Pons as Carlo Gerard produces a highly nuanced acting performance.  He convincingly portrays a character filled in Act I with hatred for the excesses of the French aristocracy, but later full of regret for the excesses of the Revolution which he himself helped to bring about.  His singing is quite beautiful.  His rendition of Son sessant anni in Act I is full of passion and power.  However, it was his Nemico della patria in Act III that appropriately brought the house down.

Maria Guleghina as Maddalena is convincingly youthful for the role and looks elegant and beautiful in Monloups exquisite costumes.  Her singing too is quite exquisite and her La mamma morta in Act III was rapturously received by the audience.  Luciano Pavarottis golden lirico-spinto sound makes him ideal for the role of the doomed poet.  All his arias including the Improviso in Act I, his Credo a una possanza arcana in Act II, his Si, fui soldato when before the Revolutionary tribunal and his lovely Come un bel di di Maggio in Act IV are beautifully sung without apparent effort and his voice sounds full and fresh.

The only minor quibble is that while Pavarottis acting ability was somewhat better here than usual, the numerous close-ups of him were not at all flattering showing him heavily made up, often covered in facial sweat and wearing an ill-fitting wig.  The chemistry between him and Guleghina was, however, very good and the passionate love duet with Guleghina in Act II and the Vicino a te duet that closes the opera had sublime moments.

A particularly impressive feature of this production is that the lesser roles down to and including the comprimarios are filled by singers who do a better job than singers of major roles in most other opera houses.  Judith Christin is delightful as the Contessa di Coigny, Stephanie Blythe gives a wonderful and moving performance as the blind Madelon and Wendy White is a delightful Bersi who manages to convert Act II at the Caf Hottot in Paris to an equivalent of the vibrant Caf Momus in La Boheme with her singing and acting reminding me of the best Musettas.  Richard Vernon is excellent as Schmidt the jailer.  Paul Plishka as Mathieu is a convincingly brutal and well-sung sans culotte and Michel Senechal as the spy lIncredibile is simply wonderful.

This Volpe-era production of Andrea Chenier reminds us what opera is and should be about.  Its an old-fashioned production with lovely somewhat modern sets.  I hope the production is never abandoned and replaced by an Andrea Chenier set at some different time or in a place other than Paris as seems to be happening more frequently nowadays at the Met in their peculiar quest to make operas more hip so that theyll attract a younger audience.  We can only hope that if the Met can ever again assemble a cast of this quality for a new Chenier that we won't have to face a production set in Las Vegas or in some time period other than that of the French Revolution!",1411257600,5,3856,4.829528158295282
