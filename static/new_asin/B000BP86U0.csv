8090426,4,B000BP86U0,"An hors d'oeuvre about the length of the typical hour TV show when one excludes the commercials (the actual operetta I clocked at 40  minutes if one omits the credits). If one accepts the time limitation, it should be an enjoyable prelude to something heavier, a nice short opera, perhaps, or dance program of limited duration. In its day, its comedy must have arisen from the naivet of the bride and bridegroom as to exactly how to consummate the marriage on the Wedding Night. How today's younger generations raised with school sex education and early sexual practice will react to the convent raised bride and the sexually innocent husband, I cannot guess. Older folk should still see the humor rather than abhor the ignorance, so I can commend to them and  suggest that the others may also enjoy it, if they can simply settle back and enjoy a comedy from a day when Virginity of the Female was still a common expectation.",1447113600,,925,4.703703703703703
8090427,4,B000BP86U0,"This DVD is great entertainment for a weeknight.  It is 47 minutes of hilarious bedroom farce.  The story line and the dialogues are very funny.  There are no arias, but Chabrier's music for the dialogues is beautiful.  All 3 roles are well-sung.  Mary St. Palais is outstanding as the clueless bride.",1316649600,,301,4.823529411764706
8090428,4,B000BP86U0,"This very droll as well as somewhat racy light opera (properly translated in this instance as A FAULTY EDUCATION), composed by one of France's 19th century premier masters of melody, Emmanuel Chabrier, had originally been produced, and first performed by him at the piano, in 1879, with its two principal roles sung by sopranos, Chabrier's preference for these parts, although one of them was subsequently switched to a tenor, with the instrumental score being mildly supplemented during the 20th century by Darius Milhaud, while keeping intact the work's felicities within its vocal pages.  The setting for the operetta (and for this film) is 18th century Paris, with its action occurring within a chateau belonging to Count Boismassif, where a freshly married couple, the Count's son, Gontran (Franck Cassard, tenor) and his bride Hlne de la Cerasaie (Mary Saint Palais, mezzo-soprano) open the film during a squally night that is impressively realised through dramatic lighting effects.  A contemporary convention dictates that an elderly member from each of the bride and the groom's families must respectively advise the young pair as to correct first night romantic comportment.  However, Gontran's grandfather sends a written message that states in his day no outside guidance was required, while a letter from Hlne's maiden aunt includes insipid suggestions to her that are completely insufficient.  Because the newly wedded couple is apparently hopelessly unseasoned, they are forced to rely upon a friar, Pausanias (Philippe Fourcade, baritone), for amatory direction, but his besotted state is guaranteed to cause his guidance to be only patchily useful.  The lovers are therefore snared in a situation wherein they will be forced to develop their own bed chamber gambits.  The film is shot in 1.33:1 speed before a live audience in 1994 at the Thtre Imprial de Compigne, a performance plotted to observe the 100th anniversary of Chabrier's passing, as a segment of the 1993/94 Saison Lyriques et Musicales de Compigne.  It is produced as well as directed by Pierre Jourdan, a renowned specialist in the quarrying of classical French musical in addition to lyrical theatre, particularly those works composed during the 19th century.  Michel Swierczewski capably conducts a pick-up orchestra labelled Sinfonietta de Picardie in support of the three soloists, providing a splendid instrumental framework that is nicely captured, as are the visuals (clear even during dark scenes), crisply upon a Kultur full-screen 4:3 DVD.  The  operetta's sets, designed and arranged by Jourdan and Gilles Dubernet, are strikingly simple for this compound of melodrama and sentimentality.  The mentioned opening episode lighting effects, created by Thierry Alexandre, are most engaging.  Saint Palais is in excellent voice and her acting dominates the performance.  There are no extra features included with the DVD for this short (47 minute) film.  It is sung in French and there are largely accurate English subtitles.",1299024000,,3014,5.426124197002141
8090429,3,B000BP86U0,"Chabrier's music is effervescent, constantly entertaining, the DVD unfortunately mediocre, the sound fuzzy, the color almost non-existent and instead of two sopranos singing husband and wife the producers have substituted a tenor.  It would have been much wittier if left the way Chabrier intended it.  Incidentally, Chabrier never heard the work performed with his orchestration during his lifetime--he only played it with piano for a few delighted men (he was a good friend of Manet's).  The two soprano version is available on CD.  If you need some minimal visuals this DVD will have to do.",1292716800,,593,5.2105263157894735
8090430,4,B000BP86U0,"Another nicely done Pierre Jourdan production.  Nicely filmed, beautifully sung, the sets were simple but effective.  One cannot turn off the english subtitles.  Similarly there is no choice of sound playback.  However the images are clear, the sound lovely.  The opera was recorded in 1994 according to material in the DVD's credits.",1236470400,,334,5.346153846153846
8090431,4,B000BP86U0,"""Une Education Manquee"" is one act comedy by Emmanuel Chabrier very witty, well performed, about a young just married couple who have a problem with their wedding night untill a horrendous thunder throws them into each other's arms. The melodious score enhences the charm of the work. I recommend it for anyone who chooses to add it to their operatic knowledge.

8090432,3,B000BP86U0,"First the bad.  You are paying for a 47 minute operetta.  It sounds and looks like a movie production from the 1940s, even though it appears to have been made in the 80s or 90s.  The good is that I laughed throughout, the performers are good and the music is excellent Chabrier who I rank higher than Offenbach and Arthur Sullivan.  I wish we would also get GWENDOLINE and LE ROI MALGR? LUI on DVD.

Remember the old stories about what happens on a wedding night when neither the bride nor groom has been instructed about the birds and the bees?  This is a cutesy French version.  The best number, for me, was the patter duet between Abb? Pausanias and his pupil Gontran which rivals anything that Gilbert and Sullivan cooked up,

P: You translated at sight

Lucan, Virgil, Ovid, Horace.

Juvenal who isn't very clear.

Valerius, Flaccus and Stafus.

G: There's no denying it, Pausanias,

But... It's not enough!

Apparently the version given here is a revision by Darius Milhaud.  Gontran was originally a pants role.",1146960000,,1018,4.672316384180791
