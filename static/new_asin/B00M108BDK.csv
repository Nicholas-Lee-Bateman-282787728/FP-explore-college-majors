8669524,4,B00M108BDK,"Weiss' books, workbooks, & dvds (and thus, obviously, the author himself) are extremely FRAGMENTED. There is so much powerful therapeutic healing info in his ""Helping Her Heal"" dvd, ""Worthy"" dvd & its workbook (minus his Imprisonment-for-Wife Sex Agreement (refer to authors Cliff & Joyce Penner books who promote loving, safe, & satisfying marital sexual intimacy for both wife and husband), his Married & Alone and Partner dvd & 12 Step workbooks, and approximately 85% of his M&Alone and Partners Exercises workbooks (the remaining 15% or so in each contains exercises which are falsely accusatory, toxic, and very shaming of the wife, and thus highly detrimental for her healing). But then this same author who provides a vast amount of high-quality healing info for wives, then does a complete 180 degree turn in strongly promoting his beliefs & attitudes toward wives which can only be described as none other than that of absolutely and thoroughly gender violence (and no, this is not at all an exaggeration). For example: he very strongly pushes - and also severely shames the wife of being a bad person/wife if she challenges his warped beliefs about this in any of the following regards... that a wife is to be sexual EVEN though the sex addict is new to recovery and thus not yet stable and this then threatens her physical safety (and also her overall emotional & psychological safety and well-being) by him possibly infecting her with a STD which he may contract from his acting out behavior (which happens very frequently with sex addicts), which has serious health implications for her - even death (yes, some wives of sex addicts have died from this very process). And then, despite writing that it won't be until the husband has been in solid recovery for 6-9 months until he will stop being mean/cruel/unkind/non-empathetic (very frequent part of sex addicts' treatment of their wives) to her, she is STILL to be sexual with him! This is outright sexual, emotional & psychological abuse of women. He wrote and spoke that even though a husband has wrongfully angered her and thus mistreated her or if something comes up in 'life', she cannot refuse to be sexual with him and if she does she must inflict herself with a very unpleasant self-punishment (the idea that he thinks punishment, in and of itself, should ever have a part in marital sex life, is indeed truly frightening). In this way, he is teaching husbands that they are not accountable for how they treat their wives, but still are entitled/licensed to get 'his sex.' And not only all of this, but then during sex - no matter how he has treated her in the days and weeks prior - she is suppose to completely deny her feelings and to lie to him telling him what an amazing man and husband he is, AND to engage with him sexually AS IF he has been good and loving toward her as a person, and thus feeding his narcissistic delusions that he is an amazing husband and deserving of amazing sexual experiences with his wife no matter how awful he is toward her. Weiss does not promote what Patrick Carnes and a great majority of sex addiction recovery therapists do: sex addicts need an initial 90-day complete sexual abstinence followed by multiple shorter periods of abstinence throughout the first three years of their recovery. This helps return the addicts desire for sex neurochemicals from the illicitly super-highly elevated level down to normal God-designed levels; and it also helps the man to learn to live his life without turning to sex to medicate his emotions, as well as to have this time and space to begin maturing emotionally, spiritually, psychologically, socially and no longer turn to sex to fill all of these needs/voids. The mans sexuality returns to being one of living in serenity where HE controls his sexuality rather than vice-versa, and he no longer looks to use as his vaginal masturbator (as author Jason Martinkus wrote in his great book Worthy of Her Trust) and to drain his wife by demanding sex for all these wrong, unhealthy reasons, and no longer that of essentially throwing up their out-of-control sexuality upon their wife. They learn mutual, loving, nurturing, satisfying sexual INTIMACY. Additionally, Weiss declares the cheater-betrayer husband is to be given the RIGHT to 50% 'say' in the frequency of their sex life. He teaches the wife to listen to her intuition EXCEPT she can't when it comes to when, how frequent, and despite him being mean/cruel/unkind to her, in regards to the cheater-betrayer husband wanting and getting 'his sex' (because it sure isn't that of sexual intimacy). Incredulously, Weiss also adamantly pushes the very unhealthy, sick, manipulative, ridiculous, Caretaking Codependent practice of telling the wife that SHE, not her husband, is responsible for her husbands particular male sex organ. Every therapist worth half their salt knows that EACH person is solely responsible for fully their OWN body and personhood, and ONLY theirs. This is all completely and thoroughly outrageous, and it seemingly appears that Weiss has not himself thoroughly cleaned out/recovered from all of his sex addict beliefs and attitudes regarding marital sex, which are absolutely NOT marital sexual INTIMACY whatsoever, because how ELSE could he strongly promote over the past 30 years or so, that of such sexual-emotional-psychological-physical-spiritual exploitation and abuse of women/wives?! According to his extremely demanding-dismissive-disregard, harmful-to-wives beliefs and attitude, it sounds very much like that of a yet-not-fully-recovered sex addict thinking-belief-attitudes (see Patrick Carnes books/workbook explaining how sex addiction is far more than behavior but it also includes beliefs and attitudes) of a husband/man still being addicted to/very dependent on, the sex neurochemicals to be able to function in his daily life, and in being demanding and desperate to get his drug fix (as author Milton Magness wrote: sex addiction is not primarily about sex, but rather that of a drug addiction, that of generating one's own sex neurochemicals) no matter how destructive, damaging, or potentially devastating it is to wives/women, and strongly promoting that all husbands can fully expect that these are their rights, too. And, whether OR NOT a man being a sex addict of ANY level, the above applies to ALL husbands in becoming responsible, mature ADULTS in sexually and overall relating to their wives. Weiss (& everyone) very much need to read The Sexual Healing Journey by Wendy Maltz to learn and then consistently apply the list of 17 characteristics of healthy sex and 17 of UNhealthy sex. Again, please refer to Joyce & Cliff Penner, John & Julie Gottman, Jason Martinkus, or Milton Magness books when it comes to learning about safe, loving, satisfying, mature, and nurturing marital sexual intimacy, as well as overall marital intimacy. Also, refer to the excellent books ""Wired for Intimacy"" by William Struthers and ""The Fight of Your Life"" by Tim Clinton & Mark Laaser to gain an excellent understanding about marital sexual and overall intimacy, and the brain damage which sex addiction causes and how it plays out toward other innocent people, including their wives.",1521244800,,7230,5.107263513513513
