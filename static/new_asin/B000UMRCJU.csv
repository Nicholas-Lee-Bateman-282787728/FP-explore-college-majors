8213837,3,B000UMRCJU,"The information on the DVD is excellent.  She covers way more than simple scrapbooking but also handmade albums, etc.  The Theme of the DVD was way too ""cutesy"".  The music was very annoying.  After awhile the music made me want to scratch my own eyes out.  Sandy is a little rude to her guests many times and tends to interrupt their explanations.",1251936000,,348,4.548387096774194
8213838,4,B000UMRCJU,I was very pleased with the number of episodes I received for the price.  I have been taping these shows on my DVR for a few years now so was very happy to find a DVD that I could keep and watch over and over if need be.,1233360000,,220,3.5833333333333335
8213839,5,B000UMRCJU,"I just received this DVD set as a Christmas gift. I was really surprised and excited because as much as I enjoy the show, I never am able to catch it on TV. The product listed here is a 3-disc set with various episdoes of the DIY Network Scrapbooking Show. Each episode runs about 20 minutes, usually covering 4 projects similar in subject. The best thing about it is, sometimes they go a little fast because of time constraints, so with a DVD, you can pause, FF/rewind, and replay all you want. For anyone who enjoys scrapbooking and getting new ideas for doing so, this is a must!",1198713600,4,582,4.398148148148148
8213840,3,B000UMRCJU,This 3 disc DVD set is a group of episodes of the DIY Scrapbooking show hosted by Sandi Genovese and I found them very helpful and interesting.  Each episode focuses on a particular method of enhancing your scrapbook pages or card-making.  They provide step-by-step instructions.  I am ordering a second set as a gift.,1195776000,2,318,4.851851851851852
