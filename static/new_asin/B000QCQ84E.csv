To me this is too dangerous of a weapon to train with without proper explanation on the techniques.",1388707200,,257,4.26530612244898

8195487,3,B000QCQ84E,The person in the video is skilled and an excellent artist. In fact he is so advanced that a beginner may have trouble following his movements. He does not do a lot of teaching--he performs demonstrations.,1293667200,5,205,4.722222222222222
