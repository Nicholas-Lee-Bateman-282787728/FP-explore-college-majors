8029900,5,B0002OMSVI,I am surprised that this movie has not been shown on one of the movie channels. It might be due to the racial issues involved. Who knows.  It is a cliff hanger with a partially happy ending.  I don't want to say any more because if I do I will give away the ending.  George Kennedy has always done a fine job and this film is no exception. William Windom also demonstrates his versatility.  He is quite the jerk in this one.  The film is old but the story is still relevant.  Don't hitch hike! I highly recommend this movie.,1465171200,,524,4.19
