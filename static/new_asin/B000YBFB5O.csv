You hold up a flash card, say the sound of the letter that is shaped like an animal, and the child says a the sound and does a hand signal along witht he sound. LIke bubba bear says ""b"" and you act like you are reaching up for honey, because bears like to eat honey. Allie alligator says the short ""A"" sound. You hold up the lower case letter A  and say ""a"" and the child makes a snapping motion with their arms like an alligators jaws. Great great program.",1284163200,,582,4.0964912280701755
8231742,5,B000YBFB5O,"We moved when my child was 4. She had been in what was considered a very good preschool program in our old city. We enrolled her at a preschool that used zoo phonics when we moved. I was so surprised after about 6 weeks she was sounding out words in books and she was having so much fun. Compared to the traditional methods at her first school zoo phonics was far better.
It was great to see my child have so much fun learning to read. I'm disappointed more materials are not available for parents.",1204156800,3,498,4.252631578947368
