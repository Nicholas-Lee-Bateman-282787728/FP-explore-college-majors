It begins on a paddle-wheel steamer that arrives in New Orleans. People greet the passengers. There is a conflict over past legal matters. The Lottery is run by the Mirbeau family. One woman wants to slose this gambling operation. [Are many harmed to benefit a few?] Its Mardi Gras time (Fat Tuesday - before Lent begins). Masks are worn as part of this celebration. Is New Orleans the nearest equivalent to Paris? There is a drawing for the winning lottery tickets. There is a winner! Watch what happens to one winner; he is taken to the Parisian Palace and swindled out of his winnings. An investigator for the Anti-Lottery League goes there. But Gaston won't talk now. Mr. Reynolds visits General Mirbeau and asks about the murder.

Reynolds says the Lottery business is behind Organized Crime in the city. Mirbeau says the Lottery supports the City Hospital and other charities. The Anti-Lottery League seeks more signatures on its petitions. The group that controls the Mayors office has a diplomatic scheme. Mirbeau reproaches Blackburn for taking kick-backs; he will be replaced. We see a butting match at the Parisian Palace. Will one man join the Reform League as a spy? A gang attacks General Mirbeau, their signs identify them as Reynolds supporters. Mr. Williams takes control. Reynolds talks to Julie and is rejected. Julie visits the business office of the Lottery to plan strategy. Lottery salesmen force tickets on unwilling buyers. Can they be prosecuted? Not if the witnesses are afraid to testify!

Can New Orleans be cleaned up? Mrs. Gaston will testify. Reynolds asks the other witnesses to reconsider - and they do. The gang follows Reynolds. There is a fight. There is a court hearing to revoke the business license of the Lottery. Julie Mirbeau argues for the defendant. She offers money to pay for the damages, the Judge agrees! [Watch this closely.] Mr. Tibbett talks to Williams (a spy for the gang). The Judge is in cahoots with the Lottery Combine; so too the Mayor. What can the Reformers do? Williams wants to marry Julie. Can Reynolds get the Lotterys business records? Yes (its not ethical but its funny). The records reveal the pay-offs. The police arrive at the Parisian Palace to raid this place. One Madame spills the beans!

Julie realizes she has been fooled. I know what you're thinking says Blackburn. The police arrest the Lottery Combine and City Heads. There is a court trial. But the records of the pay-offs has disappeared! [The spy stole them.] But Miss Julie testifies until the storm interrupts the court proceedings. Rising waters floods New Orleans. Men pile sand bags on the levees, but there is a breach and huge waves destroy buildings. Can Williams commandeer a ship? Will the people be saved? Only if Reynolds can take command of the ship. He does! The breach in the levee is plugged, the people are saved. There will be a happy ending for Julie and Reynolds.

This is a very entertaining and educational movie. The problem of crooked politicians acting for organized crime or the aristocracy is a problem (then or now). This story must be loosely based on actual events. The problem of gambling goes on today. It promises benefits but only delivers problems. You can look at Atlantic City NJ or other casino resorts. Gambling does not produce wealth, it only acts as a parasite on the fools who think they will get something for nothing. The only winners are those who run the gambling operations. And even that is not guaranteed.",1427155200,,3542,4.857615894039735
