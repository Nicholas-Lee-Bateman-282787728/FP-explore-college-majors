7893006,4,6305698945,"Not as dated as a 1968 film might appear.  This is a reasonably compelling drama which keeps the viewer interested to the end, despite its leisurely direction.  The gorgeous Jane Birkin gets ""May Morning"" bonus points.  If you like 60s-vintage British cinema, you could do worse.",1480291200,,279,5.021739130434782
7893007,2,6305698945,"""May Morning"" centers on the conflict surrounding an italian student, Valerio,(Alessio Orano) who cannot fit into undergraduate life at Oxford University by refusing to conform with college tradition and code of behavior. With his unconventional attitude, Valerio is destined to produce unexpected and sometimes tragic results.
This is surely a cult movie for those who like the 70's, especially because of the good soundtrack, composed by The Tremeloes. The casting is fine, but I belive the plot could be better than it is. When I first saw the DVD case, I did not know what to expect, mainly because I never read a critic about this movie. I can assure you this film is not recommended for those who dislike violent films.
In my opinion, the DVD version lacks some technical details. The british accent is very strong and the movie is dubbed most part of the time, which makes it hard to fully understand what the cast is saying.",973209600,8,932,4.83125
