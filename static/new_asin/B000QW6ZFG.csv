8197856,3,B000QW6ZFG,"A slightly different take on the Robin Hood theme.  This movie teeters back and forth between 2 and 3 stars for me.  There were some good parts, some funny parts and the pace was good for the most part.  But I wish a couple of the sub-plots had been given a little more attention.

I can forgive the mostly poor acting and the poor sound, but the Irish folk songs served no purpose.

Overall, it a nice look at what can be done in a low-budget film independent film.  It has some substance to it, some heart and some brains.  Just not enough to make it more then an OK film.",1182816000,,574,4.117117117117117
8197857,5,B000QW6ZFG,"""The Minx"" is a hilarious no-budget independent film about a sexy, female, Asian-American Robin Hood figure (Mia Park) set in modern-day Chicago. It begins with a montage of her exploits (stealing from the rich, giving to the homeless), an extraordinary sequence that harkens back to early silent-era cinema. From there, the story unfolds as The Minx becomes romantically involved with a Hispanic reporter (Edgar Alvarez) while simultaneously fighting off the advances of a sleazy CEO (Circus-Szalewski). Suspense is generated as both of these men, as well as the chief of the Chicago Police Department (Duane Sharp), begin to figure out her real identity.

Shot on video and made for the DVD market, this is easily the best film of its kind I've ever seen. Although it was obviously made for no money, it's an enormously entertaining film - fast-paced, funny and full of killer dialogue and colorful performances. In particular, the way Circus-Szalewski reads his lines has to be heard to be believed. Lead actress Mia Park comes across as cold and reserved in her early scenes but has a highly emotional climactic scene that causes you to re-evaluate her entire character.

Fans of silent movies, Hong Kong action, French new wave-style self-reflexivity and good old American indie films should take note. In an age of cookie-cutter Hollywood blockbusters with big budgets but no soul, ""The Minx"" is truly a breath of fresh air.",1179964800,2,1430,5.1068376068376065
