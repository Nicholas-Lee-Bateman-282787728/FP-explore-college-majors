435920,3,6302213304,"No where near any of the earlier Republic Seriels, but a good watch, The Lone Ranger in a different type of role, and Lois Lane as a Blond",1463443200,,138,3.9642857142857144
435921,5,6302213304,Reminds me of the serial shows I watched as a child. You would watch an episode and eagerly await the next episode.,1461801600,,115,4.2727272727272725

435965,5,6302213304,"as a long time fan of western, jungle, Tarzan and Lone Ranger movies, thanks to my dad, i learned to appreciate good fun action acting...and the name Clayton Moore is forever etched, among many others, in my mind...so anytime i get to find a movie with the names i respect, i gotta see it...this time, Clayton Moore in a jungle themed feature, as a Jungle Jim type character (reminding me of another well respected athlete turned actor, Johnny Weissmuller) brings me joy of watching him (together with my dad equals double joy ) in a role full of action and adventure.",1454544000,,568,4.633663366336633
435966,5,6302213304,"Great campy movie from the 50's, especially the Lone Ranger without his mask.  It also shows how black actors like Roy Glenn had to find work in this movie in the 50's as the Witch Doctor and then came on to be Sidney Poitier's father in Guess who's coming to Dinner.",1454198400,,267,4.235294117647059
435967,4,6302213304,"This movie should take you back to your childhood.  Clayton Moore, who played the Lone Ranger, makes the this serial.",1453507200,,117,4.85
435968,5,6302213304,"Wonderfully campy, fun serial and with the Lone Ranger sans mask no less! Literally thousands of rounds of ammo fired (endless arrows as well) and I think maybe 3 people were hit; even multiple attacks with dynamite don't phase our heroes! Every cliched African movie trick is in this; crocodiles, hippos, lion and men in a pit, quicksand (in the middle of a river), the evil witch doctor, a tiger in Africa, trees bent to snare the unwary, girl over pit of fire, cute chimps and an excellent African Tribal Chief who speaks English better than most English professors to name a few. Just flat out fun to watch--simple, innocent and a trip back in time. If you want realism, logical behavior and blood go elsewhere.  Otherwise enjoy!",1453334400,,733,4.7265625
435969,1,6302213304,"Where do I begin to try and describe what so far has taken me three days to try and get through this absolutely horrible serial. Clayton Moore AKA ""The Lone ""Ranger"" was better off playing The Lone Ranger. Interesting to see a blond Phyllis Cortes, the first Lois Lane from Superman series but that interest does not last very long. Each endless episode contains a fight between the good guys and the bad guys. The good guys fired hundreds of rounds from revolvers that never need to be reloaded and could not hit a target if it was six feet in front of them while the bad guys, natives fire hundreds of arrows without ever hitting anyone. Each episodes of course concludes with a cliff hanger which results in an unspectacular solution at the beginning of the next episode. The native chief speaks perfect English as does his evil witch doctor which for some reason no one can figure out is the cause of most of the problems. Actually I'm not even sure what the plot of this god awful movie is or why everyone is trying to kill each others which would have been a blessing. The best line from this movie is ""there are no tigers in Africa"" Really? Since when are there no tigers in Africa
causing one tiger to be imported to scare the natives? What finally and mercifully got me to stop watching this thing was when a scene from episode three I believe was repeated in it's entirety in around the tenth episode. The idea of these serials was to get movie audiences to return the following week to see how the cliff hanger was resolved.  Trust me after about four episodes of this thing you're not going to care one way or the other what has happened to anyone in this serial.",1448755200,,1675,4.4207119741100325

Entertaining",1448236800,,29,6.5
435971,3,6302213304,"Clayton Moore, Phyllis Coates and miles of stock footage in this late period serial.  Chapters sometimes stop while lead characters simply watch stock shots of animals in the African Veldt.  You expect one of the actors to say... ""Oh, look... a stock shot.""  Shot primarily on the Republic lot, using either fake, studio-bound interior sets with back projection, the cave and green stage and the much-used ""jungle"" on the back lot (Seen also in Panther Girl of the Kongo).  Still, they had the budget for a couple of days at Iverson Ranch and another day or two in what looks like Thousand Oaks (simulating the 'veldt."").  And the pacing is good and fast.  And a weak Republic serial is still better than the rest...",1447027200,,716,4.733870967741935
435972,2,6302213304,"I tried this to watch while eating supper. It turns out this is a Saturday matinee series glued together into a ""movie"". For some reason, I didn't watch it to the end so if anyone wants to watch it and tell me how it ends, Great. The most interesting thing about this movie is the lead actor, billed as Clay Moore in this movie. He is actually Clayton Moore, the actor who played The Lone Ranger on the television series for many years, unfortunately sans Tonto. So, if you want to see what the ""masked man"" looked like without the mask way back then, take a gander at this movie.",1446940800,,580,4.281818181818182
435973,1,6302213304,It took me a while to realize why the stars voice was so familiar - it was The Lone Ranger from the 50/60s TV show.  However the story was still a bust.  stopped watching half an hour.  Sorry Clayton.  Stick to the westerns.,1446249600,,224,4.1395348837209305

436003,5,6302213304,"Jungle Drums of Africa:  Another slam-bang action serial from Republic, with a fun setting and the added attraction of having Clayton Moore and Phyllis Coates in the lead roles.  Highly entertaining and highly recommended.  This Cheezy Flicks release has sharp, clean picture and sound.

FYI, I bought this from Cheezy Distribution via Amazon along with several other titles because they offered the best price, and they refunded me more than 90% of the system-generated per-title shipping costs, only charging me what it actually cost to ship the DVDs.  For the volume of titles I bought, purchasing them at a lower price from Cheezy and paying only five bucks to ship the lot was a far better deal than buying the DVDs at a higher list price from Amazon to get the free-shipping-over-$35 deal.",1433894400,,795,4.947368421052632

436009,4,6302213304,Always like any work of Clayton Moore. Also liked Phyllis Coates. A little hoky and predictible but it was entertaining. Cliffhangers were fair to good. They must have fired over 100 rounds of bullets in the first 10 chapters and hit nobody! Not realistic. The strong point is the nostalgia value of Moore and Coates!,1391904000,,317,4.781818181818182

Roy Glenn is the Kenyan ""Medicine Man"". Bill Walker (actor and Civil Rights leader) is also excellent, as ""Chief Douanga"".

I'm up to episode Four: so far, only one scream from Phyllis.

By Chapter Ten: Coates in shorts and high boots, suddenly very sexed up, with wavy platinum blonde hair. Screaming away.

It's not that the acting was bad in this movie, it was that the story line, and end of the segment cliff hangers were so disappointing.  What you see at the end of one episode is never the same as how it starts up in the following episode.  But that's how you got your audience to return next week and see what happened.

They have Clayton Moore's name listed as Clay Moore as well, he must have insisted they list it as Clayton when he started up the Lone Ranger.  Also, I have never seen a movie where hundreds if not thousands of bullets were fired and no one ever gets hit.  If you like that kind of stuff, be my guest, it just wasn't for me!
