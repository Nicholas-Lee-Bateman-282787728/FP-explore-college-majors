8538179,3,B0099VUVZA,"OK mid 40's burlesque house murder-mystery.  Pretty much a remake of the far better Lady of Burlesque.  Burlesque queens are dropping like flies, being murdered by any one of several working at the grind house.  The musical and dance numbers are typical 40's mild.  The lead suspect is the main headliner.  The acting is adequate.  Evelyn Ankers plays the lead burlesquer.  She seems too refined an actress to be believable as a Gypsy Rose Lee character.  Still, a nice time-passer.  The quality of the Mr. Fat-W Video DVD-R is pretty good.  The picture quality is pretty clear.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1527379200,,615,4.87378640776699
8538180,3,B0099VUVZA,"Easy top take B-movie. Moves quickly. Stays interesting. Performances are unbeven, but miost are professional. Guessing the killer is not that easy.",1461888000,,148,5.7727272727272725
8538181,3,B0099VUVZA,"If you're hoping or expecting to see a very sexy movie here, you'll be a bit disappointed, but this movie does have some beautiful scantily clad women. The plot is a fairly run of the mill suspenseful murder mystery, and it does seem to drag on a little too long, but it's worth a look.
There's not enough burlesque entertainment in it to flesh it out a little. Most of it is concerned with finding out who the killer is.",1454112000,,421,4.275
8538182,3,B0099VUVZA,"Overtones--okay--- directly from the Barbara Stanwyck, Michael O'Shea- ""Lady of Burlesque"" 1943 movie. Just a few changes in the plot of ""who really dun-'it"" and the songs are not the Academy Award nomination of Arthur Lange's musical score from ""Lady"" either. Both movies are based on the Gypsy Rose Lee book, ""The G-String Murders"" and  No, I am not going to tell you who ""dun-it""--or where the ""script changes"" are located---but, it is the same--someone back stage hates the dancers--and the dancer's names are similar to ""Lady""---somewhat.
Yes, ""Lady of Burlesque"" is the better movie by far--but this one has its watchable moments.
Really, it isn't that bad. A good, rainy, Saturday afternoon movie to sit and compare---the ""Lady"" or the ""Queen"".",1428105600,2,751,5.155737704918033
8538183,1,B0099VUVZA,"Folks, there must be some mistake.  If this was a movie, we didn't watch it.  If it was a book, I don't have it nor have I ever read it.  thank you very much and sorry about that.  Sharen Peterson",1424476800,2,196,3.825
