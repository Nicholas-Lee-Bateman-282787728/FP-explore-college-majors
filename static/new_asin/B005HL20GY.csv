8473263,5,B005HL20GY,"This is a very famous legend/opera from the Chinese culture. I fell in love with this story as a kid growing up and had always wanted to watch a movie on it. My dream finally came true when I found that this DVD was available here on Amazon.

If you are knowledgeable about Chinese literature, then I really do not need to tell you this famous story. However, I can tell you that the quality of this DVD was excellent and I truly enjoyed it. The only problem is that this is a region 3 dvd, so if you are American, then you need to watch it on your computer or get yourself an all region dvd player. Its worth the investment if you enjoy these beautiful chinese films and its culture.",1344729600,2,684,4.181818181818182
