8325110,5,B000FQ54E6,"It is now a proven fact that meditation and visualization help speed up the healing process. This beautiful music and guided meditation helps both people involved heal themselves from the changes, trauma and stress that surgery brings. It is a true addition to the healing and taking responsibility for your own health dimension. This opportunity to rest and heal should be made available to all hospitals, healing centers, waiting rooms and surgeon's offices across the country. I feel this work can even help some people through emotional trauma, when they are suffering loss and heartache.",1161734400,,592,5.242105263157895
