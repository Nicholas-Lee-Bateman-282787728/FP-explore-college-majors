2173826,5,B00067HP0A,"As I am the first to review this, let me say that this is an awesome fun workout.  Definitely intermediate to advanced.  There's much variety with this DVD.  There's a choice of just doing the 32 min cardio, which is just using the step.  Then there's a choice of the 32 minute weights.  Lastly there's a choice of the full 56 minute workout, which can also be broken down with the a la carte menu...

Warm-up: 5 1/2min

Cardio: 32 min (w/warm-up)

Weights: 32  min (w/warm-up)

Abs: 6 min

Butt/Legs: 3 3/4 min

Cool down: 3 3/4 min

I'm new to KV and this is my second DVD of hers.  My first is her Great weighted workout which is also really intense. The background to this Ultimate Step Circuit is a barn like set up but who cares, the workout is fun and the music is upbeat.  She cues you in to all the moves.  There's one guy and a girl, who may have been in her earlier workouts.  You need a step and one set of heavy (5-10lbs) and one set of lighter (3-5lbs) weights.  When u do the total workout, you do first cardio/weights combo...it's nice the way she breaks it down.  KV is sooooooo defined and toned.  Just to give u an idea of my level of workouts, I alternate with this DVD, and KV great weighted workout, Tamilee Webbs Weight Loss, Bootcamp and Crunch Pilates...all fun workouts.  I hope all the dedicated exercisers buy this DVD or preview it on Collage.  Always preview so you know what you're getting.  I definitely give this 5 stars.",1107475200,33,1454,4.323420074349443

2173878,5,B00067HP0A,This is by far the best aerobic and total body workout tape I've used.  And I was an aerobics instructor for 6+ years and taught personal training at Nautilus Fitness Centers for several years.  I would highly recommend this video for someone who likes to work out HARD and really work up a sweat to the point their calves are soaked by the end of the video.  Really excellent video - but not one you should do every day because your joints will feel it which is not good.  I would suggest every other day or 3 times a week as being sufficient to stay in good shape.,1298332800,,566,4.212962962962963
2173879,5,B00067HP0A,"Yes it's true it take a little bit to get used too, but i think this is true for all workout DVDS.  If you can stick it out 10 times you'll get to know it and really enjoy it.  Even if you're a beginner you can modify the level, or do parts of the dvd and build up to it.  I've had this for 3 years now and it's definatley one of my favourites. She isn't annoying and the routines are good, i haven't really gotten bored with it either.  I use it once a week, and use other dvds on other days.",1288569600,,493,3.7572815533980584
2173880,5,B00067HP0A,"A challenging workout for intermediate steppers. Takes a few goes to get the co-ordination happening, but isn't too difficult. Not dancey moves, which is great, and get a good sweat up.",1279843200,,185,5.0
2173881,3,B00067HP0A,"I LOVE the moves in the cardio workout, but they are just a little too fast.  I've been stepping for a long time and I'm in decent shape, but it's difficult for me to keep up while maintaining good form.
Some people might like this, but I don't like a 30-minute workout.  I feel like I just get sweating and it's over.
I agree with everyone who says the cues are lousy.  Now that I've done it many times, I know what's coming, but if you rely on vocal cues, this workout's not for you.
This workout would be hugely improved if it were slowed down just a touch and were 15 minutes longer.",1270512000,,587,4.131578947368421
2173882,3,B00067HP0A,This could be a good workout. This woman goes very fast so if you are a beginner don't spend the money. I'm not real happy with this purchase.,1264809600,,142,4.107142857142857
2173883,5,B00067HP0A,"Es un DVD muy facil de seguir y aunque en Ingles lo disfrute mucho, la secuencias te permiten hacer ejercio en poco tiempo y sin mucha complicaciones. lo recomiendo mucho",1254355200,,170,4.7
2173884,4,B00067HP0A,"I like this video because you can do the entire video or choose to complete the strength section alone or the cardio section.  There isn't a lot of unnecessary peppiness from the instructor or a catch phrase she uses which can drive me crazy with other workout tapes.  I feel like I get a godo work out, although it's obviously not the same as going to a class at the gym.",1249776000,,372,4.225352112676056
2173885,5,B00067HP0A,"I love this simple to follow step workout.  As a two left footed person who likes to step, but who cannot follow when complicated dance moves are introduced, I really appreciate this workout.  She does a great job with the cues when changing moves, and I like her non-Denise Austin-way of praising (I hate Denise Austin).  As I said, the moves are very simple, specially if you are not new to stepping, and it will not take you that long to master the moves.

That said, what I like the best of all about this video is the fact that, you can see Karen and the crew sweating just as much as you are sweating.  I hate those workouts where the participants do not shed a ounce of sweat, while you are drenched.",1248048000,2,707,4.285714285714286
2173886,1,B00067HP0A,"I've always considered myself to be one of Karen Voight's biggest fans but I really hated this DVD.  The steps were too tricky and done too quickly.  There was no time to get used to a segment before she was on to the next one which was confusing and frustrating.

And the music, annoying and repetitive with an occasional yelping sound that drove me nuts.

Thank goodness for Amazon's low prices and Prime shipping so at least I didn't spend a lot of money on this.",1235433600,3,466,4.383720930232558
2173927,3,B00067HP0A,"This DVD is incredibly frustrating at first, Karen moves quickly and without warning making it hard to keep up with her.  The first few times through the DVD, I got so frustrated that I turned this workout off and popped in my old DVD routine.

After patience and many more tries, I got accustomed to her routine and was able to keep up.  It's a high intensity work out; it will definitely get your heart pounding!  She does alot of jumping and working over the step.

All in all, this workout is not for someone who hopes to pop the DVD in and get into the `flow of things' right off the bat.  But if you have patience to keep trying time after time, it is worth it!",1225756800,3,667,4.171875
2173928,5,B00067HP0A,This is a great workout. It is definately an advanced workout but if you can stick to it it is great.,1225152000,,101,3.857142857142857
2173929,2,B00067HP0A,"I did not have a step but i thought it would be ok, its not.  Without a step this video is useless.  I used it once when i first got it and haven't touched it since.  I do not even remember sweating when doing it.",1219104000,,213,3.688888888888889
2173930,4,B00067HP0A,"I bought this video because after trying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathy-Kaehler-Basics-Workout-Class/dp/B00068WRNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathy Kaehler Basics - Workout Class</a>&nbsp;I became a fan of step workouts.
I needed some variety to add more options to my cardio and strenght training, in order not to get bored, and this workout has both.

This is a good one for your collection if you look for some variety like me and you already have some experience working out.

I think this DVD is aimed for an intermediate/advanced exerciser who is familiar with step to be able to do the cardio circuit, otherwise you might be disappointed 'cause it is really hard to follow, at least in the beginning when you are not familiar with the moves.

It took me some time to be able to follow it, cause it's fast and Karen doesn't cue very much! Or she does it when she is already in the next move which is a little bit confusing for me. I think this is a very fun workout once you learn the moves, and Oh my! I sweat like crazy!

The strength training is very complete, but I don't like that you have to use a step mat which I don't have.
I wasn't too crazy about the stretch part, which in my opinion was hard to do and too short. I prefer something more traditional that allows you to relax more.",1218758400,2,1348,4.8478260869565215
2173931,1,B00067HP0A,This is more about building muscle than getting a good cardio workout. You also need a lot more room than I have to do some of the moves she's showing here. Found her really annoying.,1218412800,,183,4.257142857142857
2173932,4,B00067HP0A,"Overall, this is another great workout by Karen Voight. I'd be in better shape if I had been doing the workout regularly.

One thing I don't like about this workout is that it asks for 2 different sets of hand weights: a light set and a heavy set. A light pair of dumbells was sufficient for me.

Although the themed sections provide variety, some of the moves required too many reps, causing me to lose interest at some points. Perhaps it's just my cheap equipment or lack of coordination, but I also felt as though some of the moves were dangerous. I have almost slipped off of, or missed the platform many times.

Other than suggesting less equipment, making some of the moves safer, and  including more stretches in the cool down, there is nothing I would really change about this complete cardio/toning workout.",1216339200,,816,4.645833333333333
2173933,3,B00067HP0A,"I got this after I finished taking an aerobics class to keep with it, and I thought it was okay after several tries, but it's definitely more advanced than I was ready for.  I've used it a few times, but often get frustrated and just turn on some music for my cardio circuit instead. I read all the great reviews, but nothing (at the time) was mentioned about it being for a more advanced stepper.  My issues with it (as a beginning-intermediate stepper) were that she switched to new choreography too quickly and often without a good explanation of what she was doing (mostly during cardio circuit, she's better at describing during the strength circuit). I also felt like I had to keep my eye on the TV the whole time because there weren't enough audio cues, which is really difficult when you're constantly switching directions. By the time I figured out one step, she'd moved on to something else, so I wasn't getting a complete workout. I'm sure it's fine for advanced steppers or maybe just more coordinated people, but I'm going to try a different video for now.",1214092800,14,1069,4.621052631578947
2173934,4,B00067HP0A,"This is a great aerobic workout for a strong intermediate or advanced person when it comes to teh cardio (and abs section).  The aerobic circuit is a great challenge but not impossile.  I am always sweating profusely after this workout.  You have the option of doing teh entire circuit alternating between cardio and weight training for a total of 56 minutes or doing each circuit separately at about half an hour each.  I liek doing the full circuit becasue it works almost like interval training, and it keeps the workout from getting boring.  I also like the workout because Karen incorporates som moves on the step I have never seen before and she transitions a lot to keep you from getting bored.  The abs section is a real toughie becasue it is done on your step at an incline.  You definitely feel the burn.

My reason for giving a 4 instead of a 5 is that she doesn't cue very well, so the first time you do it, it is a little challenging to follow.  Also, I feel that the weight training portion should be more difficult.",1212364800,,1030,4.46524064171123
2173935,4,B00067HP0A,"This workout makes me work hard, which I need. I'm 53 and in pretty good shape. It was hard to follow Karen at first, but the second time around, I was right in step with her. I was already into weights before I got this DVD, so the weight portion wasn't a challenge at first. After raising my weights a bit (she recommends 3-5 and 5-8, so I do 8's and 10's) I saw an immediate difference! If you want to sweat and burn calories, this DVD will do it. Love it.",1202688000,,459,4.0
2173936,4,B00067HP0A,"I love this step workout! It took me a few times to get the hang of all the steps, but now I feel like I know it by heart. As other reviewers have noted, there are a few times where Karen starts a step before she cues the viewer in, but after just a couple times of doing this workout, you get the hang of it.

Personally, I'm not as crazy about the weight segments. The great thing about this DVD, though, is you can select which segments to do. I usually just do the three cardio circuits in a row and then do my own free weights. I also own Elle MacPherson's ""Your Personal Best"" video which features Karen. I'm familiar with her style of exercises and enjoy her coaching and fun, upbeat workouts.",1183593600,,700,4.185185185185185
2173958,4,B00067HP0A,"You can always count on Karen Voight to give you a well-developed workout and Ultimate Step Circuit is no exception.  I bought it because I was hoping that I'd get a great step workout from an instructor that brings a lot of positives to the field of video exercise.  Unfortunately, there's only about 30 minutes of stepping and even when I chose the option where you do all the step segments at once, I couldn't hit my target heart rate for long enough to make it worthwhile.  Likewise when I chose the combo (step segments alternating with toning) option on the DVD. But it's still a good overall workout option (vs. sitting on your couch and eating Cheetos) from one of the best instructors out there.",1183334400,,704,4.571428571428571
2173959,5,B00067HP0A,"This workout is excellent to move, tone, sweat it all. You feel every muscle working, and Karen is very good explaining the moves.

I have a complete collection (taebo, zumba, step) and this is one of my favorites because I know I'm working everything with it.",1181174400,,260,4.6521739130434785
2173960,4,B00067HP0A,"Its was good overall workout. It was easy to follow not alot of complicated dance moves. I liked the weight segments throughout, was a nice variation. Some of the positions on the bench for stretching I didn't care for, position bothered my knee. So I did it on the floor. I enjoyed it.",1179187200,,286,4.415094339622642

2173962,5,B00067HP0A,"Karen Voight is excellent in this DVD on multiple levels.  She cues early enough, but not too early.  Her techinque is impeccable - always reminding you of proper form so as to avoid injury. Her cardio is challenging, and she offers varying levels of intensity.  Her weight training is awesome, and always gives a good burn.  This DVD is one of my favorite b/c I always know I'm going to end up with a good workout in the end.  Being an aerobics instructor myself, I would say that Karen Voight is one of my favorites.  I have many of her workout DVDs.  She rocks.",1170547200,5,564,4.365384615384615
2173963,5,B00067HP0A,"The first time I tried this video, I was extremely annoyed - her cuing is absolutely awful on this one.  She tells you what she's doing next as she already starts doing it - no warning at all!  So the first couple times I did this video, I cursed her the whole time.  However, once I got it down, I realized that it is a really good, high-impact workout.  I have a lot of step videos, and this one keeps my heart rate higher than any of the rest.  It is really fast-paced, as other reviewers have mentioned.  You're definitely stepping quicker than in most other step videos, and the routines are strenuous, with a lot of jumps - however, you can usually substitute lower impact moves if you don't prefer to do the jumps.  As for the weight section, if you do it in conjunction with the step portions, it is somewhat difficult, because your heart rate gets up pretty high and then you go right into weight lifting - this makes the weight lifting parts seem hard because you're already huffing and puffing, but on their own, I don't feel like I get a good total body weight lifting workout from this video.  Some of the body parts are only worked on for a few minutes, and in moves that don't seem like they're doing much for me.  I recommend this video more for the step aerobics than for the weight portion.",1170201600,10,1308,4.327868852459017
2173964,4,B00067HP0A,"Karen Voight is one of the best trainers I have in my collection.  This one in particular is well rounded.  Karen is easy to follow and keeps you motivated.  I love step! and this one is good. If you don't like jumping on a step, don't get this one, but if you do, you'll love it.  I have done step for years and this workout still makes me sweat everytime. The circuit has great intervals and flows perfectly. Anything negative I could say is that it might need a little more weight training.

I'd recommend this, or honestly any Karen Voight workout.",1168819200,4,552,4.372549019607843
2173965,4,B00067HP0A,Overall not a bad workout video with more than one type of workout to choose from.  Fairly easy to follow but I would have enjoyed some more energizing music.  Karen is a good instructor but in this video I don't find her to be as motivating as I would have liked.,1156982400,2,264,4.1568627450980395
2173966,5,B00067HP0A,"I'm 35 years old and started stepping in the early 90's but I haven't stepped in 5 years. This workout took me a few workouts to catch on and if I had to give some advice to make it easier to learn I would say...set the step up so you're facing the TV and mirror her feet and body to get the moves. I was really confused trying to decipher left and right and when I mirrored her, I got it instantly!  I got this DVD because of the great reviews and doing this workout brought all the reasons I used to love to step back and made me sweat. I'm not very articulate with giving a review and I rarely do but I have to say, in the past 7 days of doing this workout (everyday because I'm addicted!) I have trimmed down a great deal and I'm more relaxed and happy. Probably just a release of good endorphins from doing something that is thoroughly enjoyable. I love it and just thought it deserved some credit.",1152489600,8,903,4.101694915254237
2173967,4,B00067HP0A,"It took me about three sessions to be able to follow the whole routine. Sometimes she goes to the next move without much of an intro. But once I ""got it"", I loved it! This is definitely for the intermediate or advanced stepper. Karen Voight does it right - warm up, aerobics, heavy weights, aerobics, light weights, aerobics, abs, and cool down. It is a lot of fun and the hour goes so fast, you are done before you know it! I highly recommend this DVD.",1152057600,4,453,4.27906976744186
2173998,5,B00067HP0A,"Oh my gosh, this is probably one of the best workout DVD's EVER and I'm addicted to The Firm.  The instructor is upbeat and she is REAL... she's even SWEATING along with the rest of us.  There are nO thong leotards to be seen, and each exercise was easy to follow... I love the movements, everything.
I recommend, however, that if you're relatively new to step, WATCH each segment for a minute to figure out the step routine and then rewind and try it yourself.
Also, if a move is tricky, try it on the floor before going up on the step.  When you're trying to learn a new move - Like I was with this DVD - it's safer and easier to try the steps on the floor.  This was extremely easy to follow and I really enjoyed it!  I can't wait to work out to it tonight.  :)",1150675200,6,764,4.06
2173999,5,B00067HP0A,"Because I exercise at home rather than a gym, I need motivation, fun and yet a tough enough instructor to make me sweat.  Karen is such an instructor.  She is such a clear cuer and talks ahead of the next move so you know what's comming up.

This workout alternates fast cardio intervals with toning moves.  They are tough but worth it.  The aerobic intervals are between 7-9 minutes and each one gets a little tougher.  The toning segments are shorter but work multi muscle groups.  There is a great workout for the abs that will kill.  You'll need for the workout some dumbells, and a lot of energy.  This is a great workout to do often as you will definately get the results you want.  I love this workout.",1145664000,9,709,4.384615384615385

I've seen some with poor cueing, and others I do long enough that it's time to move on to something new.  I'm not sure how to pinpoint or put words to my impression of this, but Karen seemed very unreal, and I want something more down to earth.  I like seeing strong women that I would like to be more like, and while the guy and gal in the back were fine, Karen was just too annoying up front.",1135123200,10,544,3.963302752293578

- a challenging weight workout

- almost a full hour!  I am tired of tapes that SAY they are an hour, but the workout is only 40 mintes!

CONS:

- poor cueing makes the workout hard to follow the first few times, but once you get the hang of it you will be one step agead of her!",1132358400,,392,3.8860759493670884

2174005,4,B00067HP0A,"I've used this DVD about five times now and am finally appreciating the benefits.  It wasn't love at first sight - I was very frustrated the first couple times and even quit midway. In the cardio sequences, Karen often starts a new move before giving the signal, leaving you stranded behind your step.  It's very off-putting.  Nevertheless, I forced myself to hang with it and am glad I did. As other reviewers mentioned, the complete workout (55 min) is a nice challenge for an intermediate exerciser. I'm starting to be able to anticipate her moves so the poor cueing is becoming less of an issue.

The weight-training component is unique, which keeps me interested (not your standard bicep curls...) and targets areas that my other DVDs do not (see my other reviews).  However, I really have to pay attention to form (not that that's a bad thing) - some of the moves are unusual and a bit tricky; others are very subtle movements, requiring concentration to feel a burn.  Also, there aren't many reps so you have to make the most of each.

I find that the pacing on the step movements is unusually fast (normally, I want to move at the same speed or faster than the instructor).  One one hand, I like that this routine makes me hustle but it's harder to keep good form and a bit taxing on the body.  So I do not recommend it for someone who wants to minimize the impact on joints.

The music, set, and background are neutral to good - nothing amazing but not drawbacks.  I like that the set is simple and well-lit and that there are only two people behind Karen. I haven't noticed any poor form on their part, which helps me to concentrate on mine.  The overall mood is serious/professional but they'll flash a smile here and there.

I'd say this is a high-intermediate/low-advanced workout because the cardio movements are so rapid. By the final cardio sequence (""the tick/tock"") I am approaching my breaking point.  Karen works up a sweat in this workout, which I find comforting. Both the warm-up and cool-down (before abs) should be a couple minutes longer. The ability to split the DVD into two workouts - 34 minute cardio and 32 minute weight-training is a nice feature. While it has its issues, this DVD is a good value at around $10.",1121644800,65,2244,4.591478696741855

I find this DVD helps me to achieve my goal as a part of my exercise routine.  It consists of both cardio and strength for 30 min each.  I found the Strength Circuit may be a little too easy and short.  The Cardio Circuit on the other hand provides good sweat, not for beginner.  Interestingly the concept of this cardio section is slightly similar to the gKathy Smith: Power Step Workouth!!

8039774,3,B00067HP0A,I didn't really like Karen Voight's teaching style or her choreographed moves.  This DVD is just okay.  I would prefer to do other workouts before this one.,1509321600,,156,4.7407407407407405
8039775,5,B00067HP0A,"I can't seem to find any new step workouts, so I took a chance on this older one, and was really happy that I did.  It's an excellent workout, and not too complicated.  I have purchased two other step workouts that I had to give away because they were ridiculously complicated, poorly cued, and I felt that I was wasting my workout time re-winding the dvd constantly.  With this step workout by Karen Voigt, I had to re-wind a couple of times to get a move down straight, but it was a minor inconvenience.  The workout was interesting and fun to do, and I know my body had a great exercise session.",1505692800,,598,4.3125
8039776,5,B00067HP0A,"Challenging workout.  The step part can be a bit fast so you have to be alert or lower your step.  Good strengthening exercises.
You can do just the strength or just the step or 2x the cardio or however you want to do the workout.  So that is very nice.  Prepare to sweat.",1482969600,,272,4.0754716981132075
8039777,4,B00067HP0A,"Good dvd, i just wish they would slow down a bit b4 starting and give an introduction on what is going to happen. A bit fast paced for me, but after a few times, i'll get the hang of it.",1466467200,,186,3.675
8039778,4,B00067HP0A,"I'm giving this 4 stars because I really like my Karen Voight Circuit Training DVD, and that is EXACTLY what this DVD is, minus the ball workout.  So, if you already own Cardio Circuit....don't waste your time or money.  I REALLY wish people would STOP ""rebranding and renaming"" products from years ago.",1452816000,2,303,4.8076923076923075
8039779,4,B00067HP0A,"My review is only for the ""complete workout"". This dvd has different options/premixes you can choose from (like Cathe's dvds).

Workout Options (noted on back of DVD):

-Complete Circuit (56 min)-this is the one I am reviewing
-Cardio Circuit (32 min)
-Strength Circuit (32 min)
-A La Carte Segments (""If you're short on time, the A La Carte menu brings you straight to the segments you want most"")-time not noted. This is most likely where you can choose exactly what parts to do from the whole dvd. :)

I love Karen Voight and I own many of her workouts. I like that her step and aerobics are not too complicated or dancey which is why I often choose her workouts to do for the day!

The warm up is nice and not too long. The step is more basic than Cathe's so its easy to follow if you are not new to step. If you are new to step, then you may need to rewind a few times, but the steps are very easy to follow just after the 1st try. I felt like the step circuit combos went by really fast. They weren't too high impact to me, but more of a good solid intermediate. You can always modify by using a higher inch step (I used a 6 inch and still got a good workout).

The weight segments weren't too long, but she works them well considering the short amount of time you are working them. I felt the burn really good with the shoulder segment! :)

The abs segment and short lower body (done on the step) were also very good and challanging. Time flew by really fast with this one! Her cuing was off a few times which is only why I gave it 4 stars, but it wasn't too bad where you couldn't keep up. ;) Remember, if you are a Cathe fan, then you would know that her step is way more complicated and sometimes it would take me 4 times of doing the workout until I really could follow without having to stop and rewind! ;)

Overall solid A and great workout. I felt refreshed and not out of breath with this one but still felt a great burn!",1391472000,3,1936,4.132978723404255
8039780,5,B00067HP0A,"She's the best trainer anyway.  Her body alone is an inspiration.  WIsh the program was 30 minutes, shorter version.  Still good.",1389052800,,129,5.0476190476190474
8039781,5,B00067HP0A,"I chose this rating because
1. I found this product on amazon
2. The sellers were prompt and INCLUDED a bill of sale in their package.
(not like another product I bought)
3. The product was in great condition when I bought it,
Karen Voight's training beats them all.",1372636800,,266,4.448979591836735
8039782,5,B00067HP0A,"A little energetic and intense if you haven't done the step for a while, nevertheless a good, clear, thorough step workout.  Nice pleasant people and atmosphere with the visuals.  I still prefer the Gin Miller original step workout, but can't seem to purchase the CD for it.",1355097600,,274,4.808510638297872
