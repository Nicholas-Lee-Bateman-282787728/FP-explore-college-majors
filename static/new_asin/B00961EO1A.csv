5272263,5,B00961EO1A,"Somewhere in the collective consciousness of those of us who grew up with Sesame Street is a sense of hope, of being able to live together with one another in ways that are creative, emancipatory, and rhythmical.  This collection allows the political and social hope that was Sesame Street to shine through even more clearly than the previous volumes.  Beginning with the show in which Maria goes back to Puerto Rico, the cast and the shows allow us to remember how often Sesame Street showed urban and rural images often side by side, providing a lived experience of togetherness within a nation that was often on edge over its diversity.

The music of Joe Raposo, and the montage of images shown with his songs, also contributed to a mood and a depth that has been unmatched in the last 30 or so seasons since.  Look at the song about 2 (pairs of people) or about family.  Look at the connections Raposo makes between animals and humans.  Truly, something deep and lasting in melody, in images, and in philosophy.

What happened after the late 80s to this show?  Was it that the entire PBS came under attack?  Was it that the show's writers and PhDs who advised (and I think controlled) content felt that they had to cowtow to a certain political group that was not in power in the 70s?  Whatever the reasons for the shift, and I for one think it was profound, the truth is that these three volumes remain a kind of collective memory to a show that allowed us to see one another as beautiful, strong, and creative people.

If you care about your children's future in a world hungering for friendship and community; if you want to remember what it looked like when people were not polished, when Roosevelt Franklin spoke like an African American unabashedly and bravely, when Spanish was not introduced in single words but in whole sentences, when the Muppets were neither controlling adults nor alarming 2-year olds (Elmo)--then you need to get this set of discs.

Sometime in the future, if not already, there will be college courses on this show.  Perhaps some of us can write the material now.  This show deserves it (at least it used to).

For those of us who loved the music of Joe Raposo, the work and humor of Jim Henson, and the melting pot of diversity that the Street in the 70s gave us--thank you Sesame Street.  We may have to pay you now for getting back our memories, our country and our togetherness.  But that makes up in a way for our not having to pay you then.

Please make all episodes and skits available after you have parceled out these collections.  There is still more to see!",1352332800,41,2603,4.559139784946237

Each volume only includes one episode per season, and sadly they reuse so many sketches. It would seem that if you only get 5 episodes to cover 5 seasons, you might not see the same song 2-3 times. Some of the sketches even show up again in other volumes.

At least it did have the letter and number sponsor as well as the various Muppet or human cast member holding the Sesame Street and CTW signs at the end of each show. The creepy PBS vanity plate also makes an appearance. I also felt that the story arcs of Maria's visit to Puerto Rico and Big Bird's stay at summer camp should have had their own DVD sets or should have been made available on this set as an extra bonus. Overall I did enjoy it. I loved watching the episodes, singing the songs, and cried all over again when they told Big Bird that Mr. Hooper had died and wasn't coming back.

5272305,2,B00961EO1A,"ow would you feel if the highlights of your favorite show as a child were reduced to 1 DVD per year (as Sesame Street Old School is)? Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras? This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1. Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?

The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD... On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and all the great characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids). In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.

But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little? One episode per year???? A dozen or so extra bits per year????? Three of the twelve bits are simply actors saying the alphabet. Although it's neat to see well-known actors from 30-some years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).

These compilations held so much promise. My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",1395705600,2,1563,4.676363636363637

It's a NICE collection, don't get me wrong, but in MY opinion, Volume 3 could have had some better episodes. Maybe some that would actually grab someone's attention. Also, the fact that a couple of the episodes were edited definitely took away the originality of each one. Even the THEME SONG was left out! I'm sure it sucks when you can't even release your own ORIGINAL material without any copyright or clearance issues behind it. I have to be honest when I say that a few of the episodes in this volume were actually kind of dull to me and could've been left out of the collection. Like the one where Madeline Kahn played a bird watcher - No offense to the Old School SS fans, I LOVE Madeline and I always have, but that episode was a bit BO-RING!! The one where Big Bird goes to camp, I feel they should've just left that one out as well because if I remember correctly, it was broken up into about 4 or 5 parts when it first aired on TV. So why would they just put PART ONE on the DVD and not include the others? It just makes the DVD feel incomplete. Overall, it seemed like Volume 3 was kind of rushed. The episode that I really and truly enjoyed was the one where Maria celebrates her birthday in Puerto Rico.

5272326,3,B00961EO1A,"Sesame Street was always a classic, subversive children's show that continues to teach the curriculum in new and interesting ways even today. This DVD demonstrates in how classy these lessons could be executed, without having to resort to the loudness, inanity and pointless exercises existing in later shows such as Dora the Explorer and the Teletubbies. I can't speak for purposes of nostalgia, unfortunately -- I was born several years after these episodes were first transmitted, and my mother had already outgrown Sesame Street by this stage.

However, classic Sesame has a one-up to current Sesame in how it presented ABC's and 123's. It did so in a relaxed, loose manner (line flubs and all) that brought its liberal ideals and cultural pluralism to the forefront. As Sonia Manzano mentions in the audio commentary for the season 12 premiere episode, guests were most likely picked for possessing ideals reflected in that of the show. It's strange knowing that, considering Chris Brown was on an episode waaaaaaay back in 2006. All in all, the episodes themselves provide great viewing for those who want to reflect on a much simpler time.

I think most of the reviewers before have iterated on the problems presented within this set. Yes, there's no theme song. No opening titles. Nup, no, nada. It's not a glitch that causes the DVD to skip to the main episode, because the music is edited out in some instances where it should be played. This is strange, considering one can still hear the music played in the background at the beginning of the episodes and over the closing sponsors (it should be noted there is no ""funky chimes"" music either). There's no moment of clarity when one episode ends and another begins. Ah, well.

With Volume Three, Sesame Workshop is continuing with its tried-and-tested formula of one premiere episode per season, plus some notable clips introduced that year. However, this method doesn't always seem to work. Two of the episodes (the Season 12 opener where Maria and the gang travel to Puerto Rico and the Season 14 opener where Big Bird goes to Camp Echo Rock) begin week-long story arcs. This is okay for the Season 12 premiere, because at least that episode ends with some sort of resolution - Maria gets a huge shock from her friends after they surprise her in Puerto Rico, and they throw a big party for her birthday. But the very last shot we see of episode 1207 is Big Bird entering his cabin. What about the character development? What about his relationship with that contrarian kid who wouldn't even shake hands with him? We want to know what happens, goshdangit!

The best part of the DVD are the the bonus features, which unfortunately are fewer than previous DVDs. There's a massive cutback on the bonus clips, and the ones included aren't particularly interesting or funny. But the DVD makes up for it with its other special features - some behind-the-scenes footage, an audio commentary from Sonia Manzano on the Season 12 premiere (she barely remembered anything about the episode but it was insightful nonetheless) and not one, but TWO featurettes involving Carroll Spinney. The first one is a delightful interview abut the history of Big Bird and Oscar, from their development to Snuffy's Big Reveal in Season 18. The second is an in-character reading as Oscar the Grouch of the book ""How to be a Grouch"". Warning: don't watch this at a time where people in your place of dwelling are still sleeping, because I guarantee it will take you all your available energy to prevent yourself from laughing out loud.

All in all, this is a nice omnibus, and it's worth getting for the bonus material exclusive to the DVD, but you're better of watching the episodes on YouTube. At least they come with the episode titles.",1359072000,5,3773,4.843410852713179

5272330,5,B00961EO1A,Big Sesame Street fan and I have been looking for this DVD to complete my collection.  It arrived in perfect condition and a great transacation.,1355443200,,144,4.76
5272331,1,B00961EO1A,"What you are buying here is 4 episodes of sesame street with a handful a 3 minute long clips.  This is a rip off for the price for many reasons.

Seasons 1 and 2 of Old School (which I purchased through Amazon.com for my two year old daughter) contain a disclaimer at the beginning of each disk stating that this material is not suitable for children today - disgusting.  I was raised on this exact material and love who I am and the fond memories of early sesame street - not this watered down urban PC stuff they broadcast today.  We wouldn't dream of letting our daughter watch current sesame street.  However, I feel I was taken advantage of purchasing seasons 1 and 2 and will not do it again.

As previous reviewers mentioned, there is quite a repetition of earlier broadcast materials (such as the number two songs) over and over again - which leads this to be much less a value than is marketed.

I recommend not buying this as it is just a ploy to milk our pockets for memories.  Give me a season with complete episodes or go home.",1354579200,11,1040,4.352331606217617
5272332,4,B00961EO1A,"Right after i received Sesame Street school Vol. 3 in the mail, I quickly searched thru all 5 episodes, and right away noticed that the theme song with those well known lyrics, ""Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street""?, is EDITED OUT of all 5 Episodes. UNBELIEVEABLE! Volume's 1 and 2 didn't have that problem, so why now Volume 3. That is my guess as to why it took so long to release Volume 3. Maybe it was possibly found out that buying the rights to the theme song was gonna cost too much money.

Don't let that keep you from buying SSOS Vol. 3, cuz if you grew up with it, there is always great vintage material to look back on. More than one time, i ran across the PINBALL NUMBER COUNT about the number 2. That's ok with me, cuz I like the song. The song with the TWO GIRLS AND A LITTLE DOLL HOUSE is in this set. I know that one was in an earlier set. Segments repeated over the years, so we wouldn't forget. I saw at least a couple KERMIT THE FROG NEWS FLASH segments, like about the OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE. The old woman quickly put Kermit in charge and told the kids, ""Go to bed when the frog tells you"". I laughed good at that one. There was also GUY SMILEY and those game show segments.

It would have been nice to have more BONUS material segments is this set. Each season premiere episode had about 5 or 6 bonus segments, which was good but not enough stuff. Included was the clip where Big Bird was told that Mr. Hooper died and couldn't ever come back. I remember that when I was about 7 or 8. Also included inside the set is a very nice thick booklet with plenty of good stuff to read about the show. It it very fascinating and enjoyable!

All in all, plenty of great material. Worth getting for sure, but a word of warning that the theme song is edited out of all episodes.",1353283200,33,1815,4.092696629213483
5272333,3,B00961EO1A,"This third installment of the ""Old School"" DVD series covers seasons 11-15 (1979-84) of Sesame Street.  Like previous installments, it features each season's premiere episode, along with a selection of ""classic cuts"" from each season, and some other bonus material.  Unfortunately, this release is a step down from volumes 1 and 2 - not because the show itself declined in quality (it's still classic Sesame Street all the way), but because of a decrease in bonus material and a VERY glaring ommission that occurs in every episode included.

As it is, the previous volumes already had some minor issues.  While the formula of including five (nearly) complete episodes and a selection of clips is not a bad one, I don't think that the season premieres were necessarily the best episodes to include, especially since many of them repeated the same segments (particularly ones about the number 2).  This set actually features some episodes with a different number sponsor, but there's now another problem: two of the episodes are actually the beginning of week-long story arcs (the trip to Puerto Rico in season 11, and Big Bird going to camp in season 14).  So in this case, I think it would have been better to include episodes that stood more on their own.

Another issue with previous sets is that some material had to be cut or replaced due to music or other clearance issues.  This continues with volume 3, but here's where it gets really puzzling: apparently this time they couldn't clear the rights to their own theme song!  All five episodes are presented without their original opening sequence, and a few other occurrences of the theme within the episodes were also edited out.  There is some solace in that the instrumental harmonica version of the theme still appears at the beginning and end of each story.  But nonetheless, this is a very glaring omission that makes the episodes feel incomplete, and I'm at a loss as to why there would be an issue with the song.

Finally, there is a significant cutback in bonus clips, possibly due to the reduction from three discs to two.  If you look at Volume 2, each season featured at least nine ""classic cuts"", and season six in particular featured nearly twenty.  For this set, we only get five for each season, a number of which were already released on previous collection.  Also, likely due to a combination of the reduction in discs and the aforementioned theme song issues, we do not get the Friday credit crawls from each season as we did in the previous sets.  While I would not consider the credits to be essential, I and other fans do have a fascination with the way they evolved over the years, and was hoping to find out when the long-running sequence with Barkley and the kids in the park debuted.  That said, there are a handful of rare gems featuring lesser-known characters like Dr. Nobel Price and Warren Wolf, as well as some nice bonus features including an exclusive interview with Caroll Spinney (Big Bird/Oscar), and commentary from Sonia Manzano (Maria) on the season 11 Puerto Rico episode.

Your satisfaction with this release will ultimately depend on how much of a completist you are.  Although there were some minor issues with the previous sets, they were complete enough to leave me satisfied.  However, I would not regard this one as a ""must buy"" due to the major cuts and relative lack of bonus features.  I actually would have been more satisfied if they just released a large collection of clips from this era - at least then I would know not to expect the full experience of watching a complete episode, and there would probably be more rare material.  But those of you who just want to relive some classic early 80's Sesame Street moments will probably be more than content with this set.",1352764800,82,3778,4.762269938650307
