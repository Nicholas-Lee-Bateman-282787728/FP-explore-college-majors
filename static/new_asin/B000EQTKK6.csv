2530478,5,B000EQTKK6,"Ruy and Tito are two young musicians trying to make it in Cuba. They are presented a new opportunity when some Spanish record biz people show up. But the two friends find themselves facing a difficult choice when the contract offered requires them to record some anti-government songs which would prevent them from ever returning to their country.

It's hard to make a high quality ""up and coming rock band"" movie. But this film succeeds brillantly. This is partly because the original music played by the band is suprisingly good and the actors come across as serious and talented musicians. The depiction of life in Cuba seems realistic and the film accurately reflects the economic hardships faced by Cuban citizens without explicitly commenting on Castro himself.

My wife is originally from Ecuador and we watch alot of Spanish language films. But this has to be one of the better ones I've seen.",1226448000,,901,4.921052631578948
2530479,3,B000EQTKK6,"This is a marvelous film about young people living in today's Cuba.  It handles the subject matter with care and honesty, without descending into sentimentality.  Although funny at times, this movie is not a comedy.  Real life contradictions abound -- these people suffer and struggle, but at the same time have conflicted feelings about the possibility of leaving their home.  Their relationships are what makes this movie come to life.  The characters are fully fleshed out, and the acting is great. The music may surprise some -- it is cuban-style rock and roll, not Salsa.

My wife, whose family fled Cuba when she was an infant, thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  She was moved by the depiction of the struggles of Cubans living on the island.

Unfortunately, I cannot give this disc 5 stars.  It is non-anamorphic, something very surprising for a disc released in 2007.  The subtitles are ""hard-coded"" -- that is, you cannot turn them off (even if you speak Spanish.) And the special features are in Spanish, with no subtitles or alternate language track.",1222128000,2,1057,4.954545454545454
2530480,4,B000EQTKK6,"Interesting movie that shows a real face of Havana and it's people, daily struggle for work, money, live your dreams, the land line phone shared with a whole block of tenants - a lot of things that we don't appreciate in our society. I think that this movie make us review our life priorities and importance of simple pleasures in life.....",1200528000,,340,4.590163934426229
2530481,5,B000EQTKK6,"I first saw this movie when I was living in Spain.  It involves two of my favorite subjects, music and commerce.  I fell in love with this movie, and have been trying to hunt it down ever since.  Definitely worth it to get the English subtitles.  They speak fast for me at least!",1172620800,,279,4.2075471698113205
2530482,5,B000EQTKK6,"This is a marvelous movie. I have never been in Cuba but I think it gives a good image and feeling of this charming country.

The actors are great and the musics are fabulous. The movie is about 2h long but it seems too short. Excellent pictures, the story is perfect, this is moving. You can watch it with your kids and have long discussion after!

Worth watching it",1164067200,,367,4.304347826086956
2530483,5,B000EQTKK6,"This film poses the problem two friends face when trying to make it big time with their band: to leave or not to leave (the island of Cuba). The director goes thru the ifs and buts they are facing and treats the problem, which many Cubans suffer, with delicacy and sophistication, using the talent of the actors and a very well written plot.

Two thumbs up!!!",1162512000,,359,4.4393939393939394
2530484,5,B000EQTKK6,"This is such a great movie.  It follows a group of Cuban musicians as they try to make it big.  The cast of characters is very diverse, the music is FANTASTIC, and the story is both heartwrenching and uplifting by turns.  I highly reccommend this movie.  A great movie to watch in Spanish!",1145318400,,289,4.39622641509434

8113493,3,B000EQTKK6,"Interesting view of Cuba about 2005 but possibly getting a bit dated.
Music was great and views of life in Havana fantastic!",1389139200,,124,4.681818181818182
8113494,4,B000EQTKK6,"Great movie about the struggle to stay true to your beliefs versus musical success, keeping a family together and patriotism. I had seen this on tv a while back and fell in love with the movie and the final scenes which seem to be the climax of others moving on without you.",1341619200,,274,4.288461538461538
8113495,5,B000EQTKK6,"This first and foremost a fun, emotive,a nd well made film. It is also a great start for anyone who wishes to understand the paradoxes of modern Cuba.

Compare it to ""Buena Vista Social Club"", which is an inevitable analogue, and you get a more dramatic, albeit less idealistic project.

All in all, more than worth watching. My wife will be teaching it to her students (college-level kids) and it is also very well suited for that.",1264032000,,432,4.597402597402597
