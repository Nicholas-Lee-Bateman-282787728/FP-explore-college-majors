3857872,5,B002748SR4,I take my hat off to the Mel Bay group for producing this DVD. It is a close up intimate visit with one of the most talented guitarist of our time. The DVD is so well done that at the end I felt I had actually met Ana.,1325894400,2,218,3.5625
3857873,5,B002748SR4,I have a fairly nteresting clection of classical guitar CDs and videos. THis new one by Ana Vidovic is a nice addition. She is unquestionably a great talent and probably the most promising f the new guitar virtuosos. Her technique is impeccable and her musicality is superb. The Piazzola pieces are a chalenge but she masters them beautifuly. A pleasure to watch her play.,1323388800,,372,4.828125
3857874,5,B002748SR4,"This DVD is a must for any serious guitar player.  I have viewed it several times and could watch it over and over.  It is simply great music that is played from a lot of hard work and a lot of heart.
Ana is simply an example of what can be accomplished at a very young age with desire.  I would like to have watched this many years ago.
There are great close ups of both hands to demonstrate technique and the sound and video quality is excellent.  It is a bargan!",1320796800,6,465,4.021739130434782
3857875,5,B002748SR4,"Ana's total command of the guitar is impressive.  Beside her, anyone else seems like a bungling amateur.  Since discovering Ana, my list of guitar heroes has been revamped.",1305936000,,172,5.107142857142857
3857876,5,B002748SR4,"Ana gives an excellent performance.  I don't think I could ever see a more beautiful person play a guitar more beautifully.  Her hands move very graceful and full of artistic ability.

Too bad the camera cuts away from her looking into it to another camera angle, when she talks, without prompting her to look into the direction of the different camera angle so she would always be looking into the camera.  The camera is just fine though, while she is playing, getting good close-up angles and more distant angles, fading from one to another.

I think she has mastered the classics.  The thing I would really like is for her to play jazz/blues.  She says she has never improvised, which I think is an important next step in mastery, which is to create.

Appreciatively,
Lee",1289433600,,774,4.681481481481481
3857877,5,B002748SR4,"I never tire of watching this video. The camera shows her hands clearly as she plays, and you can really appreciate her artistry. Each finger seems to have a mind of its own, allowing her to control the tempo, volume, and all the details that make her music so artistic and beautiful.

The interview is a wonderful candid insight into the personality of this beautiful woman, and you get an idea of what her motivation and interests are, and how she works at her craft.

If, like me, you play guitar, you'll learn a great deal from this DVD. I would give it six stars if I could.",1284681600,21,579,4.351851851851852
3857878,5,B002748SR4,"Ana is a fantastic classical guitarist, and this is another fine example of her work. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an appreciation for classical guitar artistry at its finest!",1272412800,3,189,4.9375
3857879,5,B002748SR4,"I have been listening to Ana for some time. This Video is simply wonderful. The previous reviewer stated that Ana plays like an Angel, and it is true. She played quiet a few of these pieces when I saw her for the second time in Nov 2009. 5 stars. Come Back to Portland soon.",1268784000,2,274,4.092592592592593
3857880,5,B002748SR4,"This is a great DVD.
Ana plays like an Angel. The sound is great.
The interview with Ana gives interesting view on the life
of one of the best guitarists in the world.

I enjoyed every minute!",1256169600,5,192,4.1891891891891895
3857881,5,B002748SR4,"Gave this as a gift to my grandson. A talented musician in his own right, he really appreciated it. It shows the artists fingering technique in the video.",1391904000,,154,4.535714285714286
3857882,5,B002748SR4,This DVD is lovely.  Ms. Vidovic is a very talented woman.  As this was a gift and it arrived exactly as promised I am very pleased with both the product and service.  Thank you.,1389052800,,178,4.176470588235294
3857883,5,B002748SR4,Easy listening is what you will get with Ana !  This young lady plays a guitar like no other.  Watch her just once and you will be as hooked as i am.  She is quite a phenomenon.,1386806400,,177,3.72972972972973
3857884,5,B002748SR4,"Ana Vidovic was already the best living classical guitarist anywhere.  But in listening to these collected performances I now have an even deeper and richer concept of her wonderfulness!  She is well worth a listen, even if you never heard classical guitar.",1380672000,,257,5.095238095238095
3857885,4,B002748SR4,"A new experience, having the music and artist recorded live on DVD.  It's nice to see the artist going about their work, and it's certainly a pleasure watching Ana Vidovic perform, though it's different from being at a live performance and I think the attempt is to make it a bit more personal for the viewer.

Very fine performances and I look forward to collecting more of her work in the future.  Fortunately, as one of the group of mature yet still young performing artists she has many more years ahead of her.  Definitely worth buying.",1374969600,,541,4.604166666666667
3857886,5,B002748SR4,"Ana Vidovic is a true master of the classical guitar. Oh, did I mention she's really lovely too! Buy the DVD",1368921600,,108,4.190476190476191
3857887,4,B002748SR4,"I have many CD's and DVD's. Ana Vidovic is very accomplished, however not quite at the level of Christopher Parkening or Ricardo Cobo. But still very enjoyable.",1357948800,,160,4.962962962962963
3857888,5,B002748SR4,"I have seen Ana grow and mature as a guitarist over the years.  She is a beautiful player and has connected her feelings to the performances, which make it a dynamite performance.",1347840000,2,179,4.59375
3857889,4,B002748SR4,"Ana Vidovic is a brilliant guitarist, and this DVD is a delight to listen too.  Unfortunately the videography is amateurish, with constant viewpoint changes, pans, zooms, what have you that are very distracting.  They would have been better off just pointing a fixed camera at her and leaving it.  Too bad, because the setting was beautiful, the scenes well staged, and each of Ms. Vidovic's many outfits (which changed with almost every number) was lovely.",1346371200,4,457,5.066666666666666
3857890,5,B002748SR4,"Love this DVD, being able to see Ana play and to hear her interview is and will continue to inspire me for many years to come I am sure.",1339718400,2,136,3.7241379310344827

8353881,5,B002748SR4,Be still my heart.  Ana's left-hand accuracy is something to aspire to.  I have thoroughly enjoyed her interpretations.,1423785600,,119,5.555555555555555
8353882,2,B002748SR4,"I endorse the other reviewers' comments on Ana Vidovic's level of performance on this DVD which to say the least was awesome!  I had the opportunity to listen to her playing on CDs; I was so impressed that I bought this DVD because I wanted to relish her playing.  But unfortunately I was disappointed with the quality of the images on this DVD.  The problem came primarily from the editor; they chose to make an exaggeration with regard to the superposition of images while the artist was playing.  Over and above, the images being shot  very often at the wrong angles.  These were most inappropriate as it is tiring for the eyes of the viewers.  They seem to have forgotten that guitar aficionados would be interested to watching the performer's at work and NOT their poor images quality and editing.  It would appear that we had affair with amateurs cameramen and editors; this could be seen by the low quality of the images of that beautiful chapel at the start of the DVD:  the images were shaking!  I'm sorry for Ana.  Next time she should look for professionals to do that job; this would contribute to the quality of her works and satisfy her fans.  My rating for this DVD cannot be more than 2 stars.",1408233600,7,1209,4.546296296296297
8353883,4,B002748SR4,Ana is a very fine guitarist and this CD proves it. I would very much like to present some of my music to her.  Hopefully she will give one of my guitar pieces a chance?  Jamie Palumbo  [...],1399766400,,191,3.973684210526316
8353884,5,B002748SR4,"I love this DVD! I have followed Ana's work for quite some time but have never had the pleasure of watching her on DVD until now. I missed her master class when she performed locally so I've always wanted to see her behind the scenes, so to speak. Her interview on the DVD reveals her as a warm, fascinating person who is obviously dedicated to the guitar. I was pleasantly surprised regarding the audio in this DVD which is extremely well done; her guitar is clear with great projection. Her selection of pieces to put on this DVD shows good taste as well as displaying her extensive talents. The sets are nicely arranged. This is just a good DVD to watch and listen to. I want more!",1396569600,,684,4.393700787401575
