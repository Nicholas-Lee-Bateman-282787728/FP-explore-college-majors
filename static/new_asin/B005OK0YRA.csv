Good Ray Nazzaro's work. Entertaining ... Nice pictures and good duplication. I've seen the movie in 1953, when I was a teen-ager !",1519948800,,283,4.68

8481342,3,B005OK0YRA,"The Bandits of Corsica, 1953 film

""The Corsican Brothers"" was a famous novel from the 19th century. This novel was adapted to a movie in 1941 with a big budget and major actors. Corsica is an island in the Mediterranean that is ruled by France and best known as the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte. This story takes place in the early 19th century during the monarchy. This is a sequel with a lower budget and actors who would become better known in the future. This story tells about the oppression of the people by an aristocratic government of big landowners, and the personal conflicts of some people. Will the evil government be thwarted so the good people will win? Yes, if the movie is to be a success.

The outdoor scenes remind me of the many western movies produced in the 1930s and early 1940s. This is like a western with swords instead of revolvers, and different costumes. The special effects are using an actor to play twin brothers (who had a special bond at birth but lead separate lives). [Note the sharp line that divides each side of the scenes with the twin brothers.] The classic westerns of the 1930s involved an attack on small ranchers or farmers by a big rancher who sought to take over their lands and property. Only by uniting together could they defeat the big rancher or landowner. This echoed the conflicts between local small businesses and their big corporate competitors. But most small businesses are now almost as obsolete ad the coal burning steam trains that provided most transportation then.",1352246400,3,1533,4.737827715355805
8481343,5,B005OK0YRA,"I am a very great fan of Lee Van Cleef. Eventhough he has a secondary role in this movie, his part is one of his more out-of-the-ordinary roles. He trades a six shooter for a sword and does magnificently with it. Not to mention that he is absolutely sexy in uniform.
If you really love LVC you will love this one.",1330214400,2,313,4.147540983606557
