7118525,5,B00W312S9A,Extremely well done film making to demonstrate the beauty of the sport and what makes it so appealing to those that pursue it.  It was done in a way that shows people who are not glider pilots how fun the sport can be.,1433376000,,218,4.069767441860465

7118534,5,B00W312S9A,"Excellent soaring video. The action of the gliders over the western U.S. Is spectacular. Being a glider pilot, I really appreciate the efforts that went into gaining the video. Not an easy task. Very well done.",1435708800,,210,4.861111111111111
7118535,3,B00W312S9A,"Loved the trailer for this movie... was disappointed that there wasn't more in the movie.  Don't get me wrong... I'm a flying buff and enjoyed the movie... but I don't think it did enough to pull  in non pilots and bring them into the sport.  Loved the Stemme, and the interviews... just trying to figure out what exactly could have been done to make this the dream movie I hoped it would be.  Can't put my finger on it.

Perhaps the Soaring community needs a film with similar great shots, but with kids at a Soaring camp, and go through Dick Wolters ""Art and Technique"" of soaring, to highlight tow instruction, boxing the wake, spin instruction, and just the thrill of learning to center in a thermal for the first time.  Hard bill of tasks to do.

I would otherwise give the movie 4 stars... but the excitement and energy from the trailer sort of ends within about 20 minutes of this movie.
Narriation, Interviews, and all the footage were exceptional!  A difficult picture to pull together.  Just fell a bit short.  Sorry :(.",1435708800,3,1030,4.548913043478261

8711899,4,B00W312S9A,"I liked it, but my wife fell asleep.  It's mostly just beautiful scenery of the west, taken from gliders.  As a glider pilot I would have liked it better if they showed a little more of the actual gliders, and the pilots.  DJK",1520985600,,226,4.209302325581396

8711904,5,B00W312S9A,"Having visited the Southwest America Soaring Museum, I purchased a copy of this film at the gift shop. I liked it so much I went on Amazon to get another copy for a friend I took to Moriarty for her first-ever soaring adventure!  It's a beautiful film, filled with quiet, breathtaking, panoramic visits that can only be fully appreciated by a flight in a sailplane!  A must see!",1468454400,,378,4.544117647058823
8711905,5,B00W312S9A,Absolutely amazing - - - beautiful and breath taking,1441324800,,52,4.888888888888889
8711906,5,B00W312S9A,"Great views of the West from angles you would never normally see, The gliders are great and the vistas from the cockpits are well worth the price",1438128000,,145,4.407407407407407
8711907,5,B00W312S9A,"This program is very well done.  We saw it originally on the local New Mexico PBS station which produced it and were ""blown away"" as they say.  I got my wife to watch it with me then, although she had no interest at all at first.  By the end of the program, she wanted to go soaring!  We purchased this so we could share this experience.

The extra content on the DVD consists simply of scenes of soaring set to music.  I found that to be nowhere near as interesting as the conversations and narrations of the main program.",1437091200,,523,4.232323232323233
8711908,5,B00W312S9A,Beautiful photography.  Good information for the non-flyer.  As a soaring pilot I knew of the project and was waiting to see it.  I'm telling all of my friends who aren't into soaring as a part of my campaign to grow the sport.  Highly recommended,1436745600,,247,4.545454545454546
