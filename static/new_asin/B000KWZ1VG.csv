2698807,5,B000KWZ1VG,Can't beat the Winx Club... they are super cool! We both love the dolls and the movies are a hit with her... I can only watch/listen for so long. She has all the available movies to the USA so far... I wish they make the dolls more available to USA as well.,1201392000,3,257,3.9615384615384617
2698808,5,B000KWZ1VG,"I loved that it got here so much sooner than they said it would. It is a great value for the price, there are double the episodes on the newer Winx Club DVD's starting with this one. Made my spoiled daughters 264 minutes, then she wanted something else ;P",1180483200,5,255,4.224489795918367
2698809,5,B000KWZ1VG,My daughter loves Winx Club and of course she has to have them when they come out on DVD. I really like this set because it has 12 episodes in it. Which is a lot better then the 5 or 6 per volume that season one had. Not only does it save me money but it keeps my daughter from asking all the time when the next volume is coming out. It's definatly worth the money you spend on it. I gotta say this is the one cartoon I don't mind watching with my daughter. I just hope they keep putting this many episodes in one volume. Since I buy all the Winx Club DVD here hopefully Amazon keeps selling them.......cause she's already asking about season 3.,1174262400,6,645,4.086614173228346
2698810,4,B000KWZ1VG,It's got some of the best story lines and episodes. It's full of adventure and romance. It's a cartoon that is well owrth the effort. It's how guys should treat they're girls too. Don't settle for anything less; Winx Club fans!,1174176000,8,227,4.560975609756097

8159445,1,B000KWZ1VG,"I bought this video because I'm learning Italian and the product description promised the option of watching in Italian with English subtitles. The video is actually English only. I'm deducting a star for misrepresenting the product.
Another star is dropped because the story is overly cute. I don't know how much of the story line comes from the original Italian production and how much is 4Kids ""improving"" the story, but after a certain level of ever too precious I can't survive any more. I only made it halfway through the first episode before I couldn't stand any more cute.
The third star is in honor of the voice acting, which is overly pretentious and self conscious. Not every slight remark has to be delivered with the enthusiasm of Vanna White presenting someone with a new car! I've heard that 4Kids is the worst version of the three, with RAI being better than Nickelodeon. After seeing this and watching the RAI version of the premier episode, I would have to agree.
And a fourth star falls to the animation, which is flat and lifeless. I could survive that if the story and acting were strong enough, but on top of the other flaws, it's unacceptable.
So one star. That's all, and it probably doesn't deserve that much.",1494460800,,1234,4.717592592592593
