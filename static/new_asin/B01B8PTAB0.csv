8749711,1,B01B8PTAB0,"Beware that this product is shipped from the country of Switzerland, witch means any DVD they send will only be able to be played on a European region (2) DVD Player and also cannot be played on a American TV that uses the format signal (NTSC) as it can only play under the Format (PAL) so I found out the only way I could watch it was to invest on a illegally sold online only region free DVD player with a (PAL to NTSC converter) with no guarantee it would work. And I refuse to do that just to watch the only DVD I just bought ""TomorrowLand Movie-This Was Tomorrow""! So don't wast your money on this product unless you live in Europe,",1478649600,,637,4.186991869918699
