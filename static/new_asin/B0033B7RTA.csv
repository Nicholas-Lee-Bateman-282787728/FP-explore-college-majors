8387904,5,B0033B7RTA,"I found ""Lalofit: The Freeze Technique, Volume 2"" to be quite enjoyable to do.  Don't let the term ""freeze technique"" throw you off.  Lalo Fuentes, the instructor and sole performer, offers a moderately paced and well structured program.  I did the exercises with some modifications and it is doable for the intermediate.  The editorial review mentioned that there are a high number of reps. I personally think that the number of reps are fine and appropriate, not too many, not too few.

The workout is about 54 minutes, which includes the warm up and the cool down.

The workout has five components to it.

Bodyweight exercises
Aerobic movements (including high impact)
Stretches/Poses
Exercises with light weights
Short breaks

This workout is structured differently from some other exercise programs.  For example, the stretches/poses are incorporated into the main workout.  The stretches/poses offer one the chance to slow down in between the more intense parts.

The workout presents an English or Spanish option, both with music only or with music and instruction.  Mr. Fuentes speaks pleasantly in English.  You can also do the complete workout to an audio commentary, with Mr. Fuentes and a female client.

Finally, there is a 15 minute bonus workout, to music only.  I found this workout enjoyable as well.  This includes the warm up and cool down, so the workout is very short and definitely doable.  The workout is a miniversion or an edited version of the main workout.",1318464000,,1483,5.06198347107438
8387905,4,B0033B7RTA,"This is a wonderfully unique, highly enjoyable and compact full-body workout. As an advanced exerciser and workout DVD enthusiast who finds this workout challenging, I would certainly rate the workout as advanced-level. That said, it could easily be modified to an intermediate level by using light or no weights, going less deeply into the moves, and doing the pushups off the knees.

The workout's structure is fairly conventional (cardio and strength training intervals), but the moves and execution are unique and yoga-like. Lalo's freeze technique, which consists of a pause and static hold in each move, builds intensity even in the more conventional moves by requiring balance and control and ensuring proper form. The workout is difficult and gets progressively more intense (the spider pushups are just the beginning...), but it still maintains a meditative, deliberate focus throughout.

One of the best features of this workout is that it is so compact, making it particularly suitable for travel: little space is needed, and hand weights are the only equipment (I use water bottles or jugs when traveling).

I use this primarily as a travel workout, because while it is a good all-purpose, total-body workout, it definitely does not replace more thorough resistance training (in particular for the chest and biceps- the shoulders are worked within an inch of their lives in this workout). Overall, though, I highly recommend it. Ignore the online reviews complaining that Lalo looks grungy- it's nice to see an instructor without a plastic smile who actually looks like he's working along with you. Advanced exercisers, this WILL challenge you, and intermediate exercisers, this will build your endurance and tone you up.
