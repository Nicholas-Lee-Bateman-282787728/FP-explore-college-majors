4960769,5,B0065IZCNQ,Upper bracket  British police series.  Waiting for more!  Difficulty in obtaining them in USA/Canada. We are still hoping for more in the near future.,1369958400,,150,5.166666666666667
4960770,1,B0065IZCNQ,"I have really enjoyed The Inspector Banks series of novels but have to say that I do not care for the characterizations of the main players in the TV adaptation. Am having real trouble liking the Inspector and Annie in the tv series, which is surprising since I find the characters in the novels quite appealing. The TV series seems almost deliberately making the main characters unnecessarily cranky, self-absorbed, difficult and moody. Perhaps it is the casting choices, or the directing but I was hoping for characters similar in temperment to those in the books. Awfully disappointing.  So, I think I'll stay with reading the books and skip the tv series. Alas.",1369094400,4,665,4.9375
4960771,5,B0065IZCNQ,"We had heard about this series- via a friend. You know two girls talking and discussing about murder mysteries, and the star from ""Baley Kiss Angel"" you know! The priest!??? I was told how good the series was and was not disapointed, and cannot wait for the next one to go on sale..
It has good actors in it, adventure and his amazing deductional skill's, if that is a word. My husband and I watched the 2 dvd's in about 2 days, so the first series was quick but worth it.
Thanks again, Sue & Steve Sanders.",1367020800,,507,4.237113402061856
4960772,5,B0065IZCNQ,"I rated this series five stars easily .  It's one of the toughest and grittiest crime dramas I've ever seen , it's very well written & performed.  This three part series follows DCI Allan Banks , a no nonsense detective & along with his assistant DS Annie Cabbot they press thru all the tangled clues & evidence to catch the killers before they strike again .  The last epesode hits close to home as Banks searches for his bosses daughter with an ending that will leave you speachless .  I would only recomend this series for adult viewers due to it's mature content.  An oustanding drama!",1363737600,,589,4.518867924528302
4960773,5,B0065IZCNQ,"Thank you PBS for raising the bar again, after introducing us to Sherlock, Wallander, Death in Paradise, Life on Mars...
I missed the first series though, and I am so unhappy not to be able to get the DVDs!
This is a deep and complex series, it might not catch your eye right away with some dashingly sexy Sherlock or a neurotic Wallander. It is an extremely well written police drama,in which the characters feel real, they have depth and souls.
This is no flashy CSI where gore and director gimmickry compensates for poor acting.
Banks is played by Stephen Tompkinson who is a tremendous actor, he creates a character that is haughty, fiercely intelligent, but profound and vulnerable in the end. He is such a pleasure to watch, there is nothing out of place about his performance, an intellectual professional ( yeah, sounds like a cruel joke nowadays!)that listens to Ella Fitzgerald, trying to make sense in a senseless world.
And yes he keeps his cool, and oooh... he is sexy!  There is really an unfathomable distance between him and Branagh's adorable wreck Wallander.
My first episode was, as I mentioned, series 2012, Dry Bones That Dream. Awesome! The script is soo tight! Great mystery, great characters, superb acting!
It was a delightful surprise to see Caroline Catz, I loved her in Doc Martin, and I love her DI Morton! Yes she is a woman, and she is just as fiercely intelligent as Banks! She is restrained in this, not the exuberant teacher that fights with Doc Martin! She makes a great pair with Tompkinson.
I have to mention also Jack Deam, great portrait of morally torn DC Blackstone!
The series looks sleek in shades of gray, modern.
I have not read the books, I sympathize with readers that find differences with what they expected. But for me this is as good as it gets for a police series!
BBC has american audiences wait for certain series, Death in Paradise comes to mind, also the excellent comedy Outnumbered .
Give us a chance BBC, we DO appreciate them!",1362355200,13,1986,4.69054441260745
4960774,5,B0065IZCNQ,I enjoyed both season 1 and 2 of the DCI Banks series. They are well acted with good story lines.  I would highly recommend both seasons to anyone who enjoys a good police drama.,1362355200,,178,4.235294117647059
4960775,3,B0065IZCNQ,"It's still ""OK"" but having read many of the books in this series, including some that have been televized, I was extremely dissapointed.
I mean, typically people would say ""the book was better"" for ANY given movie or TV series that is based on a book. But in this case, it is just way too extreme. Some of the books were changed so much that MAJOR parts of the plot are missing or changed and in some cases they even changed the end (i.e. ""who did it"")!

I would definitely recommend reading the books before you watch this. They are just masterpieces. After reading the book you can enjoy the ""visual version"" but keep in mind it's going to be very different.

As far as the characters, I was suprised to see that they cast people who look very much like I had envisioned the characters.",1362096000,,788,4.390410958904109
4960776,5,B0065IZCNQ,One of the best to come along in a long time.  I am an avid British crime drama fan.  The characters are well developed and the plot lines are sophisticated.,1360022400,10,157,4.2

8493447,5,B0065IZCNQ,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

8493450,5,B0065IZCNQ,Like other British mysteries DCII Banks is one of those shows that make you wish there were more to watch.  British mysteries are much different from American drama series in that the viewer doesn't figure out the ending within the first ten minutes.,1409616000,,250,4.813953488372093
8493451,5,B0065IZCNQ,"The Brits have a way of producing excellent TV series in a variety of genres.  If you enjoy this type of series  this will not disappoint.  I plan on getting series 2.  No point in rambling on about the acting plots etc  they are too subjective  surface it to say  if you LIKE George Gently, Foyles War, Blue Murder, Last Detective  you will enjoy this",1402099200,,352,4.3076923076923075
8493452,5,B0065IZCNQ,I love detective books and series especially those set in the UK. I particularly enjoyed this series due mainly to the wonderful acting of Stephen Tompkinson who seems to set the bar higher each time he does something. The support and guest actors are well cast and scripts are easy to follow and entertaining to watch. I am really looking forward to the next series.,1392076800,,367,4.661538461538462
8493453,5,B0065IZCNQ,"This contemporary crime drama is set in Yorkshire (Leeds is mentioned specifically in the final episode of season one).  A tough, tightly-wired detective chief inspector is paired with an ambitious detective sergeant.  Banks (played by Stephen Tompkinson) is a divorced, driven man with a chiseled face, tightly-fitted suits and veins about to pop at any moment.  His partner (played by Andrea Lowe) is a fetching blonde whose attractiveness is overshadowed by her desire for promotion.  Once they work together the rough edges are polished and they begin to work as a team.

The stories are gritty and sometimes bleak, though not quite as bleak as Wallander, but more intense than, say, George Gently, Dalziel and Pascoe or Morse.  While Morse sips scotch or beer and listens to opera, DCI Banks listens to classic jazz.

Based on the novels of Peter Robinson, which are nicely atmospheric, here the plots dominate and they are largely plausible and tight.  The central problem (at least with series 1) is that the characters lack warmth.  They are not unattractive, but neither do they draw our immediate affection and empathy.  The performances are good, within the constraints of the scripts, and the settings are evocative, particularly those on the vast Yorkshire moors.

This set includes the film Aftermath and three series stories.  This is not Foyle or Endeavour, but still quite strong, competent material.  I've just ordered series two.",1377820800,,1448,5.163090128755365
