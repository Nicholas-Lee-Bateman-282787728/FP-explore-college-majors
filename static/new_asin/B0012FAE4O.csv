8245767,5,B0012FAE4O,"This DVD is a classic military training film about the M-14 rifle, the successor to the WW2 Garand.  The civilian version of this rifle is called the M1A and differs from it's parent rifle only in the lack of full auto fire and the related parts necessary for that function.
If you are interested in classic military arms, or especially if you own an M1A this DVD is a great product to have available.  The gun is dismounted before your eyes, showing as well as explaining the functions of the parts and their relationship to each other.  Buy a new rifle, you get an instruction manual which often shows how to maintain the firearm.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a video to accompany that?  Well, if you have an M1A -- and I do -- here's that video.
The full auto parts can be ignored as the semi auto parts are still there and you can see how the gun is disassembled and re-assembled.
Also a classic piece of military history.
The M1A fires the venerable .308 round that outpowers the current 5.56mm. ""poodleshooter"" round our army's M-16 uses. The M14/M1A had a very short service life....late fifties to mid 1960s.  That's unfortunate since it is a top of the line battlerifle.",1373846400,,1179,4.511737089201878
8245768,5,B0012FAE4O,"I purchased this video to give Grandpa and Grandson (age 7) a chance to bond.  For anyone that has been in a ""Real Boot Camp"" training program, where it is instilled from day one just how important mastering your rifle is, will instantly recognize this style of film. So if you have a young child, and a Grandparent, that happens to be a retired Sargent Major, this film from when Grandpa was 18, will give everyone hours of family discussion time.

It was well worth the cost of the movie to provide the tools to have Grandpa and Grandson discuss the Cycle of Function of the M14 for hours.",1369872000,,591,4.412844036697248
