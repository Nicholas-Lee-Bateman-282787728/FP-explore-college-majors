1787044,5,B00006LPE0,"Me & my sisters used to watch this one when we were kids and LOVED it. Now that I have a daughter of my own, I searched for a copy on DVD and was thrilled to find it. Ever since she turned a year she's been mesmerized by this video. I showed it to her cousins (who are 4 & 6) and they are always asking me to play it. I don't mind throwing it in because it's one that I actually enjoy too. It's a very cute concept of traveling the world and seeing that even with differences we are all the same. Good music too.",1346198400,,512,3.794392523364486
1787045,5,B00006LPE0,"All the series Kidsongs, is the best for kids ever seen. To learn English, to learn singing, to have a nice time.
Better than TV Shows.",1342742400,,135,4.230769230769231
1787046,5,B00006LPE0,"My own children loved these when they were young & I think they are a great addition to my teaching tools. I discovered the children weren't familiar with many of the songs (London Bridges) so I used it as a teaching moment to teach them HOW to play London Bridges & they loved it!  We just replayed that song several times & the students had great fun not only going under the bridge & seeing if they would get caught (& a kiss from Mrs. C - me) but building the bridge with me!  This DVD especially was great to use during the Christmas Season as we went ""Around the World with Christmas"" so they got a little Social Studies lesson too!  I will be adding the other 13 original Kidsongs DVD to my classroom set.  A great addition to any parent/teacher's ""bag of tricks"".  They are not only fun to watch, but you can participate with your child during the songs too!",1325635200,,866,4.288343558282208
1787047,5,B00006LPE0,My grandma had this video from when she was a teacher for kindergarten and 1st grade. I was in my early teens and loved to watch it every time I went to her house. Now I am a mother and have been wanting to get it for my kids! I am so excited to get this! The kids go around the world to visit some of the children's heritage and traditions! The songs are great!!!,1304553600,,364,3.8666666666666667
1787048,5,B00006LPE0,"These DVD's are geared towards toddlers, but my 6 y.o. daughter absolutely loves them.  The songs are fun and she recognized some of the tunes.  It's one of those DVD's that I can turn off in the car, when we reach our destination, and she doesn't get too upset because it's not a story plot that she has to follow along.",1285804800,,321,4.245901639344262
1787049,5,B00006LPE0,"I remember these being on TV when I was a younger child, and I loved them! Now my daughter enjoys them as well! Kidsongs are fun for young children. Period.",1391385600,,156,4.233333333333333
1787050,4,B00006LPE0,"I bought this thinking it was the same as ""Baby Songs"" with Hap Palmer but it's not - my daughter (18 months) loves it though. It's fairly short and if you're looking for a plotline, this is not for you. If you are looking for alot of singing, you will not be disappointed. Good message too.",1384732800,,291,4.214285714285714

7972280,5,B00006LPE0,"I remember this video from when I was a child. Our little one loves music and seeing real images of children. This is such a sweet DVD. Yes, the footage may seem a bit dated, but there is nothing inappropriate to worry about when sharing this with your children. Innocent fun with great sing along tunes and entertaining footage. Love the simplicity of it!",1470528000,,356,4.578125
7972281,5,B00006LPE0,"I bought this for my baby because it was my favorite as a baby in the 80's. Well, I don't let me baby watch tv because it's not recommended but sometimes I need a chance to eat or do something so I put this on and she LOVES it. I think it's because she loves other children and this whole thing is made up of little children singing and dancing. The songs are great and Mr. World is a friendly face. If you don't stop it, it'll repeat forever. They don't make DVD's like that anymore because it's not recommended but it sure did come in handy when I had to clean up a huge kitchen leak once! Great DVD.",1465862400,2,602,4.025

7972284,1,B00006LPE0,This DVD was scratched and unplayable. I was not satisfied at all.... It would have cost more to send back than it was worth. I wasted my money and was lied to because the movie didn't play (I tried on multiple DVD players and computers),1423180800,,237,4.288888888888889
