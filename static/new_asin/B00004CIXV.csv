1339301,5,B00004CIXV,"Don't know what the reviewer below is talking about, this is most definitely a widescreen presentation. I have viewed this as letterboxed on a 4x3 screen and as a full 16x9 presentation on a 40"" lcd. Sounds like the reviewer has his dvd player or flat screen on the wrong setting.
Actually, either way it doesn't matter. Given the rarity of this title: the fact that it is rarely on tv and has never been released here in the U.S. all these years on vhs despite it's pedigree, I'd accept any legit version at this point.
  A smart, funny, unforgettable drama that entertains while it quietly builds to a powerful emotional ending that resonates long after the film is over. And it has the kind of ensemble acting that you just don't see in films all that much anymore. Every character is memorable and all the performances are dead-on perfect with special kudos to John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes who will make you laugh as they quietly break your heart.
  Sure the sexual mores of the planet have changed, but people haven't. And the film is ultimately about families and their relationships to one another, and in that regard the film is timeless.
  This edition has a soundtrack that has ""enhanced audio"" which according to my ears means the dialogue is up front, cleaner and clearer than any other version I've seen. The sometimes heavy British accents are now totally understandable. What it also does is put Paul McCartney's surprisingly appropriate and unforgettable score a little too much in the backround. Ah...you win some , you lose some.
  Still when all is said and done, an opportunity for one to finally have this great movie on dvd.",1240358400,22,1648,4.7177700348432055
1339302,3,B00004CIXV,"In response to the query of Dave From Central CT about the aspect ratio: it is correctly stated on Amazon.com's site as 1:33 and not the 1:66 aspect ratio of the British release.

First, I want to say that this is a better transfer than previous WHAM! USA releases--particularly the poor color timing of the Dirk Bogarde ""Doctor in the House"" series DVD releases. The sound and image of this transfer of ""The Family Way"" is very good, and much better than expected.

However, WHAM! USA has not done a good job transferring the original widescreen image to full screen. On my version of this DVD, the actors and sets are ""squeezed"" in the frame nearly like stick figures. Personally, I find this annoying, especially as there are decent full frame versions of the film on TV. At least the ""Doctor in the House"" films were originally filmed in 1:33 and this was not a problem.

The bottom line: a British working-class film classic has been given a decent if unremarkable release. If you are a fan of the film, buy it. However, it is not cropped very effectively from a 1:66 to a 1:33 aspect ratio, and it may become annoying to the viewer after a while into the film.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Way/dp/B001HQZJIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Way</a>",1236297600,7,1310,5.055555555555555
1339303,5,B00004CIXV,"I absolutely love this film, and am very excited that it's been released on DVD in the US.

But can anyone confirm that Amazon's technical spec is correct that it's full-screen (1.33)?  The DVD released in Great Britain is apparently 1.66, which would be much more likely than 1.33 for a film in the 1960s.

Cropping a 1.66 film to 1.33 doesn't damage it TOO much, but it would be a shame to be missing a portion of the picture on, perhaps, the only DVD edition we'll ever have available in the US.  Does anyone know for sure what screen ratio it's in?  Thanks.

UPDATE:  Great news!  After reading the two conflicting responses on the question as to if this DVD was widescreen, I went ahead and ordered it.  It IS indeed widescreen (enhanced for 16x9 televisions)with the correct aspect ratio of about 1.66:1.",1236038400,7,810,4.569444444444445
1339304,5,B00004CIXV,"The Boulting Brothers' ""The Family Way"" released in 1967 by Warner Bros. here in the U.S.A. was Hayley Mills' first film for the team, (she married one of the brothers).  It was the first of three films she made with her co-star, Hywel Bennett and also starred John Mills, Marjorie Rhodes, Avril Angers, Murray Head (the entire expertly picked cast) all in excellent, subtly stated performances.  The music was later applauded as the start of Paul McCartney's classical career.  The second film teaming the two stars and made for the Boulting Brothers, ""Twisted Nerve"" received a botched publicity campaign which nearly killed the film's being seen for many years.  (The third film teaming the two co-stars was the film version of Agatha Christie's ""Endless Night"" in 1972 for Sidney Gilliat).  Although in the Hitchcock vein (with a score by Bernard Herrmann), ""Twisted Nerve"" was also extremely original and imaginative and deserves to be released in all regions on DVD.  Both films strike notes as superlative entertainment in a day when imagination is needed in the film business, their being sixties' product actually a plus.  ""The Family Way"" can not be faulted as one feels as if one is a family member every moment and believes in the characters and doesn't want to see the film end. If the critical complaint of it being overlong is to be considered seriously (it had originally been a play by Bill Naughton, titled ""All in Good Time""), most viewings see the film stand as a classic and a trend-setter both in one and the stuff it so cherishes, life, finds fulfillment in the enactment.  Do not fail such a film by letting it pass without a look.",1235433600,11,1655,4.823321554770318
1339305,5,B00004CIXV,"Why did it take so long for this first rate film to show up on DVD? It concerns a just married young man who for reasons more psychological than physical cannot consummate his relationship with his new wife. What makes this film a standout is that it takes a subject which by its very nature could have been crass and buffonish, and treates it instead with warmth and sympathy. The peformances and credible and winning throughout, giving the feeling of real and complex human beings, not caricatures. Highly recommended.",1232668800,32,520,4.853932584269663
1339306,5,B00004CIXV,"Oh what a wonderful film!  This is Hayley Mills' first adult role and one of her finest performances!  A sensitive and beautiful story about a young married couple who encounter problems consulmating their marriage.  It was considered controversial when released, but is very mild compared to today's films.  This beautiful film is long overdue for a release in the U.S.  The whole cast is brilliant and the story is beautiful.  John Mills gives an outstanding performance.  The story will move you.  The acting is suburb, and the scenery is beautiful. Least yet to mention, a beautiful music score by Paul McCartney that adds the finsihing touches to make this outstanding in every sense!  This is a must for all of Hayley's fans, and if you are not a fan, you will when you see this film.  Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a series of Hayley's British films that are not released here to encourage studios to release more of her treasured British films.  It's time for those sleepy studios to wake up and realize that America still loves Hayley Mills.  It is certainly one of my top ten all time favorites, and it gets better each time I view it.  Surprise your eyes with this remarkable film! They don' make excellent films and have superior performances like this anymore.",1226620800,64,1284,4.755656108597285
1339307,5,B00004CIXV,"One of my very favorite Hayley Mills films, it also features a tour-de-force performance by her father, John, in the role of her father-in-law.

It's a film about love, romance, companionship, friendship, and sex -- all the components of a good marriage. Beautifully, wittily written, superbly acted, and with a score by Paul McCartney -- what more could one ask?",1212278400,6,363,5.05
1339308,5,B00004CIXV,"Jenny and Arthur (Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennet) are newlyweds, spending their honeymoon in his parents' home.  With a nosey family and paper-thin walls, the couple has no privacy and cannot consummate their marriage.  As time goes by, they discover, to their horror, that the whole town is gossiping about their delicate problem.

This comedy/drama is gentle and sweet and has sympathetic performances by all.  Mills leaves behind the perky child she played in her early films; here she's a sensible and mature bride and even shows off her bum. Bennet is memorable as the intense and miserable husband; but the real stars of the film are John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes who play Arthur's working-class parents.  They give remarkably compelling performances and bring real depth to the story, adding a painful subplot from their own newlywed days.  Their stoic characters aren't accustomed to talking about emotions, but their devotion to one another is never in doubt. The location filming in Manchester gives a gritty, honest feel to the film, and the busybody neighbors add good humor.  I heartily recommend this touching story with first-rate acting and a soundtrack by Paul McCartney.",1172707200,3,1188,5.15625
1339309,5,B00004CIXV,"Set in a lower class Engand town, where people are hard working and get bye each day with humour. The characters play their parts well with John Mills as the father-in-law of Haley Mills. Packed with lot's of laughs. This movie has the feel of a true to life story. Most people could relate to the family as it deals with everyday trials .",1097020800,7,339,4.3125

1339385,5,B00004CIXV,"This has to be my all-time favorite in my library of Classic Movies, it is a must see.  I fell in love with the United Kingdom while there and there is just such a caring and innocent lifestyle in this movie, it helps to remind me of things used to be.",1357257600,,252,3.9411764705882355
1339386,5,B00004CIXV,"My sister and I saw this movie once a long time ago on TV, and I have spent over 20 years trying to find it everywhere.  Leave it to Ammy to finally have it available.  It's funny that it was considered controversial by today's standards.  What is here is a charming and often heartbreaking story of a young couple, Jenny (Hayley Mills) and Arthur (Hywel Bennett) who have just gotten married but, after a travel agent rips them and several other people off, they are forced to stay with his parents and brother a lot longer than they'd planned.  Due to a lack of privacy, a lot of uncomfortable situations arise for them, particularly the inability to consummate their marriage.
""She doesn't sing anymore,"" Arthur's father observes (played immaculately by Hayley's father John) to his wife (Marjorie Rhodes).  You wouldn't either in that environment.  The walls of the house are paper thin and, try as they might, they just can't find their own place to live.  While Arthur is sexually frustrated and Jenny is being pursued a bit too friendly-like by his brother Geoffrey (Murray Head, who later went on to record the big dance hit ""One Night in Bangkok), the neighbors are beginning to talk.  This is supposed to be funny and, in a way it is, because I've never known people to be able to mind their own business for the most part.

Then we have both the couple's parents, Arthur's in particular.  Marjorie Rhodes is superb is the kindly, yet imbittered wife of a man who obviously longed to be with his friend Billy more than her.  While it's obvious she loves him, it is just as obvious to anyone (as Jenny's mother recognized) there was somethiing wrong there.  I don't want to give the ending away, so all I can say is that when things come to a head, I have to congratulate Arthur's boss's wife for giving him what for, the funniest part of the entire film, because he deserved it!

Handled sensitively and humorously, this movie is a British gem that doesn't belittle the characters, and you feel you can truly relate to them like they live next door to you.  Also, boasting a great musical score by Sir Paul McCartney and George Martin, the movie contains the right atmosphere to enhance the storyline and the actors' wonderful performances.  Full of mischief, heartache, and characters that are never dull or one-dimensional, this is a great movie for anyone who is interested in why people do the things they do in certain situations.  Highly recommended!",1330300800,7,2466,4.7
1339387,5,B00004CIXV,I remember seeing this a long time ago as a teenager and have always remembered it.

1339388,4,B00004CIXV,"Good Acting, and great shots of pretty English scenery throughout the movie. Plus Paul McCartney composes a great score on his debut as a classical composer.
It is definitely worth owning as a rare classic swinging 60's movie.",1297209600,2,226,4.973684210526316

1339390,5,B00004CIXV,"I remember seeing this film on late night TV in the late 70's and loved it-  Who could not love a film with Hayley Mills!

A true 60's film...the music by Paul McCartney is a treat, and the story line is quaint and I guess old-fashioned  to anyone who did not live through the 60's.

The moral attitudes are exactly as I remember them...a girl was a virgin until she got married, and birth control was whispered about.

This is a charming film that many who are not ardent fans of Hayley will not even know existed.  A very grown up Hayley (with a sort of nude scene) and the adorable Hywell Bennett who plays her shy husband. The supporting cast which includes John Mills (yes, Hayley's real-life Dad), Marjorie Rhodes and many other British actors who you will surely recognize when you see them (but whose names may not ring a bell)

Great transfer to DVD-I was pleasantly surprised with the quality after reading some of the prior reviews...I would have to say the quality of the picture is near excellent. Don't hesitate getting this!",1253318400,12,1039,4.553763440860215
1339391,5,B00004CIXV,"In 1966 Bill Naughton made a splash with his script for ""Alfie"", the story of a misogynist who disguises his intentions by acting like a dandy.  This lesser known film from Naughton, directed and produced by the Boulting brothers, also doesn't shy away from what was then controversial material.  Everything looks  perfect for the newlyweds in their picaresque Nothern England berg.  Underneath it all lies father-son tensions, impotence, and possible latent homosexuality.  Never fear, though.  At it's heart ""The Family Way"" is a light-hearted affair and in the end everything wraps up nicely and satisfactorily in a neat little bow.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Hayley Mills graduates with honors from children's films to adult roles.  Not to be overlooked is a deliciously gratuitous bum shot of Hayley.  The real standout to me in the film is Marjorie Rhodes as Hywel Bennett's no-nonsense mother.  A selling point of the film is the score by Paul McCartney.  It's nice and it doesn't intrude on the action.",1252022400,9,1018,5.1030303030303035
1339392,5,B00004CIXV,"more than 40 years old, and then set in the past in many ways, from my london life of the 60's the way that the characters develop is what is lacking in most modern films.  All the actors 'really mean it' to my mind, and the family tensions of newly married's living in such close proximity is something most of us we don't have to suffer from today.  The underplaying of the story of 'the friend' adds so much.  Father and real daughter John and Hayley Mills, what a joy to watch them all. Still fab watching after all these years.
