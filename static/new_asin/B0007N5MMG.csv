8049197,5,B0007N5MMG,"I am an Auburn graduate and remember when Pat Sullivan quarterbacked the Tigers and won the Heisman Trophy.  This game put him over the top for many voters.  The tape runs about 40 minutes with Phil Snow, the former announcer, and David Housel, a former Athletic Director, commenting on the highlighted plays of the game.  Great tape if you love Auburn or the Heisman.",1325808000,,368,4.71875
