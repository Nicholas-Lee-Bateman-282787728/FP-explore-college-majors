7108772,5,B00VTDQXQ2,"Great documentary. I have read a lot about Hemingway but don't recall anywhere near how close his friendship was with Cooper. Nor did I realize
what an intellectual Cooper was. I guess I was fooled by his screen persona into believing he was the ""aw shucks"" guy he often played. They really
complimented each other with their opposite personalities, Cooper, the gracious guy who wasn't spoiled by success and Hemingway the blowhard
who couldn't stand to acknowledge the role other writers like Sherwood Anderson played in his success and his jealousy of any writer that sold more
books than he.",1440288000,,594,4.95

7108779,5,B00VTDQXQ2,Outstanding....worth watching.  A few too many academicians and politicians but it would be hard to do a better job.,1435708800,4,116,5.105263157894737
7108780,5,B00VTDQXQ2,I watched Cooper and Hemingway with my family and everyone enjoyed it. It shed light on Gary Cooper and Ernest Hemingway on a more personal level and really allowed us to get to know them better as people and best friends. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to learn more about these icons of the 20th century.,1431043200,5,324,4.416666666666667
7108781,5,B00VTDQXQ2,"Great documentary.  I intended to watch the video to see if there was more to learn about Hemingway since I've been a life long fan of his literature and found him to be one of the 20th century's most interesting personalities. He's a true original. This video, however, took me in a different direction. The exploration of Cooper's life was fascinating. For the most part I was too young to enjoy his movies when they were first released and only ""connected"" to his role in The Fountainhead. My takeaway from this video is that Cooper was one of the great film actors of all time and was an original artist of his own making....in many ways the worthy companion of Hemingway. Watch it!",1476316800,4,686,4.5772357723577235
7108782,5,B00VTDQXQ2,Enjoyable documentary seeing the contrasts of 2 great men from 2 different artistic disciplines.,1475798400,,96,5.928571428571429

7108786,5,B00VTDQXQ2,An outstanding documentary that satisfies for fans of these two men or people who know nothing about either one.  As good a film about friendship as any.  It will also put to rest the over-simplified myths surrounding both men. Highly recommended.,1456531200,,247,5.0
7108787,5,B00VTDQXQ2,"As a Montanan, we are proud of a man such as Gary Cooper and to have his legend strengthened with one of the most significant writers in history is an interesting tale to tell.  Two of Ernest Hemingway's sons have called Montana for part of their lives.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the comparisons and contrasts this movie has to share.",1454976000,,334,4.55
7108788,4,B00VTDQXQ2,"EXCELLENT.  GARY COOPER WAS ACTUALLY VERY INTELLIGENT.  SO INTELLIGENT, HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY HUMBLE.... AND GET WHATEVER HE WANTED.  HE WAS, I SUSPECT, SUPREMELY HAPPY DOING WHAT HE DID.  HE LOVED THE LIMELIGHT.  HEMMINGWAY SAW COOPER AS A FORCE TO RECKON WITH.  HE COULDN'T BULLY COOP.... BECAUSE COOPER WASN'T IN AWE - HE WAS MORE FAMOUS THAN HEMMINGWAY.  IT'S AN INSIGHTFUL LOOK AT TWO VERY PUBLIC MEN, WHO WERE PROS AT TELLING A GOOD STORY, BEING GREAT CHARACTERS, AND ENTERTAINING EACH OTHER, AND THE PUBLIC.  THEY DIED WITHIN WEEKS OF EACH OTHER.
OH, ANOTHER FASCINATING TIDBIT: GARY COOPER ALMOST LEFT HIS WIFE OVER A TORID AFFAIR WITH PATRICIA NEAL.
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT FOOTAGE OF THE TWO MEN, AND A LOT OF GREAT ANECDOTAL STORIES... PROBABLY MOSTLY TRUE.",1449964800,,765,4.8307692307692305

Excellent documentary. Five stars.",1440806400,,128,5.095238095238095
8711187,2,B00VTDQXQ2,"I found that although the subject matter was very much in areas I am very interested in, I could not get involved with this documentary and ended up turning it off after a half hour or so.

Why?

The overdone ""effects"" in the visuals were not called for and distracting from the content - and the actors reading the parts were overdone.

I'm sure this is a very interesting story, but the presentation ruined it.  But in our digital age, we have lost the ability to tell a good story simply.",1528243200,,491,4.362637362637362

8711191,5,B00VTDQXQ2,"Many interesting photos, videos and stories which I had never seen or heard before. Love Cooper, love Hemingway. For Whom the Bell Tolls is always one of my favorite books. It's good to know there was such a wonderful friendship between these two guys.",1491782400,,252,4.75
8711192,3,B00VTDQXQ2,"The old photos and footage of this make it a worthwhile study. However, there is simply a lot of BS, especially about Cooper who I've always considered a weak-shouldered pretty boy, unconvincing and unable to act his way out of a wet paper bag. I liked everything about High Noon except him. Calling Cooper a conservative and Hemingway a liberal is nonsense. As for Cooper being a ""cowboy"" that's more hype -- his father was an attorney and state legislator who purchased a recreational ranch. He was NOT a rancher in the true sense. About Cooper being the ranch foreman that was more likely to give him a job since he really didn't have one. He rides a horse like the son of a lawyer and the womanizer he was.
As for Hemingway, I believe he was the greatest writer of his time and among the greatest of all time. His book I like the least is For Whom the Bell Tolls and it is fitting that he and Cooper were bonded by it. Sandy-haired Robert Jordan and his creator. Goodie gumdrops.
Most insulting to me is the near-constant conjecture by Waterston, another fraud. Half the time I was wishing he'd shut up.",1488499200,,1107,4.458128078817734
