8081550,2,B000B5IOO8,It's a lame knock off of a bunch of different anime that were popular in the mid to late 90's. And not a funny or good knockoff. I watched it once and put it away. Not even worth the time.,1375228800,,188,3.725
8081551,4,B000B5IOO8,box shows a little wear. There is no art inside the boxes. Every cd is in perfect condition and that's what counts.,1372636800,,115,4.2727272727272725
8081552,1,B000B5IOO8,"I think this is the worst Anime I've every watched.  I'm not really sure though, because I don't remember ANYthing that happened in the series, except the redundant, stereotypical, magical girl nude-ish clothes changing scenes.  All I remember is being bored out of my mind for the entire duration of the series, including combat scenes... I think there might have been combat scenes.  I imagine watching this show will give you a glimpse of what purgatory is like, so if you're interested in purgatory you should definitely watch this.  Every once in a while I think that I should watch it through again, you know, try to figure out what the show is about; it can't really be as bad as I remember; but that would be a stupid waste of another 11 hours of my life.",1336694400,4,763,4.547445255474453
8081553,1,B000B5IOO8,"At first look this series seems to have a great idea. Basically you have a young man who is the god slayer and a mysterious magical girl!! Sounds epic when you just read that, but unfourtunatly the voice acting is terrible, as is the directing. It is not funny although it does try to be and it does not do enough to really grow the characters. I can not beleive that I wasted moments of my life watching this show.",1236816000,9,415,4.2
8081554,5,B000B5IOO8,"edens bowy is an ok show, i rated it with five statrs becuase at the time i saw this i felt that it was very entertaining. the story line was ok and there are many diffrent charaters haveing there stories followed. it seems wierd at times. but it was an ok fantasy show. and i feel that it was worth watching. but i could do with out the incest.",1223769600,4,345,4.0144927536231885
