7130223,4,B00WBJSO3S,"Enigma comes on its own disc. So, it's not very compressed. It's no Blu Ray picture quality but it's fine - typical lower budget 35mm film and plus a 1940's movie feels more natural with film grain. There are plenty of extras making-of featurettes so it's hard to tell what's different from the much more expensive other version. The extras are grainy and lower res but it's unlikely you're going to watch those more than once - they're interesting and well done but nothing extraordinary.

The other two movies are on another disc.",1462838400,3,532,4.720430107526882
7130224,4,B00WBJSO3S,Tom Sellick does an excellent portrayal of Ike.  The movie shows how difficult it was to be the one who had all the decisions to make.  These movies show different aspects of the war.  Enjoyable movies.,1462320000,,202,4.555555555555555
7130225,5,B00WBJSO3S,This set of three movies is wonderful. Excellent value for the money. The best one is a movie about the real heroes of Telemark which is based on true story about courageous people who in my opinion the whole world should owe geatitude to as they stopped nazi germany from acquiring the atom bomb during 2nd world war.,1456531200,3,318,4.5

7130229,5,B00WBJSO3S,the films are based on real events and people they tell the difficult decisions that had to be done and most of the price ware personnel friendships and to be put aside for the greater good. Especially in IKE and Heroes of telemark  the decisions they made to bring an end to the war wasn't easy. So the cast did A great job in bringing it to the film.,1445731200,3,352,4.101449275362318

7130236,5,B00WBJSO3S,"Three great war movies for the price of one of them. Tom Selleck does an excellent job playing Dwight ""Ike"" Eisenhower in this good war drama. In Enigma we see the dramatic events surrounding Bletchley Park and the efforts to crack the Germans Enigma code. Good cast, acting, screenplay, action, sets, locations, and music. Heroes of Telemark is and older WWII movie with Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris. Plenty of action and well worth watching. I highly recommend this set.",1488672000,,475,4.95

8712835,5,B00WBJSO3S,"Ike is a great film of his struggles as Supreme Commander of the Allies to plan and initiate Operation Overlord on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Enigma is also a great film about the secret world of decoding intercepted German messages during WWII. The Heroes of Telemark is a fair film about a group of commandos trying to prevent the Nazis from developing the atomic bomb in a Norwegian laboratory.",1512432000,,391,4.681159420289855
