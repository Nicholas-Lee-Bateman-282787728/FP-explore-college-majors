Jeffrey Falcon's performance was mesmerizing, and he has an  incredible on-screen presence.  He makes everything he does look  effortless.  The other characters in the movie add  their own color to the  movie, making it one of the best things I've seen.  Ever.",920246400,,419,5.2272727272727275

Not only the King of Rock and Roll, but the King of civilization as we know it, and the King is dying. Guitar heroes from all over the remains of America set off across the bold new world landscape of America toward Vegas to claim the throne. The most promising is the hero of Six String Samurai. Buddy Holly with a Samurai sword, as proficient with the sword as he is with the guitar, he walks the west like Toshiro Mifune, dispatching cannibals, Russian Soldiers, and Death and his minions, all the while followed by a child sidekick.

1006358,5,6305297223,"I was not sure what to expect from this movie, but since I typically enjoy unique, quirky, fun movies I thought I would give it a try - and this movie did not disappoint! What surprised me the most was its excellent execution, which is not common in offbeat, low budget films. The story is reminiscent of a graphic novel and its over the top characters play their roles well. The lead hero as well as his kid companion seem perfectly cast, and it's obvious that the lead is an excellent martial artist. The fight scenes are really well executed - another surprise for a low budget film. The  cinematography is about as good as it gets with some amazing scenes standing out long after the movie is over. Finally, the music was perfectly paired with the movie and worked as well as any excellent soundtrack you have heard in a big budget film.

All in all I would call this a little movie that didn't know it was a little movie - and somehow managed to pull out the best aspects of a good big budget film (i.e. cinematography, music, action) but left behind the cookie-cutter characters and tired story line. I would highly recommend this for fans of off-the-beaten-trail movie gems! (and I just bought the soundtrack - also available on amazon).",1321315200,,1244,4.549107142857143

After I watched this film, I described it to a friend: a post apocalyptic rocka nd roll kung fu/cowboy movie with equal parts Mad Max and Wizard of Oz.  Oh yeah, and the lead character is supposed to be Buddy Holly.  How could you possibly screw this concept up?  Monkeys could perform this and it would be spectacular.

DO NOT buy this movie.  It's terrible.  The acting and pace make this movie virtually impossible to enjoy.  However, there is some very nice cinematography.",1305504000,2,525,4.6923076923076925

1006403,5,6305297223,"A clever picture. Recommended by Carl Rigney. This piece combines satire and action in a post apocalyptic world set in the USA after it was nuked and then mostly controlled by the Russians. The hero is dressed like Buddy Holly and looks like Buddy Holly and his name is Buddy, too. Word gets out that Elvis is dead and the new title for the king sends everyone rushing to . .. wait for it . .. Las Vegas. But the trek is dangerous and violent bands pursue Buddy but don't worry because not only does he have his old guitar but he also is bad ass with a katana. Along the way he picks up an irritating kid and spends most of the movie trying to dump him on other people, including a family of cannibals. This was a B movie meaning it was made for a fraction of the typical movie cost (2 million) and for that reason I'm rating this like a B movie. MY GRADE: A minus (B minus to B if you don't get B movies)",1278288000,2,905,4.033333333333333
1006404,5,6305297223,"What can I say about this film, it's fun. I love playing guitar and my brother loves the samuari and this just happens to have a bit of both. Filled with the upbeat rockabilly surf tunes of the Red Elvises, it's a neat and unique indie film that harkens back to the old days of Epic heros battling Evil Forces to save or destroy the world.

Here, it's old time surf-rock battling Heavy Metal. Interestingly enough, the soundtrack provided by Brian Tyler got me hooked on playing old-tyme surf riffs on my guitar meshed with the skull-cracking sound of Heavy Metal. A friend of my saw the film and immediately put it down, only because he was a die-hard Star Wars Fanatic *rolls eyes*. I don't care much for Star Wars, I was bored stiff watching the first films and never really went to see the new-age sequels as I prefer my movies with a little more gore and guts.

Anyway, this film is downright fun and I catch myself quoting the movie like I did in the title. I even snap my fingers when I have an idea much like Buddy, and plus I dig the guitar man. I've been looking high and low for a hollow body since that looks like that guitar. Even the show down with the Red Army is downright hilarious with the Red Elvis rendition of the Glen Miller classic ""The Song of the Volga Boatmen"". It was an amazing film with a lot heart in it and passion for the story something you won't find anywhere else. One of my favorite lines is right before the fight with the Red Army when the General shouts, "" I do not like Rock 'N' Roll music. It is too loud. I like soft music, dance music. Polka?""

The samurai responds, "" I don't do Polka, baby.""

Then the argument between the general and his soldiers, "" Why don't you shoot him?""
The general turns and says, "" Are you kidding, we haven't had bullets since '57.""

Again this is quite the fun film as it pokes fun at post-apocalyptic films with a charming fairy tale twist added on. Aside from my vast horror collection this one definitely deserves a spot as one my favorite indie films.",1252800000,3,2027,4.309711286089239
1006405,4,6305297223,"If you haven't seen Six-String Samurai yet, stop reading this review right now and rent it. Other reviewers have talked about this movie being over-hyped, but coming at this moving completely clean, I thought it was great fun. This is not a post-apocalyptic thriller. This is not a kung-fu flick. This is a kid's movie. I'd bet dollars to donuts that Six-String Samurai started out as someone's bedtime story. It's full of quest mythology (a la Star Wars) and childhood nightmares (a la Through the Looking Glass) with the magic of music to tie it all together (a la Blues Brothers). It's the Wizard of Oz with Mad Max sensibilities. Kudos to Mungia and Falcon for making this refreshing movie. If somebody gave these guys a major budget, a basket-full of cameos, and a little bit of script tweaking (does anyone know how to reach Neil Gaiman or William Goldman?) Six-String Samurai would be a classic.",1241395200,2,902,4.788461538461538

This has no redeeming values, will teach you absolutely nothing and has no real moral, either.  However, it is a fun and wonderful way to spend 90 minutes or so.  It moves from one crisis to another quickly, is full of action and has all kinds of one liners.

1006432,4,6305297223,"A post-apocalyptic, spaghetti western, rock-n-roll Samurai film? Yep. That pretty much sums up SIX-STRING SAMURAI. It's quirky. It's B-movie all the way. It's wonderful.

What we have here is a film shot on weekends on a minuscule budget in and around Death Valley, California. It also pays homage to many films; every Clint Eastwood spaghetti western ever made, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Night of the Living Dead and, of course, The Wizard of Oz, just to name a few.

The movie was dubbed giving it a hokey spaghetti western feel that matched the production values perfectly (very low). ""The Kid"" in the film (Justin McGuire) was a carbon-copy of the mangy little guy that follows Mel Gibson around in Beyond Thunderdome. There's a family of cannibals and ""The Windmillers"" who represent the slow brain functions from Night of the Living Dead. And then there are the multiple references to The Wizard of Oz (""Just follow the yellow brick road"").

The story's focus is on Buddy (Jeffrey Falcon), a six string carrying, Samurai sword wielding bad boy who wants to be the new ""King"" of ""Lost Vegas."" But first he has to get there. Traveling across the desert wasteland of the post-apocalyptic world, Buddy (who looks remarkably like Buddy Holly) has to slash, punch, and scratch his way toward The Emerald City (another Wizard of Oz reference that we see, Lost Vegas looking very much like the gateway to Oz's hometown). Along the way Buddy picks up ""The Kid"", a young boy who's mother was killed by humans resembling troglodytes. The Kid doesn't speak (initially) and only screams/moans whenever he wants Buddy's attention. But The Kid is good with mechanical objects (cars, motorcycles, bicycles) and the two form a grudging relationship as they travel together. The only issue between them is Buddy's priceless guitar which he nurtures more than The Kid ...in the beginning. But Buddy can play his six string as potently as he can don his sword, giving him a good shot at becoming the King of Lost Vegas.

On Buddy and The Kids' tail, however, is Death (represented as the four horseman of the apocalypse ...but without their horses). Death wants to be/remain the King and kills anyone who gets in his way, leaving a lot of rock-n-roll wannabes as corpses. And in front of Buddy and The Kid is the Russian Army (Oh! Did I forget to mention that the USSR took over the U.S. after it nuked us in 1957?)

After much bloodletting, Death and Buddy have their day on the sand. First comes a guitar duel (Death wields a wickedly good six string himself!), then the sword. But what will happen if Buddy wins? Can he be a true father-figure to The Kid? And what would happen to The Kid if Buddy died? Would Death take the little tike, too?

There are A LOT of well choreographed fight sequences (perhaps one or two too many). The camera work was done with an eye toward professionalism, never being herky-jerky or under -over exposed. The acting was okay. And the story was so ridiculous that suspending disbelief was quite fun. The dialogue often set the tone for the entire production, giving us some great bits like...

Death: ""You have failed me for the last...hey, nice shoes."" Then we watch Death kill the men wearing the shoes and walk away with new footwear.

The musical score is also pulled off well. The Red Elvises leant their music and themselves for the production (they are the ones with the nice shoes mentioned above). Their musical numbers reminded me very much of The Stray Cats (a band I liked).

If you don't mind low production standards but enjoy spoofs with a good, if somewhat ridiculous, script, then slip this little B-flick into your DVD player and bask in its foolishness. You won't be disappointed.",1153958400,16,3723,4.7686335403726705
1006433,5,6305297223,"When I first heard about this movie from a friend, I thought -- B-Movie/Cult Film. But this movie is so much more than a Cult Film and doesn't have the gore of a B-Movie.

1006435,3,6305297223,"And if Six-String Samurai had kept going the way it started, as a look at the emotional desert a lot of baby boomers feel like they grew up in, it would have been a better movie.

After a beginning that makes us care about the characters, the movie is a series of in-jokes, recalling movies like I Was a Teenage Caveman, E.T., The Road Warrior, American Graffiti, The Warriors, and The Wizard of Oz. The final triumph of the samurai and his protege is the defeat of heavy metal by pure rock and roll. (""Bow before heavy metal!"" Please.)

Buddy looks like his namesake from Lubbock, Texas, but sounds like Dirty Harry. Buddy has a '57 Gibson hollow-body guitar and a samurai sword. He uses both to kill and play his way across the desert to reach Vegas, the American promised land left untouched after the Russians A-bombed the US back in the fifties. (""The war's over,"" Buddy tells some Russian occupation troops. But it's hard for any generation to let go of its war.)

On his way to Vegas, Buddy comes upon the Kid (about ten years old) dressed in one-piece pajamas with feet, wearing a coonskin cap like Fess Parker wore as Davy Crockett on the Walt Disney TV show in 1954 (the first example of movie/toy-manufacturing ""synergy""). It looks like the Kid was ready to be tucked into bed when the big one dropped.

The Kid's mother is killed in the first scene. We never see his father.

The Kid is the kid we all were back in the duck and cover days.

Buddy tries to leave the Kid with a wholesome, smiling, all-American cannibal family, but, unlike a lot of boomers who feel like they were never rescued, the Kid is saved when Buddy comes back for him.

First it looked like Six-String Samurai was retelling the story of The Shootist, John Wayne's last movie with Ron Howard. Wayne is the gunfighter who's lived past his time and Howard is the boy who admires the gunslinger. In The Shootist, Howard grows from nave Opie, the son of Sheriff Taylor who never carried a gun, to grown-up killer, the rite (and right) of passage for every real American boy. In The Shootist Howard picks up Wayne's six-gun and finishes off the Duke's assassins. Then Howard throws away the gun, earning a nod and smile from Wayne before he dies. (But Howard is still a man now because he's killed.)

In a way, Buddy makes it to Vegas with the Kid. But I wanted the Kid to throw away the sword and pick up the guitar.

As another Buddy sang once, and as John Wayne said in The Searchers, ""That'll be the day.""",1118275200,7,2489,4.452747252747253

My friends shot me looks of horror after about 15 min of this crappola, then I was getting all the insults a bad movie choice deserves...but this time they were right!! One thing we all agreed on it had to go! It was boring,cheesy,cheaply done(and yes I know this is an indie movie)and just really not entertaing.

Mostly I heard that it was some kind of kung-fu movie that was trying to cash on the whole swing music revival of the mid-90s.  I must admit, that this would have been a very interesting movie, if not for one character.  The squealing wild boy.  At the start of the film, the six string samurai runs afoul of a feral kid who becomes his traveling companion through out the film.  Unfortunately, this kid communicates via a high pitched, loud grunting sound.  A very annoying high pitched loud grunting sound.  This kid is constantly on screen, more than the samurai, grunting ever louder and being annoying.  After a while, you realize that this character is not going to shut up, and is going to ruin the entire movie!
This film would have been a thousand times better if they had made that kid a mute.  Because this irritant kid's sound is heard at nausea through the run of the film, you will soon begin to hate this kid.

Six String Samurai's tale of Buddy and his quest to take Elvis's throne as the new King of Lost Vegas - the last cradle of American 'civilization' - has a few slow parts, but is generally pretty entertaining.  The fights are good (mercifully bereft of 'wire fu') and the idea is realized pretty well.  Russkie rockabilly group the Red Elvises do some of their best work in the soundtrack, and the guitar battle between rockabilly and heavy metal is a pretty cool symbolic showdown.

1006439,3,6305297223,"""Six-string Samurai"" is the type of film where you get the feeling that the title came first, then a plot was developed around it.  There are plenty of moments here, and some good ideas that are marred by an overall poor production and poor directorial talent.  Perhaps there is a little bit too much self-conscious concern on being cool and cultish.  Also, there is an annoying little kid.
When you have no budget, and no experience, you have to make up for it in style.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen here. The by-the-numbers directorial approach is what really hampers this flick, with a lack of any innovation or stunning creativity.  This is no ""El Mariachi"" or ""Evil Dead.""
The few saving graces of ""Six-string Samurai"" are a really cool soundtrack, quite necessary to a flick like this, and Jeffrey Falcon.  Falcon is an actual martial artist, and a veteran of Hong Kong martial arts cinema where he plays characters such as ""Caucasian Villain,"" ""Caucasian Killer"" and ""Caucasian Fighter.""  While not a stunning actor, he has the style necessary to carry a role like Buddy, and lends some authenticity to the fights.

We were both big Bill and Ted fans and when he told me the plot of the movie I was nothing less than stunned.  It sounded brilliant.  Russians takeover the US and ninja guitar players duke it out to see who will be king of Lost Vegas (sic).  I understand that some pseudo-intellectual film junkie would find this to be moronic, but for the majority of fun-loving filmgoers, this flick sounds brilliant.
  So, instead of being intelligent and renting it, I buy it.  Big mistake.  I pop in the DVD and I'm extremely excited.  The beginning is promising.  Fight scenes, rocking music, until the kid shows up.  Good lord, what moron over at the editorial staff of this movie allowed this kid to stay.  He screams interminably throughout the whole goddamn movie!  He made me want to jump through my television and wring his heinous little neck.  But that's not my only gripe.  How about the two lines of dialogue throughout the whole movie?  I felt like I was watching the Power Rangers.  ""You will now bow down to heavy metal?""  The movie would truly have been better with no talking at all.  Lastly, how about the last few fight scenes.  Buddy seems to have died at least three times at the end, and the little kid comes over and cries each time.  Magically, he's back to life, until the end when he is finally truly killed and that talent less little kid picks up his guitar and suddenly grows five feet while walking to Lost Vegas.

Buddy (Jeffrey Falcon) is awesome, the setting is beyond reproach, the premise is original, and the filming is second to none. The soundtrack is without equal. But despite everything it has going for it, this movie is dissatisfying, and the reason why can be summed up in a quote from one of Death's henchmen: ""The boy makes him very uncool."" If you substitute 'it' for 'him,' this quote is an apt summary of the movie.  You see, there's this boy in the movie, and he's terrible.  He's always crying, and being onscreen, and I want to shoot myself every time I think of him.  That's the only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5: the boy.

1006469,5,6305297223,"I consider a 'B Movie' to be a film that is not only made with a small budget, but also a film that has a lack of creativity and entertainment value as well.  'Six-String Samurai' has none of those problems with it.  It was a post-modern 'melting pot' idea that gave birth to it and only those who can understand and recognise the homages to the past can get the reason for the plot.  The basic idea is that there is no deep plot and it's just a mix of the filmakers favorite things captured on film in various genre's.  There is, however, the attempt to suggest that the only reason that Buddy Holly wasn't deemed the king of Rock and Roll was because he died before he could take over and what he was replaced with was a showboat who didn't know a thing about rock and roll because he was a popstar.  An attachment to this idea is the thought that not even today's axe grinders could match up to him and this is played out by the dueling guitars between 'Buddy' and 'Death' at the end.  There might be other ideas, but my review is getting long so I'll get technical.  The production design, lighting, and cinematography are very good considering the fact that their influences were primarily Westerns, Chop suey Kung Fu pictures, and 50's surf videos.  This bizarre mix of influences is also shown in the soundtrack as well which is a mix of tracks done by the Red Elvises and a score by Brian Tyler.  The Red Elvises changed their sound to a spaghetti/surf/dixieland/ feel that's in tune with the film's humor and Tyler's score is in tune with the ridiculous, yet plausible dramatic aspect of the film. If most people would listen to Tyler's score I believe that they would want to see the film it was composed for and upon seeing it, most would probably say that it was a waste of good film music.  As a closing thought I'd just like to say that the first time I saw the film I was amazed at the actual attempt to provide cinematography that had a personality to it and I also noticed the good quality of the action sequences because I've seen higher budgeted films have scenes that are choreographed  with less enthusiasm.  The energy and work put into this film is obvious, so I'd say that the film is above camp because that's not it's only selling point.  It can be viewed as a tribute to the best in all of their favorite genres, but compiled into one film to save time and money.",1020643200,3,2390,4.367945823927765

Six-String Samurai is nothing like this.  Jeffrey Falcon is not edgy, not funny, and not entertaining.  The coolest thing about this movie is the concept which is so poorly executed that it just about makes you want to take your own life.  Stumbling over itself in in a vain attempt to be cultish, this movie is so bad that not even the Red Elvis' film debut can save it.

It's a post nuklear world(low budged movie), but that's not

The plot is simple: travelling hero on a quest of sorts so's
he can be the new King of Rock, or should I say Vegas, meets a
young boy who he winds up rescuing/helping and vice versa.
There are many funny takes og famous American values that were
upheld in the 50's.  And to my liking it dismantles them well.

This movie takes the Mad Max apocalyptic world and shames it with style. Very few movies can boast this much style. With hardly any dialogue, this tale is spun with music and something that you can never quite put your finger on. It's not for everybody.

1006652,4,6305297223,"How can you not like a movie as wildly immaginative as Six-String Samurai?  To put it simply; this movie rocks!  A post-apocolyptic adventure that features echoes of everything from Kurosawa, Woo, and the Mad Max series to  Shane and The Wizard of Oz, Six-String Samurai takes all of these  elements(and several others) and melds them into a highly entertaining and  original concoction.  Jeffery Falcon turns in a fantastic performance as  Buddy, a samurai guitarist who is going to Lost Vegas to become the next  King.  His report with the orphaned child works quite well and is, in fact,  quite touching.  Death is hillariously portrayed as a heavy metal Slash  clone, complete with wigged-out flunkies who sound like they've been  sucking on a helium tank.  The cast of loonies that Buddy and the kid  encounter sends up any number of post-nuke pictures.  Psychotic bowlers,  gumball hurling barbarians and a Mexican midget are just a few members of  the film's rouge's gallery.  Contributing an excellent assortment of songs  is the Russian group The Red Elvises.  It works perfectly, warranting a few  extra dollars to purchase the soundtrack album.  This film is a blast from  start to finish.  See it.  You won't be disappointed!",961113600,5,1237,5.029850746268656
1006653,4,6305297223,"It would get 5 stars just for concept and beautiful execution, but the lack of decent dialog, and the fact that at many times the pace just draaaaaags, forbid it from getting the perfect rating.  You still need to  see it though.",954115200,3,229,4.428571428571429
1006654,4,6305297223,"A friend of mine saw this film during its limited theatrical release, and instantly recommended it to me. I saw it on VHS at his house, and my first impression was that this was a moderately enjoyable film, with a brilliant  premise. The cinematography was top notch, and the soundtrack is EXCELLENT.  It made the movie for me the first time. I liked it enough to buy both it  on DVD and the soundtrack so I could show this amazingly wacked out film.  After watching it several times, I fell in love completely. This movie is  simultaneously a rock and roll fairy tale, a samurai film, a Road Warrior  type film, and bracingly original. The Six String Samurai is fighting his  way towards Lost Vegas to become King, but must fight off bowlers, an  ENTIRE army of Russians, and Death (dressed like Slash from Guns and Roses)  to claim his crown, with only his sword, his six string, and an arsenal of  one-liners. Along the way he picks up an orphaned kid, who is admittedly  incredibly annoying for the first half of the movie, and learns the true  meaning of being a king. Add in references to the Wizard of Oz, and this  film is a masterpiece. You'll laugh, and you may even get misty-eyed by the  end. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something  different. You won't regret it. The DVD has one notable feature for true  fans of the film: some music videos from the Red Elvises (who provide a  majority of the soundtrack, and appear in the movie briefly), and who  simply rock. If nothing else, you'll have a movie that will either impress  or confuse your friends, both desirable results!",953424000,23,1610,4.547038327526132
1006655,2,6305297223,"I can allow for an incredible amount when it comes to movies, but it still didn't help me to enjoy this one.  I know that this film wasn't meant to be taken as high art, but I couldn't even stomach it as a parody.  The only  things I did like about it were the beautiful scenery, camera angles, and  some of the comedy.  Waaaaay too much slow mo - take all that out and its  running time wouldn't last 45 minutes, and seeing as how it only has about  5 minutes worth of story, you'd better heat up some popcorn.
I love films  of the nature that ""Six-String Samurai"" represents, and I can at  least admire the concept, but its execution was horrible.",952819200,4,649,4.211382113821138
1006656,4,6305297223,"*Warning* -- This movie has more cheese than the state of Wisconsin -- don't even bother if you're looking for a movie with even a touch of sobriety.

  Mutants, Cannibals, Rockers, Wannabes, and  Bowlers (to mention a few); this film has it all. Jeffery Falcon stars in  this painfully stylish movie as Buddy, the Six-String Samauri.
  The  <text color=""red"">Russians</text> dropped the bomb,  Elvis is dead, and Lost Vegas needs a new king. That's enough to drive any  movie, eh? Death is commonplace in this Mad Maxesque landscape. Not only  people meet with their demise, but the mythical figure himself (playing  heavy metal of course) appears often throughout the movie as a contender  for the title of King Of Rock 'n Roll.
  The brilliantly cast Jeffery  Falcon shines as Buddy for this movie's duration. He delivers his lines  with timing and flair that are perfectly suited to their appropriate cheese  level. His sword destroys all in it's path with the untouchable god-like  ability present in any Anime.
  The original soundtrack, mainly by the  Red Elvises, is impeccably fitting for the setting, Nevada. It is unlike  any movie soundtrack I have ever heard and that's incredibly refreshing.  The rockabilly/classic country mix (vith rusheen achsants) is both humorous  and appropriate.
  The only downside of this movie is the kid who  tags along with Buddy and always gets him into trouble. The kid himself is  not the problem, it's just that for the first half of the movie his only  lines are piercing yells, about 15 of em. Obviously this begins to grate at  the nerves a bit.
  Other than that, Six-string Samauri is a breath  of fresh air with beautiful cinematography to boot. Everyone (and their  moms) with even the slightest hint of a sense of humor should thoroughly  enjoy this post-apocalytic rockabilly thrill ride from hell.",952041600,9,1854,4.983552631578948
1006657,5,6305297223,"I was stunned when I saw this film.  I have long been a fan of the late Akira Kurosawa, the great Japanese film-maker, whose cinematic creations are among the greatest ever made.  Like Shakespeare, Sophocles, and  Aeschlus, Kurasawa managed to capture the soul of humanity in his various  works, revealing for his audiences the eternal and universal aspects of  that soul, aspects that trasncend the most ephemeral and transient of  cultural, temporal, and societal contexts.  To watch his films is to be  invited into the Dream-Time, the Collective Unconscious, to participate in  the Magick of the most powerful forces in the lives of all humanity, and  experience the beauty, wonder, and terror of those most primordial aspects  of our lives.  Kurosawa transcended his own cultural context and personal  history in his work, creating visions for the ages, open windows on the  most basic aspects of the human soul.  It was a shock -- a delightful one  -- to find that an American, Lance Mungia, has managed, in _Six-String  Samurai_, to do the same thing.  Without imitating anything by Kurosawa or  even his style in any way, Mungia and the cast of _Six-String Samurai_ have  opened for us the same sort of window on the Collective Unconscious  Kurosawa did for his audiences.  Further, they have done it in a strictly  American idiom, one that draws on archetypally American symbolism, myths,  legends, conjectures, and concerns.  Made on a garage-flick budget, this  beautiful film, which has a sound-track fit for the Gods Themselves, flies  far above the great bulk of films made in the last few years, however large  their budgets may have been.  I can't wait to see what Mungia and Palm  Productions will come up with next!",949708800,,1733,4.958041958041958

Yes, it's low budget.  Yes, the pacing is uneven in parts.  None of that matters.  Where the movie succeeds is in telling an over-the-top chop sockey action story with a rockabilly beat.

7887057,4,6305297223,"This has been in my Fandor queue for nearly a year.  Finally watched it with my sister last night and almost bailed in the first ten minutes.  Sis, a B-movie aficionado, bade me stay the course and I was rewarded with an original and fun cult classic in the making that recalls Mad Max, Buckaroo Banzai, The Wizard of Oz, Motorama and Straight to Hell in equal measure.  Granted, it's kind of a poor man's version of most of those films (well, not Motorama), but it has unique charms all its own.

It takes place in 2007, fifty years after the Russians conquered the US with a nuclear assault that has left the entire country a devastated wasteland.  The hero, a Buddy Holly lookalike, is travelling to ""Lost"" Vegas, the remaining free state, in hopes of replacing Elvis, its recently deceased King.  Producer/Writer/Star Jeffrey Falcon is far from the greatest actor on the planet, but he brings a certain charisma to the part and he has his samurai moves down pat from his past as an actor in 1980's Chinese martial arts flicks.

If Buddy is Dorothy, his Toto is an annoying, mute orphan who latches onto him on his trek to Vegas/Oz.  The two must fight their way past a murderous rockabilly band, a gang of Neanderthals, a family of cannibals and the entire Russian army, all the while being stalked by Death and his posse of heavy metal rockers who are intent on keeping him from getting the crown.  It looks pretty cheap and would certainly have benefited from a better editor to tighten things up, but otherwise it's well-directed with some really interesting visuals, plus the locations are absolutely amazing.  I couldn't help but wonder where they filmed this thing.  All in all, I think the filmmakers did well with a limited budget.

Just a lot of silly, stupid good fun for a certain brand of movie lover.  You know who you are.  All the Norman and Norma Normals out there...just keep walking.  Nothing to see here.",1474070400,,1927,4.626470588235295
