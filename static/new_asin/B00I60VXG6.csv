8639540,5,B00I60VXG6,"I am a big Joni fan, so I am hard pressed to see anything she does as less than stellar. She is a musical genius for our time, and whether you take in her whole body of work, or have your favorite parts, she has been a beacon to the music industry, and the public at large for decades.
Its not just the guitar tuning, or just the lyrics, or just the music; It is everything.",1422748800,2,374,3.9342105263157894
8639541,5,B00I60VXG6,"Joni is incomparable. Her creativity, depth, and artistic beauty in her music and life itself is timeless. She is not an ""era musician"".  Joni's music lives on for today's children and our children's children.",1400371200,,209,5.147058823529412
8639542,3,B00I60VXG6,"The story of Joni Mitchell is inspiring and moving, enhanced by her music.  the concert attached is analog even though it is sold on blu ray.  it id substandard audio and video.",1399507200,3,177,4.5
8639543,1,B00I60VXG6,"I was looking forward to this new Blu-ray by Joni Mitchell but it fell far short of audio standards I've come to expect with DTS MasterHD.  The audio was badly compressed and Joni's voice was barely audible.  Instead of taking advantage of the small venue's tight acoustics, this recording has added reverberation that badly muddies the mix and makes it all but unlistenable.

Also, this artsy effort is pretentious, a select group of hand-picked Hollywood industry types 3 rows deep on a back lot soundstage, exactly like no where else anybody sees live music, its not a real venue.  In the round, more than half in attendance only see her back.  Not cool.

Save your money, skip this one.  Its not up to Blu-ray standards and will disappoint Joni's fans.",1398643200,9,756,4.769230769230769
8639544,5,B00I60VXG6,"Finally on Bluray (SD only though), but with both specials on one disc. The DVD version of ""...Heart"" was well done-a Canadian Broadcast originally-the concert footage was done well for the PBS networks-Now to be able to view them both whenever;? Fantastic.",1396569600,5,257,5.142857142857143
