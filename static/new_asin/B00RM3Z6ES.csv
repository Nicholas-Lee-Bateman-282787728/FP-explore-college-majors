6932015,4,B00RM3Z6ES,"Movie came brand new just as described. However it should be taken note the Godzilla Vs Monthra film is the 1992 one, battle for earth, rather than the 1964 one. Besides that, the film was sealed and worked flawlessly. definitely will try to buy from this seller again",1467331200,4,268,4.604166666666667

8695544,3,B00RM3Z6ES,"It is a great buy for the price, however, the first two movies are the English dubbed version. The GMK movie is great and comes in Japanese Audio with English Subtitles, I really very much prefer the original version w/subtitles",1518566400,2,228,4.725

8695547,2,B00RM3Z6ES,"Despite the product description, the two Heisei-era films (Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah / Godzilla Vs. Mothra) are not/not in Japanese with English subs. These are the same English-dubbed, cropped 1.33:1 releases available elsewhere. As of August 2017, apparently these two films don't have a Japanese-language/widescreen DVD R1 release, only Blu-Ray. The Godzilla/Mothra/Ghidorah Giant Monsters All-Out Attack film evidently is in Japanese with English subs.",1502064000,2,457,6.15625

8695550,1,B00RM3Z6ES,"When ordering this DVD the description said that it was ""ALL REGIONS"", we ordered it and gave it as a present for Christmas and now the DVD will not play it says ""prohibited by area code"" and when we look on the case it does say Region 1.  We feel very disappointed that we were misled into buying this product, we live in the U.K. therefore we know that region 1 does not work and would not have purchased this item.",1484092800,,417,4.148148148148148
