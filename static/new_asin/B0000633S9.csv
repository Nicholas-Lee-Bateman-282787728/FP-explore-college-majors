7958620,5,B0000633S9,"Blue Gender just keeps getting better with ""Blue Gender, Volume # 3.""  Includes the episodes ""Sympath"", ""Oasis"", and ""Confirm"".  The episode Sympath is great, Yuji and Marlene come across a new character named Dice (Finally! I thought they were going to be alone forever), a roughneck loner who remains alive due to the fact that he has an armored shrike (a bad one at that, it's alright I guess). Anyways, he helps Yuji and Marlene out throughout the entire DVD.
In the episode Oasis, Yuji gets separated from Marlene and Dice, and is picked up by some nomads and ends up falling in love with a girl named Elena. This episode isn't without its action scenes though, Yuji protects the nomads from a group of bandits. Great episode.
Lastly, in Confirm, Yuji is finally reunited with Marlene and Dice, and is forced with a decision - Go with Marlene to Second Earth, or stay with his new love, Elena.  Decisions, decisions.
Overall this DVD is really more of a plot-evolver, but it's still a GREAT DVD which I highly recommend buying. The animation and dubs are better than ever. Anyone who thinks of this series as a poor one is obviously a moron, yes a moron. Buy it while you still can! It's Great! :) - Ryan ...",1031961600,7,1213,4.555045871559633
