8339407,2,B001S35ECM,"I've read two or three books about the SR-71 and YF-12 that describe their unique and innovative design and construction.  To me, like Seymour Cray's original supercomputers, the SR-71 reflects pure design and engineering genius.

I've seen an SR-71 flying low and _slow_, and I've heard the roar of its engines being tested on the desert flats.  These amazingly sleek and compact planes are as fast as they look.

Thus with this background, I watched the SR-71 segment but found the narration repetitive and uninformative.  There's dead air, dark images of the Blackbird in darkness, duplicate scenes, and no drama or insight.  Given that the SR-71 is a majestic and impressive feat of engineering, this DVD represents a lost opportunity and, unfortunately, a waste of time.",1246320000,10,775,5.111111111111111
