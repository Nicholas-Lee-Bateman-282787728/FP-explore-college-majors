6899149,5,B00R5JW83G,I think the biggest surprise is that it comes with an autographed picture of the original Kikaider!! That alone is pretty fan-worthy the remake has it's flaws and without giving too much away it's a good launching pad for any future endeavors. If anything it just makes this fan want to rewatch the classic series.,1458432000,2,314,4.7272727272727275

8694213,3,B00R5JW83G,"Reviewing the movie, not product.  Watched the original Kikaida show on TV as a kid.  This was pretty cheesy, sappy, and dragged on forever.  If you grew up watching these shows, check out the Zaborgar remake, which is a little spoofy of the old TV show, but hilarious!!",1505520000,,270,4.583333333333333

8694219,4,B00R5JW83G,"BOTTOM LINE: If you're not already of fan of the original 1972 KIKAIDA series (or its sequel KIKAIDA 01, from 1973), then you might be left wondering just what the heck is going on here. Still, the story isn't too hard to follow, plus there's decent emotional drama, some terrific action, energetically-staged fight scenes and a nice moral message. Pretty impressive for a one-off tokusatsu film. Even so, since there is a truckload of affectionate nods to the old shows, it's more rewarding if you're familiar with the noble yet tragic story of the blue & red android and his human-looking alter ego. This reboot of KIKAIDA wasn't perfect, but I liked it. 4 STARS

THE STORY: In the future, a rogue government organization begins building almost perfect human-like androids. But for what purpose? When famous scientist Doctor Komyoji goes missing, the android which he'd secretly constructed, named Jiro, is activated in order to protect the Doctor's family. Jiro is determined to locate his creator, safeguard Komyoji's daughter & young son, destroy his ruthless enemies... and also try to decipher the meaning of his own conflicted existence.

THOUGHTS: [but first some background]. I was exposed to the old KIKAIDA series during my college years in Hawaii, where a handful of episodes on VHS tapes were available for rent at a couple of tiny mom & pop video outlets, (in Japanese language only, no dubs). Although I was in my early 20's, I quickly fell in love with it, in spite of the F/X limitations of the era in which it was made. KIKAIDA has good drama, a boatload of action, genuine humor, more than a touch of pathos, and a huge heart. It is acknowledged as a bonafide classic of the genre, standing head & shoulders above most of the other similar shows from any period in Japan's overloaded TV superhero history. KIKAIDA took Hawaii by storm in the 1970's, becoming the #1 children's show for a time. It's pretty incredible that a subtitled show from Japan, airing on a small independent TV station, routinely trounced every English-language kids' show from the big three network affiliates! Even Sesame Street! Take THAT, Big Bird! KIKAIDA eventually made its way back onto the air in Hawaii as a limited pay-per-view engagement in the mid-1990's, to celebrate its 20 year anniversary in the Islands, where it once again smashed the ratings.

So... I didn't know quite what to expect when I read that they were doing a ""re-imagining"" of KIKAIDA. This reboot takes several of the iconic cues & characters from the original series (and its brother show, KIKAIDA 01) and brings them into the 21st century, modernizing them while still remaining faithful to the original core concepts. Some things are quite obvious, while others are sly and fairly obscure. (Half the fun for old school fans will be spotting all the Easter Eggs.) The re-design of Kikaida is faithful yet fresh, and while I didn't care for the pointy claw fingers of his right hand it was a minor gripe that I could live with. The rest of the story was interesting and fun to get into as it went along. The visual F/X are a mixed bag, with thankfully more hits than misses. The martial arts stuff as slick and well executed, with a high energy to them. I don't know if more adventures are planned this reboot of KIKAIDA, but if there are then I'm game. :-)

THE DVD: A minimal standard-def release from Kadokawa & JNP Productions, but since the majority of folks here are in it for the film and not the extras, that's probably not a big thing. Picture & sound are quite good, despite the limitations of the standard definition format in today's hi-def world. ***If you enjoy Japanese live-action hero stuff then I highly, highly recommend picking up the original KIKAIDA from JNP Productions. You can buy them direct or get 'em here on Amazon, new or used. They are a ton of fun, and contain a surprising amount of emotional human drama to go with all the jumping, punching and double-chopping. [KIKAIDA REBOOT = 4 STARS. KIKAIDA, the original series = 5 STARS]",1477353600,,4038,4.772532188841201
8694220,5,B00R5JW83G,"Having never seen the original Kikaider series, or even known of its existence before finding the reboot, I hesitated on seeing this movie at first. But, since the movie received favorable reviews, I decided to try it out. I am glad I did, for it was a fun watch that didn't alienate me for having never seen the original, and has now made me want to see the original too. If you are a fan of other Toei series, such as Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Metal Hero, but have never seen Kikaider, give the Kikaider reboot a watch nevertheless; you won't be disappointed.",1475625600,,566,4.451923076923077
