6201151,2,B00HRUQBFO,Just a collection of some matches as well as some quick promos that barely tell you anything about the factions. You can basically watch anything that's on this DVD already on the WWE Network.,1406160000,,192,4.676470588235294

6201155,5,B00HRUQBFO,"I actually got my copy, found at a local store in the end of April. Great DVD with many matches I haven't seen in years or are extras on blue ray versions. This store also had it on sale. Great value and great price. Looking forward to Great American Bash DVD",1400889600,,259,4.098039215686274
6201156,4,B00HRUQBFO,"I have been waiting for WWE to release a Factions DVD for a long time, maybe I set my standards to high. While there are have been a ton of factions in wrestling it's hard to put em all on 3 disks. The match selection was pretty good, except for 2 WCW War Games matches that have already been released earlier this year and a few other repeats. I just feel WWE has every companies library, sure they can find some more unreleased matches. Thought the description of the factions themselves fell a little short. It was basically a small 2 min intro with superstars talking about these groups, and most interviews were from previous releases. Was disappointed there was no Raven's flock/nest, Ministry, Corporate Ministry, original Legion of Doom, The Dudley Family, or even the New Blood and Millionaires Club.
It was cool to see some of the factions that have been forgotten. The matches themselves make this DVD set and the Dungeon of Doom promos (I'd buy a DVD with just Dungen of Doom vignettes)",1400889600,,998,4.6440677966101696
6201157,3,B00HRUQBFO,"Gang, group, stable...no matter what you call it, it's the same result when a group of individuals come together with a common enemy or cause in that they become what is known in wrestling as a faction as this DVD collection is a match anthology showcasing various factions throughout wrestling history from Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling, and World Wrestling Entertainment.  This was one of those collections that didn't have a host but featured a mini-profile on each faction with comments from various superstars including Billy Gunn, Michael Cole, Normal Smiley, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, C.M. Punk, Kofi Kingston, Chris Jericho, Harvey Whippleman, Road Dogg, J.B.L., Sean Waltman, Josh Mathews, Gene Okerland, Dean Ambrose, Brodus Clay, Dolph Ziggler, Paul Heyman, Cesaro, Arn Anderson, William Regal, Jerry Lawler, A.J.

Matches Include:
Corporate Royal Rumble: D-Generation X vs. The Corporation - This was a battle royal held under Royal Rumble rules between The Corporation & DX with the winner getting the #30 position in the actual Rumble match as this match featured such highlights as one man eliminating himself just to attack & punish a man he had a personal issue against, which member of one team ended up turning on his teammates, and the surprise final participant for one team only to be upstaged by the final participant for the other team.
""RAW"" Jan. '99
[Best Of RAW Vol. 2]

The Bobby Heenan Family (Bobby Heenan, King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd) vs. Big Machine, Super Machine, Captain Lou Albano - Both teams of wrestlers had stalemates throughout the contest due to their equal size with each team delivering big blows to each other with Bobby Heenan coming in & getting a few shots in whenever one of the Machines where down but tagged right out when he started to lose control while Albano only tagged in when he was finally able to get his hands on Heenan.  This was just an average match that was only about building up the confrontation between Heenan & Albano.
""The Big Event"" Aug. '86

Right To Censor vs. Too Cool & Rikishi - The Godfather recently joined R.T.C. & renamed himself ""Goodfather"" setting up this match with his former ""ladies"" coming out (one who would become a future Womens Champion) to ringside with Rikishi as this started out as a six way brawl only to have both teams trade momentum using either their power or speed with the ""Save The Hoes"" campaign getting involved as well.
SummerSlam '00

Elimination Match: Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy, Buddy Roberts, Jimmy Garvin) vs. Kerry Von Erich, David Von Erich, Kevin Von Erich, Iceman King Parsons - This wasn't your basic elimination rules match as there were two referees assigned, it was held under Texas Tornado rules with all eight men legal at the same time, and you could be eliminated via pinfall & submission & being thrown over the top rope.  All men started off brawling with a surprise elimination happening within the opening minute by one team only for that same strategy to be used against them as each the participants paired off against another member of the team making separate individual matches happening throughout the contest before more eliminations happened with the pace slowing down & becoming more of a wrestling match.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" May '83

Elimination Match: The Nexus vs. John Cena, Randy Orton, Sheamus, Chris Jericho, Edge - This was the main event of the 900th episode of RAW with the special twist being that WWE Champion Randy Orton was teaming with 4 of this challengers in the 6 Pack Challenge at the upcoming Night Of Champions PPV against his other challenger Wade Barrett & his group of Nexus in a match that showcased how one group acted like a team while the others were individuals from the first two eliminations of the match to another man not being such a loner that he tried to fight all on his own with the other team constantly taking advantage of their numbers advantage.
""RAW"" Aug. '10

Dangerous Alliance (Steve Austin & Bobby Eaton) vs. Sting & Marcus Bagwell - It should be noted that Marcus Bagwell was still in his rookie year showing no intimidation right off the bat & being able to stay one step ahead of the Alliance along with Sting doing the same thing while working over the arm before they were able to get their momentum back using their opponents momentum against them along with Dangerously making his presence known whenever possible during & after the match.
""World Championship Wrestling"" Jan. '92

Flag Match: Hart Foundation (Bret Hart, Owen Hart, British Bulldog) vs. Steve Austin, Dude Love, Undertaker - This started off with just Austin & Dude Love in a handicap match before Undertaker joined their team later on with the Harts being the heavy fan favorites with the match taking place in Canada as the match had a mix of wrestling & brawling between both teams with one man being the determining factor in the end.
""RAW"" July '97
[Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology; Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary]

War Games Match - Team nWo Wolfpack vs. Team nWo Hollywood vs. Team WCW: Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan, Stevie Ray, Bret Hart vs. Dallas Page, Warrior, Roddy Piper - While this War Games match was still contested with a roofed steel cage surrounding two rings, the rules were slightly different all the previous years in that there were three ""teams"" & you could also win the match by pinfall as well as submission with the person getting the fall challenging WCW Champion Goldberg at Halloween Havoc. This match told a bunch of various stories & had unique situations such as Bret & DDP starting off the match, what Stevie Ray's intentions were, Roddy Piper showing that it was truly ""every man for himself"", the interaction between Bret & his own teammates, and the Warrior/Hogan confrontation. This match resembled all the previous War Games matches in recent years where the violence took a backseat to pushing the storylines going forward.
WCW Fall Brawl '98
[nWo: The Revolution; War Games: WCW's Most Dangerous Matches]

The Brood vs. J.O.B. Squad - This was the PPV debut for both groups with the Squad taking the early advantage with each man using their advantage in either power or wrestling ability or high flying agility while The Brood singled out one opponent & kept him grounded individually with either strong clothesline & a DDT or through double & triple teaming before things eventually broke down with members of both teams attempting high risk moves with some paying off more than others.
""In Your House: Rock Bottom"" Dec. '98

Elimination Match - Million $ Team vs. Guts & Glory: Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, Heavenly Bodies vs. Lex Luger, Adam Bomb, Mabel, Smoking Gunns - A traditional Survivor Series elimination match with such highlights as Luger & Tatanka continuing their rivaly, Mabel in a battle of the super heavyweights against Bundy & Bigelow, and when one man was left fighting against the odds.
Survivor Series '94

Nation Of Domination (Owen Hart, Kama Mustafa, D-Lo Brown) vs. D-Generation X (Triple H & New Age Outlaws) - It should be noted that Chyna & X-Pac & Mark Henry were at ringside in the corner for their teams as DX took control with fast tags while the Nation used desperate & illegal tactics as both teams traded momentum with each team singling out one member of the other team to work them over with one team attempting to use an illegal tactic only for the other team to use it against them.
Over The Edge '98

Big Stevie Cool vs. Axl Rotten - Axl started off brawling & beating down Stevie while attempting to deal with Blue Meanie on the outside before Stevie resorted to desperate measures to gain the advantage back only to be given a receipt for those actions with the coming down to one man making a big mistake when he had the advantage in his favor.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Jan. '97

Gauntlet Match: The Corporation vs. Steve Austin - Austin was forced to face each wrestler of The Corporation (except The Rock) with the stipulation being that the match could only end with either Austin was defeated or when Austin defeated a member by pin or submission but this was pretty much Austin taking on each member one by one only for the other number to get involved to keep the match going & wear him down but this match turned out to be iconic for the lasting image of a face to face confrontation that's not only memorable to the feud with Austin & Mr. McMahon but the attitude era as well.
""RAW"" Feb. '99

Elimination Match: Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair) vs. Dudley Boyz (D-Von, Bubba Ray, Spike) - This was action from start to finish as expected in a team elimination match where both teams were able to apply their various signature moves at one time or another but this was all about establishing Evolution as the dominant faction for the future on RAW but it didn't come easy as one member was bleeding when it was over.
""RAW"" July '03
[Top 50 Finishing Moves]

The Oddities (Kurrgan & Golga) vs. Too Much - It should be noted that their original theme performed by Insane Clown Posse (who were at ringside for this match) was replaced by generic music as Too Much was busy mocking the Oddities to get a distraction & attempt to work them over with double teaming while the Oddities dominated with their power & size in a comedic fashion.
""Shotgun Saturday Night"" Oct. '98

Triple Threat (Shane Douglas & Bam Bam Bigelow) vs. Rob Van Dam & Sabu - This was a rare encounter in that both teams weren't fan favorites coming into the match along with having their managers in Fonzie & Francine in their corners which came into play early with Douglas not only coming into the match with his arm being less than 100% but also getting very annoyed with Fonzie's whistle as RVD used his educated feet & Sabu with his diverse wrestling style using high flying & grounded heavily focusing on Douglas' bad arm with various twisting & stretching while Bigelow used this superior power advantage from either executing power moves such as a powerbomb along with just being physical with headbutts & Douglas using his superior wrestling skills to focus on Sabu's previously injured neck in what was a great contest that saw a diversity of styles come together to tell a great story.
""ECW CyberSlam"" Feb. '98

Legacy vs. WWE Champion Triple H, Batista, Shane McMahon - This was a unique setup here in that Triple H defended the WWE Championship in a six man tag with Orton winning the championship if any member of Legacy scored the win. With Hunter & Batista & Shane all went directly after Orton right away to the point where Orton was beaten all the way backstage leaving Legacy alone to take a beating before Orton came back & attacked from behind giving Legacy control as they singled out Batista & eventually Shane as well working as a team to ground & isolate them from their partners before eventually all six men were involved in the match with Cody using a chair only for Triple H to react when one of his partners wanted to give a receipt knowing it would cost him the championship. This was a good six man tag match that not only showcased Legacy as a collective unit but also played into the story going into the match about Triple H's partners being out for themselves to hurt Orton regardless if it cost Triple H his WWE Championship.
Backlash '09
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Top 25 Rivalries In Wrestling History]

War Games Match - Hulkamaniacs vs. Dungeon of Doom: Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Lex Luger, Sting vs. Kamala, Zodiac, The Shark, Meng - The Hulkamaniacs came dressed for war in army camouflage & war paint with Hogan having the most to gain as he would be guaranteed 5 minutes with Dungeon Of Doom leader Kevin Sullivan afterwords as various moments throughout the match were Shark being stretched over both rings, members of the Dungeon attacking & trying to pull members of Hogan's team through the cage on the outside, the issues between Luger & Savage once again boiling over, Hogan coming in fighting fire with fire, and the almost comedic ending involving Zodiak. This was another War Games match that wasn't violent more than just being a brawl all over the place.
WCW Fall Brawl '95
[War Games: WCW's Most Dangerous Matches]

Straight Edge Society (C.M. Punk, Luke Gallows, Joey Mercury) vs. Big Show - Before I get started, old school wrestling fans will get a chuckle out of the Greg Valentine reference Matt Striker pointed out in regards to Punk's t-shirt. This was a 3 on 1 handicap match with the twist on the rules being that it was tornado tag rules so all the members of the S.E.S. were allowed in the ring at the same time. In a nutshell, this was a dominate performance by Big Show as he showed that his injured hand was healed and easily took care of Gallous & Mercury in the beginning before he reinjured his hand missing a chop on Punk & hitting the ringside steps. S.E.S. was able to work over Show for a small time but Show was able to still recover & dominate his way to a victory with possibly the biggest story being where Punk was with Serena when Gallous & Mercury were at the mercy of Show.
SummerSlam '10
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard) vs. Barry Windham, Lex Luger, Sting - The babyface team started off hot here singling out one member of the Horsemen working him over individually & as a team constantly staying one step ahead keeping a fresh man in the ring with frequent tags causing the Horsemen to resort to dirty tactics such as illegal moves & objects while taking advantage of the referee while working over a member in & outside of the ring in what was a fun non-stop match.
""NWA Main Event"" Apr. '88
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

(Blu-Ray) The Wyatt Family vs. Daniel Bryan - The numbers game caught up to Bryan very early as Rowan & Harper just beat Bryan down with power moves & brawl tactics such as tossing him up & around like a rag doll while Bray kept attacking him mentally with his taunts not just physically that got a response from the fans of ""That Was Creepy!"" but also verbally telling him ""We could have been friends!"" before Bryan was able to get some offense in with top rope maneuvers along with using the environment around him such as the ring ropes, announce table, and steel steps. This was a completely different handicap match than earlier before as it was more character driven but still an good performance from all men involved.
T.L.C. '13

(Blu-Ray) Spirit Squad vs. World Tag Team Champions Kane & Big Show - Kenny & Mikey were the legal participants while the rest of the Squad was on the outside has Kane & Show were completely dominate with their power resulting in the Squad getting involved on the outside leaving an opening for the legal members of the group of focus on a body part before taking advantage of a situation to make things seem even in their favor.
""RAW"" Apr. '06

(Blu-Ray) The Shield vs. Ryback, Kane & Daniel Bryan - This was the first T.L.C. match (but not the first ladder match) where you can win by pinfall & submission and you saw exactly how this match was going to go when all the teams started brawling on the floor the moment The Shield made their way to ringside. There were plenty of hard hits & falls as expected in this type of match like one man sandwiched in between a ladder with a chair striking it, a DDT on a chair, a double suplex onto a ladder, a powerbomb through a table, a double suplex from a table setup on the top turnbuckle & Kane's top rope clothesline from that same table that turned one of The Shield inside out, a spear through the barricade before being buried underneath everything in sight, Daniel Bryan doing a ""NO Lock"" to everyone in sight, a curb stomp onto an open chair, and a dangerous fall off a ladder through tables. This was definitely a highlight performance for everyone involved as Kane & Ryback were made to look like monsters, Daniel Bryan came off like a little pitbull who kept bringing the fight, and The Shield looked like a tight unit who kept using the strategy of trying to single out one person for double & triple teaming.
T.L.C. '12

I would have preferred this set in a format similar to ""Top 25 Rivalries"" where they selected what this set is titled at in the greatest factions in wrestling history & profiled them but they went with this format similar to the ones they did with their collection on tag teams leading issues such as various groups were either easily forgettable or had no important relevance in history (Spirit Squad, Dungeon Of Doom, Oddities, ect.) while others were neglected (WCW/ECW Alliance, Hot Stuff International from UWF, Devastation Inc. from WCCW, The Rat Pack for Mid-South, ECW's version of Dudley Boyz with Bubba & Devon & Big D.) along with some of the match selections were questionable as they're were better representations for the highlighted faction than the ones they selected (Straight Edge Society, The Brood, nWo, Dangerous Alliance) but one positive I can say is that there weren't many repeats from previous DVD sets on here & each of the quick 2-3 minute profiles on the faction were well done in showcasing the selected group. In the end, most of the matches were overall enjoyable so I would recommend this collection for those who are a fan of the subject at hand.",1398556800,9,18133,4.722819216182048
