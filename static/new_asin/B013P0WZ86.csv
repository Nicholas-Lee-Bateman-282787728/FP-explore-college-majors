7368391,5,B013P0WZ86,"This has to be the best genre piece I've seen in years. Everything works!

When I heard it was going too be PG-13 I was disappointed. But it did not hinder the enjoyment of the film for me at all. I'll admit I'm a gore hound and gore would have been a cherry on top. They managed to get in quite a few very cleverly toned down kills,and it was enough to satisfy me.

The production was amazing. The sets are perfection as was the acting and hilarious dialogue. It had a sweet side to it as well seeing as it deals with the relationship between a daughter and her deceased mother.

This is as of now my top Horror film of the year even though it's a straight up Horror\Comedy. The casting was also pitch perfect. (Taissa Farmiga) of AHS Coven fame was perfect as Max and in my opinion the stand outs were (Alia Shawkat) as Gertie and (Adam DeVine) as Kurt. Both are hilarious and have the best executed lines. This is a must buy,because I can see myself watching this many times over.

The end was great and please keep watching during the credits for bloopers, shown on demand as well.",1444348800,26,1085,4.278048780487805

I can't get over how good the writing was, just in terms of making whole, believable characters, great dialogue, and an overall heartwarming film. It looked like a joy to be a part of this movie, and it shows. I had a great time watching it. Highly recommended to fans of the genre",1527206400,,439,4.365853658536586

7368427,5,B013P0WZ86,"Amanda and her daughter Max are having a hard time financially. Amanda goes to audition after audition, but can't escape her past as a one time scream queen in the 1986 slasher Camp Bloodbath. On the way home, they get into a car accident, killing Amanda. Three years later, Max's friend Duncan convinces her to be a guest at a screening of Camp Bloodbath through bribery. She is overcome with emotion seeing her mother and stands to leave, but through a series of coincidences, the theater is set on fire. Max and her friends Duncan, Gertie, and Chris plus her former best friend Vicki escape through the movie screen to safety. Things seem a bit weird since they end up in a forest and they realize they are in the movie when the car with Tina and the other counselors pull up to ask for direction. How can they escape this slasher movie alive?

The Final Girls is a charming, meta slasher that has the characters trying to survive the slasher with their knowledge of the film and the genre's tropes. Camp Bloodbath is closely modeled after Friday the 13th Part II, so it feels familiar and nostalgic to the audience. The film cycles through over and over if they do nothing, so Max and her crew decide to participate in the story. Their initial plan is to stick to the sardonic final girl to survive, but their involvement causes the characters to panic and she dies in a fiery blaze. The group has to come up with a new plan and navigate the world that transports them to the past for flashbacks and text on the screen as physical form. Billy is this world's version of Jason Vorhees who gets revenge on camp counselors with a machete for tormenting and physically and emotionally scarring him.

The characters in the film are very flat and generally badly written. Tina is super chipper and flirtatious. Her whole reason for being is doing a striptease and being killed by Billy. Her innocent question asking why her boobs make him so mad is hilarious. Kurt is similarly oversexed, but with an undercurrent of mocking and insults for everyone around him. Nancy lives the longest and has the biggest transformation of any of the movie characters. Her initial purpose is to have sex with Kurt and die, but her interactions with the real people change her. At first, Max tries to steer Nancy away from sex with lies and peer pressure. The change takes place after they really talk and explain the entire situation. Nancy now has aspirations to go to college and realizes that she doesn't have to be what the script says she should.

At its core, the female friendships and relationships are in the forefront with focus on support and getting at underlying conflicts. Max is obviously upset about her mother's death and keeps people at arm's length. She becomes closer to Gertie, Nancy (as her own person, not just her mom), and even Vicki. Vicki confesses that she's been cruel because she was hurt when Max pushed her away after her mom died. Once they are honest with each other, their facades come down and they are on their way to fixing their friendship. Max forms a friendship with Nancy similar that the one with her mom and gets some extra time plus the opportunity to say goodbye. When she realizes there can only be one final girl, Nancy sacrifices herself in a dance for herself and Max, filled with love and fun despite the horror movie trappings. Her death is heartbreaking and it imbues Max with Final Girl power in addition to resolving some of her feelings about her mom.

The Final Girls is a refreshing movie that both critiques and elevates the tropes of the slasher genre. Virginity is only valued because of the outdated genre, not because any of the modern characters actually find significance in it. There are so many touches of feminism and progressive views that contrast well with the reactionary views within the outdated slasher. While this film does lose a little bit on the second viewing, it's still an enjoyable, fun, and emotional film that I would love to see a sequel to.",1521849600,,4009,4.642253521126761

7368448,4,B013P0WZ86,"First, this is not a simple parody of campy horror films, but an intelligent satire simultaneously pays homage to the classic slasher film genre. While it is marketed as a comedy, it is truly an example of the lated trend of genre-bending in horror films. The storyline has a strong emotional core with brilliant performances by Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman. Farmiga's portrayal of a girl trying to reconcile with her mother's death tugs at your heartstrings is an unexpected, yet welcoming surprise that will stay with you long after the film is over.

*Small spoiler alert*
I never thought I would tear up at a strip tease scene, which truly makes this film remarkable.",1509667200,2,675,4.869565217391305

7368451,5,B013P0WZ86,"i find this movie to be a revelation, a smart, funny riff on the slasher movie, and with a real understanding of carol clover's final girl trope.  it's just so heartfelt, and it goes to show what any slasher, even one without a self-important meta-ish plot, can be with engaging actors portraying smartly drawn characters. this movie really speaks to me, and it is steadily climbing my all-time favorites list. it makes me look at malin ackerman in a completely different light. it's really a shame this movie got no release, as it is just a delight from start to finish.

""final girl"" seems to have taken on two meanings: topically, the last female (usually) standing in a horror movie, typically a slasher, and, more deeply clover's understanding, that the last female standing demands that the male viewer identify with the female protagonist. i think the final girls understands this, and plays both ends of what the final girl is.

the final girls empowers women, providing delightful agency. the way the three female leads come together in the end is a thing of beauty; truly, they are more concerned with repairing their friendship than with wondering which boys like them. and beautifully, malin ackerman's character, nancy (hmm...) learns, through her daughter's counsel, that she is not defined by men or her relationships with them. i also think angela trimbur is brilliantly empowered as the the cliched sexpot, tina; she owns her character's desires (trimbur, interestingly plays the very entertaining harley david in rob zombie's halloween 2 who dresses up as rocky horror's frank n. furter: ""i'm a chick dressed as a dude who wants to be a chick."").

the final girls is a work of heartfelt beauty, funny and warm, while understanding and respectfully satirizing the the genre it represents.  powered by engaging actors, a tight script, and a cleverly executed motif, the final girls is truly a breath of fresh air, and deserving of high status. it is astonishing--and appalling--to me that this smart, wonderful movie never received a theatrical release.  it makes me feel.",1507248000,,2088,5.020231213872832

7368467,3,B013P0WZ86,"Final Girls had a fun premise, like Last Action Hero for 1980s slasher films. I felt it was executed fairly well, with some genuine heartfelt moments.

7368523,5,B013P0WZ86,"When I had first heard about this movie, the geek in me instantly kicked into gear pushing me to go buy it before it's quickly out of stock.  Well I got a copy of it on DVD and I instantly loved it.  But now that I have it on Blu-ray my enjoyment of this movie grew some further especially as watching this on Blu-ray actually made me feel like I too was in this movie's fictional slasher movie Blood Bath as well.

Anyway, the people behind this truly did their homework as they captured not only so many of your basic horror/slasher cliche's of the 80's but the undying spirit of both the art of a  slasher in addition with the undying spirit and sense of humor of the 80's.

For any of you casual slasher fans or even die hard slasher fans the ingredients are all here.  You get the gorgeous and hot yet dumb and ditzy girl, the rebellious bada** girl, the token black guy, the dopey jock with sex on his mind 24/7, the virginal girl forced to toughen up, her beautiful yet rude friend, her sweet and loyal friend, the nerd, the guy who's in love with the virginal girl, and the shy girl that wants to fit in and lose her virginity.

What I especially love about this movie is not only the irony of how the chief characters of whom entered  the fictional slasher movie, Blood Bath actually make for fitting slasher cliche's but also the ways that they assume their reluctant roles so perfectly.

This movie gives reference to any of your summer camp slashers for example Friday the 13th and definitely The Burning.  When you think about it when Max Cartwright meets and befriends her late mother's character in the movie, it even comes off as something of a Back to the Future.  I don't know if it was intentional or not but even though Pleasantville came out in the 90's their seems to be a bit of that movie sprinkled in for good measure.

Gore and unfortunately nudity both take a backseat in this movie though.  The throwing in of a bit of 80's music was a nice touch.  Bette Davis Eyes by Kim Carnes was the more notable song used in this movie.  I love that song!

The jokes involving 80's kids being unfamiliar with our times, the silly slasher character cliche jokes, all of the mockery of over the top camera zooms and pans and tracking shots, the flashback mockery, and the general naive side of the slasher movie victims, all made for some deliciously hilarious moments in the movie.  The mockery of the inevitable sequel was also funny.

Malin Akerman was as always radiantly beautiful, smokin' hot, lovable, and most of all her performances of both Max's mother Amanda and her slasher character Nancy were quite sensational.  I'm not yet familiar with the rest of the cast yet but they were all really good as well.

In the end, if you are a huge slasher fan like myself and also enjoy poking fun at b-movies, are highly familiar with the 80's and 80's horror movies, enjoy referential humor, own and/or have seen(in some fashion) just about every Friday the 13th movie, Nightmare on Elm Street movie, Halloween movie(and so on) a billion times or so then not only will you get every joke in this movie, but it will surely win you over as well as become a necessary part of your 80's horror/horror comedy collection.  If you love this movie then I would definitely also recommend Camp Slaughter.  10 stars out of 10!  A must see!",1487376000,,3345,4.456486042692939

I wholeheartedly disagree. ""The Final Girls"" is far funnier, wittier, and just plain better than both of those movies combined. On the same website, Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com stated it ""is never once scary."" At the risk of sounding snarky, it isn't meant to be scary.

She plays a 80's screen queen surrounded by all the cliches. The only difference is, the surrealist approach to this. The actors know or learns fast what is going on. and this isn't another Friday the 13th spin off. Great for Rob Zombie to remake, but I had enough of the same thing with a little spin..Don't get my wrong Rob Zombie is a good director but we just have too many Friday13's ..I suggest this to all my horror friends..that it worth seeing. Shaun of the Dead isn't the only horror comedy that works. I rate this as high as Shaun's comedy timing. The acting..I do feel these young actors are what kids are today..maybe when they sit on the log..they would be going into texting with-draw more! and really come to think about it.

7368587,3,B013P0WZ86,"Possible spoilers.  At first glance you might be expecting a traditional Hollywood slasher film or perhaps a comedic riff like Scream.  But theres more at work here, even though the premise is pretty hokey.  Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman) is an actress approaching middle age who is struggling to get work.  She is best known for a couple horror movies from the 1980s called Camp Bloodbath and a sequel.  She played Nancy, the cute girl who loses her virginity to a braggadocio (Adam Devine).

Amanda is raising her teenage daughter, Max (Taissa Farmiga) alone.  No mention of the father in the movie.  When a horrific accident leaves Max on her own, she becomes aloof and depressed.  Her best friend, Gerties (Alia Shawkat) step-brother Duncan (Thomas Middleditch) is organizing a special showing on the anniversary of Camp Bloodbath which has become a cult classic.  He wants Max to appear on a panel to discuss the film.  She reluctantly agrees.

During the showing, a fire starts in the theater and in an attempt to escape, Max, Duncan, Gertie and 2 other friends, Vicki (Nina Dobrev) and Chris (Alexander Ludwig) cut through the screen only to find themselves on the set of the Camp Bloodbath along with the actors, one of which is Maxs much younger mom.  While this idea isn't new  think Last Action Hero  director Todd Strauss-Schulson (A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas) gives the film an emotional tug to go along with the chuckles.

As far as scary stuff, forget it.  The Camp Bloodbath story is one that has been repeated numerous times.  As a teen, a shy boy is teased to the point where he has been disfigured by the camp counselors.  He retreats and later resurfaces with a hideous mask and about 100 more pounds of muscle and slaughters the counselors and more that follow.  Think of Jason in Friday the 13th and youll get the idea.  While the new arrivals, especially Duncan, seem at ease about their danger early on, after all they are not actually part of the movie, they get a surprise.

What makes the film different is the new relationship and courage Max finds in Nancy, the fictional girl played years earlier by her mother.  Both Farmiga and Akerman are excellent in their complicated roles and Devine is a hoot as the macho wannabe lothario.  While this is no masterpiece, it does provide a new wrinkle to an old idea and is pretty entertaining.",1480896000,,2374,4.734146341463415

7368593,5,B013P0WZ86,"This movies takes a spin to the typical slasher films. The acting is funny and fitting with the time.
Spoilers:
The movies starts off with the main protagonist Taissa Farmiga whom has been in American Horror Stories, and her mom played by Malin Akerman are in a car crash resulting to the death of Max  the main characters mother. Max mother played a character in a slasher film when she was younger, the town movie theater was having a showing of the updated version of the movie when Max friends invited her to see the movies to see her mom on last time on the big screen. The movie theater was full of people that night and some idiot brought alcohol and another  was smoking which lead to a fire inside the movie showing room. In an act of self preservation Max and her friends slash the movie screen trying to escape, leaving them stranded inside the actual movie. The characters are stuck to replay the movie events over and over till the movie hits the final credits but to no surprise they are not out when the movies ends. The movie takes  twist and actually sends them to the squeal where they all gather in a hospital.
The movie was fun to watch if you needed to kill an hour. I believe that they all died and where stuck in limbo which was a representation of the movie.

Did you thought that Arnold's LAST ACTION HERO could have been way way better?
Here is the great great idea packed movie of the year that you will be crazy about.
This is an art horror campy time machine I cannot describe enough true original film.

MAN people are talking about this movie and I had to watch it and was blown away by the visual editing, camera work, the idea of the screen play the quirck acting and beyond.

I enjoyed every minute of it and still want to watch again at least 5 times more later.

An actress for horror B movie dies in a car accident riding a car with the daughter and a few years later she participates in her anniversary screening and there is a fire in that theater and the audiences rip off the screen and jump inside the movie to the movie world.
The movie is packed with killer, the mother alive but the actually the mother but the charactor of her mother.

You got the idea?

The camera work is pure amazing this is not just a stupid B movie and you will be blown away by the sole camera crane shot.
You will fall in love with the camp area location with the floweres, woods, lake and sky and so on. They are so beautiful and sometimes I felt like is this really a B movie horror or a TOP A CLASS ART FILM?

Yes the acting is quirky all the way cheesy as oil make your stomach suffer.
But you know you aleady had that kind of feeling before the screening right?

There are beautiful moment between the daughter and the mother (younger version ) and you will love it so much.

The story is so deep and original that you just have to follow it with open mind.
don't get me wrong it all make sense and you will follow them all right.

But it's just different.
It's not the movie HOLLOWEEN.
It's different.
It has a lot of twist and you just have to accept.

But you will love and love and love.

And most of all even if you are watching it with dvd the visual quality is evenly good as bluray.

7368750,4,B013P0WZ86,"Disfigured mask-wearing killer bent on revenge? Check. Campy origin story? Check. Display of typical stereotypes? Check.

More comedy than horror, The Final Girls is part-tribute, part-spoof of it's subject. I'll give this one some credit because l've never seen a horror flick like it before. It's very hip these days to do throwback to good old '80s slasher-style horror, but this time we are presented with a twist rather than a formula. The audience is taken literally inside an '80s slasher film along with our cast of loveable misfits and stereotypes as they try to survive. The movie is incredibly self-aware and pokes fun of itself at every opportunity. The Final Girls knows what it is and is not afraid to have fun with it.

The movie wears its influences, or should I say influence  Friday the 13th  on its sleeve. On occasion it even feels like a Friday sequel, albeit probably not one of the better sequels. It even rips-off the Friday theme. The camp, the masked villain, the backstory, a child tormented by others for being different and the list goes on, it's all here.

Characters over-act, under-act, but this is horror  it is expected, even encouraged in such homage work. It comes with the territory. Taissa Farmiga (youngest sister of Bates Motel's Vera Fermiga) may be the film's lead actress, but Malin Akerman steals the show, delivering what is a surprisingly convincing performance. The Final Girls doesn't get everything right but the mother-daughter relation between the two actresses leads to some genuinely heartbreaking moments (the Bette Davis Eyes scene is at least). Adam Devine provides the comedic relief as Kurt, a stereotype so hellbent on being a stereotype it almost hurts.

The way the film is glued-up together and dances between comedy and horror doesn't always work, but it puts a fresh spin on a classic genre. The Final Girls is nothing groundbreaking, rooted in nostalgia and hardly essential. Yet it's an entertaining and creative piece of horror cinema. Funny minus the scary, lacks gore and threatening kills but for this type of project it makes perfect sense. There was also the previously mentioned surprising mother-daughter drama/relation that stirred up unexpected emotions, something a horror movie hasn't been able to do to me in quite some time. It's a mindless horror-comedy with a heart that deserves viewing. 4 stars.",1470009600,,2379,5.053571428571429

The writer took a clever if not entirely new sci-fi event and pushed it out to an emotional story that really works!  The director found the perfect balance of comedy and pathos and horror.  The film is very self-conscious which adds another level of fun.  Malin Akerman is the talent anchor but Taissa is also perfectly cast.  You can tell that the cast knows they're working on something good, they're 110% into it.  Every time I watch it, I find new stuff I didn't see before.

7368894,4,B013P0WZ86,"All in all it's a pretty humorous parody of 80s slasher flicks; Friday the 13th being the main victim. If you're a fan of the Scream movies you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's kind of like the millennial-era Scream, where 90's babies have to figure out how to not get killed in a Camp Crystal Lake-like setting. And it's got all the usual suspects of a horror movie: the virgin, the mean girl, the jock, the jaded girl, and the nerd/horror geek (again think Scream/think Randy). If blood and guts and gore, gore, gore is your kind of thing this probably isn't your movie. It's no where near as bloody and gory as Scream (I mean c'mon: the opening scene to the first movie with Drew Barrymore, Jesus Christ!). But there are some really good laughs! And if you're one of those people who enjoys watching old school horror movies just to criticize and make fun of how ridiculous they are, then this is definitely for you!

Just be warned that despite all the parody, things do get serious at times. And there's one scene that might really hit you hard.

Enjoy.",1465171200,,1060,4.515625

7369004,4,B013P0WZ86,"Max is the recently-orphaned daughter of Amanda Cartwright, an actress whose most famous roles were in low-budget 1980s horror films. Max is having a hard time at school too. She agrees to go to a screening of her mom's most famous film, ""Camp Bloodbath,"" when the nerd organizing it promises to help her with her studies. Some friends come along as moral support. A fire breaks out in the theater, blocking the exits. Max realizes there's an exit behind the screen, so she and her friends slice their way through the screen (one of the patrons came dressed as the movie's killer and conveniently dropped his machete in the confusion). Instead of making it to safety, they wind up inside the film! They have to work with the characters in the movie to survive the killer's attacks. Too bad those ditzy camp counselors are more interested in sex than anything else. At least Max has one last chance to talk with her mom, or at least the character she played. Max and her mom's character are both virgins, so they have a good chance of making it to the end and defeating the bad guy, if Max can keep her mom from following the plot.

The movie is surprisingly good. The first scene establishes the relationship between Max and her mom really well and makes them sympathetic characters and three-dimensional people. They give the film an anchor that keeps it from drifting off into mere silliness or excessive gore. Actually, the gore is surprisingly minimal--the filmmakers opt for style (there's a funny and impressive slow motion chase sequence) over splatter (one character falls head first into a bear trap but viewers don't see anything). The movie is creative in a good way.

While the box says this is a loving send-up of '80s slasher films, it actually has a bit more substance than that description implies. It reminded me a lot of Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, another surprisingly well-crafted horror comedy (though I don't think this is as good as Tucker and Dale vs. Evil).",1461456000,,1980,4.719653179190751

And the general ending was rather cloying, though the characters finding themselves in the sequel was a nice twist.  As for the actors and roles, the Chris character was lame and for a movie spoofing movie formulas the Nina Dobrev character was the stereotypical, shallow mean girl.

Max arrives at a tribute screening for her mother's famous movie Camp Bloodbath with a few friends in honor of Amanda's death. However, as Max and her friends watch the movie, they suddenly get sucked into the movie and are now stuck in there. Max and her friends must find a way to survive from the movie's serial killer and escape the movie. The Final Girls is a movie that I have so much respect for. The movie pays a huge homage to the slashers of the 80s by including references to movies such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The movie also has some solid humorous moments in the film. At first I thought it was going to feel forced but the humor worked. Is it a perfect movie? No, I do have one serious complaint about the film. For some reason the movie ended up being PG-13, which meant that the violence and nudity had to be toned down. Considering that the film pays homage to 80s slasher films, those films contained violence and nudity. There were moments when the PG-13 rating was being pushed to the limit but also moments where you can tell they were holding back and it didn't make those scenes as effective as it could have been if it was R rated. Other than that, the movie is very well done as a horror comedy and if you are a fan of horror films, absolutely see this film!",1455494400,,1437,4.385767790262173

Though I haven't watched any of the teen slasher movies (such as Friday the 13th) that this movie skewers, I really enjoyed it. After all, don't we all know the basic plot & cliches of these movies. This movie was well done and well acted. This movie was well thought out and well written unlike most of the lame comedy/satire movies being made these days. The plot uses the device of the actors entering the actual movie AND adds a strong emotional aspect as one of the women who enters the movie is the daughter of one of the actors in the movie. She lost her mother in an accident and has to deal with the emotions of seeing her mother again.

One criticism is the early loss of the movie nerd who knew everything about the movie. His character could have added a lot to the movie (in regards to the satire), but he isn't used much. He has one of the best lines/scenes in the movie.

Overall, I recommend this movie to horror buffs and movie fans in general.",1454371200,,1018,4.269430051813472

The CGI effects aren't great, but in some cases that works to movie's benefit and some fun visuals. Good, humor, mostly likable characters and one or two surprisingly touching moments makes this a fun watch for fans of midnight movies, B-flicks and 1980's schlockfests.

7369146,4,B013P0WZ86,"Some will say that parody is the wrong word to use when describing this movie. No, its not a dead on parody like the films of Mel Brooks but the movie in the movie is definitely making fun of slasher films of the 80s while giving them a quick wink. Best of all it works on so many levels.

Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is a young girl still dealing with the death of her mother, actress Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), an actress known mostly for her most famous role as a scream queen in a well-loved slasher film from the 80s called CAMP BLOODBATH. A few years have passed and Duncan, the brother of Max best friend Gertie, presses Max to come to a midnight screening of the film being shown nearby. The place is packed with hardcore fans but as the movie plays something strange happens. The next thing you know a fire breaks out, Max and friends head to the stage to try and escape and suddenly their entire world changes.

Max and friends awake to find themselves in the woods walking along a road. Still unaware of where they are, a van approaches filled with camp counselors. They ask for directions and as they pull away Duncan realizes what has happened. Somehow theyve been thrown into a different dimension and are now living in the world of the movie CAMP BLOOD. They cant escape and find themselves stuck in a loop of sorts as the same van with the same counselors pulls up over and over again until they finally get inside and go with them.

Things get especially weird for Max as the moment comes when the character her mother plays wakes in the back of the van and Max gets the chance to see her mother in the flesh once again. Its a touching moment but odd at the same time since we know this is a film. But is it? With Max and her friends in the mix several things begin to change in what happens in the film. The so called camp stud continues to hit on all the girls, the camp nympho still wants to hit on the guys and Max moms character still is considering sleeping with the stud. But because of the rules of all slasher films should she do so her demise is guaranteed and Max will do anything to keep that from happening.

As the night goes on the attack by the films slasher, Billy Murphy, continue to happen where they are scheduled to. But when he is prevented from following through in one case another opens and things that should be happening arent. Instead new killings take their place. But this is a movie, right? Things cant go wrong or you can prevent things from happening, correct? Apparently not without consequences.

Once things begin rolling the counselors realize that this group knows more than they thought. They band together now, both groups, and hope to put a stop to the murders. For Max and her friends its not just about preventing Billy from slicing and dicing everyone, its about trying to find a way back to the real world as well while at the same time Max is trying not to lose her mother all over again.

This movie works on so many levels. Not only does it work as a horror film but the whole comedy based within works too. I haven't had this much fun with a horror film since watching DALE AND TUCKER VERSUS EVIL and that was a film I watched numerous times. Odds are pretty good that will happen with this one as well.

Everything looks great in this movie and the script is filled with in jokes for die-hard fans, enough mystery to keep you guessing and enough emotions to tug at your heartstrings when called upon. The performances are much better than usually found in movies like this with standout performances by Farmiga as well as Adam Devine as the oh so cool camp stud. His lines alone will have you laughing through much of the movie.

Some movies you watch because you want to get something from them. Others you watch for social redeeming value. Some because they are award winning films. This movie you watch for one reason  to have fun. The fact it that this and a bowl of fresh popcorn are all you need for a great night at the movies.

7369197,3,B013P0WZ86,"A fun, tongue-in-cheek romp through a horror movie.

The premise is this: a young woman, on the anniversary of her actress mother's death, is sucked into the slasher flick that defined her mother's career. A few of her friends end up taking this trip too. The movie is played largely for laughs, but has some good old fashioned slasher moments and a surprising amount of heart.

The closest comparison I could make is to Cabin in the Woods. While they're different films, this one has the same self-aware mindset and uses it to great effect. In fact, for my tastes, this is the superior film by a good margin.

However, it's not perfect. Specifically, there are some CGI special effects that really detract from the movie for me. They're simply bad and painfully obvious and I hate films that rely on it. Worse, though, and the reason it really bothers me: it doesn't fit the theme of the film! This is supposed to be an homage to slasher flicks of the 70s and 80s. Those movies didn't use CGI. They used practical effects. And if this movie used super cheesy practical effects, even if they were completely noticeable, I'd be all for it. It would actually enhance the movie. Instead, we get CGI which has no place here and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Boo, movie! Boo!

Still, I think the good outweighs the bad and you might be more forgiving than I am. If you're a fan of the horror genre, especially the films of old, I think you can find something to like here.",1451433600,3,1471,4.4572490706319705

7369212,5,B013P0WZ86,"Final Girls is a nice low budget film, it doesn't have any big name actors in it, the only one I recognised was the guy who played the Nanny in a couple of episodes of Modern Family (Adam Devine).  All the actors, especially the leads Taissa Farmiga, who plays Max, the daughter of one of the stars of Camp Bloodbath, an 80's cult classic slasher horror flick, and the actress who play her mother and a younger version of her as a character in the Bloodbath movie (Malin Akerman) do a good job.  Although you could complain the film could have been more violent and gory, and perhaps even have lots of nudity and sex scenes in line with the Friday the 13th franchise films, the movie still works as it is.  It is a teen audience aimed at movie and lets face it, parents these days treat their kids as if they are ten years younger than they actually are, back in our day even before we were teens, as kids we all watched the Friday the 13th sequels and recreated the movies as they were released in the pine forest at our primary school at lunch time.  This isn't a fault of the movie studios, they're just making stuff to fit that market that buys/rents their movies, our parents would rent R and M 15+ films for us to watch, a lot of parents these days won't, and even complain movies like Frozen or something are too violent.  It's just a sad state of the times we're in.  You can't blame the makers of Final Girls for trying to get that PG rating.

This is an enjoyable movie though, it's a lot of fun, reminds me of the freshness that Scream brought to the old slasher flick genre when it came out when I was in high school. Perhaps this too will make more kids check out the classic horror films. There have been TV episodes of shows and books where people have ended up in horror movies, but I can't think of a movie that used this idea before. It's a fun film, you're best to watch one of the Friday the 13th sequels with Jason to appreciate the homage movie that is being used for these teens to go into before watching this though.  Like all horror films there are holes in the plot and things you could nitpick about, such as if the mother was in a horror film that is celebrating it's 20th anniversary surely it would have been made in the 90's at the earliest instead of the early 80's.  Unless it was period piece film of course but that isn't mentioned.  I'd definitely watch a sequel if they made one, perhaps the survivors could end up in a homage movie to Nightmare on Elm Street, the other big horror franchise of my childhood.",1451001600,,2546,4.274428274428274

7369222,4,B013P0WZ86,"Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman) played Nancy in ""Camp Blood Bath"" a cult classic with a ""Friday  the 13th"" script. She has a daughter Max (Taissa Farmiga) and loves the song ""Bette Davis Eyes.""  Amanda dies in a traffic accident and three years later Max is coerced into going to a reunion showing of the film ""Camp Blood Bath.""  During the feature Max and five of her friends get sucked into the film and integrate with the original cast which includes Max's deceased mother.

The film is a comedy-horror. Taissa Farmiga nails the film. The way her eyes tear up and get glassy during scenes with her mom were actually too good and brought the comedy aspect down. The comedy and horror aspect could have been better. Many parts of the film had a sense of deja vu due to similarity with classic films, something they needed to extend to the entire film, i.e.. ""Scary Movie.""

The concept for the film came from  co-writer Joshua John Miller, whose dad Jason Miller ( Father Karras) died in the ""Exorcist."" He grew up watching his dad die in a film and wondered what it would be like if he was in the film with him.

This is a good film, but seems to have been hyped in hopes of getting a lasting cult status. The writing just wasn't that great.

7369273,3,B013P0WZ86,"Deconstructions of horror movies are fairly common place, and even the ones that tend to be the most self-aware are essentially love letters to the genre. The Scream movies probably walked the best balance between self-deprecating humor and real thrills, subverting the genre in a way that has only been matched by The Cabin In the Woods. Now it's time for a something a little different, because while those other films are indeed love letters, none can attest to being both a love story and a slasher film. But The Final Girls can make that claim as a film that celebrates both classic horror movies and the love between a mother and daughter.

The surprising thing about The Final Girls is how much emotional heft it has for a slasher comedy, and it all begins with the relationship between Max (Taissa Farmiga) and her mother Amanda (Malin Akerman), a former ""scream queen"" who has never recovered from her iconic role in 1980s slasher film, ""Camp Bloodbath"". The two are close, with Max recognizing her mom's struggles. So when Amanda is killed in a freak accident, years pass without Max truly getting over it. Convinced by her genre-clich friends: best pal Gertie (Alia Shawkat), hot mean girl Vicki (Nina Dobrev), horror know-it-all Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), and high school hunk Chris (Alexander Ludwig), to attend an anniversary screening of Camp Bloodbath, Max reluctantly agrees. But when the theater catches on fire, the only way out is to escape through the screen, which opens up some kind of wormhole into the movie itself.

What's next is a little like Hot Tub Time Machine, only a Hell of a lot funnier and a lot cleverer. Max and her friends are not only trapped in the retro '80s but they're stuck within Bloodbath, and the only way to get home is to survive the 92-minute runtime without being murdered by a Jason Voorhees-type killer. They'll also have to endure a bunch of walking stereotypes, from Adam DeVine's insanely oversexed dude, to the doomed African-American character, and the tough girl (Chloe Bridges) who is destined to survive and be the ""final girl"". For Max, all of these characters are secondary to the heartbreaking presence of her own mother in the role that made her famous and ruined her life. Their encounters are tinged with sadness, but they allow Max a chance to resolve her grief and come to grips with the woman her mother was.

While that may sound pretty downbeat for a comedy like this, director Todd Strauss-Schulson (A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas) has a number of funny visual gags that keep the film light. There's the enclosed, magical reality of the world they're trapped in, which manifests in unexpected ways. If they try to simply walk out of the camp they end up in a time loop right back where they started. Breaking from the Camp Bloodbath plotline confuses the crap out of the characters, including the killer whose sole purpose is hacking to death anyone who has sex. If you ever wanted to know what it would feel like to experience a flashback sequence, The Final Girls answers that question to hilarious effect. The film plays around with horror tropes in a way that fans of the genre will appreciate, and this is probably a movie best seen with a group of like-minded friends.

Ultimately The Final Girls is about how movies can be a tool for helping us overcome the pain of loss, a lesson we don't expect to learn from a slasher film. We expect the characters in these films, especially the female ones, to be disposable, but The Final Girls makes us care about Max and Amanda's future. While this sub-set of horror movies can probably slither away and die now, this is one that makes for a very welcome entry.",1448323200,,3688,4.7398753894081

7369330,5,B013P0WZ86,"Sometimes blurbs can be deceiving; sometimes they don't tell enough. It was the latter when I chose this DVD. I expected a mystery. What I got was a little gem of a satire of slasher movies.  The daughter of a deceased movie star agrees to attend the anniversary showing of her two most famous films...slashers. A fire in the theater (and who allows smoking in a theater? Where were the ushers?) send her and her friends cutting a hole through the screen and crawling to safety...they think.  Alas, all that does is take them into the movie, where they have to remember the story and help the script to its conclusion in order to escape...perhaps, with the help of the Final Girl...the one who survives to do in the monster.

There are a few twists and turns and a lot of digs at the revered genre, as well as a couple of poignant moments as the daughter finds herself bonding with her mother's younger, fictitious character from the film.

A fun premise (modern teens being transported into a classic campy '80s slasher flick and vying to be the last one alive at the end of the movie) ... entertaining performances (in a campy way), fun and cheesy takes on '80s slasher film culture. But perhaps the biggest surprise was the mother-daughter story, which was at the heart of the whole movie and really nicely played. I was surprised to get choked up a little bit, even. Definitely not what I expected, but it gave this film some weight that made it a probably a much better film than it otherwise would have been. I enjoyed it a lot... as a ""horror-comedy,"" it's nice, light-hearted, PG-13 alternative to the usual brutal bloodbaths.",1447113600,28,765,4.550724637681159
7369345,5,B013P0WZ86,"Yes, there are a couple of issues that can be had with this film, to be fair.  Low on gore and profanity, no nudity, wonky timeline and some anachronisms.  The film-within-a-film can't decide which part of the '80s it's from.  Malin Akerman, who is younger than I, could not have been an older teen then.  I wish the present timeline had been ambiguous, or set in the '90s. There was a definite TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D timeline thing going on here.
But my fellow horror fan daughter and I watched this together.  We laughed, we cried, we screamed, we yelled at the screen.  She described it as ""'Teen Beach Movie' if Eric Kripke had written it.""  I have to agree with her.  It was a fun amusement park ride.  Shout-outs to the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise, SLEEPAWAY CAMP, THE BURNING, and even (if only on paper) SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE and CHOPPING MALL.  Malin Akerman is the Amy Steel/Ginny Field of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2.
The nascence of the film was Joshua John Miller trying to deal with the death of his father, EXORCIST actor Jason Miller.  The film does have a heart, and you find yourself caring about the characters.  The running time is a trim 91 minutes, which is perfect.

I do hope these folks make a sequel, which is promising given the trope ending, which I won't spoil.  Something that gives more of a shout-out to other '80s slashers, not just the summer camp subgenre.

Great family fun, if you're family is weird and into that stuff, like mine is.  I'm a long-time horror/slasher fan.  Seen it all, from THE DEVIL'S CASTLE (1896), through the Universals, the RKOs, the Hammers, the slashers, the Gothics, the torture porns, Japanese goodies, giallo, revenge flicks, cannibal flicks, erotic vampires... the whole bloody enchilada.  I really dug this film.  Kudos to the filmmakers and my hat's off to Taissa Farmiga for being an even more amazing, meticulous actress than her sister Vera. She really nailed this picture to the wall like Michael Myers with a kitchen knife.

Your mileage may vary, but check out this little gem.  Hope you enjoy it half as much as we.",1447113600,,2078,4.653846153846154

Loved it so much I bought the DVD. Hope there's a sequel, but it would be pretty hard to live up to this one. 5 solid stars! Definitely recommended.",1447027200,,321,4.278688524590164
7369347,5,B013P0WZ86,"This film is amazing! The cast is perfect and the story line is far beyond what I could ever conceive. First take and make your own fake movie and company logo! Then add in a plot where one of the main characters loses a mother that she can see alive again while in the fake movie. The movie is a honest movie and it takes it's self seriously. All the relationships are strong and emotional. Also the effect that the kids that get sucked into the film have is pure fun.

I've looked at the reviews for this from the new york times .... etc .... etc...
saying that it steals plots (well that's the point, its trying to mimic classic horror film slashers) and that there's already plenty of parody's out there referring movies like scream, scary movie and the paranormal  activity spoofs. (scream is good by its self, but this is different than scream and far more original than any spoofs that have come before it.
also i'm tired of the stupid sexual and weed jokes from those movies, I mean we did graduate from middle school right?
and if this movie can be even better without an R rating than that's saying something.

In a nut shell this movie is an owe to all the crappy slasher movies of the day and it reinvents itself with lovable characters, emotional moments and just plain fun to watch. Trust me you don't want to miss out!!!

The movie has everything, a very refreshing and original storyline and a great appealing cast (Taissa Farmiga from American Horror Story, Nina Dobrev from The Vampire Diaries and Alexander Ludwig from The Hunger Games). I expected it to be great, but not as awesome as it actually is!
The Final Girls isn't afraid of playing with the 80's slasher movie formula, managing to keep the movie scary, but so funny and refreshing for horror movie fans. The movie also has a very touching side that honestly plays a big part of making the movie so great. This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, from horror to touching drama, all the elements are well used, making this movie very enjoyable and one of the best horror movies of the last years, along with The Cabin In The Woods.

Now they must not only survive the movie but Max wants to save her mom as well. This is just a flat out fun movie to watch. Horror comedies, when done well, are some of the most entertaining movies being made. This is one of them. Even though the movie has a type of Teen Beach Movie feel to it this one is sooooo much better. As a side note Malin Akerman is actually becoming a very good actress.

First, the PG-13 rating was really disappointing, it should've either been rated R or Unrated. It is supposed to be a homage or ""love letter to 80s slashers"" as it states. Well, there are certain staples of 80s slashers that are missing, namely violence & gore. Theres some but little gore & some kills are just downright funny. The actors however did a very good job & there are also some very funny lines as well.  Also it was just a bit too sentimental. If you like horror/comedy films this will be enjoyable for you but if you want to see what I feel is a real homage & ""love letter to 80s slashers"" then watch Lost After Dark.

7369464,4,B013P0WZ86,"I was looking for an entertaining film to watch on Halloween, and I sure wasn't disappointed with THE FINAL GIRLS. The basic premise is that a group of friends at a horror marathon end up getting trapped in the movie itself and have to find a way to survive. Brilliant, right? Arguably the best part of the movie is the way that it makes fun of horror clichs, particularly those in the slasher genre. They also poke fun at the horrible writing and bad acting. Basically, it does for slasher films what CABIN IN THE WOODS did for ""cabin in the woods""/Evil Dead-type films. The acting, even though some of it was intentionally bad, was decent. There weren't too many well-known actors, so nobody really stood out in that respect. I did recognize Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman, and for what it's worth, they did well. However, my favorite character was the dumb blonde. She provided the most laughs for me. Adam Devine was ok, but it reminded me too much of his work in PITCH PERFECT. From a technical standpoint, everything was rather solid. Camerawork was good, and I thought they did a good job toning down R-rated violence for a PG-13. They even get a good joke out of using black-and-white for a flashback sequence. All things considered, THE FINAL GIRLS was a clever genre sendup that makes mostly good use out of the material its parodying. To sweeten it further, there were a couple of scenes that seemed stolen from my dreams, as Taissa Farmiga's character and I have something in common that I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. Let's just say there was one part that got me a little emotional. The only thing that keeps me from going higher with the rating is that the film kind of backs off from a ""your destiny is up to you"" message and falls back on the clichs it had been making fun of up to that point. Other than that, I thought it was an easy watch with plenty of laughs that should entertain most viewers who are into horror movies.",1446336000,,1965,4.4916201117318435

7369505,4,B013P0WZ86,"This film is all about celebrating metamoviedom.  Not kills, not gore, not action, but geeky commentary and smart, playful satire.  I highly recommend it and would even prescribe it to people who generally don't like horror movies.

Director Todd Strauss-Schulson is responsible for this playful metamovie, presenting a movie within a movie premise in which the protagonists must follow the classic horror axioms in order to survive the film into which they are magically transported.  As a true honorarium to early summer camp horror, the film in question has a poster reminiscent of The Burning (1981) and is called is Camp Blood, which was the original working title for Friday the 13th (1980).

Clearly mirroring Camp Crystal Lake, the film is complete with ch ch ch ka ka ka which our protagonists can actually hear as if they were watching the very movie that has entrapped them!  They also make interesting use of flashbacks as a metamovie filmmaking device to escape the killer.  The flashbacks tell the killers origin story and its very much akin to that of Jason Vorrhees, including the flashback timeframe (1957) and the present day timeframe of Camp Blood (1986).  Its all in good fun and it will light up smiles on fans of 80s horror.

This film knows exactly what it is and it uses that effectively to entertain viewers with nods to things we love about the 80s horror era.  Manic power geek Duncan (Thomas Middleditch; Silicon Valley) assumes Jamie Kennedys Scream role as the meta-analyst and Camp Blood expert of the group.  His knowledge of horror movies and Camp Blood helps them to safely navigate this horror fantasy world and understand the rulesfor a while anyway.  He makes silly comments about how the characters behave, knowing the lines of the script, and how they should treat their experience like they're in a nature preserve: don't interrupt, only observe.  He is the key character that connects us to the theme.

Max (Taissa Farmiga; American Horror Story) is the typical final girl, a likable sympathetic virgin.  Perhaps a namesake in honor of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Maxs mother is Nancy (Malin Akerman; Watchmen), a single mother struggling to find work who was a scream queen in the cult classic Camp Blood (fictionally made in 1986).  In the real world Nancy died in a car accident, so when we find her character again in Camp Blood, Max has the opportunity to reconnect with her even if its under the guise that they are peers working together for the summer.  This gets particularly entertaining when Nancy talks about sleeping with Kurt (Adam DeVine; Pitch Perfect), the over-sexed alpha bro.

Kurt brings loads of comic relief and the characters are rounded out with Chris (Alexander Ludwig; Vikings, The Hunger Games), Vicki (Nina Dobrev; The Vampire Diaries) and Tina (Angela Trimbur; Halloween II).  I was pleased with the acting and story, and even more pleased with the nuances.  Most notably the color correction of the forest plants and flowers was starkly in brilliant contrast, as if the protagonists had just been displaced to Oz.

As if their horror microcosm comprised only the scenes and sets of Camp Blood, attempts to escape the camp site loop them right back and it even affects the behavior of the Camp Blood characters.  Once the group has a handle on the metamovie rules they discover that one of them has to be the final girl and, in fact, their idea of who that should be and why shifts a bit.  They also use tropes that lead to death (i.e., implications of nudity) to set a trap for the killer.  How that turns out will delight viewers.

There are some very funny death scenes but gore is kept to a minimum and scares are completely absent (in lieu of comedy).

7369526,4,B013P0WZ86,"The Final Girls is a fun spoof of 80's horror conventions, coming at it from a different meta angle than Scream did in the 90's. In this outing, Max (Taissa Farmiga) is talked into being the guest of honor at a memorial screening of her late mother's (Malin Ackerman) best known film, an 80's slasher called Camp Bloodbath. In fine horror tradition, Max and her friends are meant to be high school seniors - the most mature looking high school seniors you've ever seen. They all attend the movie screening, where things go awry and via a symbolic act I won't spoil, they wind up in the movie. It's kind of like when Alice got trapped in that Western, except instead of Freddie Krueger, this group runs afoul of Billy Murphy. Don't worry, you'll learn the backstory of Billy Murphy. You'll learn it in a hilarious flashback sequence. The kids realize that in order to escape the movie, they have to live through it by hitching their wagon to the Final Girl. Except, Max is determined that this time the Final Girl will be the one her mother played. The script has great fun cracking wise on the tropes of the slasher genre, as well as the occasional ribbing of current horror storytelling conventions. Underneath all that meta humor it's also making some very interesting observations on archetypes in general and socially valued qualities of female archetypes in particular. It's got some flaws - the script is so focused on archetypes it forgot to make the characters fully three-dimensional - but it has a fantastic cast and very good production values, and it's definitely worth a watch if you love the genre.",1445558400,,1612,4.719858156028369

The comedy was in places way too broad, yet I also loved Thomas Middleditch and Adam Devine in this.
The scenery, props, and settings are all too candy colored and stylized to really look like they belong in an 80s horror film, yet they are lush and gorgeous and memorable.

Malin Akerman is way to young looking to convincingly play the mother of Taissa Farmiga, and yet she also helps give the movie the emotional core that drives the plot and keeps the action believable and meaningful. And she does this by just being a fantastic actor.

So for every part that doesn't work out of context they still add to the overall successes. And for every over the top or supremely meta-moment there are just as many smaller moments that add an odd kind of reality to the premise- such as Alia Shawkat's truly realistic reactions to people's deaths or Nina Dobrev's apology for her previous behavior as the mean girl.

Accepting the pieces of the puzzle that don't quite fit allowed me to enjoy this movie for the funny, quirky, and moving flick that it was. I actually had a real (if slightly embarrassing) emotional response to the ending. And the strip tease scene with Angela Trimbur is an absolute breakout comedic performance.

But even if you are not familiar with movies like ""Jason"" or ""Halloween"", you will still enjoy ""Final Girls"". The movie is self-contained and does not depend on inside jokes or obscure allusions to 80s pop culture (though there are a few of these).

It is defiantly PG-13 with no nudity which if your tapping into 80's horror that was a core ingredient especially since they are aware it it themselves moving the plot forward.  This seems to have a niche audience of kids who want to pretend they are watching an adult horror movie but can't hear swear words or see skin.  Though these days kids are so desensitized that watching Saw 7 in the theater there were junior high kids laughing at the torture so I don't know who the audience is.

I have been watching so many horror movies for my blog and this is the only one I've watched twice.  I knew from the very beginning I was going to love this movie. It's got a couple of emotional scenes in it that will probably bring a tear to your eye.  But, it's also ridiculously fun without being absurd.  Taissa Farmiga turns in an emotional and believable performance as Max and Malin kerman as her Mother and Nancy the camp counselor plays off that emotion brilliantly.  Everyone in this movie gives an exceptional performance.

One night the revival of the film at the local theater, Max, along with her best friend Gertie (Alia Shawkat), Gerties brother Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), Maxs crush Chris (Alexander Ludwig), and Chris ex-girlfriend Vicki (Nina Dobrev) escape a fire in the building by going through the theater screen. However, the group then finds they have been transported into the very movie they had been watching. Unable to escape, the group realizes the only way to make it out of the movie is to follow the rules of a slasher film. As the masked killer Billy begins to kill off the characters of the original film, Max is determined to get her friends, and her mother out alive.

The Final Girls is the latest slasher movie that appears in the form of a comedy. Where most combinations of the two fail, this one succeeds. Its an excellent parody of the slasher subgenre that features plays on the tropes that appear in those films. While it is self-aware of the slasher genre, it still captures the heart of slashers by playing out those tropes in some of the most fun ways possible. Not only this but it cleverly collides the world of 80s slashers and modern day ones. The stereotypical characters from the 80s are here with their very dim-witted knowledge, and then we have our present day characters with their knowledge of horror films and bringing in the world of technology. The way these two world are combined helps boost the story in a very interesting territory that help move it along. The film is rated PG-13, and for a slasher that is a no-no. While I do think the film would have served much better with an R rating and showing some nice blood with the kills, due to the context of the story, the PG-13 rating fits well enough. Despite this it still gives off the slasher film vibe and pays good tribute to it, most especially Friday the 13th. The movie within the movie is essentially Friday the 13th in general, and that alone parodies it quite well. Adding the the nods to the tropes including the stereotypical characters, the sex=death angle, the virgin must survive, and of course the flashback to the story of the killer, along with others. But in its core, The Final Girls also features a deep story with Max trying to reconnect with her mother (even though its just the character mother plays), surprisingly enough, the emotions within it work, and it doesnt get so over-the-top that it detracts the from the horror story. The comedy in the film delivers plenty of laughs, much of it due to the comical characters and even the kills are humorous in how they play out. The whole film is a fun ride that you want from a slasher film, and adding the comedy makes it even better. However, it does leave us with an ending that will leave some scratching their head wondering where exactly it was supposed to be headed.

What really makes the movie fantastic is the cast and characters. The 80s characters are the stereotypical airheads who are only interested in sex, drugs, and partying and the actors including Malin Akerman and Adam Devine shine in their roles as the shy, virginal girl, and the horny pervert. Akermans sweetness and sincerity shines throughout the movie, and despite the awkward mother/daughter casting between she and Tassia Farmiga, the two have amazing chemistry and Akerman really delivers in the motherly role while also playing the main girl in the slasher solidly. Devine is hysterical in his role and provides some of the more, if not the most funniest moments. He essentially is the comic relief of the film and does it with ease. Also providing comic relief in a surprising performance is Angela Trimbur as the slut of the the 80s film. This character was easily my favorite and Trimbur was clearly having fun with the role and does a marvelous job providing just as many laughs as Devines character. With our young cast we have Tassia Farmiga as our main girl. Now I have never been a fan of Farmigas, but she does a fantastic job here and was perfect as the shy, girl-next-door type who has to play the hero, and in her battle with the killer she massively impressed me with the toughness she brought to the character when she needed it. But most especially it was the emotional moments that she needed to bring to the character that really made her acting shine. You can feel the combination of sadness and happiness of the character even in just Farmigas facial expressions. Put both of these together and you get a genuine main girl that you root for in a slasher film. Nina Dobrev is also surprising in her escape from her role in The Vampire Diaries as Vicki, the clingy, bitchy, ex-girlfriend to Alexander Ludwigs character. Dobrev sells the bitchiness, but also shows that there is more to her character than that as the film progresses. I was also impressed with her excellent comedic timing, she doesnt hold up compared to Devine and Trimbur but I found her the funniest of the main group. The rest of the cast does extremely well with their roles and stay in character the whole time. Overall, the cast is just downright amazing all of the characters are likable. What sets these characters apart from other slasher films is that despite the stereotypes (which they are very aware of), they actually pretty damn smart and sensible (especially Nina Dobrevs character surprisingly).

The Final Girls is an excellent slasher that despite its tame rating provides the right amount of spirit and respect to slashers old and new and gives us great comedy with it by playing with the horror tropes, and also giving a pretty sincere and moving subplot of mother and daughter. Along with this is an excellent and lovable set of characters that you find yourself wanting any one of them to make it out alive. The cast I couldn't praise more who have such amazing chemistry together and really bring the characters personalities and emotions to life.

7369597,4,B013P0WZ86,"The Final Girls is a fun and interesting change of pace in the form of a slasher homage. Stocked with familiar faces from a variety of TV shows like Silicon Valley, Arrested Development, Vikings and more, this movie accomplishes exactly what it set out to. Blurring the lines between fantasy and reality, we step into a fictional slasher film called ""Camp Bloodbath"" (a three way homage of Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp and The Burning) where characters in 'The Final Girls' are forced to figure out how to end the movie.

The film hit on several notes, it was scary(ish) at times, funny and even sentimental (probably not something you would have expected). It seems the story was well thought out and the idea was executed equally as well, which was quite impressive for an obviously low budget flick.

If I had any criticisms about the movie it would be that it really needed an R-rating to be truly faithful to it's source material (even the fake movie 'Camp Bloodbath' was rated R). The other would be that instead of using under-budget CG, they should have used more practical effects (again homaging the slasher horror flicks of the 1980's).

7369607,4,B013P0WZ86,"With The Final Girls, five modern day teenagers find themselves trapped inside of a 92-minute 80s horror film.called Camp Bloodbath. The movie is amusing and sometimes (rarely) bloody, but where it works best is when it focuses on Max (Taissa Farmiga) coping with the loss of her mother, Amanda (Malin Akerman), who just so happened to be one of the stars of Camp Bloodbath.

The movie was beautifully filmed, even on a low budget. The colors were vibrant and fantastical, and the methods used to transport the characters through different portions of their experience were unique and fun. It was obvious a lot of thought was put about what it might be like slipping inside a movie. Was it real or a dream? Does it matter? That's up to you to decide.

If you're looking for a fun popcorn movie that will make you laugh, scream once or twice and possibly even tear up a little, go to see The Final Girls or buy or rent it on Amazon. It's definitely worth it, not just for the cast, but for the clever romp inside an 80s horror movie.",1444867200,,1032,4.48404255319149

Similiar to Scream, there are rules about the genre the characters discuss in their attempt to survive, but very original in its take on mixing 21st century characters with 80s horror film characters.

The story was very clever, and right off the bat you cared so much about the protagonist and the set up!  I grew up on these types of horror 80's films that the group get ""trapped in"" and the director and cast hit every right note when portraying what it would be like if this were a real scenario! Not to mention there were so many laugh out loud moments with the way they handled it! When our protagonist meets her mom inside the movie , it then took a whole other surprise turn, and you found yourself moved by what you were watching! When does that happen in a horror/comedy?! From that point on, hilarity and suspense ensue, and character development start to happen to characters you wrote off as a stereotype until these beautifully crafted moments.  I found myself wanting every one to live! And  MINOR SPOILER ALERT when a certain character didn't make it, I actually felt the pain of it more so than I have ever felt in most horror movies! I can't say enough about this movie! The soundtrack rocks! How they got these songs for an indie film is a small miracle in itself, but thank god they pulled it off. It totally adds to the film! And the overall visual look of this film is astounding ! I read that the director wanted you to feel like you were in that moment when Dorothy steps from sepia into color when she goes into OZ, and that is exactly how it feels an looks! It is gorgeous! When can you say that about a horror movie?!  All I can say is, I hope people rent this movie and spread the word and rent it over and over again, because we need a SEQUEL!!!!  LOVED IT!!!

To be honest I tried so hard not to like this film. Well not at first, at first I thought ""cool another HORROR COMEDY"", but then when it started and I glimpsed the set-up I really felt that I was not gonna like this film. At first I thought the introduction to the protagonists was hokey, then when we see how the story comes about with the cast entering the fictional film playing at the theatre I thought-""WTF? Am I suppose to buy this?"". It was a bit of an issue with me, eating at me through pretty much the whole film-I really wanted to know the ""HOW"". Oh well, that being said, Schulson's creativity, and fresh spin on the horror spoof is so well executed that I couldn't help but enjoy the ride.

The character contrast between our ""real cast"" and the ""fictional cast"" is so entertaining, especially with the comedy side of ""The Final Girls"". The cliche horror stereotypes meeting the somewhat ""real world"" cliche characters captured my attention. The seasoned acting between the up-and-coming Hollywood stars and the star-wattage of seasoned stars like Malin Akerman and Nina Dobrev is pure candy. The real star in this film is the script! The writing is just so good that even the things that irritated me, held my attention. The scenes are so emotional, dark, humorous, and visual - just perfectly done. Kudos to the crew and cast of ""The Final Girls"" on all that!

The special effects were ""Hollywood"". What can you say, the practical effects, make-up skill, and CGI are so well produced that you get both a indie slasher homage, and total 80's popcorn effect. The CGI is done in a way that makes it as enjoyable as the splatter gore practical effects-that is a big ""yay"" for me because CGI tends to be a bummer personally when watching horror films. This time it all just worked perfectly. The soundtrack is methodical and precise. It plays on 80 slasher nostalgia and really connects you to the atmosphere of the scenes-both the campy ""characters in a fictional horror film and knowing it"" aspect, and the actual intimate, emotional relationship scenes that really develop the characters.

Overall ""The Final Girls"" really comes close to hitting on all cylinders as the perfect slasher spoof. There is still that annoying ""HOW"" that lingers through the film, the almost too obvious and expected ""Hallmarky"" moments, and the fact that you pretty much know exactly how the scenes are gonna play out, and the general reaction from the characters, because it has to play out that way because it was set up to play out that way. Still the masterful way that Todd Strauss-Schulson pulls all the sweet and savory horror, and comedy stuff together in a visually delightful film- and don't forget the writing and cast- all just make ""The Final Girls"" a really fun and awesome viewing experience that fans should really enjoy!",1444608000,,2853,4.757575757575758

The Final Girls is one of those movies where even discussing the plot inevitably gives away spoilers, so if you want to watch this without knowing anything important in advance you probably shouldn't read any reviews.  The film opens with a young woman named Max (Taissa Farmiga, pretty wonderful) driving home with her mom (Malin Akerman, almost as good) who was a scream queen in the 1980's but whose career has been on the rocks recently.  The scene of their drive together is beautifully written and played, showing in a brief few moments how loving and warm their mother-daughter relationship is before tragedy strikes in the form of a nasty car crash.

On the one year anniversary of her mom's death Max is roped into going to a screening of her mom's most famous movie, Camp Bloodbath, by the promise of her homework done for a year by the brother of her best friend who is also sponsoring the screening.  A fire breaks out in the movie theater and the only way Max and her friends can escape is by cutting through the movie screen with a machete someone dropped in panic to escape--but when they get to the other side Max and her friends find themselves literally trapped inside the world of Camp Bloodbath and its characters.  Eventually, they figure out the only way home is to make it to the end of the movie alive, after which they hope to return to their own world.

In its concept of people trapped in a well-known fictional universe, The Final Girls frequently recalls Pleasentville, a movie about a brother and sister who end up inside a television world very similar to Mayberry.  In its characters playful knowledge of slasher movie tropes The Final Girls also calls to mind the original Scream and the much less well-known Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, at least on paper.  But the thing that's most shocking about The Final Girls is that it never tries to be scary or even particularly funny, mostly settling for cute and sweet.

Cute and sweet are not two words one normally associates with the 1980's slasher genre.  In fact, if you believed many critics at the time slasher movies were nothing short of a sign of the oncoming apocalypse.  But what seemed transgressive to middle-aged critics like Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and Rex Reed in the 1980's seems very tame now that the original audience for those films is itself middle-aged, leaving us to be appalled (or possibly entertained) by the far more extreme likes of the Saw and Hostel series which makes any Friday the 13th films look positively wholesome in comparison.

Taissa Farmiga's Max can't pass by the opportunity to spend time with her mom again, even if it isn't really her mom but her most famous role.  But the thing is actors put something of themselves in their work and there turns out to be much more of Max's mom in the fictional Nancy than even Max could have expected.

The bonding scenes between Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman are surprisingly sweet and affecting and provide the unexpected emotional heart of the movie, but the sweetness tends to extend to the other characters as well, including best friend Gertie (Alie Shawkat) who finds herself falling for one of the doomed characters in the movie and former best friend Vicki (Nina Dobrev) who knows her chances of survival aren't good since she's the mean girl in the second half of a 1980's slasher movie.

It's hard not to wish The Final Girls was a little bit more inspired and a bit funnier or that they came up with more of a Back to the Future/Hot Tub Time Machine type ending which would have been appropriate since the characters spend most of their time trapped in a movie version of the 1980's.  The movie ends instead abruptly and on a pretty unsatisfying note.  But The Final Girls is also the first 1980's slasher movie homage that might actually make you cry because of the tender performances by Taissa Farminga and Malin Akerman and their sweet scenes together.  The latter's fictional character is initially what she was written to be--the shy girl with the clipboard--but after she survives the scene where she was supposed to die (because of Max's aggressive intervention) her character gradually becomes richer and more alive.

Horror movie fans looking for a fix might find themselves disappointed with this one--but it's also probably a great date movie that will appeal to girls more than their boyfriends.  Don't go into The Final Girls expecting shocks and gore and violence and you might end up being surprised, maybe even in a good way.",1444608000,2,4560,4.746835443037975

By the final showdown, you really grew to care about what happened to these people.  This movie had a very strong emotional core.

7369685,5,B013P0WZ86,"I just finished watching this movie and I would HIGHLY recommend it for any fan of 80's slasher films. This is such a huge love letter to the sub genre and honestly one of the best meta horror films I have seen in quite a long time. This movie is a Scream-esque version of Friday the 13th meets The Burning.

The cast is spot on. With a campy movie like this it could easily have become just a terrible slasher parody but the cast was terrific. Standouts for me were Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman as the mother-daughter pair and Angela Trimbur as Tina, the oversexed camp counselor.

The script was very good and at times, surprisingly poignant. The 80's characters are given terrible one-liners and awkward sentences but it's all part of the charm of the movie. And in small subtle moments that may not be caught if you're just casually viewing the characters are given actual bits of characterization (resident mean girl Vicki gets a chance to explain why shes so angry, All-American jock Chris is the only one to admit he's scared, etc).

Overall, I think this film was brilliantly written, acted, and directed. After seeing the film I immediately preordered the Blu-Ray and hope that it comes out soon. I can't wait to show this one to my horror loving friends.

The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.

While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick its reasonably entertaining, especially if you're familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. Its also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, whos one of the most alluring females in the cast, although shes outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.

8728271,5,B013P0WZ86,"Overview: If you ever found yourself thinking ""I wish they made a sequel to Cabin in the Woods"" but were frustrated that they couldn't because (spoiler alert!) the entire planet was destroyed, you'll want to stop reading this and check out The Final Girls.

Plot: 5/5
(Spoiler Free!) The plot of TFG is a direct homage to the also-wonderful Cabin in the Woods, a self-aware meta horror comedy to literally end all horror comedies. However, there is more emotional depth here than at first glance. (Mild Spoiler) A girl and her friends are transported into her deceased typecast actress mother's slasher film from the 80's and band together with the camp counselors to survive a machete-wielding maniac. An unconventional plot, and one that uses a surprising amount of raw emotion in its execution.

Visuals: 4/5
Overall, the visuals of the movie are spot-on. Whether it's reality melting away during a flashback and dripping down the screen like honey and the characters commenting on their sudden lack of color or ending credits appearing in the sky, this movie plays wonderfully with visuals to help the story. You truly get the sense that you were placed inside an actual 80's horror movie. There are a few instances where the modern touch seems out of place given the 80's feel (when one character gets hit with a car, the CGI is laughable), but overall the visuals are excellent and help remind you that they are inside of an old horror film.

Sound: 5/5
The lack of jump scares helps ease the audience into accepting the 'comedy' aspect of the movie, but the horror sounds are there as well. Classic ""Jason-esque"" approach sounds and 80's glam rock are ever-present and help set the scene. However, even sound is used to help reinforce the movie-within-a-movie feel, as characters comment on slow motion sound effects being used.

Pacing: 5/5
Horror comedy movies often suffer from terrible pacing issues, but not TFG. This is helped by the wacky nature of the meta narrative, as the viewer will always be wondering how the film will bend genre tropes or poke fun at itself next. The emotional elements also add a refreshing weight to the pace, ensuring no scene feels 'dead'.

Fear Factor: 5/5
This section should appropriately read 'lack of fear factor', but this is a good thing! The movie itself is much more on the silly comedic side than the horror side, however the true fear is in the emotional realizations of the characters. The movie manipulates emotions in the best way, leaving the audience to grapple with the idea that fear of loss can be the most powerful fear of all.

Final Score: 5/5

Verdict: A meta horror comedy that couples the zaniness of Cabin in the Woods with the emotional gravity of the ending of the first Saw film to be 3 parts laughter and 1 part tears, leaving the audience amused and with a lot to think about.",1534032000,,2850,4.757085020242915

8728275,4,B013P0WZ86,"This was better than ""The Cabin In The Woods"" and definitely better than ""Scream 3"", which wasted its potential in that franchise. This movie does a great job blending a variety of genres, and plays with archetypes brilliantly. Way funnier than the previews let on, and glad I saw it, because I missed this somehow when it first came out. While scary, it was not overtly gory, and did a great job spoofing 80's horror/slasher flicks. Definitely worth watching, you will not regret it. Works great for a date night at home, or a movie night with friends that are into comedy and/or horror. Thumbs up for sure!",1531699200,,608,4.638888888888889
