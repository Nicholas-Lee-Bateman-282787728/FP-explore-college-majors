2546636,5,B000EXZKRG,"This volume contains the second four episodes of a great "" Monster of the week show"""".It was around this time that the programs title was changed from Godzilla Power Hour to The Godzilla Super 90. Every week Godzilla

faught a new monster. What made this a little better than other american incarnations such as the Marvel

and Dark Horse comics was the use of monsters who were completely original in concept. The comics always used Toho rip off monster. (ie. Monsters who are vaguely similar to Toho characters). There are no fake King Kongs, Rodans or Mechagodzillas here. Its all original creations, like an Ultraman show. Some fans have complained about the lack of classic toho characters, but I think the repetitious over use of the same characters is what bogged down the later Showa Godzilla Movies and the more recent ones. (Will you guys at Toho please give Mothra and King Ghidorah a vacation!)  Introducing a new foe each week is a much better approach.

Monsters episodes:

Episode 5: The Seaweed Monster is an ever growing patch of kelp.

episode 6: Alien Energy Beast is a giant glowing size changing centepede type creature that arrives in a flying

saucer and can assume the form of anything, including Godzilla.

episode 7: Collossus is agiant one eyed, tentacled alien robot from the lost civilisation of Atlantis, revealed to be a giant flying saucer.

episode 8: Cyclops. An ancient alien civilization left behind an invisible energy field on a lost island, to keep the mythilogical Cyclops, here depicted as a crad like biped with lobster claws. We are never told where the cyclops came from. Is he an ancient earth creature or did he arrive with the aliens.

This is supposedly the last volumeto be released and there are no plans to releae any more.",1170806400,,1774,4.8250825082508255
2546637,5,B000EXZKRG,"This DVD is called ""Godzilla: The Original Animated Series Volume 2.""

This DVD contains 4 episodes of the 1970s Hanna Barbera Godzilla cartoon. They are:

The Seaweed Monster - A monster made of seaweed attacks the Calico. Godzilla comes by and saves the day. But a few pieces of seaweed have broken off the creature. These pieces start growing into new monsters. And one of them is on board the Calico. This is an excellent episode.

The Energy Beast - A spaceship lands on earth. A giant alien comes out of the spaceship. The alien disguises itself as a tree. Later on, the Calico's crew is stunned to see Godzilla attacking a city. This is a wonderful episode.

The Colossus Of Atlantis - This is one of my favorite episodes of the series. The city of Atlantis rises out of the ocean. The Calico's crew visits the city. The Calico gets destroyed. It seems that the people of Atlantis liked to watch movies on DVDs, which Dr. Darian calls ""history discs."" A giant robot that was built to guard Atlantis ends up malfunctioning, and becomes a danger to the city and its inhabitants. This is an excellent episode.

The Horror Of Forgotten Island - This fantastic episode combines science fiction with ancient mythology. A long time ago, some friendly aliens visited the earth. They landed on a small island. They discovered a giant cyclops monster. In order to prevent the cyclops from leaving the island and terrorizing the people of earth, the aliens built a giant electromagnetic force field to keep the creature trapped on the island. But now a lightning storm has caused the force field to malfunction. The Calico's crew has to reactivate the force field. This episode is one of the reasons why I love this show so much.",1144800000,19,1725,4.698675496688741

I couldn't handle my child being sad and forever looking for something he watched every morning so I came where I near I'd find it. Amazon.com is my go to for almost everything. I had order this volume and the other one - after ordering it I told my son that I had a surprise for him that would be here very soon. Once it arrived I gave him both boxes, helped him open them and had a very happy camper.

Both DVD's works flawlessly. They have 3-4 series on them, all of which he watched over and over on Netflix. The only one that I can't seem to find is The Abominable Snowman (i believe that is the right name). Other than that he is very happy and so am I.",1393372800,2,825,3.940119760479042

8115789,3,B000EXZKRG,"IMO this collection is far better than Volume 1 though its still disappointing that it only contains four episodes of this Hanna Barbera Saturday morning classic.  It contains more science fiction elements over the pure fantasy elements of Vol. 1.  Consider the great episode The Colossus Of Atlantis wherein the Calico crew gets embroiled in a time travel travesty and tries to survive a gigantic mechanical sentry.  That was a fun one.  Two of this discs episodes have Godzilla and crew fight a monster that can turn itself invisible/ cloak itself.  The Horror Of Forgotten Island is likely a favorite of any Harryhausen The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad fan as it pits Godzi against a crabbish cyclops who has to deal with a force field (this makes me recall the scene in Voyage where the genie erects a force field blocking the cyclops.  The Seaweed Monster might have been an inspiration for Godzilla Vs. Biollante, and the concept of cutting off a part of a beastie, like the head of a hydra, only to watch it grow into more monsters is always an entertaining spectacle.

While I thoroughly enjoy my Godzi and I can tolerate the outlandish eyeball laser beams and all this series shows its age.  But I have enjoyed watching it again and passing it along to my son.",1458086400,,1265,4.6923076923076925
