8001845,5,B0000E32WU,One of the Best seasons of Making the Band. This season is classic.,1407456000,,67,4.230769230769231
8001846,2,B0000E32WU,"I'm pissed! I thought it was gonna show the whole episode series, not just clips here and there of episodes....not only that, majority of this shows puffy doing his vacation and concerts and I didn't pay to see him! It's only a 96min video and I was very disappointed! It left out all the good parts, fights, confrontations....hell, even the cheesecake run..lol....waiste of my money, wish I could return it but can't now that I opened it. DVD arrived very fast tho, that's my only positive point.,.",1394582400,7,499,4.747126436781609
8001847,2,B0000E32WU,"I am a HUGE fan of this season.  The DVD, however, fails to show the best scenes. It follows the cast from the beginning try outs but ends before all of the drama really started. None of the fights are included on this DVD, it doesn't include the recording sessions. I was very disappointed because it's marketed as if it includes the entire season.",1239148800,11,349,4.453125
8001848,3,B0000E32WU,"It was good,but making the band 4 is even better. but they cut two very good people that should have stayed: Makio, and Carlos.",1186876800,,127,4.333333333333333
8001849,5,B0000E32WU,"I always admire them for the way they achieve even tho I'm their biggest fan. It's sad that they disband 'cuz of a lack of knowledge and support, y'know. But they'll try hard next time.

I believe that they'll still live on to the fullest. As for Babs, Young City (aka Choppa), and Ness still stayed for Bad Boy except those that left and didn't nothing against them Dylan (the reggae rapper), Sara (the love singer and the 1st singer on the group), and uhhh...let's see...Fred I forgot (he was always ignorant like Choppa for example).

Ok to make this short, I believe that they'll gon start over unless they gon do something about it. When I watched the entire show, it's was crazy and very important to me. Yes there were a lotta fights goin on, messing around, cussing, fooling around, playing games and of that little stuff they're doin.

One thing I like about Ness is that he isn't afraid to show his testimony to the group so now he's off his own putting a new release which 'bout to hit real soon.

And for others included, I never forgot, but I know who u are for example.

Look forward for seasons 2 and 3 comin out on DVD and check out season 4 comin' out on MTV which gon be a girl group this time on Making the Band 3.",1109376000,3,1233,4.274678111587983
8001850,5,B0000E32WU,"I Don't own this but I loved the show and hope they release this on VHS b/c I don't own a DVD player. Making The Band 2 had some extremely talented people and was entertaining in other aspects as well. I hope they release the other seasons, though this is unlikely since Da Band is no more.",1094083200,4,290,4.105263157894737
