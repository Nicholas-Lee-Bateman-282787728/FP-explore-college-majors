2702294,5,B000LC4WP6,"Man did we ever wait forever for this to come out. If you are a Steelheart fan and never got the chance to see them live,this will fullfil your loss of never seeing this great band and phenominal singer live. And those of us who got to see them live,it will only spark the memories of seeing Mili nail note after note and all the ""big haired rock chicks"" we all crushed on. Unless you're a female then ""all the long haired guys"". There covered my bases.

The live Tokyo show starts this dvd and does not disappoint.

The videos are great, and the acoustic shows are even better.

There is a video of Mike and a piano singing ""Mama Don't You Cry"". Absolutely incredible!

But what really made this dvd for me was the backstage footage and the camera guy walking through the crowd before the concert. I laughed and I also just went back in time 17 years and relived all those great memories over.

You will not be disappointed in this if you are a Steelheart fan or a fan of that music from that special moment in time.",1177286400,6,1017,4.276041666666667
2702295,5,B000LC4WP6,This DVD has been a long time coming.  Thank God it finally arrived - and TWO DVDs to boot!  Great footage and sound.  Love the 5 videos from MTV.  A must have for any true rock music fan.,1173139200,,188,3.8684210526315788
2702296,4,B000LC4WP6,"I just bought this from Amazon recently, and I had to return it and get a replacement. The reason? The first DVD skips a lot during the song ""Never Let You Go"". Amazon sent the second DVD promptly, but it still has the same problem. It looks as if it is a defect from the factory. I decided to keep it since there is nothing else you could buy on Steelheart out there on DVD. Great band from the 80's, highly underrated, HUGE singer. It is a pity they were ""killed"" by the ""Seatle Grunge"".",1169337600,5,489,4.157894736842105

Who could ask for more?  If you have never heard of Steelheart, Then this is a perfect introduction to an amazing talent. If you are a fan, it is a satisfying indulgence.

8160970,5,B000LC4WP6,"Steelheart's ""Still Hard"" is a fantastic double DVD set with over 3 1/2 hours of pure hard rocking Steelheart. It is an incredible collection of Steelheart in their prime! I love having their music videos, two live concerts, and all the behind the scenes stuff in this double DVD set.

The first disc includes a concert from their 1990 tour of Japan. I had the fortunate experience of seeing and meeting them in Japan back in 1990 during this tour. This was their first series of live shows to promote their self titled CD. I remember at the time just how amazing they were in concert. I'd always hoped to have a video of a concert from this tour and now I have it on DVD. Very cool! The rest of the first disc includes a few live acoustic performances of the band (the piano & vocal ""Mama Don't You Cry"" is amazing!) along with 6 of their music videos: ""I'll Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Stop Me Lovin' You"", ""She's Gone"", ""Everybody Loves Eileen"", ""Sticky Side Up"", and ""Wait"".

The second disc includes a 1991 concert in the US. It also includes TV appearances, interviews, and a lot of behind the scenes footage like the making of their second album ""Tangled In Reins"" with a bunch of studio footage, live video of the band before Steelheart (called ""Red Alert""), and footage from the accident in Denver when a lighting truss fell on vocalist Mike Matijevic.

Steelheart has always been one of my favorite hard rock bands of the early 90s. I was very excited to get my hands on this double DVD set. I recommend this DVD to any hard rock, hair metal fans even if you aren't familiar with Steelheart's music. Their live concerts and videos are everything an 80s and/or early 90s hard rock / hair metal band should be. And they rock live. You won't be disappointed!!!",1288828800,2,1765,4.492211838006231
8160971,4,B000LC4WP6,"This video is a long time coming, and SteelHeart is great the vocalist was thought my many to have studio magic do his singing for him but guess what on this video proves all them skeptics wrong, the man can sing and hit the highest of notes kinda like a freak of nature, for those who never got the chance to see SteelHeart live, get this video.",1211846400,2,346,4.17910447761194
8160972,5,B000LC4WP6,"If you are a fan of Steelheart you must buy this great DVD it has everything you need live, concert footage film clips etc. Over 3 hours of great music plus bonus footage of the band in studio + interviews. This is how all music DVDs should be like. Brillant Stuff.",1209772800,,265,4.215686274509804
8160973,5,B000LC4WP6,For all of us that have come late to Steelheart this is what you need to buy to see what an awesome band they are. The footage from there video clips is worth the price alone but to get live footage and interviews is a great bonus. So spend your hard earned cash its well worth the investment and if you get Steelheart coming your way in the future get out and see them.,1194566400,2,370,4.013513513513513
8160974,5,B000LC4WP6,"I just bought this DVD for the video's, which are great. Plus I heard some of their songs I never heard before so I'll be getting that cd also.
But all in all it's great. It is worth buying for all Steelheart fan's. You will not be disappointed. Highly recomended!
I also want to add that all the extra's are great. I love watching this DVD. To watch the video's brings back memories. I can still remember the day when I first seen them on MTV. It's just a great DVD for anyone who was a fan or still is a fan of Steelheart.
My favorite's on the DVD are the music video's, the interviews and the unplugged. The live shows are great also.",1189641600,2,637,4.145161290322581
8160975,5,B000LC4WP6,"this is the only dvd from steelheart i know of. I saw them once after their second album. They were the best. This dvd is worth every penny. they were an awsome band until his accident. his music is not the same now but if you loved them then, then you've gotta' have this.",1182902400,4,273,4.074074074074074
