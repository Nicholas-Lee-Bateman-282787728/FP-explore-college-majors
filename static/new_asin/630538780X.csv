7891605,5,630538780X,"This was a great volume of ""That Girl"" episodes, featuring some of the best episodes of the 1966-1971 ABC sitcom.
In ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"" (1966), Ann and Donald meet when they both want the same desk at a store. After many a tense run in, they finally hook up. Marlo Thomas speaks at the end of this episode, encouraging the audience of '66 to 'watch That Girl in color....or black and white..just watch it!'
In ""Anatomy of a Blunder"" (1966), Don and Ann go on a picnic before they visit Ann's parents. Don lands (literally) in one mess or another, and by the time they arrive, Ann's parents almost think he's a bum.
In ""Counter Prosal"" (1970), the first episode of the last season, and the first episode to feature the now famous 'Diamonds, Daises,Snowflakes' theme. Donald proposes to Ann in this episode, and many misunderstanding about their engagement ring occur.",1009238400,2,886,4.759740259740259
