8678273,4,B001DNBX0O,"Short and succinct, it likely helps to have lived at the time of the filming.  Roughly the first half of the clip is, frankly, corny, but necessarily so.  It shows a prepubescent who is still innocent and naive, in an era that stressed conformity.  The latter half of the clip shows her developing resolve after being shunned for wearing a simple bracelet with Jewish symbols.  The ending is rather ambiguous, which I find remarkable for a film made at a time when moralistic loose ends were tied at the end of a story.

I tell my students that the young woman portrayed here in all likelihood went on a few years later to become a damned good hippy.",1294963200,,650,4.47457627118644
