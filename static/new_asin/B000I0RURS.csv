8142925,4,B000I0RURS,"I wasn't sure of buying Meenaxi in DVD because it's such a visual film, but the YRF transfer is pretty decent when played through a bluray player. Though the print has a few scratches here and there, it's more than a decent release. Plus, the near-30-min Making Of is more than worth it.

A bluray upgrade would be a rarity, so get it while you can.",1399420800,,349,4.287878787878788
