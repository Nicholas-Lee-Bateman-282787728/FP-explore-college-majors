5102916,5,B007P9HVSS,"My little is completely in love with Angelina and friends!  She is learning the great dancing moves from that Angelina and friends master.  She is also learning friendship, relationship with parents and siblings, helping each other and much much more.  It's a great story that I'd buy the completely series.  Keep up the great work!",1353628800,,332,4.9818181818181815
5102917,5,B007P9HVSS,"I think Angelina is totally to blame, in a good way, for the fact that AppleBlossom loves to twirl and dance and asks to be a ballerina. These episodes are full of friendship and music history, like the disco. Learning about confidence is so a great a powerful lesson and these mouse friends really cover it. Then again, perfect timing on birthday wishes for this little girl. Love it!

My apologies that this review was drafted and never posted, but never fear, this film is timeless and your ballerina will love it now just as when it was released in the summer!

5102919,5,B007P9HVSS,"I live in a house full of women, and they love Angelina. Some of this may be because they love dancing, but I think they also just love the story of Angelina. As a father these episodes as well as the character of Angelina are wonderful as the messages that she shares are definitely ones that I want my girls to learn. This DVD has a great mix of different episodes that you can choose from and my girls really enjoyed the bonus feature on this DVD too! Altogether I have to give this DVD two thumbs up, not only for content, but also for entertainment value, as my girls wanted to watch these episodes over and over and my guess is that yours will too!",1339027200,2,654,4.198412698412699
