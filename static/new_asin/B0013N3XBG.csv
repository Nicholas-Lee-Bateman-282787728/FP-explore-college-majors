8252317,3,B0013N3XBG,"This is the ""Donna"" DVD repackaged.

This appears to be the trend with Universal. Same product, same running order, no remastering or improvement of sound, just a bright new package with the ""previously released"" notice in very small print hidden somewhere on the back of the package.

I don't blame the artist. This DVD has some great rare clips and is a must for any fan of 10cc ONLY if you don't have the ""Donna"" DVD.

Now if they would only compile all the Godley & Creme videos (including ""Mondo Video"") in one collection I could die happy.",1242950400,3,545,4.540816326530612
