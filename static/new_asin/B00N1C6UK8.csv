8675561,4,B00N1C6UK8,"The KOH video series continues with its tradition of incredible cinematography, slow-motion closeups of compressing suspensions, tires deforming under the demands of big engines and multi-ton boulders and vehicle inversions and mid-air rolls. The tradition of paying homage to desert zen and esprit de corps is also continued, with many brief interviews with drivers before and after their events, and clips of intercom chatter among drivers and copilots during the race. The ethereal and the personal are equally attended to here.

Rather than a technical account of a motorsport, The Element Of Survival depicts the drama of the most difficult offroad race being taken on by real people. Jessi Combs' enthusiasm at becoming the first woman to win(the EMC) in KOH history was a pleasure to watch. The narration by Sam Williamson is top-notch ; delivered in an enthusiastic yet just-the-facts style, that provides a notion of the rules,stakes, terrain and vehicle issues faced by the racers, as well as a brief history of how IFS has been proven by KOH to be the best tradeoff between rock crawling and desert racing.

Why four stars ? While I realize a big part of the aim of KOH videos is to emphasize the passions and aspirations of the teams, and build excitement and support for the event while possibly putting a few ideas into the minds of future racers, I would appreciate more of Williamson's narration on subjects like an explanation, with maps and graphics, of the actual race route, and more of an overall account of what happened to all 140+ racers, and not just the top finishers. As a recreational Jeeper for the last thirty years, I have a little skin in the offroad game, and am therefore interested in lessons learned by these guys. There's a lot of drama in hopes and dreams, and maybe even more in dealing with having to put them on hold for another year.

There is coverage of the dirt bike and side-by-side (UTV) competitions, also, as well as the Every Man Challenge and Last Chance Qualifier runs. The extras consist of three 3-minute GoPro hood-top-views of qualifying runs by Erik Miller, Nick Nelson and Tom Wayes. The first seven minutes of the DVD are a cinematic overview of KOH put to the song ""Zero Sum"" by Our Wild America that is really appropriate to the subject matter, and gets you into the groove for the rest of this excellent one hour and twenty minute story about a certain week in February at Johnson Valley, California.",1409184000,3,2462,4.815602836879433
