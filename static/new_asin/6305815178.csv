1082232,2,6305815178,"If you're interest in this movie is based on Selma Blair, you'll probably be disappointed.  Not that Selma isn't great in her part as the seventeen year old ""play-thing"" of an extremely rich and perverse old man, but her part is small despite top billing.  If you're looking for skin, the best you're going to do is Selma in her pink undies.  Which may be worth it for some die-hard Selma fans.  As for the movie itself, if you're looking for a modern day ""L.A. Confidential"", this isn't it.  Though it is a ""whodunit"", I'm still not quite sure who did what and I'm not sure I really care.  Then again, my main interest was Selma, so I could be bias.",970531200,10,650,4.330578512396694
1082233,4,6305815178,"Jason Freeland's ""Brown's Requiem"" is proof that you don't need to spend 100 million dollars to make a great movie. ""Requiem"" is an adaptation of James Ellroy's first novel, and like the book it is high  on suspense and twists. The plot is typical Ellroy: an emotionally battered  man atones for past sins by involving himself in a labrythian mystery.  Michael Rooker, as Fritz Brown, gives a phenomenal performance filled with  subtlty and sly acting. The cast is filled with many great character actors  including Selma Blair, Brad Dourif, Valerie Perrine, and the late Brion  James. Freeland's script is exceptionally tight and is remarkably faithful  to the complex novel. Check this movie out!",955929600,14,698,5.123893805309734

Great quality DVD. The plot is solid, the acting superb, and the cast perfect. One of the great PI classics - a thriller right up there with The Big Sleep, Farewell My Lovely, and  The Long Goodbye.",1486339200,,371,4.3768115942028984

7895977,4,6305815178,"I missed James Ellroy's debut novel on which this film was based, but the adaptation has the same voiceprint as a number of his subsequent literary blockbusters. Anti-hero protagonist with some deep emotional scars. Sleazeball contacts on both sides of the scrimmage line. Conflict between the two strong enough to strike sparks. Complicated plot, involving cops, politics and the corrupt inner workings of either or both.

Fritz Brown/Michael Rooker is the lead here, dumped by the LAPD for a drinking problem and working now as a car repossessor and P.I. He's hired by concerned Freddie ""Fat Dog"" Baker/William Sasso to get the dirt on Sol Kupferman/Howard Gould, a shady fiftyish businessman his 17-year old sister Jane/Selma Blair has moved in with. Early on in the surveillance, whaddya know, he witnesses a suspicious exchange between Sol and Internal Affairs cop Haywood Cathcart/Brion James. Cathcart instigated Fritz's ouster from the force; he's not a dear friend.

From there, the plot starts to get complicated. I think I understood about half of it, the half that's explained (under extreme pressure from Fritz) by a third prominent bad guy. And I'm totally lost as to why a couple of prosperous creeps like Sol and Haywood would have been personally handling their transfers to start with. Or how after the routine 'drop the case' beating in which Fritz incurs a possible concussion and broken ribs, he appears to be fine 24 hours later.

But I'm probably thinking too hard. Those last two question marks might be examples of what critics refer to when suggesting to forget about plausible plot details, just relax and enjoy the action. Of which there is some on a small scale here, along with solid acting and a presentable script I'm guessing is pretty faithful to the Ellroy model. In a noir film you don't need much else.",1427760000,,1839,4.98371335504886
7895978,4,6305815178,"I saw this movie on Netflix; wading through many, many movies that no one wants to watch. However, as I'm a huge Michael Rooker fan I checked it out and LOVED it! Let's face it, he's made some bad movies but this is not one of them! There are a few other actors in the movie that take away from it a bit but he still manages to pull it together. Don't buy this movie because of Selma Blair - she's not in it enough to do so.",1387497600,,424,3.8295454545454546
7895979,4,6305815178,"The Bottom Line:

The modern-day equivalent of a Poverty Row feature, Brown's Requiem lacks high production values and frills but generates a lot out of a little and features Michael Rooker at his anti-social best; if you like neo-noirs or James Ellroy you should watch this underappreciated little film.",1233100800,,304,5.204081632653061
7895980,4,6305815178,"I didn't like how the story resolved itself in the end, but the cast and production were great. The dialogue was terrific. Amateurish or self-consciously neo noir? Perhaps, but it did a better job as an homage to that genre than ""Brick"" or ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang."" I didn't read the book so I am just judging the film on its own terms. I say it's worth two hours of your time and a few bucks.",1180656000,5,393,4.184210526315789
7895981,4,6305815178,A private detective is hired to free a duped young sister by a man that has ties to an illicit activity. The client also has ties to some illicit activity. A very good dramatic mystery. I had to watch it from start to finish.,1151452800,3,225,4.136363636363637
7895982,4,6305815178,"This film is a plain suspense story, though we know the bad ones from the very start. The suspense of the film comes from the slow discovery of the details of the crimes. An ex-cop, turned private investigator, gets into a case that leads him to a lot of money but also to a vengeance. The details are absolutely sordid, bleak, disgusting.

Some kind of group of criminals work with an important LAPD cop, the one who fired Fritz Brown, the hero, to embezzle a lot of welfare money into their pockets with fake welfare cases. One of their low rank associates, Fat Dog, burns one of their cover-up bars, steals their ledgers and a big chunk of that embezzled money. He is on the run and he hires the PI to look after his sister. He will eventually get killed.

But The ugliest part of it is that the 17 year old sister is the lover of the real boss of the little maffia ring. But it will be discovered that she is in fact his daughter. This last detail is what makes this story unbearable. The fact that the man is a Jew determines the break away attitude of Fat Dog. But the sister, when she finally knows the truth, decides to stick with her father-lover.

The PI will eventually get his vengeance against the LAPD cop-VIP, and his hands on Fat Dog's stolen money. But the vision of the world given here is absolutely sickening. I will yet regret the antisemitism that lurks behind the film that in part takes place in Venice, a place that is also known as the locale of American History X, another story about antisemitism and neo-nazi leagues. Fat Dog is on that line with Hitler's picture well positioned in his shack. We thus have the impression we are entering a world that is purely created by Hollywood and we do not know whether we are in the real world or not.

This gives the strange impression that we are living in a virtual world wirth Hollywood's productions and that this virtual world has a loose connection with the real world. But is it really the case ? We cannot know nor decide.

7895983,3,6305815178,"Uneven attempt to adapt James Ellroy's first novel.  Features an excellent cast --- William Sasso's portrayal of Fat Dog Baker is worth the price of admission --- but Michael Rooker in the starring role seems badly miscast for an Ellroy-style ""hero.""  Brown's relationships with Jane Baker and Walter are never developed; these characters appear only briefly so it's difficult to feel much emotional resonance (in the novel these relationships are crucial to Brown's motivations and why he acts as he does).  A worthwhile entertainment for hard-core mystery fans, but it does make one yearn for the depth and complexity of the novel.
Nothing special about the DVD.  The audio is two-channel Dolby and the transfer is letterboxed but not enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  Extra features are limited to a trailer and cast and crew bios, although there is an audio commentary by the director.",973123200,10,879,5.076388888888889
7895984,5,6305815178,"I loved the book and couldn't believe that the movie was even better.  I tend to be critical of first time directors, but I found very little to criticize.  Kudos to Freeland for a great performance.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste any more time.",971136000,10,255,4.382978723404255
