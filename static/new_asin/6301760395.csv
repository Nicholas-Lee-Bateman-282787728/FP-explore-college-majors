350921,3,6301760395,"There's only one thing that bugs me about this tape.  Bugs Bunny is SO lethargic compared to his performance in the old school cartoons.  It's like he was turned into a slow, uncrazy, less funny, Mickey-Mouse-type character.  That's not how he's supposed to be at all!

Thank goodness Yosemite Sam and Wile E. Coyote continue to remain great.  And Porky's stuttering is just what you'd expect.  I just wish Bugs wasn't so darn slow in this one.  He's less funny here than he was when playing the bad guy in the tortise and hare cartoons.",1157673600,,537,4.589473684210526
350922,4,6301760395,"When my family moved, we lost our beloved copy but I'm getting us a new one this Christmas. It's great to watch with any baby boomer or kids of all ages...anyone who can really appreciate Yosemite Sam's rendition of Scrooge. This is a really fun set...not nearly long enough, but so watchable you won't mind seeing it 50 times. :-)",1133827200,,331,4.533333333333333
350923,5,6301760395,"These cartoons are not only great Bugs Bunny cartoons, but they're great holiday cartoons as well, and certainly a far better collection than the other Looney Tunes holiday specials.  My mom taped this program off TV for me one Christmas when I was little, and I've watched them every year since.  My only fear is that my VHS tape will wear out.  I really hope that this collection is released on DVD soon - I would buy the DVD without even thinking about it!",1131840000,7,459,4.440476190476191
350924,4,6301760395,"If you're going to watch a Looney Tunes TV special (most of which [stink] compared to the true classics that inspired them) watch this. It's great! 3 all new cartoons: ""The Fright Before christmas"", in which Bugs Bunny and his nephew, Clyde, are awaiting Santa Claus, and end up with Taz instead. ""Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol"" is a good retelling of ""A Christmas Carol"", and ""Freeze Frame"" is a very funny Roadrunner cartoon. Arguably some of the best modern Looney Tunes.",990835200,9,473,4.851851851851852
350925,5,6301760395,"The late Friz Freleng does a great job with his retelling of ""A Christmas Carol"" with Porky as Bob Cratchitt, Bugs Bunny as the Ghost, and Yosemite Sam as Scrooge.  In another sequence, the Tasmanian Devil  plays Santa.  And of course, let's not forget Chuck Jones, who shows the  Coyote chasing the Road Runner in the snow (thanks to Wile E's Acme Snow  Maker, which he purchases since roadrunners don't like snow!).",962150400,5,417,4.736111111111111
7814634,5,6301760395,"This collection of cartoons includes one of my favorite versions of A Christmas Carol, titled Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol.  Starring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, it should not be confused with Bah, Humduck! which also features Bugs and Sam.  In Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol, Yosemite Sam stars as Scrooge, and Porky Pig as Bob Cratchit.  Bugs plays himself playing one ghost to scare Sam and influence him to become a better person.

This is a must see for any fan of Bugs Bunny and/or A Christmas Carol!",1478995200,,505,4.7701149425287355
7814635,5,6301760395,"In keeping with Christmas spirit, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises AND Chuck Jones Enterprises teamed up to bring us a half-hour Christmas classic from 1979 starring Bugs Bunny and a host of other Looney Tunes stars, in 3 exclusive shorts (all of which would be released in theatres in the 1980's as individual shorts). Yosemite Sam playing Scrooge, a wintry Road Runner chase, and Taz dressed as Santa (with Santa's own laundry), and exclusive bridging sequences that can only be seen here! It WAS on DVD in 2007, as a bonus program to volume 5 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, but it was NEVER given a DVD all by itself, nor has Bah Humduck been rereleased with this half-hour classic as a bonus feature, as of 2016. Like I keep saying, just be thankful for what you still have; with me, I have this special in volume 5 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection and no other way. ""Anyway, merry Christmas, gang. And happy N-n-n-n... happy holidays.""",1478304000,,948,4.751515151515152

7814637,5,6301760395,I remember seeing this Christmas Looney Tunes Special when I was a child and it's So Funny!!! Who cares how old we are because Funny Cartoons brings back so many memories and this one will. I'll be ready to enjoy this Funny Looney Tunes Christmas cartoon when they do Funny Stuff every year for Christmas including Christmas in July and in December!!!:) As an adult it will bring back so many funny memories when I was a child year after year.:),1441324800,,445,4.506172839506172

7814639,5,6301760395,This is really a fabulous Bugs Bunny and Looney Tune characters Christmas collection.  My favorite is Bug's Christmas Carol.  We had the video when my son was a toddler and it quickly became a Christmas season tradition until it was destroyed in a flood several years ago.  We hunted all over for a replacement and if we could find one the price was ridiculously high.  Finally fond one reasonably priced and it is once again a Christmas season tradition to view.  You absolutely will enjoy this collection of Three Looney Tune Christmas tales.  The only thing that would make it better would be to have it made available on disc.  Forget those who are pricing it ridiculously high based upon its popularity and look for an honest seller who is selling it for under $20.,1382832000,2,770,4.659259259259259
7814640,5,6301760395,"As a child, I waited patiently for this to come on and made sure to be extra good, so my parents would let me watch it. The first part of the special introduces children to Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with Yosemite Sam as Scrooge. Bugs takes on the job of Marley's Ghost, but being a children's special, it is devoid of scary moments. The second part has the roadrunner versus Wiley E. Coyote. This section has little to do with Christmas. The third section is a take off of the Twas the Night Before Christmas with the TAZ as Santa. My daughter loves when Taz eats Bugs' Christmas Tree Lights. The owners of the rights to these movies saw fit to release Bugs Bunny's Easter Special on a DVD, and Bugs Bunny Halloween Hijinks on DVD. It would be a nice X-MAS gift to release this on DVD and Blue Ray. How about it?",1379808000,3,814,4.292207792207792
