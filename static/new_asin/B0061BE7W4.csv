8490797,5,B0061BE7W4,"I don't know why the other reviewers put a 1 star for this even after they realized that it was their error for not knowing what ""Regions"" meant. Because it didn't play in your player, doesn't mean this doesn't get a 4 or 5 star. They should have rated the program itself, not the Region it's in (that is clearly marked). They admitted it was a good and funny show. I'm baffled by them giving a low rating, so don't let that deter you if you have a Region 2 player. It is very funny and entertaining.
If you don't have the correct player, you can view lots of these episodes on YouTube. Search for ""Walk on the Wild Side"" or even ""Funny talking animals BBC"".

One other reviewer quotes one of the animals yelling out ""Alan, Alan, Alan...."", this is one of my favorite bits, along with ""Nightime...Daytime"". Watch it and it will make sense to you. If you have a good sense of humor, you will find most of this funny.",1430697600,,915,4.289017341040463

Other than that, this is a GREAT, funny, clean video, and I hoped so much to have it for our grandkids to enjoy at Christmas..  Rats.",1418860800,,343,4.65
8490799,5,B0061BE7W4,"This show is hilarious, been watching on YouTube for months. Anyone that knows BBC, knows that the show is broadcast in PAL format, not a US format. Not fair to leave reviews for such a great show, due to buyer unfamiliarity.

Alan, alan, alan, al , al , al, (no, I think that's Steve) STEVE, STEVE, STEVE, STEVE, STEVEN, . . . LOL",1364169600,4,331,4.253968253968254
