4542321,1,B0053O8AAK,"The Office is a great show but these disks are absolutely horrid.  The first set I received, none would play back in three different Bluray players (LG, Sony, and PS4 Pro).  As always Amazon returns are amazing.  The replacement set has the same issue.  I've given up at this point and it's a shame that I won't be able to own season 8 in HD (I already have the DVD box set and they are fine).  Buyer beware!  I've had no problems with seasons 5, 6, 7, and 9 Bluray sets.",1504483200,,471,4.1208791208791204

4542388,2,B0053O8AAK,"Probably the weakest season of the series. Let's be honest: it's just not the Office without Michael Scott, and you really feel it with each episode (and you really want him back.) Andy Bernard sort of works as a manager, and yet the same appeal just isn't there. His relationship with Erin just seems shallow and forced. The humor also seems to get noticeably more mature this season, which is really a shame. The end is getting near with the series and you can tell it here.",1494547200,,476,4.482758620689655
4542389,1,B0053O8AAK,"Like a fool I ignored all the negative comments regarding the skipping and freezing issues with these dual-layer Blu-ray discs. Complaints go back as far as 2012, so I assumed the problem had been fixed by now. Wrong. Both sides of every disc (Blu-ray and DVD) started skipping or froze at random intervals, rendering most episodes unwatchable. I tried playing them on three different players, all with the same result. Why can't Universal release a Blu-ray only edition like they have done for every other season. I have no problem with those. Amazon should stop selling this defective Blu-ray set immediately until the issue is fixed.",1494115200,,636,5.009433962264151
4542390,5,B0053O8AAK,"Best comedy show of my generation, I have watched the entire show many times. My Only complaint is that the season 8 Blue Ray DVD combo is a double sided disc set. Meaning to artwork on the discs, one side is Blue Ray the other DVD. so stupid, I hate Double Sided discs with a passion. I thought they had gone out of style 10 years ago but apparently not. If you really want this set I would say get either the DVD or the Blue ray set, not the combo pack.",1493683200,,455,3.9565217391304346

Robert California borders on reprehensible in an alienating way, and Andy is a terrible boss in most ways (and Ed Helms is a boring actor).  Also, the discs themselves had a difficult time playing in my machine, which was strange.  They are that hybrid blu-ray / DVD single disc that some things use.",1459036800,,352,4.555555555555555

4542553,5,B0053O8AAK,"I personally believe you have to be invested in the supporting characters to give this season 5 stars, because without Michael Scott they really get a chance to shine, especially characters like Kevin and Andy. I happen to think the left/right episode that starts off the season was brilliant and touching! Also Dwight's take on the left right lineup made me laugh out loud! I loved the Florida trip and Dwight and Jim even though adversaries coming to the rescue for each other time and again. I liked Nellie but I didn't like what she pulled off toward the end of the season, that was entirely implausible but it did lead to one of the best tantrum moments of the whole series. To put it bluntly the Office Season 8 was still funnier than anything else made that year.",1456099200,3,770,4.546762589928058

4542654,3,B0053O8AAK,"With such a tall order to fill after Michael's character left, this season struggled to fit the bill.  After a repugnant start with some of the worst written episodes in the series' entire run, it gradually picks up to being at least entertaining (though not on par with seasons 1-7 or 9) before ending off on another sour note with the last episode.  Overall, it seems a drastic change in writing occurred that struggled to make a show without Michael.  This wouldn't have been terribly hard except that the change in writing translated into some of the characters altering into very awkward renditions of their previous selves, which finally seemed to wear off about halfway through, at least partially.",1437436800,2,705,4.907563025210084
4542655,3,B0053O8AAK,"Although I am a huge Office fan, I have to say this is the worst season of all nine. Even though Michael Scott is gone, the ""humor"" of Robert California doesn't translate to dry comedy lovers.

4542660,1,B0053O8AAK,"The series was never the same after Steve Carrel left, but put that aside and look at the quality control of the physical copies. I bought this to completely my collection of the series (up to this point) and when I popped in the first disc, my Blu-ray player wouldn't read it. The reason? Universal decided to go double-sided with Blu-ray/DVD combo discs. Many double-sided discs have playback issues, so be aware before you buy this version. I must own the Blu-ray since it's available, but this is the only configuration of S8 for Blu-ray. If you don't care about formats, I'd suggest going with the DVD only option as they are single-sided and shouldn't have playback issues.",1432252800,,679,4.762711864406779

Neither my PS3, nor my Panasonic recognize the Blu-Ray side of the disks.  The PS3 struggles to play the DVD side, but then starts freezing and pixilating - if it plays at all.  I had more success with the Panasonic playing the DVD side, but eventually the same issues occur.  I am returning both sets and will purchase the DVD set.

Given the mixed reviews on this season, I ratherly enjoyed it, the show that is.  I'm not going to go into review of the show but the terrible lack of quality in this collection.

Secondly, avoid this collection like the plague! I know this series has had a bunch of screw ups with the packaging and disc layouts and vendors.  This collection blew all of them out of the water. Whoever is in charge of packaging must have crap for brains!

This collection is BLU-RAY on one side & DVD on the other.  First mistake, all I want is BLU-RAY, now this set is bloated with 5 discs and is different from seasons 5 to 7 & 9 Blu-ray.  Given the pure stupidity of these discs they are not printed on top like the other seasons and are more prone to scratching via shipping and also mishandling of the discs.

I returned this product because 3 out of 5 discs (blu-ray) were not even recognized from my blu-ray player (PS3) I actually managed to start the first episode but was rudely interrupted with constant freezing throughout the episode.

This set is lacking quality and completely unacceptable! Whoever released this dropped the ball hugely! They should've released this set just like the others, separate on blu-ray & DVD. Until they re-release this set I will never purchase this again!

DON'T BUY THIS SET AT ALL COSTS!",1393286400,4,1437,4.534883720930233

I only had up to season 5 and for the price it was worth completing the collection.  That being said, the latter half of the run isn't horrible. I can't seem to pinpoint the moment the show ""jumped the shark"", it just seems like at some point they just found a spot that had a ton of sharks circling the waters and just hung out there and tried to jump all of them. I really feel like the series finale was one of the best and successfully brought closure to the characters and the show as a whole.

They found their direction and made the final season great again, and It's still better than a lot of shows on TV, but compared to every other season this one just doesn't hold its own.

4543049,4,B0053O8AAK,"It took a long time, but I finally watched it. After all these years, I finally decided it was time to watch this show again and finish it. I stopped watching it because I knew Steve Carell left the show, and heard this show wasn't as good anymore.

But now, I got some extra time and decided to finishing seeing Season 8 and 9 and let this series end for me. Well, I thought season 8, wasn't that bad, in fact, it was good! It wasn't great or excellent because I felt that something was missing. It didn't take me hold and kept me there as it used to. I know Micheal isn't there anymore, but that wasn't it. The series has gone down since the Jim and Pam thing is pretty much died. They're married and have a child, wait make that a child and half. She pregnant and that wasn't really a story that I cared for. Jim has a slight spark interest beside Pam since she left and she give her job to a temp, but Jim was very slight interest in the temp, but clearly he didn't want to do anything with her and I thought that would had made a good story line I could had liked.

Other things that happened this season was that Andy became the main character of the story because he is now the manager and the CEO is Robert California. The whole season is about them fighting and working together. Some more things would be that Erin still loves Andy but Andy has another girlfriend, but still likes/loves Aaron as well. That was probably the most interesting thing I liked this season. I didn't really care about the story with Darryl and Val. Dwright wasn't as funny this seaon and the rest of the cast just were there, and weren't that big of a deal anymore.

Also, this series introduces Nellie Bertram, the Special Projects Manager. Her story was the second favorite this season. I found her character was quite funny and love how sexy she is. Even though she kind of old, she was she still HOT. lol

All in all, I liked the season. It started out really slow, but as the season continued on, it grew on me. I no longer looked to see if Michael would somehow walked in and say I'm back, but looked to see what would happen next with Andy and Erin. Towards the end, I would wait to see if Nellie would stay on as a permanent cast member. So, to sum it all, I would recommend finishing this show, even if Steve Carell isn't on it anymore.",1386979200,2,2332,4.221973094170403

Despite having region free blu ray and DVD players, both sides of some of the discs either refuse to load altogether or end up skipping and freezing during playback. This had happened on discs 1, 3 and 4. There is nothing visibly wrong with the discs so I cannot understand what the problem is, but I am seriously considering returning them and asking for a refund.

Overall, I think the series has survived well without Michael, and look forward to seeing Series 9 when it eventually gets released here. No more import taxes for dodgy discs for me.",1372723200,2,803,4.418918918918919

4543101,4,B0053O8AAK,"I have been a huge fan of THE OFFICE ever since its first season. And, up to and including the very last episode, I am glad I did. The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.

The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.

The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.

Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.

Purists and snobs will try to argue that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-precursor-British-Series/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the precursor British Series</a>&nbsp;was better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!

The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE. No spoilers but I will just state that the show does not disappoint to the very end.

Now, how many reams of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunder-Mifflin-Premium-acid-free-paper/dp/B006CDW35O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunder Mifflin Premium acid-free paper</a>&nbsp;should I you down for?",1372550400,,3433,5.527619047619048

Of course there were always a few laugh out loud moments, but even with Steve Carell being gone, there should have been enough back story and continuing story to make the show a success.  Biggest mistake was making Andy the manager.  His character just wasn't suited for that part.  Also, in my opinion Nellie and Robert California were disasterous mistakes.

I actually only reviewed this item because unlike every previous season, the Season 8 DVD set is lacking episode commentaries. This is perhaps the most valuable piece of bonus feature and its missing. You can always find blooper reels and deleted scenes for free online but getting episode commentaries is exclusive to the DVD. The earlier seasons actually had the stars of the show coming in to comment episodes but they have since become increasingly famous and busy so they don't comment on more recent season's DVD sets. However, Season 8 has no commentaries at all, not even from directors/writers. This lack of effort severely diminishes the value of this DVD set. I only purchased Season 8 because I'm a diehard The Office fan and I like to be complete but this is a major oversight.",1366934400,2,1022,4.554347826086956

All the characters are lovable and I love that they get to be part of the show so much more! Michael Scott leaving actually gave the show some elbow room for character development and story line. I only gave this 4 stars because there weren't any commentaries and I love those.

4543206,4,B0053O8AAK,"I went for this season fully knowing that things would not be the same without Michael Scott/Carell, but I also knew that the show is called ""The Office"" and not something like ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"". It is based on a strong ensemble cast. No doubt Carell was the star of the show, but I thought it could survive reasonably well without him. So, since I enjoy the show a lot, I bought it without thinking twice.

But I was wrong. The season really struggled in the first episodes. It was not only the absence of Carell, but it seemed to me that show running also changed, whoever was in charge did not ge the feel and essence of the show (of course, these are tottaly subjecitve topics). Some of the difficulty, I think, was due to the fact that Andy Bernard is not Michael Scote, that meaning: he is not insane. The really insane characters at the Office are Michael Scott (dellusional, no limits about being ridiculous, etc), Creed (no comments) and Dwight. The other people are not crazy. They all have their idiossincrasies, but are not in the level of madness of the character I mentioned before. So, one could not try to make Bernard goes suddenly crazy.

But, to my surprise, when I was struggling to the episodes, I think things really found their way after (and including) the DOOMSDAY episode, about the ""Accountability Booster"" (according to Dwight). And, yes, the rest of the ensemble had a little bit more screen time (except for Creed - his screen time even dwindled!). There is the introduction of a female character in the wharehouse, to act as love interest to

James Spader's Robert California is awful. Spader made the character so obnoxious and aloof and one-dimensional and aloof. No wonder he was gone after this sesason.

Some people disliked the Nellis character, but I found her very funny indeed.",1356307200,2,1818,4.689655172413793

I really enjoyed the new branch manager Will Ferrell I think he could have filled Micheal's shoes, unfortunately he gets hurt in one of the episodes and is suddenly off the show.

I think Season Eight is witty and original.  Andy is even less abnoxious than Micheal and also cares a lot about his employees.  I highly recommend it!!",1355961600,,588,4.660194174757281

4543266,4,B0053O8AAK,"I starting watching the show in 2005 and Seasons 2-4 are amongst the most hilarious TV moments ever (IMHO). Who would not want their own office to be a social comic freak show like that anyways.
While Season 7 was still a little bit reminiscent of how it all began, Season 8 's focus is more on Andy and his attempt to deal with the typical everyday office mayhem. The rest of the characters is still strong and I liked the old time suspense of some episodes, story lines arching over but still not like the earlier seasons. All in all the feel of it all did meet my expectations in terms of crude jokes, punchlines below the waistline at times and some silly character moments included. The mock interview sections are at a bare minimum - my real favorite moments. The mockumentary style is almost gone though.

4543342,2,B0053O8AAK,"You know, I hate to be that guy who points out that Steve Carell leaving the show was  what killed it. And in some ways, this isn't even accurate. While Michael Scott was a driving force behind The Office, the show COULD survive without him. It's just too bad the writers and producers never really figured out how.

This entire season was one big clusterf--k of 'What the hell is going on?' So, without any on-camera buildup or true explanation, Andy becomes the new boss and replaces Michael Scott. Now, it seems to me, the creators of the show should know how their own show is scuccessful. Especially if you're going to replace the STAR of a show. (This is the case, even if the star is no one that important, such as Topher Grace leaving ""That 70's Show""; it still went downhill from there). As much as Ed Helms' character of Andy Bernard is so much more likable than he used to be, the key to a successful Dunder Mifflin boss is that you can't really respect them. Or think that they could really be a regional manager in real life. Andy fails with this as he IS smart enough and restrained enough to be a real life boss. Granted, not of a company the size of Dunder Mifflin(/Sabre), but Ed Helms' character is still too believable to fit this role, here. Which results in BORING episodes. Stuff, where they literally had to find something for them to do. Like Andy getting a tattoo to win his co-workers respect. ...What was this? The fact that writers were so lost even BEFORE the season began is not a good sign.

Oh, and let's talk about the Black Hole of comedy that is James Spader. I mean, don't get me wrong. Spader is good when he has his moments, like in Boston Legal. But just like Nic Cage, basically, James Spader only ever plays himself. Only, as Robert California, he now plays himself saying weird and inappropriate sexual things. I also assume the writers couldn't balance his Crazy/Genius act for too long and just decided to make him an Eccentric Con Artist and master manipulator rather than a barely sane Mad Scientist/SuperGenius. But the point is, James Spader in The Office makes about as much sense as Rainn Wilson playing a new forensics expert in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. ...Wait. No. I take that back. Rainn Wilson  actually has the acting range (and believable nerd-isms) to pull that off. James Spader just doesn't fit in The Office as much as James Spader doesn't fit in ANY comedy, anywhere. What's worse is, his highly unlikable character whose only redeemable quality is that he's too confusing to fully dislike. Robert California scams influential people and knows much less than his air of confidence exudes. Regardless of all of this though, he's just simply NOT FUNNY.

Okay, so halfway through this entire mess, things start to slightly show a glimmer of hope with the Sabre Store arc, which brings back Nellie Bertram, played by Catherine Tate. The arc itself shows promise, but the writers drop the ball on this one, pretty much only getting Stanley's ""wild Florida persona"" right. But they also introduce a very confusing storyline where adorable Erin decides to stay in Florida in order to run away from her feelings with Andy, and Andy abandons his job to go chase her, despite not knowing what's going on with her. Before all this, though, we have the return of Todd Packer (who was great years ago, but his character is long past his prime at this point) who establishes a rivalry with Dwight in who will head the Sabre Store project. A lame storyline that's only trumped by a super-weak attempt to introduce a seductress into Jim's life, and try to throw a wrench in his happy marriage. Of course, the whole Cathy Simms plot was so rushed and poorly done, it might as well have never even been attempted. Eventually, Jim saves Dwight from heading the Sabre Store project, which was all a scam and destined to fail anyway, and Packer becomes the scapegoat and gets fired for it. Now, all of this could've worked if they had 1) Not made such a chaotic mess with it all and 2) not treated the Scranton branch during all of this as an afterthought. Just a lot of stuff going on and not much of it with any value. The only important things here that happened is the Sabre Store arc was a waste of time (in-universe, and in real life) and Andy reveals his true feelings to Erin, despite already having a girlfriend... who we are never given any reason for her existence or reason for liking a goofball like Andy, despite her drull, real life personality.

So after this whole confusing, muddled Tallahassee mess, Andy, while shirking his manager responsibilities to get Erin back, loses his job in an elaborate coup perpetrated by Nellie Bertram (who avoided going down with the Sabre Store disaster). And so NOW, after an entire Summer and much of the end of last season, the writers STILL don't know who should be manager!

[* In my opinion, bringing Melora Hardin back as Jan would've worked out best, as she's an already established character, has been proven to be funny, and would have no bad blood with the company since it's Sabre now, but I digress.]

Now, Nellie Bertram is manager. And although many will be mixed on this, I feel she actually WORKED in the role! Just like Michael, Nellie is barely competent, highly appropriate, and would never be a believable regional manager in real life. It seems like the spark is back and the potential for comedy on The Office has returned, only the writers never know what to do with Nellie! And after more confusion, she eventually loses her job again to Andy, after he hits rock bottom, gets fired by California, and does some 'soul searching' to grow a spine, man-up, and take back what's his. This leads into the Season Finale, where Andy Buckley returns as David Wallace, who inexplicably gets rich again, and is able to orchestrate a buyout of Dunder Mifflin with major help from Andy. Nellie is de-throned (which personally, I feel was a horrible choice and makes the writers look even more like they're as confused as a bunch of headless chickens, as Jo Bennett might possibly say.) This supposedly sets up the return of the ""old"" Sabreless Dunder-Mifflin for Season 9, only most of this never comes to fruition and David Wallace, as well as the pre-Sabre Dunder-Mifflin, never really return.

And what did Pam and Jim even do this entire season? I'm pretty sure it must've been something, but the fact it can't even be easily remembered just says enough about their characters, at this point in the series. I'm petty sure they just had another baby and that's it. The only character who had any kind of decent potential storyline this entire season was Dwight, possibly knocking up a now-engaged Angela. Only, the whole Dwight/Angela romance seems so dated and ""been there, done that"" now. It's really boring, at this point.

[* Not to play writer myself, but what ever happened to the amazonian dentist friend of Pam, Isabel Poreba? It would've made more sense for her to be happily in a relationship with Dwight, and Angela, having falling out of love with ""The Senator,"" engages in an affair with Dwight, which is very much in line with her hypocritical character, gets pregnant. Dwight could've argued Isabel is ""bad in bed"" or ""not as petit and dainty"" as Angela or something like that, and it would've better set up the whole Baby Daddy Mystery storyline. But you're not here to hear my What If's. Just saying, that would've made more sense and worked better, IMO. It also would've gotten rid of the need for Cathy Simms' stupid Mistress storyline with Jim.]

I've been a big Office fan since it's initial run in 2005 and own every season on DVD. However, this will be the first one I won't own. This season was so terrible, it needs to be de-canonized. As in, no one ever mentions anything that occured in this season, ever. Just a big, giant confusing mess for the writers and stupid storyline after the other. Again, I don't think Steve Carell's absence is a major factor in why this season sucked so badly, but it sure seemed to trip up the writers pretty badly. Not to mention, 2013's Season 9 (which again, introduces two annoying, very unlikable characters no one asked for, just when we finally get rid of Gabe Lewis) so far doesn't seem to be much better. While seeing the show end before we get sick of it would've left us wanting more, I'd much rather have the show end on top than slump into embarassment like Season 8. ""Seinfeld"" was able to go out on top. It's just too bad ""The Office"" won't.",1351036800,2,8532,4.625082508250825

The story line is engaging and there are many twists and turns that kept me interested. Actually can't wait for season 9. I'm glad they kept the show going. I was expecting it to be terrible from some of these reviews but it was hardly the case when I actually watched it. My husband and I both still love it!

4543347,4,B0053O8AAK,"The Office remains hilarious even after the departure of Michael Scott. Granted the first 2-3 episodes are a bit rough as the writers find their footing under the new management in Scranton, but gain momentum as the season progresses. Putting Andy in charge was an excellent decision as he shares many characteristics that Michael possessed, enabling the same tensions that made previous seasons so enjoyable to bubble to the surface. The biggest mistake in my mind is that they chose to undermine his leadership with James Spader's character, who is perplexingly unfunny and unlikable throughout, and who fails to develop any chemistry with the rest of the cast. Withdrawing the giant shadow cast by Michael Scott might have been an opportunity to shine the spotlight on some of the other established characters we have come to love, however too often we are made to suffer the inane contrivances of Robert California. Indeed the best episodes are those in which Andy is given the helm and is able to establish rapport with the ensemble cast in his new role.

Bottom line: If you enjoyed previous outings, you are likely to find enough here to be worth your while, although I cannot say it quite holds up to previous seasons.",1349913600,3,1226,4.894230769230769

I will admit, the finale was bizarre and seemed unrealistic. It seemed out of character for Andy to go to such lengths to build up his secret that he bought out Sabre to rub it in Robert California's face so bad. Was it just me?

4543365,2,B0053O8AAK,"(The following is a review of season eight of the Office, and not of the quality of the DVD release)

Continuity in the characters...gone.

Respect for the characters and their realistic (everyone knows someone like this) quirks....gone.

Department heads for Dunder Miflin/Sabre...apparently gone since to manage the office you only need sit in the managers' chair...

Others have stated the problems with this season, and I simply cannot write better or hone in more precisely on the issues with this season than they already have.

The abilities of the actors are not disputed here...they simply were not able to continue in their already well-developed characters, and I can't blame such a talented cast for having to execute the whims of writing that was often out of character and shameless. Even the brilliance of Catherine Tate could not save the episodes scattered here and there with her presence.

 In a nutshell, this season of the office is sadly just another example of a once smart sitcom that touched upon real-life people and situations we could all relate to,  hit head-on with a massive sledge-hammer of careless writing and juvenile antics, knocking the personality and wit so far out of this season  that it's barely suited for a  circus freak show.

I can only hope that season 9 will find some way to redeem the office and let it leave us with the fondness with which it arrived.",1348531200,4,1402,4.898305084745763
4543366,1,B0053O8AAK,"Wow, in this past season of the Office, the show's quality fell straight off a cliff.

I'm fine with Michael leaving, there was plenty of comedic talent among the cast to make it an enjoyable show without him, but the writing was super lazy and no one seemed to have any idea where anything was going.  This was most manifest in the two new characters they brought aboard. (SPOILERS ahead, for all who care)

James Spader as Robert California started out (in the season 7 finale) as a character that seemed to be either a genius or a con-man making it up as he went along.  Throughout all of Season 8, it seemed like the writers never figured out for themselves what they wanted him to be.  One episode he's a drunk screwing everything up.  The next he's 3 steps ahead of everyone else.  Ultimately he was both as he managed to run the company into the ground and yet convince David Wallace to give him a million dollars severance to go abroad Europe ""training"" teenage gymnasts in what had to be one of the dumbest character moments the show has ever had (I mean, really? David Wallace can't see through Robert's BS, but the entire office INCLUDING KEVIN can????  And they say NOTHING????).

Catherine Tate as Nellie.  Plenty of fans hated her, and its not hard to see why.  Personally, I think her character had potential, but again the writers didn't know who she was going to be.  She seemed confidant and together for the Sable store stuff, then admits to the camera in a later episode she doesn't have any idea what she's doing.  By the time she's in the main office she seemed like a new antagonist for Andy, but in some episodes they're trying to paint her sympathetically and give her relatable flaws (the memory box in the moving episode, the shopaholic stuff that Pam uncovers, the lame ""fish-out-of-water"" taco bit with Darryl) so is she supposed to be a character we hate or not?  The result was that most fans really didn't like her but I, for one, have no idea if that was the actual intention.

Some plot threads were introduced just to be dropped without much development.  Angela's baby, her possibly gay husband, California's wife, Andy's new girlfriend, that one lady trying to get Jim to sleep with her, etc. all seemed like they were going to be somewhat important only to surprise us by not getting much screen time after their introduction, with many things being wrapped up before they even have a chance to begin.  It was like the writers lit a series of firecrackers only to have every single one of them not go off.

Other plot points were just stupid, plain and simple.  I've already mentioned the boneheaded way California was sent off, but you can add Nellie getting Andy's job just by SITTING IN HIS CHAIR as the dumbest thing that's ever happened on this show.  That was compounded by Andy KEEPING HER ON STAFF at the end, despite her constant efforts to wreck him up til this point (again, including TAKING HIS JOB).  This show has already strayed pretty far from its realistic mockumentary roots, but this kinda stuff is so far beyond the realm of plausibility its honestly shocking the writers attempted to pass it off on a show like this.

There were other smaller issues too, but these major things, compounded by some unaddressed problems present in the last couple of years (Jim and Pam having nothing really to do now that they're married, Dwight's ever greater transformation to a living cartoon character) make this the worst year the Office has ever had.

If the one star rating seems a little harsh, let it be known that there were a few chuckle inducing moments (Kevin's disbelief that anyone would put a mummy in a museum was pretty great, and you can always count a few great Creed moments), and this is hardly the worst comedy on TV, but if the earlier seasons were 5 star, and the last couple of years were 3, I have no choice but to rate this season as a 1, it really was that bad in comparison to eveything that's come before it.

That said, I'll be watching season 9.  Not only is it the final season of the show (so I might as well stick around to see it off), the premiere last Thursday had two great meta moments (everyone throwing trash at Nellie being the highlight for me) that seemed to be the writers acknowledging they've made some mistakes in season 8 and they're gonna make it better.  Let's hope they do a better job with season 9.  Cause with season 8 behind them, there's no other place to go but up.",1348531200,35,4467,4.52363184079602

I reccomend buying the blu ray version even if u don't have a blu ray player because the discs have dvd on one side and blu ray on the other, just in case u ever get a blu ray player, and this version is $2 cheaper than regular dvd version for some reason.

Like most others, I knew it would be worse or even much worse without Michael, but Episode 1 was just plain bad, even worse than I imagined.  However, I hung in there, and after that things do pick up, as the plot really starts to develop.  Season 8 has a very good plot, just as good if not better than all the other seasons in my opinion.  It certainly is not nearly as funny as the first seven seasons (and not as good either), however, it is not nearly as bad as some people have made it out to be.  Sure, there are not any awkward Michael moments that make you cringe and close your eyes, but in their place, there is a really good plot.  There is a love story and some bonding between Jim and Dwight as the season progresses, and an overall enjoyable season.  Again, comparisons to the previous 7 seasons with Michael are inevitable, and yes, this season is not as good, but if you enjoyed the first 7, I see no reason why you should not enjoy the 8th.",1347926400,2,1077,4.169082125603865
4543381,4,B0053O8AAK,"I've seen a bunch of 1 star reviews. Sorry, but the shows wasn't that bad this season. Michael Scott is gone, but the rest of the cast was always strong with or without him. Yes, Jim and Pam aren't the fore front characters this season, and I find that refreshing. They were getting a bit annoying. I agree writers have murdered the plot by putting Andy as the boss. That made no sense, and we all know why they did it. Who cares? I liked seeing more of the nard dog this season. He always had spirit, and seeing him in a position to do a little something about it was nice.

Andy's character was always a fun one and his love triangle with Erin finally paid off a little this season. I don't follow the logic of those not liking that cause it was built up 3 seasons...Erm... How long did we wait for Jim and Pam's to finally pay off? The build up is half the fun and so are the awkward moments.

I think the rest of the cast carried the show just fine, and I believe that the addition of the new bosses Robert and Nelly (Who are insane) was a great addition. I still found the show fun (which is why i tune in). I agree it's lost it's steam. Aside from the Andy love story, not much was furthered in the overall plot. But hey...that's life in an office. Not everyone has everything going on all the time.

I even enjoyed angela this season which is a first for me. She seemed happier overall. However, They really need to get rid of gabe :) I'm glad we saw less of him this season... I find his character a waste of time.

One thing that's been true to the office for several season is the lacking plot lines. I don't expect some deep elaborite payoff in plot ever from this show. But I do expect good/awkward times. And this season delivers them.

I'm glad next season is the last and I'll re-watch it, cause the show is awesome. Hopefully they wrap things up in the emotional sense from fans. I don't expect any wrap up on plot.",1347753600,2,1931,4.18010752688172

It's also funny how they stated that there's lack of a plot, because I think it's the complete opposite! Ok, for the first 3 episodes, I can agree on that with lack of plot. I did NOT like the first 3 episodes, at all. Beyond that, all the episodes were great! Andy does a great job too, as well as the other characters. As for Robert California, he didn't bother me after a few episodes. However, there was one person who was definitely misplaced on this show, ""Nellie Bertram."" Her presence was horrible. But she was not on all of the episodes and didn't seem to ruin them.
Also, I loved Michael Scott on this show. But I can actually say, I didn't even notice he was gone!
Just the dynamic of the show changed, you can definitely feel it in this season. But after you watch the first few episodes, you will start to love it's change.

The first four seasons are the best, pure and simple.  Then, while there are moments in seasons 5-7, there were more moments--for me--where it was just too cringe inducing to handle.  I guess to put my money where my mouth is, I own seasons 1-4, and I plan on buying season 8, not sure what I'm going to do about seasons 5-7.  So, if you didn't watch this season because Michael/Steve was gone, you owe it to yourselves to watch this, based upon all us diehards, it looks like there is a 50% chance that you are going to really like the show.

Secondly, that new girl, Nelly I think, She was terrible. She was very hard to watch and was an absolutely horrible character,  and that's me being nice all right. She got Andy's job by just simply walking in and sitting down in his chair? How much are they paying these writers, well clearly not enough because they can't any who know how to actually write.
There were four good episodes of the season: ""The List"", ""The Incentive"", ""Doomsday"" and ""Pam's Replacement"". These four bring back memories of what the show used to be like.

However, sometimes it's time to pull the plug, and this is one of those times. The show currently airing that bears the title of The Office is a mere shadow of a show that used to air and also bore the title of The Office. These two shows have almost nothing in common with each other, excepting the fact that their characters share names and are played by the same actors.

To give some perspective to this review, let me give you a brief synopsis of my feelings on the other seasons of The Office: 2 & 3 - five stars; 1 & 4 - four stars; 5, 6, & 7 - three stars. I hold the opinion of the majority in that I like seasons two and three the most, but I'm also not too hard on the other seasons. That should tell you how much of a farce this eighth season has been. Nothing about this season has any connection to the show's former life.

Long story short, if you've just started this show and are now compulsively buying seasons, stop at seven. If you are returning to this show after a hiatus, you will be disappointed. I wish I could unsee this season.",1342828800,15,1190,4.081196581196581
4543416,3,B0053O8AAK,"Don't get me wrong, The Office isn't what it used to be, and Steve Carell's departure has hurt this flailing show taking everything into consideration. But it's too easy to point the finger at Catherine Tate and James Spader as reasons that this season was sub-par by Office standards and average by most other TV comedy standards. The fact is James Spader and Catherine Tate as Robert California and Nellie Bertram were actually continually funny throughout the season to me. And why that's so is because both of those characters are absolutely insane. That was the main ingrediant to what made the show head and shoulders above anything before it when it first started. It also had a compelling love story with Jim and Pam and besides those two characters pretty much everyone else was either completely bonkers and had some odd quirks. As the show has progressed, those characters were either toned down or became charicatures of themselves and the enduring love story has become painfully boring.

The main problem as any die hard Office fan knows stems from the writing. Andy was my favorite character and in a strange stroke of misfortune for me as a viewer Ed Helms became famous which meant the writers felt compelled to make Andy Bernard more like Stu Price. But what made Andy funny was that for the most part we used to laugh at him now we are supposed to laugh with him. The writers tried to shoehorn an upper class jerk with anger issues into a relatable character. In doing so we are basically supposed to forget who he used to be. I have been alternating watching season 3 and season 8 recently and the Andy of season 3 is a completely different person than the Andy of season 8. Real people don't change as much in 5 years as Andy has on this show, so why do the writers think we should accept this...in a mockumentary no less! But Andy is just one of many characters that has gone through this weird transformation from a quirky character into either a charaicature of themselves (Dwight, Kevin, Meredith etc.) or a bland version of the original character (Andy, Pam, Creed etc.). As others have said they tried to make Andy and Erin the new Jim and Pam but since Jim and Pam are ostensibly the only normal people (besides Darryl and Toby at first) it was doomed to fail. In fact, the Darryl and Val relationship was a way more compelling love story this season than Andy and Erin because again those two character are more or less normal.

But back to Robert and Nellie, like I said I thought they provided some of the best moments this season because they are weirdos. And along that line I think the people giving this season 1 star are overreacting. Obviously, the show is not what it used to be, but I still laugh at it occasionally and there were still some episodes this season that actually hung together for the whole episode. Also, I was encouraged with David Wallace coming back. I always HATED the Sabre story line so it's definitely a good thing to be rid of that. And frankly, I'm also not upset to see Mindy Kaling leave, she has been increasingly annoying as Kelly Kapoor since she and Ryan got back together. And I also think the increasing cutesyness and references to pop culure and internet sensations come from her as a writer so hopefully that stuff will stop now. Paul Lieberstien as Toby serves no purpose now that Michael is gone. Lieberstien as a writer may be missed but I can't remember a Lieberstien written episode that I like since season 4. So I don't know about that. I will say that I have low expectations for the planned Dwight spinoff that he will be the show runner of.

So with all of that being said I do think there are things that could possibly be good in season 9. And it's not like every second of this season was unwatchable...it's just not as good as it used to be. But sub par Office is still way better than above average Two and a Half Men.",1342569600,58,3907,4.515536723163842
4543417,1,B0053O8AAK,"I would have never predicted my favorite show on television, The Office, would have gone this sour, this fast. Its original main character, Michael Scott, played by Steve Carrel, has gotten married and moved away. Since the absence of Michael Scott, former salesman Andy Bernard, aka ""The Nard Dog"" has taken his place as the manager of the Scranton Branch for the paper company known as Sabre.
All fans knew The Office would never be the same again without Michael Scott, but I was still optimistic. I thought, that even though the bread and butter of this successful series would soon be gone, there were enough hilarious supporting characters throughout to keep this show watchable, even if it could never be absolutely fantastic again. But boy, was I wrong. This show has become so unbearingly unwatchable, and unfunny that I almost want to mourn over the memories I had of what this show used to be. Season 8 is genuinely awful, there's no getting around it.",1342396800,14,963,4.807228915662651

Without Michael Scott, this show just is not funny. Michael brought out the best in all the characters and without him the show is falling apart Literally, Kelly is leaving to start her own show and Dwight is starting a spin off (which i am looking forward to) and taking Toby with him to write it (although to be honest ever since Michael left Toby has just become a weird, unfunny character). Plus all the main characters are not as funny as they use to be. Jim and Pam's love story ended so now they just have this perfect marriage that is not funny at all and while Jim can still get a funny line every once and a while, Pam is useless. However perhaps the worst character is Andy. He cant be a manager because that is not his character. Andy is a suck up with anger issues who likes to sing and wear pink into the office and is mocked  by his co workers for it And that is why we love him. If the Office wants to get back on top, there are several things they have to do...
1. Get Dwight to stay on the show, with out him there is no THE OFFICE. You cant do the show without him, If he had left not Michael last season there would be no season eight. Dwight has to stay
2. Catherine Tate out, Her character is just annoying, She ruined the story when they went to Florida and I was upset to see her in Scranton. She is not going to ever replace Steve Carell so stop acting like she will.
3. use Jim and Pam less and start using characters that you know will get laughs from people like Kevin,Creed and Darrell more.
4. Put Andy back in sales and find someone new who will be able to run Dunder Mifflin",1342137600,8,1801,4.1164772727272725
4543419,3,B0053O8AAK,"This season was just O.K. to me. It had lots of great scenes and funny moments, but the majority of the show was just.. meh. The whole time while watching the show, it's just felt to me like the producers were just a bit confused of what they wanted to do with the show. It's like, once Michael left, they just seemed unsure of where to take the show. Ever since Will Ferrel took the seat as manager, I've been a little confused. There's been too many different managers in the big seat, and that makes the viewer confused.

Honestly, I wish they ended with Michael's goodbye episode. They can try and continue and hopefully succeed, but it'll never be the same when Michael isn't around.",1342137600,,688,4.4603174603174605

Fortunately, The Office only gets better! The dynamic of the show- the character arcs, relationships and situations are just as fresh and hilarious as they have ever been. The 'Sabre store' story arc is just one example that says this show has many more great ideas to come.
It seems silly to comment that 'things have changed since Michael left', but it seems that some reviewers expected the show to remain exactly as it always was... Season 8 is a dearture from the old formula and I'm really excited to see where the writers will take the new ideas and character relationships/ dynamics in the next season.

This lowers that comedy quality significantly. Dwight and Jim are surely entertaining as characters, and somewhat Andy, but no one can be compared to the character of Michael, who basically built the show. To be fair it is still entertaining, after the first couple of episodes where they clearly where experimenting.... I still managed to watch the entire season. Good job, but people were so used to the old fashioned seasons were Michael was the main theme of the show. It is good, only comparatively worse than the previous seasons.",1341014400,,699,4.645161290322581
4543443,3,B0053O8AAK,"Many people lamented the loss of Steve Carell from ''The Office'', and it's easy to see why; Carell was the soul of the show and the main joke-maker. Don't get me wrong, I love the Jim and Pam dynamic, and Dwight is always hysterical, but Michael was what made the show tick for me.

With his departure, I really wanted to know if the show could survive. I thought, ""Hey, I'll give the new season a go and see if it's a train wreck."" In fact, I stopped watching the series religiously mid season 5 because I started to think it was getting too ridiculous, so I came into the new season with a cleansed palette. All-in-all, it wasn't bad. All-in-all, however, it wasn't great. The episodes generally have -- as another reviewer said -- one or two really clever bits, but they are washed over and muted by other not-so-funny segments, or plotlines that were just left dangling. Remember Angela's baby? Only two and a half episodes focused on that, which would've probably been one of the main focuses of the show had this storyline been written during seasons 3-5.

Many of the characters have lost their edge. Pam and Jim are sad reflections of what they used to be. Originally, you could laugh with them: we've all had crappy jobs and having fun at your job is what makes you succeed, eventually. However, now we're laughing AT them. Jim has had the same job for eight solid years and Pam is a loser, basically. In all honesty, Jim should've gotten the manager job and Pam should've finished art school. That way, you could at least see that they are trying to get a better life. That being said, many of Jim's pranks and a ton of the cold openings this season were hysterical.

The biggest problem with this season, however, was Andy. Andy was picked to be manager, not because anyone in their right mind would've picked him (remember how he sucked at sales and DeAngela had to ""help"" him in season 7), but because his portraying actor is in those stupid ""Hang Over"" movies. That is honestly the reason: NBC thought he could fix the show. Unfortunately, he's too much of a buffoon and a ""Michael Scott Lite"". Whenever something bad happened to Andy (Andy can't impress people, Andy can't win over Erin, Andy loses his job, Andy is a janitor, Nellie is mean to Andy), I didn't care. I just didn't care at all. I wanted to see what subtle jokes Jim and Dwight were doing (get it... subtle... hahaha). However, Ellie Kemper aka Erin Hannon was the bomb this season. She really stole the show and was the reason I kept watching it. True story. She's just so funny in that spacey sort of way.

All in all, the season was hit and miss. There were some bad episodes (""Gettysburg"", ""Fundraiser""), some meh episodes (""The Incentive"", ""The List""), and some really solid ones (""Garden Party"", ""Lotto"", ""Trivia"", the entire Tallahassee arc). Honestly, I'd say the ""good"" outweighs the ""bad"", but the ""sorta decent but not brilliant/average"" outweighs the ""good"". I'd recommend that hard-core ''Office'' fans buy this set, but for the average Dunderhead, just catch the reruns on TV or download the good episodes off of iTunes sometime.",1338768000,9,3124,4.64376130198915
4543444,5,B0053O8AAK,"Some people seemed to think that The Office has taken a nose dive with the depature of Micheal Scott, but the fact of the matter is it's still as great as ever.

4543445,1,B0053O8AAK,"As much as I disliked Season 6 of The Office, in retrospect it was better than Season 8. Before the season began, we were told that because Michael Scott was no longer around the show was going to focus on the ensemble more. Instead we were fed a steady diet of Andy as the manager and his conflicts with Robert California (James Spadar) as CEO. This dull note was hit repeatedly leading to a series of repetitive episodes where Andy feels inadequate and the staff reassures him. The problem was that Andy has always been a buffoonish character and trying to shoehorn him into the central role didn't work. Couple that with the tiresome Andy/Erin relationship which had been stumbling around for three seasons without any real direction or coherence and we got a giant dose of Andy that no one wanted to see.

While Michael Scott may have been the comedic driver of the show through Season 7, it was the reactions of the rest of the cast, and especially Jim and Pam, which gave the show its emotional resonance. Now, Jim and Pam are given virtually nothing to do and the rest of the characters have been reduced to single note punch lines. John Krasinski should sue over the lack of forward motion for Jim. Jenna Fischer was also neglected this year, but some of that can be ascribed to her real life pregnancy. The treatment of the rest of the cast has been just as thoughtless. Kevin and Erin appear to be competing for some sort of stupidity award in which they barely seem like functional adults. This was especially problematic for Erin given that we were supposed to care about her romantic chances with Andy, but it mostly felt like a teenager mooning over her teacher. Stanley, Oscar and Meredith once again got little to no screen time.

About the only story of any value this year was the trip to Florida to set up the retail outlet for the Sabre tablet. This allowed for some interesting arcs using Jim and Dwight, but unfortunately also introduced us to Nellie (Catherine Tate). It seems obvious that Tate was supposed to take the manager's position, but a scheduling conflict prevented her from joining the show until mid-season. If they had given some thought into her integration into the show it might have worked, but once again no real long-term planning appears to have been done because their solution was to have her walk in one day and take Andy's job just by sitting down in his chair. Ridiculous.

This season failed on many levels and we can only hope that with a new showrunner they might come back stronger next year, but that seems like wishful thinking. As for Season 8, wait until the price drops if you have to have it to complete your collection. Otherwise skip it completely.",1338249600,110,2708,4.614107883817427

Someone else said it damaged the legacy and that could be true. Perhaps losing Steve Carell was a big blow? Perhaps the story lines are just played out? Either way, the show just seems to have lost its steam. I heartily recommend anyone who loves intelligent, timely TV programming to pick up any of the prior seasons. Seasons 3-5 are as good as it gets. Season 8....just didn't do it for me. It was OK by most TV standards, but it doesn't live up to The Office as I know it.",1338163200,22,601,4.189655172413793

I remember how big of a deal their first child was, but I have friends that still watch this show religiously didn't realize that Pam has another baby.

4543463,5,B0053O8AAK,"After having watched the first 15 episodes of this season, it's abundantly clear to me that The Office shall live on, in this post-Michael Scott era. Quite simply, this show makes me laugh, and it makes me FEEL GOOD! It's the only show on T.V. that compels me to tune in every week. I realize the season is not completely over yet, but I feel that even if there were no more episodes after the 15th one (which just aired), I would still give this year's effort a 5 star rating... it's just been that much fun for me to watch.

The strength of The Office has always been its brilliant casting. From the dreary HR rep (Toby) to the bubbly Customer Service employee (Kelly) to the gung-ho salesman (Dwight), and everybody else (Stanley, Kevin, Creed, Andy, Erin, Oscar, Meredith, Angela, Todd Packer, etc.). These characters nail the essence of their stereotypes (as anybody who has worked in an office can tell you!), and they do it with hilarity. It's because of this incredibly strong cast that the show can go on, should any one character leave the show... including the loveable Michael Scott. Don't get me wrong, we'd love to have him return... but he knew that he was leaving the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin in darned good hands when he left!

The following are some of my favorite moments from this season (No Spoilers! The following incidents are just random, isolated bits of funniness. They do not impact the main storylines or divulge secrets):

-Mose driving Toby's car at full speed into a cornfield, while performing ""valet parking"".
-Jim playing his best prank yet on Dwight: Faking his own murder in a hotel room, and framing Dwight by sketching his name across the closet door in fake blood.
-Andy absolutely CUTTING LOOSE in the warehouse, dancing like a maniac, throwing Styrofoam peanuts everywhere, and trashing the place (""stress relief"" as he calls it).",1329609600,5,1880,4.7607361963190185
4543464,1,B0053O8AAK,"I'm kind of sad about the whole thing.  Quit watching tv a few years ago, then somehow, thru Netflix, I stumbled on the brit original 'The Office', and fell in love with it, just thought it was orignal and great, hard and funny.  So, like many, I certainly wasn't interested in the American version.  But I saw a review of it, just a year ago, and liked what I read, so I actually started downloading it on Amazon, and thought that they'd actually pulled it off, that Steve Carell had made it his own, and I actually, got t.v. turned on, after watching the first six years available here.

But after Steve left, the show has been floundering.  I never did like the Andy Bernard character, not when he was second in command, and particularly not after he took Michael's job.  There is a fine line between creating an obnoxious humorous character, and just creating an unappealing one without humor.  It doesn't work anymore.  I can't even watch the show with much enjoyment.  I try, once in a while, hoping they can pull it off again.  James Spader, I like, always have, but doesn't seem to be doing much here either.
