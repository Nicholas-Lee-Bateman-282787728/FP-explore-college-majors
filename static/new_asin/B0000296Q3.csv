1251819,3,B0000296Q3,"My child enjoys the tape and that is good. He has enjoyed Baby Mozart and Baby Bach preceding this tape.
My one problem with the tape is that both sexes are not represented. The creators apparently use their own children  in the skits,  who are all girls.  I think both sexes should be  represented. As it stands now , it sends a subtle and wrong message.",944697600,6,355,4.333333333333333
1251880,5,B0000296Q3,"When my son was two months old I bought him Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart.  We used to watch it and listen to Mozart music all the time.  I noticed at that age he was aware of his surrounding earlier than his age.  I bought him all Julie Clarks videos, books and flash cards (Baby Bach, Baby Shekspere, Baby Van Gogh and Baby Santa).  Now at age two he know all his numbers, letters, animals and colors.  the videos are designed in a way that attracts the children and enhance their thinking.  Julie Clark is very amazing and she did a wonderful job",980121600,,549,4.281553398058253
1251881,5,B0000296Q3,"My little boy(2yrs old) really enjoys this video. When the little girls sings their abc's he jumps right in and sings his abc's with them. He also likes to dance alot while watching this video.
There are 12 words that are explored in pictures and poem form. They are: train,flower,apple,cat,grass,frog,leaf,snow,tree,cow,butterfly and moon.
It's really nice to watch this video with your child, point to an object and then name that object as your child views the video with you.",978220800,,479,5.075949367088608
1251882,5,B0000296Q3,"We were introduced to this video when our daughter Grace was seven months old. I regret not having exposed her earlier, since she loved it right from the start. She is now 17 months old and we have gotten her the entire Baby Einstein collection. Amazingly she loves them all and has learned enthusiastically from all the videos. It is obvious to us that babies understand so much more than we can imagine and these videos are such a lovely introduction to learning.",972000000,,465,4.614457831325301
1251883,5,B0000296Q3,"This video is an absolute favorite of my 16 month old son!  He is not a big TV or video watcher, but he is totally captivated and excited by Baby Shakespeare.  He laughs out loud, dances, and anticipates what's coming next.  He growls along with the tiger puppet and squeals at the sight of baby's ""piggy toes"" running through the grass.  He claps when the children sing their ABC's.  This video has 100% of his attention, but he's not sitting like a lump, hypnotized by what he's watching.  He is learning, feeling, and interacting with this video like nothing I've ever seen with such a young child!  And the best part of him being so enchanted by this video is that he wants to share it with me - he wants me to help him interact, point things out, clap, and dance along.  It is a very special event for the both of us!  Baby Shakespeare is only our second in the Baby Einstein series, and I am looking forward to completing our collection with all of the videos.  I am anxiously awaiting the delivery of Baby Santa - we can't wait!!  Thank you Julie Aigner-Clark, for giving us such a brilliant chain of videos for our children - unlike any other children's videos I've ever seen.  Barney and The Teletubbies can't hold a candle to your Baby Einstein series!",971913600,17,1262,4.439130434782609
1251884,5,B0000296Q3,My son loves this video. He watches it over and over. We have had to purchase another tape because he wore out the first one. By far this is one of the best videos I have ever seen for children. It beats Barney and Sesame Street hands down!!!,967680000,,242,4.0625
1251885,5,B0000296Q3,"My 16-month-old son was absolutely fascinated by this video, and wanted to watch it almost constantly (well, until we got Barney on video, but that's another story).  We all loved the background music as well as the beautiful  poems & bright toys they showed.  Ryan's favorite part was when the  kids sang the ABC song, although I was a bit disturbed that all of the  children were girls.  Couldn't they find ANY boys?",960508800,6,418,4.657534246575342
1251886,5,B0000296Q3,"After the other three videos were a hit (although Baby Bach is the weakest) my 10-month-old absolutely loves this new one. She laughs and smiles whenever the now familiar kids come on and especially when they all sing the A-B-Cs. As long as Julie Clark and Co. keep producing these, we'll  keep buying them. And I too have given many of them as baby gifts...",956361600,4,358,4.507692307692308
1251887,5,B0000296Q3,i have all four videos and this one is the best one out of the bunch.  it is a must have if you have seen any of the other videos.,954201600,3,130,3.3333333333333335
1251888,5,B0000296Q3,"Hands down, this is not only the best of the Baby Einstein series but it is also one of the best children's videos ever created. Our nine-month old daughter laughs at the silly puppet shows, listens intently to the music  and poetry, and watches raptly as the brilliant graphics and toys dance  on-screen. Nearly everything in this video is also entertaining for the  adults; my wife and I will be watching this one with our baby for years to  come. It is rare to see a children's video that is made with such love and  attention to entertaining and educating children, and that is not made with  the sole intent of making a fast buck off our child. We can't wait for Baby  Van Gogh!",948931200,58,683,4.416

7915534,4,B0000296Q3,"Our daughter is now 14 months old and seems to be outgrowing her beloved Baby Mozart and Baby Bach. She loves both Neighborhood Animals and World Animals, but her favorites these days are Baby Van Gogh and Baby Shakespeare. They're so colorful they really hold her attention AND she especially loves the ABC song in Baby Shakespeare. She also likes to clap at the end of a segment before the curtain opens again - a cute convention with the toy camera introducing each one. It's also full of cute puppets that she's so into these days. And I have to say that the readings chosen for Baby Shakespeare are much better than those in Van Gogh. The only segment that wasn't up to par was the one with the cymbal-playing monkey. They spent way too much time on that one toy and it's the only segment that lags.",1074729600,,804,4.4391891891891895
7915535,5,B0000296Q3,The Baby Einstein videos are truly a godsend in our home and this is one of the best in the group!  My son started watching these videos right after his first birthday and he adores them.  They are entertaining and educational.  The poetry is beautiful and timeless.  I recommend this to any parent with a child between the ages of 1 and 3.,1058140800,3,340,4.349206349206349
7915536,4,B0000296Q3,"Thought the tape was excellent, but a little old for babies.  Baby Mozart was a 10star tape.",1029456000,3,92,4.411764705882353
7915537,5,B0000296Q3,My son is 1 and loves this video. I just purchased the other three today and I can't wait to see him engrosed in the video. I think the word Stimulate is an understatement.,1002585600,,172,4.088235294117647
7915538,5,B0000296Q3,"My 2 year old daughter loves this video-she has loved it since we purchased it several months ago.  ""Baby Mozart"" thoroughly entertained her from 4months old until at least 1- now ""Baby Shakespeare"" and ""Baby Dolittle"" are her favorites.  She is so happy seeing the puppets and dancing to the songs.  I am a big fan of this series-with ""Baby Shakespeare"" maybe being the best one.",1001203200,,380,4.7272727272727275
7915539,5,B0000296Q3,"This is our son's (13 months old) favorite video, and it's yet another ""perfect 10"" in the Baby Einstein Company's impressive series of videos! I hold a Master's degree in the field of infant speech-language and communicative development, and I would definitely recommend this particular video for your own baby's speech-language and cognitive facilitation and development. This visually and auditorally creative and stimulating video also provides an excellent opportunity for parental interaction and facilitation which will enhance your baby's (and toddler's) overall cognitive-communicative skills and development to a greater degree than other infant videos which typically require little or no active participation from or interaction between the child and his/her parents. (Tip: fast forward to the end of the video credits for some simple yet highly effective communication-enhancing ideas and strategies to utilize while watching the video with your child.). This video (and accompanying book of poetry) scores a perfect ""10"" on all accounts!",999734400,17,1051,5.8311688311688314
7915540,5,B0000296Q3,This video is recommended for 1-4 year olds but my 7 month daughter is totally engaged by it.  We have the entire series of Baby Einstein videos from Baby Einstein to Baby Dolittle World Animals but Baby Shakespeare is definitely her favorite.  My guess is that she likes to hear the voice of Julie Aigner-Clark reciting the poems and also enjoys watching the faces of the children while they sing ABCs.,995932800,13,403,4.661971830985915
7915541,5,B0000296Q3,"We have purchased a lot of videos for our 13 month old son, and this is the best.  This is very professional, has good music (Beethoven), teaches some basic words and the alphabet, and is quite funny.  I've seen this video many many times, and I still enjoy it and laugh at some scenes.  My son loves it, and he gets excited when we watch it.  He doesn't understand it all yet, but he loves the music, video, and animal characters.  I would highly recommend it for 12 months and older.",992822400,,485,4.285714285714286
7915542,5,B0000296Q3,"My 7 month old has loved this video since he was 4 months old.  It says it is for 1-4 year olds, but he just laughs at all the funny parts.  I think these Einstein videos are absolutely wonderful!  It teaches him so much!!",992217600,,222,4.0
