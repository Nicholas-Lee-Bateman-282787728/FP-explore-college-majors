8588596,5,B000E1DTCQ,"Corduroy is no ordinary teddy bear. Just when you least expect it (as when you are asleep), he comes to life. He is full of antics.

A little girl (Lisa) loses Corduroy at a laundry. She pleads with the owner to find him. The mischievous teddy bear ends up, by mistake, at a boy's house. At night, Corduroy comes to life and rides on a skateboard across the home. The parents lock up the dog, thinking that he is the one making all the nighttime commotion. Corduroy gets away.

Lisa continues to miss Corduroy. He takes a ride on a truck chute, and ends up locked in in a box for shipping. The suspense is obvious to all: Will Corduroy and Lisa ever see each other again?

As a teacher, I have found that this DVD holds the attention of small children very well.",1257724800,5,762,4.277777777777778
