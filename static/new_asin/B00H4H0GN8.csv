He is a stand-up, honest guy who ashtrays puts forth 100%. Good job guys, keep it up!  Furthermore, the negative reviews are coming from couch potatoes who aren't attempting their hand at acting, they aren't acting coaches... J/S!",1447459200,,379,4.742424242424242
8629873,3,B00H4H0GN8,"At first I forced myself to watch this movie. Then learned that these were local actors at their first shot at some screen time, so I kept watching just to show some support. The acting was too overt, it needed more subtlety . I liked the idea of how someone goes from being the quiet neighbor next door to being the guy on the 6 o'clock news who is on a murderous rampage. This is a first attempt at movie making ,so go into it with that in mind and you may just like.
To Keith Goff keep putting the work. I look forward to your next effort.",1394323200,,542,4.027777777777778

8629875,4,B00H4H0GN8,"After reading the description of this movie costing less than $3,000 and using first time cast and crew, I believed that this was another low quality look, bad acting, shaky camera, etc. However, my friend said it wasn't that bad so I bought it and WOW, I was amazed at the quality first. This was well shot. However, the acting was all over the place but well expected for first timers. I do think that with a bigger budget this will be a great movie.",1391731200,,452,4.329411764705882
8629876,5,B00H4H0GN8,"I give ""Trey the Movie"" 5 Stars, because Antonio James his story line & gave us something unusual in the main character. The plot wasn't predictable. The work, knowledge & talent it took to create, develope & bring to life his vision was one that more noted & financially secure director's doubted would come to fruition. Therefore, I applaud Mr. James & his entire film staff for having the belief & discipline to make this project a reality. Determination goes a long way in the face of doubt & this is a great example of it. Blessings to the success of this completed project & to any future endeavors.
