So if you have seen these films, there is no need to restate the plots, but if you have not seen them, then you are in for Classic Set of Hitchcock during the Selznick period. Curious? I recommend these films for our DVD Collection.",1436572800,,328,4.672413793103448

6253195,5,B00I83WHSO,"SPELLBOUND was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and produced by David O. Selznick in 1945. As the story unravels it is essentially a murder plot interwoven around psychiatrists and psychoanalysis. It is actually Alfred Hitchcock's approach to the story and his collaborations with composer Miklos Rozsa and surrealist artist Salvador Dali that highlights this film. Gregory Peck plays John ""J.B."" Ballantine who poses as a psychiatrist while in a state of amnesia. Uncovered by Dr. Constance Peterson played by Ingrid Bergman, Ballantine must find out if he is responsible for the death of the missing psychiatrist that he posed as and simultaneously discover his own identity. Miklos Rozsa's score is both romantic yet eerie as Ballantine tries to remember what happened through analysis of his dreams. Alfred Hitchcock hired Salvador Dali to design illustrations and paintings in order to construct a crisp and vivid rendering of these dreams. Hitchcock did not want to use conventional techniques such as blurred camera shots to recreate the dreams. He wanted them to be as clear and even sharper than the rest of the film. He wanted Dali's style of using shadows, lines of convergence and the idea of infinite distance incorporated into the dream sequences. In the dream sequence we see a black stage highlighted with people at gambling tables with huge mysterious looking eyes peering over them. A man cuts away at the fabric of one eye with a giant scissors revealing another eye. In another part of the dream we see a man standing on a roof behind a chimney that has sprouted roots. The hooded man holds what looks like a deformed or eccentric wagon wheel in his hand. In the distance there is a formation of rocks and boulders, which look like they are sprouting into the shape of a man's head. Another part of the dream shows a man running down a pitched geometric plane as the shadow of a bird follows him. In the background there are geometric shapes and lines that go off into infinity. All these images must be interpreted into experiences from reality. Dali's images are unsettling and thought provoking. Eventually, the eccentric wagon wheel turns out to represent the chambers of a revolver pistol and reveals the true identity of the murderer. A surrealistic painting brings to the canvas an image from reality but puts it into a context of the unreal. I think Dali was successful in translating the realistic elements from the plot into a vision of incomprehensibility of the conscious human mind. Hitchcock and the scriptwriter Ben Hecht then had their characters translate Dali's images back into plausible reality. This is brilliant filmmaking years ahead of its time.

NOTORIOUS is Alfred Hitchcock's wartime romantic thriller. Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi spy living in the United States. Her father has been convicted of treason as we see from open doors outside the courtroom. Bergman an amorous and promiscuous playgirl who is reluctantly conscripted by an enigmatic American espionage agent Cary Grant, finds herself in more peril than she bargained for on her assignment in Brazil. This has always been considered one of Hitchcock's better thrillers. NOTORIOUS is absolutely intriguing and deliberately paced. As an Alfred Hitchcock enthusiast it took me some time to realize the power of this film. I even watched this film again before I wrote this review. For me it no longer seems out of step from his other films. In a strange way it jumps ahead to a style Hitchcock employed in 1969's ""TOPAZ."" For me the romanticism combined with Cary Grant introspective performance rank this among Hitchcocks best.

Despite much talk and disagreement as to who contributed what to it, REBECCA is definitely an Alfred Hitchcock film. Producer David O. Selznick hands-on approach to producing definitely is evident, yet the film does not look entirely like your typical Selznick movie for that period. I would think this is director Alfred Hitchcock's doing. Yet again, it does not resemble the style that Hitchcock employed in his first American film, FOREIGN CORESPONDENT.",1413676800,14,4100,5.063609467455621

8639718,5,B00I83WHSO,It was great to receive these three Hitchcock directed films in one box:  As  I recall the three cost me about the same as if I purchased ` them separately. Also Rebecca was not available as a single DVD.,1504396800,,204,4.205128205128205

8639722,5,B00I83WHSO,"These three classic Hitchcock movies are displayed in detailed B&W (as originally filmed). The DVD quality is impressive and the old mono soundtrack comes across as well as can be expected considering the old technology used to capture sound back then. I thoroughly enjoyed all three movies and the special features offer interesting, expert analysis about the films, how they were made, and their impact on the history of filmmaking. I wish the Spellbound disc contained a feature on the outstanding and famous music using the fermion (is that the correct word?). While watching Notorious I was constantly reminded of the little touches found in Gene Wilders Frankenstein movie, he must have been inspired by Hitchcock. As the set contains three DVDs, one for each movie, this set is a super bargain.",1473552000,,801,5.075757575757576

I've always been a fan of his ""scary"" movies, but I really love these earlier films by the master of suspense. ""Rebecca"" with Lawrence Olivier is stunning as is ""Notorious"" with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman.",1464307200,,274,4.956521739130435
