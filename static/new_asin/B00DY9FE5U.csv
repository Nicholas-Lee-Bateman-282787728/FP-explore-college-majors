8599030,1,B00DY9FE5U,"I'd love to be able to tell you that this movie was great. That it was a beautiful love story about two people in a band who fell in love. And the songs bled with empathy for their heart wrenching story. That the musical score was incredible, the acting and story line were riveting and had me glued to my seat and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen... http://tompetty.rocks/news/item/56-the-movie",1417046400,,401,4.661971830985915
8599031,1,B00DY9FE5U,Wow this was really bad. Wish I could get a refund. The main character isn't very likeable although his friend & drummer in the band is a amiable sidekick. The acting is very bad so is the premise. Focuses way too much on the lead character & his backup singer's rocky relationship. If I was Tom Petty I would sue the makers for not only mentioning his name although it was in praise but actually using his name in the title. Especially in the HATE part. The punk likes Tom Petty because he has it all musically but he  is not even worthy of cleaning his tour bus.,1414108800,8,564,4.222222222222222
