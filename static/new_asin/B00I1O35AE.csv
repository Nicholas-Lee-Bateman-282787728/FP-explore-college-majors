Star Performance by Brother Billy and the rest of the cast.",1393372800,2,137,4.708333333333333
6247145,5,B00I1O35AE,A wonderful written and directed gothic thriller! Great cast; wonderful performances. Takes you into an insight of snake handling used in some faiths. Definitely worth viewing!,1393372800,2,176,5.8076923076923075
6247146,4,B00I1O35AE,"Really neat little indie horror. Stylish, but still interested in character development as it delivers what you'd want out of this sort of film in unexpected ways. People who have liked any of their previous work (The Hamiltons, The Violent Kind) will certainly appreciate the sensibilities on display here -- it retains the personality inherent to their prior efforts, but with a refined level of execution. Definitely worth a watch.",1393027200,,434,5.214285714285714
6247147,5,B00I1O35AE,"Loved this one.  Damaged lead characters, a cult-like snake-handling church... a slow-burning ominous vibe, leading up to evil unmasked.  Great acting, cinematography, and story.",1393027200,,178,6.375
6247148,5,B00I1O35AE,Wonderful performances and filled with rich and urgent cinematography. I was with it from the beginning to the end. I love the risks the film took and that it asked real questions about the dangers of absolute faith. A lot of fun.,1392940800,,230,4.5
6247149,3,B00I1O35AE,"Charlotte (Emma Greenwell) is a bar tender whose mother died when she was 15, from at least one story that she tells. She gets a letter from her long lost sister Elizabeth (Buffy Charlet) who needs to be rescued from a church of snake handlers on Sugar Mountain. Using her life savings of $200 she entices Wayne (Brendan McCarthy) an Afghan war veteran who drinks heavily, gets used as a punching bag, and has other issues. He pretends to be her daddy. When they don't see her sister, she pretends she wants to join the church.

The plot becomes a little twisty, but not overly so. Joe Egender who played Brother Billy, the preacher was not convincing. While the plot progressed, it seemed like it went no where. The sound track was inconsistent as at times it made you feel you were watching a grindhouse, but it wasn't.

Soft 3 stars.

6247150,2,B00I1O35AE,"I realize that ""The Holy Ghost People"" was shot under trying conditions with pushed B&W 16mm film. That being said, this rendition looks truly bad, as if it were taken from someone's old VHS copy. There needs to be a DVD of this excellent and groundbreaking documentary sourced professionally from the original film.",1355961600,,316,4.981132075471698
6247151,5,B00I1O35AE,I like it. Got a couple for Christmas gifts.,1411689600,,44,4.0
6247152,4,B00I1O35AE,"I'll tell you what I didn't like first..the ""hero"" Wayne, wonderfully played by Brendan McCarthy, at the beginning is being beaten up by 5 guys, WHY? I don't know. The ""heroine"" kind of annoying Emma Greenwell, lies to Wayne to get him to help her get her sister away from a religious cult, why lie? I don't know. The cult has snakes? Is this Haiti? Why? I don't know. This takes place in the hills of southern somewhere, WHY? I don't know. Oh and the beginning is very slow....wait for it. Putting all that aside, when things started to happen I did like it, very gritty Brendan McCarthy is perfect as the drunken savior, the supporting cast are all very competent. the stand out performance goes to Brendan Egender as the evil Brother Billy. he exudes some kind of silent menace that is positively creepy.",1409616000,,807,4.572413793103448
6247153,1,B00I1O35AE,"This film is a total piece of garbage.  It is based on a very fine documentary (1967) of the same name, directed by Peter Adair.  This movie is a ripoff, filled with cliches and caricatures.  A totally worthless piece of trash.",1405814400,,227,4.487804878048781
6247154,1,B00I1O35AE,"I could not finish the movie it was so bad. Bad acting, bad story, no direction worth my time.
Do not waste your time.",1402704000,,118,3.9583333333333335
6247155,5,B00I1O35AE,"I wonder if most of the negative reviews here are based on the film's classification of 'thriller', and the fact it's often referenced as 'horror'. Whatever you consider the stories of  Flannery O'Connor, that is what Holy Ghost People falls under. ""Southern Gothic Psychological Drama""? Although the acting was really strong, especially Brendan McCarthy, and the church's grounds were a perfect mixture of creepiness and reality, I think what impressed and surprised me most was how the film never ventured into camp, cheese, action, horror, or unreality. My wife (who gives it 3.5 stars) was hoping for more overt scares, more of a deadening atmosphere. However, this film felt very real. It provides valuable insights into the desperate motivations behind cult members, as well as their leader. No character here is cut and dry, none without their bits of light and harder edges; nobody is per se good or evil, and motivations are a bit blurred. It also gave a glimpse into how loyal cult members can still, when the cards are down, recognize the BS of their situation. There is a mounting sense of dread and tension throughout the film, but, although many commenters have complained that the ending isn't action/horror enough, it ends fairly ambiguously. Nobody really 'wins' here. Nobody's wounds are healed, the religious or nonreligious. If you escape this cult compound, you only return to the loneliness that made you want to leave the 'real world'. So, if you enjoy a solid Southern Gothic character-driven drama with elements of mystery/thriller, then I think you'll enjoy this.",1401580800,5,1589,5.111538461538461
6247156,3,B00I1O35AE,"Nothing creeps me out like cults and snakes, and all of the elements were there to tell a great story, but all that this movie amounts to is just a flat low budget talk fest with no suspense or intelligent acting, it was less than a Lifetime movie.. The cult leader looks like actor Giovanni Ribisi.. A generic version of The Lost Boys theme is sung at the film's supposed climax, but the ending was a huge let down. The only horrifying thing,  is that I purchased this in HD on Amazon Prime Video, and it will haunt my library for years to come..",1400371200,,547,4.259615384615385
6247157,4,B00I1O35AE,"All of the actors in this movie did a good job, no over acting. Not allot of special effects but heavy on story build-up. I was slightly disappointed about the conclusion at the end of the movie. Could have had more details added to the end.",1400371200,,241,4.260869565217392
6247158,2,B00I1O35AE,"This movie had potential, the powerful acting by Joe Egender made this movie worth watching, not sure I would recommend -",1399680000,,121,4.809523809523809
6247159,3,B00I1O35AE,"This was a good movie.. I purchased it, so I was not disappointed that I did buy. I would recommend that it should be rented first before making the investment to buy.  It has a plot and story line that didn't make lose interest. The characters are believable. So give it a try.",1399507200,,278,4.245283018867925
6247160,4,B00I1O35AE,"I googled the director who referred to this film as ""Southern Gothic Thriller"", which is a good description. Its not a horror movie and when I clicked on it to purchase, I thought I clicked on something else and so I was wondering what was going on, lol. Seriously, its a fine movie. The production is fine, the acting is strong, the plot is intriguing, suspenseful and generates good tension, which it successfully maintains through the climax. Its not a jump out of your seat kind of film though. I really enjoyed it despite it not being what i thought it was. I'm very glad I saw it.",1398643200,,586,4.435185185185185
6247161,3,B00I1O35AE,The movie held my interest all the way through. Some scenes seemed a bit out of place (the b/w footage from the 60's holy ghost documentary) otherwise it was a decent watch.,1398211200,,173,4.4375
6247162,3,B00I1O35AE,If you are into religious movies of a sort then you may fid this interesting. I never understood the problem of the main male character or why the female lead felt I necessary to lie in the beginning.  But then again it may just be me because I can never understand how adults let one or two people take over their lives and commit murder in the name of religion.  But the movie itself did contain suspense and that was enough for me to watch it to the end. You will figure out pretty quickly where it was going but I had hope for a twist.,1396396800,,539,4.0754716981132075
6247163,2,B00I1O35AE,"I was looking forward to this movie, as it had a very original and thought provoking premise. Alas, the execution was as poor as I feared it would be. Billed as a Horror movie, there were some elements that were creepy, but none that would make even the most sensitive person shudder. It was just a poorly made film, all around. The acting was spectacular, the cinematography was exquisite and the soundtrack was thoughtfully implemented. It was the script, however, that ruined this otherwise competent film. Avoid this as it has very little worthwhile going for it. What a waste.",1395532800,,581,4.82
6247164,3,B00I1O35AE,"This is listed under horror movies but it's more of a thriller really.  It's low budget but the acting is pretty good and the story is definitely interesting.  The story is that a young woman hires a drunken ex-Marine to give her a ride to find her sister who is apparently living in a sort of religious commune up in the mountains.  They both end up becoming guests of the ""church"" which practices snake handling and other unusual practices.",1395273600,,442,4.569620253164557
6247165,4,B00I1O35AE,This was a nice movie for me..It was worth renting and wouldnt mind seeing it again in the future at some point.,1395100800,,112,4.136363636363637
6247166,5,B00I1O35AE,"Watch it. Acting is great, camera work is not overly artistic, story line is through and also leaves you with something to think about. Realistic and thats what makes it interesting to watch, well not the only thing. Good movie indeed..",1394928000,,236,4.780487804878049

6247169,4,B00I1O35AE,"I simply rented this movie because of the trailer and the fact that I enjoy crime/thriller/horror/etc type movies but this movie is more of a slow build up mystery that surrounds a weird church cult that lives in the middle of the woods.  It's pretty much a basic story of a sister who is trying to find her other sister that seems to be stuck at the weird church cult but can't find a ride up to the woods and instead pays some ex-soldier man who drinks a lot. Anyways, its not a bad rental and worth checking out if you don't mind a slow build up towards a not so bad ending but don't expect to see a lot of gore or a lot of kills. This is more of a 1 hour crime story that you may see on HBO series but instead this story is fleshed out into a full 90 minute movie.",1394582400,,768,3.923076923076923

No where in scripture should anyone tempt God by handling snakes or intentionally drinking poison. So if you want accurate info about the Holy Spirit, it isn't here by a long shot.

8638274,5,B00I1O35AE,"""Holy Ghost People"" (1967) is possibly not only one of the greatest documentaries of all time, but also one of the greatest films of all time. Under appreciated but brilliant filmmaker Peter Adair gives the viewer a look into the lives of Pentecostal Christians in West Virginia who seek a close relationship with the Holy Spirit. As an expression of their faith, devotion and as a testimony to being filled with the Holy Spirit, they take up poisonous snakes, discuss drinking strychnine and who speak in tongues. The subjects leave themselves and their beliefs open to the judgement or scorn of anyone who watches them in worship, seeming only to ultimately care about the judgement of God and the Holy Trinity they worship.

In response to another reviewer's low rating of the film based on the deteriorated condition but not content of available prints of the film, YES, it would be wonderful to see a fully restored version of the film generated from the best available print of it. A better copy of the film does exist than the one that is commercially available or that can watched online. A documentary on Peter Adair features footage from an incredibly superior print of Holy Ghost People. Still, despite the grainy, high contrast versions you are more likely to come across, Holy Ghost People is a beautiful document of men and women attempting to worship God in a way in which they are literally putting their lives on the line.

Do not confuse Peter Adair's film with a opportunistic, unimportant, fictional 2013 movie of the same name which uses footage from Adair's masterpiece.",1420848000,,1592,4.870848708487085
