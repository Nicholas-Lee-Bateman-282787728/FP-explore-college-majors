8468728,5,B0044GF0A6,"This movies reflects life in one of rural areas in Tajikistan at time when there were created borders between former Soviet Union republics. It explores all nonsense of that process: 1) people, who lived in one community for centuries are suddenly divided; 2) in order to discipline people and have them learn that there are borders now, there applied violence (government of country called ""X"" locates mines across the boarder and as result innocent people die).
