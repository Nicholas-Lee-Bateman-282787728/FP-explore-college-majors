8756188,2,B01DKNT7J8,"This is based on a true story about Pvt. John Barrows (John Harrison) a British paratrooper separated from Normandy on D-Day. He is portrayed as someone who is not cut out for war. He manages to meet some allies, but they are portrayed in such a manner to make Barrows, the ""voice of reason"" giving a deeper meaning to the film, one that I didn't quite grasp. Murphy (James Boyland) is the overbearing leader of the group and at one time is called worse than the Nazis. Private Filey took a shot to the head and is not all there repeating the last word of other people's statements like Dim from ""Clockwork Orange."" American George Summers, nicknamed ""Rock"" (Adam Woodward) is a mute, suffering from shock and stress.

The action at times is surreal with the classical music and whimsical soundtracks. This was clearly supposed to something besides a war film, considering how it failed on that point. Was it an anti-war film? Was it supposed to show 4 natures of man? Was it a plug for Cream of Mushroom soup? Unless you want something other than a war film, you might look somewhere else.",1483056000,,1090,4.589743589743589
