7900793,5,7885723313,"Harry Powell (Mitchum) is a preacher with severe mental issues. The man talks to himself, has the words ""love"" and ""hate"" tattooed on his fingers, and is obsessed with ""vain women"" who lure men to sin with lust. It's Powell's ""mission"" then to destroy these women with his switchblade.

Powell is arrested in a stolen Model T while leaving the scene of his latest carnage. In jail, he meets a condemned man named Harper (Graves) and learns that his cellmate has a pilfered $10,000 stashed away, but is unable to find out where he's hidden it. Once released, the preacher locates Harper's wife and begins courting her, hoping she'll lead him to the loot. When physical attraction occurs between the two, the demented reverend returns to his primary mission: to rid the Earth of wicked females!

Robert Mitchum's only Oscar nomination was for supporting actor in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-STORY-OF-G-I-JOE/dp/6305837406/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE STORY OF G.I. JOE</a>&nbsp;(1944).

(8.2) The Night of the Hunter (1955) - Robert Mitchum/Shelley Winters/Lillian Gish/James Gleason/Peter Graves/Billy Chapin (uncredited: John Hamilton/Michael Chapin)

CAST TRIVIA--

The only picture directed by Charles Laughton, who purportedly rewrote the entire James Agee script. This story was proved false in 2004, when Agee's first draft for the movie was discovered and found to be identical to the finished work.

Kids annoyed Laughton, so Robert Mitchum directed several scenes involving children.

Although widely considered a classic now, on first release, ""Hunter"" did poorly at the box office.

Billy Chapin (John Harper) is brother of Lauren (""Kitten"" on TV's ""Father Knows Best""). Their brother Michael is uncredited here as Ruby's boyfriend.

Gary Cooper refused the role of Harry Powell, thinking it might ruin his career if he played the crazed holy man. Robert Mitchum lobbied for the part and got it.

Mitchum hated working with Shelley Winters.

Lillian Gish (Rachel Cooper) was cast because Laughton admired her work.

James Gleason (Birdie Steptoe), who played Lt. Rooney in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944) and was ""Gillis"" in the film version of ""The Life of Riley"" (1949), fought in the Spanish-American War of 1898.

John Hamilton (uncredited townsman who greets Rachel) had a long screen career but is best remembered by modern audiences as Perry White on TV's ""The Adventures of Superman.""",1363824000,4,2529,5.518134715025907
