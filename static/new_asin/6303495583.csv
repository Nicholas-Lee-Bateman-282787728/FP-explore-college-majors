7849545,4,6303495583,"Review of ""La Rupture"" (Claude Chabrol, 1970)

No time is wasted here getting to the action.  The opening scene, in which Charles Rgnier (the strangely androgynous Jean-Claude Drouot) injures his son during a domestic dispute, is disturbing.  However, this is not a horror film, but rather a black comedy.  As nefarious as certain moments in this picture can be -- The characters, whether good or bad, are imbued with humor and humanity.  Stphane Audran is both vulnerable and tough in her outstanding performance as Hlne Rgnier, a barmaid and ex-stripper who is brutalized by her husband, mentally-ill Charles.  After Charles moves back in with his parents to recuperate, Charles' father, the wealthy and unscrupulous Ludovic Rgnier (Michel Bouquet) hires shady Paul Thomas (Jean Pierre Cassel) to dig up dirt on Hlne, so that Charles can gain custody of his son.  In the meantime, Hlne moves into a boarding house, across from the hospital where her son is recuperating from his injuries, and encounters a kooky bunch of eccentrics (i.e. three wise-cracking old ladies who play ""Tarot"" cards).  The plot of the film takes a detour near the end; as another Amazon reviewer noted, the close of this picture is ""psychedelic"".  The scenario becomes goofy and even nonsensical, involving orange juice spiked with acid, a meditation on the color blue and a man strolling by selling multi-color balloons -- As Hlne sits in the park tripping with the 3 old ladies.  ""La Rupture"" is a good film, with many great moments, as well as being very representative of its time AKA the changing morals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  The often ridiculous / over-the-top atmosphere of this eerie picture is also complemented by a great soundtrack (composed by Pierre Jansen).

7849546,5,6303495583,"not sure its a *****, but I also don't think a *** average rating does it justice, it is OTT and bizarre and deliberately provocative/sensational, different from the more 'classic', restrained work, and more in Chabrol's 'decadent' zone, but still a powerful and intriguing piece.",1483401600,,280,5.2444444444444445
7849547,1,6303495583,"This movie is good but DON'T buy this DVD with the label ""Pathfinder Home Entertainment"" on the cover. It's the worst job I ever saw on a DVD, the image is AWFUL, the aspect ratio is not respected (1:33:1 instead of 1:66:1), the colours are horrible. Amazon should not even sell such a product. You can't enjoy this film with that copy, so If you want to see it I highly recommend another editor. Same thing with ""Just before night fall"".",1389312000,3,438,4.419753086419753
7849548,3,6303495583,"It is intriguing how the same faces appear and reappear in Claude Chabrol's films, often in carbon-copy parts. La Rupture is yet another shake of the master's kaleidoscope: the same themes, shapes, colours, but cleverly rearranged to create the impression of a different movie. As always, the acting and direction are superb.
Audran and Cassel, and indeed almost everyone else, fit their parts like so many gloves. The composition of the images and the fast-slow-quick-quick-slow pace created by his editing allows the film to glide with the exciting grace of a foxtrot. Yet,as too often with this director, the pieces making up the imagery are of variable taste and credibility. The horrific opening has a ring of truth, as we are all conditioned to the horrors of domestic violence that dominates the headlines of the world's less intellectual newspapers. The Tarot-playing tittle-tattling old maids, full of venomous gossip,are recognizable --- if not from life itself --- then from literature and other movies. The divorce proceedings and the parental reactions are all standard, as we all know only two well as members of a society that has achieved the highest divorce rate in history. But that the latter should go to the lengths they did and accept complicity in the bird-brained schemes of Cassel and his ridiculous moll shatters the integrity of what could have been a genuine work of cinematic art, and reduces it to no more than a piece of chic entertainment that we want to dismiss from our memory the moment the credits start to appear on the screen.",1349654400,,1564,4.996168582375479
7849549,2,6303495583,"Not one of Chabrol's best despite interesting plot and characterizations. Horrific scene of domestic violence opens the film: father violently attacks wife and then throws his small child across the room, which cracks the boy's head open on the kitchen floor. And later we are subjected to a disturbing sequence of child molestation (the actress who portrays the young girl is a woman dressed as a child, but the portrayal is of a mentally disabled girl who is drugged and molested while forced to watch pornography, and then is INEXPLICABLY shown later to have actually enjoyed it). This sequence makes absolutely no sense to the plot whatsoever and is absolutely REVOLTING. Frequently over-the-top and exaggerated themes in this film prove to be a huge turn off. I just couldn't see past these barriers to understand the true meanings in this work, if there were any. One could skip this film altogether in the Chabrol canon. Despite these setbacks, Stephane Audran does a superior and sublime job as always. Other far more meaningful and rewarding films by Chabrol: Le Boucher, Les Biches, and Le Femme Infidele. The audio commentary is more interesting than the film itself, so don't miss the audio commentary portion of the DVD if you decide to give this one a try. I threw this one back.",1255910400,3,1293,4.908675799086758
7849550,5,6303495583,"One of Chabrol's most jarring suspense films opens with a shocking scene of domestic violence before settling into a quiet, disturbing tale of moral corruption and wicked duplicity. Audran tweaks our sympathies as the vulnerable young mother who rents a boarding room across from the hospital where her son recuperates, only to find herself isolated and scorned by the elderly female tenants, then manipulated by Cassel's twisted schemes (which involve LSD, porn, and a dim-witted innocent). If this film didn't end on a psychedelic grace note, you could almost call it an experiment in psychological sadism. ""Rupture"" is a Hitchcockian marvel.",1183507200,7,644,5.3861386138613865
7849551,3,6303495583,"Claude Chabrol is often credited as being the French version of Alfred Hitchcock, to some extent that is true, but Chbarol has his own style.

 Chabrol's films are very bubtle. No gratuitous nude scenes, no extreme violence, no explosions, and yet his films linger in your mind. They leave their mark. That's one of the problems I have with this Claude Chabrol film.

 He is too forceful. He doesn't let the material speak for itself. Chabrol is trying too hard to convince us what we are watching is exciting.

 I enjoy the work of Claude Chabrol. He is one of my favorite directors. Of his ""classic"" films I enjoy ""Les Biches""  and ""Le Boucher"" the most, followed by ""The Unfaithful Wife"". They each move at the subtle pace I'm talking about.

 Watch those movies or even Chabrol's most recent ""Merci pour le Chocolat"" and tell me those movies weren't more subtle.

 This film along with ""Innocent With Dirty Hands"" (which I prefer) are almost like ""America"" thrillers. They are much more over-the-top than I find Chabrol's other works.

 ""La Rupture"" starts off with a violent domestic dispute between Helene (Stephane Audran) and Charles (Jean-Claude Drouot). She leaves with her son and decides it's time to get a divorce.

 Charles' parents are upset and decide they will fight back and try to take away all visitation rights from Helene.

 Now Helene has a questionable past and Charles' parents (including Michel Bouquet) send someone to spy on her to get some incriminating evidence. This is all starting to sound like a political witchhunt (Pick your president).

 As I watched ""La Rupture"" my mind kept going back to the first scene. I woundered why did the fight happen. One of the mistakes Chabrol makes is by not giving us enough information about the husband. I thought the husband was just as important as the wife because I thought a dramatic connection would be made between the two and a great secret would be revealed. But Chabrol had other plans and we are left with subtle and mild hints about Charles' past.

 Although I find faults in this film, don't think I'm bashing it. I enjoy the film to some degree. The movie does have some good moments, plus Stephane Audran, as usual, is quite watchable. She does her best to hold the film together.

 ""La Rupture"" perhaps if made by someone else my have impressed me more, but, I know Chabrol's work. I know what he is capable of, and ""La Rupture"", while at times enjoyable, is not his most effective film.

 Bottom-line: Not up to par with Chabrol's other film. Too forceful and ""in your face"". Doesn't have the mysterious touch other films like ""Les Biches"" and ""The Unfaithful Wife"" had.",1098057600,7,2658,4.738562091503268
7849552,5,6303495583,"Excellent Chabrol film --- probably the best introduction to the director.  I'm suprised and very happy that this is out on video at a sell-through price.  For some inexplicable reason, no one seems to talk much about this  film.  It's extremely absorbing and quite beautiful to look at though.  Stephane Audran is particularly charming in this movie, although some have  thought her to be a bit sophisticated for the part.  A silly criticism, I  think.  The colors in this movie are absolutely amazing --- everything  somehow dayglo and hyperrealistic at the same time.  I think Philip K. Dick  fans would in particular get a kick out of this film.  It's organized  similarly to his novels... Everything just gets more and more disjointed  until reality has almost completely broken down.  The denouement is pretty  darned funny, too. A film that more folks should see, it'll add to your  appreciation of Chabrol's other films too.",951350400,20,932,4.980392156862745
