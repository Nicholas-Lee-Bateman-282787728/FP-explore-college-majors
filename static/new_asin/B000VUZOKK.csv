2953648,5,B000VUZOKK,"I have taken four workshops with Mukti so far on Thai massage. I am always able to immediately use what I learn in my practice. My repeat clients often remark on this after I come back from one of his workshops.

The thing I hate about workshops is that you so frequently see much more demonstrated than you can possibly learn and integrate in such a short period of time. Having these DVDs has so increased the value of my workshops with Mukti because I can go back and recover the ""lost"" material, taking the time to integrate it. I also find it refreshes my memory and reenergizes my practice. Mukti demonstrates far more than I could possibly use in a single session, even a 2 hour session. There are hours of asanas clearly demonstrated. It's easy to forget, or neglect a part of this work if you don't regularly use it. Reviewing the DVDs periodically is like finding gold in boxes in your basement!

I have had these DVDs out of the case and into my DVD player more often than any I own. It is possible I have viewed them more times than I've seen ""The Godfather!""

Mukti Rocks! Catch a workshop with him if you can. But regardless, BUY this DVD. It's an incredible investment in your massage career education!",1236211200,3,1217,4.448430493273543
2953649,5,B000VUZOKK,Michael shows you how to develop a wonderful practice of Thai massage on a table. It is great for anyone wanting to create better skills in their own massage practice or for those that have a massage table and wish to expand their knowledge of massage. This DVD will increase your skill level and provide something special for the clients or family members you work on.,1236211200,,369,4.606060606060606
2953650,5,B000VUZOKK,"This 2-DVD set is a great adaptation of Thai-Yoga Massage techniques for use on the massage table.  Practitioners of Swedish, Deep Tissue, and other styles of Table work who wish to incorporate some of Thai-Yoga's stretching and mobilizing benefits should really check this out.  Michael's years of traveling and teaching the Vedic Conservatory Thai-on-the-Table course really show in this masterful set.  Great!",1236211200,6,412,5.612903225806452

8220181,5,B000VUZOKK,Enjoyed this set. Gave me techniques to modify or incorporate into my regular massage sessions to enhance them. Good video quality as well.,1433980800,,139,5.086956521739131
8220182,5,B000VUZOKK,"I bought several Thai Massage dvds but this is the best one. I really really love how Michael ""Mukti"" explained very well every single techniques which is easier for me to understand. This will be a treasure in my library. I watch this dvd almost every single day since i bought it.",1430524800,,282,4.4423076923076925
8220183,4,B000VUZOKK,"The video content is very nice, it is very informative, thank you for the creation of this.  there are 2 DVDs, although the second disk is of a poor quality, the image is kinda blurry, not clear that makes it hard to watch for a long time and you have to make frequent breaks to make your eyes have a rest.",1426809600,,306,4.016393442622951
8220184,5,B000VUZOKK,"Awesome video!!! Always wanted to know how to do Thai on the table .. Easy to follow and very relaxing .. I learned a lot !
I will be using this in my profession as a massage therapist ..",1408924800,,187,3.8205128205128207
8220185,5,B000VUZOKK,"Masterful! Insightful!
Mukti is an Inspiration! His love for Thai massage shows in his work. His instructions and theory are superb! I highly recommend it! When I ordered this DVD Hurricane Sandy had arrived and Mukti emailed me himself to let me know he was in Thailand and hoped everything was alright. As an offering of generosity he even shipped me his other DVD Vedic Thai Yoga as well. As my friend Laura Allen said, ""Best Stretches Ever!""",1354492800,,445,4.717948717948718
8220186,5,B000VUZOKK,Those reviews are very helpful. I love this video! Michael Buck is such a great instructor! Nice and clearly instruction and straight to the point. It's money worth spent!,1323820800,,171,4.931034482758621
8220187,5,B000VUZOKK,Overall very good resource.  It was very instructive and well shot.  It can also help those learning on the mat as well.,1307577600,,120,4.409090909090909
8220188,5,B000VUZOKK,"I have practically worn out this dvd set.  There is no way I would have remembered ALL of the incredible moves, smooth transitions, chakra locations, meridian junctions, body mechanics, sacred history, contraindications, etc, presented in classes.  Even with great handouts and notes some elements escape me, my brain's on overload.  Oh my gosh, this is the best.  Michael respectfully honors approaching,initiating and integrating all levels of the receiver and giver, inspiring his students by his impeccable example. Western and Eastern anatomy is harmoniously presented .  It's a gift to have the workshops at my fingertips to review over and over again.",1239235200,6,658,5.475247524752476
8220189,5,B000VUZOKK,"Living in Southern California, there are a multitude of opportunities to learn different modalities of bodywork.  Having been to Thailand, I wanted to bring the essence of a Thai mat massage to my clients who are not comfortable on the floor.  I bought the DVD hoping to pick up a point or two.  I learned so much more.  It inspired me to take a workshop with Michael.  And the DVD now serves as a memory refresher.

8220190,5,B000VUZOKK,"This is a great bodywork instructional video, used best as an addition to direct instruction by Mukti Michael Buck. In the video, Mukti not only demonstrates the arts effectively, and with great body mechanics, but his verbal comments and guidance add to the completeness of the instruction. In addition, he frames the demonstrations with messages to put the practitioner in the best mental space--a key ingredient to effective practice. The number of techniques demonstrated are more than enough to do a 2 hour treatment. As in many bodywork videos, Mukti demonstrates on a slender and flexible young woman, which helps to make some of the techniques very dramatic. One thing missing that I would like to see is Mukti demonstrating some of the more difficult techniques on a client who is heavy and not very limber.",1236470400,7,816,5.007352941176471
