7986610,3,B00008R9LL,"TLC was a huge group in it's time. T-Boz, Left-Eye & Chilli made over a dozen music videos that left you waiting for more! This was the 1st & 2nd video released from the 2002 Lp ""3D"", which was issued after member Lisa ""Left-Eye"" Lopes died at 30 in a car accident in Honduras. The ""Girl Talk"" video was good, but the animated ""Left-Eye"" was cheesy & not thought out very well. I think the video could have been better if the could have used footage of the real ""Left-Eye"". ""Hands Up"" isn't up to TLC's level. The video makes you think of ""Red Light Special"" Vs ""No Scrubs"", half naked men with a futuristic set! Song wasn't that good & the video is worse. The only ""Left-Eye"" referances are ""Left-Eye"" paintings you get glimpses of throughout the video. Now The Video that should have been included was ""Damaged"" which is the strongest Song/Video that doesn't feature ""Left-Eye"". The song is awesome & so was the video. Hopefully Arista will someday release a complete TLC video compilation, Their 2004 TLC compilation video ""Now & Forever"" falls flat too, it leaves quite a bit out. I've had to go the bootleg route & purchase a complete DVD compilation. The quality was awesome! I guess Arista doesn't think it would sell, who knows?",1351814400,,1236,4.597285067873303
7986611,3,B00008R9LL,"First of all, I love TLC to death. Anything that has to do with them, I'm automatically interested. And I certainly don't mind shelling out money to buy their products, which is why I bought this. But there are three problems with the Hands Up/Girl Talk disc.

The first problem is more of an inherent problem within the group: there's no Lefteye. And no Lefteye means a third of the magic is gone. The 2 videos displayed here obviously show T-Boz and Chilli going through the motions. They were grieving, their heart wasn't in it, and their most interesting partner was no longer there to pick up the slack.

This all means, the videos are not fun to watch. In fact, I believe these are the two worst videos I've ever seen from them.

The second problem is that Damaged is not on the dvd. Why only the first 2 singles. I would have been happy to pay a dollar or two extra if it meant we got all of the videos from the 3D album.

Which leads me to the third and biggest problem: none of us would have had to buy this half-as/sed made dvd if Arista would release a dvd with all of tlc's videos.

I see U2 and Missy Elliot and Madonna and all of these other artists releasing video collections, and I wonder where is tlc's collection. Granted, a dvd was released as a second disc to their imported Hits collection, but all of the videos weren't included, just the videos from their biggest hits.

I recommend Arista get off their butts and pay decent attention to the group that made them A LOT of money in their prime instead of focusing on all of the pretty-faced second tier artists with third tier talent.",1170806400,13,1607,4.357859531772576
