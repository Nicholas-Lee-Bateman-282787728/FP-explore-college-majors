8594141,5,B00DKN111Q,"I went through the whole DVD today and absolutely loved it. He explains every pose step by step and it was really easy for me to keep up. Some of the poses are challenging and I couldn't quite get in position but I've only done yoga a couple times in the past, however not Kemetic Yoga. I just love the fact that I'm able to practice a yoga that aligns with my beliefs and I really don't think I'll try any other yoga besides Kemetic. If you're a beginner like I am, take your time, focus on your breathing (I meditate daily so this wasn't difficult), and enjoy the journey. I plan on doing this evey morning before work until I perfect all poses.",1426464000,2,647,4.225806451612903

8594143,5,B00DKN111Q,"This DVD is a must buy. I enjoy every bit of it. I found myself stretching muscles that I didn't know I had. I always wanted to try yoga and I found the perfect teacher that teaches based on my beliefs. As stated at the beginning of the video, this will not be mastered in one sitting unless you are a pro. Great work. We need more DVDs of your teaching.",1408406400,3,354,4.0
8594144,5,B00DKN111Q,"This is the best DVD on yoga I've ever experienced! Which goes right in line with Yirser Ra Hotep's yoga classes. The DVD is great as a companion to my personal 30 plus years of yoga practice. There are many enlightening nuances that I find each time I review the DVD that also contribute to my 13+ years of teaching yoga. Yet, beginning students who I've shared the DVD with, have found the timeless principles greatly supportive in their practice as well. You won't be disappointed!",1386806400,6,484,4.6395348837209305
8594145,5,B00DKN111Q,"This video is great for any level. As a beginner, it introduced me to authentic Kemetic Yoga with a safe and easy method of movement from one pose to another using the breath. Cosistent practice with this video prepared me well for Master Hotep's teacher certification, and I even used it during that training. It will continue to aid my growing practice as it's a great reminder even for the experienced Kemetic Yoga practitioner.",1377820800,11,431,4.837837837837838
