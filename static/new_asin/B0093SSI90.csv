Worth it when you consider what you can do with that. I bought the DVD region 2 version, popped it in the player and it was ready to go. I just had to locate soundtrack settings (called Idiomas) and chose English sub-titles. The music is great, some scenes are a bit irreverant, but I still like it.",1483056000,,440,4.582278481012659
8535368,5,B0093SSI90,"Imagine if the Breakfast Club had ended with the kids in detention dying in a fire because they couldn't get out of the locked library.  This Spanish (English subtitled) movie is basically the sequel to that.  For twenty years the detention kids have haunted their school (in very amusing ways for we the viewer), but the amount of faculty leaving and the school's reputation isn't looking good for its future.  A new teacher has joined the faculty and after being misdirected to the old library by some of his own class' kids on his first day, he encounters a group of kids picking up chairs and books, waving them in front of him and wondering why he isn't  fleeing out of the room like everyone else in the past has.  The teacher just thinks they're his class, although it's not long before everyone works out, that even though they're dead, he can see them.  The principal quickly works out that if he can see these kids, he can maybe convince them to behave or leave.  Following the age old belief that ghosts linger around the place of their death because they have unfinished business.  The teacher decides to teach and the assess them, so they can pass high school.  Of course they all, aren't really keen on that idea.

Although Spanish the kids unofficially resemble American 80's school kid characters from the Breakfast Club. At one stage they even do the same shuffling feet, twisting bodies dance that is famous from that movie. You've got a jock kid who wears the american jacket with a letter on it.  You've got the leather jacket cares a bit too much about his hair tough guy wannabe character.  You've got the nerdy social outcast.  Another was pregnant when she died, and another drunk, so spews up constantly.

The movie is really funny at the beginning when the ghosts are freaking out victims or having fun messing with their minds.  It's a bit less funny once the teacher discovers them but still entertaining enough from that point on.  There's a bit of possession and a fair few sexual references in some scenes such as nerdy teacher discovers sexting or whatever you call it when it's on a computer between the dead jock and a current student and decides to let her fingers do the walking while reading it.  You've also got some gross toilet paper in a place it shouldn't be during another possession.

The storyline does have some holes such as the kids don't know Spain won the World Cup or hosted the Olympics (they died in 1986) when surely they would know these things as you'd imagine students and teachers in the school they haunt would talk about this, there would be newspapers, radio, TV news stories they would see and things like this.  But none of this makes Ghost Graduation any less fun to watch.  There's plenty of 80's music such as Total Eclipse of the Heart playing throughout the soundtrack as well.

If you're after a fun film and you don't mind reading a good movie, check this out!",1477353600,,2930,4.606936416184971
