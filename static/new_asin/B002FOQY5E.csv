3923807,5,B002FOQY5E,"As with most of the Japanese action movies, this didn't disappoint.  Great action movie, but that was all some of these movies need better scripts.",1319155200,,147,4.88
3923808,5,B002FOQY5E,"This can be viewed as a ""live action cartoon movie"" along the line of other movies like street fighter if you are into this then you definitely will enjoy this movie if not you may want to steer clear",1307232000,3,200,4.153846153846154
3923809,3,B002FOQY5E,"When average, everyday high school student Rika and her friend decide to skip classes and take a train to visit her grandfather, she was unaware that his remote village was infected with the living dead. As soon as they arrive, they're tossed into a nest of flesh-eating fiends as they desperately attempt to avoid becoming lunch while trying to get to Grandpa's, who fortunately  happens to be a great surgeon, but unfortunately, unbeknownst to Rika, also happens to have Alzheimer's... ain't life grand?

So, over the river and through the woods to grandfather's house they go. Once there, the zombie's follow suit, and poor Rika gets bitten by a girl-eating ghoul in a melee that occurs in Grandpa's pad, and her arm is amputated to spare her the fate of becoming infected. She later gets a transplant arm, courtesy of a fallen #1 Zombie-Hunter, and that arm comes with a complimentary Samurai Sword and a side-dish of special powers, and now the real blood-letting begins! Rather than bore you with annoying details and spoilers, here's the pros and cons of this low-budget Asian gorefest -

  1) The story and characters are paper-thin, at times ridiculous, but this is a zombie flick, not Shakespeare.

  2) In spite of the non-existent budget, the zombies look pretty damn cool, and the effects with flesh-eating,  intestinal buffets, throat-tearing snacks and blood-letting kills are very good and near-believable. (Assuming you buy into the whole zombie thing in the first place).

  3) Killing zombies with samurai swords looks like a helluva lot of fun, and would make a great sport. Certainly an improvement over Nascar racing, I assure you.

  4) Just like their human counterparts, zombies aren't terribly trustworthy in a pinch, and not all of them are as stupid as they look.

  5) The main evil Overlord zombie villain looks like some schmuck in a Halloween costume at a local Haunted House.

6) Just when you think the producers have copped out and delivered an obligatory Happy Ending (no, not that kind, the other kind), we get a nice but simple twist that almost salvages this film.

So, there you have it - if you dig zombie flicks, truckloads of arterial blood-spray, and want to kick back for a few laughs with a few pints with a few friends and a ton of gore, go for it, you might be pleasantly and sufficiently amused. Otherwise, why are you still reading this???",1286841600,6,2389,4.83743842364532
3923810,4,B002FOQY5E,"This well cast low budget, silly and goofy Zombie movie has actually got some chops to it - the fight scenes are actually pretty good and the film has a strong lead actress and a good diverse cast of oddities for the background.  The director does a stand up job executing the scenes of action with the limited budget and I liked the traditional Japanese folk music played as OST.  Fun and entertaining and fans of films like Tokyo Gore Police or Machine Girl will dig this.  Nudity = check.  Swearing = check.  Gore=eh, a little.  Blood = hell yeah and a lot of it.  Glad I bought this, glad to have it in my collection.  You like goofy Japanese Zombie fare - then this is for you!",1260403200,15,682,4.2734375
3923811,3,B002FOQY5E,"When it comes to Japanese approach to zombies, many people can think towards video games such as ""Resident Evil"" (Biohazard) or even creepy monster like video games such as ""Silent Hill"".  When it comes to the films, where Western films tend to want to feature more gore, humor but retain that creepiness and eeriness, sometimes that Japanese direction of zombie films tend to want to titillate the viewer.

With the release of ""Attack Girls' Swim Team versus the Undead"" (aka ""Nihonbi 2'), the film utilized porno actresses and thus the film seemed very softcore despite being a zombie film.  And not exactly scary or eery but more comic and sexual in nature.  Now we have the followup titled ""Zombie Hunter Rika: Unrated Limited Edition"" (aka ""Nihonbi 3') from Switchblade Pictures.  This time, minus the porn stars and higher production, we get bikini model Risa Kudo as Zombie Hunter Rika.

The film revolves around a scientific program gone haywire.  While the emergency sounds are blaring in the background, the main scientist seemed to have slept after having an erotic dream after looking at a porn magazine.  When he wakes up, he finds out that his colleagues are now zombies and instead of running away, he looks at his comrades in the eye and ends up being bit by one and thus becoming a zombie.

We then see the exploits of a European wandering zombie hunter via a streaming video clip that a guy is watching on his computer.  But somehow in this film, the main protagonist is defeated by a huge zombie monster which ends with the hero's arm being cutoff (and evidently, the hero is killed).  We then see the monster take the cut off arm (which is still holding the sword) and throwing it towards the forest.  It appears that this was not a fake movie but a real clip that had happened.

Enter Rika and her high school classmate and BFF Nami as they ride in the subway and talk about Rika's grandfather who is a skilled surgeon who moved away and Rika still missing him.  The two suddenly have an idea to run away and visit her grandfather Ryuhei at his summerhouse.  We then see the grandfather who seems to be an invalid and just sits down with hardly any movement.  A woman named Sayaka is seen taking care of him and happy that her brother is to be coming to visit.

While at this village, we see Rika and her friend at the village and come face to face with a zombie.  The town seems to be filled with zombies and now Rika and Nami try to run away and encounter some gangster guy named Tomoya.  The three are then chased by zombies and end up escaping together and go to the summer home where Rika's grandfather is at. Meanwhile at the village in which zombies are growing and growing, three guys (who are like the comedy support of the film) try to find a way to escape the village.

The three managed to make it to the village and we learn that Sayaka is the wife of Rika's grandfather and Tomoya is her brother (fake).  Sayaka explains to her that her grandfather has Alzheimer's and Dementia but in truth, it was a plot by Sayaka and her boyfriend Tomoya to get money from Rika's grandfather and plans to kill him off in order to get the insurance money.

But not all is good at the summer home of Rika's grandfather as the zombies have made their way into the residence and all of a sudden we learn that Rika's grandfather is well and pretending he was sick.  While everyone tries to fight off the zombies, Rika is bitten in the arm.  For Rika's grandfather, being the master surgeon that he is, knowing that a zombies bite can turn a person to a zombie, the only way to save her is to chop off her arm and replace her arm with... the original zombie hunter's arm.

Also, arriving to the residence is the original scientist who was responsible in everyone turning to a zombie.  Supposedly, despite now being a zombie, he has resisted his zombie urges and wants to help Rika and everyone.

Now, everyone tries to fight off the zombies and find the one major zombie monster (the one who killed the original zombie killer) and supposedly, if they kill him...everyone will return back to normal.  Meanwhile, American forces are set to drop a nuclear bomb on the zombie infested village.  Can Rika and friends defeat the zombie monster in time?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Zombie Hunter Rika"" is presented in 16:9 and for the most part, similar to ""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus the Undead"", you can tell the video is shot digitally.  But the main difference between both films is that there is higher production value with this film compared to the other.  This time, there are a lot of zombies and you see them walking through the cities of a village.  More zombies visually eating human body parts but most of all, more scene locations and shots in various areas.  Where the last film was confined to a school, we see the talent in the film in a variety of locations.

As for audio, audio is still in Japan 2.0 stereo.  So, front channel driven but I preferred to have my receiver set with stereo on all channels but for the most part, the film is dialogue driven.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Zombie Hunter Rika: Unrated Limited Edition"" comes with only trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Japanese zombie films, I suppose it depends on the viewer what they want to see more.  More sex or more gore?  If there was one thing that ""Zombie Hunter Rika"" needed, was better and higher production and for the most part, you do get that.  Personally, I felt ""Zombie Hunter Rika"" was much better than ""Attack Girls' Swim Team versus the Undead"" because there is actually a plot and there are more scene locations and more zombies.

Granted, this film is nowhere near the production value of a Hollywood zombie film but still, there is a good amount of humor, sex and of course gore to make ""Zombie Hunter Rika"" enjoyable in some ways.  For those who are familiar with the anime or manga series ""Blackjack"" (a story about a doctor who has the ability to save anyone, even through bizarre surgery), it's interesting to see that character in Grandpa Ryuhei and the fact that he also happens to be a kick butt samurai.

But of course seeing the original zombie hunter arm on Rika looks pretty much fake, the film does have its share of disgusting moments and as for the sex scenes, unlike ""Attack Girls' Swim Team versus the Undead"" which utilized porn stars to make the sex scenes much more realistic (although not much is shown), the most you will get in this film are three maids who want to show off who has the biggest breasts and one of the supporting characters topless.  The film relies less on sex and more on fighting or getting eaten by zombies.

So, overall ""Zombie Hunter Rika"" still manages to be laughable and humorous in some parts but you also get a good amount of gore (again, I emphasize that this film is not that scary at all but some parts are a bit creepy) and maintains that Japanese zombie humor as well.  Definitely not a dark and twisted film but much better in execution and higher budget in production but less sex than the previous film.

If you are a fan of Japanese zombie films, then definitely give ""Zombie Hunter Rika"" a chance.",1255996800,15,7190,4.529821843532146

3923830,3,B002FOQY5E,"Japanese filmmakers tend to apply different sensibilities to the zombie genre, which can make evaluating them by Western standards a senseless exercise.  Although it starts out with a typical outbreak of the walking dead, Zombie Hunter Rika (2008) soon adds some quirky elements that are primarily associated with the Japanese culture.  With a samurai sword being employed against the undead, the film has a decent level of gore, and also some gratuitous nudity, in this horror/comedy where a schoolgirl battles to save her friends and family.  Some spoilers follow.

While in a village, students Rika (Risa Kudo) and Nami encounter a group of zombies, but manage to escape with the help of a passerby.  The group goes to Rika grandfather's house, but the zombies soon appear there, kill a number of people, and trap the survivors in the house.

Rika is bitten on the arm by a zombie, and to save her life, her grandfather Ryuhei, a noted surgeon, cuts off her arm, and attaches a severed arm gripping a sword, that belonged to a man who was a ""zombie hunter"".  Rika finds that the sword is special, and that in hands of the original owner, Rika is capable of great fighting skills.

Takashi, a ""friendly"" zombie appears in the house, and tells the survivors that if Grorian the boss of the zombies is defeated, everything will return to ""normal"".  The group heads into the woods, bound for Grorian's lair, and while traveling, they are attacked by zombies, and Rika gets the chance to employ her new zombie fighting skills.  Eventually Rika has a showdown with the hideous looking Grorian (a huge guy wearing a white rubber mask).

The zany plot of Zombie Hunter Rika may leave some a bit bewildered, but the gore effects might be enough to satisfy those looking for a little zombie killing action, as a samurai sword is an effective weapon against slow moving zombies.

The quality of zombie makeup effects varies, and sometimes isn't very convincing, but other practical gore effects, like a tongue removal and a neck bite, are very nicely done.  Mostly played for laughs, some of the action scenes are decent, while others, like the battle with Grorian, seem clumsy or pretentious.  If you make a strong connection with the characters, the ""twist"" ending may affect how you feel about the movie.  For those who are less concerned, it could be just the last in a string of bizarre plot developments.  Rating: 2.5 stars.

If a sword swinging Japanese schoolgirl doesn't perk your interest, then pass on this one.  If you're acquainted with Asian horror, the gore and crazy humor may have some appeal.  In any case, while it is available to Prime members, it won't cost you anything but time, to see what the movie is about.",1345852800,,2725,4.796573875802998
3923831,1,B002FOQY5E,"I don't expect a zombie movie to be perfect, but I couldn't get through this one without fast fowarding.  The biggest issue was total lack of common sense.  Yeah, it's a movie so you expect that some liberties will be taken, but when a guy squeezes off about 30 rounds with a six shooter it's just TOO illogical.  The production quality was poor, the story jumps around, the actors are annoying.  I just didn't enjoy it, and I like a lot of cheesy zombie flicks.  If you have a Japanese fetish maybe you'll like it, but otherwise I would skip it.",1343692800,,546,4.366336633663367

However I cant get over the fact that I sat there through half the WHOLE MOVIE JUST TO GET TO RIKA KILLING THEM!!! SUPER BUMMER! I did however like the fight scenes. Pretty choppy but still good. Don't get me wrong but Japanese actors...are really really bad. Surprisingly the actor who played as Rika did pretty good, She wasn't annoying like all the other girls I saw. She is one awesome girl.

8369461,4,B002FOQY5E,"This movie that proves when it comes to comedy/horrors with awful scripts, high-school special effects, and bad acting from beautiful, buxom young ladies, the Japanese definitely do not take a back seat to their counterparts in Hong Kong. Risa Kudo stars as Rika, whose surgeon grandfather grafts the right arm of a fearless zombie hunter to her, thus transforming her into one herself. Throughout the whole movie, she doesn't strip past her school uniform, so she may have been chosen for the role due to her acting abilities, which, comparatively, aren't that bad. JAV actress Tsugumi Nagasawa (formerly known as Asami Tachibana) plays Rika's grandfather's wife, Sayaka Shiratori, who schemes with her boyfriend to kill the old man so that she can inherit all he owns. She also provides the film with some titillating scenes. (Pun intended.) Tsugumi's other splatter movie credits include Tokyo Gore Police (2008) and Grotesque (2009). One notable scene in the move is where the three maids at Rika's grandfather's mansion (played by Akina Serizawa, Mina Arai, and Lemon Hanazawa) are interrupted by one of the flesh-eating ghouls while comparing boobs with each other.
