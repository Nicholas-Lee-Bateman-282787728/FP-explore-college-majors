8029678,1,B0002NY8OE,"I enjoy older black and white movies, mostly from about 1935 to 1950, and especially those with a great storyline yet lacking the blood and language issues so common since the 1970's in most things that come from Hollywood.
What's in the box is supposed to be ""Borderline"", ""Nancy Drew - Reporter"", ""Thirteenth Guest"" and ""A Shriek In The Night"", what I got were two copies of ""Thirteenth Guest and A Shriek In The Night"" - that's right, two disc two's. Both starring Ginger Rogers.
Right away the set lost two stars.
The quality of the DVD's was poor, my main DVD player, which seems to even work with things the dog chewed, refused point blank with both discs. I took it to the one in the bedroom which is multi region and it played fine - is this set designed for another country? I don't know - it just wouldn't play on the USA only player. Another point gone.
The quality was also average to poor, obviously from the half set I recieved just transferred from old film reels with little or any attempt to clean them up. Another point gone.
The sad thing is the two movies I'd really have liked to see are the two I didn't get, and the two I did get feature Ginger Rogers more in a screaming victim role (Thirteenth Guest) than a worthwhile detective (It's better in ""A Shriek In The Night"").
If I'd gotten the whole set and the quality been up to par on the other two I'd possibly have given four stars (only because this is what I enjoy) but never five, and more likely three.",1291680000,,1481,4.350180505415162
