2043144,4,B0001Y9U9W,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it would have been better with less singing. Tommy Emmanuel fans want to hear him play. Having said that, if you like Tommy Emmanuel, you'll like this DVD. The extras give some insight into his personality.

2043146,4,B0001Y9U9W,"I have not yet seen Tommy Emmanuel live but after this concert DVD I want to more than ever.  It's ""like being there,"" almost.  He exudes such passion and joy for the music--voice and instrument--that he woos one over and over.  It seems obvious he was born to do what he does on the concert hall stage.  I favor live performance recordings because of the energy generated by the audience-performer give and take.  One little technical complaint, as I recall (it's been a while since I played the disc) in one or more sections I had to turn the volume all the way up to get full benefit of the lyrics.",1167955200,2,601,4.378378378378378
2043147,5,B0001Y9U9W,For Tommy Emmanuel fans this is a must have.  This video show Tommy at is best and displays all of his playing styles.  For anyone wanting to see how Tommy plays this is the one to buy.  Great entertainment!,1162771200,2,207,4.256410256410256

2043149,5,B0001Y9U9W,"Tommy Emmanuel is not only an extremely gifted finger-style guitarist, he's a first rate showman who enjoys his own show nearly as much as the audience.  If you can't see him play live, this is really the next-best thing to being there.  The show runs the gamut from fresh arrangements of old standbys to intriguing original compositions, and not a clunker in the bunch.",1142208000,6,370,4.765625

This DVD will bring you endless times of joy and admiration, and also for people like me that actually play guitars themselves it's a bottomless source of inspiration.

This is the DVD you should have bought yesterday!

2043151,5,B0001Y9U9W,"Great concert Dvd. When I tell people about Tommy Emmanuel, they often ask, ""Who?"" Once they've seen him live or on Dvd, they are instant fans and can't get enough of him. I've had the privilege of seeing him perform live and on several concert tapes; there aren't words to describe how good this guy is. I also met him backstage at two of his concerts and he is one of the warmest and most generous people I've ever met. A remarkable individual and talent.",1346976000,4,457,4.3882352941176475
2043152,5,B0001Y9U9W,"Settle down in something comfortable with something cold and be prepared to be entertained by one of the truly great solo acoustic guitar players to walk the planet.  Tommy plays tunes with melodies whilst adding touches of genius, impeccable phrasing and timing.  He plays as clean as a whistle encompassing every trick with a great tone.  Tommy is a great communicator and displays real joy in his playing which comes across and adds so much to his performance.  It's a shame that his conversations have been edited but I'm guessing at just short of 2 hours they felt it necessary.  In a world full of technology it's so great to see one man and his acoustic guitar produce so much.  Oh and there's something for the drummers too when Tommy unleashes some crazy rhythms utilizing every bit of his guitar.  So it's a thumbs up (no pun intended)!",1340668800,2,846,4.675675675675675
2043153,5,B0001Y9U9W,"Tommy Emmanuel is the best acoustic guitarist in the world today. This DVD does a good job of showcasing one of his recorded performances. If you get a chance to see him live *DO*! If you don't, buy some of his DVDs at least, and not only *listen* but watch an excellent performer in action!",1336176000,2,291,4.3090909090909095
2043154,4,B0001Y9U9W,"I saw this amazing GUITAR-god 14 May 2007 here in SWEDEN in the little town called Gvle, I couldn't understand why this artist visit my little hometown (200 km north of Stockholm), but I thought one must support these kinda things...
I was totally floored by this concert, what a PERFORMER, and you gotta love his jaw-dropping technique that he also includes into his humor so we can laugh our asses off...and this DVD really remindes me of that specific concert (keep in mind that I've seen this man several times by now)...

A few weeks later I found this DVD on the net and purchased it (my first ever TE item), and this is by far Tommy Emmanuel's BEST DVD, it has better songs, like his best version of ""Guitar Boogie"" (plus no singin'), and completes the whole thingy with that awesome drum-solo as a BIG surprise ;) too...

And I do not agree with ""Jeff Hall"" (and ""Timothy A. Di Pietro"") at all, despite the fact that he's right about the sound quality though (there for the 4 stars), the performens on this DVD is outstanding and I think he is never gonna top this one (pity), this performens is top-notch man...
It's a ""must have"" (a ""buy or die"")!!!

2043155,5,B0001Y9U9W,"Yes, some of the other Tommy DVDs offer better quality images, but this DVD documents a superlative and comprehensive overview of Tommy's amazing chops and his lovingly-crafted songs.  Two thumbs(and a pinkie) way, way up!!!!",1299542400,2,225,5.428571428571429
2043156,5,B0001Y9U9W,"This DVD is awesome.  If you've never seen or heard of Tommy Emmanuel, you are in for a treat.  I truly believe he is the best guitarist in the world. I highly recommend this DVD.",1295827200,,179,4.085714285714285
2043157,3,B0001Y9U9W,"Speaking from the viewpoint of being a HUGE Tommy fan as well as a professional music producer, video producer and performing guitarist of almost 4 decades, I will share that this DVD was disappointing to me.  Tommy is fabulous on it - of that make no mistake.  However, the production quality, especially the audio is disappointing.  If you own all the other Tommy DVDs then buy this one to complete your collection.  If you are looking for good Tommy stuff, then I suggest one of the others.  TE Live at Her Majesty's Theater in Ballarat is good although the up close camera work is too 'rock 'n' roll' for my taste. (I just directed and shot a four camera live rock n roll concert last night, so I am not against the style at all - it's just not well suited for Tommy in my professional opinion.)  So what is my complaint against the audio for this DVD?  A fair amount actually - there is no selection for Dolby etc compared to the other I just mentioned which gives you options including DTS - (Hooray)  and the overall sound is not Tommy's signature 'bigger than life' sound.  It is rather ambient in quality which takes a lot of the impact away from it. Tommy  has done a marvelous job of getting an acoustic  guitar with pickups installed to sound very close to a mic'ed sound but bigger than life - lots of EQ etc which is his signature sound.  This DVD comes nowhere close to that which is a disappointment if you are expecting typical TE bigness.

Just picked up ""Tommy Emmanuel Center Stage"" two nights ago at his concert and expect that to be fantastic - haven't yet had a chance to sit down and enjoy.  It is his latest which probably means it will have all the bells and whistles. ...and yes, as always, the concert was off-the-hook-fantastic!",1283731200,4,1757,4.45
2043158,5,B0001Y9U9W,This performance is awesome. Tommy is one of the best musicians walking the Earth today. Trust me.....buying this dvd is money well spent. You will enjoy this show tremendously. So much talent and dedication in this man. I'm glad he is sharing his music with the world. I'm going to see him live this coming Feb.,1257811200,2,312,4.589285714285714
2043159,5,B0001Y9U9W,"This was a new twist in our entertainment with music by Tommy.  He's talented, very amusing, and very professional in his artistic animation.  We loved it and shared it  with our family especially our grandson who is in the process of replacing his guitar  with a new state of the art acoustic guitar.  In fact Tommy's dvd(for training purposes), and the new guitar is his birthday gift from grandpa and grandma.

With pleasure,

2043160,5,B0001Y9U9W,"This DVD was suggested to me by a friend after she'd heard me play.  I sort of took it as a compliment.  ""Oh, she's interested in my playing and wants to show me this dude that she thinks I might like...""  Well, no.  She was clearly trying to kill, shame and embarrass me because this video is heart-stopping, head-spinning and life-affirming all at once.  And it will short circuit your brain!  But in a really good way, I assure you.

This is clearly one of the best overall performances I've ever seen.  If you enjoy guitar virtuosity, if you enjoy unique takes on some classic rock/pop (and original tunes), if you can appreciate true guitar talent when you see it (and even if you're a casual listener who enjoys a unique performance), this video will definitely not disappoint.",1239321600,2,783,4.6231884057971016
2043161,5,B0001Y9U9W,"If you're looking at this, you probably already know that Tommy Emmanuel is a consummate guitarist's guitarist.  I had the pleasure of catching him in a fairly small venue, and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen.  Besides being an incredible player, he's fun and he hooks right up with the audience.  This DVD does a pretty good job of conveying the feeling of a concert like that one.  Don't expect fancy lighting or staging, but be prepared to shake your head in amazement, especially if you're a player.  This one also has, I think, a particularly good selection of pieces.  There's a reason that you'll rarely, if ever, see a used copy of this disc for sale.",1232236800,2,674,4.528925619834711
2043162,5,B0001Y9U9W,"I read an article about Tommy In Guitar Player magazine and decided to take a chance on buying one of his DVD's after watching a few performances on [...]. He is truly an amazing talent. It's too bad that the current state of radio airplay doesn't allow artists such as Tommy Emanuel exposure to listeners. While I really enjoyed Tommy's original compositions, its his covers that really rock. Mason Williams ""Classical Gas"" really gets a shot of steroids! I highly recommend this to any fans of acoustic guitar virtuosos.",1226361600,4,522,4.876404494382022
2043163,5,B0001Y9U9W,Tommy Emmanuel is extremely entertaining.  I truly enjoyed the entire concert.  I was pleasantly surprised by the intimacy of the setting and the number of pieces played.  Anyone who enjoys listening to guitar will be impressed.,1224374400,,228,5.277777777777778

2043166,5,B0001Y9U9W,"The five star rating is for the performance. I give no stars to the production of this disc. I find it hard to believe that this is the best Mel Bey could do for this concert. Obviously, this was dubbed in someone's garage studio using a VHS copy and put on DVD. They didn't even take the VHS disclaimer off the end of the tape. No liner notes, no extras and no special sound.
Now, I play guitar. Well, I used to think I could play guitar, until I saw this man play. My friend and I, (also a player) just sat and watched Tommy play, both mezmerized by his skill. After the concert was over,we just sat there in amazement. I have always liked this finger picking style made popular by Chet Atkins. Tommy has taken it to another level. There are no words to explain his ability. Just buy this disc and perpare to be entertained. Not only by his playing ability but the joy he exudes when he is entertaining the audience. Every song is a gem, but my favorite on this DVD is Initiation, a combination of percussion, and sounds and guiter, --enthralling! I found out later that Tommy was completely exhausted when he did this concert. He had to reach down deep to do this concert. The result was magic.",1192406400,16,1197,4.3244444444444445

2043169,3,B0001Y9U9W,"I gave this concert only 3 stars in sharp contrast to its other reviews on Amazon..... I did it for one reason: Tommy's phrasing/riffs (in this concert) were not as crisp and articulate as he can be .

Tommy is a brilliant player. He is also one of the most effervescent entertainers in the field today. Afterall, Chet Atkins didn't label him ""certified guitar player"" and ""the greatest living guitar player"" without good reason....

Tommy's ability to captivate an audience is masterful. He plays without accompaniment in most instances... Not so much as a bass player.... and he pulls it off like no one (except maybe Victor Borge) ever has.... He can be hysterically funny, innovative, light hearted and extemporaneous... He is really one of the finest entertainers ever....

But in this concert, I felt disappointed that Tommy's riffs were not up to snuff.... They lacked the articulate, crisp and precise execution that I've grown to expect from a truly world-class player.... Dare I say it? He was even a little bit sloppy...although a non player may not even hear it.

This concert simply was not his best.... In fact, some of the clips available on You Tube show a greater variety and quality of musicality than this concert .....

Tommy, I love you ta' death...... But..............well, you know.

8018191,5,B0001Y9U9W,"This is an earlier video of Tommy E's fantastic guitar playing from his slightly younger days.  The sound quality is pretty good but the video quality is closer to VHS quality.  Editing is a little crude but you hardly notice it while focused on Tommy.  There is plenty of interaction between Tommy and the audience during the first half of the video but during the second half, that looks edited out.  There are no video extras but the main video is a hair under 2 hours long.  Tommy doesn't have guests join him or do much singing.  He sings once and does a great job.  His guitar sound system is a little primitive compared to later DVDs and he does a lot of adjusting and guitar tuning.  The sound level starts a little low but gets turned up after a few minutes so don't turn your volume up to quick.  There are a lot of tunes on this video that are not on his later videos and very few that are.  He plays them the same both times!  He even gives a short guitar lesson that was interesting.  With all the vintage weaknesses of this video, it still earns nothing less than 5 stars. This video is longer than later videos and contains more music.  If you enjoy one of his later DVDs, this one is just as good and maybe a little better due to it's length.  He was born a guitar master.  Highly recommended",1447372800,2,1308,4.260162601626016
