8147625,3,B000IW8MBY,"I bought this cause I like their songs, especially People Like Me (not included hear), Walk on Water, New Body, Get Down.  All of these are not included either.  The camera flashes all over the place, kind of annoying.  The worse part is that the songs are basically re-interpreted in a ""screaming, growling"" tone, grating to the ears.  I give it 3 stars only because there is nothing offensive, as there shouldn't be from a ""Christian"" band, lyrically.  Although you wouldn't know they were Christian if you didn't know it going in.  I wouldn't recommend it.",1271894400,,559,4.770833333333333
