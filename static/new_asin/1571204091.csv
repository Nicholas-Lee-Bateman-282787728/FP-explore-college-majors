I would recommend this book to all who would like to learn to paper piece.",1252713600,2,254,4.183673469387755
188134,5,1571204091,"Carol Doak's patterns are great, and all of her books explain things very clearly. However, having this DVD is like having Carol herself and her wonderful sense of humor in your home to teach you how to paper piece. Not only that, but she also teaches how to minimize the fabric waste that so many of us used to complain about when paper piecing. With this DVD, some of Carol's patterns and her paper (it prints beautifully and tears off so easily), you'll be all set.",1216512000,8,468,4.453488372093023

7797255,5,1571204091,"I'm not inclined to write reviews about the things I purchase on Amazon but, for this DVD I will make an exception.  I have never paper pieced before and wanted to learn.  This DVD provided all the information I needed  to start.  My first block came out perfectly thanks to the information in the DVD.  Carol Doak is very approachable she makes it easy and fun to learn.  I just can't say enough good things about it. Excellent would be an understatement!",1349136000,2,456,4.5
7797256,3,1571204091,"I watched the dvd waiting to see how to finish the quilt. The dvd did not teach me how to finish the quilt. I am a first time quilter and I had already seen videos on how to paper piece. But this dvd was supposed to have a part in it that showed how to finish off the quilt. I was looking to see how to put batting and back on and there was nothing in the dvd that showed how. If you want to learn to paper piece this is ok but you better know how to do all the rest cause this won't show you.
kinda disappointed so I sent the dvd back.",1346457600,,536,3.6695652173913045

7797258,5,1571204091,I took a class on paper piecing wanting to learn how to accomplish an easy way on obtaining sharp & precise points in quilting.  By the time the class was finished we were all confused about which way the fabric went etc.  It was very frustrating. Carol's dvd was excellant on breaking down each step on doing paper piecing.  She gives great tips & making things easy.  I recommend using this dvd instead of taking a class unless the class instructor is very proficient at paper piecing.  A must have for beginner piecers or those who need a refresher.,1308960000,5,552,4.5353535353535355
7797259,5,1571204091,"Carol Doak is a gem.  This instructional DVD keeps it to the basics which, for me, was EXACTLY what I needed.  With fabric on one side and lines on the other I was having a difficult time wrapping my brain around the simplicity of the process.  I am new to paper piecing so, in this dvd, Carol takes the viewer step by step in creating paper pieced blocks.  Carol also shows hints for connecting blocks.  I will go back to it time and again.  Thank you Carol!",1292716800,6,459,4.218390804597701
