8274028,1,B0019H6IWW,"Not my Type of anime. My friend said I should get this since I love Azumanga then I would love this series. Well I freakin love Azumanga but I think Cromartie High School is really bad. So many reviews gave this a 5/5 even off of amazon. Iv'e never read the manga before but its just completely random and so boring to me. Anyways I got up to episode 21 but it took alot just to get that far. If you like Random Stuff that isn't that funny then i recommend this. If your looking for a good comedy I recommend Azumanga, Pani Poni Dash, Lucky Star, Or Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu. I am sorry if anyone was mad at my review who thought this is a really good anime. I just don't understand what make this good.",1290211200,4,704,4.108695652173913
8274029,2,B0019H6IWW,"I just received this yesterday excited that this was volume two of the series yet when I opened it and saw the first episode of it, it was the exact thing I had.  I had the original complete collection and thought after looking over the box and seeing the name Vol. 2 that it was an additional group.  If you have the complete collection blue box do not get this, it is a waste of money.  I love the series and has wished it to be true that this was the second batch but alast, not.",1216684800,11,482,4.0
