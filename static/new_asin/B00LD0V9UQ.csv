6479809,4,B00LD0V9UQ,Mystery Road is a modern Western filmed on a small Australian wasteland town. An aboriginal rookie policeman investigates a murder unveiling latent racism and corruption. This is an above average indie Western with solid acting. It is also an intelligent commentary on contemporary rural poverty.,1413849600,,296,5.6
6479810,5,B00LD0V9UQ,"I have to confess up front the only reason I wanted to see MYSTERY ROAD is because Hugo Weaving and Ryan Kwanten are in it.  The plot sounded good, however I wanted to see the mentioned actors in other roles besides those they are most popular for (i.e. Jason from TRUE BLOOD, Agent Smith from THE MATRIX, etc.).  But wow, I got so much more than I was expecting.  This film is a top-notch, well made thriller that will keep you guessing.

There are so many things to like about this movie.  It is shot very well, and the cinematography does a great job of capturing the isolated yet beautiful landscape of Australia.  This particular aspect alone is enough to make me recommend this film.  But theres much more about it to appreciate.

The acting in MYSTERY ROAD is excellent, with Aaron Pederson leading up a stellar cast.  Ive never seen Pedersons work before, however he is a major talent.  And, as expected, Weaving and Kwanten do not disappoint; both are at the top of their game in this film.  I am also excited to see Bruce Spence onscreen.  Ive enjoyed his work since THE ROAD WARRIOR, way back in the early 80s.

But the biggest winner for me is the story.  With a tone reminiscent of TRUE DETECTIVE, the case of the murdered girl unfolds with craftsman-like precision.  And when things really get going, the intensity never lets up.  The conclusion wraps up nicely, however I do not want to mention any specific details.  This is a film you definitely must see to appreciate.

MYSTERY ROAD is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Some viewers might find the Australian accents a bit thick, so subtitles might be a good idea here and there.  But definitely check this one out soon.",1413763200,13,1700,4.511475409836065
6479811,5,B00LD0V9UQ,Deep character development and a very good old school mystery.  One of the best shoot outs done.  You should watch.,1413676800,2,115,4.7
6479812,5,B00LD0V9UQ,"This film will have you wondering who are the good guys and the bad ones, even within the police department! There's a mystery brewing in a small town and when a police officer returns to the force (after a short absence), he'll have to figure out who his friends really are. The shootout at the end of the film is one of the most realistic I've seen in a film in quite some time. Don't wait to discover the secrets of ""Mystery Road""!",1412208000,7,434,4.240963855421687
6479813,5,B00LD0V9UQ,"The opening sequence of a truck against the flat plain of an outback sunrise sets the tone of what is to come. It does not hold back in portraying life in remote Australia turning in on itself, although this story lacks the generosity which also runs through such communities. The acting is terse, intense and dialogue sparse. Best of all it leaves the viewer to absorb the picture created by the details. Aaron Pedersen holds down the main role, uncompromising, it resonates with ghosts, of the past colliding with the present-it is almost like a Western such as ""Unforgiven"" in the starkness and morality of the tale. But on every level it works. The cinematography feeds the senses, the story is gritty but engaging. It is not clean narrative but rather continues to run through you even as the credits roll. My one criticism is the climatic scene and a certain lack of credibility-the protagonist appears to be shot in the arm but frames later, driving the car and moving about freely...you wonder if the director missed a continuity issue.",1411862400,16,1044,4.805555555555555
6479814,4,B00LD0V9UQ,"The movie itself is slow paced, which I don't mind. But....it's a bit confusing at times. I couldn't really recommend this for entertainment....But it's got a great cast and great acting. I was going to give it 3 stars. But I tell you, this movie has one of the best shootouts I've ever seen. If only for that reason, this movie is worth watching. I like this type of film, I was rooting to enjoy it. But I was left feeling underwhelmed aside from the amazing gun play at the end. Just give it a watch. Maybe you'll understand it and like it more than I did.",1410652800,13,558,4.224299065420561
6479815,3,B00LD0V9UQ,"A young indigenous girl, Julie Mason is found with her throat cut at Massacre Creek on Mystery Road. So much for covert symbolism. Indigenous Detective Jay (Aaron Penderson) is tasked with finding the murderer. His police Sargent is limited on resources. Jay discovers numerous clues. The girl would frequent trucker drivers for money to buy drugs. There is a farmer nearby who dislikes blames locals for trying to steal from him. After he talks to her mom, she leaves town. Julie's best friend Toni won't talk to the police. And Jay discovers Julie's cell phone has numerous calls made to his daughter. An hour into the film, the whole town is suspect, more clues are being added and another murder from a year ago may be connected.

The acting was decent in this made for Australian TV film, but the film was too long with a plot that developed too slowly. After an hour I was wondering if the film was ever going to end. Worth a view for those who have two hours to kill for a crime drama mystery.

6479830,3,B00LD0V9UQ,"Jay Swan(Aaron Pedersen) Aussie police detective, is stuck in the middle between two sides, his own native culture and white society, mistrusted by both. A young Aboriginal girl has been found murdered in a highway drain. Hell have to go it alone,hes told by his chief(Tony Barry) for whats considered a low priority case. This Stetson-wearing cop is like the lone gunman cleaning up a corrupt community. Mystery Roads writer-director writes a lot from his own early experiences, mining the festering racism beneath the matey surface. Were in the Queensland outback of wide open plains, and dusty roads. The threat of violence hangs in the air and paranoia is behind every stare. There is a stark, unforgiving beauty in the cinematography. There is a quality of menace as in Sayless Lone Star.

Jay learns that July Mason was hooked on drugs and used to have sex with truck drivers for money. He discovers she was texting his teenage daughter Crystal. He visits Crystal and his estranged alcoholic wife Mary, but makes little headway. Some strange plot holes open up like pot-holes in the road. The race of wild superdogs, the recent killing of a young white cop( possibly by a colleague) are introduced and left hanging. The behaviour of Jays colleagues, Johnno(Weaver)and Robbo arouses his suspicions. Jay arrests a police informer Wayne, only to be told to lay off him. Tipped of by Johnno, Jay finds bags of cocaine. There is a mass shootout on a rocky bluff,though the hero,though vastly outnumbered, walks away with all his opponents dead. Pedersens stoic performance is incredible and Hugo Weaving exudes sinister,ambiguous affability. Could have done with subtitles.",1443484800,,1674,5.087272727272727

Good stuff starring actors I mostly haven't seen before (Mystery Road does include a turn from Hugo Weaving and some other faces I've seen before but not in awhile such as Jack Thompson). If you're not a fan of the genre I'd say it's skippable, but if you are a fan of the genre, well, I enjoyed it very much.",1423353600,,470,4.541176470588235

The acting is good, but, of course, everybody is extremely dour. Hardly a smile through the whole show. Moves slowly as the detective follows his clues, interviews witnesses and suspects, deals with pressure from his (white) bosses, and, after an exciting shoot-out, triumphs. So if you are looking for a good, entertaining crime film (and are willing to ignore some plot holes . . . whose TV is that, exactly?) I recommend this highly.

6479853,4,B00LD0V9UQ,"Mystery Road is a case study of ""Slow and Steady"" right up to the big scene.  But saying that as is does no favors for this very good film.  This movie is both a Who Dunnit and a Who is Selling What to Whom film set in the nowhere land of Queensland, Australia.  Aboriginal Det. Jay Swan catches a murder case which involves one of his own, a young teen girl known to his own (estranged) teen daughter.

All through the film Jay keeps plodding along despite obstacles from both white members of the community and police force as well.  Catching a break through forensics and another through good police work, Det. Swan manages start adding up the numbers and come to
the proper conclusion.

6479860,5,B00LD0V9UQ,"This thoughtful, slow moving, cop/murder investigation from Australia is a nice change for American audiences. The first good news is IT HAS CC/SUBTITLES tho that isn't listed on the product description but is SO helpful to us folks with hearing issues. Even with CC a lot of the terms used by the characters won't be familiar to us in the US but it doesn't effect being able to enjoy the film at all in my view. The film concerns a murder of a local aborigine girl investigated by a detective who is also black and likely grew up in the same town. The film touches on his dysfunctional family life as well as the corruption & racism that is present in this outback town that will remind many of the Central Valley of California (ie; Stockton, Bakersfield). The film has sparse dialogue, and leaves a few 'loose ends' in the story but no matter. It also has a terrific, modern day, 'shootout' scene reminiscent of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" which was very well done.

6479871,4,B00LD0V9UQ,"Jay Swann (Aaron Pedersen) returns from the big city to take up the job of detective in a small outback town where he has grown up. His first case is that of a young Aboriginal girl who is found murdered. His boss makes it clear that he will be `flying solo' as all his men are busy with other seemingly more important things.

He is of mixed race and seems to be both outside his native community and not wholly accepted by the all white police force. He starts to dig for clues and finds that for a small outback town there seems to be an awful lot going on, from drugs to prostitution and he is never quite sure where anyone stands - including his fellow officers. He also has to deal with the remnants of his relationship with an estranged teenage daughter.

This is a really good thriller and it kept me guessing right to the end, it did seem to have a few signposts as to who is Mr Guilty, but it is all cleverly done in a laid back yet calculated way. Pedersen as Swann puts in a rather good performance but there are some very entertaining support roles - especially the coroner who all add to the flavour. There is also a fair bit of barely veiled racism added to the mix. The locations are all perfect - so much so that you might miss out how much care has gone into some of the shots. This though is one of those films to see once because once you know the reveal then the real mystery is gone.

8665278,4,B00LD0V9UQ,"''Mystery Road'' is a western-like crime film, written and directed by the talented Ivan Sven. The movie is set in a small Australian town where everybody knows everybody and a gruesome killing of a black teenage girl takes place. The protagonist (Aaron Pedersen) is a young tough-but-fair police officer, divorced and the father of a young girl, who strives to solve the case having often to overcome the nonchalance of his colleagues and superior and the hostile behavior from witnesses and suspects. The plot moves slowly forward, enhancing the feeling of suspense and the breathtaking cinematography is bound to dazzle any viewer. ''Mystery Road'' is a very entertaining police procedural with top-level acting both by Pedersen and Hugo Weaving (in a supporting role) and a memorable, very well crafted, final shoot-out scene.

The newest is called Goldstone.  However the language is a thick Austrailian accent and  you really need subtitles to follow the plot.  In Mystery Road, the subtitles were out of synch and flashed so briefly, usually about 2 seconds that you could not read them.  We watched all the movie hoping something would improve but it didn't.
