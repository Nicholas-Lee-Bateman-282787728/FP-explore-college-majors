I urge you to bring VOLUME 2 to market---A.S.A.P.!!!!",1330905600,18,191,5.586206896551724
4530859,5,B0052STP0G,"A rare gem! Never shown in Germany and never released on DVD elsewhere.
Highly recommended for fans of Alfred Hitchcock presents and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour!
The picture quality is acceptable for a 1950's TV-Show.",1312416000,6,215,5.171428571428572

8454289,2,B0052STP0G,"Suspicion was a short-lived series, lasting only two obscure seasons. Though produced under the auspices of Hitchcock, it enjoyed as little involvement from the Master himself as did Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Like that earlier series (still ongoing at the time), his association was limited to approval or rejection of story options, while the bulk of production fell to others.

The sole exception was Four o Clock, a vengeance tale of a man who suspects his wife of adultery, and plans an explosive retribution, only to get hoisted (nearly) by his own petard.  Its superior quality is largely due to Hitchcock himself, who for once in this series took the directors chair.  Trouble is, Suspicion was mostly redundant, since the episodes were predominantly routine suspense tales of the kind already aired on AHP. Even Four oClock held to this formula, though it was more intense than the typical plot of its kind and stood well above its colleagues.

There was one additional gem, however, and that was an eerie tour de force called Voice in the Night, starring James Donald and Barbara Rush. Based on the brilliant short story of the same title by William Hope Hodgson, Voice was as creepy and atmospheric as the best work in the horror genre, ranking with F. Marion Crawfords The Upper Berth as possibly the greatest maritime horror tale ever written.

Voice, we might say, was something of an anomaly for Hitchcock at the time, even within the context of TV-sanctioned material. Appearing two years before Psycho and couched among boilerplate suspense productions, it almost inevitably got lost in the shuffle. Voice somehow managed to escape the attention of even horror aficionados; Stephen King, for instance, failed to consider it in his otherwise excellent non-fiction book, Danse Macabre.

I don't generally plug for DVD releases, and Im only belaboring Voice in the Night because it is NOT included in this set of three. Thats because Voice appeared in the second season, and the items included here are from season one only.

So what can we say about this series? We might say Suspicion was characterized by two front teeth, more gleaming than gleamed upon and spaced rather widely apart. The rest were somewhat carious.

Lets hope, therefore, that season two will be forthcoming soon, and that care will be taken on the transfers. That missing front tooth needs disinterment.",1490054400,,2390,5.0329113924050635
8454290,3,B0052STP0G,I say it's ok because the print quality or transfer quality is not very good.  Kind of milky like you'd see from an old 16mm print running on a low power television station late at night.  I give them credit for getting these shows put out as they deserve to be seen.  The episode 4 o'clock is often sighted as one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful directing efforts--and that is saying something.  It probably isn't that good but it's awfully good--with a white knuckle ending.,1471824000,,476,4.630952380952381

8454294,4,B0052STP0G,"I have for many years looked forward to an official release of this Alfred Hitchcock mystery tv series. ""Four O'Clock"" stands out as the best in picture quality...and also happens to be one of my favorite episodes featuring E.G. Marshall. However, please do not be detered, because the other episodes are still very watchable, and are the best in quality I have seen compared to another set I purchased a few years ago. I do recommend this entire set of Suspicion TV shows.",1433289600,,473,4.710843373493976
