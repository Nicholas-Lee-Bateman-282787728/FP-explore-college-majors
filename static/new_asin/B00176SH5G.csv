Unfortunately, the transfer to DVD is HORRIBLE to say the least.  The picture quality looks like someone recorded their poorest VCR copy (the one you lent out to all your friends and when you finally get it back, the insides have been jammed back into its case!) onto DVD.  On top of this, the sound transfer is barely recognizable and you have to turn your volume almost all the way up to figure out the dialogue.  This movie would only be bought by the hardest of hardcore collectors.  It's a shame that a fun movie like this gets a bad rap due to such a terrible transfer.

8265052,3,B00176SH5G,"Day of the Panther is a moderately fun but clich western-style martial arts movie.  The hero is Jason Blade who has been trained by a secret order of martial artists, the Panthers,  and is a stand out recruit even among their already exceptional ranks.

When his partner, Linda, is killed by a drug lords gang Blade vows to get revenge.  He sets out to infiltrate and bring down the crime organization.  When he crosses paths with the local Australian police they threaten him with deportation if he continues, but of course it wouldnt be much of a movie if he listened.  Blade may get the opportunity for his revenge against the murderous Baxter in an illegal tournament. (I wonder if Mr. Han is coming?)

The acting is weak though not comically bad.  The fighting feels too obviously staged though the fighters definitely do have some good moves.  The weapons don't look real and the good guys almost never take a hit unless they are fighting a boss.  There isn't a whole lot of story, and whats here is typical.

Content:
The violence includes a lot of fighting, of course, but is not graphic. Theres also some sex, partial nudity, and strong language.

DVD:
I got it in a 50 pack of Drive-In Movie Classics. The video is fuzzy and smudgy.  The audio is distorted but otherwise OK.  A Mill Creek logo jumps in like a ninja to punch you in the eyeballs. There are no extras.

There are a couple of standard DVD editions out there. They don't look like anything special so don't expect much out of them.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
As a martial arts fan I got some measure of entertainment out of the movie.  It cant hold a candle to the average Jackie Chan movie, but its worth an hour and a half if you're wanting some on-screen action.  If you're looking for anything else in a movie though I don't recommend this one. Ill grant it 3* though it probably only deserves 2.5. If you can put up with the logo watermark go cheap with the multi-movie pack, but one of the stand-alone DVD editions will be a more pleasant viewing experience. Just don't spend much because you won't be getting much for your money.",1521676800,,2099,4.507936507936508
8265053,1,B00176SH5G,"It took me 2 days to watch this movie. I started watching it yesterday & got to where I just couldn't stand to watch it anymore. I planned on finishing it later but never got back around to it so I started watching it again today. When I have to stop a movie & watch it again after awhile I restart it from the beginning. With Day Of The Panther I couldn't do it to myself all over again so I skipped ahead to where I left off & finished it from there. Other than the fight scenes, Day Of The Panther was boring. If it wasn't for the fight scenes I would've given up on this movie when I 1st had to turn it off yesterday. The only thing that makes it worth watching are the fight scenes. I enjoyed each & every 1 of them but the best has to be the very 1st. When Blade's partner burst through the wall to fight off the group of masked henchman, it reminded of all those fighting video games I like to play. The fight at the warehouse was pretty good as well. At the end it says Jason Blade will return in Strike Of The Panther. After watching this movie, I don't care enough to watch it unless it's a part of another movie pack I buy or have. There was suppose to be a 3rd named Escape Of The Panther but never got made. I know I wouldn't have any interest in seeing it either. Day Of The Panther is only a movie I'd suggest watching if you like 80's fighting flicks or just happen to buy a movie pack & it's included",1497484800,,1417,3.975438596491228
8265054,1,B00176SH5G,"The scene opens with Linda (Linda Megier) and Jason Blade (Edward John Stazak) being initiated into the ancient and secret Order of the Panthers, a crime fighting martial arts thing. Blonde Linda does undercover surveillance in Hong Kong...then off to Australia. On of the two don't make it past 20 minutes (the one that has a stunt double which looks like a man in a blonde wig)  and Jason has to avenge her death.  We know who kill Linda...at least we think we do as we see a guy throw a knife in her general direction. Guns are rarely used...hey! It's a martial arts film. Jason works carrying suitcases filled with flour and blank paper for the guy who tossed the knife. Bad guys get to wear cool Halloween masks. No sense letting someone you are trying to kill, see your face.

It was pretty boring stuff. I watched it on a 50 film unit and it could have used restoration. Cliche, formula, and poorly acted.

8265058,3,B00176SH5G,"""Day of the Panther"" is a minor cult flick from Australia that provides a so-so alternative to American martial arts flicks of the time. Given the movie's troubled production story, this is a respectable low budget karate adventure, though it's not quite as likable as many others I've seen. Check it out for most of the fighting, some of its silliness, but nothing else.

The story: A martial arts master (Edward Stazak) targets a crime syndicate after his comrade is murdered.

Ed Stazak's just about dropped off the face of the earth following the immediate release of this one's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B00007JGGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel</a>, and that's a disappointment, since the guy had some talent. He starts off as somewhat of a silly prettyboy who throws awkward kicks, but at some point he does a 180 turn and grows into both the choreography and the character. He's Down Under's answer to Van Damme - before Van Damme was even an established name - and seeing how he's way more nimble and shoots much longer takes than his western equivalent ever did, I wish I could have seen him in more films with bigger budgets.

Speaking of budgets, this movie clearly gets the most out of a limited one. There are plenty of locations, with means left over for the random boat chase. However, the limitations are more visible (and audible) in the cheap film and audio presentation, which would have given the picture a B-movie aura even if it had a larger scale. Decent acting arrives in the form of John Stanton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tai-Pan/dp/B000NOK1HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tai Pan</a>) as the hero's teacher and Michael Carman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nim-s-Island/dp/B001APZMJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nim's Island</a>) as the crime lord, but in general, the dramatic content leaves a lot to be desired.

The ten fight scenes tend to be on the high side of average. Again, Stazak starts off awkwardly - he's fond of throwing spin kicks but can't get his legs up high - but slowly develops to the point that he's almost a different performer. The best fight of the feature is one in a warehouse wherein he takes on three weapon-wielding thugs; the scene's Hong Kong vibe was way ahead of its time for a non-HK flick in 1988. Additionally, an extended segment wherein Linda Megier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Master/dp/B00005UO78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Master</a>) is chased through an abandoned complex is fairly exciting and believable.

The movie's got a goofy streak to it, but not enough so for me to comment on; it's not as funny as it wants to be. I've heard some fans profess love for this one, but personally, I don't think it's on the same cult level as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>. Check it out if it interests you, but otherwise, you can easily find some better ones.",1426723200,,3158,5.797413793103448
