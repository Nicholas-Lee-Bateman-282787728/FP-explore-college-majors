8427170,4,B004EKS8SS,"First let me say that when I received this product it would not play on my MacBook.  I contacted the company through Amozon's email and received a quick reply.  They immediately sent out a replacement as well as a self-stamped envelope for returning the defective DVD.  Apparently they have had some problems with this DVD playing on laptop computers.  After contacting the company I did try the DVD in my PC and my DVD player and discovered that it played fine in both of those.  I appreciate the promptness of this company in responding to my complaint.
  The DVD itself was very helpful.  It was my first attempt at any form of Taxidermy and I found the DVD to be easy to follow for a beginner.  I watched the DVD twice and then followed along with the DVD as I did my duck.  The instructions for the most part were clear and easy to follow.  My project turned out pretty good for a first time effort.  I have since completed a second project which turned out much better than the first.  I would most definitely recommend this DVD for anyone interested in doing their own Duck mount.",1299024000,4,1087,4.456852791878172
