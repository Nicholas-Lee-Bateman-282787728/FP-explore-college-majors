8109932,1,B000EHQUOY,"Three problems with this DVD, starting with errors in history:
1)  William the Conqueror was called Edward the Confessor's ""cousin"" in the video.  William the Conqueror was really Duke William of Normandy, descended from Duke Robert, first cousin of Emma of Normandy (Edward's mother), descended from Duke Richard I of Normandy. This fact is extremely important in understanding the invasion of England in 1066, as Edward's brother by the same mother, Prince Alfred, was betrayed earlier by Earl Godwin, who had both of Prince Alfred's eyes put out and had Prince Alfred's accompanying Norman retinue killed.  The royal family of England was thus, HALF NORMAN already (before the invasion) at this point.  Although not discussed in traditional histories of the period, I believe this flashpoint and insult to the Normans led to the eventual invasion.  Duke Robert (William's father) was already of a mindset to invade England to support Edward's claim when Prince Alfred died.  This preceded William's interest in England.
2) The video states that Mont St. Michel is ""in Normandy"".  This error reflects a misunderstanding of the European division of property into estates.  The Catholic Church was a separate estate from the secular authorities and so, Mont St. Michel, while attached to BOTH Brittany and Normandy, BELONGS TO NEITHER province.  It also has the reputation of being unconquered territory and thus, not belonging to Normandy.
3) Maxa makes the typical critical sophomoric mistake that English history began in 1066.  This is patently false and is just another way to slight and ignore the 500 years of development and unification of England PRIOR TO the Norman usurpation, under England's native and organic Saxon rulers.",1442361600,,1736,5.28

8109936,5,B000EHQUOY,"Great ""arm chair"" travel video with lots of information on interesting sites to visit, where to stay, how to get there, best times to go, what to wear...in other words, everything that you would need to know.  The video was filmed in a very relaxed manner and allowed time to view each scene without flashing quickly from one location to the next.  The soothing voice and calm manner of the narrator helped to make this video a pleasant, vicarious vacation to France.",1377302400,2,467,4.682926829268292
