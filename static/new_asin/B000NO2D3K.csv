2775162,5,B000NO2D3K,"If you want to learn how to do those amazing bellyrolls and delicate flutters just like professional bellydancers than this is a must have dvd. Through careful explanations and demonstrations, The Princess de-mystifies the art of the belly roll.
Now don't get me wrong, you won't be rolling and fluttering like the pros immediately after using this dvd but you will have a solid understanding of how the muscles work to create those incredible moves, thereby making it easier to learn how to do them. This dvd also includes extensive segments on variations of camel undulations and figure 8's.
Princess Farhana she has a wonderful, conversational tone to her voice and she doesn't rush through her instructions. Using this dvd feels more like dancing with a friend in your living room rather than following along with someone on a tv screen. Which, for me, makes working with this dvd a very enjoyable experience rather than just another, repetitive practice session.
This is one of the very, very few dvds on the market that teaches the art of the bellyroll and, in my humble opinion, it is the BEST.
All Hail the Princess!!!",1196985600,19,1126,4.869791666666667

8180118,3,B000NO2D3K,"I like the instructor and her personality, and I would attend a class of hers because she seems like a regular cool chick. Farhana is not the most technical dancer, but when she performs I can't take my eyes off her. She's fun to watch and her costumes are exhuberant, dahling. (I saw one video where she was performing with a candalabra on her head... it was awesome.)
This DVD actually is not a workout so don't expect that. It's mostly just a warmup and some simple instruction. If you take anything away from her it will be how to bellyroll and bellyflutter. No one does it quite like her and I never understood how to do a flutter until I heard her explainaition. It was like an epiphany. She'll also teach you how to combine some travel steps with your bellyrolls so they'll look even cooler.
The DVD menu's and the sets are charmingly low budget. They made me laugh!
This isn't the best DVD ever, and some people will be disappointed. However, I had lots of fun with it.",1389484800,,977,4.403314917127072
8180119,5,B000NO2D3K,"Nice DVD for learning/practicing rolls & flutters, as well as, covers undulations & figure 8's too. But not like an athletic workout. The title is misleading, this set up like a bellydance class or a workshop.
She explains and then demonstrates each movement with lots of repetition (you practice each move over & over -like a drill). Which is great when you need to practice..And she really pays attention to posture, which is awesome for a beginner.
Oddly enough, I find people either  ""love"" or really ""dislike"" Princess Farhana's DVDs. It seems you either like her or you don't ---and it's each persons preference based on personal expectation.
I will say the production quality feels a little amateur. But it wasn't a problem for me, because the content and material being taught is very good- the camera work & sound is fine.
And even once you have learned everything..it works well as a practice tool. I still pull this one out to work with.
Good DVD as a learning tool for the Beginner already in bellydance classes to the advanced beginner level.

You should be able to find clips of this DVD on youtube to make sure you like before you buy:

8180120,5,B000NO2D3K,A REAL BELLY DANCE DVD ALL THE WAY!  Excellent instruction for intermediate students.  She is a belly dancer not a fitness instructor or an aerobics instructor just showing you how to get your heart rate up.  She breaks down the steps and moves slowly instructing mostly hip moves.  I will watch this again and again.  It is timeless and a little more challenging than all of the beginner belly dance DVD's out there.  THANK YOU PRINCESS for making this one!,1377648000,2,458,4.6625
8180121,4,B000NO2D3K,"This DVD is a little bit different from most of the bellydance DVD's I've seen or own. There's no music in the background which seems a little odd, but you can hear Princess Farhana easily. The focus of this DVD is really on the flutters and rolls but she covers other things, too. This is a true intermediate level workout, but she breaks it down so well and makes it seem so easy. This is honestly like a Bellydance lesson more than a workout, and I think that beginners might be able to follow it. I don't know if I think she's the best bellydancer I've ever seen, (although she is really great), but she might be the best bellydance instructor I've come across.  I'll definitely purchase more of her DVD's because of her style of teaching.",1351814400,4,743,4.423357664233577
8180122,2,B000NO2D3K,"This DVD had great reviews especially for doing belly rolls so I bought it hoping to be inspired.

Its the worst Bellydance DVD I have bought - Whilst Princess Farhana seems really lovely person and passionate about her dance and has a lovely manner - the quality of DVD is cheap, and the section on belly work very short and not that comprehensive at all.

The rest of the DVD is also not that meaty and really a bit cheesy altogether.

My preference in style for meaty learning would be Autumn Ward, Jenna, or Leila of Egypt.  These are way better if you want to learn",1293926400,,570,4.349056603773585
8180123,5,B000NO2D3K,"There is a lot of great information on this DVD for the advanced beginner or the intermediate bellydance student who would like to learn rolls & flutters, or add variations to their movement vocabulary for a slow taqsim.

For myself, I found it was worth getting just for the instruction on roll and flutters alone. Ms. Farhana's explanations and thorough break downs of the muscular movements, along with breathing techniques and exercises, have really helped me progress.

I also liked the Figure eights, undulations, bodywave, and camel that are also covered. The basics are reviewed and practiced, with variations and some arm movements added. There is plenty of repetition so you can practice the moves for muscle memory. And the visuals and break downs where easy to understand and follow.

Not really a workout per say, it's set up like you are taking a real class. And since she goes through the series of movements with repetition, I find it's easy to use at home for my dance practice.

Introduction- with tips on performing and information on interpreting a slow piece of music-(very rarely does anyone talk about these things.)

A good DVD to try if you are beginner ready to go to the next level or an intermediate that needs practice!",1266883200,7,1404,5.0606060606060606
8180124,3,B000NO2D3K,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this DVD. I have been dancing for 8 years, and am always looking for a dance ,"" workout"" to learn more, and exercise at the same time. The word,"" workout"" in the title is misleading. ( I expected it to be like Jehan's Ultimate Bellydance Workout, which is actually a bellydance workout). The format is more like a class than a workout. Also, I would recommend this to anyone who is moving from beginner to intermediate and wants to get a jump start on moves you will be learning. Other than the bellyroll these moves aren't challenging to the advanced dancer. I did not like how there is no music at all while you are doing the moves,and you can even hear cars driving by in the background noise.
  So that I'm not all sour grapes,I will say that Princess Farhana has a definate style, and is interesting to watch, her burlesque background comes out in her dancing. She definately has a lot of personality. Also, like the previous reviews, there are little to no DVD's teaching rolls and flutters as well as she does( except maybe Suzanna del Vecchio's). So if you want an inexpensive DVD teaching how to roll and flutter, then this could be for you, but if you have been intermediate for a while, or advanced, this will be stuff you should have already learned. Thanks anyway, Princess!",1218153600,8,1334,4.508264462809917
8180125,4,B000NO2D3K,"Princess Farhana's explainations are very clear and her conversational tone pleasant. She does wonderful belly rolls and if you practise, I guess you can some day do like her. I also recommend her veil DVD, in the same no-nonsense style and with refreshing dances.
My only problem with this DVD was that I found it too short. 60mn is not long enough for this level. She could have incorporated more exercises, that's why I gave it only 4 stars and not 5.",1217289600,,454,4.548780487804878
8180126,5,B000NO2D3K,"This is wonderful for moving on from basic movements, how to combine and how move from one to the other.  Am now practising belly rolls and flutters.  I have this on VHS but will be buying DVD copy!!  Well worth the money and more",1197072000,13,230,4.181818181818182
