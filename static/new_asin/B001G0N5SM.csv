3593007,5,B001G0N5SM,"Hands down, this show is laugh out funny!! I own both Seasons One and Two. Iam eagerly waiting for the Third Season to come out, whenever that might be. I don't watch too many tv shows on a regular basis, but this show I definitely make it a point to watch. In fact, where I live, it's on twice the same night, one hour apart, on different channels. Sometimes I watch it both times! The combination between Julia Louis Dreyfus, and Wanda Sykes is priceless!! They work perfectly together! In fact, the whole cast does. This show has consistently great writing. I would NOT hesitate to buy every season that comes out. I know I will love it!!",1225497600,13,641,4.440677966101695

3593063,5,B001G0N5SM,"I loved this show when it was on - didn't miss an episode - and couldn't believe it had been cancelled. Had to the series on DVD so that I could watch it over and over again. The whole ensemble was beyond perfect and hilarious. And, by the way, I've been a fan of Julia Louise Dreyfuss before she ever appeared on Seinfield.",1359158400,,324,4.158730158730159
3593064,5,B001G0N5SM,"Not much to say and that is the best review. This is funny and you can watch over and over. Julia's acting, facial expressions, you name it are dead on. The cast is just as good. If you were one of those who never watched it when it was on network and are not sure.. buy an episode on here and see. I got the whole series after 3 episodes.",1351296000,,339,3.857142857142857
3593065,5,B001G0N5SM,"I love Julia Luis and Wanda Sykes, old Christine and her life after divorce, parenting and the
relationship she has with her brother are classic. I had to own it for myself to watch whenever I want, and need a good laugh. I will be ordering the rest of the set...... For sure!!!!",1347148800,,279,4.283018867924528
3593066,5,B001G0N5SM,The first two seasons of Christine are very funny and you seem to care more about the characters.  All five seasons are very good but as in most shows they tend to go overboard and get zanier near the end of the series.  But overall this is a great show and first two seasons are my favorites.,1344556800,,293,4.12280701754386
3593067,4,B001G0N5SM,The movies were shipped fast but when I got them the plastic circle in the middle that holds the DVD in place was broke. But I do enjoy them.,1340323200,2,141,3.896551724137931
8303512,5,B001G0N5SM,"Everything Dreyfus touches is gold, and this is no exception. The setup is perfect and the ensemble cast is spot on. Unlike many series this one had it together from the get go, so there was no break in period during season one. Honest and silly at the same time this is classic tuff.",1522454400,2,284,4.277777777777778

8303518,5,B001G0N5SM,"Very few shows make me laugh out loud, but this one does. It's hilarious!!!  There are so few shows on TV anymore that are good so I am purchasing dvd's of my favorites. This one is a must buy for me.",1465430400,,200,3.8780487804878048

8303521,5,B001G0N5SM,"Love this series.  At first, I didn't think a series about a goofy, ""easy"" woman would be my cup of tea.  It quickly grew on me and I found myself laughing at every member of this great cast. They work so well together and I'm only sorry the series isn't longer.  Not really for young children, but I believe adults will look forward to each episode. I think Julia Louis-Dreyfus is the best woman comedian on TV today.",1461110400,,418,4.333333333333333
