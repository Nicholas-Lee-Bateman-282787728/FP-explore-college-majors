8472173,5,B005GQNQH2,"Every flaw I had with the original dragon ball z has been fixed in this modern remake of dragon ball z,dragon ball z kai! A lot less filler ruining action and story-CHECK! Quality Funimation Dub-CHECK! Rerecorded Japanese Dub-CHECK! music score that sounds classical,but has an epic twist-CHECK! Catchy New Theme song-CHECK!!! Original Fullscreen Format-CHECK!!!.Also the fights are still brutal and epic,the only things edited are a few nudity scenes and raditz vs piccolo scene,but unlike nicktoons and 4kids version,dialogue and video kept true to japanese version. If you are looking for the definite version of dragon ball z, buy these!!! Also,there is a majin buu saga coming to kai,so don't feel like you will be missing out on an entire part of story,They are still making it,in march 2014!!!",1393545600,,800,5.209302325581396
8472174,5,B005GQNQH2,Ok just to let everyone know this is the W*M double pack with both parts 1 and 2 in a single cardboard sleeve i was worried that it would be something else when a seller had it on here for just $7 new when it's $30 new at W*M. i'll probably be posting a video review sometime and will be posting pictures soon.,1322524800,4,310,3.9365079365079363
