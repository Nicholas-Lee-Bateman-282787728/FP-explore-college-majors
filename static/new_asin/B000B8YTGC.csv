8331905,2,B000B8YTGC,"Don't bother getting this video. It only shows you how to blow on a call. If you're a little kid this might be helpful. There is no information about setup location, wind direction, approaching your setup location, the general behavior of predators, when the best times are to call or the mating seasons. It's not even worth the 3 bucks I paid for it. It is just a big advertisement for Mr. Sceery to sell his hand held predator calls. I'm a professional predator hunter and this video is worthless.",1318982400,,499,4.555555555555555
