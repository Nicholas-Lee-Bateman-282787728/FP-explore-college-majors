8285560,3,B001C0I61W,"I wanted the 1997 British television version of the film, ""The Canterville Ghost,"" starring Rolf Saxon, Ian Richardson and Celia Imrie in the film. I bought this triple DVD for a bargain price compared to the individual piece. The other two films, ""Children of the New Forest"" and ""Coral Island"" are just fine to watch but not terribly exciting.

The first film, ""The Children of the New Forest,"" was a bit of a down episode with Malcolm Storry as Uncle Jacob Armitage. He inherits his two nieces and nephews during the harsh times of Sherwood Forest. The film depicts the struggles of their lives in the forest in the 1600s.

The second film, ""The Canterville Ghost,"" is perhaps the best of the three films. The cast is first rate as Ian Richardson played Simon De Canterville beautifully. Rolf Saxon played the rich American who bought the Canterville estate. Celia Imrie did a fantastic job as his wife and mother. There is a love story too. Edna Dore played the housekeeper. Pauline Quirke played the psychic.

The third and final film, ""Coral Island,"" doesn't hold the same interest. It biased on the classic adventure novel set in the 1850s. After their ship sinks, they survive on Coral Island. The acting is fine especially the young cast members.

The three films were classified as the three historical period classic films for the British TV Family Collection. The films were aired on British television first. There are no special features or extras on this DVD.",1516492800,,1474,4.837301587301587

8285563,5,B001C0I61W,These were great fun to watch and in a few years I hope to watch them with my grandchildren.  I even looked around for other versions of them and found a few of The Canterville Ghost which were different but fun to watch as well.  I always assume that the movie will be different from the original story and enjoy seeing how many different stories can be made from the same root.,1239235200,6,379,4.25
