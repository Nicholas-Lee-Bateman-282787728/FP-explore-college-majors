It has some memorable characters (Camille, Shandi) and has genuine heartfelt drama like the episode of about the girl who cheated. What's annoying are some of the photo shoots.

As a feminist I know what's wrong with it (pitting women against each other, glorifying more or less a certain body type) as well as it being a ""reality"" store, so you knowwhoever makes it is manipulating it to make you perceive things a certain way. But I guess as long as you can recognize that it's entertaining",1422576000,,347,4.4375

It has some memorable characters (Camille, Shandi) and has genuine heartfelt drama like the episode of about the girl who cheated. What's annoying are some of the photo shoots. They are ridiculous i.e. the water tank shoot and in future cycles they get more silly.",1415836800,,413,4.447368421052632

8255348,5,B0014E6424,"This season if America's Next Top Model is still one of the juiciest in my mind and brought some of the coldest, aggressive ladies to the scene. You've got Camille McDonald, who has more self confidence with her signature walk and who is open about the fact she wants to bring down her enemy Yoanna House with a fake friendship. Yoanna is no angek though; when her buddy Shandi Sullivan has too much to drink, she lets her sleep with an Italian stranger and cheat on her boyfriend. Awful but hey now Yoanna is going to be feeling great tomorrow and Shandi is an emotional wreck. April Wilkner gets help from a girl the first episode and then stabs her in the back episose two. Catie Anderson perfected the art of crying at the drop of a hat. Bethany Harrison tells Tyra that the judges need to get over her chest. I mean there is so much crazy, juicy girl drama that this will always be one of my guilty pleasure throwback reality TV shows. This was also before Tyra Banks got too big for her britches and -shocker alert - actually hangs out with the models like a peer not some Wizard of Oz behind a curtain who only appears to make up words like smize and booty tooch. This is real, old school Tyra and I love it.",1481414400,2,1215,4.28695652173913
