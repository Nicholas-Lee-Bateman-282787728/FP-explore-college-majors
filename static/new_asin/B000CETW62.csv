8098191,3,B000CETW62,"I'm an amateur photographer and was just trying to find some resources that would help me learn what the camera can do.  There was nothing useful to me in the first sections of this DVD.  The last section about settings had some great info but they went through it so fast. Had to keep pausing and going back.  It was OK, but nothing great.  I had learned most of this doing research on the internet.",1359763200,,400,4.293333333333333

8098193,5,B000CETW62,I really liked this DVD. It's easy to follow and understand. It can be watched in sections or as a movie. This is very good for beginners so they can take charge of their Canon Rebel XT camera and make the best use of it instead of just owning a very expensive point and shoot camera. I highly recommend this DVD. It's a good learning tool.,1304985600,2,340,4.166666666666667
8098194,5,B000CETW62,Canon should hire this group to give help to new owners of DSLRs. Quit wasting the paper to make a manual and just give the video in the box. I alread know more from this video in 30 mins than I did from the manual. I can't wait to get out with my camera tomorrow!
