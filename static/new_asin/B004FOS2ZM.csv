8428130,4,B004FOS2ZM,"this is a good product. the decks are just right for my daughter. the dvd is not quite a half hour. but it is ok. no bad language. so no worries there. it kept my 6 and 5 year old occupied for the length of the dvd. all in all it is good, and you can't beat the price!",1295827200,2,268,3.559322033898305
