7800480,5,1620336235,"I own over dozen tutorial dvds, books and other instructional material on stone setting.  I recently came across Ann Cahoon's dvds while searching for more instructional dvds because I always felt I was missing something because most dvds leave out many important tips and don't quite explain or show properly.  After going through this dvd, I must say it is one of the best and most thorough instructional dvds out there for stone setting.  Ann gives tips and instructions like its a surgical procedure, leaving out nothing and offering plenty of tips for new and skilled alike.  Highly recommended!  I wish Ann will produce more instructional dvds on channel, pave setting etc.

Also, the quality and sound of the video is top notch.",1432512000,9,735,4.934959349593496
