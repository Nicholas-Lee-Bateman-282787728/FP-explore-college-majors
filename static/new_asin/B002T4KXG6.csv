You won't see the typical 'cooking meals'.... lifting some weights.... driving around town.... shaky camera..... or apathetic disposition from other DVDs of dieting bodybuilders. What you get is pure entertainment and authenticity. Even if you're not a bodybuilder, fitness enthusiast, or have even lifted a weight in your life... I guarantee you'll still get something out of this DVD!",1332720000,2,531,5.409638554216867

Be the best you can be! And I'm 52...lol!",1332115200,,404,4.583333333333333
