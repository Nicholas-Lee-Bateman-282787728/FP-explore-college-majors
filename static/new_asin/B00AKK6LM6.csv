5447936,4,B00AKK6LM6,I remember watching this as a kid.  It was interesting to watch it again.  It is not as good as Lynda Carter's portrayal but is fun.,1358812800,,132,4.038461538461538

5447938,5,B00AKK6LM6,"I remember watching this as a little kid growing up in the 70s. No, it is not as good as the Lynda Carter series and Cathy Lee does not look like the Wonder Woman we have grown up with, but it is still a good action movie and a different take on the Amazing Amazon.
This should probably have been what David Kelley should have watched to try and help his modern day adaptation. The story line is good and Cathy Lee does a respectable job playing Diana and Wonder Woman. What a neat twist that Steve Trevor knows her secret and lets her go on missions to help out and then comes back to be his secretary (70s word:) ). When her hair is down the everyone seems to know she is Wonder Woman.
She may not have the super strong strength but she has the enhanced abilities of us mere mortals and is able to jump from speeding cars and grab thrown javalins at her while riding a donkey. :)
It would have been interesting to see how this would have played out if it had become a series but then we would not have had our beloved Lynda Carter in her red, white and blue bathing suit.
To recap, a nice different adaptation, a good plotline, and a respectable job from That's Incredible Cathy Lee! Enjoy it!",1357603200,4,1195,4.2
5447939,1,B00AKK6LM6,"This movie always irked me.  This movie version of the Wonder Woman character was nothing like what was found in the comics.  Crosby is blond and wears a motor cycle racer type full covering outfit.

The story was boring.  It was just a hard to follow film.

I feel all involved in this project--including DC comics for giving the green light on this oddity-- must have been hippie high to unleash such a motion picture mess of a film.  By all means SKIP this film!  To this day, the only gal that filled the Wonder Woman boots and brought her to life & greatness was Lynda Carter in the 70's live action show.  The other two great versions of Wonder Woman on film was on the SuperFriends and the Justice League animated series.

Even back then DC comics didn't know what they were doing in regards to crossing over their comics to film.....Superman Returns was horrid, the Dark Knight films were soooo drawn out and overrated and Man of Steel looks like it will be as bad as this Crosby version of Wonder Woman...

DC just needs to stick to making animated movies with Bruce Timm--They are the only ones that stay true to the characters.",1357344000,5,1138,4.480582524271845
5447940,3,B00AKK6LM6,"WONDER WOMAN (1974) starring Cathy Lee Crosby comes to DVD at long last via the amazing (and essential) Warner Bros. Archive!  This is a tough movie to pin down - the absolutely *beautiful* Cathy Lee Crosby is excellent as Wonder Woman, but the turgid script by John D.F. Black (STAR TREK - Season One writer/story editor) is difficult to sit thru - this movie is a scant 73 minutes...that runs for AT LEAST 3 hours :-).  Wonder Woman's costume is a Hollywood fabrication and looks nothing like the Classic costume from the comic books (TV network logic unleashed...).  The Diana-as-a-secret agent set-up was later utilized - far more effectively - as the premise for the last two seasons of the Lynda Carter WONDER WOMAN TV series.  Trivia Note - Kaz Garras who plays Steve Trevor later guest-starred on the 1979 WONDER WOMAN episode ""Going, Going, Gone"".  Guest stars Andrew Prine and Ricardo Montalban are A-plus all the way.  There are also several excellent action/battle scenes in this movie (particularly Wonder Woman's duel with Ahnjayla, the renegade Amazon).  The picture and sound quality is good overall - there is definite ""grain"" visible in several scenes, but nothing too distracting.  If you own the Lynda Carter WONDER WOMAN TV series on DVD (a ""must-own"" TV series!), this TV movie makes for interesting - but perhaps not ""essential"" - viewing.  I give this movie 3 (Wonder) Stars!!!",1355961600,41,1401,4.952991452991453

5447970,5,B00AKK6LM6,"I've never heard anyone say anything good about this TV pilot film, just as I've rarely heard anyone say anything good about the period in the late 60s in which the WW comic was retitled, ""Diana Prince, Wonder Woman"" and the character relinquished her costume, code-name, super-powers and JLA membership in favor of an Emma Peel-style look and adventures.  No less a personage than Gloria Steinhem actively lobbied to have the character restored to her traditional interpretation and so she was long since by the time of this pilot, which nevertheless was clearly modeled on that period.  Standing on its own, however, the movie, like the Diana Prince comic, is fairly compelling and does no disservice to Wonder Woman.  It re-imagines her as a mere mortal, a female super-spy with a mystical origin, who despite her lack of super-powers, proves capable of extraordinary feats.  In short, she is the very model of the woman that Wonder Woman was designed to inspire young girls to become; smart, strong, beautiful and confident.  Sans her magic girdle and boomerang tiara, she is still the Amazonian ideal, the wonder that Amazon philosophy says all women are.  Cathy Lee Crosby is quite winning in the role, despite being as far removed from the traditional picture of the comic character as Robert Redford would have been had he been cast in the 1978 Superman film (which he nearly was--and with all due to reverence to Christopher Reeve, does anyone think Redford would have made a bad Man of Steel?), especially in the resolute optimism she displays (perhaps the character's most defining attribute) as she doggedly pursues villain Ricardo Montalban and confronts a rogue Amazon, the latter a brilliant idea that was never explored in the comic.  Fans don't like the film because it's a radical departure from the classic version of an iconic character, but it's a worthwhile interpretation that is remarkably true to the spirit of the original.",1432598400,8,1949,5.015479876160991

5447975,3,B00AKK6LM6,"I can't help thinking that the producers sat down with the script-said it's too long-take out pages 24-25 and 40-45 and 50-56. That would explain some of the inconsistencies that abound. Some of the plot just makes little or no sense. That said Cathy Lee Crosby makes a fair heroine, given a sexless costume and some poor direction. Her duel with fellow Amazon Anitra Ford is a huge waste of screen time, so badly is it choreographed and filmed. Only Cathy and Montalban (and, I suppose Andrew Prine) make this worth giving it a go, but frankly...no wonder (no pun intended) it had to have a serious reboot. What would have happened if Cathy had Lynda's sexy costume, budget, scripts and co-stars? Would she have been such a big hit? We'll never kknow.

While the story itself may not have been bad, the leap of faith to make Diana a blonde was an abysmal decision. Fans want an accurate representation of our favorite heroine. So, I suspect that was the reason it tanked and rightly so. I would have accepted the jumpsuit because it was as the comics were in that day. But, please!

Audio and Video are just great, looks like the work on restoring and preserving the tapes with this movie pilot were really fabulous, but the DVD could be better with some extras. The menu gives you only the 'Play Movie' option, but well...that's probably all that remained from this pilot.

The movie itself is really a 70's themed thing, Wonder Woman is somekind of super spy and we have tons of investigation scenes, so unfortunately a lack of action during more than 1h of movie.

Nevertheless, this incarnation of the DC heroine is solidly diverting entertainment. Smack dab in the middle of the disco decade, this movie bears all the marks of a delightfully dated era, replete with freeze frames, acid trip commercial break bumpers, syntho-funk score, and more polyester than you can shake a stick at. The pacing and plotting is at a clip, so there's no real time to mock the dated production values. And though Cathy Lee Crosby can never claim to be the ""real"" Wonder Woman, her combination of doe-eyed beauty and proto-feminist moxie is well able to sustain the film's 90-minute running time (presaging Charlie's Angels in many ways).",1367798400,3,874,5.0344827586206895
5448014,4,B00AKK6LM6,"Captain America came to mind the first time I saw this different Wonder Woman suit offered as a custom choice in a old catalog, then this movie was on one late night. As a kid who grew up watching SuperFriends and seeing Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, I hated that she was blonde and wore a ""fake"" outfit in this movie. But after all these years, I've mellowed a bit having to deal with blonde Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) in both comics and on Young Justice (a show I love), where the character grew on me. Initially, I wondered who would want this low rent, non Lynda Carter version until I revisted it on Youtube. Then I had to have the dvd. The movie moves along quite well with its cool 70's style, thanks in large part to Artie Baker's tight retro beats which pepper the action moments. And with Kate's face, Farrah's hair and Jaclyn's wardrobe, Cathie Lee Crosby is awesome as a one woman Charlie's Angels outsmarting her opponents and saving the day. The tall, skinny actor playing ""George"" looks like a real life character from Battle of the Planets and would make a great Zoltar (or another bad guy). Spoiler Alert: my favorite moments include the phone booth, pool party, colored lava trap, and javelin throwing scenes. Maybe we'll always picture Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, but with all of DC's crazy alternate universes, there's room for one more, in Cathy Lee Crosby.

5448017,5,B00AKK6LM6,"I first watched this weird little incarnation of ""Wonder Woman"" on TBS when I was nine years old, and even then I appreciated that it tried to be different. Cathy Lee Crosby was wonderful as Princess Diana/Wonder Woman, even though she is obviously blonde and wears a much different outfit than the ""classic"" Wonder Woman. Here, Diana is more of an  undercover action spy who works as a secretary for Steve Trevor, even though he seems to know what she's really up to. Diana mostly jumps around and doesn't have super powers, yet gets the job done. Ricardo Montalban plays the villain and is mostly hidden for a big part of the film, but you hear his unmistakable voice giving out orders. Anitra Ford plays a rogue fellow Amazon named Ahnjayla, and I couldn't help but wonder why SHE wasn't chosen to play Wonder Woman. The movie was originally meant to be a pilot for a series that was never picked up, and it is an undeniably fun little gem.

5448037,3,B00AKK6LM6,"Lynda Carter cast such a magical spell upon the character of Wonder Woman during her 60-episode tenure as the Amazon Princess, it may come as a surprise to many that she wasn't the first actress to play the role.  That honor went to tennis player-turned-actress Cathy Lee Crosby, who was cast as Wonder Woman in a pilot film made for ABC nearly two years prior to Carter's version.  The pilot's writer, John D.F. Black, based this version of the character on a storyline in the Wonder Woman comic, where she lost all her powers and traveled the world as an independent adventurer who fought crime with little more than her courage and martial arts skills.  Although this storyline had long since concluded by the time Black finished his script, it clearly had a substantial influence on him.

The pilot centers on Wonder Woman's efforts to retrieve a set of code-books which contain the names and cover identities of virtually every undercover agent working for the United States.  A criminal mastermind named Abner Smith (charmingly played by the always-entertaining Ricardo Montalban) offers to sell the books back for a king's ransom; having little reason to think he can be trusted, Wonder Woman sets out to find him before the deadline is reached.  The pilot establishes her as working for a secret government agency, ostensibly as a secretary to Steve Trevor (Kas Garas) but in fact an accomplished agent in her own right.  It's never fully established whether she truly maintains a secret identity; one of Smith's agents referrs to her as ""Wonder Woman"" while she's in civilian attire, suggesting that ""Wonder Woman"" is nothing more than a code-name, much as ""007"" refers to James Bond.

Indeed, this version of Wonder Woman is far more suitable to low-key espionage stories than super-heroics.  Most of the iconic devices used in the comic book (and the follow-up series with Lynda Carter) are either used out of context or are completely absent.  There is no Magic Lasso or Tiara, her Bracelets are not magical (though they do conceal minature explosives), and her Invisible Jet is thrown in almost as an afterthought.  While she's an accomplished fighter, there's only one instance where she displays anything resembling super-strength, and in all instancs she seems no more than an highly-trained, highly capable woman who is not so extraordinary as to be considered super.  Her origins are encapsulated in a short sequence where Diana bids farewell to her sisters on (an unnamed) Paradise Island and receives the blessings of her mother; it's simply stated that she's been chosen to bring her people's ways to the outside world, though we never learn why she was chosen or why she wanted to go in the first place.

The positives?  There certainly are a few.  Although she's miscast in the role, Cathy Lee Crosby is actually fairly good, giving Wonder Woman as much dignity as the script allows her to.  Kas Garas is nearly a dead ringer for Steve Trevor as he appeared in the comic books at the time, but unfortunately he isn't given much to do.  (Garas went on to make a guest star appearance in the Lynda Carter series [the Season Three episode ""Going, Going, Gone"".)  There's virtually no action in the story, save for a battle between Wonder Woman and a rogue Amazon, Angela (Anitra Ford, who looks more like the comic-book Amazon Princess than Crosby did); Ford plays the part with relish, and had the pilot gone to series she would have made an excellent recurring villain.

All in all, this attempt at Wonder Woman isn't up to power, and though this pilot floated in syndication as a stand-alone telefilm for a number of years, it was Lynda Carter who (rightfully) captured our imaginations by her dead-on performance as the Amazon Princess.  Still, now that the Cathy Lee Crosby version is finally (and legally!) available on DVD, fans of Wonder Woman may find it worth a look, if only to speculate how this incarnation would have worked out had ABC accepted it as an ongoing series.  Would Cathy Lee Crosby have been as solid an anchor as Lynda Carter?  Would the show have ironed out the problems in the pilot and found its own voice?  Would thousands of teenage boys in 1974 be hanging posters of Crosby on their bedroom walls, sporting her very different version of the Wonder Woman costume?

Have a look, and judge for yourself.",1359072000,12,4353,4.843454790823212
5448038,5,B00AKK6LM6,"I remembered watching this movie when I was kid and had always liked it.  When I saw that it was available for the first time I was a little hesitant to buy as I thought it might appear to be dated.  After all, it was made back in 1974 prior to Lynda Carter taking on the roll.
I watched it with my 14 year old daughter and much to my surprise we both loved it.  Cathy Lee Crosby is excellent as Wonder Woman.  She is an actress with great style and beauty.  The story had a decent plot and I loved the 70s background music as well as the theme song.  It is a shame they didn't make a series with Cathy as Wonder Woman but this movie stands well on its own.  My daughter also liked the fact that her outfit in this movie was a little more conservative than Lynda Carter's.

5448039,1,B00AKK6LM6,"This manages to make the West/Ward Batman series look watchable by comparison. Shaft's co-writer made Wonder Woman into a blond wearing a cheesy jumper. It's theorized he also was influenced by Mike Sekowsky's direction of Wonder Woman comics.  Character names are the only thing which appears recognizable.

Whoever was in charge of casting honestly did not understand that even in Sekowsky's 'mod era' Wonder Woman still had her dark hair. This is is a complete mess!

Opening music sounds like a dental drill, and not at all exciting for a good movie. Or even good plot. The audience is forewarned that this movie is going to be a very painfull and ultimately unpleasant experience. We've not even supposed to stick around.

And what on earth is the purpose of placing her in a trap with rainbow-colored mud? She plays some kind of secret agent, rather than a superhero who goes under cover as a mortal or even a Wonder Woman who has lost her powers. It's not clear what angle the script writers were really attempting to create. Even the I Ching Comic books had Wonder Woman with black hair. They understood that she was not a blond!!

Kas Garas looks bored instead of in need of rescue/assistance as Government Agent Steve Trevor. He's only in this movie because he was paid off and he thinks that this script...etc is stupid. Apparently pitying his involvement with this project, people later in charge of the 'good Wonder Woman' did give him a guest role as 'Lucas' during an episode. His talent really shines through with halfway decent scripting efforts.

I am assuming that then-tennis star Crosby only obtained her title role because the studio wanted an 'athlete' to play the Amazing Amazon. Crosby hand  actually 'bested' Lynda Carter--who obviously was built for the part. It was a really stupid move by the studio.

Crosby would have been better as one of the 'background' amazons who also lives on  Paradise Island. Or 'a woman in America'.  And I'm sure a few people in Hollywood lost their jobs when this TV movie failed to rake in the anticipated 'super' big bucks just for having the 'Wonder Woman' name slapped onto 'anything'.

Realizing they were being fed 'imitation', people were not impressed. They wanted a good series.

Fortunately, since this was the era when there were only 3 networks--and no cable, the idea of Wonder Woman as a TV series was not immediately pulled from television production.

It went onto a 'second life' after all Carter got to work with the 'new' and severely retooled high dollar project, while Crosby's name is forever attached to this train wreck of a script. There is a reason why we don't see here as an 'A lister' any more. Of course Crosby  wants to pretend she was moving on up and away to the much more remembered ABC series. The movie is garbage.

It would have tanked a network in a much more competitive era.",1358812800,3,2873,4.740963855421687

She really looks like a Greek goddess.  Perhaps the only woman more beautiful on television at the time was Lynda Carter who became Wonder Woman in the later TV series which is completely dissimilar from this version.  I'm pretty sure this movie pre-dates ""Fantasy Island"" but Ricardo Montalban plays the bad guy and he's the same white suited character here.  A no frills DVD preserving an artifact from the past.  Too bad this was not developed.  The format might have worked better than the show that was eventually made.  Here, Wonder Woman is more of a super spy and her super powers are underplayed and she relies on her brain and innate kindness and humor.  Written by John D.F. Black of Star Trek fame.

Her bracelets ARE her sheid) while her outfit was darkened and modeled after Xena Warrior Princess. SMH.
