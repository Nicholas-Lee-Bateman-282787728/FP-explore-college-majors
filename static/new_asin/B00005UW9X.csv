1669034,5,B00005UW9X,"Best lookin 'wee lil one' leprechaun I've observed in a movie that I have seen in the past 50yrs aside from Disney's ""Darby McGill and the Little People"" film! Sends a message about how human's have taken over all of Mother Earth's beautiful natural living environments destroying all in the name of so called ""progress""!",1406246400,2,321,4.8545454545454545
1669035,1,B00005UW9X,"Unfortunately, there is not much I can say about this movie.  I watched the first 15 minutes of it and was not entertained.",1395100800,2,123,4.3478260869565215
1669036,3,B00005UW9X,"This fantasy-themed fantasy story centers around siblings Ethel and Tommy who study at a boarding school and are sent away to Ireland during the summer to live with their father's new fiancee (played by Veronica Hamel). Eventually the siblings discover that their father's new fiancee is actually a malevolent spirit who is aided in her nefarious pursuits by a creepy butler (played by David Warner who is always a treat to watch in a villain role). Luckily for the kids, they have the help of a leprechaun who might just turn their luck around! The movie is Not Rated, and runs 93 minutes. I think the movie might be a tad creepy and scary for younger children, so perhaps the appropriate age group for this film would be 6 and up.",1370044800,2,732,4.595419847328245
1669037,2,B00005UW9X,"Two stars for effort.  Its a ""B"" movie that takes an okay plot, but never gives it life.  In the end, even the plot fell through as the ""environmental"" message took over.  My 10 year old told me I have to redeem myself with the next movie I pick...  Tough to hear from a 10 year old.",1367712000,3,283,3.912280701754386
1669038,5,B00005UW9X,A Leprechaun versus an evil witch trying to marry a very nice man who owns lots of land.  Good family story!,1235692800,6,108,4.142857142857143

1669067,2,B00005UW9X,"Overriding theme is environmentalism.  Had some funny parts.  Lame plot, if you can call it that.
Kids couldn't act.  Leprechaun was not in it enough to make sense and even when he was it still didn't make sense.  What the hell was he there for?  Evil is destroyed, and after watching the movie I still don't know how it was destroyed.  Kinda like a Disney movie with kids that tries to ""cute"" it's way past a weak storyline.",1463184000,,425,4.384615384615385
1669068,4,B00005UW9X,Funny I liked it,1463097600,,16,3.25
1669079,3,B00005UW9X,"Not a bad movie, just a little slow developing of the story, kind of like making a 5 book series of a story that can be told in 1 book. Not for the very young I would say, it's not totally Disney and the value of it would fly right over their head. With some guidance I would say, 7years and up. I had some time to kill and this did the trick.",1463097600,,343,3.712328767123288

1669081,5,B00005UW9X,"Once again, a fun movie with a few twists, some laughs and leprechaun treasure.  Not for the seriously serious viewer but if you just need a fun distraction, you should try this little film.",1462320000,,190,4.588235294117647

1669084,5,B00005UW9X,My 8 and 9 year old grandsons were glued to the screen.  The magic and countryside sense were wonderful. A movie with a positive motto.,1461542400,,135,4.4

1669086,3,B00005UW9X,"Semi-entertaining for my 12, 10 and 8 yr olds. I thought the Banshee was WAY too scary for anyone younger than that. Kids being mean to elders, elders bordering on to being abusive to the children-not my cup of tea.  Poor, stilted acting. The end is nice and tied up and all ends well, but kinda sorry I wasted my time.",1461024000,,319,4.229508196721311

1669160,5,B00005UW9X,The only thing wrong with this finely crafted bit of dark children's fantasy is that I wasn't able to watch it when I was a kid. Forget about outer space and da Hood and watch this one with your kids.,1410048000,,200,4.025

7955697,1,B00005UW9X,"Darby O'Gill it is not.  this is a really, really badly executed kids' film.  predictable is ok for a kids' film, simplistic dialog also, but at this level the target audience must be at most 4 years old.",1487635200,,204,4.342105263157895
7955698,3,B00005UW9X,"A classic theme for the time period, most likely an attempt to compete, & mimic the successes of whimsical themed 'Disney' movies of the era .  Well acted, with a couple of noteworthy special effects tossed into the mix.",1487203200,,220,4.641025641025641
