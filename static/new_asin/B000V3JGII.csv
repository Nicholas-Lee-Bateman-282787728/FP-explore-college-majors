2928640,5,B000V3JGII,"Coen Brothers Best Movies All In One Set.

What More Could You Ask For.",1199232000,2,71,4.071428571428571
2928641,5,B000V3JGII,"I'm not sure if a better 5 film collection exists right now. While this collection is missing one big thing, ""The Big Lebowski"", it is nevertheless the essential Coen brothers set to own. Whether you have been a fan since ""Blood Simple"" or you have just been introduced to the Coen's magic with their amazing new film ""No Country for Old Men"", then this set will appeal to you. Containing 5 films, ""Blood Simple"", ""Raising Arizona"", ""Miller's Crossing"", ""Barton Fink"", and ""Fargo"" this set covers all the bases of the Coen brothers brand of film making. From the ridiculously hilarious (Raising Arizona), to the dark and dramatic (Miller's Crossing and Blood Simple), and finally to a hybrid of the two (Fargo and Barton Fink), these films show the Coen brothers at their best.

One thing you will notice throughout these films is that the brothers use the same stable of actors in several of their movies. I have heard some people complain about this, but I think it is fantastic. The reason they do this is because they know how to get the exact performance that they want from each of these great actors (John Goodman being a prime example). And the characters throughout their films are so quirky and distinct, that you will never have to worry about seeing the same performance twice.

If you don't own any Coen films then nothing should be stopping you from picking up this set, but even for fans who may own a film or two, or three, it is a great way to have 5 of the brothers best films in one place. Pick up ""The Big Lebowski"" and, if you like, ""O Brother Where Art  Thou"", and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and you will have every Coen film worth owning.

And whether you enjoy any or all of these films, go see ""No Country for Old Men"", it is an extremely good film, one of the best of this decade. The Coen's are back, and I'm sure they have exciting things planned for the future.",1197849600,23,1890,4.469565217391304
2928645,5,B000V3JGII,This includes a few less recognizable titles and they are wonderful! The old stand-bys are awesome too. Look forward to nights of enjoyment!,1357776000,,140,5.130434782608695
2928646,5,B000V3JGII,The Coen Brothers movies are to be watched over and over again. Each time you view one of their movies you find something you missed before,1355356800,,139,4.384615384615385
2928647,2,B000V3JGII,"I appear to be the only person on Earth who does not get why the Coen brothers are so liked by everybody out there.  I can see how good their films are made, bu I can honestly say that almost all their movies are unenjoyable garbage with a few exceptions.  Two of the movies in this collection are their best.  The first, Blood Simple is a great film noir in the truest tradition.  It is suspenseful and sleazy.  You feel like you need a shower after watching such unpleasant characters, but the film is all the better because of it.  The only other great film of theirs until 2010s True Grit was Raising Arizona, a truly quirky story, and very funny.  As for he rest, they are great achievements in film construction, but all singularily unpleasant in their own way.  I know I am in the minority opinion on this and this will cause great acrimony among their fans, but I can't help it.  None of heir films other than the ones I just listed really deserve more than 2 stars, but they are virtual textbooks on the nuances of filmmaking.  Approach with caution.",1326153600,,1059,4.412371134020619
2928648,4,B000V3JGII,"The Movie Collection contains 5 films that the Coen Brothers are known for:  Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona and Fargo.

Blood Simple is the first film that gained recognition for the Coen Brothers.  It is the story of a double-cross and murder in a small town starring John Getz, Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya.

Barton Fink, starring John Turturro and Joyn Goodman, is a thriller set in 1940's Hollywood.

Miller's Crossing, starring Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Albert Finney and Marcia Gay Harden is the story of romantic triangles and honor among thieves in the 1930's.

Raising Arizona, starring Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter, is the story of a childless couple who are involved in a kidnapping scheme.

Fargo, a thriller, stars Frances McDormand in her Oscar winning performance with a wonderful supporting cast of Steve Buscemi and William H. Macy.

A great collection for any fan of the Coen Brothers films.  The only other Coen Brothers film that I could possible add to this great collection is their film, Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou? which is my favorite Coen Brothers film, starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson and John Goodman.",1304985600,,1195,5.087179487179487
2928649,5,B000V3JGII,"Bought as a gift for an old friend. He was thrilled to receive the collection and has enjoyed the films. Told me every time he watches one, he thinks of his old pal.",1265760000,,165,4.03030303030303
2928650,5,B000V3JGII,"We really enjoyed these. I had just recently got turned onto the Coen Brothers, and once I found that I liked many of their recent movies, I found this box set! Their older flicks are wonderful too!",1245801600,,198,4.378378378378378
2928651,5,B000V3JGII,"This collection contains terrific films.  The culminating wonder is Fargo but Raising Arizona, Barton Fink and Blood Simple are terrific too.  Miller's Crossing is not one of my favorites but others love it much more than I do.  All show an increasingly strong work of great filmmakers and skilled directors, producers and writers.  The actors do wonderful jobs too.  Everything is superlative.",1237593600,2,394,5.290322580645161
2928652,4,B000V3JGII,"I bought this set because BLOOD SIMPLE was impossible to find at the time.  The quality is alright, nothing special.

They are all good films, and the set is worth it for that reason alone.",1233014400,2,189,4.371428571428571
2928653,5,B000V3JGII,"The Coen Brothers are full of creativity and originality.  I have always been a fan of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"", but I only recently watched the other 3 in this collection.

I was mesmerized by the suspenseful ""Blood Simple"", and John Goodman gives an amazing performance in the thriller, ""Barton Fink"", which is now one of my favorites.  All of their movies are well-written and unique, so I will always be excited to see any new one they come out with.

This is a collection for a true fan of the suspense/noir/black comedy genres!",1230249600,3,538,4.691489361702128
2928654,4,B000V3JGII,The films in this set are very good.  We received the boxed set earlier than expected from Amazon and that was great.  Would recommend this set of films to anyone who are idols of the Coen Brothers.,1225756800,,198,4.324324324324325
2928655,5,B000V3JGII,This is a must have for Coen brothers fans.  Awesome collection of their earlier works.  The only missing piece is The Big Lebowski.  Alas this will be re-released again and again in various collector editions.  For the money this collection is your best bet.  You will surely watch all of these movies many times and love every minute.,1219968000,,336,4.724137931034483
2928656,4,B000V3JGII,"a good collection if you already have the big lebowski.
i purchased this collection because it was the deal of the day and priced at i recall $20 or so.
great for that price!",1216512000,,174,4.147058823529412
2928657,4,B000V3JGII,"It pains me to give this collection less than 5 stars, because these are unbelievably great films at what has (at times) been a great price. But in presenting ""Raising Arizona"" to friends and family last night, I was frustrated that I couldn't get the 16:9 picture to fill my HDTV screen. So I fiddled with controls on the DVD player and the TV set itself, continually failing to make the picture large enough (though the aspect ratio was fine). Only later did I find out that this is not a true 16:9 anamorphic transfer, but a ""letterboxed"" version - meaning you're only going to get a picture about half the size your television is capable of showing. I just checked ""Fargo,"" and it filled the screen nicely (though neither film has a really pristine transfer).  Does it sound like I'm nitpicking details? Maybe so - but it's only because these are COEN BROTHERS films, and are so close to being perfect that I'd like the technical side to live up to the films themselves. That being said, this is a terrific collection and highly recommended.",1215302400,20,1045,4.618279569892473
2928658,5,B000V3JGII,"If you love the Coen Brothers' movies...and who doesn't??!!......this is a great deal. You will always have something to watch. They are an American treasure, as far as I am concerned.",1214524800,,184,4.967741935483871
2928659,4,B000V3JGII,"I really like this collection. It's great for the price. I already had Fargo, but it was scratched, so it worked out. I cant get enough of that movie, its definitely a favorite. Miller's Crossing I had never seen, probably won't watch again for a while, a little boring, but still good. Barton Fink I had never seen, and I loved it, great movie. Raising Arizona I had never seen, also a little boring, but fun. And Blood Simple, I have seen once, awesome movie. I would definitely recommend this collection to any Coen Brothers fan.",1212537600,2,532,4.552083333333333
2928660,5,B000V3JGII,I bought this for my hubby and he had seen all of them except for Barton Fink.  He was pleasantly surprised at how well it stacked up to the other Coen Brothers movies.,1212364800,,168,4.090909090909091
2928661,5,B000V3JGII,"The purchase of ""Fargo"" alone was worth the price. Everything else is a bonus.",1212192000,2,78,4.642857142857143
2928662,4,B000V3JGII,"The Coen brothers -- Joel and Ethan -- burst onto the scene with 1984's ""Blood Simple"", a slow-moving noirish crime drama that expanded the universe of those films in ways most Americans were not familiar. For one thing, it wasn't clear right away what the crime was. Second, it wasn't clear who the crimial was. Third, as that guy stated in one of the film's great lines, ""Where's my jacket?"" indicated the complete irony every character found himself facing in this very original production.

And thus began the career of two of America's most celebrated filmmakers from the past 25 years. The Coen brothers grew up in Minneapolis and present a very Seinfeld-esque Midwestern view in their films, even those that take place in unnamed large cities including the oddball mobster movie ""Miller's Crossing"" or ""Barton Fink"", which begins in New York and moves onto Los Angeles.

The latter film -- always one of my favorite Coen brothers' works -- was almost completely misintrepreted by critics when it arrived in 1991. None could identify the obvious symbolism that it was about a conflicted playwright (John Turturro) who took his great success from New York's theater community and went West to become a screenwriter in Hollywood, where he encounters all sorts of evil including the Devil incarnate. Even during all these very unMidwestern transacations, the Coens stayed true to their upbringing and brought hardworking pull yourself up by your bootstraps elements to their movies, where every hero was challenged by the unusual, original and sometimes even the insurmountable. They did this even when  mixing film metaphors as they so often do.

The greatest advantage of this package is it includes none of their later higher gloss but emotionally empty movies with George Clooney. It I was the one packaging this, I'd have deleted ""Raising Arizona"" and added ""The Big Lebowski"", a better comedy and a film that features a much better cast than ""Arizona"". But that's small potatoes because, for less than $35, you have get a handful of the Coens' best early films for home enjoyment anytime you want, including their great masterpiece ""Fargo"", an American Film Institute top 100 movie that takes place in their hometown and is based on events that really happened.

So don't waste too much time if original filmmaking, clever writing, wonderful character acting, and originality are assets you seek in entertainment. Take advantage of one of the offers Amazon Marketplace provides you to get this package for a very attractive price and bring treasurable art into your home for consumption anytime you want.

2928663,4,B000V3JGII,"I became interested in the Coen brothers after seeing ""No Country for Old Men"". I had liked Fargo, but was unnerved by it and felt uncomfortable afterwards. I realize that this is exactly the reaction they were trying for.
So far, we've seen three of the other movies and while they were enjoyable, did not rise to the level of ""No Country""",1209772800,,340,4.5
2928664,5,B000V3JGII,"I've already seen all of these and own most of them, but this is a dynamite starter set for people who've only seen a couple of Coen films and want to go deeper.",1209513600,,161,3.909090909090909
2928665,5,B000V3JGII,"I had only seen Fargo and Raising Arizona prior to purchasing this set. I was not at all disappointed. Blood Simple was genius considering it was their first movie, Fargo is perfection, Millers Crossing was great, as are the other two. If you like the Coen brothers then I would highly recommend purchasing this set, even if you haven't seen all the flicks. While your at it, pick up The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men.",1208822400,,428,4.5
2928666,5,B000V3JGII,"Although for what it is you'd think they'd at least throw in the Hudsucker Proxy or Lebowski. Still, this was a great deal. Don't expect much in the way of extras, or even an accompanying booklet. But you get five great films at a more than reasonable price.",1207353600,3,258,4.395833333333333
2928667,5,B000V3JGII,"I bought this box set on Amazon for $24.99, it has since jumped up to $36.99 and this price working out the math of the individual movies, it may not make much sense to pick up this box set right now.  However, apparently, DVD prices fluctuate online and for the sake of this particular box set, I probably would have been willing to buy it for a max. of $40.00. That said, here is a terrific introduction to the Coen brothers. Here are their first five (critically acclaimed) movies. For your casual viewer, this is great. For your film junkie, this is slightly disappointing as  I don't think we will ever understand why distributing companies (aside from The Criterion Collection and a few others) can't seem to get the whole flow of making a box-set. For those who do not understand my complaint, the Hudsucker Proxy is missing from this box set, when chronologically it should come between Barton Fink and Fargo. But one has got to understand this selling what sells pattern most distributors follow.

I suggest watching the movies one after the other chronologically.  Given my schedule, it took me a little over a week to watch the movies. It is a joy to watch any filmmakers work like this. I am planning a similar viewing experience with director Spike Lee's movies in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spike-Lee-Joint-Collection-Clockers-Jungle-Fever-Do-the-Right-Thing-Mo-Better-Blues-Crooklyn/dp/B000E40QC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spike Lee Joint Collection (Clockers/ Jungle Fever/ Do the Right Thing/ Mo` Better Blues/ Crooklyn)</a>&nbsp;collection.

2928668,5,B000V3JGII,"I'll cut to the chase and say that these five films are the best films The Coen Brothers made from their early years.  ""Fargo"" is genius and should have won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director over ""The English Patient"" back in 1996; ""Miller's Crossing"" is the most original gangster film ever made; ""Barton Fink"" is one of the most original films ever made, period; ""Raising Arizona"" shows The Coen Brothers at their most hilarious and quirky best; and ""Blood Simple"" is a masterful and truly remarkable debut film.  While some might include ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" in place of some of the films listed here, we'll just have to wait for the second box set to come out which will undoubtedly include ""No Country for Old Men"" in the new collection.
