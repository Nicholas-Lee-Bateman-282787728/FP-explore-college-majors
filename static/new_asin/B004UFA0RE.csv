4466862,4,B004UFA0RE,"If you are on a diet, this is not the film for you.  Based on the memoirs of cook and writer Nigel Slater, the movie is a visual culinary feast, detailing his love of food.  Raised by a mother who could burn water, Nigel (played as a child by newcomer Oscar Kennedy and as an adolescent by Freddie Highmore) spends his time gazing lovingly at pictures of beautifully prepared dishes.  When Mum (Victoria Hamilton) passes away, his father (Ken Stott) takes up with Mrs. Potter (Helena Bonham Carter) who may be a tart, but she cooks like a french chef.  The rivalry between Nigel and Mrs. Potter forms the (pardon the pun) meat of the film, as each tries to one-up the other.  The leads are uniformly fine (it is especially fun to watch Bonham Carter in this after ""The King's Speech"").  WARNING: You may begin to feel much like Ken Stott does: overstuffed!  As an aside: I purchased this in the PAL format from amazon.co.uk for three pounds, ninety-nine pence, which translated roughly into $6.40.  Even with the additional shipping costs, that is a substantial savings.",1319587200,19,1070,4.684491978609626

4466882,5,B004UFA0RE,"Although not one to leave public opinion, I felt it wise to give my two cents in a review based on how good the movie was and how some of the other reviews read.  The English are known for many things, but sometimes cinema isn't their forte but this little sleeper seemed to really captivate and keep you hooked.  I have also been a longtime fan of Helena Bonham Carter because everything she act's in she sink's her teeth into and her portrayal of Mrs. Potter is no exception.  The movie is based on the life of chef Nigel Slater, his upbringing and his penchant for cooking which comes alive little by little.  As telling the story of his life, it showed bumps along the road with his stepmother as well as his budding homosexuality, which if I may say, was handled very delicately and sweetly.  I liked the fact that Slater determined early on he was gay and was ok with it and grew with it.  Some reviewers were put off by this subject matter, but the movie was autobiographical and chef Slater is gay in real life, so I just don't see what the problem is.  I applaud the story, the director, and the actor Freddie Highmore for giving this role a touch of reality.  And in reference to the scene where the gardener strips and shows his butt and we see young Slater's reaction, that brought back so many memories that I had been in the same situation somewhat in my early youth that brought me to where I am today.  I guess some movie watcher's think that the world is perfect and everyone is straight, which we all know is false.  The movie had a great ending, Nigel finally makes it clear to Mrs. Potter that she will not be part of his future life and ends with his first job, which I must say was a very good one.

There's alot of meanness between characters .If they had tweaked the story a bit it could have been a light hearted celebration of the evolution of a food critic. Instead it was a painful pity party of a story that I didn't get through because I lost interest when 2 guys started kissing ( & one of them seems to be under 20 ). It seemed to me to be very cliche.

4466896,3,B004UFA0RE,"I hate it when the trailer gives you all the cute bits but fails to grant a realistic portrayal of the film.  Being irritated, this may not be a fair
review.

I'm a fan of Freddie Highmore and Helena Bonham Carter, so bought it based on their acting ability, the trailer, and the interesting title.

The story is the  horrible childhood and ultimate freedom and growth of a gentleman named Nigel Slater who became one of Britain's top chefs based on his autobiography.  Had I read it, or perhaps read the reviews, I would have had more sympathy rather than agony;
2/3 of the film was with a very good younger actor playing Nigel, but I was waiting to see Freddie, who was also very good - subtle and
sensitive.

So, Nigel was a single child in a middle class British family with a stay at home mom who really, really could not  cook, and had an innate fear of real, live, fresh food, buying only safe canned goods.  One of the funny bits was that, to prepare dinner, she put three unopened cans of various ? into a pot of  boiling water to heat them up, but managed to cook off the water and burn them to inedibility!  However, she loved Nigel in her own soft, quiet way, and did spend time with him, taking him dancing, and even (gasp!) trying to cook with him.
Nigel was born to taste and enjoy food, a sensuality that was doomed in this household, however, it was his strength, and no one, not even his father, who really seemed to just need ease and peace, but  would get abusively angry at his son just for speaking up, quite
managed to kill that deep hunger.

This was a time, at least in the middle class, when children were just not regarded as human beings apparently, and telling them the
truth, or sharing realities and reasons with  them was not regarded as at all necessary.  This part was very painful for me and is why I
probably will not see this film again.  The mother was ill, though  no one would explain that to Nigel , and the father kept blaming him
for any problem. I think he, Nigel, managed to get through with the down to earth attitude and observations (though not always accurate) of a good school chum.  This interaction also provided some humor.  However, the mother dies when he is still young, probably a preteen, making relations unmitigatedly worse with his now lonesome and grieving father.

How HBCarter enters the scene as the new housemaid and this IS very funny!  She seems to just flourish in this zany role, making it
delightful.  However, she, Mrs. Potter, has more than the intention to keep their house really clean, and you will see some clever sexual allusions in her cleaning which definitely start to perk Daddy up.  On the good side, she is an extraordinary cook, regaling Nigel and
Daddy with wonderful, often rich creations from entree to desert, which I would say at least opened up the culinary universe for Nigel.
But there was a dark side, which was confusing and not understandable to me:  as the family's relationship evolved, she became antagonistic to Nigel's attempts to learn to  cook and contribute, and created an outright competitive,adversarial relationship with him, working to outshine him at every turn. Poor Mr. Slater is the unfortunate target (or waste bin) of all this extravagant fare, getting too much food too often, and ending up dead from it one day.  Mrs. Potter, now Mrs. Slater, has created such an unloving relationship
with Nigel that she can't undo it and pretend they can live together the two of them as a family.  He has a very interesting rod of inner
strength which never really weakens, though he reaches out for happiness and love without real success, several others at least tell him he will be alright.  Perhaps this was just enough encouragement coupled with growing up just enough to realize his success in life depended upon leaving his crazy ""family"" .  He does, and becomes Nigel Slater, Chef.",1468886400,,3892,4.593342981186686

4466898,5,B004UFA0RE,"This is a true story about Nigel Slater who rose to fame with cuisine expertise as a Chef and well-known Commentator on Television especially the BBC.  Nigel Slater's rise to fame was marked by tragedy in his youth as a boy, teenager and young adult.  The boy star - Oscar Kennedy - was a display of precocious Genius who portrayed a lonely boy who lost his Mother to illness and clung to his Father in despair.  However, his Father portrayed by Tim Stott was a successful professional and re-married.  Helena Bonham Carter played the part of the Step-Mother in superb fashion
who Nigel could never bond with.  Then the next prodigy of the young Actors, Freddie Highmore, portrayed Nigel as a Teenager.  Young Nigel in High School excelled in Home Economics as a Chef apprentice - and even had part-time jobs in nearby local residents.  He had a very positive friendship with one of the chefs, whom he turned to in grief when his Father died suddenly.  There is one scene where Nigel the grieving Teenager had a session of kissing his friend the chef and begged not to be left alone.  But his friend, the Chef is married and sent Nigel off to the prestigious Savoy Hotel with a reference to be apprenticed.  Nigel goes home, packs his suitcase and leaves his Step-Mother - Mrs. Potter - never to be seen again.  He is accepted as an apprentice chef and Nigel's career began and succeeded due to his merits of character, young lad maturity and self-earned accomplishments.  The young boy actor, Oscar Kennedy and the young lad actor Freddie Highmore are exemplars of true genius in acting out their roles in the film.  I found this film a real asset to show to a young boy who lost a parent and he could carry on with life.  Furthermore, the most accomplished persons worthy of fame and success are those who earned it by their own merits, abilities, character and accomplishments.  No one has to be born into economic and social privilege with the right last name.  This DVD has real value in my collection.  This biographical DVD of Nigel Slater should be an inspiration to all who learn tragedy can visit any age of a person but can be overcome.",1456531200,3,2147,4.593175853018373

4466900,2,B004UFA0RE,"The first hour of the film is devoted to exposing the joyless world of the English middle classes, one ordinary family unit in particular. Loving mother, daft in general, hopelessly stupid in the kitchen. Gruff old fashioned father who believes in child rearing by verbal abuse, hopelessly stupid in the kitchen. A young son, a nasty snobby little twit who grows throughout the film into a worse snobby teenage twit. He likes and relishes the nuances of food, and learns to cook in school because, it turns out, he's also hopelessly stupid in the kitchen at home...Has none of the instinctive know-how of a natural cook.

Mother dies, and into this world (for the last 1/3 of the movie) enters a vivacious and generous cleaning woman who also likes and relishes the nuances of food, and is an accomplished and natural cook to boot. She's greatly appreciated by the father, but hated by the snobby little twit who cannot see anything beyond the fog of his narrow mindedness (excused by 'defending the memory of the mother' self delusion) They enter into a silly competition over who can cook better. Father eventually dies of overeating, as expected.  Nasty snobby teenager then abandons stepmother, with a malicious smirk on his face. Grows up to be, we're told, a well known food writer. I can just imagine his reviews....We're also told he never saw his stepmother again. Well, I hope she kept the house and opened a one of a kind B&B!!

4466920,4,B004UFA0RE,"This 2010 TV movie boasts some gently adult British humor centered around a petulant schoolboy who just wants a decent meal...and maybe some fresh vegetables. His ailing mother is strictly a canned peas kind of cook but she usually has to fall back to fresh toast.

Inspired by food writer, television personality and journalist Nigel Slater's memoir, this bio-pic set in the 1960s is all about FOOD. You've never seen cooking like his mum's; it's no wonder he wanted to do it himself. But wait until the cooking competition starts between him and his new step-mother.

Director S.J. Clarkson (""Bates Motel"") used these ingredients:
  * Oscar Kennedy (Lots of TV) is young Nigel Slater, frustrated by his mother's cooking, his dad's short temper, and misled by a school chum's worldly advice.
  * Freddie Highmore (""August Rush"") is adolescent Nigel, daring to follow his bliss and still striving for his father's approval.
  * Ken Stott (""One Day"") is Dad, suffering from loneliness, bad digestion and a rebellious son.
  * Victoria Hamilton (""Lark Rise to Candleford"") is Mum, it's no wonder she can't cook, she's very ill.
  * Helen Bonham Carter (""The King's Speech"") is Mrs. Potter, that upstart from Council (Public) Housing who shows up in Nigel's home and seduces his father with her suggestive housekeeping moves. (You have to see it to believe it.)

Of major note is a beautiful father/son montage backed by Dusty Springfield singing ""If You Go Away"" that illustrates how much both of these fellows miss Mum.

4466924,2,B004UFA0RE,"'Toast' - the book by the renowned columnist and food writer Nigel Slater is well worth a read - and describes his childhood memories growing up in the West Midlands, England. Born in 1958, the book covers the 1960s - a relatively bleak time in Britain, I well recall, and 1970s. For those of us born at the same time - many of the delightful memories are shared - with each chapter often centered around food (which for the British was a dismal culinary time), there are numerous 'laugh out loud' passages. Certainly, Slater's book - indeed his life - was touched by sadness, with the death of his Mum by asthma when he was nine years old - but the book is up beat and intimate.

For me, translation to film did not capture the spirit of the book - and I found it largely sad and awkward. Certainly well acted - with wonderful scenery backdrops and delightful period music, I never truly warmed to the characters nor saw my own British past (certainly a very different one - but over the very same period in England) within the film, as I had the book.

The days of 'Harold Wilson' and a largely grey and white Britain have fortunately past by - with the decline of Britain as an industrial and leading political center. It appears to now be a far more colorful country that has found a new role and direction. The film and book cover this change through the eyes of a small child struggling with his dysfunctional family. The book covers this far better - the film far less so - but it's still worth a view..... The book is a ""must read"" and should be considered first.",1395273600,4,1571,4.376712328767123

4466929,4,B004UFA0RE,"This is a movie about emotion that finds expression through food, in both good and bad ways.  The title itself should be a giveaway!  Set in the 1960's, the costumes and vintage background in this movie are wonderful to look at, plus the actors do a good job--especially one of my favorites, Helena Bonham Carter as the up-and-coming Mrs Potter.  It can be a bit slow at times, but I really did enjoy it.

Some Spoilers:

Nigel is a young man who grows up in a middle-class household where his father works and his mother stays home and can't cook.  Yes, that's right...she can barely make toast.  In fact, this is what they tend to eat most of the time.  Nigel, on the other hand, is fixated on food, on food they've never had and never tasted, and that he longs for.  More than anything, this longing for food is a longing for more affection from his distant father and his neurotic mother who means well, but is just too delicate.

When his mother dies, his father hires a cleaning lady/cook, Mrs Potter, who insinuates her way into their life by means of her wonderful dishes.  After all, the way to a man is through his stomach, right?  Nigel can't stand to have this woman replace his mother, so he starts competing with Mrs Potter in the cooking dept and his father ends up caught in the middle.

Some funny bits in the movie include Nigel joining the girls in Home Economics and out-cooking the lot of them.  Also, the battle of the lemon meringue pies.  But, overall, this movie has a bittersweet, even sad quality to it...especially by the end when it becomes obvious that food doesn't just mean emotional security to Nigel and his father, but to Mrs Potter, as well.

Not really a kid's movie.  I'm not sure this is a keeper, but I think its worth watching once if you enjoy food and cooking and movies set in the 1960's...which I do.  Or if you are a fan of Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Mrs Potter to perfection.",1389657600,,1927,4.426136363636363

4466940,5,B004UFA0RE,"If ever there was a movie that told the story of ""how to turn lemons into lemonade"", `Toast' may well fit the bill.

`Toast' is the joyful, and at times painful story of Nigel who dreams - of cooking, of a perfect family and much more.  Truly a triumphant story telling of a true story, the films brings to life the story of a young man, coming of age ever so quickly after losing his beloved mother at a young age.  The insanity follows as his father mostly incapable of emotion falls for a married cleaning lady (Mrs. Potter) who knows how to cook, and smoke.  A series of life events leads our young Nigel into rapid adulthood.

Throughout the film, the music of Dusty Springfield (featuring tracks from her album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-Am-I-Going/dp/B0000087ID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where Am I Going</a>) embraces the viewer and carries us away with Nigel.  As the film nears its end, Nigel steals a chance at love, and the scene is certain to bring back every 40+ something man memories of his first time (I'm intentionally being vague).

`Toast' is a heartwarming tale that can inspire us to remember we truly can do anything we want in life if we dream a little and take a big chance.  Obviously I enjoyed the film, but I could understand if some found it a tad slow in the middle.

Nigel grows to have a fascination with food and cooking, and when his mother dies from asthma and his father soon after starts dating the cleaning lady (Bonham Carter) - who can cook like a professional chef - Nigel takes up the gauntlet to out-do her.

Got that he ""likes boys"" early on (and women a good deal less) even without the idolized gardner's bum shot and stilted, uncomfortably inserted piggyback ride, and the oddly inserted ""ballerina/cook kissing scene""... and did I mention, someone doesn't like girls? to then add the ""pouf"" name calling by a bullying female character, then the mean (female) teacher who makes him drink his milk and upsets his stomach - he, of course vomits on her. Then, we have bad little girl wants to show him her ""knickers"". Please, I see the trend. Felt like I was beaten to death with this theme, right to the end.

Kennedy/Freddy Highmore/Nigel Slater was ""there"" but so boring,drab and colorless. I didn't care for the early on or the older Nigel. I just came away feeling was that the character was bratty, haughty and unlikeable.

There was no real bright spot in the film. Sad.

Helena Bonham Carter was fun to watch, as always and gave it her best to round out Mrs. Potter (and frankly, made her more of an appealing character than Nigel). Stott as ""Mr. Slater"" was pretty forgettable too. The plot mechanisms were boring and contrived. It was drawn out and sluggish.

4466947,5,B004UFA0RE,"Nigel Slater, famed British food critic and about-town culinary ace,has provided a solid, respectful subject for this bio-pic.  A disclaimer tells us that the film is based upon true events.

  This BBC production,starring Helena Bonham Carter, is a film certainly worth viewing--a story, we're told, of a young man's journey into successful adulthood. Alas, it was not easy, as young Nigel loses him mother early on and is soon replaced by Mrs. Potter (""She's our cleaner,"" young Nigel tells guests at a social gathering.)  From the day Mrs. Potter (Carter) is hired, the rivalry between Nigel and her over the affections of his father become more acute as each month goes by--they compete with each other by trying to outdo each other's cooking.  There is no love lost between them.  Eventually, Nigel's father dies (clearly from overeating!) and Nigel then frees himself to pursue a dream--his love of cooking. And he's finally free of Mrs. Potter.

  Along the way, as the film shows, we find highs and lows for him, some funny instances and many not-so-funny.  One has to empathize with him, for certainly he feels he has ""the ugly stepmother"" with whom to contend, although, of course, Carter is anything but ugly. Throughout the film, viewers root for some type of rapprochement between the two--but it never happens, sad to say.  Still, the film captures some terrifically poignant moments--with excellent dialogue, good editing, and quality acting.  I was unfamiliar with the movie until I accidentally ran across a trailer. I wasn't disappointed in the film.  Carter was outstanding, especially, and quite convincing as the step-mother.

4466959,4,B004UFA0RE,"""Billy Elliot"" writer Lee Hall is an important factor in the success of this BBC TV production ,based on Nigel Slaters' well regarded memoir;he has delivered a well written and perceptive script that goes a long way to ensuring this is an evocative and engaging piece of work ,and one honest enough to suggest that Mr Slater has some  less than admirable traits.

Oscar Kennedy -11 years old at the time,and making his debut,and doing it splendidly - plays the young Nigel,only child of middle class parents in Wolverhampton in the English West Midlands. His businessman father (Ken Stott)is hard working but austere and remote;his mother (Victoria Hamilton)is warm ,loving and a doting parent. However,she is a monumentally incompetent cook and toast is the staple diet in the household. She dies when Nigel,who had worshipped her unconditionally ,is still a very young boy. Her place is taken by the blowsy family  cleaning lady/cook ""Mrs Potter""(Violet Bonham-Carter,looking a perfect vision in Crimplene).She is the polar opposite of his mother-""common"",given to revealing ample amounts of cleavage and sporting a natty line stocking tops. She can also cook like a dream. As Nigel's own passion for food and cooking develops the two engage in a culinary battle for the affections of his father.(By this part of the programme ,Nigel is being played by the estimable Freddie Highmore)

The show does not put a foot wrong;it is splendidly acted,has a winning soundtrack in which the great Dusty Springfield is prominent and features art direction which precisely depicts the drabness of English provincial life before the 60's began to swing. It does not shy away from addressing the class and cultural snobbery which still disfigures the British bourgeoisie and does not disguise the fact that its protagonist is ,in some ways a prissy little prig. I can but assume Mr Slater was happy with the depiction of his younger self ,as he makes a cameo appearance in the programme.

4466963,5,B004UFA0RE,"Although the wonderfully directed, acted and nostalgic film ""Toast""  set in the early 1960s has some very funny moments (i.e., the mother's attempts at cooking and, most of all, Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of a housekeeper/cook and would/soon be love interest),  I found this film to be a very touching and a very tender ""coming of age"" film.  The film is the true story of British food critic Nigel Slater's life from childhood to his teens when he struck out on his own in the ""food business"".

""Middle class"", Nigel (brilliantly acted by Oscar Kennedy--Nigel as child and Freddie Highmore--Nigel as teen) is shown as a rather precocious almost irritating brat that deeply loves his sickly mom and loves food  and is not too excepting of his father's ackward attempts at love (greatly acted by Ken Stott).  Nigel  has very poor exposure to good food and its preparation thereof until the ""wild"" and very competitive housekeeper (and eventually stepmom) comes along--wonderfully played by (as a ""brassy"" blond) Helena Bonham Carter.

This film certainly captures the early 1960s (clothes, soundtrack, etc) so very well.  I was really drawn into this story of Nigel and his longings to be loved by his father and to find love and recognition through the fine preparation of food.  There is also a glimpse of his ""first kiss"" with a fellow helper in a kitchen where he is working.

All in all, I really enjoyed this film mainly because it's so well acted.

Helena's character goes from being a swinging, smoking, amusing hussy of a housekeeper to a competitive and mean spirited step-mother, vying with a teenage boy for his father's attention by out-cooking him.

When her illness finally gets the best of her, young Nigel and his father welcome a new addition to the family in the form of a housekeeper named Mrs. Potter, who soon wins over Nigel's father and engages Nigel himself in a sort of ongoing culinary rivalry.

The opening credits sort of tell us this will happen with the actors names on various supermarket products and the one with his name on it has ""and with 10% Freddie Highmore"". He plays the older version of the main character Nigel, the majority of the movie Nigel is played by Oscar Kennedy, who is also still currently appearing in plenty of TV shows, but none which have had the impact of Bates Motel or The Good Doctor on mainstream audience numbers. The younger actor has more of a meaty role than Highmore does, having to cope with the death of his mother early on in the film, an abusive father who blames him for anything going wrong in the household, a psychopathic cleaning lady trying to seduce his father for his money I guess, as he doesn't seem to have anything personality or looks wise to offer, and primary school life.  The movie just jumps a number of years into the future with Highmore sitting at the kitchen table and being referred to as Nigel by the father.  Not sure why they didn't stick with Kennedy since he'd carried the film up to then, we know Highmore can act, but he isn't really given anything to do here.  The most he has to do is put his hand up to be enrolled in home economics instead of metal work or something when his classmates and teacher look on in shock wanting to know if he's joking.  The movie is set in 1960's Britain, where I guess this wasn't what anyone did.  The movie also doesn't fill in the gaps, Nigel had friends and seemed somewhat popular at school, but the Highmore version suddenly has no friends.  His dad doesn't seem to hate him so much either.

Overall the movie doesn't explain why if the cleaning lady is known throughout the town as a great cook, she is a cleaning lady and not being hired by at least a diner or take away restaurant if not a better restaurant or has started her own business?  Obviously Nigel's dad would believe she's a great cook since his previous wife just put unopened cans into boiling water and would never touch anything fresh, but other character's in the story refer to her as a great cook too. Spoilers follow - Even when Nigel starts to cook she see this as a threat, knowing that's all she has to offer and probably thinking she'll be dumped by his father if Nigel can now meet her food  level expertise.  You guess early on what her plan is when she first starts the cleaning gig, but why take so long to carry it out?  Nerves?  Why not embrace Nigel's desire to cook so she can frame him later?

For me there wasn't enough happening in the movie to rate it any higher and the unanswered questions also keep that rating low.  Although I've loved Highmore in Bates, Good Doctor and other stuff, there didn't seem to be any point to him replacing the other actor near the end of the film, and him suddenly being in it doesn't add anything to the film because he doesn't do much other than carry home various food dishes he cooked at the school.

8441465,3,B004UFA0RE,"Not so much impressive. I expected more to the story. I felt the message was weak. I guess toast made by mother is supposed to symbolize something special to the boy,  but it was not so much well dipicted. But this movie was interesting to me, in that the boy and his stepmother were competing each other to win the boy's father with their meal.",1515196800,,345,4.3076923076923075

8441467,2,B004UFA0RE,The protagonist is a bitter selfish boy who misderects the anger over his mothers death towards his new step mother. She is a woman desperate to be loved who then also becomes bitter and resentful towards him in turn because there is only so much constant rejection a person can take. The relationship never resolved constructively and somehow that deeply troubled boy grew up to be the man who wrote this story and I feel worried that he must somehow have thought himself to be the hero of this tale rather than the narcissistic and destructive monster he apparently is.,1511568000,3,571,4.72

8441469,4,B004UFA0RE,Some reviewers said this was funny but I didn't find it funny at all. Nigel is a strong boy who dealt with the blows life gave to him. Interesting film but no laughs at all. Sad more than funny.,1509494400,,194,4.0
