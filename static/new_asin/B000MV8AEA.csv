2750103,1,B000MV8AEA,"I paid 29 cents for this film (used) and I feel completely ripped off.  This one is horrendous...horrible acting...no script...totally boring...moves at a snail's pace...and should be avoided at all cost.  The box cover art is also a rip-off.  There's no such scene in the film.  Tracy Nelson's performance is less than inspiring.  She's in the wrong field.  She should be a clerk at the DMV.  Even if someone gives you this film free of charge, refuse it.  You could do much better watching TV commercials for 93 minutes.  No kidding.  This one belongs in the trash...which is where I placed it less than 30 seconds after I retrieved it from my DVD player.",1281830400,3,657,4.684210526315789

8172723,4,B000MV8AEA,"The Rival is an originally made for TV movie from 2006.  Like most this follows the formula of having a DVD cover with an image that is not in the movie, as well as using well recognised faces from popular TV shows to get the investors and viewers.  This one uses Heather Tom (Katie Forrester - The Bold and the Beautiful, Victoria - The Young and the Restless), as a woman in need of some cash to pay her debt and look after her daughter, who is asked by her cousin to be a surrogate mother for her work colleague and his wife.  The Millers are having trouble finding a surrogate because the wife (Tracy Nelson, been in a fair few made for TV movies but best known as George's girlfriend who he ultimately worked out looked like and was a female version of Jerry on an episode of Seinfeld) is very picky and insists the surrogate lives with them for the nine months. Of course no one told the surrogate that Mrs Miller, was a paranoid nutjob who's aunt in a nursing home she hates is demanding she let her live with them, and threatens to divulge to the husband what she did to her father when a child, while constantly telling her he will leave her for the surrogate when the baby is born.

It's a good film if you can suspend belief, as you're quickly wondering why anyone who comes in contact with the wife would ever go along with any plans of letting her be around a kid, let alone take possession of a baby, she's just that mentally unstable a character. Jenna Wheeler-Hughes as the surrogate's ten year old or whatever age daughter does a pretty good job.  Also stars Linden Ashby (Teen Wolf TV series),  Barbara Niven (Murder She Baked and lots of other TV movies).",1494892800,,1674,4.3493589743589745

8172729,4,B000MV8AEA,"When Alice, a deeply disturbed woman with a dark past, is shot in a robbery, she loses the only thing she's ever really wanted...the baby she carries in her womb. Driven by the desire to be a mother, she focuses on rebuilding her life with the help of a therapist and her new husband, George, the man of her dreams.

Obsessed with motherhood, Alice and George find Jennifer, a beautiful young surrogate who agrees to live with them during the pregnancy. That's when everything begins to change. Alice becomes enraged with jealousy and finds herself consumed with the fear that George may leave her for the surrogate.

As Alice is pulled to the edge of insanity, the secrets of her horrific past rear their ugly heads and Alice is forced to extremes to hold on to the one thing she's wanted - the baby - even if it means murdering anyone who gets in her way.",1390780800,,857,4.487179487179487
