2369822,5,B000A6T05U,I really enjoyed this ab workout.  Allie is very easy to follow and cues her moves well.  I was actually surprised at the intensity of this video.  The workout moves were varied and the instruction on the video was great!,1149033600,5,221,4.475
2369823,5,B000A6T05U,"Wow, that was different! This workout has some neat moves to work your abs. It starts with some mild cardio and strength moves to get the blood flowing and warm the core, then moves to some work sitting on a tall step, then planks, then pilates inspired moves, then some (yep, even this one has 'em) crunches at the end. Allie is a fabulous, perky instructor who cues well and tells you what to do and seems to tell you what not to do when you're doing the wrong thing (""Shoulders back! Don't do this!""). Abdominal work is not my favorite thing, but this DVD is becoming one of my favorite sculpts. That's saying A LOT for how fun this is.",1144195200,15,639,4.289256198347108
2369824,4,B000A6T05U,"Please excuse my silly title, but this dvd is a must if your trying to get your abs in shape!  It is awesome.  I first do the Supercharged Sculpting, cut out the abs section of that which is conveniently at the end and do this one right after.  It rocks, good moves, fun music and very challenging.  Alli gives great direction, and you get to do some really nice stretches in between excercises!  You can't go wrong with this one, I actually look forward to doing it!",1142985600,14,467,4.32183908045977
2369884,5,B000A6T05U,"Okay, here's my confession -- I'm a pretty quick give-upper-er. If a video doesn't capture my attention and hold it, or it seems to complicated, hard -- well, I can find any excuse to give up on working out. I was very impressed with Jiggle Free Abs. I have already done the workout every other day 8 times. (It promises real results after 10) -- I feel fitter, made noticable progress quickly, and was able/am able to follow the routine all the way through. I like Allie Del Rio -- she gives very clear cues, she's motivating, but she doesn't have that overly chipper cheerleader vibe that makes me hit the mute button. I would definitely recommend this video. I'm pretty critical and I'm a fan. Just when you think you can't do one more rep of a particular exercise, or you just don't want to, she moves to another. It'll keep you going to the last sec.",1397347200,,855,4.417721518987341
2369885,3,B000A6T05U,"Jiggle Free Abs is a decent video if you want to get a quick work out in and raise your heart rate. At only 25 minutes, it's very short. However, I didn't realize that I'd need to have the Transfirmer to properly do this video. I don't have that particular piece of equipment, so I use my Firm Wave instead. I'll keep this video do have in case I'm in a rush, or want to do an abs-focused video.",1366156800,2,395,4.012658227848101
2369886,2,B000A6T05U,"This DVD arrived looking fine but was scratched. I don't know when it got scratched, since it was supposed to be NEW. It was a gift and I had to reorder from another company and give the gift after the birthday. The company did refund all my money.",1317427200,,248,4.1875
2369887,5,B000A6T05U,"I had watched the firm series in college and when I graduated and wanted to own it because I wanted to do a workout that would keep me motivated by providing results. Many reviewers talk about the old firm tapes and how they are more true to form. (Honestly I would totally agree. My major problem is the high impact nature of some moves but I enjoy the older tapes because they have less dance moves.) That being said, although I think the instructor usually is a little too ""dancey"" for me, I love this one. Really tough. Has sitting down and floor moves. Its really short. When I'm too tired to do a longer tape, or if I've already walked or run and want some ab toning I will do this. I like the modifications but honestly its the reps that kill you more so than the strain of any one move. This is quickly becoming my 2nd favorite firm workout.",1312675200,7,849,4.246913580246914
2369888,1,B000A6T05U,"I really don't like this routine. This has to be one of the lower end productions by the Firm. There are more hip flexor exercises then anything else, I highly recommend ""more 5 day abs"" for an efficient and focused abdominal workout.",1285372800,5,234,4.595238095238095
2369889,1,B000A6T05U,"Why is all 4 DVD's that come with the whole series advertised as if it is being sold when only the 1 DVD, ""Jiggle Free Abs"", is talked about in the description to be sold?  Correct me if I'm wrong but the title of the product is exaggerated if not falsely advertised.",1262908800,,267,4.134615384615385
2369890,5,B000A6T05U,I really enjoy this ab workout. I appreciate the different moves which are done standing and on the transfirmer. It is a great change of pace from strickly doing floor ab work. The music is fun and motivating along with the instructor Allie who is great and motivating as well. I really enjoy the transfirmer workouts and this has been a great add on to my collection. I definitely recommend this workout if you are looking for a creative way to work your abs.,1208995200,,460,4.488095238095238
2369891,5,B000A6T05U,In 30 minutes I can get a good ab workout.  I am an active person who works out no less than 5 days a week.  It takes you from standing to sitting to laying down.  You work out all areas.  It is good for beginners and helps keep other active and toned if you can't get to the gym.,1205798400,4,280,3.694915254237288
2369892,5,B000A6T05U,"It's challenging, and it seems to target multiple areas for an all around good workout of the abs. Only time will tell how it works for me, every  person is different. (Having 2 kids has totally destroyed my abs..)

I'll update later..",1204848000,2,235,4.571428571428571
2369893,5,B000A6T05U,"Allie is my favorite Firm instructor.  And Jiggle Free Abs has become one of my favorite Firm workouts.  I actually enjoy it.  There are a variety of exercises that work your whole core so you're not on the floor just doing crunches.  It's short (under 30 minutes) and focuses only on abs.  The Transfirmer is recommended, but not really necessary.  A chair will do.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, all over core workout.",1204416000,,446,4.641025641025641
2369894,5,B000A6T05U,"I really love this workout.  It isn't overly difficut to master but it seems to concentrate perfectly on my problem areas.  It is also intense enough for me that I noticed the difference in my abs within my first month of use.  I like the instructor.  She is focused and cheerful which is nice when she is the first thing I am looking at to motivate me at 5 a.m.  I wouldn't mind a little more length in the workout but I think it is still an excellent good workout and the plus side is that you can fit it in when you only have 30 minutes available in your schedule.  I would highly recommend it, especially for those who have a pooch that has appeared in their lower abdominal area (after child birth or when approaching their 40s).  I speak from experience.",1202428800,3,760,4.2727272727272725
2369895,5,B000A6T05U,"I used to hate to exercise, and believe me, I have tried to exercise and like it.  I have joined the gym, and done a wide variety of videos... I have danced with Cher,  sweated to the oldies, worked my core with pilates, and tried to slim down in six. I got results, but nothing to get too excited about.  As you might expect, I would just give up.  Was it boredom, or lack of time?  Was it laziness, or some other excuse?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  The fault is and always has been mine.

But, the Firm approach is the one that I can stick to.  Jiggle Free Abs is an incredibly effective routine.  I would never do 25 minutes of crunches on the floor, but I can lunge, twist, punch, squeeze and yes even crunch with Allie Del Rio (my favorite firm instructor).  I rotate Jiggle Free Abs with other Firm transfirmer DVD's.

One of the things I like best about the 7 Firm DVD's that I have tried, is that they do not waste your time.  If I am going to spend 25, or even 55 minutes exercising, then I want results.  Even when I was just starting out, I could do a modify version of most of the moves, but still push myself to get a good workout.  For me, the Firm workouts, and Allie Dlel Rio are the best.

A final word of caution:  I find that most Firm routines are a bit hard on the knees.  Be careful.",1190419200,5,1299,4.047244094488189
2369896,1,B000A6T05U,"Jiggle Free arms, you would think, that it will be thorough with your arms? there is more cardio-work out here which wasn't my purpose for purchasing this work-out. . also, i missed the fine print that you need the steps. you tend to drag time by transitioning different positions of the step. I was not looking for a step exercise. i shredded this dvd.

Instructor  bored the hell out of me.

2369897,5,B000A6T05U,"I am a Firm Believer.  I've been working out with The Firm for several years.  When the Jiggle Free Series came out, I was interested in finding out what it had to offer.  I have the Fanny Lifter (love it) and didn't want to purchase the new Transfirmer.  I bought Jiggle Free Abs here on Amazon.com for pretty cheap price.  It's an awesome abs workout.  Allie is one of The Firm's best instructors.  She continuously instruct you on proper form and breathing techniques.  The moves are challenging but do-a-ble.  I wasn't able to complete the full workout the first couple of times.  You don't need the Transfirmer, if you have a stool or the Fanny Lifter, you'll do just fine.  You only use it a few times in the beginning and that's it.  Here's what you get:  A 7 min. warm-up, a 16 min. abs routine, and a brief cool-down at the end and that's it.  Stick with it and you'll see results really fast.  I love the work out.  I also plan on buying Jiggle Free Arms, I heard it's an awesome workout as well.  Good luck.",1179878400,11,1018,4.329787234042553
2369898,3,B000A6T05U,"This is not a traditional floor ab routine with just crunches; I liked how there was a lot of variety of different moves.  However, I was dissapointed that many of the non-Floor exercises just didn't target the abs much, so my abs didn't feel sore during or after the workout.  Also, I'm concerned that many of the movements are high risk for injury.

The instructor is motivating, does the motions with good form, and gives good cueing about what motion to do next.  However, she doesn't give enough reminders about posture and keeping your abs tucked in.  The music, set, and video quality is good.

It's annoying that this DVD doesn't allow you to forward to specific chapters/sections (e.g. skip the Intro/Welcome chatter & Warmup segment)

summary of moves...

~10min WARM UP:

Light standing cardio workout moves. (which begninners may find mildly challenging, but will be easy for advanced).

There are lots of fast lunges, knee lifts, and body twists that might not be suitable for beginners because it's hard on the knees and back.

Except for a few exercises, most of the motions don't isolate/target the abs specifically.

~10min TRANSFIRMER(on a step/stool):

Back leg lifts alternating with too many hamstring stretches

Lean sideways while sitting on step

Oblique twists with alternate leg

Reverse crunches while sitting on the step

~10min FLOOR:

Reverse crunches w/ leg shoot combos

Plank (on the side)

Sit Backs w/ leg lifts

Tranditional crunches w/ oblique twists

Circle crunches

Side crunch while laying on side

Superman

STRETCHES",1174867200,28,1559,5.091269841269841
2369899,3,B000A6T05U,"It is nice because it focuses only on abs and doesn't need any other tools etc. I take it with me when I travel around and it is easy to follow. It does work if you really stick with it, I do it three times a week and it is quite effective.",1174435200,3,240,3.6346153846153846
2369900,5,B000A6T05U,"Allie's so cute when she says ""tummy.""  This is a very nice ab workout. Pair it with Jiggle Free Arms and you're set for the day! Oh, and for more challenge, do the planks directly on the floor and continue to work even while she's stretching. (for the first portion after the warm-up)",1174262400,2,285,4.377358490566038
2369901,5,B000A6T05U,"I have been doing Firm workouts for a couple of years now and I love how they target my problem areas.  I use the Body Sculpting System 2, and have always been a little disappointed with the lack of good ab exercises on 2 of the 3 videos.  They really hit the mark with this DVD though!  This is a great extra video to add to my normal routine.  It's short (25 min) and sweet (gets right to the point).  Even though I don't own the TransFirmer, I use my step from the Body Sculpting System 2.  But if you don't have a step, with this workout, you could use a sturdy chair.  No other equipment required.  I love that!",1173830400,6,616,4.075
2369902,5,B000A6T05U,"YES, she gives me awesome abs from this killer work out.  i can do it all now though and still love using it once a week!  i love the new ideas.",1173139200,3,144,3.6129032258064515
2369903,5,B000A6T05U,"An excellent workout... it focuses on developing your abs from all angles, even developing your back muscles along with core strength. Half the video isn't even working your abs on the floor. This short workout is jam packed with fun, creative, innovative moves. Remember though, you cannot spot reduce, so you need to add in some cardio to your daily workouts to burn fat, and this video will then take care of the toning. The Firm is a great system, I have lost 60 pounds (and counting) doing Firm workouts 4-5 times a week (I do not go to the gym, I just workout at home) and eating a healthy diet. I highly recommend this ab workout along with Firm Abs which is part of the BSS2 Firm System.",1152316800,8,695,4.395348837209302

Only issue is it doesn't mention you need the transfirmer boxes but don't be discouraged, feel free to use your couch or a table or maybe a low stool instead. The transfirmer step isn't necessary for this one but the better one for abs is the supercharged sculpting. You need the step for that but that shows excellent results.
