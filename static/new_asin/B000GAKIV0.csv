8129741,3,B000GAKIV0,"The lack of artwork for this fine movie is easy to understand when you realize that a movie with the listed cast just doesn't exist. There are, in fact, 2 movies. Both have the same title. ""Cielito Lindo"", 1936, with Sr. de Cordova starring, and the 1957 movie stars Sr. Aguilar. My family enjoys watching both of them. Blockbuster must get their information from Amazon as they have the same error in their on-line catalog. I hope someone can straighten this mess out. They are both very fine movies and shouldn't be stuck in Limbo like this.",1207353600,4,543,4.608247422680412
