8087692,4,B000BK5V44,"Although totally focussed on the traditional and rather formal wedding in which all guests are neatly seated theatre style necessitating some license if you are planning to hold your wedding in a non-traditional site, the multiple options for entrances/processional are easy to understand, and demonstrated well. No alternatives are explored for the recessional or for positioning of the bridal party during the ceremony.

Highly recommended as a useful tool for couples stuck with an officiant who does not offer a rehearsal, or for officiants looking to improve their own practice.",1146873600,,583,5.477777777777778
