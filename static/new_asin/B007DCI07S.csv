8514941,4,B007DCI07S,"After watching this production I have to conclude that despite the criticisms about the instrumental flourishes, the Harnoncourt / Ponnelle production continues to be the standard by which all other Poppea productions have to be judged by. Persson delivers an outstanding Poppea, but the minor roles were not up to par. For instance, Klaus Brettschneider's  interpretation of Amore has yet to be matched. The  Bicket / Alden production suffers a little too much from the sins of ""Regietheater"", but it does deliver some memorable images; like the recurring theme of the revolving door and Father Time on platform shoes. In the end, as it should, it's all about the music, and the genius of Monteverdi is allowed to shine through.",1398470400,2,729,5.066666666666666
8514942,5,B007DCI07S,"This lively and inventive production by David Alden grabs the attention from the opening moments and never lets go until the final curtain. The staging is mostly minimalist, the costumes are frequently bizarre and the use of lighting is dramatically incisive. The singers are universally superb, the acting is inspirational and the orchestral contribution under the leadership of Harry Bicket is faultless. Need more be said? Well yes .....

The story is, of course, essentially about extreme characters doing extreme things and this element is allowed full rein. The use of minimalist props and scenery throws the dramatic weight onto the singers/actors. The main prop could be described as the lighting which is constantly used to great effect to highlight the characters as appropriate and to segment the stage/scenery in order for the action to have greatest impact.

The use of extreme costuming is entirely appropriate within this concept with the celestial bodies being the most bizarre. The supporting roles such as the double casting of Arnalta and Ottavia's nurse, both wonderfully portrayed with great humour by Dominique Visse, are also strikingly colourful. The least unusual costumes are worn by the leading roles of Nero, Poppea, Seneca, Ottavia and Ottone which strangely gives them the outward appearance of greater normality and thus strengthens their dramatic viability. The minor supporting roles are all imaginatively attired to underline their individual roles within the drama.

There is a great deal of humour in this production which balances the main grim narrative. Changes of pace are frequent and are often considerable which underlines the dangerously unstable situation being enacted. All of this is in the music but a particularly effective use of these wildly varying fluctuations is experienced here giving enormous vitality throughout what is a very long opera.

All the singing and acting is superb. It seems invidious to single out particular artists but one must do. Sarah Connolly as Nero seems even finer than she was in Handel's Caesar. Miah Persson is ideally cast as Poppea having a wild and sensual streak about her as evident several years ago in Mozart's Cosi. She has taken to this early music genre like a duck to water! Franz-Josef Selig brings impressive weight to the role of Seneca with his deep sonority and impressive stage presence. He had the same effect in the recent Mozart's Osmin and Beethoven's Mass. Both Maite Beaumont and Ruth Rosique as Ottavia and Drusilla are equally fine as indeed is Jordi Domenech as Ottone. As mentioned before, Dominique Visse is wonderfully characterful in his double role of Arnalta and Ottavia's nurse. All the minor parts maintain this level of excellence.

The crisply detailed camera work is well up to the standard we have come to expect from Opus Arte and so is the sound, which is presented in DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo. There is a useful short bonus in the form of a synopsis and there are copious sleeve notes describing the ideas behind the production.

This is a stunningly effective and very modern production that the audience, judging from the sustained and noisy applause at the end, clearly enjoyed with great enthusiasm. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that most, if not all, purchasers will be equally approving provided that they do not instinctively dislike any production that deviates from the accepted traditional view.",1341705600,,3438,5.185585585585586
8514943,4,B007DCI07S,"As if it's not enough to be attributed with inventing opera itself - the first through-composed work being L'Orfeo in 1607 - Monteverdi advanced the artform even further with his last work (attributed), L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643), written at the age of 76 by making it the first opera to deal with a historical subject and real people. The composer takes full advantage of this fact, revelling in the possibilities of extending the qualities associated with the musical-dramatic form to show less elevated and more down-to-earth human behaviour. Directing Monteverdi's final opera for the Liceu in Barcelona in 2009, David Alden emphasises this aspect in his colourful, modernised production which certainly takes liberties with the characters and the setting to draw out the bawdiness and humour that is undoubtedly a part of the work, while Harry Bicket's sensitive conducting of the Liceu's Baroque orchestra finds the delicacy and sensitivity that it also part of the make-up of the human historical figures caught up in the drama of Nero's reign in Rome around AD72.

If that approach at times resembles that of a Carry On film, that's perhaps not as inappropriate as it sounds for this particular work. There is a great deal of sauciness in how Monteverdi and Busenello treat the scandalous behaviour of Nero's infidelities and Poppea's scheming. There is real passion in the seductive lines in which Nero and the music describe the hold that Poppea has over him, and there is some suggestiveness in Nero and Lucan's drunken celebration at having overthrown the stabilising influence of Seneca, but the activities of the Emperor and his affair with Poppea seems to promote a general licentiousness and scheming elsewhere among their associates. Brought together in this way, if Drusilla were to ask Ottone ""Is that an axe in your trousers or are you just pleased to see me?"", or Nero to exclaim, ""Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in f' me!"", it wouldn't be any more out of place than what is actually suggested there in the music and the libretto itself.

There is however much more to L'incoronazione di Poppea than that and the directorial approach is not quite so successful when it comes to approaching the more lyrical qualities of the work. This is best demonstrated by Seneca's death scene, which should be one of the most moving moments in the whole opera, but it fails to strike the right tone here. Musically, it's perfect. Harry Bicket's arrangement and Franz-Josef Selig's bass have the right measure of gravity, nobility and tragedy, but the staging and the curiously dressed pupils of the philosopher work against the deeper implications that this event is to have on the subsequent course of events. Much of the balance in the production is left then to Bicket and the Baroque orchestra of the Liceu to pick up and, indeed, they do so brilliantly. It's a sparser arrangement that doesn't have the same rhythmic verve as the 1993 Ren Jacobs recording (on Arthaus DVD) that I am familiar with, but every note of the sparingly used chitarrone and harpsichord continuo is beautifully weighed and balanced, all the more to highlight the flute, harp and other affetto instrumentation that gives colour to the characters and emotions through their arias.

Attractively designed with plenty of variety in the arrangements, the stage is beautifully lit and coloured, witty, ironic and referential without being overly-clever, keeping the spirit of that aspect of the work intact. If it doesn't cover the full dynamic of the work, the emotion and verve of the singing and acting performances make up for it to a large degree. Miah Persson is terrific as Poppea - much more animated and lyrical here than in anything else I've heard her sing (Britten and Stravinsky) - and Sarah Connolly is a fine impassioned Nero, not essentially evil, but in thrall to his passions and power. Jordi Domench is a little light as the countertenor Ottone, but the variety of his tone balances the other singers well. Maite Beaumont is outstanding as Ottavia and Franz-Josef Selig, as mentioned earlier, suitably dignified as Seneca. The real highlight of this production however is Dominique Visse, who is also the Nutrice in the above mentioned Ren Jacobs version, but here he takes on the contralto roles of the Nurse and Arnalta, fully entering into the spirit of Alden's production. It's the variety of singing parts that is one of the great qualities of L'incoronazione di Poppea and the casting here is superbly balanced in this respect.

Just as important, in this context, is the quality of the recording, and this release is absolutely stunning to look at and listen to in High Definition. There is a beautiful clarity to the singing and the instrumentation with a wonderful sense of ambience. This is sheer perfection as far as technical specifications go and, as far as this production is concerned, it brings out all the qualities of an extraordinary work of early opera. Extras on the DVD and Blu-ray consist only of a Cast Gallery and a narrated Synopsis, while an essay in the booklet takes a closer look at aspects of David Alden's production. The subtitles are in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Catalan.",1336521600,24,5236,4.9874141876430205
