8414771,5,B0043EFAPY,"This is the same great DVD from MathTutorDVD(dot)com.  However, it is much cheaper here and the cover to the disc and DVD are different but the same exact content is on this DVD.  With that said, so happy to have found this at such a great price with learning content that keeps my 19 month old son engaged  with number recognition from one-ten.  Only drawback is that it does not go up to twenty but that's hard to find anyhow in most tot books/DVDs/flashcards.  Overall, great quality with a child boy as the narrator.  It goes over counting really well with each number individually and with different objects, animals, etc.",1354147200,,627,4.654545454545454
