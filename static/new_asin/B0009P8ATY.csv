2308300,5,B0009P8ATY,I think this is an excellent compliment to a fitness program.  I especially like the mix and match where you can select which body part you want to work.  It allows you to jump on for about 15-20 minutes if that is all you have and get in a workout.,1162598400,3,249,3.96
2308301,5,B0009P8ATY,If you want to get into shape and haven't tried weights before I recommend this workout.  You will get the results promised and be on the road to the best physical shape you've been in.  Very well cued instruction and a great overall workout,1155081600,3,241,4.454545454545454
2308302,5,B0009P8ATY,"I loved this DVD!  I've been doing cardio for years and my weight hasn't budged.  As soon as I started Ripped I knew it was the workout for me!  I felt so sore after the first time but did it again a few days later and felt sore but fantastic.  It works all my muscles.

After doing it regularly for about 3 months (in addition to my usual cardio) I've lost 15 pounds and I feel toned!  I thought that in my 30's I'd have to just live with less muscle tone but not anymore.

Jari is a calm easy-to-listen-to instructor and the exercises are easy to follow.  The workout covers all the muscles of the body.  Its a pretty no-nonsense workout and is very sensible.",1150502400,17,661,4.182539682539683
2308303,5,B0009P8ATY,"I'm fast becoming a fan of this powerhouse.  She is tough and does not muck around but motivating and yet somehow fun.

This is a tough and no-nonsense body sculpting workout.  She uses long sets of high repetitions so you will get a lot of definition in your arms and legs.  It's like being at a gym, only you are at home, but you are getting a very similar workout.  There is fantastic music on this dvd and it's not just sitting around in the background, but it's moving you right along with the workout itself.

You use different tempos with the repititions and this makes it more effective and keeps you interested and you also add slight modification changes.  She focuses on breathing properly and using good form and the right weights for the different parts of your body (heavier weights for biceps but lighter for shoulders).

You don't need much in the way of equipment; weights, a step bench and only if you want - a stability ball.  I really love doing this workout because you can feel the benefits right away and you know your arms will thank you later.  This is really great and because you can modify the moves and use different weights in your weights, anyone can benefit from and do this workout.",1150243200,4,1215,4.506849315068493
2308304,4,B0009P8ATY,"I enjoy Jari Love's ""Get Ripped"" workout a lot. It is a high-repetition, strength training workout. This means you do the same muscle-building exercise for each muscle group many times over and over. It isn't as repetitive as you might think, however, because Jari varies the speed at which you do the moves. I found that this 55 minute workout flew by and left me pleasantly worked out at the end. Jari uses a light barbell and a club-sized step (as a weight bench). One background exerciser uses dumbbells instead of a barbell. If you don't own a step, you can simply do those moves on the floor.

As far as difficulty, I would rate this as an intermediate level. Jari's background exercisers, however, show both beginner and advanced modifications which make it possible for everyone to get a great workout. There is a segment separate from the workout itself that goes over modifications in detail, which is perfect for the beginning exerciser.

A couple of minor details: people who do not enjoy ""techno"" types of music may be annoyed by the soundtrack. It is definitely different than most of the other music from workout videos I own. I found it to be unpleasant, but something I could live with. Additionally, although this is a total body workout, I thought the section for abdominals was unimpressive. I hate doing ab work and in fact my abs probably are my weakest muscles.  Even wimpy ol' me found this section to be too easy even with modification.  You may want to add additional abdominal exercises on to your workout.

Overall, this is a great workout that is different from some you may have tried.",1146096000,24,1615,4.712765957446808
2308305,4,B0009P8ATY,This is a great strength training dvd.  has different people doing different levels.  Explains everything and is not annoying like some instructors can be.  I recommend it for someone that needs a video while working out with weights.,1140480000,2,234,5.105263157894737
2308306,4,B0009P8ATY,"This is the only video that I have by Jari Love, but it's a great one.  Ripped is an hi-rep lighter weight endurance workout that runs just under and hour.  It is quite similar to the Bodypump workout or classes, which I personally have never seen but have heard they are alike.  Jari is exercising along with 3 other exercisers which she refers to as the ""Rippers"".  You will need weights, dumbells and/or barbell, a step or a bench you will need for some of the seated exercises (they use the bench for the lying exercises but I just lie on the floor), a mat if you don't have carpet and Jari also recommends a heart rate monitor.  The setting is a bit dark and somewhat plain but didn't bother me.  The music is decent, techno would be the best way to describe it.

The warmup I found a little odd, not really your typical warm up, you just grab some weights and go from the start. You do some shoulder rolls while holding a barbell or weights, and then you will so some deadlifts, rows, deadrows, bicep curls, overhead presses and squats.  These are all moves you will see in the workout but the weight should be much lighter than what you would normally use.

Then it's on to the workout, Jari tells you what exercise is coming so you can prepare.  They also display each exercisers ""personal weight load"" which I really liked, it gives you an idea of what weights to use which I found very helpful.  You start out with squats, a pretty long set with varied counts, 4-4, 3-1. 2-2 and single count.  After these you will do a brief set of plie squats before finishing out with another brief set of traditional squats.  Chest work is next you will do a short set of pushups, followed by bench presses again with varied counts.  Next are pullovers where just one dumbell is used, I usually think these are pretty easy especially in a workout like this where lighter weight is encouraged.  My arms were on fire!  Pullovers also target the triceps and that is where I really felt this one.  Following pullovers is lying triceps extensions to fry the triceps a little more, then you will move into a close grip bench presses that also work the triceps.  Towards the end of this set Jari will combine the two exercises.

Floor leg work is next, inner thighs are worked first with leg lifts, then you will work the outer thighs with more leg lifts, then knee ins with some pulses.  Ankle weights can be used here or a dumbell for a little extra challenge.  Then you will move onto deadlifts and rows.  You will start with deadlifts, then rows, then you will combine the two for a deadrow where you will bend at the hips then row.  Next are lunges, where you will step back and then lunge down and return to standing.  I modified this one just a bit by doing a static lunge in a 2-2 count which I liked better and I will still on pace with Jari and friends.

You will finish out with biceps, shoulders and abs.  The biceps and shoulders are two of the toughest sets in the workout.  The biceps are done in varied counts and is a pretty long set.  The shoulders consist of 4 sets total, you will do 2 sets of side lateral raises, then 2 sets of front raises.  The ab work is pretty easy and short, you will do 3 exercises, reverse crunches, traditional crunches and oblique twists.  Then it's on to the cooldown and stretch.  There is also stretching in between most of the exercises so the final stretch isn't too long.

Overall I really liked this workout and give it 4 and a half stars.  Jari is a very pleasant instructor and I liked her style, I would definitely buy more workouts from her.  The DVD has a few extras, a testimonials section where people talk about why the love the Ripped program, and a techniques and modification section where Krista (one of the Rippers) shows how you can personalize the workout to your needs.  I would rate this workout as intermediate, but it is suitable for all levels.  I would advise viewing the video before doing so you can familiarize yourself with the different rep counts and tempos as most of the exercises have them.  For those who like hi-rep endurance workouts, this one is a great choice.  Well done Jari!",1134864000,112,4157,4.413929040735874

I switch tapes every week (3 times a week with a yoga or stretching video in between).  I've had to break off now and then due to health reasons but find it easy to get back in rhythm by using lighter weights.  Jari Love is encouraging and good at providing positioning tips.,1461715200,,375,4.166666666666667

Resistent metabolisms will suddenly give- trust me on this. The scale want moving though I was starting myself and doing tons of cardio. Doing weights 2~3 times weekly brought me down.

I write full-time. Doing Jari's Core Workout allows me too sit as long as I need to. No pain. No fatigue. Fit back",1461024000,,519,4.068627450980392

2308334,4,B0009P8ATY,A very good high intermediate workout that uses weights and keep your heart rate elevated. However the breaks are too long between the exercises. This is the reason behind the 4 stars and not 5.,1456963200,,194,4.571428571428571
2308335,4,B0009P8ATY,"This dvd is similar to Body Pump classes, though I don't think it was as difficult. Modifications are provided for dumbbells instead of barbells, plain floor or fitness ball instead of riser, etc. I am 50ish and not very fit, but I was able to make it through the dvd using very light weights or body weight modifications. I liked the fact that it includes a set for thigh/hip abductors/adductors. I wish there was a way to turn off the music and just hear the cues (so I could listen to my own music). Some of the fitness models on this dvd are extremely ripped, to a point that no one could get to just with this dvd, but you sure get to see which muscles you are supposed to be working, haha.",1453420800,,695,4.2330827067669174

2308367,5,B0009P8ATY,"I have used many, many workout videos. Jari Love is my favorite by far. The first time I did one of her videos, Get Ripped 1000,"" I considered myself advanced; I was in great shape. The workout blew me away. It was so far beyond the typical workout DVDs available in local stores. We refer to that as my ""Up,Up, Down, Down workout,"" and it's sure to get you soaked with sweat. This workout is equally as good, with less focus on cardio even though it did get my heart rate up. I'm not a fan of cardio anyway. It's a challenging strength training workout with low weights and high reps. (Jari constantly reassures viewers that they will not build bulk with this workout, even though most women would not build bulk anyway unless they were taking some serious supplements).
I recently started using Jari's workouts again, having gotten pretty out of shape after having a baby. I've found that I have no problem completing the entire workout, although I can't use as much weight as I used to. I would recommend this video to an exerciser of any level because weight and modifications can be made to adjust to your level.",1381190400,7,1117,4.534653465346534

2308370,5,B0009P8ATY,"I absolutely love this DVD!!  To make a long story short...I was a member of 24 hour fitness a few years ago and thats where I took my first body pump class.  I loved body pump so much that I travelled all over the metroplex so that I could take Body Pump on Mon Wed and Friday's. Although I loved BP class it was a little stressfull because you had to get there waaaay before class to get a spot so that you could actually see the instructor perform the moves, you had to set up your station etc.  Anyhoo, I am no longer a member of 24 and I really missed the weight training from BP so I started looking around and I found that Les Mills was now selling a Body Pump program for regular consumers for almost $200 (ouchie). In all fairness it came with the several dvd's, the barbells and something else.  However, that was a little steep for my blood and then I found this dvd and the price was right so I decided to give it a shot.

Some reviews were saying that Jari was annoying etc so I was all set to turn my jams up and mute her but she actually gives good cues and explains things well so that I feel like I'm performing the moves well.  Maybe once I'm really comfy with the moves I'll mute her and turn on my homemade body pump play list but either way I'm loving this DVD!!",1369872000,3,1283,4.051383399209486

I didn't like the music at first, but now it doesn't bother me.  This video has a lot of the same moves as body pump, but adds inner and outer thigh exercises, lat work and a quick series of backstepping lunges.  The lunges are nice and easy on the knees.  There's a about 10 quick push-ups done on a two and three count.  I had quit doing push-ups, but I like these and I automatically concentrate on my form.  The shoulder work or front arm raises are amazing.  I use 3 pound weights, and I can only do one arm at a time, but I feel the burn which each lift.  The only exercise missing is the clean and press.  There's also a section on techniqes and modifications.  A physiotherpist has a person demonstrate the exercises.  The physiotherpist positions the exerciser's arms, back or etc to ensure the execise is done correctly, she also shows great options.  This is a 55 minute workout, but the time goes by very quickly and I normally can't do anything else afterwards.  This is a good complete workout.",1365897600,2,1153,4.3023255813953485

I am in my 40's and used the Biggest loser tapes to begin and Jari Love once I had some tone to get the rest of the weight off.  Jari helped me lose 20 pounds.  Jari is right weight loss requires eating healthy foods and it's 85% of the process.  Exercize is key to tone and fitness but what you put into your mouth is the biggest factor.  Jari's tapes have three different levels with someone doing them with you.  If you want to drop back or move on, it's always an option.  I highly recommend her tapes for winter January workouts in the privacy of your own home with shower just steps away.  Do the cool down stretches, it's important!  If you workout and don't cool down with stretches, you'll be too sore to move in days and then you'll quit.  Buy the green Jari Love CD Get Ripped Slim and Lean and a set of 3, 5 and 8 pound hand weights and one yoga mat.  You'll have all you need to be a success.  start with no weights for 1 week, then the 3's then the 5's, and eventually the 8's.  I bought 10's but hardly use them.  The 5's and 8's are the best.

She explains the workouts well.  It's a great upper and lower body workout that will push your limits even if you regularly workout with weights, which I do.  I agree with some of the reviews regarding the warm up/abs/cool down portions as they are all fairly short and basic.  I would have given a 5 star review had those areas been better.  All in all it's a great workout and I'm on my way to purchase more of Jari's DVD's!",1294185600,,604,4.339285714285714
2308408,5,B0009P8ATY,I tried this dvd for my body sculpting days and was amazed by how quickly I could see the defined muscle results. I recommend this dvd as a good one to start out with and to include in your rotations added with cardio workouts of 30 minutes.,1288742400,,241,4.148936170212766
2308409,3,B0009P8ATY,"I'm a certified personal trainer and I like working with various fitness dvds because it's interesting to see how various folks put together their programs.

This dvd has some good overall exercise selection (though I have reservations about some), decent form pointers but I do have issues regarding safety concerns.

The lack of a more thorough warm-up concerns me. I don't feel there's enough there to properly prepare one for the coming workout. I did a bunch of warm-ups on my own.

Repetition tempo: I like the ""idea"" of the variety of tempos within the exercises but felt her ""singles"" are too fast for eccentric loading with these types of exercises and could put a lot of people in unnecessary danger, especially for the deadlifts, pullovers and ""biceps"" curls (which obviously work all the elbow flexors not just the biceps).

 Here's just a few observations regarding certain parts of the dvd.

Dead lift/Bent over rows: Dead lifts are a great full body exercise but Bent over rows, even though very common, aren't a good risk versus reward choice. One arm rows are much safer while still being very beneficial.

Again, the fast single count eccentrics make both the Deadlifts and Bent over rows very high risk and definitely not worth the reward.

Skull crusher/Triceps press combo: Interesting combination to use with Dumbbells. I think that doing the close grip triceps press with a barbell can put unnecessary pressure/stress on the wrists (I did all the exercise w/ DBs).

Seated Lateral Raises: These tend to be safer shoulder exercises than overhead presses for many people so I like her choice of exercise, still I think doing them from a standing position (especially a split stance) is better because you integrate your body more and the feet are a better base of support than the glutes. I think seated positions can put unnecessary stress on the spine.

Abdominals Section:I tend not to be a fan of crunches or oblique crunches because most people don't need extra spinal flexion as it puts unnecessary stress against the intervertebral discs. However if someone is going to do crunches I think they are much safer performed at slow tempos with a sustained contraction and using less reps. On Ripped they are performed at a fairly rapid tempo which can lead to poor form and the use of momentum. I feel that planks, side planks and rollouts are better for training the core's true function with less chance of injury to the spine.",1261958400,25,2453,4.875
2308410,5,B0009P8ATY,"I wanted to find a DVD that would give me a good workout without having too many different pieces of equipment - all I use for this workout is a set of dumbbells. I have this and ""Get Ripped to the Core"" and I really enjoy the workouts. Jari's voice is soothing, which I like, and she is very supportive while she talks you through the workout. The people in the workout are all doing the exercises at different ability levels and you are told to modify the workout to your own abilities and comfort level. I especially like that she counts the reps out loud so you don't have to look at the TV to make sure you're keeping up! I used Cathe something-or-other's video and hated it and sold it. I'm keeping these!
Update 5/13/12: I have 5 of Jari Love's DVDs and, while my favorite is ""Ripped and Chiseled"", I still like this one as my second favorite.  I find I use this DVD, ""Get Ripped"", when I feel like just a light workout or if I haven't done any weight training for a while and need to ease back into it.  I highly recommend it for a beginner, and I also recommend ""Get Ripped and Chiseled"" for a more challenging workout.  BTW I also just did a Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred for the first time and I really liked it, too - hard to believe I can feel so drained after a 20 minute workout!",1258761600,,1294,4.168
2308411,4,B0009P8ATY,"I thought this DVD was going to kick my rear in the literal sense. Unfortunately it was more intermediate than I expected. I am a Firm junkie and do a lot of Cathe as well. I consider myself on the low end of advanced.

This is a nice workout and I will do it again. But it will enter my rotation as the workout I do when I am sore or tired from my more advanced tapes. It is NOT a cardio workout. It is all about sculpting, which is fine, just not what I really expected. There are also Cathe DVDs that are far more advanced for sculpting and weight work.

The workout did go by fast and she is excellent when it comes to demonstrating good form. She was not irritating and her background folks demonstrate lots of different modifications. You do need some equipment, but there are multiple ways to use what you have to make the most of the workout. If you do it just the way she suggests you need a barbell w/ about 20 pounds of weight, 5 and 10 lb hand weights and a step or bench to use for exercises where you are on your back. You can do the workout without the barbell, but you must have hand weights.

UPDATE:
My Cathe kick wound up leaving me injured. I was under strict instructions to stop ""leaping and jumping"" (LOL). I never expected it, but this is the workout I come back to. It is low impact on your knees and feet but it is still fairly intense. It has been 2 years now and I still use it.",1258588800,,1406,4.068592057761733

2308413,4,B0009P8ATY,"I just used this video a couple days ago and it was not what I was expecting--but I still feel it.  That, I consider to be a very good thing.  Jari Love is much more into dumbells and barbells than I am used to and I was hoping for more cardio.  However, I actually think I like her workout as it is because there are a ton of cardio DVDs by other people and this is the first good weight training video I've seen, so it makes a good addition to my collection.  Plus, the nature of weights means you can scale the difficulty of this up or down depending on what you want by changing your weights.  For certain, if you use the right weights and try hard through this video, you will feel it the next day.  The video quality itself (meaning the colors and picture quality) is lower than I expected but it is an older video so that's to be expected.  And it doesn't interfere with the workout at all, jsut something that caught my attention.  Jari is a good motivator and explains things well.  She also has people behind her at different fitness levels doing just about every modifcation you might want to know so anyone can perform the movements.

I don't like to exercise, but I have to admit that this is the first exercise DVD that I don't dread doing. The warm up is short and then you get right into it. The time flies by pretty quickly with this one. You can work with light weights or heavy weights, depending on your fitness level. On some of the exercises, I've had to drop the amount of weight because of the high number of reps she does. The shoulders section is a killer for me. I really feel like I've gotten an excellent workout when I'm done with this one. She encourages you, but  without all the fake cheerful banter. That's exactly why I like her--she gets to work and doesn't waste time. I've purchased two more of Jari's DVDs and can't wait to try them as well.

An hour is over before you know it, and if you use an adequate weight for your fitness level, you REALLY feel like you hit the muscle groups that were worked. I feel just as sore after Jari's videos as I did after a workout with my personal trainer, only working out with Jari is much less expensive!",1219104000,,565,4.008849557522124

The exercises itself might indeed work great and get you 'ripped' over time, but I find myself rather watching 'normal' tv 1 hour while lifting weights than popping in this DVD. To me, working out must be fun and I clearly don't enjoy this one! (Actually none of her workouts work for me, personally. I rather stick to the FIRM and Tae Bo!)",1210809600,2,506,4.451612903225806
2308432,4,B0009P8ATY,"This is the 'easiest' of Jari's workouts. There are less reps and sets than in her other videos which makes this a good beginner to intermediate workout because it's so doable and like another reviewer said, no dread factor. So, knowing that, enables me to pick up heavier weights than I otherwise would with here other workouts. I agree that in general the ab exercises are not that tough and should be longer. So, I always add wrist and ankle weights (which makes quite a difference) and sometimes just repeat the ab section. The only thing I miss are the chapters that her other workouts provide where you can easily pick the exercises you want to do or skip over.

2308433,3,B0009P8ATY,"I have been a fan of Body Pump for a few years now.  I had bought a weighted bar set and a VHS years ago from Costco.  I also had a roommate who was an instructor so I had access to her instructional tapes that I could do at home.  These were video taped classes in a gym starring the Body Pump creator.

I was so excited when I read about Jari Love in a recent magazine reviewing workout DVDs.  Her newest DVD ""Get Ripped and Chiseled"" came highly rated.  I also read numerous glowing reviews of all of her DVDs on Amazon and Collagevideo.com.  I bought all 5 of her workouts with high expectations.

I just finished ""Get Ripped"" and I am so disappointed.  It was not high rep and I did not find it difficult.  I had to raise my normal Body Pump weight and I still barley broke a sweat.  And to top it off it was kind of boring.  The music was monotonous and I wasn't very motivated.  The squat and lunge portion was way to short.  My shoulders were the only part of my body that felt worked after this gigantic waste of an hour workout. I like to feel like I can't squeeze another rep out by the end of a set.

I am only able to workout while my toddler is sleeping so I want a lot of bang for my hour workout.  This did not fit the bill.  I hope her other workouts will be more challenging.

In this workout, one body part is worked at a time. While Jari Love alternates the tempo of the move you're making i.e. a bicep curl on a two up, two down count, then a three up, one down, then a four up, four down count -- I never felt like I couldn't keep up.

Esp. helpful is the separate section of the dvd where you can see how to modify every single exercise for your fitness level.

And there is a leg section where you do lying leg lifts. I add a resistence band and a weight to give it a little kick. I wish the abs section was longer but I tend to overdo the abs anyways and most of the exercises in this dvd do work your core. I could replay the abs section but I never do. This dvd is through and effective. I also like the fact the exercises are shown by four diffrent people and modifcations are shown if needed. Another perk is the weight loads being used by the people exercising are shown onscreen to help keep you from overtraining. I highly reccomend this and any Jeri love dvd.,1199750400,,785,4.24

Jari keeps you moving with very short rest periods between sets.  I did the entire workout with two sets of dumbbells - 3 lbs and 10 lbs.  There are three other people in the video and they do a good job of showing variations on the exercises.

The video hits all the major muscle groups in about 45 minutes (55 minutes including warm-up and cool down).  My heart rate stayed pretty steady for the entire workout and I burned about 250 calories while working up a good sweat.  Jari recommends using this vid 3 times a week to build muscle and burn fat.

2308456,5,B0009P8ATY,"I'm an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser.  While I can certainly do many advanced workouts, they often leave me feeling exhausted and have a huge dread factor.  Although I want my workouts to challenge me, I also want to feel GOOD after exercising, not wiped out.  Given this, Jari Love's Get Ripped is a perfect match for me.  I definitely feel thoroughly worked out after using this DVD, but the constant tempo changes and variety of equipment used keep it interesting, meaning that the 55 minutes fly by and there is absolutely NO dread factor--in fact, I look forward to doing this workout!

It did take me a little while to get used to Jari's style, however.  First of all, the ""warm-up"" is not at all like traditional warm-ups in other workouts:  instead of doing some light aerobics and stretching, Jari has you start right in with the weight training, not doing a lot of reps but enough to warm up the hamstrings, biceps, and shoulders.  After some trial and error, I found that I could do this segment using 10# dumbbells.  In fact, I used my 10# dumbbells through the majority of the workout, going a little heavier for the first set of chest work and deadlifts but dropping down a little towards the end of the workout for the biceps and shoulders work.  The great thing about all of the Ripped workouts is that Jari and her three background exercisers vary not only in the equipment they use--eg, Jari usually uses a barbell, while another exerciser sticks with dumbbells and others sometimes use just weight plates--but also in their individual weight loads, which are very helpfully shown on screen at the start of every new exercise.

For all of the exercises, Jari varies the count.  She generally starts with a slow four up-four down count, moves into three up-one down, goes to two-and-two, sometimes to singles, and then pyramids back up again.  Given this, you will be doing A LOT of reps, but you are never rushed, which allows you to lift heavier if you prefer.  You can also always drop down to lighter weights for the quicker sets, although Jari does move from tempo to tempo with no breaks (there are short stretch breaks between body parts, however).  The workout begins with squats/plie squats, then moves to floor for chest, starting with push-ups (only one set, thank goodness!).  Still on your back, you'll do pullovers and then a tricep superset--I found this particularly tough, as my triceps were pre-fatigued from the chest/back work.  I liked that Jari then stays on the floor for inner and outer thigh work in the form of side leg lifts; she does enough reps so that you feel the burn and then that's it, you're done!  Coming back to a standing position, you'll do deadlifts and then a deadlift/row combo.  This is followed by just a single set of four-count lunges on each leg (I was VERY happy not to have to do various tempo counts here).  Then comes biceps, shoulder work in a seated position (Jari and crew use their steps, but a chair works fine too), and finally abdominals.  The abs work consists of just a few different exercises (working lower abs, upper abs, obliques), but when I make sure to execute them with good form, I really feel the burn here.  One background exerciser does the abs work (and some of the previous exercises as well) using a stability ball.  The workout ends with some nice stretches on the floor, mainly for your hips and hamstrings.

Extras on this DVD include demonstrations of the exercises, information on the science behind Ripped, and testimonials.  The one thing I wasn't so crazy about with this workout was the music--it generally had a pumping, techno-type beat (with occasional vocals) similar to what you would hear in a club.  This is not my style, but once I get into the workout, I barely notice it.  Jari herself comes across as a bit cool and reserved, and although some people might not click with her, I actually liked her no-nonsense style as well as her excellent form pointers and good cuing.  She does try to be encouraging, frequently saying things like ""awesome!"" and ""you can do it!""  Although I think that this workout is perfect for intermediates like myself, it's actually appropriate for a wide range of exercisers:  advanced exercises should have no problems modifying up, and I think even true beginners could do this workout so long as they paid attention to form (watching the exercise breakdowns first would be a great idea) AND made sure to keep the weights VERY light, or even no weight (Jari and one of the background exercisers use body weight only for the lunge series).  Overall, I'm thrilled to have discovered the Ripped series and believe this workout to be an extremely valuable addition to my collection; highly recommended!",1181692800,5,4743,4.754578754578755

Jari is good at cue giving and transitions you well throughout the workout.  My only criticism (and I gave 5 stars, so it's not much) is that the ab work at the end doesn't challenge me enough. Several other reviews have mentioned this as well. But I have a separate ab workout anyway...plus, I am so tired by the end that I'm not much up for abs at that point.

I love that she is not perky and fake-sweet. I like that she is enthusiastic about her workout, but not jumping around like she's hyped up on speed like some others do. I love that she does all the workouts, some instructors walk around. I love how she tells you what exercise is coming up next while stretching the one you just worked. It gives you time to get ready for each move. It is easy to modify with hand weights, as opposed to a barbell. She gives a very short, but very uplifting speech at the end, during the final stretch that left me very motivated. The workout goes really quick and there are no parts that I ""dread"" like some other workout DVD's that I have. After doing this workout I felt like a warrior princess or something, very strong. I can actually see myself getting a better physique through this DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because during the deadlift-row combo, they do not show the 1 person using hand weights instead of a barbell, so I could not watch her to make sure I was modifying it the same as her--did she go to the bathroom during this segment?

There is always room for taking it up a level and changing things up during the video. Jari does very high reps with lower weights which is something I would not do at the gym on my own. I have already noticed changes in my body and I have been doing the workouts for about a month. This is a more advanced workout so if you are new to lifting and toning pace yourself. Start with low or no weights and make sure you have good form. If you are advanced then you will have a blast! Something about the workout style calms me, but energizes me at the same time. It's great!",1172448000,2,666,4.053030303030303
2308506,5,B0009P8ATY,"I started out doing the Crunch DVDs, but really wanted to take it to a higher level.  I found this DVD and do it three days a week.  I pair it with Crunch Boot Camp to get some cardio in.

This DVD is the best.  My body fat percentage is down, I can really see definition in my shoulders, chest and arms (my legs are already in really great shape).  I wanted to get the arms Annette Benning had in American President, and I can really see myself headed in that direction. Yay!

It's about 55 minutes long, and it really flies by.  The instructor is matter of fact and to the point.  She's helpful in that she tells you exactly where you should be focusing for each particular exercise, her instruction is really top-notch, and the people exercising with her are not annoying at all (unfortunately can't say that about the people on the Boot Camp DVD).

To be more specific, I typically burn about 235 calories during this workout, and 55% body fat.  Of course, there is also the afterburn to consider, but during the workout itself, this is what I burn.

My only complaint is that when the DVD tells you the weight load the other exercisers are carrying, it doesn't say until you're already starting the exercises.  One of the girls is about my build, and I'd like to know what she's carrying before I start so I know which weight to pick up. Oh well, I'll be able to just remember it before too long.

Also, during some of the work, they don't show the girl using the dumbbells enough.  In one exercise, they don't show her at all.  I'm not about to stick a bunch of bar bells in my living room, so I need to see what dumbbell girl is doing!

Other than that minor thing, this is an excellent DVD, and I look forward to moving on to her others.",1171843200,6,1745,4.274390243902439
2308507,2,B0009P8ATY,"I was disappointed with this DVD considering the title and how good Jeri Love looks.  It would be  good for beginners to weightlifting, but as an experienced weightlifter who is trying to build an at home routine, the DVD is really easy.  Just to give an example, I think the routine includes maybe 8 push ups and 12 lunges on each leg. The DVD is well intentioned, but Jeri Love lacks enthusiasm, giving a few weird winks and smiles once in awhile.  Oh, and even as a fan of techno music, the background beats in this video are really dull, bordering on annoying.",1170115200,5,564,4.446601941747573
2308508,5,B0009P8ATY,"Jari Love's Get Ripped program is Awesome. This is the first DVD, ""Get Ripped! with Jari Love."" The workout is challenging for newcomers to weights or to those returning after a hiatus, or the experienced.  You get results. Jari is motivating in a great way.  You can tell she walks the talk and believes in what she is doing.
I especially loved this video because I don't feel burnt out after doing it but I feel the burn.  I also love the energy and atmosphere of the video.
There are three other participants in the workout.  It shows the lbs of the weights each participant is using.  I though that was great because then you know what to strive for or you know that if she/he is using that weight I definitely need to start lower or the same etc.  It also shows the participants at different angles so you can see the their forms better.
There is a piece in the DVD that shows modifications as well as modifications being shown during the exercise.  The modifications are clear and effective.
Jari gives great directions and information about the exercises.  She makes you think about your form and breathing which is really important.  I've done many videos where breathing and form are hardly mentioned.  I absolutely enjoy this workout!
There is a piece on why these exercises are effective.  This is great information because it's good to know why the exercise is effective and how it's making your body to burn calories and fat.  This knowledge helps to push your self.
There is a piece on Nutrition.  Nutrition is just as important as exercise.  Many times people forget about the nutrition and only do the exercise so this piece is a great reminder to some and a new lesson to other.",1169164800,2,1695,4.588039867109635
2308509,5,B0009P8ATY,"This is Jari Love's first workout video, which serves as a great introduction to those who are just beginning strength training with weights, and is also a thorough and effective workout for intermediate exercisers. This was actually my first total-body strength training workout video and I used it consistently for about four months before I moved on to the subsequent and more difficult, ""Get Ripped: Slim & Lean."" These exercises are 100% no-nonsense, consisting of high repetitions of classic, tried-and-true exercises like forward and plie squats, lunges, bicep curls, dead-lifts, overhead presses, lying inner & outer leg lifts, minimal abdominal work and so-forth. Jari's queuing and instruction is right on the mark, and she gives clear explanation and attention to form.

I had originally given this DVD 4 stars, since some of the segments are beneath my level now (especially the ab portion) as I've now moved on to the more challenging ""Get Ripped: Slim & Lean,"" which I enjoy even more and use instead of this workout now. However, ""Get Ripped"" is an efficient and complete workout that is more suitable for a beginner-to-intermediate exerciser, so I added another star, since it is challenging without being grueling or too difficult and is a perfect place to start.",1167523200,2,1280,5.153846153846154
2308510,5,B0009P8ATY,"You will still need to do cardio seperately but it's a great way to get in a weight lifting session at home. I really love it. She's great, straight forward, not at all annoying or peppy.  I highly recommend it. I continue to be challenged by the workout. I have been working out at a gym so I thought I could use 8 pound dumbells but she does so many repititions and variations that I ended up going to 5 pounds (3 for triceps) and worked my way back up. The best thing about it is that you can increase the weight to continue to challenge yourself but even with light weights this DVD is challenging, in a good way. I'm really glad I purchased it and will certainly try her other DVDs soon.",1165190400,3,692,4.164179104477612

The whole exercise is to the point with no cheesy choreograph and it is very effective. If you are looking for a serious and effective weight training DVD, you won't be disappointed. It's great for guys as well. My husband tried it with me and he avers that it works. NOTE: The program does not include warm up section, so it would be best to do your own warm up before beginning the DVD. It does include short stretching at the end of each workout section, which is great!",1164412800,2,587,4.297297297297297

It's a great and through workout, and the correct way to do the exercises are carefully explained by Jari,  Based on the amount of weights you choose to use, this workout can be adapted to many fitness levels.

I also do lots of spin exercise on my bike, which helps me recover from all the leg work Jari does. I've always been fairly fit, but after having 2 kids, I got back into the routine of exercising again, and couldn't be happier with Jari's DVD's! I've been doing this DVD 1-2 times a week, with 2-3 times of 30min spinning for a little over a month, and have felt a huge difference!

I am currently not eating any animal products or bi-products (see Forks over Knives - DVD)  I feel fantastic.

8064622,4,B0009P8ATY,"I've had this DVD since it first came out. I got several other Jari Love DVDs after, but this one is my favorite because it's straightforward and pretty quick. I think this is a great DVD for people newer to weight lifting. After about 8 years of not doing anything, I pulled it back out again a few months ago as I'm trying to get back in shape. I like Jari Love's style in leading, and I find it easy to follow and to modify as needed. As a newbie to lifting initially (and recently feeling like a newbie again), I appreciate all her additional instructions and modeling. After doing this several times, however, I really don't want to hear all the talking that wastes time. I wish there was a second track on that DVD that had just the exercises streamlined so there is no wasted time. I don't mind the music, but it is kind of annoying at one point when it seems to change beat. I do like that everything is done in 4-beat sections.",1470528000,,936,4.264044943820225
