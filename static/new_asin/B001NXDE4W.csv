8328071,1,B001NXDE4W,"The show on Oxegen is an hour long.  These stories are only a glad hour, so it's not what I was looking for or thought I purchased",1390348800,,130,3.814814814814815
8328072,5,B001NXDE4W,"I love watching Oxygen but I do not have this station
anymore. A little scary to think anyone can think of
taken another one's life.",1373068800,,132,4.32
8328073,5,B001NXDE4W,I love snapped and these DVD's cover every minute of it.  You can also get later seasons on instant view!!!,1351296000,,107,4.35
8328074,4,B001NXDE4W,"The DVD is exactly what you see on the Oxygen channel.  If you love the show and want to have the commercial free disc at home then you cannot go wrong.  What you will not find is any behind the scenes or additional information on the cases. I would have given a five star, but the lack of additional footage is disappointing.",1246060800,3,326,4.241935483870968
8328075,4,B001NXDE4W,"This is a short review to say that I LOVE the Snapped programs on TV's Oxygen Channel.  So, of course, I was excited to purchase this DVD.  I must say that I am a little disappointed... or rather I have hope that Oxygen will produce a full series of these. This disk has only 5 episodes all of which get repeated and repeated play during the Oxygen regular schedule.  I was hoping for more, but have already seen the 5 on the disk (many times... ) during the repeat TV play.  This is not a comment about the episodes themselves - all of which are GREAT!....Just a suggestion that Oxygen hurry-up and jump on this tide of people (like me) who like to watch TV programming on DVD and will pay to do so.
Oh and BTW - I pre-ordered this from Amazon and have already rec'd it (3/6/09), depsite Amazaon's current listing that it is not yet in stock.",1236297600,10,843,4.25
