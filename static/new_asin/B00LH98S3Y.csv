6487416,4,B00LH98S3Y,"These two Twilight Zone episodes are fine, (although ""Night Of The Meek"" has never been a favorite of mine) but I can't imagine why the very best TZ Christmas episodes isn't included. ""Changing Of The Guard"" is the one with old Professor ""Weird Beard"" Fowler (Donald Pleasance) who is being retired against his will just before Christmas. He's convinced that his life and career have been a failure . . . until he takes a life-changing and heart-warming trip to the Twilight Zone. It's a beautiful performance, and a very touching Christmas story.

There were only three TZ Christmas episodes (and one of them, ""Five Characters In Search Of An Exit,"" barely mentions Christmas, although it is very good.) Why put out a disc with just two of them -- especially when it's missing the best one?",1419292800,17,791,4.773722627737226

Both episodes, The Night of the Meek and Five Characters in Search of an Exit are excellent. I do have to admit that Five Characters is my favorite. A must see!!!",1502582400,2,285,4.39622641509434

8665885,5,B00LH98S3Y,"i remember watching the twilight zone when i was a kid. This was a double feature of this great tv show. The 1st episode is about a man playing santa at the store. He is an alcoholic santa who drinks at the tavern. The kids all get so excited to see santa as all kids do but santa gets fired for being drunk but he finds a magic santa bag and gives the poor people whatever they wish for. He pulls out of the magic bag whatever they want. I love the magic of christmas. The santa is played by art carney. The 2nd episode is about a soldier, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a hobo and a clown who wake up in a strange room with no memory of how they got there. They try to get out. The soldier turned into a little doll at the end and they were all plastic. If you are looking for a family show to remember back in time for christmas then you should buy this for under 10 dollars.",1476403200,,872,3.9322033898305087
