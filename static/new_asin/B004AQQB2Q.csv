8420647,5,B004AQQB2Q,This DVD set provides a very solid understanding on how to use light in video production.  It uses a humorous way to tech you the right ways to control lighting in many different situations.  The included short films and included explanations on how scenes were shot is also very helpful.  I liked this set so much I also purchased their Sound DVD.  I highly recommend this product.,1321056000,,382,4.656716417910448

8420649,5,B004AQQB2Q,"I highly recommend this DVD to anyone seeking to add production value to your projects. These techniques, fully explained and demonstrated, are easy to understand and fun to watch. David and Barry do a great job of making the technical details interesting and fun.

I tested this DVD on a group of aspiring teenaged producers and dp's believing that I'd have to break up the lessons into multiple days. I was wrong. They not only watched the first disc in it's entirety, they watch the second as well, staying past the normally scheduled session to watch and learn. We watched The third DVD the next day (a day not scheduled for classes). As an instructor, I found this instructional set made my job so incredibly easy. I sat back and let David and Barry do the work for me. All I'd did was press play.

The point I'm making is that this set of DVDs is worth every penny and maybe more. I learned many important principles of how to use light to create the look and feel of a scene using basic techniques, the proper lights, and clear and concise technical understanding of the process and science behind it.

I couldn't be happier with this product! Thanks Guys.

8420650,5,B004AQQB2Q,"I started in the film and video production world about 7 years ago.  I now own and operate a successful independent production house in Colorado.  All I can say is that I wish I had access to this video when I got started.  This DVD covers everything that both the aspiring and working professional needs to know about lighting.  The information is well-organized, easy to access and very relevant.  As someone who learned many of these lessons the hard way, I appreciated how Barry and David broke down each section.  I was able to skip around and watch the sections I felt would fill the gaps in my knowledge.  But the great part was when I went back to watch the parts I thought I already knew, there was also stuff to learn there as well.  It covers the basics like color temp, exposure and types of lighting, but it also gives you scene breakdown examples to show you how certain looks were achieved.

While this is not really a DVD about cinematography, you can be confident that it will give you the knowledge you need to apply lighting techniques artistically.

I am confident this DVD would be an asset to anyone who lights or shoots for a living (or would like to).  There's something here for just about everyone in the industry.

When you are ready make lighting decisions out of knowledge and creativity instead of ignorance and necessity, this is the DVD you need.",1299888000,2,1378,4.556910569105691
