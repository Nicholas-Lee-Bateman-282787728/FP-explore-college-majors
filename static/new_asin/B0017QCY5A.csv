I had hoped that there would be a voice over because you have to read the screen and for those who English is not a first language or in some environments where literacy is a challenge the whole concept is lost on having to read it.

This video is just a few minutes and in comparison to other multimedia training a good value but I just wish there was a little more than what I could have ""stolen"" for free.",1363737600,,655,4.190476190476191
