2889831,5,B000SSONES,"A fun movie with the wonderfully funny Mantan Moreland.  Sit back, relax and enjoy comedies when they did not have sex, violence (not really) and something relevant to say.",1464998400,,172,4.931034482758621

2889834,4,B000SSONES,Good movie but not enough Mantan Moreland. Cast was good and funny.,1426636800,,67,4.666666666666667
2889835,5,B000SSONES,"While I have not seen this movie as it was a gift, the person to whom it was given to has not told me one way or the other if she likes it or not.",1404777600,,146,3.2
2889836,2,B000SSONES,"I bought this movie because I wanted to see more of Mantan Moreland.  Police chief Edgar Kennedy played his usual role as the slow burning cop.  Mantan had less time in this show, so the movie was much diminished by his small role.  Cosmo Jones was a pathetic little nerd who was trying to be a detective.  Overall the movie was a disappointment.",1335139200,6,346,4.444444444444445
8206619,3,B000SSONES,"The black sidekick's stereotypical treatment just makes me go ""Aaarrrgh!!!""  Other than that, it's a cute story typical of the period and genre.",1491177600,,144,5.260869565217392

8206624,1,B000SSONES,Boring and cheap production evidenced by bad sets. Poor quality acting.,1475107200,,71,5.545454545454546
8206625,1,B000SSONES,"I was enjoying this movie, but at the 28 minute mark my screen went blank - I fast forwarded it to 30 minute mark and the movie was back on. I watched it on Amazon prime. The low rating is because the film stopped. It's Not for the acting or the story plot.",1474502400,,257,3.8679245283018866
