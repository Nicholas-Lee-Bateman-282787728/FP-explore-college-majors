4216764,5,B003XF1W38,"I don't like picking ""love it"" with such a both painful and deeply disturbing subject matter but this story needs to be told, for those who don't know it and did not know the depth of the abuse and lack of compassion for human life the Japanese soldiers showed and for those who ""were not aware"" of the BIG PICTURE as it relates to World War II.  75,000 American and Filipino soldiers were made to march 65 miles to prison camps only half made it.  This is painful to watch, even the reenactments, unbelievable...how people could treat people in this manner.  I don't agree with the bomb but do people know the truth...the whole story?  I would venture to say most don't and nor do they care, it is like it happened in 1942 so why do I need to know history?  There is more....so much more than the average person knows........I guess there are those who want it that way....hello sheeple!",1420761600,2,888,4.45679012345679

4216766,4,B003XF1W38,"Bataan?  What is that?
Yes, to the young folks out there who only had one history class in high school.  Bataan may never have been mentioned.
This is a must see for those who don't have a clue what Bataan was or is.
We all take our veterans for granted a tad too much.
According to this video 11,000 young Americans were killed or died under the brutal Japanese during World War Two WWII.  Just in the Bataan Death March.  Just in this one segment of WWII.
I also recommend the documentaries about the constructing of the railroad and the bridge on the river Quai.  No, not the Hollywood movie.  That was mostly fiction. One has to view the documentaries to learn of the real story.  I was fortunate enough to travel to the real bridge on the river Quai in Thailand.  It's a steel bridge.  And it was bombed by planes during WWII - not blown up as the Hollywood movie makes it out.
The American POW's constructing the railroad were allowed to keep track of the names of the dead Americans until one day over 250 died in that one day - and the Japanese stopped allowing American POW's to keep track of the names of the dead.
The brutality of the Japanese can never be over stated.
This film - Death March of Bataan -  a docudrama - is a  must see for all young people.",1420070400,4,1268,4.2635983263598325
4216767,5,B003XF1W38,"Watched this on Veterans Day, in memory of my uncles, who as prisoners of the Japanese, were forced to go on this death march.  As hard as it was to watch, I did it, imagining what it must have been like for those actually there, the horrors they had to endure on a daily basis as they watched their comrades being executed or dieing from disentery or starvation.  One reviewer complained that this was a documentary and not a movie.  Think he missed the point.

Today, of all days, I watched and gave thanks to all those who gave their lives in the service of their country, and suffered unspeakable horrors.  I remembered my mother's stories of her beloved older brothers, one of whom died unmarked on some unknown road in the Phillippines and never made it home.  A short film about a tragic time in the history of WW II, it will help me to always remember, and never forget.  Thank you to all Veterans, past and present.",1415664000,3,924,4.431952662721893
4216768,1,B003XF1W38,"It's a narration of what transpired during the march. Cover is giving out a false guide that this is a ""war movie"". Don't buy it.`Waste of money.",1383264000,2,145,4.407407407407407

8408111,1,B003XF1W38,"Noble intentions and fascinating statistics don't say the horrendous production values, sound editing, acting, reenactments, production design, practical effects, etc. etc. A kid in middle school who gets his first camera as a Christmas gift and goes about making a short movie with his friends could do better. Waste of money.",1522540800,,327,5.431372549019608

8408119,1,B003XF1W38,"I wanted a documentary to show to my 7th grade students. This was entirely too graphic to show to anyone. Although I want my students to understand how desperately, horribly difficult the Death March was for our veterans and their Filipino allies, I don't believe anyone needs to see a close-up of maggots worming their way out of a dysentery-covered anus.",1454371200,,356,4.852459016393443
