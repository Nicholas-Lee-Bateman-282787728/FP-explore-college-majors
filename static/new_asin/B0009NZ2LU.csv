2306454,3,B0009NZ2LU,"The movie was not great, but it was okay. I watch many movies with my daughter, and many repeats, but this one will probably not get picked as often. My daughter felt the same way. It's not a bad movie, it just lacks excitement. It could have been written to be really funny, and the writer could have made the characters exciting. It does have a few really funny parts in it. This could have been a great movie.",1142467200,,412,4.227848101265823
2306455,1,B0009NZ2LU,"If I was the cinematographer who worked on this film, I'd be severely depressed.  All of that good work in making a colorful, light, and playful world lost in complete ineptitude from everyone else who worked on this movie.

The story is actually a good one, despite cliches.  A young girl (9 years) named Ociee Nash from Mississippi is turning out to be something of a tomboy, which her father worries about because of her lack of a mother (died from measles).  He sends her to her prim and proper Tennessee aunt, and along the way she has a cheery and profound effect on everyone she meets, including the Wright brothers and the President of the United States, among others.

It's based on a book, and something tells me that book is probably really good.  This movie, however, loses everything that was given to it, literally given to it, by being incredibly flat and mispaced.  The dramatic effect from the shots is completely lost, the acting is terrible (yeah yeah, I know they're kids... they were still terrible), and it's almost insulting to try to watch an hour and a half of their strained, horrible accents.  1898 Ociee Nash sounds like a California Valley Girl, the adult actors literally sound like they refuse to even try, and it looks like the editor took whichever the first shot they finished was and just threw it together, cutting only sufficiently enough to look like it was planned.

Whereas I give this only one star out of five, it earns that one star for its try and its pretty pictures.  It wasn't a total loss, but it was a great one.

2306456,5,B0009NZ2LU,"This film was extremely well done and a real treat for both my wife and I. In the classic Disney style, the lives of 19th century Americans are portrayed in a heart warming way. Ociee is a young girl facing puberty after living her life as a tomboy. Her adventures are very touching - I had to think of a young female Forest Gump. Everyone who sees this film will enjoy it.",1127433600,14,373,4.194444444444445
2306457,5,B0009NZ2LU,"The Adventures of Ociee Nash is a  warm, wonderful movie for family entertainment. Boys and girls will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully directed and produced film. Parents will be glad that there is a child-friendly movie that they can watch with their kids.

Ociee Nash is a precocious child who survives life's most traumatic event with adventure, fun, and optimism.

And don't forget to read the book that this film is based on by Milam Propst: A Flower Blooms on Charlotte Street (and its sequel, Ociee on Her Own).

The McGary Sisters directed and produced their screen adaptation. Their love of this film shows on every frame.

Note: I saw the movie when it was released in select theaters.",1121817600,14,697,4.872881355932203
2306458,3,B0009NZ2LU,"I would suppose a girl from 7-9 years old would consider this a 5 star movie. For the rest of us it is a three at best.

Ociee lives in rural Mississippi with her dad and two brothers. They have very bad Southern country accents and sayings like, ""I am going to tell you children a story on myself."" There is also the over use of the word, ""dang."" Ociee is a 9 year old Tom boy. She meets a gypsy played by a Mexican with what appears to be a French accent. Her father sends her off to Asheville to live with Aunt Mamie in order to learn girl stuff.

On her train ride she meets famous and would-be famous people in Forrest Gump style (Nellie Bly, Pres. McKinley, Wright Brothers.) In Asheville she meets some boys named Vanderbilt. In the end her Tomboy ways save the day. This movie has potential.

If bad acting and bad accents don't bother you, you might want to watch it with the kids. Of all of the famous people Ociee meets, Nellie Bly is without a doubt the most fascinating.",1288310400,,983,4.218085106382978
2306459,5,B0009NZ2LU,"A happy enjoyable movie for the whole family. It is refreshing to see morals in a movie and not trash talking or unwholesome scenes!
Highly recommended!!",1275436800,,153,4.923076923076923
2306460,4,B0009NZ2LU,"Skylar Day is a great little actress easily equal to Hayley Mills (given the right vehicle).  However, ""The Adventures of Ociee Nash"" is not the right vehicle to showcase her talents.  This story is somewhat empty, leaving the viewer frustrated; hoping for a real story similar to Polyanna.  If you watch Polyanna, or Anne Of Green Gables, you will see just how poor this story is by comparrison.  The music is not very good.  It is very loud throughout most of the story and off cue in every respect.  The acting of Ociee's father is not believable or realistic.  The directing is somewhat poor. I did enjoy seeing Ociee whip the sissy girl in her new neighborhood, and the train ride was very nice.  Overall, this movie missed a good chance to become something really special.  However, after watching it again two or three more times - I discover that the movie is entertaining and fun - entirely owing to Skylar Day... she is just wonderful.  MY 77 year old mother loved this movie!  This caused me to upgrade my original review; rating same from 3 to 4 stars.  Too bad Skylar Day has grown up by now and cannot deliver more movies at this younger age.  I wonder what has become of her?",1270252800,,1190,4.5046728971962615
2306461,5,B0009NZ2LU,"Both young and old will love ""The Adventures of Ociee Nash."" The film takes you back to a gentler age and introduces you to a delightful free spirit of a girl, Ociee Nash. It's a family-firendly film that really entertains and leaves you with the feeling that here is a girl Mark Twain would have liked. It's that kind of film, but instead of having a boy as the main character, Ociee is a very special girl, one who Huck Finn would have accepted for her grit, joyful personality, and sterling character. I recommend this film to any family with young girls or boys. Let them get a glimpse into an age that seems quaint now, but was so American not so very long ago.",1245974400,,666,4.336
2306462,5,B0009NZ2LU,"This is a pleasant movie about a young spirited girl from Mississippi who is sent to her prim and proper Aunt's house in Charlotte, North Carolina, to learn how to ""be a lady.""  She meets delightful characters along the way and maintains her spirit throughout the movie.  I thought the ending was especially  nice with the family all coming together.  It is a very nice and pleasant film.  It is just very likeable all around.  Perfect for family viewing.",1214870400,,455,4.69620253164557
2306463,5,B0009NZ2LU,"I am thoroughly disappointed with the negative reviews on this page.  This world STARVES for clean, family-oriented entertainment and when some is produced, they receive reviews such as those.  I watched this movie with my kids and they LOVE it!  As long as there are producers willing to make good, clean movies for families, my family and I will continue to support them and we will try to persuade others to do the same.  If we do not support this sort of thing, regardless of the quality of acting, Hollywood will win with the smut and filth that is rampant right now before us.  We must not allow that to happen.",1188172800,2,617,4.5225225225225225
2306464,1,B0009NZ2LU,"Being more of a traditional family, the cleaness of the movie was important to me, and that was one of the primary reasons for me choosing this family movie. As far as the content goes, I didn't find much to have issue with although there were a few things that I didn't care for too much that were minor (such as the kids being obnoxious with chewing with their mouths open, throwing rocks and getting into general kid trouble, repeatedly disobeying and not getting much as far as consequence goes other than a little talk, girls being really mean to one another and hitting and rolling around on the ground, children running away with an attitude and kicking things when their parents have made decisions for them that they don't like, adults in the film acting primarly like children, etc...).  However, alot was also good about it, like showing the reasons why these things were bad, teaching some good manners, etc... it's just that I would rather the main character be generally exemplary in behaviour while making a few mistakes, rather than simply doing what she wants to do and getting little talks with some pretty serious stuff, which obviously don't help her as you can see by her going and doing more of the same. Granted, her forwardness and bravery DOES shine through in helping out her fellow man in life saving ways a time or two, but overall I did not care for the main character's morals.

But all that is secondary, and like I said, minor. The thing that I could absolutely NOT stand about the movie was the cheesiness of it. The opening scene I noticed that Ociee was not acting well, she was ACTING as if she KNEW the camera was filming her, and the bulk of the acting in the film continued along these lines, just extremely poorly done. It didn't help that there were just so many ridiculous situations, that I just sat there and rolled my eyes, and overall I was just totally irritated with the entire film. In my opinion it is a very poor movie. And I LIKE to watch children's movie and am a huge fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, Toy Story and others along the same lines, but I cannot stand cheap, cheesy movies which are simply ridiculous. Yes, it's generally clean, and it has some good story lines, but that doesn't save it. If this is what I have to watch in order to have a fully ""clean"" movie, I would rather not!",1174176000,8,2345,4.489461358313817
2306465,5,B0009NZ2LU,Excellent movie!!  I keep it here for the Family to enjoy....especially when the kids all come over!,1169683200,,100,4.882352941176471
2306466,5,B0009NZ2LU,"My daughter recieved this DVD as a gift.  We live in Asheville, NC and have a grandmother named Josephine so it was very touching.  We loved the movie, and plan to order several copies as gifts for other little girls.  It's great to have a little girl as a hero who is attractive, yet not living the stereotype that girls have to be focused on their personal appearance rather than their spirit and integrity.",1152316800,8,409,4.5
2306467,4,B0009NZ2LU,"I think the one-star review above is a bit harsh. This is a kid's movie after all, not the latest Charlie Kaufman mind trip.

As a kid's movie, Ociee Nash works exceedingly well. This is exactly the kind of spirited-away adventure a young girl would love, and it has much to say about building personal strength and developing as an individual, while also showing that even the most difficult people offer something we can learn from. Ociee Nash also has a very positive message about being a woman in a man's world. It's refreshing to find a movie with a classic Disney innocence that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

As mentioned in the above review, the camera work is brilliant, and I agree that in the first few scenes, the acting is a bit stilted, but as the movie progresses, the kids get comfortable with their roles and a wonderful story emerges. Also excellent is the music, the set design, the acting of the secondary talent and the direction. You'd have to have a cold heart not to find something to enjoy about this fresh and wonderful film.",1149206400,7,1059,4.568421052631579

8063965,5,B0009NZ2LU,"This is a delightful movie that no one has ever heard of. I saw it several years ago and have been trying to find it again ever since. It didn't come up easily in search engines because I was spelling Ociee wrong. It is a nice movie for children, and for pre-teen girls. It is very upbeat, a little bit corny but lots of fun. I bought it for myself, but I plan to watch it with my granddaughters. It reminds me a little bit of the first couple of years in the Anne of Green Gables series when Anne was younger and more naive.",1417478400,,525,4.0095238095238095

There are a couple scenes in the beginning where the acting seemed a little flaky, but it got better. Mare Winningham's superb acting skills add a lot to this movie, as the child's aunt. Humorous with touching scenes.",1323993600,,373,4.666666666666667
