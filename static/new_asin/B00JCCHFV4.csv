8649717,5,B00JCCHFV4,"I saw the movie during a flight home and loved every bit of it. I liked the way it was filmed - with the actor playing more than one role, switching from telling his story to an audience stand-up style to the story playing out etc. The review before me will tell you the gist of the film including the conclusion. I won't spoil it and will only reveal this - it's about a man finding out who he is, his relationship with his parents, the particular way he is brought up with an overbearing mother and how this shapes his understanding about himself. The way it is acted drew me in; it's not an action packed movie but it flows gently - sometimes it's very funny, sometimes sad, always engaging. I highly recommend it.",1452124800,3,717,4.318518518518519
8649718,3,B00JCCHFV4,"Directed by and starring the Comdie Francaise actor Guillaume Gallienne, ME, MYSELF AND MUM| offers the entertaining sight of one actor essaying the twin roles of Guillaume, the son; and his mother.  She has had three children; two of them she regards as her sons, but Guillaume is the proverbial ugly duckling.  This is chiefly due to his being uncertain about his sexuality - although born a boy, he thinks of himself either as a girl or a homosexual, he is not sure which.

The basic scenario leads to some comic complications, where Guillaume tries to behave like a girl but finds himself repudiated in a society that refuses to recognize the presence of gender difference.  On occasions we are reminded of the classic sequence in Billy Wilder's SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959), where Jack Lemmon, disguised as a woman, keeps repeating the phrase ""I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl"" in a desperate attempt to convince himself that he should think like a woman.

But what precisely constitutes the difference between ""male"" and ""female"" behavior?  This is what ME, MYSELF AND MUM sets out to explore through the ingenious use of doubling.  The mother comes across as someone content to read books in bed, and walk out in public like a pea-hen, all feathers and flummery.  Guillaume is so impressed with her self-assurance that it's hardly surprising he wants to emulate her.  Yet it seems that Galienne (as director) sacrifices the courage of his convictions in search of a happy ending; having spent three-quarters of the film creating a highly successful comedy that exposes the cultural constructions underpinning our conceptions of gender, he opts to show how Guillaume is actually a full-blown heterosexual at heart.  Once he finds the right girl, his ""true"" sexuality can emerge.  Consequently the film appears nothing more than a rite-of-passage ritual, its tone highly reminiscent of Fifties Hollywood melodramas which showed ""crazy mixed-up kids"" learning the value of home and family life, despite their checkered pasts.

This is highly disappointing; because Gallienne (as an actor) is a highly talented individual, someone whose mannerisms are so brilliantly delineated in the playing of the two central roles that we understand how many so-called ""democratic"" societies try to create absolute distinctions between masculinity and femininity.  Anything in between is regarded as deviant.  We end up wishing that he had followed this argument through to the end, rather than tacking on a sentimental coda.",1440892800,3,2512,5.125
8649719,3,B00JCCHFV4,"One would suppose that the French (referring most especially to those of France and Belgium, but to other Francophones, too), of all people in this world, know a thing or two concerning sexual identity, about the infinite variety of love and of men and women (""Vive la difference!"") who love and lust for each other, and so forth, but that does not mean that they always convey superior worldly advice or (if there be any) offer definitive insights. Maybe they just tend to be right most of the time! But perhaps not in this often tiresomely mannered film, which is rather like a long joke that is just too exquisite for its own good. The North American edition viewed (a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray Disc) of ""Les Garons, et Guillaume,  table!"" (a.k.a. ""Me, Myself, and Mum"") was Seville/Entertainment One 200533-DV, which includes helpful subtitles in English; there are no bonus features included.

Guillaume, alike the character and the actor portraying it, is just too invariably coy. Essentially, the main male character suffers misunderstandings about what role his mother (and his father) really wish for him to live out. It seems like someone would have to be mentally retarded not to get the message more quickly than Guillaume does, since the comedy so constantly and directly poses it, compared to how even ""real life"" (whatever that may be) does so. Well, the mother does send mixed messages, as Guillaume eventually figures out for himself by the end of the movie.

There are some amusing moments in this film. The farcical depiction of the English (Guillaume being packed off at one point in the movie to an English boarding school) with all of their world-famous eccentricity, is funny. So are Guillaume's absurd dealings with gay men. (To this film's credit, the real gays with whom he comes into contact, unlike those whom Guillaume has imagined for himself, are just too relentlessly strong and masculine for him to identify with!)  Anyway, there is enough to enjoy in the film to make watching it worthwhile. That is so despite the many boring stretches, due to too much preciosity, which really should not have been needed. Guillaume finds, after all of these battles of the sexes, those especially within himself, that he is a man, an heterosexual one, at that. How and in what way, in spite of the overbearing mother whom he also portrays, is left here for the reader to discover for himself!",1439337600,,2412,4.861313868613139
