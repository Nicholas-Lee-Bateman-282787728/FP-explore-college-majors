8147682,5,B000IY0BNE,"This is an absolute must for any SSJ fans. It is kind of cute they use subtitles on the songs on the Germany portion, which any true fan doesn't need. The Stone Pony sessions show the energy this band has. Sorry I waited so long, only wish they had a high def version.",1390003200,,268,4.0754716981132075
8147683,5,B000IY0BNE,"Having grownup in Jersey, Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes are must listen to music. Best party/bar band rockin the house! Love this concert DVD!",1362700800,,148,4.96
8147684,5,B000IY0BNE,"Most everybody has heard of that other guy from NJ (Bruce Springsteen), but Southside Johnny should be heard too! This is a great concert by a great singer and band and deserves its own accolades. I don't like to make the comparison, but if Bruce had not been so successful, I think Southside Johnny would have been right up there too!",1352764800,,335,4.508196721311475
8147685,5,B000IY0BNE,"This was a nice reminder of just how much fun Southside Johhny was to watch and listen to.. Makes me wish I had seen him live in a bar back in the day... My wife had never heard him, and now wants to get some more of his material..",1350864000,,231,3.7346938775510203
8147686,4,B000IY0BNE,"I just got this the other night.  Listened to most of it twice.  Not the most impressive surround mix.  But this is Jukes music so it doesn't really require one.  It sounds great considering the age of the concerts.

Its nice to see an older performance and a more recent performance.  The concert from the nineties showcases the recently recorded (at the time) Better Days album.  Personally one of my favorite albums in my collection.  The music and performance has all of the energy (and more) or the original recording.",1256860800,3,523,4.733333333333333
8147687,5,B000IY0BNE,"Having never been to a Southside Johnny concert before, I've been missing the live aspect of being a fan, with the exception of the Stone Pony concert which was released back in the early nineties.  And that was in a tightly packed club, which didn't really allow for the band to stretch out, and do their stage thing properly.  After nearly every song on this new release from Munich Germany I found myself saying ""Wow!"" , ""Awesome!"" , and things like that.  The band was in super-charged form that night, and tight as any unit I've ever heard, including the E St. Band.  The filming of this concert was really well done too, with lots of interesting camera angles, and on-time shots that make this one of the best all-time concerts ever caught on film in my estimation, and I've see a lot.  The booklet that comes with it is also more comprehensive than any DVD release I've ever bought, coming in at over 18 pages - in small print!  This is the Rosetta Stone for Southside Johnny fans.  Someone at Charly finally decided to do SJ, and his career proud.  So without reservation, buy this - you won't be sorry!",1250467200,11,1111,4.492537313432836
8147688,5,B000IY0BNE,"I've been waiting for another Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes DVD for a while. With ""The Fever"", you get two shows for the price of one. First is in Germany, where Johnny has a strong following. It's a 1985 show. Strong, tight show. Then in the features you get the Jukes circa 1991 at their home stomping grounds of ""The Stone Pony"" in Asbury Park. Though it is somewhat of a promotional project it's another hard core electric show with some Jersey boys as guest performers. Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes is by far the best bar band ever. I've seen them twice out here in Colorado in recent years for FREE and am looking forward to their next visit",1248912000,3,662,4.434426229508197
