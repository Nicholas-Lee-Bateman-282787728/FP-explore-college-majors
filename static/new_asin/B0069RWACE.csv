4980716,1,B0069RWACE,"I hated this movie! I love Christina Ricci, she was the only thing this movie had going for it. The rest of it was surprisingly dirty and uncomfortable! Two of the subplots were extremely disappointing. One was where one character was trying to keep his penis from falling off due to a curse from a stripper witch. The other was the ""pretty princess"" calling men in to please her in her trailer; the guy would go enter the trailer, and then the trailer would be shaking and she's moaning & groaning in a suggestive way, but she's really just a crazy person because she had the guy only painting her nails for her. The whole movie was a bit disturbing and unsettling. Very disappointed.",1488758400,6,685,4.532258064516129

4980720,3,B0069RWACE,"This movie is just barely ok. Not a complete waste of time, but only because I am a Christina Ricci and Matthew Lillard fan. The idiot that runs around with the puppet on his hand is just plain obnoxious, but then that's probably the way he's supposed to be. If I could give this movie 2.5 stars I would have.

4980749,4,B0069RWACE,"This is a Fun Frolic at the Faire! While the story is a bit formulaic in spots, the romantic heart of the story is fun. Although a few of the characters could be described as parodies of types, most of the characters are both well-defined and believable. Add to that an opportunity to see Renaissance Faire activities up close, and from the other side of the mirror, so to speak, and this was a pleasant evening's entertainment.

Hope you enjoy it, as well!",1457308800,4,457,4.506024096385542

Everyone else does well.  The villain in particular owns the role.  When the character breaks his character (thanks to a phone call) is one of my favorite moments in the film.

I am going through ren faire with drawl and this movie makes you feel like you were there again. The main lead is kind of bad acting but it works for his character. Love it!  It is very sexual humor but if you have ever been to the faire, it is just like the jokes there.

I guess it got panned critically but I thought it was a cute little movie...I liked it enough to buy it.

4980791,1,B0069RWACE,"First off, only been to one Renaissance Faire so far, and don't know much about the behind-the-scenes things that go on, so i can't judge the movie much based on that. Still, the costumes were great, and the actors did good with what they had to work with. The only downside is that the movie focused way too much on sexual-humor, and didn't have much in the line of clean non-sex based humor.

Anyways, the movie starts out with an egotistic football player who has been failing/ditching out on some of his classes. Most of his teachers write it off, since he's a big-shot football star, with the exception of his history professor. Under the condition he joins the local Renaissance Faire for a few weeks will he get the write off necessary to pass the class so he can continue playing football.

While at the faire he learns there's a distinct separation from the nobles and peasants, in which they're determined by their performance at the finale. He falls for another new-comer to the faire, Kate who is also thrown into the peasant class. Befriended by Rusty Crockett, who having lost the previous faire, is one of the leaders of the peasants.

The downside as mentioned afore is that most of the humor is sex-related, due to a past love having hired the witches to put a curse on Rusty Crockett's penis. Too much of the movie focuses on this aspect and it would be alot better without it.

Prince Rank, the leader of the nobles, makes a suitable nemesis to the peasants. Too egotistical for his own good, while sometimes amusing, although you can't help but celebrate when he gets what he deserves in the end.

Roy the Jester with his unicorn Horny, is well, crass. Simply put. No need to go further as the unicorn says it all.

The witches don't dress anything like the witches or sorcerers you'd typically see portrayed in fairytale stories. They dress and act more like prostitutes.

The plot is way overshadowed with sexual references. It's possible to write a clean love story, but this wasn't it. Very disappointed. As a lover of renaissance/medieval fiction and romance stories, i don't recommend this movie at all.",1394236800,2,2129,4.6916890080428955
4980792,5,B0069RWACE,"This movie was very heart-warming, fun, and definitely pays tribute to the wonders of the Renaissance Faire. I would definitely recommend this to anyone,",1391212800,,153,5.416666666666667
4980793,5,B0069RWACE,Watched all the way through once though it was just playing really fast then kind of slide show with most of the dialogue. It was absolutely delightful! We watched again when it played right and it was even better!,1389830400,,214,4.512820512820513
4980794,5,B0069RWACE,Great movie.  Funny and cute. Love the ending!  Great actors. Love the costumes. Benny the dog is cute too! 5 stars,1389139200,,115,4.428571428571429
4980815,2,B0069RWACE,"This is a pretty embarrassing movie for Christina Ricci , Matthew Lillard, & Ann-Margret.
Did they have a spare weekend free, or were they just wanting to have an excuse to do something (anything) together ? No, I'm guessing that they did it for the paycheck in between better films, sad, just sad. It might have been a decent movie if they hadn't insisted on making the renaissance fete all farce and no fun. Owen Benjamin was truly awful, either that or he's such a good actor that the stupid character he played was totally believable...nah, he & his character were cringingly bad. This comedy is too sexy for kids and too dull for adults, so the target audience must be the senile who are entertained by simple movement & bright colors",1386374400,,739,4.606060606060606

4980817,4,B0069RWACE,"Not the best movie, but I have to say the tall guy who portrayed the football guy was pretty funny, he had to have had all the best lines, although he looked more like someone from a Faire then a football player. It was reasonably funny and entertaining.",1383955200,,254,4.3125
4980818,5,B0069RWACE,"Cute love/hate/love movie for all renaissance festival buffs.  Highly recommend this comedy with a few twists.  Plus, anything with Ann Margaret is bound to be good, right?",1373760000,2,172,5.333333333333333
4980819,5,B0069RWACE,"This movie was so horrible, so crass, so disgusting it was great. It has nothing good to recommend it, yet it was the most hilarious movie I've seen in a long time. My favorite part was the peeing goat. Do not, under any circumstances, pay money to watch this, but get a little drunk or extremely exhausted and give it a whirl.

And to those 'rennies' having issues: I've gone to this actual Ren Faire, and have gone to many others since. It's a freakin' movie! Unclench the tights and enjoy life for crying out loud.",1373241600,5,517,4.385416666666667
4980820,4,B0069RWACE,"What made me take a look at this was the fact that the movie was shot at the Renaissance Faire in Holly, Michigan.  I have been to the festival many times and loved seeing areas I am familiar with.  Never-the-less, Christina Ricci has a certain charm about her and the story is a romantic comedy that holds it's own.  Buy it at a good price and you will be entertained.",1371945600,4,369,4.242857142857143
4980821,1,B0069RWACE,"I have been working at and going to Reniassance Faires for 14 year. I had low expectations going in. I expected a stupid RomCom set in a slightly interesting setting, perhaps with some costumes I would enjoy. Even that was too much to expect.
What this movie gets right about being on cast for Reiniassance Faire: the costumes and some of the sets.
The costumes were actually quite good, aside from the ""witch"" charater. The Nobles garb was good, aside form a few nit-picky complaints the Townsfolk garb was good. The outdoor sets were spot on, but I think that is largely due to the fact that they shot it at an actual Faire.

The thing is, for someone who participates in and enjoys faires, this was offensive. The witches attempted raping of Crocket, the forced servetude, the joust, all of it was offensive.

The Faire is for the patrons. Once the Faire ends for the day, eveyone changes into regular clothes. We are regular people and have no power over one another. It only works because we all want to be there. We all like the charaters we play. I /choose/ to be a Washer Woman. I don't want to be a noble. There is not Grand Finale to determine who is noble. Some of us live on site, but not where the patron's can see. And there is only faire on the weekends. There is no Fetch Boy/Girl. The Pickle Sellers/Game Booth workers/Jousters are not part of cast. There is no such thing as witches (or at least not like this) The Queen does not preform weddings. You cannot just show up the day of faire and join the cast. There are classes and workshops on things like dialect, character development, history so that we can present an enjoyable and educational experiance for the patrons.

There are many more things I could complain about, but I will stop here, as I doubt anyone but other rennies cares.

TL;DR Stupid and Offensive. Give it a miss.",1366848000,3,1854,4.492581602373887
4980822,1,B0069RWACE,"This film is embarrassingly juvenile, and poorly written. It's hard to blame the actors, given what they had to work with. I must admit that I only watched about the first 10 minutes, and then skipped forward looking for anything to redeem this production. I did not find it.",1363564800,,275,4.63265306122449

4980835,2,B0069RWACE,"The premise is interesting; however, the execution leaves much to be desired. A jock in danger of failing is sentenced by his professor to work at a Renaissance Faire for three weeks in the summer. He comes into this role possessing an initial contempt and general disregard for the Faire and all involved. He does develop a bit more in personality and character as the film progresses; however, this story left me shaking my head many times. I love Renaissance Faires; however, I do not love this movie. If you do not have to pay to watch it, perhaps; however, it's mediocre at best and lame to offensive at worst.",1356307200,3,615,4.6
4980836,3,B0069RWACE,"I thought the 1 star review was overly harsh.  This is not the best movie in the world, but it is a cute, funny romance obviously set in a Renaissance Faire.  If you are in the mood for a lighthearted romp, then watch this movie.  There is nothing overtly offending and the 'adult' jokes are easily explained or overlooked by 'non-adults'...my 4 year old daughter loved it!  This movie would definitely be enjoyed by chick flick connoisseurs, Renaissance Faire fans, history re-enactment folks or anyone interested in a witty, fun romance.",1354320000,4,539,4.8901098901098905

4980839,2,B0069RWACE,"The movie was made in my back yard so to speak so was intrigued - however it is a very silly movie.  I know a lot of people cast as extras, myself included, otherwise I wouldn't even bother.  Some good acting, and some horrible acting.  Ann Margaret was really one of the best ... not a good representation of a real renaissance festival (I know I worked at one) but it is what it is.  Sadly.",1342137600,,392,4.118421052631579

4980841,4,B0069RWACE,"Films like ""Elizabeth"" (with Cate Blanchett) and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" have led to the genre of ""Costume Drama"". I'm just wondering if the same can be applied to a comedy. This movie was a light, romantic comedy. And I like these types of movies well enough. Having been to a number of ""Renaissance Festivals"" in a variety of states, I've seen some pretty spectacular costumes and some pathetic ones as well. This movie offers a glimpse into some of the better outfits a ""rennie"" could ever wear. Kudos to the Renaissance Costume Designer, Donna Buckley, for her work here. It's worth a look just to check them out! And jousting too!",1334793600,11,635,4.678571428571429
4980842,2,B0069RWACE,"I was drawn in by the promise of a movie with a unique setting -- as far as I know, this is the only movie that is set at a Renaissance Faire, which I thought was brilliant. Christina Ricci and Matthew Lillard are also good actors, and I was hoping for a cute little movie. But within minutes, my excitement took a sharp turn. The acting and storyline are just plain BAD. The performances are so over-the-top, especially by Chris Wylde, that they were more akin to what you'd expect from a goofy kids movie (like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers). This was so true that I thought that kids might have been the audience they wanted, except that there were some definite adult themes, and so it really became this aimless, horrible thing. I don't know how so many well-known actors got roped into doing this flick, but it was pathetic and a struggle to watch the whole way through.",1333929600,,875,4.475
4980843,5,B0069RWACE,"So I found out about this movie last year, during a class i was working in.  I found out it had been shot at my school, Mott Community College, back in 2009.  After much research on release dates i found it on amazon to rent last month.  So i did, and found it quite funny.  I didn't go in expecting anything, but i do enjoy most work by christina ricci, and matthew lillard.  It was neat seeming a portion of my school in there, along with the Michigan ren. fest as most of the staging of the movie.  But if you are looking for a few good laughs, this would be a good movie to see.

The sense of humor isn't 'family,' but is in the earthy manner of real Ren Faires.  Ricci and Benjamin's characters are believably 22ish but the actors were both about 29.  Ricci is a charming pixie.  Benjamin's performance is good but he needed some gym time to be more convincing as a football star.

The concept definitely had merit (in fact Jack Black was originally slated to helm a straight comedy version that was later scrapped), but the writing is so confusingly bad that not even the usually charming Owen Benjamin could win a smile from me during the nearly two hour run-time.

I had a movie I've seen before (and own the dvd of actually) on my watchlist - instead of watching that I went to ""customers also watched"" and found a cute romantic comedy. Finished that - ""customers also watched"" and found this one.

First let me say I love going to Ren Faires. They are fun and interesting and different. So I was intrigued when I saw this one. To me this movie felt like it was poking fun at the Ren Faires - but I also have been ""behind the scenes"" at other events and know that sometimes it can be a little like this. So I kept watching. Because I wanted to like it... I'm not sure I did... But it was ok.

As a parent, I would suggest watching it yourself before allowing kids watch. There are a good bit of suggestive moments. It does have a few redeeming moments to go with that though.

The part that floored me the most though is the song during the ending credits - TobyMac's ""Made to Love You"". I was not expecting that song with this movie at all.",1490918400,,1025,4.166666666666667
