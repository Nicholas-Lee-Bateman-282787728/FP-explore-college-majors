2626067,5,B000H4JH58,"Hey, no matter what the title, the movie is A-Number 1 in my book. And I wish that Code 2 would be removed so it would be easier for a lot of people to get a hold of this movie.

I'm a big Ted Danson fan myself and I agree that he did a great job on the part of James Praagh, but he doesn't remotely look anything like him. But be that as it may, the whole 3 hours is indeed worthwhile and a keeper besides. I just hope one day I can get a copy; as always I'm  watching the prices flex. Hopefully soon, they'll be to my liking.

Happy movie watching.

2626068,5,B000H4JH58,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film in every way. It was well-written, acted, directed, camera work, music...everything! Ted Danson did a superb job portraying trance work and did not overact. The child actors in the movie were fantastic. Queen Latifah was great. What can I say? Plus, it moved me to tears and had me biting my nails. Finally, I felt spiritual lifted and encouraged. All this and I didn't have to watch one car chase, one woman being raped or any killer-slasher-horror psycho-killers running around with long knives on Halloween. I'm getting my own copy for friends. Thanks James Van Praagh for this film.",1160611200,8,617,4.9423076923076925
2626069,5,B000H4JH58,"Why they changed the title is questionable since ""Living With The Dead"" is much more appropriate. Husband and wife, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, head an extremely fine cast in a film that will hold your attention regardless of whether you define it as fiction or non. Ted does a credible Van Praagh but Mary steals the show with her superb portayal of a borderline skeptic detective who puts her reputation on the line. And she looks terrific. A suprising entree is Jack Palance. The old pro never misses a beat and can still steal a scene. The same can be said of Michael Moriarty who continues to be one of our finer character actors.

  The real deal, Mr. Van Praagh himself, can be seen in a quick cameo as the church organ player.

  3 hours of fine film. Nice job.",1158451200,26,774,4.453900709219858

I'm not particularly fond of Ted Danson, but he does a pretty believable job portraying James Van Pragh.

2626103,1,B000H4JH58,Had this on VHS. It is Ted Danson's best role along with Dad. It was captioned. The DVD description said it was subtitled. Well it is - in Spanish. Display options list English but it is not there. Absolutely loved this film. But this is so sad. I'm hard of hearing and depend on captions or subtitles. Why would they make an English speaking film with only Spanish subtitles?,1461196800,6,376,4.463768115942029

2626108,5,B000H4JH58,"I have lost. I don't bounce. People don't know what do do, silence is deafening. On a brighter note, I have found signs of them in my home mostly, when home alone..subtle, but great.
(You have to want to hear from them. Not all can break thru to the living. But some do.)
My elder has recently  joined my siblings now, after a miserable ending.
There really is little that others can do but token gestures like a note, a text, something with no relation to loss is fine. Remembering a loved one- priceless.
Of course most of this is best offeredafter the weeks of shock and ceremonies. Unless you already are vrry close.
Ok, this movie does help outside skeptics of the honest, true stories ;f those who see people, feel their experience, and can shatr it w;th survorors. In this spellbinding, mystery here, law enforcement has been contacted and in other times law enforcement contacted Van Prague.
Skeptics won't find this too outrageous. Those who ache long after loss, will cry if they watch this alone, and are safe. I learned a bit t;o late that one should never supress tears. I got very deathly ill trying to carry on, hold the course and all that. Yes sometimes in public one carefully/dicretely  wipes their eyes + supresses. I cried thru this movie at times when it had zero empathy for the actor that affected me. But this movie goes way into your private, personal loss/es and circumstances.
I think James Van Prague is our best living psychic. He does not volunteer, he does not have answwrs to everything, but his manner of revealing the bi,s and pieces, not to mention our most troubling concerns over our loss and the lost, really take some fear away. If you want to learn to let the small signs into your life, he has wriiten a few books, and hopefully will continue to appear in cities or on the tube, so anyone can see this man for themselves.
Hes not the commercial reality show type. He is humble and generous and gets exhausted from sharing and helping others. His books offer some insights to afterlife, non-preachy. Enlightening, and hopeful.
The movie is pretty cool, no matter what. Better than scary monster movies or the best mysteries. (+No preachin).
For me, there is nothing like a movie based on truthful reality.  And for me, about 4 good cries did not hurt.",1456444800,,2292,4.612745098039215
2626109,4,B000H4JH58,I recently watched this on Tru TV and thought it was excellent.  It did get off to a bit of a shaky start but if you perservere it becomes really gripping and tense and keeps you guessing until the very end!.  Everyone's acting was fantastic.  The only criticism was that could an old slighly built lady really kidnap and  overpower strong young teenage boys and drag them unwillingly to their graves?  But this is based on a true story so truth is probably stranger than fiction.,1455408000,,480,4.534883720930233

2626121,5,B000H4JH58,"I think this is Ten Danson's best role.  It is a extremely emotional role and he played it fabulously.  I would bet he was a bit tired after the film was completed.  High suspense for sure.  I actually had a fast beating heart at the end.  The plot is hard to describe without seeing the film,  but it deals with those who have died, but their spirits have not passed on due to some problems with their deaths.  They reach out to humans they think can find the answer and release them.  There are many,  many turns and twists to this story, but the viewer will not lose the story itself.

2626190,5,B000H4JH58,"Great movie for my spiritual friends.  This true story is about 175 minutes long, and is based on James Van Praagh's #1 New York Times best-seller ""Talking to Heaven: A Medium's Message of Life After Death,"" and is the complete 2-part mini series.  The movie features several big stars,  Ted Danson plays James Van Praagh, a very famous medium (famous now--not then--in the story).  Jack Palance plays Ted's/James' father; Queen Latifah plays an employee, turned friend, who helps Ted/James accept his inner-self.

The movie begins with young James, seeing people and seeing things happen through dimentional portals, but whenever he tries to tell someone, it cause chaos, because they cannot see what James sees.  To make matters worse, he is in Catholic school, so it only convinces teachers he is siding with the devil.  So, James grows up taught to supress all of this supernatural stuff and not even talk about it.  As a matter of fact, he wishes he could just turn it off---but it wasn't meant to be.

Fast-forward about 40 years or so, and Mom has a stroke.  James hires a lady to work for him (Queen Latifa), and she begins talking about things her psychic told her, but James said he has had his fill of the supernatural.  She gives him a Ouija Board, and encourages him.  And James begins to see more folks from the other side.  The next thing you know, he begins helping police detective Mary Steenburgen find missing children.  Especially awesome, and the main theme of the movie, is the 7 young (deceased) boys, who take James on a journey toward solving their murders and helping them continue their path on the other side.

Walk with James as he experiences the double-edge sword -- the psychic gift and the pain of having and accepting the gift.  For those of you who want to believe there is more to life than most people see and for those of you who believe the dead are closer than most folks think, this movie is very enjoyable.",1404777600,2,1948,4.668621700879766

It is not only fascinating - but Very suspenseful!! - At times - a nail-biter!!
It depicts much of how James gifts emerged growing up and the pains and challenges with it.
I say it is both well-cast - as the actors did a Great job!! - And also miscast - as actor Ted Danson is very tall - and James - well somewhat shorter. Mary - Ted's wife (I admit - I can't spell her name) is a great actress and seems like a great person.

Just as he tries to quit, everyone presses him to go on to help solve a 30 year old murder with really spooky consequences. Is he the victim, the innocent bystander or maybe the perpetrator? Will the case get solved?

The film starts out very slow paced, for a while you think you may be watching a religious documentary. It seems to deviate this way and that off course.  Then in the second half the pace picks up and you get absorbed and intrigued as it gets spookier and spookier. By the end you find that the film did not deviate and every word, every gesture forms a tapestry to review an overall picture.

A surprising plus is the quality of acting. I was especially surprised at Queen Latifah's port rail of cancer patient Midge Harmon",1260576000,2,992,4.4944444444444445

I, like many others have seen the Psycho's, the Silence of the lambs, and movies of this type of genre, but I found that this movie about the famous psychic was the most intriguing and best who done  movie I have ever seen. The writers keep you running in many directions looking for killers and reasonings, and the actors, Danson, Steenbergen, Palance and other play their roles to what I would consider Oscar nominations. It makes me wonder why movies like this never get the acclaim they deserve and others because they go to Cannes get the Oscars when work like this is shelved, kind of like Gran Torino was in 2009.

When I bought the DVD, it didn't occur to me to check for closed captioning or English subtitles.  I thought everyone put those on their DVDs now a days.

To find one of my favorite movies is unwatchable and behind the times technically, really disappoints me.  I feel I have lost money on the DVD.",1234915200,5,422,4.160493827160494

I have always enjoyed ESP, the paranormal and the psychic worlds and as a result this movie was right up my alley.  Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Queen Latifa were wonderful.  And the ending was a total surprise.
