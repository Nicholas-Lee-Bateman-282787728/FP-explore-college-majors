Unsung heroes is an okay movie definitely odd situation between boy and the uncles,but it does pull you in and you want to know what happens.",1377216000,2,223,4.333333333333333

5188893,5,B008XAT1GI,"An odd combination of films, but both are funny and touching.
Two true gems, Steve Allen at his best, and a great oddball family tale.",1356998400,,134,4.4
5188894,5,B008XAT1GI,"Mill Creek does it again, this time with two dramedies, BOTH of these are PG-13.
Both are in thier original widescreen ratios, and have optional english captions.

The PQ and AQ are great with this release.

A Simple Twist Of Fate stars the great Steve Martin.

Unstrung Heroes stars Andie McDowell and John Turtorro.

Mill Creek is really releasing some stellar products lately!

8531943,5,B008XAT1GI,An absolute need to see movie. A Simple Twist of Faith is a heart warming touching movie. As a collector of movies I am updating my VHS films to DVD or Blue-Ray. This movie is on my top ten list and I was extremely happy to be able to get it along with another movie as a bonus. I have yet to watch the second movie. The package arrived in a timely manner and is in great condition.,1401235200,,382,3.91025641025641
8531944,5,B008XAT1GI,"I had seen A Simple Twist of Fate years ago and remember enjoying it. It's not ""typical"" Steve Martin. It's not broad comedy. In fact, while it is amusing here and there, it is not a comedy at all. It's a character piece, put in a modern setting, based on a classic novel. Martin's understating acting is a plus here. And the second film, Unstrung Heroes, was a surprise for me because I'd never even heard of it before. It is a good match for the other film. A character piece about dealing with grief and loss. It was obviously done on a fairly low budget, but the actors are all great and they carry the film forward excellently. It's sort of a play on the concept of melodrama without totally going there, if that makes any sense. Anyway, for the money, two very enjoyable films. Recommended.",1394755200,2,796,4.421768707482993
8531945,5,B008XAT1GI,"Love, love, love this movie.  Steve Martin wrote, directed and starred in this heartwarming story!  I received the DVD in great condition and it plays beautifully.  I have watched it about 10 times already!",1387238400,3,206,5.0
