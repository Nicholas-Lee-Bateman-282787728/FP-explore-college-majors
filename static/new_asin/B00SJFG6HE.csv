6990404,3,B00SJFG6HE,"I would have given this set 5 stars if they would have included  ""Young man with a horn""  and  ""ll see you in my dreams"" and they may have left out  ""Please don't eat the daisies""  and ""The glass bonntom boat"". Doris Day always and still is my favourite singer and moviestar and I have all her musical movies on CD ond some of her comedies also but I can't understand why they left out some of her best movies. Otherwise I certainly would have bought the set allthough I already have the DVD's. Furthermore why didn't they make it a Blu Ray collection then I'm sure they would heve sold a lot more copies, I certainly would have bought it then.",1428883200,8,644,4.245901639344262
6990405,5,B00SJFG6HE,"Nice set from Day's Universal films.  But again this boxset contains no Blu Rays.  Both PILLOW TALK and MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH have already been released as single discs on BR so why not the rest of Day's films from this set?  If you do not already own these films the set is bargain priced. FOLLOWUP: 5/11/15.  I bought this set since I wanted MIDNIGHT LACE.  I already have three of the six films.  Two thumbs down for Universal.  All they did is take MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH from the Hitchcock set, the Day-Hudson films from that set, etc.  Looks like they pulled the discs from these other sets as you can see by the labels on each disc. At least the studio could have prepped a new documentary on Day to go with this set even if it was 5 to 10 minutes long.  Nice packaged, but recycled discs.  4 stars for the films, 2 stars for Universal for slopping together this set.",1428796800,15,873,4.204819277108434
6990406,5,B00SJFG6HE,"As a big fan of Doris Day I own the three box sets of her films already released.  Yes, I agree, why weren't they remastered for Blu Ray?  That would be the reason for me buying the set otherwise I am duplicating what I already have. In addition, JUMBO and CALAMITY JANE have already been released on Blu Ray. I do not think anything new has been added to this set. Nice packaging though.",1428537600,2,388,4.22972972972973
6990407,5,B00SJFG6HE,"THESE MOVIES ARE EXCELLENT AND HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE AS A SET.  I AM DISAPPOINTED HOWEVER, THAT THEY DID NOT DO A BLU-RAY RELEASE AT THIS TIME.  DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.",1428537600,2,168,4.566666666666666
6990408,5,B00SJFG6HE,"I agree with Michael, this DVD set of Doris Day's movies will be excellent. Providing  the prints are re-mastered okay. Doris Day was the most popular movie star of her day. Day! She's just as beloved today because of who she is and what she stands for. I believe Doris is truly a good person and I've never heard anyone say anything bad about her. I have all these films of course, but I think it's wonderful that these films are being made more affordable. I hope Doris is doing well and is happy and healthy. God bless her.",1427241600,7,526,4.313131313131313

6990522,4,B00SJFG6HE,"This is not a review of the movies, just an informational post on what movies are included.
This set includes 15 movies on 15 DVDs. Titles and descriptions from Warner Bros:

01) Romance On The High Seas - Doris Day makes her maiden film voyage, setting sail on romantic seas as Mrs. Elvira Kent. Meanwhile, the real Elvira stays home to spy on her presumably philandering hubby as the husband hires a spy to snoop on his supposedly voyaging wife.
02) My Dream Is Yours - Talent agent Doug Blake is giving 100% to earn his 10%. He walks away from his arrogant singing star and must scramble to discover another who will shine even brighter -- and he does, in Doris Day's effervescent songstress Martha Gibson.
03) It's A Great Feeling - No director. No leading lady. No problem. If no one will work with ambitious actor Jack Carson, he'll just pull his own movie together. There's a talented kid in the studio commissary, played by Doris Day, eager for her big break in this bright Hollywood filmmaking spoof.
04) Tea For Two - Doris Day is a sunny sensation in this flapper-era musical romp as a woman who strikes a bet that she can say ""no"" to everything for 48 hours. She's determined, even if it means saying ""no"" when the fella she loves pops the question.
05) Lullaby Of Broadway - Doris sang and danced divinely in this musical delight about a singer newly arrived in New York -- and destined for Broadway fame. Savor the title tune, Cole Porter's ""Just One of Those Things,"" ""Somebody Loves Me"" and six more swell songs.
06) On Moonlight Bay - Doris Day and Gordon MacRae team for spoonin', croonin' and swoonin' On Moonlight Bay, based on Booth Tarkington's Penrod stories, in this heaping of tuneful, romantic, World War I-era Midwestern American life.
07) April In Paris - The government wants Ethel Barrymore to represent the American theater at an arts exposition in Paris. But her invitation goes instead to Miss Ethel ""Dynamite"" Jackson (Doris Day), a very blonde, very brassy chorus girl. And she's going to give Paris an Eiffel!
08) By The Light Of The Silvery Moon - Young lovers Doris Day and Gordon MacRae return in a moonlit sequel to On Moonlight Bay. Like its predecessor, this draws from Booth Tarkington's Penrod stories for its portraits of heartland mirth, values and ""warm hearts, cold feet"" romance.
09) Calamity Jane - Doris Day and Howard Keel fuss, feud and fall in love as Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickock in this entertainment mother lode, featuring wide-open Technicolor Western spaces, lots of high-stepping dances and the classic ballad (and '50s megahit) ""Secret Love.""
10) Lucky Me - Don't step on a crack. Open an umbrella only when outdoors. Struggling performer Candy Williams (Doris Day) has many ways to ward off bad luck. Maybe that's why the most unlucky day of her life eventually turns out to be the luckiest!
11) Love Me Or Leave Me - Doris Day gives a career-best dramatic performance as roaring '20s songstress Ruth Etting, who had everything -- the looks, the wiles, the smokey jazz voice, the it. She also had a Chicago gangster smothering her in an obsessive grip she escaped at great peril.
12) The Pajama Game - Doris Day and John Raitt lead a Broadway-seasoned cast in this entertaining tale of labor discord, in which negotiations involve snappy stars, terrific tunes by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, and dynamic dances choreographed by Bob Fosse.
13) Please Don't Eat The Daisies - Doris Day brings her trademark radiance to the role of Kate Mackay -- who has four boys, a country fixer-upper and a drama-critic hubby -- as she hangs in through thick and thicker in this jovial comedy full of breezy family fun.
14) Billy Rose's Jumbo - Radiant Doris Day sings beloved Rodgers and Hart tunes and does her own horseback-riding tricks in this big-time, big-top extravaganza bursting with laughter and love, song and dance, circus stunts and star power, and a mighty talented elephant!
15) The Glass Bottom Boat - In this hilarious blending of romantic comedy and the era's burgeoning spy-movie genre, Doris Day plays a Girl Friday at a hush-hush aeronautics think tank who chaotically sets out to clear her name when colleagues suspect she's an espionage agent.

It includes 7 out of 8 movies from Doris Day Collection Volume 1:
Billy Rose's Jumbo
Calamity Jane
