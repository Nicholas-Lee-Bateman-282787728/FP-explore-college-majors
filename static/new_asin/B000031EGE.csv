7916413,5,B000031EGE,Sutherland is Sutherland and the rest of the cast is good. The orchestra is good and so is the video and audio.,1395446400,,111,4.090909090909091
7916414,5,B000031EGE,"I saw her first performance of this opera and there were a lot of mistakes!!!so I didn't think I was going to like this performance,but,I was TOTALLY SURPRISED(!!!)by this performance. The sensitivity and love she showed and her total involvement and dedication made a fantastic performance!! I was hypnotized by DAME JOAN.Lot's of history there for me!!!!",1358121600,,356,5.2631578947368425
7916415,5,B000031EGE,Joan Sutherland is amazing in this production. Even when she was not young she could sing and bring a credible interpretation and together with conductor Richard Bonynge they can take this opera to a different new level.,1334016000,,220,4.972972972972973
7916416,5,B000031EGE,"this was a new opera to me, one i'd never even heard of until i bought the dvd of the essential Joan Sutherland. As always she was perfect in the role and i found the opera very moving; i loved it",1322870400,,196,3.8048780487804876
7916417,5,B000031EGE,"I enjoyed the whole performance.  Dame Joan Sutherland has a wonderful stage presence.  While a minor role,  John Wegner' performance as Prince Bouillon is excellent.",1204502400,2,166,5.56
7916418,5,B000031EGE,"I loved it.  I had this on LP many years ago, but the very realistic groans of Adriana dying of poison were too much for me, so I chucked the set.  However, when I had those LPs, I was familiar with the life of Adriana (I am no longer), and I could not believe the librettist would take a life so complex and interesting and boil it down to a plot like this.  It was an adequate plot, but not when drawn from the life of Adriana.  (Yes, I know she was French, but I'm saying Adriana anyway.)  The sets were rich and colorful.  The acting and singing by everyone were wonderful.  The first act baffled me with all the passing of letters back and forth, I could make no sense of it and expected to be helplessly lost.  Then from act two on the plot became quite simple, no plot at all.  This is not my kind of music, it seemed like continuous recitative with no distinct tunes.  But it was beautiful.  It is not Sutherland's usual fare, though there are plenty of high notes for her to hit, and yes, you keenly perceptive people you, she's too old for the part.  So what.  I loved and recommend it.  It was a pleasure.  Also, I identified with the old man who had a secret love for her, and his horrible pain.  It was in fact all pain.  But it was beautiful nonetheless.",1095033600,8,1268,4.152263374485597
7916419,2,B000031EGE,"But this role was not for her. The performance is dreadful. Go for Olivero, Dessi or Tebaldi. This DVD is a shame!",1073865600,4,114,4.2272727272727275
7916420,2,B000031EGE,"Adriana Lecouvreur is usually portrayed by sopranos (many past their prime) who still have some heft to their voices and can produce a dramatic punch.  Joan Sutherland unfortunately has neither.  Her technique carries  her through the music but she barely explores the dramatic possibilities.  Her declamation during ""Giusto Cielo"" and her entrance in Act One  is embarassingly bad and her death scene is reminiscent of Lucia di  Lammermoor. The production is a head-scratcher.  Why set the opera in the  late nineteenth century when Adrienne Lecouvreur was a historical figure of  pre-Revolutionary French theater.  The reference to Moliere being in the  audience during the first act thus makes no sense nor does the presence of  an Abbe.  The supporting cast is more than adequate (except for John Shaws  woofy Michonnet) though they seem to have to watch Bonynge continually.  The sets and costumes are quite opulent",949017600,13,920,5.248275862068965
