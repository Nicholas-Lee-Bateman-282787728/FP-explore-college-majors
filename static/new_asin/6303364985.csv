663032,5,6303364985,I really enjoy this tape I felt like I was on stage with the reunion itself.  Does anyone know if the show where Carol Burnett and Tim Conway laughed the whole time and never did the skit.  Everyone time they looked at one another the started to laugh.  It was in Black and White.  If so please email me @ jvp1968@aol.com.  All her old shows were great.,1008374400,8,353,4.208955223880597
663033,5,6303364985,"As a little girl living in South Africa, Wednesday nights was very special.  That's when The Carol Burnett Show came on.  I thorougly enjoyed her shows.  Today, 32 years on, I still enjoy her timeless pieces especially the Dentist sketch.  I would like very much to obtain all her videos so that I can once again enjoy them again.",990921600,14,330,4.5423728813559325
663034,4,6303364985,"Though devoid of significant new material--the new stuff is almost exclusively the kind of audience questions that were so much a part of the original series--the gems they've managed to mine from the show's archive  are well worth the modest purchase price.
Of all the pieces, however,  none are as funny as the retrospective on the times the actors would  totally lose their composure due to their co-stars' antics.  Tim Conway, of  course, was on a mission to deliberately block his co-star's sight of the  Fourth Wall, and would deliberately come to the shows' tapings with plans  of mischief.  His ability to improvise Harvey Corman into fits of on-camera  laughter were legendary, and no better examples exist than the  ""Dentist"" and ""Firefighter"" sketches.  Still, the  greatest moments on this tape are surprisingly without Corman.  There's a  ""Mama's Family"" sketch where Conway makes up a ridiculous story  about siamese elephants, only to be one-upped by a slightly foul-mouthed  Vicki Lawrence, who finds an in-character way to make Conway and guest Dick  van Dyke fall flat onto the floor.  And, best of all, there's a simple  little ""Nazi interrogating an American POW"" scene which shows  Conway producing a surprise hand puppet of Hitler in what is a relentless  attempt to get Lyle Waggoner to break up.
Of course, this anthology has  a number of sketches and musical numbers that were completed WITHOUT a  single twitter from any actor.  But what's the fun in that?  The best thing  about _The Carol Burnett Show_ was the sense that the troupe of actors  genuinely liked each other--and would do anything to make each other's  lives on-camera a sweet misery.",956275200,95,1675,5.014598540145985
663035,4,6303364985,"I wasn't a fan of the Carol Burnett Show, and this tape contains the obligatory musical and choreography reminiscences. It also contains some of the funniest comedic sketches seen on TV, including ""The Dentist""  and ""Siamese Elephants"". Add in the Question and Answer Period  along with the other comedy routines, and you have a tape well worth adding  to your library. It lightened my day and will continue to do so.",950400000,19,417,4.845070422535211

I asked a question about the infamous DENTIST sketch.

The cast did indeed perform new sketches for the audience but sadly, they were not included on the VHS tape or aired on television. Hopefully they will be included on the DVD if it ever makes it to a DVD!",1464912000,,303,4.298245614035087

7848539,4,6303364985,"I have had this video for a while, and love watching it again and again...I just wish that this particular Reunion was available on DVD.  I have searched relentlessly, to no avail.  Does anyone know who to contact?  My home library is almost exclusively DVD, and now with the newer DVD technology, HD and the like, VHS is so dreary, such a retro format.  I know it's just a minor gripe, but if anyone knows where to get this on DVD, please post here!!! An Absolutely Wonderful Show!!!",1196640000,,484,4.465909090909091
