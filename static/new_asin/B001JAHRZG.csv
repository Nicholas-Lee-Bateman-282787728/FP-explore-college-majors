8312611,5,B001JAHRZG,"I did buy the 6-season from dvd-select. The quality was pretty good. The reason they can offer this, I beleive, is because the discs are shipped in sleeves and no cases available. It is a choice to make if you love this series as much as I  do.",1469577600,,244,4.083333333333333
8312612,5,B001JAHRZG,"I'm a big St. Elsewhere Fan. I live in Germany. I saw this show over 15 years ago on screen. I never was able to record it...
I bought season one in 2007. Since that year I'm waiting and waiting for the rest of the show to come out on DVD... Any chance that the rest will ever be released?
The show was so great. A wonderful cast, great episodes and the show deserves to be relased on DVD!!",1375747200,,390,3.949367088607595
8312613,5,B001JAHRZG,"How does this series NOT being released make any sense??  Here is a series that consistantly won a whole slew of awards.......throughout the seasons.  There are MANY customers out there who would gladly purchase the entire series. I would purchase a couple myself.  So, to whomever has the rights to this series......you are missing out on a fiancial oppoturnity as well as depriving fans.",1313798400,,389,5.046875
8312614,5,B001JAHRZG,"""St. Elsewhere"" was far ahead of its time and set the standard by which all medical dramas are done today. Each and every season is marked ""5-Stars"" by no accident.  Endearing fans STILL fondly remember these shows almost 30 years later which itself is a rarity in television.

Why have these not been released on DVD?  Some speculation is, the show had a lot of popular music as background, licensing fees alone would be expensive.  You know how the record industry is, they would expect royalities on each and every song and song clip to the point to where no producer could afford to release it. The music industry doesn't understand this concept of promotion, perhaps folks would purchase the full complete song if hearing a clip of it. Still, these are often locked up so tight the cost of the music alone would be more than the DVD's.

Another reason could be the culture of the 1980's and what was accepted as common jargon, may not be so politically correct today. Recent DVD releases of other pre-politically correct series and shows such as ""Dean Martin's Roast"", The Rat Pack, and many others and producers are beginning to understand that folks are aware of and accept this fact.",1305158400,3,1191,4.706730769230769
8312615,5,B001JAHRZG,St Elsewhere is one of my all-time favorite tv series and I would love to have all six seasons on dvd. dvdselect.tv is listed as a sponsored link on this page and offers a complete box set of all six seasons. Does anyone have any experience buying dvd's from this site?  Season 1 is the only season I am aware of that was ever released.  I would like to have the complete series but I have to question why this site offers all six seasons but only season 1 is available anywhere else.,1254614400,5,484,4.193548387096774
8312616,5,B001JAHRZG,I agree: St. Elsewhere was the best television drama that I have ever seen.  Why is it taking them so long to produce DVDs for the entire series? :(  People: please add St. Elsewhere to your notification list.,1247875200,2,209,4.473684210526316
8312617,5,B001JAHRZG,"St. Elsewhere SHOULD HAVE been licensed years ago.  Fox only released Season One, and stopped production, FOR NO REASON!  I think Shout! Factory WILL DO BETTER than Fox.  Please purchase the rights to ALL 6 SEASONS of St. Elsewhere, to any independent WHO IS REALLY WILLING!",1235952000,,274,4.913043478260869
8312618,5,B001JAHRZG,"I agree with Mr. Chivers.  There have been rumors from semi-reliable sources that a box set of the entire series will be out for Christmas 2009.  I will buy it, or I will buy sets of the individual seasons.  Surely there are enough big St. Elsewhere fans out there to justify a release of the remaining seasons.",1235001600,2,311,4.421052631578948
8312619,5,B001JAHRZG,"""St. Elsewhere"" is my all-time favourite television drama.  I could write a review for every single one of the remaining seasons not yet released to dvd, however, I will cut to the chase and suggest that the only reason I don't give each and every one any more than 5 stars is simply because the rating meter stops at 5.  The character development throughout the run of the show is sublime.  There have been many landmark episodes, but the two-part ""Time Heals"" from Season 4 would have to remain at the top of the list for Best Writing and Direction achievements; and quite possibly, it is through this storyline that ""St. Elsewhere"" could claim Best Ensemble Cast for Drama.  My favourite episodes from Season 6 are: ""Resurrection"", where (Dr. Daniel Auschlander), played by Norman Lloyd, awakens, seemingly like the phoenix rising from the ashes, and with Luther (played by Eric Laneuville) keeping a bedside vigil, claims 'The wrecking ball may have struck St. Eligius, but NOTHING can kill the man of iron'; ""Weigh In, Weigh Out"", where (Nurse Lucy), played by Jennifer Savidge, helps a dying patient to find peace in his final hours by guiding him through the Freedom Trail; ""The Naked Civil Surgeon"", where (Dr. Paulette Kiem), played by France Nuyen, helps a colleague to deal with their own integrity as a surgeon, when she likens her own skill as a gifted surgeon to the skill of her husband who is given the honour of carving the turkey at every Thanksgiving Day celebraton; and ""Their Town"", as many key character storylines from previous seasons reach such a compelling resolution esp. those of characters played by William Daniels (Dr. Mark Craig) and Bonnie Bartlett (Ellen Craig).  ""St. Elsewhere"" is a literate televisual masterpiece.  It needs to be released in its entirety because, although I have Season One on dvd, I am missing all the other vital chapters.  C'mon Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment!!!!  Please help me to fill in the missing chapters.

Edit - As of December, 2015 (a full decade since the Complete First Season made it into the waiting hands of passionate fans),  there have been no further announcements for a Complete Second Season release, or a Complete Series Collection release.  This truly is a major disappointment.

Edit - April, 2016  Whilst we celebrate 400 years of Shakespeare, I wish for the current resurgence of interest in the television medical drama (""Code Black"" - CBS; ""Chicago Med"" - NBC) to resurrect in DVD format ""St. Elsewhere"", the best ever modern day Shakespearean Tragedy made for television.",1229990400,6,2567,4.9557109557109555
