7982687,5,B00008G80X,"This was a great movie.  James Stacy is a wonderful actor and I loved him in this movie.

James Stacy is such a great actor!  He always brings a movie to life like no other actor I have ever watched.",1390262400,,199,3.925
7982688,3,B00008G80X,"Ok, so I wasn't expecting these two be the best movies in the world, and they aren't, but they are both fairly entertaining.  Hit Lady with Yvette Mimiux was fair...Heat Of Anger is a courtroom drama and I'm glad I purchased it, so I could see it and add it to my Susan Hayward DVD collection.  I would have given this set four stars, but you should know that though you can skip to another chapter, the dvd will not allow you to fast forward.  Reminds me of 8track tapes from the '70s.",1384214400,,486,4.204301075268817
7982689,5,B00008G80X,"A bit like a Jackie Collins saga Hit Lady has it all. It was released in 1974.  Romance, Mafia, and beautiful people. Yvette Mimeaux does a nice job and for once isn't a victim. She looks wonderful, and has an attractive wardrobe too. Dack Rambo makes a perfect leading man. They make a fine  couple. The twist ending is very good. This was made in the golden age of television films when writing and actors were tops.  A pilot for a television series that was never produced, Heat Of Anger is very watchable with the beautiful  Susan Hayward doing her usual fantastic work.it was released in 1972. Impossible not to watch her. The support is provided by James Stacy. They have a good chemistry together. Susan Hayward replaced Barbara Stanwyck as she was not able to film. This is one of Susan Hayward's last film's. Also made in the golden age of television films. Fans of Susan Hayward will like this the most.",1354665600,2,913,4.58282208588957
7982690,4,B00008G80X,This was a great deal because it showcases to shows about woman who are not only in charge of their own worlds but the worlds of those around them. I liked how each took control of a situation and brought it to a heart stopping ending. I would recommend this DVD to any one who likes a good action packed drama,1354492800,,310,4.098360655737705
