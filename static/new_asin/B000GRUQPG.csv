8134215,5,B000GRUQPG,"This is a great box set of individually cased DVD's.  The outer case is of art wrapped cardboard; the slim plastic individual inner cases feature unique case artwork and a brief synopsis of the episode contents. For you collectors, it looks great on the shelf.
If you're unfamiliar with this series, it's about a guy who is prodded into producing and selling his own doujinshi or ""fan comics"", much to the chagrin of an unrequited love interest, and the people he is introduced to along the way.  This is an older production and you will notice it in the artwork.  If your the kind of viewer who has the propensity to critique every detail of your anime, then you will find a lot wrong with with this show.  If you can look beyond this, the story is pretty basic but fun and easy to follow.  The characters range from the average filler to the obnoxiously outrageous with an English dub that follows in kind.  It's a fun occasional watch, not groundbreaking by any means. An average passing of time, like having a pint between meals; just kick your feet up and watch something silly.",1514419200,,1083,4.556701030927835
8134216,4,B000GRUQPG,"The Comic Party anime is loosely based on the romantic adventure and dating sim video game of the same name. The anime differs as it is about Kazuki and his friends(acquaintances) and their journey through the world of making and selling their very own doujinshi.

This story is adorable and fun to watch. It is basically Kazuki's life with few plot twists. This anime does well to show Kazuki's growth after being thrust into the world of doujinshi (fan comics) while showing how events work in Japan, but there isn't really outrageous or complex.

The art in the series is not explosive, as there are not many action scenes. It remains the same through the series.

What really stands out about this series is the characters, and that is where the focus is. Each character comes with their own personality that adds magic to the series. You can actually see the character growth throughout the series. Plus, the relationships in this series are just what you would expect to see between friends in real life.

So overall I believe this series was lovely and enjoyable. I really enjoyed not only the anime, but learning about the world of doujinshi and how they are made. I would very much recommend this series.",1331769600,,1213,4.734597156398104
8134217,5,B000GRUQPG,"Comic Party is a sweet and FUNNY way to look in the lives of young comic writers and artists.
