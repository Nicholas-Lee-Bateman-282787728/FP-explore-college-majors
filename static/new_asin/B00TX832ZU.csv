8703248,4,B00TX832ZU,Five women are nude. All have beautiful real breasts and gorgeous hair between their legs. There is at least one woman nude or wearing a see through for the entire movie. Lots of up close views of between the legs and their breasts. Only negative was the two male/female hardcore scenes. Could have done without them. This is a gem that will never be able to be made again.,1528156800,,373,4.420289855072464

8703250,4,B00TX832ZU,"This review is for the Greek packaged version of ""Doriana Grey"".

Despite the ""Die Marquise von Sade""  sub-title of this 1976 Jess Franco film - the 'concept' behind the thin story line actually belongs more to Oscar Wilde's  ""Picture of Dorian Grey"" than to any of De Sade's writings. In this fevered tale - a youthful Lina Romay plays a dual role as she portrays con-joined twin sisters who were, apparently, surgically separated at birth with some unfortunate results!  One sister has risen to become a rich independent woman - but - the initial dividing operation from her twin rendered her unable to have any sexual pleasure (bummer!).  Her twin sis suffered brain damage in the seminal surgery and has been locked away where she mostly lolls about naked on her bed  - incessantly masturbating!  The plot flips between the 2 women's lives - as the rich, sexually deprived/depraved, Doriana takes on a series of 'lovers' who all die as a result of their pairing with her - while her simple minded sibling 'Little Doriana' just can't keep her hands off her own snatch.

Franco alludes to Wilde's work via the 'mirror-like' relationship of the twin girls and their disparate personalities - but - this is essentially a sex romp and the content is VERY explicit!  Full female (and male) nudity is abundant and there are graphic scenes of fellatio and penetration featured, as well as, numerous gynecological close-ups of Ms Romay's nether regions!  The majority of the sex scenes are girl/girl with a nice sampling of Franco lovelies pairing up - but there are also a couple of hetero scenes w/ Doriana's 'mute' male servant that provide the penile factor per the aforementioned XXX content.  While the plot elements are a bit obscure - there is some intrigue to this particular Franco flik that help to raise it above many of his, typically, meandering dramas.  Regardless - it's primarily a sexual extravaganza and this film IS particularly 'hot' in that realm!

The visual quality of this Greek disk is exceptionally clean!  - Wide-Screen format - and despite all the Greek writing on the DVD packaging the film is actually dubbed in English (w/ removable Greek sub-titles).  The DVD contains numerous 'extras' (tho some are in Greek language) - and even includes an option to re-view (jump-to) the specific 'soft-core' and 'hard-core' scenes contained within the story.  The young Lina is at her peak loveliness here and she sure doesn't 'hold-back' in sharing her charms with the viewer!  All in all a very satisfying ADULT viewing experience and nice addition to the Franco collection!",1475884800,2,2592,4.935483870967742
