7120175,4,B00W4GARCO,"Don't think of this as a film about sex; think about it as a film about work. Once you look past the trappings of the dungeon, and the varieties of sexual fetishes that the clients bring in, it's about someone who has a hard, tedious job where they clock in every day to make the rent.

We've all had those jobs. I know that I have; instead of flogging, mine usually involved data entry or spreadsheets or burgers. But the power dynamic is much the same: You have a shitty boss and a tedious job and little support when it gets really bad. One of the great things about Remedy, as compared to other films about sex work, is how ordinary everything seems. She doesn't slam us with sensationalism, or play up the weirdness of the fetishes (although there are plenty; might want to consider a warning if you have a problem with dentists). In the end, it's about Remedy and her job.",1471651200,6,878,4.386503067484663
7120176,5,B00W4GARCO,"What's it like to be a dominatrix?  While the answer will vary in details, this work is so authentic it will answer your questions for real or leave you with a smarter way of asking.  It explores a particular line of sex work that, by definition, does not involve intercourse.  Of course people break rules in professional kink, play, etc.  There are so many rules.  It's an interesting world and Cheyenne Picardo's debut feature film is worth watching because she really gets her material, the shots work, and her actors are plausible.  I look forward to her future projects.",1471564800,9,576,4.767676767676767
7120177,5,B00W4GARCO,"REMEDY, Cheyenne Picardo's debut feature film, is a unique work of art and inquiry. It's an artfully constructed, psychological exploration of submission, BDSM, sex work (three subjects that are interconnected but very separate things), and the personal experience of one mysterious young woman. This story is erotic at times but it is NOT an erotic or pornographic film. It's closer to a slowly building psychological horror story or coming-of-age story. If you want to get off, maybe buy something else. If you're fascinated with the experience of being a professional submissive BDSM practitioner trying to survive in a city famous for using people and throwing them away, you'll find a lot to think about here. Kira Davies is perfectly cast in the lead role, her lines few, her eyes and face beautifully expressive.",1471564800,6,819,5.165413533834586
7120178,5,B00W4GARCO,"REMEDY by Cheyenne Picardo is amazing. It's by turns funny, scary, seductive, thrilling and thought-provoking.
It feels extremely TRUE, both in the script, words, acting and the sheer closeness of the narrative. The film follows a woman who starts working as a professional BDSM Dominatrix in New York, and describes her encounters with clients as well as her personal journey in the environment.
There is real in-depth complexity of both the characters and the rituals, and you really feel the different vibes of the different encounters. It has a sensitivity and honesty that really moves you (and scares and excites and touches and provokes.)
The visuals and storytelling kept flowing and evolving, at turns snappy and slow, montage and focused on a single feeling, energetic and intimate - quite a ride!",1471564800,5,807,5.1679389312977095

7120180,4,B00W4GARCO,"If you enjoyed 50 shades of grey you might like this. A look at different fetishes, kinda weird because not all clients were there for sexual reasons. I enjoyed this movie for what it was.",1486166400,3,188,4.4
7120181,3,B00W4GARCO,"I admit it, I like BDSM-themed films, so when this popped up on the ""suggested"" list I gave it a try.  It concerns a young woman who for reasons that are not clear (financial?) signs up at a rather low-rent BDSM ""dungeon"".
She claims experience but it's soon apparent that she has little.  There are conversations with the other ladies who work the club as well as several of her ""scenes"".  She does both ""top"" and ""bottom""  work.

Likely the most interesting part is the clients, and their various desires of her.  There's a rather long scene with an experienced dom who seems quite unsatisfied with her ""performance""....Yet asks to see her again.

And a remarkable tale by one of the ladies about her most memorable client.... A scene which goes terribly wrong.
So it's a decent ""slice of life at a BDSM dungeon"" film, but doesn't seem to draw any conclusions either.",1485561600,7,869,4.640522875816994

7120190,5,B00W4GARCO,"While a lot of these reviews debate whether or not Cheyenne Picardo's ""Remedy"" is an accurate or ""real"" depiction of an S&M ""scene,"" it's interesting to look through at the apparent gender of the reviewers.  These reviews, much like the movie, tell a story of a ""scene"" where men want to boss women around and humiliate them, and then wonder why the women aren't enjoying it.  You're not refuting her point, dudes.  You're proving it.

Remedy is the ""Clerks"" of S&M films.  I like it, but not in any of the ways I would have expected.  Open your mind to irony, sympathy, empathy, and you might like it too, as a way of understanding someone's hard life.",1483056000,5,653,4.538461538461538

7120195,2,B00W4GARCO,"In some ways a well made movie but I disliked it because of her persistently grumpy and disinterested attitude. It was never explained why she chose this type of work, and I certainly could not figure it out because she clearly had little interest in understanding the scene, her clients or her co-workers.

7120197,3,B00W4GARCO,"This is an interesting screen play and deserves to be made into an actual film.  The lead actress may be good if she were trained to act in film.  It is apparent she is untrained and makes every mistake an actor can but there is a sincerity there that might be honed into a craft.  The same can be said of the camera man, the director and the post edits.  This of course would require a fairly large budget and may never happen.  I hope someone in the industry sees this and recognizes the opportunity here.  Also, the music is atrocious and at one point breaks down to a guy with a concertina.  Unfair treatment of a good piece of writing.",1482537600,,640,4.239669421487603
7120198,5,B00W4GARCO,"Remedy's unflinching portrayal of the early experiences of a woman navigating the world of pro-domming and pro-subbing is a welcome, if sometimes jarring, wake-up call to those who see such work as inherently sexy and empowering. The cast is excellent and their chemistry shines on-screen. Director Cheyenne Picardo demonstrates expertise in her craft with a sometimes claustraphobic atmosphere and shots that linger too long for comfort but just long enough to connect audiences to the realities of her character.",1482364800,,514,5.518987341772152

7120215,4,B00W4GARCO,"I think it is the first film that I've seen that involve the topic of BDSM where it wasn't romantic, a freak show or a horror film. It really seems uncomfortably real and takes a lot of the glamour and glitter away from the one sex work that seems not to be exploited, The Dominatrix. Though the character is a switches and plays both roles for pay, too often the sense is she absolutely no control over what she is required to do or have done to her. The role is not one of the ""Lifestyle Dominant Powerful Women"" but one that services the needs of the men that are paying her for her time. Though there is no ""sex"" it's clear that she is enduring psychological humiliation and abuse than your average street walker as the roles and acts are well outside of what she enjoys or finds interesting.",1478563200,5,796,4.3133333333333335

7120218,1,B00W4GARCO,"This is one of those movies that appears to be trying to make a point.  Otherwise all the time and money put into it could have been used for something fun and/or entertaining. Instead, it's Incredibly tedious, and flat out boring. It's basically a Stanslavski exercise with an annoying soundtrack.  Maybe I'm jaded, but I'd hoped that a movie classified as a ""crime drama"" would present some type of mystery or intrigue.. This is as interesting as viewing a film of a Sunday afternoon at Great Clips Hair Salon. Even with fast-forwarding used in every banal scene, this is way too long, and ultimately, the story makes no sense.",1473379200,,629,4.761467889908257
7120219,5,B00W4GARCO,This film is intense. It may cause pain. You probably shouldn't be alone when you watch it.  You probably shouldn't be with anyone when you watch it either. But you really should watch it.,1471651200,,188,4.529411764705882
8712109,1,B00W4GARCO,"As a Dominatrix, this film infuriates me beyond belief. Where to begin? Spoilers ahead, but the film isn't worth watching so go ahead and read. I'll save you the 2 hours you'd never get back. For starters, I've never heard of a pro dungeon that doesn't provide latex/ nitrile medical gloves and I can't believe any dungeon would ever allow a client to bring his own medical supplies unless they were disposable and in the original packaging. A client brings a gross, dirty needle. Also, why would you let a new Domme with no medical play experience take a solo needle play session as her very first session? A dungeon that reckless would be shut down in weeks and the owners either in debt from law suits or imprisoned for endagerment.

Second, in the entire 2 hours of the film, I didn't hear the words ""aftercare"" used a single time. I don't know any Dommes who don't offer aftercare and any dungeon that allows providers to offer submissive services would certainly offer their workers aftercare if they don't receive it from the clients. Without aftercare, domination is just abuse. Also, they allowed her to work as a pro submissive with no training, just taking her word on it that she had experience in her personal life? I'm sorry, no dungeon would do that. Far too much danger, far too much risk.

I could go on for hours about how unrealistic this portrayal of professional dominatrixes is, but honestly, I'm exhausted just thinking about it. Go watch Black & White & Sex if you want anything resembling a realistic look at the life of a professional sex worker. The domination is hotter too.",1528934400,4,1602,4.677304964539007

It's clear she has both ethics and a personal moral code that guide her behavior, even at the expense of her work.

The film successfully steers clear of the common tropes and instead focuses on the main character, her choices,  and her experiences. In the process the film does what all art ought to do - help us empathize more than sympathize with people whose lives and worlds are different from our own - ""to walk a mile in their shoes"".

8712113,1,B00W4GARCO,"Okay, first of all, I don't get this whole gig. I guess I am just too boring an individual to appreciate sadism and masochism . I did watch Fifty Shades of Grey and I totally did not understand the fetish. I just don't get it. Men and women are so cruel to each other emotionally , in real relationships, that the necessity to actually physically beat one another seems, to me, to be awfully pointless. And I have been in a relationship that was very much TOO violent for me to withstand. I was beaten daily. Yep...there was blood. I have scars to this day.
That was 40 years ago, and I STILL don't know why I stayed. Low esteem? Yeah, p'rolly.  And believe me, there was absolutely no pleasure in that, for me. I just don't get it . And the man who was doing the beating, was a sick, unbalanced and terribly cruel individual.  I'm not going to pass judgment on the people who DO get it, and who do seem to enjoy this kind of treatment/behavior. I will just have to say, I think that the main actress in this movie definitely had some emotional and psychological problems that were not well served by her becoming a professional in this particular arena. I really did feel sorry for her. And dare I mention, that I wanted to slap the bejesus out of most of those men, and I mean NOT in a good way !  I found them all quite sickening.  And, in this I will be judgmental. I do feel very sorry for those women who honestly feel they deserve that type of treatment. Because the truth is they DON'T!",1496361600,,1494,4.25
8712114,4,B00W4GARCO,"Ascetically, this film was delicious. The bondage scenes were beautiful and sensual. The spanking scenes were hot and exciting especially when the characters were obviously into it and enjoying it. It was artfully filmed and very sexy.

As far as BDSM films go, very few them do it right: depicting consenting adults experimenting with power play and pain. This film does it rightmostly. Better than many big blockbuster films in fact. Its clear that there is negotiation, agreement, and mutually satisfactory arrangements. (Albeit there wasn't any mention of safe words, and I was disturbed when the manager of the club refused to install the baby monitors.)

I liked the film a lot but I wasn't sure why the main character was doing what she was doing. Sometimes she seemed to genuinely enjoy herself other times she seemed unhappy. Was the money that good? It didn't seem like her economic standards were raised by her career, so what else was she chasing after?  There was one client with whom she seemed to be herself, content and playful. Another client pushed her to limitsbut what seemed to be in a good way.  She was shown to be thinking about him and how he made her feel long after the encounter. It would have been nice to see those relationships continue to develop.

[spoiler warning]

Perhaps I need to re-watch the film but I wasn't sure what drove her to the edge, why she flipped out on that client in the end. Was she shaken by the intensity of the sub sessions? (Personally, I thought she needed some aftercare, that she didn't receive from either the client or her colleagues). But she also seemed entranced and excited by the sessions that pushed her limits. I couldn't draw a conclusion as to whether she was into it or not.  Was this just the typical BDSM plot where she is into it but then feels ashamed because of the weirdness and wrongness of what excites her? Or was she in over her head (another cliche overdone BDSM plot..)? The film felt inconclusive to me.  I wanted her to confront her fear or whatever she was feeling in some way. I wanted her to figure out what made her happy to keep doing it. I wanted her to develop some kind of relationship with the client that she seemed to have fun withnot necessarily romanticit seemed like she really needed a friend.

[end of spoiler]

Even with all my questions, I still recommend the film. Sexuality is complex and comes in so many more flavors than vanilla. We need more films like this to depict the huge variety of human desires faithfully and without judgment so there can less guilt and more letting go and enjoying the thrill of fantasy, no matter what titillates you.",1487980800,5,2655,4.641791044776119

It was a little different as far as the style and directing goes but I was impressed overall. If you are on into the BDSM scene or curious about it I would highly recommend this. I think it put a good spin on how the lifestyle can bring out some laughter and playfulness and not be so serious all the time.,1487635200,2,404,4.0625

8712117,5,B00W4GARCO,"I love this film.

This isn't necessarily a film that delves into deep character development or an involved plot.  What it is, is a study of the imprint of experience--some subtle, some decidedly not--on a young woman who takes on the role of a sex worker in New York City, essentially on a dare and completely unprepared.  It's not your typical spin on this subject--this is not a kink-dot-com production--and from what I've come to understand, it's a lot closer to the kinds of things that actually go on in these environments.  The BDSM sessions seem to spool out in real time, almost documentary-like, pulling the viewer along into the depths of the titular character's bizarre new work environment.  What makes this journey compelling and believable is the lead actress's ability to convey a landscape of complex and conflicting emotions through her facial expressions alone.  Her strength in this role is formidable and binds the entire tale together.

The climax comes a bit abruptly, though the film doesn't truly conclude until the closing credits have run.  Some of the performances are imperfect, and the musical interludes can linger a bit long.  But if you're looking for an emotional journey across territory not often explored honestly in this medium, this is a worthy pick.  It's a strong first effort from a very promising director.",1486598400,2,1349,5.00896860986547
