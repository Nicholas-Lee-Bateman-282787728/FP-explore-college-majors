8298737,5,B001ELTLIG,Excellent move topic.  It should be seen by all high school and college freshmen. There is truth woven through this movie that rings so very true for girls.,1493251200,,156,4.571428571428571

8298739,5,B001ELTLIG,"awesome concept, fabulous acting, great plot, fantastic movie in general.  I have watched it over and over.  Great way to look at things and life.",1382140800,,146,4.8
8298740,4,B001ELTLIG,"I enjoyed this film.  It works for a date night movie.  The story is light and entertaining.  I don't think there's a great deal of substance (there's some love story stuff), but it is an interesting story.  It beats out Sex and the City, in my opinion.  It made me laugh, which is usually a good sign.  I think it deserves watching.",1244764800,2,333,4.290322580645161
8298741,4,B001ELTLIG,"I found this to be an amusing indie film.  I'm a woman, and was hesitant at first due to the rather suggestive cover.  But once I started to watch, I could see this was a tame film with a modern day message of how women from all walks of life can stand on their own, in their own way.  I enjoyed watching Lin Shaye as a biker bar owner (I loved her in There's Something About Mary).  And Eve Plumb?!? You know, from the Brady Bunch?!  Jeremy Sisto is ever yummy.  Anyway, I found the film to be entertaining.  Popcorn movie for sure.",1244332800,3,533,4.116504854368932
8298742,1,B001ELTLIG,"The premise of a sorority house going without men for the sake of research is a good one.  The premise of introducing Jeremy Sisto as a ringer is even better.  So why does this stink?  It fails as a feminist message, as a teeny film, and as a love story.  No way would Sisto's dreamboat put up with these hicks.",1241740800,,311,4.133333333333334
8298743,1,B001ELTLIG,"There were several warning signs that this film was in trouble; It took 5 years to make it to DVD under a different name, the actor descriptions on the cover included headings under their names of ""starred along side"" and ""best actor at the Dahlenga Intl Film Fest"" and there were over 40 copies for sale here within one week for 1/2 price - but I took a chance anyway as there is always the hope that a decent sex comedy will fly under the radar.

There are two high points to this film - Jeremy Sisto and Lala Sloatman. Their characters have an interesting non-physical relationship that carries the film's only redeeming quality. The story takes place - you know what - not even worth it. The story description tells it simply here - and really there is nothing else. Not a skin fest for those that were asking - and not an intellectual film about feminism as some had advertised.

Bad overacting and tame sorority parties fill in where there was probably supposed to be meaningful college thesis learning, but they gave it a decent try with some good camerawork and that fast-forward the frames mentality of trying to make the topic look ""edgy"".

The cover art by Maverick is a sell out - none of the half-naked women on the slip are in the film, and the aforementioned actor descriptions on the back do not even show the people they are talking about - right next to pics of the four girls (actually in the film) taken years after the production. Wish there was something good to say - maybe worth the watch for Sisto. Since Sloatman has disappeared after making this, it might be one of those pieces that preserves a budding actresses' last performance.",1227484800,4,1659,4.54180602006689
