4858329,2,B005QEAOPQ,I was disappointed  with this product.  I selected it after seeing the Nina Berry interviewed  on our local TV Program on Aging. There was nothing in the exercise that would work up a good belly laugh. The Comedians on National TV do a far better job with well timed jokes. Ms Berry probably does well with a live audience.,1353024000,,323,4.440677966101695
4858330,5,B005QEAOPQ,"Nira shows the benefits of laughter to your everyday life. Even if you don't really feel like laughing, you can 'fake it to make it' and still feel the benefits of laughter yoga.
I highly recommend this video to everyone - we all need more laughter in our lives!",1346544000,3,262,4.36734693877551
4858331,5,B005QEAOPQ,"This DVD has been invaluable to me.  When I feel stressed out or just need to feel uplifted, I put it on and can't help but feel better - both the laughing and the relaxation segment have really helped me.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone - and it also makes a great gift for someone you love.  I watch it several times a week and it has made a big impact on my feeling less stressed and more able to take on life with a smile!",1346544000,4,432,3.8863636363636362
4858332,5,B005QEAOPQ,"I received a cancer diagnosis and subsequently underwent treatment for it.  During that time, I looked for ways to help myself.  I was a little familiar with laughter yoga and was looking for a DVD that would be similar to a laughter yoga class.  I had read that Nira Berry is a cancer survivor as well and decided to try this DVD.  I have used the DVD many times-- I feel like I know the people in the class :).  Especially in the early days of my diagnosis as I tried to put one foot in front of the other, I believe the laughter truly helped.",1339977600,11,545,4.10377358490566
4858333,1,B005QEAOPQ,Thought this video would be hilarious and that you would be laughing most of the time. It was not and I did not.,1336089600,,112,3.9130434782608696
4858334,5,B005QEAOPQ,"This lady can make you laugh at anything!  She makes laughter effortless.  Watching this video can perk you up in times when you're feeling sad, and energize you when you're feeling good.  Love the energy Nira brings to her audience.  I would recommend this for a blah moment or a moment when you want to be inspired to laugh.  The people in the video make me want to be part of it.",1333238400,,382,4.25
8483326,4,B005QEAOPQ,Loved it! I have taken several laughter yoga classes and love it! It is much better if you another person or persons. It enhances tne experience greatly!,1496966400,,153,4.703703703703703
8483327,5,B005QEAOPQ,"Just received the DVD, and it is great! I followed along and thoroughly enjoyed the various laughter scenarios. I felt very energized afterwards and LOVED how she led me through it. Nira Berry is full of energy and it is as contagious as the laughter. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to reduce stress and feel energized through laughter.",1490832000,2,354,4.725806451612903
8483328,5,B005QEAOPQ,"At first, I was skeptical about trying laughing yoga. However, I can easily say that purchasing this was one of the best decisions I have made! It was enjoyable to watch, and I learned a lot about the value in laughter yoga. It has effectively reduced my stress. This DVD was also very easy to follow along with.",1490054400,,312,4.396551724137931
8483329,2,B005QEAOPQ,Good idea but poorly done.  With such simple exercises we don't need to go through instructions at all!,1485993600,,103,4.722222222222222
8483330,3,B005QEAOPQ,"Nita's class is a little hokey for my taste, but it was the best deal I could get on a laughter yoga DVD to use to introduce the concept to a small group.",1465171200,,154,3.696969696969697
8483331,5,B005QEAOPQ,"I have been fortunate to have laughed with Nira in person.  This DVD is the next best thing.  I have used it to relieve chronic pain, and when I was recovering from cancer, and now use it to relieve stress.",1462752000,,206,4.125
8483332,5,B005QEAOPQ,Great stress reliever,1439164800,,21,6.333333333333333
8483333,1,B005QEAOPQ,"Waste of money. Great idea, but this teacher wasn't appealing at all.",1433894400,,69,4.833333333333333
8483334,2,B005QEAOPQ,"If you don't mind a comedy yoga routine, you may like this. Too much like a laugh track and not enough actual yoga.",1420156800,,115,4.043478260869565
8483335,3,B005QEAOPQ,It was kind of slow moving.  It had too many stops and starts in it.  The people seemed forced most of the time except for one gentleman.,1392076800,,137,4.037037037037037
