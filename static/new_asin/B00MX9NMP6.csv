8675235,5,B00MX9NMP6,"'Superb' production, beautifully photographed and presented, about how Californians have altered their state's natural environment to accommodate their desires, needs for work, living space, and recreation.  And, how that alteration is going to have calamitous results in the future if citizens don't change their attitude and behavior right now to start protecting and reclaiming natural areas if that beauty and quality of life peculiar to California is to be maintained. Subjects addressed:  citizen's adjusting their home's landscaping to mirror Californias native natural habitat, non-native plant-life, farming, water, forests, population, San Andreas Fault, coastal, ocean, etc. This idea should pertain to every U.S. state's type of [native] natural environments.",1457136000,3,771,6.12962962962963

8675240,5,B00MX9NMP6,"This is a ""must see"" documentary for anyone interested in the environmental crises of California.  The DVD combines beautiful footage of the major natural areas of California, interviews with prominent geographers and environmental scientists who know the state well, and instances of projects to undo the damage resulting from the mindless projects to exploit the land and waterscape over the years.  So it leaves the viewer with hope.  Even the well informed will probably learn something from this well-made film, which drew from the expertise of dozens of both professionals and dedicated volunteers.  It would also be a good choice as a film in an environmental science course, on the college or advanced high-school level.  The price makes ""Becoming California"" a bargain.  It's truly deserving of a 5-star recommendation!",1411689600,8,828,5.37984496124031
