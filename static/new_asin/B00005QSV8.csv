A movie worth having and watching again and again from time to time. The lack of English subtitles kills it here, though, cause as much as my French can be in considerable shape, the best lines require a very good French for total understanding.",1371859200,2,413,4.594594594594595
7950808,5,B00005QSV8,"A movie I rented on several ocassions from Alliance Francaise, I finally purchased the movie. A comedy which takes place in the french village by the french Alps, scenery is spectacular, actors great, the plot is a crime, and a judicial case by French court, and a civil napoleonic court setting, great movie, I don't have to rent it anymore..",1317686400,,343,4.733333333333333
7950809,4,B00005QSV8,"This is a film made for Jacques Villeret, it suits perfectly the roles we expect of him. As funny as ""Le diner des cons"", but in here, he's the protagonist, the chief, the man of town.

For the ones who don't know him yet, he is the image of subjugation. Fat, round, looking like simplicity incarnate, he is nevertheless able to throw some convincing blows. Like in the trial, or to his superb lawyer, when he ventures: ""you are not better than me. You're even worse..."".

Again a stellar cast. The one I mostly liked is Suzanne Flon as ""La matresse"". A small but pivotal character, she's probably the only one he really cares about, her approval, his goats and stamps collections (!) are what makes him tickle.

Like in many other instances, the province ways mean completely differently than what us urbanites understand by the words. At a moment it's even funny, the judges don't understand what the bar owner is even speaking about.

Like in many films of the genre, one could be left to wonder why are we ""siding for"" a murderer, but, alas, we do. The first half is perfect. The trial has a bit of a farcical/ hystrionic side verging on the excess. On a ""pleonasm"" like the lovable maitresse would quip to l' avocat Miramont. Again in a ""devil's advocate"" role, like his better ""Galile"". He's a good comedian, but I'm afraid Guitry's plot makes him overact a little.

Roland Magdane is Le patron du caf, very believable if you know the (psychological) type. Nice accent :). Magali is fine as an ""allumeuse"". Dominique Lavanant from ""Soeur Therese.com"" among others is a funny ""Mme Goutilleux, la pharmacienne"" who corrects everybody, even the judge :).

A film that could hardly be improved deserves no further words.",1236988800,,1722,4.704318936877076
