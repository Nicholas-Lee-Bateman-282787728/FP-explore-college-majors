8290335,2,B000BO9I12,there are some decent workout routines in this book but the instructor barely takes the time to go over anything with you like most dvd's do. At some points you feel like Its pretty much just him  doing his own workout at a gym and a hidden camera just happens to be there.  Your better off just going to a gym and copying some random persons workout that you see. I personally recommend p90x or beachbody insanity for a full and complete workout routine.,1270339200,,455,4.404761904761905

Great lighting and great circuit routine, motivation for kick-boxers out there.",1203811200,,246,4.568181818181818
8290337,5,B000BO9I12,This was the perfect way to figure out how to add to my routine.  Julien has a great body and it definitely helped my motivation.,1158192000,2,129,4.16
