8651219,4,B00JJBAA56,"I was transfixed in a Mexico City Gallery by his ""Man on Fire"" painting . I spent 20 minutes just looking at the painting. Then I asked the gallery owner how much would that cost. He said $8000.. If I had $8000 in my pocket I would not have trusted myself and I would've bought it. If I did I would be a multimillionaire. I am glad there is a DVD available about this great painter,
