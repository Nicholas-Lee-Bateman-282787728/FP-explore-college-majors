8562209,5,B000A2X906,"If you are interested in the origins of our Christmas and Yule celebrations, this video is for you. This documentary-style film provides a balanced survey of both the Christian and pagan roots of our traditions, and follows the variable cultural influences that have shaped them along the way. I rented the movie last year, and decided to purchase a copy for each of my sisters for Christmas this year. I would recommend this for anyone who experiences nostalgic-longing for celebrations that have heart and home at their centre.",1289779200,,529,5.0227272727272725
