7836807,5,6303091636,"In this film Ollie's wife is enraged at Ollie because she believes Ollie spends more time with Stan instead of with her.  When Stan is told this by Ollie Stan once again gives Ollie dumb advice, Stan tells Ollie he should adopt a baby so Arabella will be busy with the baby and will have no time to complain.  Ollie listened to Stan and to his surprise when he came home a process server played by Bille Gilbert served divorce papers on Ollie and a subpoena on stan.  The process server said to Ollie that his wife is suing him for divorce and it is all because of Stan.  When the process server served Stan he said"" She'll have you by hook,line and sinker"".  Now the boys are stuck as the baby's new parents and can't even get a decent night's sleep.  Once again Stan got Ollie in another fine mess.",1420934400,,800,4.264900662251655
7836808,3,6303091636,"An above-average Laurel and Hardy short feature, this two reel affair is directed by George Marshall (later at the helm of many top-flight comedy features) and is marked, specially so during its initial two-thirds, by a greater emphasis upon character development than upon physical humour, to the work's advantage.  After Oliver and his wife Arabella (Laurel/Hardy regular Mae Busch) have a violent spat due to his expenditure of a majority of his free time with Stan, the latter suggests that Ollie adopt a baby with which to occupy Arabella's hours, freeing the two pals to enjoy themselves, and Ollie immediately does so (following an optical wipe), but too late because a process server (Billy Gilbert) presents him with divorce papers along with a similar document to Laurel for ""alienation of Mr. Hardy's affections.""  This leads to one of the better developed scenes from the duo's films wherein Ollie pastiches the Abandoned Maiden genre after his buddy tries to leave him alone to care for his new infant, a very funny and original piece of cinematic business that, in addition to a poignant scene when the men revert to boyhood while lolling atop Stanley's bed in his adjacent apartment, make of this a better than standard effort of Laurel and Hardy.",1125360000,,1262,5.004761904761905
