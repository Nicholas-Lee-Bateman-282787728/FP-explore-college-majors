I'm a huge fan for Sarah michelle Gellar, I like have every movie and tv show with her and I've been trying to find a different version of this movie and they were all sold out, so before I buy this I would like to know if it can talk in English Thank you!!!",1313712000,,319,3.7761194029850746

6200788,1,B003TLM14U,"This movie is basic glurge - a feel good, ""magical"" healing that in no way reflects the realities of suicide, suicidal ideation or mental illness.  It's a fantasy created by someone who knows little to nothing of the subject matter.  As someone who has worked in suicide intervention, suicide prevention and with the mentally ill and disenfranchised for over 11 years, this movie is really offensive and gives the wrong idea about mental health.  It's a basic, sweet pabulum and really dishonors the journeys and struggles of those who live with mental illness.",1472774400,5,561,5.010752688172043

6200792,4,B003TLM14U,"I just watched this film and am about to rewatch the beginning, so one can probably imagine that I did quite like it!
I was just looking for something to have on for noise in the middle of the night, did not have high expectations, even as such a huge fan of Sarah's, and ended up entranced. I stopped what I was doing and just watched.
Reviews that give away story are no fun, so I will say first that this is a wonderful, strong cast. Beautifully cast, wonderful actors. It was also ust beautiful to look at, especially the outside of a building where Veronika spends some time. One of those places you want to find and go there, take photos.

I really hope this will lead to more really good films for Sarah - I was sure this would make me want my hour and a half back, like ""Harvard Man (or whatever it was called!), but as previously mentioned, I am going to rewatch the beginning. I recommend this to everyone, really, if you are a fan of Melissa Leo or Erika Christensen (sorry, not sure how to sell her name), who both  just elegantly become their characters, or if you have been an ""SMG"" fan since All My Childen or that TV show no one watched (kidding! I have every BtVS ep memorized), you will not be disappointed in her performance. I think this might be her best role yet. Absolutely worth your time!",1465862400,,1313,4.290322580645161

6200795,2,B003TLM14U,"I was really not a fan of this one. It was a disappointing plot to me - the message at the end was great, but it seemed like a lot of irrelevant happenings that made up the movie. The plot in its entirety just did not gel together for me.",1452124800,,238,3.78

6200798,3,B003TLM14U,"This movie is a straightforward telling of Paulo Coelho's book of the same name and stars Sarah Michelle Gellar in her Buffy heyday.  I waited almost a decade to see it as it wasn't shown or distributed in the US since I'm a fan of both.  The book is good but didn't knock my socks off and the film follows suit despite Gellar's determined performance.  The director made a workmanlike job of it and stuck loyally to Coelho's story but simply didn't have the license, the vision, or skill to make it pop and fizz.  Still, it's tons better than Lost in Translation.",1442966400,2,564,4.446601941747573

gave this short film 5 stars. Dale Haufrect",1429833600,,940,5.358108108108108

6200814,5,B003TLM14U,"I didn't expect to like this movie, let alone completely enjoy it.  Found by accident, I really liked the acting and writing.  If you don't stay until the very last moments, you miss the entire point of the film.  However, there are several sub-points that I found thought-provoking as well.",1428019200,6,291,4.78
6200815,5,B003TLM14U,"I have to say i really enjoyed this movie and I don't normally watch these types of movies. It might be a little predictable; however, it is well worth your time, at least in my opinion anyway.",1427846400,,193,4.243243243243243

6200817,3,B003TLM14U,"Dont confuse insanity with the loss of control. Veronika (Geller) is tired of living and decides to die. She takes a cocktail of alcohol and pills. When she wakes up in the hospital she is told that even though she didn't die she damaged her heart to the point of where she could still die anytime. Faced with having to wait longer in an institution she thinks this is worse. She begins to have an effect on other residents there and realizes things aren't as bad as she thought. This is a movie that starts off strong, drags a little in the middle but the ending is perfect and that is really what makes the movie. I don't want to give anything away, but if you start to get bored stick with the movie, you will not regret it. Geller is very good in this, and while the movie deals with suicide it never feels overly melodramatic or cheesy. It had tinges of Girl, Interrupted which I liked. This probably won't win any awards or be considered a classic but it is well worth your time and money. Overall, an OK movie with a perfect ending. I give it a B.",1426464000,7,1054,4.248756218905473
6200818,2,B003TLM14U,"I love indies.  I have a fairly high tolerance for slow and boring.  However, combine slow and boring with mumbled, inarticulate dialogue, and throw in an ill-conceived plot, and you've got a recipe for this congealed mess of a film.

6200821,2,B003TLM14U,"Very blah.  Feels like a story that could have been much better, but just isn't.  I agree with other reviewers--you really only need to watch the last 30 min. to get the story.  Or better yet, read the book.or take the dog for a walk.or do your laundry.all better uses of your time.",1424476800,,282,4.283018867924528

6200825,2,B003TLM14U,"Slow and boring and pointless and predictable-tries to commit suicide only to live through it and come to find, she is not healthy and has little time to live. Duh, what happens? oh, she finds an appreciation and passion for life now. In the end, it was the wrong chart and she is not even ill or dying.. None of the characters gets developed enough to get to care about them. Yawn..",1423094400,2,383,4.333333333333333
6200826,2,B003TLM14U,"This movie was a huge disappointment. I haven't read the book but had read synopses of the film, and I've also read The Alchemist by Coelho. I had high hopes for some gritty conversations and existential philosophy--or at least some kind of fable. Instead, like just about every movie, this one proposes that the only thing worth living for is romance. I suppose if a woman is too fat or ugly to attract a hot, depressed guy who will understand her and simultaneously find his desire to live, she might as well go ahead and keep taking pills until she succeeds. At the end, poor Veronika falls into the very trap that she describes so accurately at the beginning of the film. And the ""twist"" ending was evident to me from the moment Veronika wakes up after her suicide attempt and is given a prognosis.

I went into the movie looking for a story that would finally deal honestly with depression and offer some realism or a spiritual outlook. It's really just a bunch of s***.

P.S. Apparently, having the urge to masturbate equals falling in love! Now you know!",1422576000,11,1061,4.578947368421052

Of course the book was better but so what.  Anytime you have a surprise ending, that usually gets my vote and I've always loved my Buffy!  Good movie.",1421971200,10,313,4.2
6200829,5,B003TLM14U,"I discovered Sarah Michelle Gellar thanks to Buffy The Vampire Slayer and I am a  big fan. I have been tracking down her movies to see how she is as an actress and have found some real gems and I'm even more impressed with her. I actually found Veronika Decides to Die on IMDB and it looked pretty intriguing so I ordered it from Amazon. This is an excellent movie and Veronika is in my opinion the best dramatic role that Sarah has ever done, she is totally awesome! From the title it's apparent that Veronika has decided to kill herself, the real story is what happens after she fails. A great supporting cast and a well written story. Cap all of this with a totally awesome soundtrack and it's a winner. This movie has never been released theatrically in the US only overseas where it was a big hit and that's a real shame. It was just released in the states last year on Amazon and I'm glad I tracked it down, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. I just wish it was available more widely!
