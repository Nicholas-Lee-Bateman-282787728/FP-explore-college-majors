1054810,5,6305610436,"This is a wonderful collection of his performances. Unlike the CREAM documentery, this is all music. With his many styles and variations, this is a little of all of them. Although it is not 5.1 stereo, if this is set up to your ears liking, you will totally enjoy this DVD. I particularly like PRETENDING and MY FATHERS EYES.",1116460800,3,325,4.52542372881356
1054811,4,6305610436,"I gave the DVD a 4 Star rating due to Eric Clapton the artist.  Unlike other reviewers who felt that nothing he's done since the 60's is worth listening to; I LOVED the music.  Although I don't believe ""Clapton is God"", I have enjoyed Clapton's music through the years.  I really enjoyed the videos and the guest appearances by other great musicians such as Phil Collins.
The issue is for such a great Guitar Virtuoso, Clapton didn't review the sound quality before releasing the DVD. Great DVD for Clapton fans!  However, once again the accountants put out the ""Best of"" DVD without listening to the sound.  When do they remove accountants souls; the last year prior to taking the CPA exam?",1045267200,4,691,4.677685950413223
1054812,2,6305610436,"Of all the artists with documentaries and video compilations, Eric Clapton continues to get the short end of the stick.  This chintzy collection of common videos is both a waste of your time as well as money.
With piles of fine `80's-`90's live video to use, Warner Video decided to just go cheap and slot in some best-of-Warners clips; they couldn't have spent more than the playing time compiling this.  There is nothing here that's worth spending a nickel on, especially for fans who already have ""24 Nights"" or ""Unplugged"".
Polygram did a far nicer job - and their's was nothing terrific, mind you - with their ""Cream Of Clapton"" that at least showed some aspect of the history of this performer.  This is hardly the ""best of"" 1981-1999, it's no more than VH1 might do with a handful of videos and a half-hour to kill.
A wasted opportunity - don't make things worse by wasting your hard-earned money.",1006128000,25,904,4.672955974842767
1054813,4,6305610436,"How i forgot the projects Eric has done over the years. This video really brought back some great moments, and if your a true Clapton fan or just enjoy his music, then you won't be disappointed. Eric has had his up and  downs, but through it all he always provides the listener with great  performances.",947980800,3,303,4.490909090909091
1054814,5,6305610436,"Starting off with ""Forever Man,"" probably the worst video on the tape, then, to ""Pretending"", a great, wet video with plenty of good guitar, fallowed by ""Bad Love"" which gives ""Forever  Man"" a run for it's money in ""bad videos.""  Up next is one  of Clapton's most romantic songs, ""Wonderful Tonight."" This is a  great, slow version of the song. Then it's ""Tears in Heaven,""  another song flaunting Clapton's incredible lyrical power. The video itself  is a good one... similer to the ""Unplugged"" video. Next is  ""Layla"" and ""Running on Faith."" Both great, and off of  the ""Unplugged"" video. ""Mottherless Child"" has to be  one of the best video's on the tape; in a goldish black-and-white. The song  of course is awesome too! Then is Clapton's ""Change the World.""  His Grammy-winning song, with a good, solid video to back it up. Then is  ""My Father's Eyes."" The video isn't the greatest, but the lyrics  and the voice make up for it all. Up next is ""Pilgrim,"" that has  a good video. The only problem with it, is that it's pretty long. And last,  but sure not least, is ""Blue Eyes Blue."" off of the ""Runaway  Bride"" soundtrack... although you could never tell. All of the movie  scenes were cut out of it. Nevertheless, a good video, and a good song. If  you like Clapton, like music vidoes, and like a good time: Buy this!",944265600,20,1323,4.581196581196581

7892435,5,6305610436,"Well, I have to admit that although I was familiar with some of Clapton's top hits over the years, I never thought much about him.  For some reason I am now thoroughly enamored by his music.  I bought my second CD of this because the first one apparently got worn out. I noticed the second one I received had one additional song, so I am even happer with it.  Last night I watched the DVD version.  I have to admit that some of the videos were pretty awful (this was done in 1999), but I just ignored that and listened to his amazing voice.  I am not a big blues fan, so I probably am more in love with his more popular stuff, which might not make me a real fan, but all I know is that I can listen to this CD constantly and not get tired of it.",1372291200,,745,3.94
7892436,4,6305610436,"Great music videos for a great price.  I love music videos so I can see the musicians, their instruments and how they are playing great songs.  I play my guitar with them and learn in the process.  I wish there were more music videos of the greats like Clapton.",1372204800,,261,4.285714285714286
7892437,5,6305610436,"This collection of Eric Clapton songs is a perfect collaboration of Eric and his various other bands throughout his career, and is truly a must have for all of his fans. I am an avid Eric Clapton fan who owns all of his recordings, but this is the one I listen to the most as it covers most of his career with the best of his best!",1228003200,,331,3.955223880597015
7892438,4,6305610436,"One DVD would not (does not) contain Clapton's best.  This one comes close.  I bought this as an intro to Clapton for my wife.  Price is right and she became enamored with him.  Call it a ""Starter Clapton"", not the ultimate Clapton.  For that go to the Live Clapton DVD's.",1162598400,3,272,4.36
