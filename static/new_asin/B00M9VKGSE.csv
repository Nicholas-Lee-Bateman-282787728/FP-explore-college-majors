6565250,4,B00M9VKGSE,"It's not outside the realm of possibility that I've finally gone nuts, but I swear the soundtrack on the first b & w short, involving animated dolls, sounded like it had been mastered by a dog high on nitrous oxide.  First there was an annoying whistle or similar steady tone that could be heard over the music.  After many minutes of this even the music, which had been fine, started skipping and repeating like a broken 78 you're trying to play on Grandpa's victrola in the garage.  Then the music seemed to stop, and...well, you get the idea.

Is there intelligent life out there that has experienced this?",1412553600,2,609,4.611111111111111
6565251,5,B00M9VKGSE,"I pre-ordered this set way back in November and it's definitely worth the wait. Video and audio quality inevitably varies however for all of the featured cartoons, this is the best version currently available on home video. Highlights include the trio of Ted Eshbaugh cartoons, unseen in this kind of quality (and color!) in decades, and the razor-sharp nitrate prints of ""A Swiss Trick"" and ""Playing with Fire"".

Note: There's some discrepancy with the release years provided on the case with the ones listed in the booklet as well as the disc menu. The years provided below corresponds to the years listed on the disc menu.

Note 2: Those who pre-ordered in November also received a bonus BD-R of ""Films that didn't make it on the set"" featuring 7 additional cartoons in HD. Hopefully, they will reappear on an official Thunderbean blu-ray in the near future.

6565254,5,B00M9VKGSE,"This is edited from my review on my Wizard of Oz-centric blog...

The set has two discs: the featured cartoons (including Oz) are both on Blu-Ray and DVD, as well as some bonus features. (I haven't looked these over thoroughly, but there don't appear to be any Oz-specific features.) The DVD also includes additional cartoons in good to rather rough shape.

The title is very well earned. All of these cartoons date from 1917 to 1947, a very different time in cartoon animation. Without strict regulations, animators let their imaginations go wild, and in such an experimental time, you can see many styles develop. Thus, you have beautiful cartoons such as ""Mendelssohn's Spring Song,"" to some with disturbing undertones, such as ""The Magic Mummy."" Some of the DVD-exclusive cartoons get quite disturbing, such as a Mutt and Jeff cartoon featuring a long line of stray cats and dogs being caught and fed to a sausage grinder.

Oz is not the only (Ted) Eshbaugh short on the set. Two other cartoons by him""The Snowman"" and ""Tea Pot Town""appear. ""The Snowman"" I had seen before in black and white, but here it appears, restored in two-strip Technicolor. (In fact, when Sam and I discussed Oz on the podcast, I mentioned the cartoon as another example of Eshbaugh's work.) Both are a little disturbing: a happy Eskimo boy and his friends build a snowman, only for it to come to life and terrorize them. Tea pots go out into the world to battle the ""Droops,"" which are little gloomy men who are vaporized by the tea pots' steam.

The presentation on all the cartoons is excellent. Using Blu-Ray's resolution of 1080p, the entire frame of each cartoon is presented so every detail can be seen and appreciated. Each cartoon looks sharp, and you feel sure that any color inaccuracies you see are due to the source, not the transfer. In addition, the sound is very clearly restored as well. Dorothy's cries for Toto sounded so out of place on Warner's presentation, but now they sound much better. The music is very clear as well. You might even find yourself singing, ""Hail to the Wizard of Oz! To the Wizard of Oz! He'll lead the way!"" And don't worry. The DVD offers you the same thing, just with a smaller picture size. The Blu-Ray will show you the original photography's texture, giving you a real feel of how these were originally presented.

There is one of the Disney Alice Comedies, featuring a live action Alice in an animated environment. She doesn't feature heavily in this one, but her feline friend has to deal with a rat infestation! And a longtime favorite of mine, ""Raggedy Ann in the Enchanted Square,"" is the final cartoon on the set. A sweet little cartoon, a policeman gives a thrown away Raggedy Ann doll to a blind girl named Billie, which inspires her to see her neighborhood with her heart and use her imagination to turn it from a city block into a metropolitan fairyland. I shamelessly sang along with the song ""You Can See With Your Heart"" as I watched.

The 1933 Wizard of Oz cartoon ... has three ... distinctions: it is the first animated adaption of Oz, the earliest existing color Oz film, and the first complete existing Oz film with sound. And ... it had a motif that later appeared in the MGM film. ... (It) looks even better than ever on this Blu-Ray/DVD set.

(I gave a lengthy plot description in my blog, but I'll cut it short: Dorothy and Toto are whipped to a Technicolor Land of Oz from a monochrome Kansas, where they meet the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, who join them to the Emerald City, where they are greeted with a parade before seeing the Wizard work some magic!)

So, should you put down the $18 + shipping for this set? I already have, but the fact is clear that the Oz cartoon is one of many featured cartoons on this set, so Oz fans who aren't too interested might be giving this a pass. Diehard Oz fans will snatch it up just for the Oz content alone, while Oz fans who also enjoy classic animation will find the set a treat.

8670975,5,B00M9VKGSE,Excellent Blu-ray disc of some rare classic cartoons.  I remember many of them when I was a child.  Quality of the prints are amazing.  Would buy from this company that had produced this disc again.,1505952000,,198,4.6
8670976,4,B00M9VKGSE,"This blu-ray disc features an interesting assortment of cartoons from the 1910s through the early 1950s (if you count the bonus material). Most are from the 1930s, and there are some real gems here. ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1932), ""The Snowman"" (1931), ""Tea Pot Town"" (1935), and ""To Spring"" (1936) are Technicolor eye-candy, breathtaking in their vivid colors and quite creative and entertaining as well. Others, like ""The Magic Mummy"" (1933) and ""The Bandmaster"" (1931) feature some terrific music. However, not everything is of such high caliber. ""Dolly Doings"" (1917) though possibly amusing as a novelty a century ago, is clumsy stop-motion animation, and it isn't terribly interesting. To make matters worse, the soundtrack for ""Dolly Doings"" (seemingly dubbed from a commercial 78 rpm record) has an excruciatingly loud high-pitched whistle that makes watching it with the sound on intolerable (even at low volume). I had to mute it. Since the original film would have been silent, why not use another record or commission a new piano score? Fortunately, it's less than five minutes long, so it's soon over.

For the price of the disc (around twenty dollars), I was mildly disappointed by the running time -- only a bit over 90 minutes including all ""bonus"" material. I would have hoped for at least two hours of material. Having said that, the image quality is excellent. After years of seeing early cartoons like these on bargain-bin VHS tapes or on fuzzy YouTube postings, It's a real treat to see these in pristine HD transfers. This was my first Thunderbean disc, but I'll be looking to pick up some more.",1500163200,,1612,4.992565055762082
8670977,5,B00M9VKGSE,"The first blu ray from Thunderbean Animation. What a treasure trove! This is the best introduction to rare and original animation I can think of. Talk about ORIGINALITY!

8670978,5,B00M9VKGSE,"The cartoons on this disc look simply amazing! It's worth the price for the classic cartoon To Spring in its amazing Technicolor glory. It would look fantastic on a large screen television. Thunderbean did an amazing job restoring these classics; I've been used to seeing older cartoons in poor shape, thanks to public domain DVDs. That's certainly not the case here. The Wizard of Oz from 1933 is a revelation compared to how it appears on The Wizard of Oz film DVDs.

From showcasing early examples of animation to the stellar closing cartoon featuring Raggedy Ann, this is a fantastic collection for those who want to dig a little deeper into animation history than just Disney and Warner Brothers. The quality of the transfers truly make this an outstanding release, and here's hoping for more!",1483920000,,798,4.911111111111111

8670982,5,B00M9VKGSE,"BUY THIS! If you have ANY interest in animation whatsoever and you have a big screen tv with a blu ray player, YOU NEED THIS! I made the big mistake of thinking that ALL of the dvds  and Blu Rays out there are just going to be the same ole blurry/mushy public domain stock like all the others. Well, PLEASE do not make that mistake. There is this wonderful man named Steve Stanchfield that owns this company and has been restoring the best animation besides WB Golden Collection. We are talking out of his OWN POCKET! Yes, he has been collecting and trading and searching the world over for prints, negs, 16, 35 and everything else in order to scan these Van Beruen, Fleischer, Bray, you name it, in HD! Then he removes damage, color corrects, grades, fixes sound issues, and puts cartoons that are WAY MORE important than whats seen on adult swim theses days into High Definition! Let me tell you something, when you turn off the lights, sit back, and To Spring BLASTS OFF THE SCREEN it will make you cry. Yes, the work Steve has put into this and other releases is truly an outstanding achievement in archival restoration. The Snowman is incredible in HD. You still get that beautiful film grain, NO Digital Noise Removal here to ruin the color definition! Get this, NOW! If saving the great animation of the early 1900s is important to you and your friends, please help Steve do this by purchasing his wonderful products.",1427932800,15,1424,4.584313725490196
8670983,5,B00M9VKGSE,"I have been wanting to see ""TO SPRING"" on blu-ray since they invented the blu-ray. This new transfer looks absolutely amazing. One tiny complaint is the contrast seems high in the 'above ground' scenes. Features on the cloud man are difficult to make out.

Other than that, everything was great and the cover art for this DVD is awesome! Also, ""The Little Dutch Mill"" looks FANTASTIC. Really hope to see more Fleischer Color Classics!

I will be buying every single Thunderbean release from now until I am dead.",1427932800,5,511,4.795454545454546
