8123255,4,B000FIHN70,"After reading the last review, I just have to say that is was far far too critical on what is obviously meant to be a fun, and modernized version of an old saga. It was never meant to be a historical account of Leif Ericson. It has modern references, and any movie that has a duck rescuing its main characters is clearly not taking itself too seriously. The animation is simple, yes, but the characters are colorful, and the parts are WELL ACTED. I'd show this fun dvd to my kids as often as they wanted to watch it!",1280793600,4,516,4.222222222222222
8123256,1,B000FIHN70,"I was very dissapointed in this movie.  I purchased the dvd to supplement a literature-based curriculum for prek-1st graders.  There is not a lot of age-appropriate info on Leif Ericsson out there for that age group.  I expect, as with any movie, that the story would vary from historical content...but this was ridiculous.  The characters were offensive (the behaviour of the wifes and children in disobedience and disrespect)...  I fully realize that these Vikings were not Christian (though some did convert eventually) but I find it extremely difficult to imagine that the women and children in that society would have behaved in such a fashion.  Also there were ""magic"" pendants and talking wolves and all sorts of things to add some kind of black-magic twist.  Again...the Vikings did believe in Ruins and had many ""gods"" but the nonsense in the movie carried things too far away from the historical message.  The animation was not that great a quality either.  I regret this purchase.  I will probably throw the movie out...I don't even believe it is worth donating to our public library system.  It is that poor in historical content and that vile in black-magic/superstition.  too bad!",1249430400,3,1194,5.035714285714286
