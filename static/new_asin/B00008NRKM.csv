7985739,5,B00008NRKM,"I recently purchased the piano course and already my musical abilities have really taken off.  Before I was having
trouble playing chords with my right hand  but thanks to this course I am starting to sound like a real
piano player. I am only on page 14 but I have no trouble at all  playing with both my left and right hand at the same time. I recommend this course for anyone who needs a booster shot for their musical ability.",1378771200,,429,4.271604938271605
7985740,5,B00008NRKM,"There seems to be some confusion with 2 products with the same name. I purchased Play Piano Today download bundle. It's the David Sprunger one & i think it is excellent. I have been taking piano lessons for over a year & have a pile of books on music theory, yet despite all of this i still can't play. Within 2 hours of watching David'd DVDs, i was playing. I did skip the chord theory as i already knew this. I watched the keyboard pattern DVDs & the Tension & release DVD's & that was enough to get me playing. I still have loads more of the DVDs to watch. I only bought them yesterday. Piano teachers charge a fortune for hourly tuition & it takes forever. This is designed to get you playing quickly. I obviously have the advantage of all the studying i'd done previously but as i just said 'This got me playing' I wish i'd bought the bundle years ago.",1377734400,3,857,4.2317073170731705
7985741,4,B00008NRKM,I got this  in a speedy amount of time and it played without any problems it was worth the try,1372550400,,94,3.7
7985742,1,B00008NRKM,"I have purchased this product but can not get it shipped.  I used the playpianotoday.com website and have not yet gotten a person to respond to my questions or calls from where I had to go to my Discover payment to obtain a phone number.

It may be a good course, but it looks like my $46.95 has been kissed goodbye as a scam.",1367107200,,326,4.078125
7985743,4,B00008NRKM,"My name is David Sprunger. This book and dvd set titled ""Play Piano Today"" shares the same name as our website. Unfortunately, this has created a bit of confusion because the reviews on this page might seem to reflect reviews for our website and/or lessons. They do not. Our piano lessons course is not on Amazon at this time.

The publisher of the book and dvd set on this review page is ""Hal Leonard"". Just to be clear, I enthusiastically endorse Hal Leonard's products. As a local teacher with over 60 students, I have used many of their curriculum methods and am impressed by their depth of teaching.",1365552000,12,604,4.592592592592593
7985744,1,B00008NRKM,"Robert Cooper hit the nail on the head in his comment: ""Not taught very well. Here is why: the instructor explains a concept then plays it on the piano, but when he does the video shot you see shows him playing the piano with his fingers covering up the keys so that you can't see what keys he is playing; so you can't determine what you should be doing.""

The instructor consistently teaches, then goes into full blown concert mode in his recaps with runs and hundreds of tricks not included in the lesson. He claims that he does this to 'wet your appetite' for the learning to come (as if spending your money shouldn't be enough to wet your appetite).  It's ridiculous.  Also, the product is crammed with far too much advertising, prodding the user to buy the complete set, throughout the complete set even when you've already purchased.  The showy trick-filled intros at the beginning of each section are excruciating about the 100th time you've listened to them.  No way to bypass the intro or skip his outlandish promotions.

The instructor is apparently INTENTIONALLY masking the 'finished product' of whatever it is he's claiming to teach as he has no true demo throughout the product that is usable to the learner in his ""catch-me-if-you-can"" video demonstrations of the content he's just covered.

This product has some good theory information, but as far as ""playing today"", the videos containing the indulgent stunts of the instructor will absolutely MADDEN you.

His money is already made by the time you figure out the whole set is presented this way.",1363478400,7,1564,4.809701492537314
7985745,2,B00008NRKM,"Not taught very well.  Here is why: the instructor explains a concept then plays it on the piano, but when he does the video shot you see shows him playing the piano with his fingers covering up the keys so that you can't see what keys he is playing; so you can't determine what you should be doing.  He DVD, Learning piano with Pete Sears shows you graphics of what keys are being struck, but Sears' DVD has the problem that it is not a beginners level DVD- it is intermediate level.  The Leonard DVDs no attempt to teach you how to read music, concepts are covered too fast and the viewer has a hard time following it due to the cursory coverage of each concept.  You can get some concept of what topics are covered by the following chapter index of the DVD: The basics, the right hand, the left hand, rests and the grand staff, musical intervals, the C major chord, notes A and B, eighth notes, G position, the major scale, black keys and new chords, Notes D and E,  More new notes, Key signatures, the Grand finale.",1294876800,6,1019,4.31413612565445

7985747,3,B00008NRKM,"instruction goes too fast, and a little too advance for ""real"" beginners. i think it will be useful after getting other beginner lessons first.",1257292800,5,143,5.0
