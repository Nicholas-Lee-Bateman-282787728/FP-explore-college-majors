6819660,2,B00PQRJ7PQ,"The film opens in 1988 in the Wakhan corridor, Afghanistan. Daphne (Lisa Kay) works for a war lord and gets into trouble and leaves. Mina (Sofia Black-D'Elia) is her moody daughter at Oxford. Before long bad guys invade their home (early plot spoiler) kill her parents and she ends up talking to MI6. Mina is now being moved around to avoid assassins and gets some self defense training. About an hour into the film, it takes an interesting twist, but the film dragged even during the good scenes. Sofia Black-D'Elia was not strong enough an actress to carry the lead role, one that wasn't well written to begin with.

This is an action film that feels like a drama. Rental only.

6819663,1,B00PQRJ7PQ,"The acting in this movie was soooo bad. The female lead was just awful (cute but she can't act). The male lead was the only decent actor in the entire movie but unfortunately, he couldn't carry the whole movie. I had to make myself hang in there until the end and the result... it was a waste of my time and $. Sorry, but I would *not* recommend this movie to anyone.",1422835200,3,367,4.111111111111111

8689000,1,B00PQRJ7PQ,"The movie has two good actors in it, Sofia Black-D'elia and James Frain.
  The production values are so D-list I was in agony and had to fast forward. No way I could sit
through it for an hour 45 minutes or whatever the length is.  Possibly the most poorly staged action scenes I've ever seen, especially the home invasion that happens to Black-D'elia.
A major waste of $5.99.",1527292800,,376,4.5

Also kinda heart warming towards the final scenes.

8689006,4,B00PQRJ7PQ,"Born of War is a remarkable achievement by little known, Oxford-based writer and director Vicky Jewson. She finished this movie when she was just 26 years old. Born of War is her second feature film and her first foray into the Action genre.

While the film may not compare favorably with big budget, A-list productions, in truth, it never could have. It's a brilliant effort by a young director working on a shoestring budget of 300,000 pounds. Sure, there are flaws but the criticisms melt away when you consider what all she and producer Rupert Whitaker got onto the screen. BoW was shot on location in Jordan, England, Scotland; helicopters shoot CGI missiles, there were massive pyrotechnics, complex but deft construction of scenes, decent stunts, convincing visual effects, a Learjet fight scene and an original music score . . . . It's no overstatement to say that the 300,000 pounds it took to make this movie looks like several million pounds spent.

Sofia Black-D'Elia as Mina is decent in an emotionally complex role. Her performance was undermined, at least in part, by bad audio recording in a few places. It's really a shame because as I listened to her hollowed out voice in several scenes, I realized that it would have so much more impact if she were on mic and mixed cleanly. That said, she shows great promise here and her career appears to be taking off now. She's already got two big projects releasing this year and next.

James Frain's performance and that of Lydia Leonard and Phillip Arditti were very good. I felt genuinely moved by the predicament that Frain's character faced at the end and the surprising way in which he dealt with it. As surprises go, Leonard's character surprised me completely. I felt for Arditti's character  he deserved so much better than he got, which was another big surprise.

I found Born of War actually improved on the second screening. Flaws, yes. (What film doesn't have flaws?) The enormity of Vicky's achievement just shines. Just look at the trailer and remind yourself, 300,000 pounds all in for shooting. Vicky has the ability to astound and the plot twist at the end of the movie were very good. I look forward to her next effort which, the rumor mill says, will be have a larger budget by orders of magnitude.

If and when Vicky breaks out (my bet is that she will), this will be a movie people will go back to see just to see how far she's come.

Or, see it now and get ahead of the curve.",1429833600,,2458,4.649769585253456
