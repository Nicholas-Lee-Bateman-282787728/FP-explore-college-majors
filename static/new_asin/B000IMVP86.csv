8146336,3,B000IMVP86,"I've been trying to find that episode of ""Charlie Rose"" of June 9, 2000 for some time, because the second half is an interview with Nathan Lane, Kenneth Branagh and Alicia Silverstone to promote their adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Love Labour's Lost"". I really didn't want to pay 25$ for a 30 minutes interview about a very bad movie, but I would have paid the 1.99$ to see it online, unfortunately the service is not available for peoples living in Canada. While searching for a transcript I found the interview available for free on the Charlie Rose's website. Alicia can be seen about 2 minutes at the beginning and just say that basically her manager asked her one morning to do that movie, that she had to audition and that they had a lot of fun filming it. The rest of the interview is mostly Kenneth Branagh who say a lot of various things about movies needing to be well written to make peoples feel the emotions among other things, but really nothing really interesting. Alicia can be seen again for a few emotional minutes near the end. Overall if I hadn't found it online I would probably had paid the 25$ to get that episode (who is burned on a DVD-R) out of curiosity, and I might buy it one day when I have some money available just to have it on a DVD, but there's not much interesting things who are told there.",1333152000,,1326,4.438524590163935
