7283130,1,B00ZJSCMBS,"Men have no obligation to sacrifice their lives for women. Today men are the weaker sex, lacking behind women in almost every aspect including lifespan and education. Why should the inferior give up his life for his superior?

The message this item is sending is dangerous to men and boys in particular, in that it claims that the main objective of the male - and therefore his worth - is his willingness to be disposable. Well I have another message for you boys - your worth is not based on what you are willing to sacrifice for others. You have an own worth in yourself, and you are just as important as anyone else.

The Titanic? It was not a display in courageous men. It was murder on men.",1376352000,,695,4.37984496124031
7283131,5,B00ZJSCMBS,"This excellent documentary takes the cultural decline of manliness head on as it contrasts where we are today with the days of the Titanic. Rooted firmly in the Bible this film does not shy away from the hard duty that we as men must embrace in our families, churches, and communities.",1341532800,12,285,4.607843137254902
8720417,5,B00ZJSCMBS,"We really enjoyed this movie and are considering buying many copies to give away. A must see for men, young men and boys maybe 6 or above.",1494115200,,138,4.148148148148148
8720418,5,B00ZJSCMBS,Mainstream logic 30+ years ago.  Most people now would think it's ridiculous. Too bad. Excellent video for teens on up.,1457568000,,119,4.95
8720419,5,B00ZJSCMBS,"This is an excellent, Christ-honoring comparison of American/British manhood at the time of the Titanic's sinking versus that of our current day.",1455062400,,145,5.636363636363637
8720420,5,B00ZJSCMBS,Like it much....great information,1453507200,,33,7.5
8720421,3,B00ZJSCMBS,Short!,1425513600,,6,6.0
8720422,5,B00ZJSCMBS,A much needed message in a dark world where lies have supplanted the truth at every corner.  This film will help discern the lies of the world!,1410307200,,143,4.296296296296297
8720423,3,B00ZJSCMBS,"If you are looking for a Biblical interpretation of manliness and its decline in modern society, as explained by the fine Christian men in this documentary, you will find what you are looking for here.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for the full development of a theme dealing with the heroism of the men on the Titanic, you will be disappointed.

Only two men and their heroic actions are described here -- Archibald Gracie and Archie Butt.  And, while I appreciated the treatment each of these fine men received in this documentary, I was looking for more.",1398729600,,567,4.65
8720424,4,B00ZJSCMBS,This documentary does a wonderful job of telling the story of the Titanic from a Christian perspective.  What many in our churches across our Western culture is that manhood is dying.  They don't realize what manhood is and what they're losing.  The creators of Act Like Men have provided such a picture by looking at one of the most well known disasters in maritime history and the examples those men set just an hour or less before their deaths in they icy waters.  This is a must have for anyone who wants to be a man and doesn't know how or anyone who needs inspiration.  I highly recommend it!,1377820800,,598,4.4495412844036695
8720425,5,B00ZJSCMBS,"Very well done, and if your looking for an educational, mind motivating movie this is a good watch. This film encourages men to be true men and courageous leaders of their families and society! This message is certainly needed today! Men don't have to be the dumb fumbling fools they are portrayed to be in the latest films but rather can rise up to the challenge and be who they were created to be. Worth your money and time!",1377475200,4,426,4.405063291139241
8720426,5,B00ZJSCMBS,"In an age where manhood and womanhood are being swallowed up into an ambiguous cesspool of androgyny, we need more films like this- films that will call men to be men; films that will hearken back to the chivalrous legacy of Christendom and use past heroics to inspire present heroes; films that will, most importantly, take a firm stand on the truths of Scripture.

The next generation of American men needs to see this film and hear its message.",1377043200,3,447,4.658227848101266
