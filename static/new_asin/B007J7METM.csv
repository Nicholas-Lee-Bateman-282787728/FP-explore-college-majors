8518263,5,B007J7METM,"When I found out that Nancy had made this DVD I wasted no time ordering it. I know Nancy. She is the very capable teacher of the Silver Sneakers class I attend. I can say that the video is excellent. Because of my age and physical ability many of the stretches are ""out of my reach"". But, I do definitely recommend it. She really does cover mind, body and soul as advertised.",1334620800,,375,4.222222222222222
8518264,4,B007J7METM,"Powerful Stretches is the best yoga dvd I have tried so far!!! It includes the triangles and all my other favorite yoga moves with perfect instructions, so I can complete my yoga class at home anytime!!!! I love it :)",1333238400,,217,4.45
8518265,5,B007J7METM,"The DVD is filmed with artistic backgrounds and the instructor has a calming and at times energizing voice which you hear in voice-over giving thorough directions emphasizing proper form and being kind to your body.

I would describe this routine as providing some challenges for anyone but also appropriate for those who are not very flexible or just starting out. It has a nice warm-up followed by standing and mat  stretches that will help you to be more flexible all over and improve your core strength.  Following the stretches there is a relaxation part with gentle music that leaves you feeling peaceful and recharged. None of the poses are what would be called advanced difficulty.

A few times throughout the routine, some Scriptures are spoken between instructions as a pose is held.  Another thing, because of my schedule I don't always have the full 55 minutes to stretch so I really like it that I can select a specific chapter that I have time for or I can just go to the relaxation part to have a little meditation time.  I highly recommended this DVD.",1333238400,3,1067,4.7405405405405405
