2408712,1,B000B8K99S,"Think of this movie as 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back again.  The whole movie is spun around a tale of mistaken identity.  Val's character miraculously and seamlessly goes from being a family physician to a secret agent he has been mistaken for. Instantly Val knows how to disarm somebody with his bare hands, shoot a gun with perfect accuracy, and talk himself out of any situation.

In a nutshell: the script is dreadful, the plot is absurd, the budget is a shoestring, and the acting flounders.  You'd be better off with a 007 movie.",1267833600,18,551,4.591836734693878
2408713,2,B000B8K99S,"Double Identity, also known as Fake Identity, is yet another dull addition to a string of straight to video movies by Val Kilmer.  The film takes elements from North By Northwest, a mistaken identity film by Alfred Hitchcock.  It's equal parts smooth British spies, expressionless Eastern Europeans, and cutthroat diamond merchants.

Val Kilmer is uninspiring as a hapless American doctor in Bulgaria that ultimately travels to Prague to evade his assailants.  The movie's cover is misleading, as it portrays Kilmer as something of a spy or action hero.  Helping him along the way is the lovely secret agent played by Polish actress Izabella Miko (Athena in Clash of the Titans).

The direction and cinematography are both decent, but the acting and writing both are sub-par.  The film lacks an original story, and just isn't suspenseful.  I wouldn't suggest even renting this movie, as it will only remind you of how hard Kilmer has fallen off since the 80's and 90's.",1265673600,17,969,5.0125
2408714,1,B000B8K99S,"The film opens as a vehicle driven by Paul Flemming (Nick Mancuso) becomes mired in snow forcing him to trudge into a nearby small town, New Hope, where Good Samaritan Wayne (Jacques Godin) tows the automobile into a local repair shop, and then invites Paul to his home for dinner, where he meets Wayne's daughter Amy (Leah Pinsent), along with her betrothed, Jeff (Aidan Devine), who is instinctively suspicious of the visitor, and for good reason.  An aspiring author, Paul explains to the others that he is a college professor, yet viewers of this film soon find, after his return to an anonymous large city, that he is instead a strong arm debt collector for an organized crime boss, Raymond Ravennes (Patrick Bauchau), and when a personal cheque that Flemming used to pay for the automobile repair in New Hope bounces, sentiment there naturally turns against him, although Wayne and Amy remain unaware of his vocation as a wrongdoer.  Because she has fallen in love with him, Amy is not convinced that Paul is truly a scoundrel and goes to the ""city"" in an attempt to locate him, but is crestfallen when she discovers that his true name is David Murdock and that he was terminated from his college position.  Meanwhile Paul, having become weary of his criminal existence, criminally assaults his employer and steals a large sum of money from him, whereupon he returns to New Hope with Ravennes in pursuit, and Flemming and Amy, now lovers, are about to face together a hazardous showdown.  Seldom will a viewer experience a storyline hampered by such an extreme lack of logic and risible plot holes as within this film, in addition to drastic flaws in continuity that sharply reduce potential audience interest in the characters, and although the camerawork of Louis de Ernsted is consistently fine, direction by Yves Boisset is inert throughout.  Nick Mancuso has upon occasion performed well, but when unbridled as here through weak leadership, his native hamminess reduces his parts to caricatures.  Others of the cast of capable performers are obviously more comfortable speaking their customary Qubcois than English; however, Anne Ltourneau, in her defense, is especially victimized by the silliest dialogue of the screenplay.  Acting honours must go to Pinsent for her intensely shaded turn in a film that is clearly forgettable.",1148947200,,2340,5.0310077519379846
2408715,5,B000B8K99S,"This 2010 film is an excellent suspense thriller, with many twists. Val Kilmer gets into trouble when in 1992 Bulgaria he allows a pretty woman to enter his car and avoid people who are trying to catch her. He drops her off where she wants to exit and continues to his destination, to help deliver a child. For Kilmer is a physician working with ""Doctors without Borders."" But since he was seen helping the woman, those who saw him think he is John Charter, who they expected would be coming to town. Hence the film's title: Kilmer is a physician and Charter; he has a double identity. He is arrested, but the doctors arrange for his release.

 It appears that there are at least four conflicting groups involved in this crime caper, the unauthorized selling of diamonds, against the rules of the diamond cartel who want to restrain sales to keep diamond prices high. There are agents of the cartel, mob figures who want to sell the illegal diamonds, criminals who want to buy the diamonds, and other criminals who hear about the possible sale and want to steal the diamonds and the money. The police may also be involved, or at least some of them.

 Kilmer knows nothing of this. He does not know who Charter is. He also has no idea what the girl is up to or which side she is on. As we watch the film, we are also left in the dark for a long time. We see that he and the girl become attracted to one another. We see how she tries to protect him. We watch double cross after double cross. We see Kilmer's friend murdered and the police searching for him as the suspected murderer. We watch many chases. We have no idea who John Charter is until near the end of the film. Thus the film is filled with action and suspense. Will Kilmer live to the end of the film? Will the girl survive? Will they get together? Who was in the right?",1300838400,3,1831,4.329446064139941
2408716,1,B000B8K99S,"Who told the fat, slow Kilmer he would be perfect for the role? Why would a beautiful spy fall in love with this dude? If you don't want to take drugs to help you fall asleep, just watch this movie ...

I'm totally picturing Kilmer in his boxer shorts eating pork rinds in his trailer between takes ...",1299974400,3,302,4.206896551724138
2408717,1,B000B8K99S,"DOUBLE IDENTITY made me double angry for wasting my afternoon watching it and I only suffered through its entirety to submit a fair review. Val Kilmer must either owe a favor, need the money or someone has something on him (ie: videotape, pictures?). Or all three. Not only was the plot weak and the acting mediocre, the story was too convoluted. Even the pseudo-love scene looked contrived! Val, Val, what are you doing?! Remember THE DOORS? I guess a free trip to go film in Europe is cool and all but c'mon, where has the substance gone? Low budget is good, weak stories are bad. Maybe the script read really well but the final product is a complete failure. Hopefully he got cozy with the lead actress, total babe! Not recommended for anyone.",1298419200,,746,4.616541353383458
2408718,2,B000B8K99S,The storyline is thin and confusing. Kilmer turns in a decent performance but the overall movie isn't worth the time it takes to watch it. It's sad to see a great actor like Val Kilmer reduced to such sub-par b-movies.,1283126400,,218,4.475
2408719,1,B000B8K99S,"Other than the beautiful Izabella Miko (who plays Katrine), this movie is unwatchable.  In an attempt to make this boring story a thriller, director and co-writer Dennis Dimster gives the audience as much information as to what is going on as the protagonist (Dr. Nicholas Pinter, played by the bloated Val Kilmer).  Essentially, Dr. Pinter is misidentified as John Charter, a character who is not credited.  The film consists of Val Kilmer being made to run (which is unintentionally funny) or be delivered to a series of random scenes.  It's disorienting for the audience, because most of the other characters have some idea of their roles, but Kilmer's character is clueless.

Because this movie is so poor, and there's nothing really much to say about it, I am going to blame Kilmer's long greasy hair and beard for how dumb this movie is.  If your bearded, greasy-haired mug is in every newspaper, and you want to escape detection, perhaps the ""doctor"" would have thought to, I don't know, have a shave and wash and cut his hair.  It could have made for a believable moment in this otherwise imploded mess.",1278201600,5,1111,4.815789473684211
2408720,4,B000B8K99S,"Double Identity has some redeeming value if just for the scenes in and around Sofia, Bulgaria.  A doctor who is with Doctors Beyond Borders (a take off of Doctors Without Borders) gets accidentally caught up in international intrigue dealing with an international smuggling ring.

What I like about the movie is you have no idea who is trying to save him.  You get the hint that Izabella Miko's character is spying at the beginning of the flick, so no spoiler here.  Yet, whom is she spying for?  The action is much more calculating than a spy thriller.  I think the title could have been more of mistaken identity.  Even though he shows he is a doctor, his accusers will not let him be.  There is definately a North by Northwest type of theme here, yet, it is not as exciting, with a much more deliberate tempo.  There are some scenes where there is a bit of time, driving, walking, looking in windows, I actually did a minimum fast forward through these getting the gist and making sure not to miss the dialog.  Hence, the movie dragged less.

I think there is a lot of potential with this movie.  The character actors playing the various roles portrayed a verys serious side of things, I guess international organized crime is more like that than what you may find in a more entertaining film.

The DVD itself needed at least one extra where they told you why they made the film.  That and a little more tempo, would have added to the more stayed role that Val Kilmer plays in Double Identity.",1276560000,3,1496,4.5130111524163565
2408721,1,B000B8K99S,"Where to start... The movie centers around a case of mistaken identity.  A very out of shape (and quite possibly intoxicated) Val Kilmer plays the lead, a doctor mistaken for a spy.  Miraculously Kilmer somehow becomes Jason Borne in the process.  There are double and triple agents involved, none of which are properly introduced.  The viewer has no idea who is working for who (and not in a good way).  The plot lacks any sense of direction and the acting is simply terrible. Set in 1992, all the characters use cell phones and drive cars from the mid 2000s.  It is impossible to follow and the viewer has literally no idea what is happening throughout the movie.  I wouldn't recommend this movie even out of a RedBox.  Instead, save yourself a dollar and 90 minutes of your life.",1276387200,7,782,4.615942028985507
2408722,3,B000B8K99S,Was a little too deep in my opinion.  Maybe I'm too old for this type of movie.  The acting was good though.,1272326400,3,108,3.8636363636363638
2408723,2,B000B8K99S,"I've always liked Val Kilmer's work and thought ""any movie he's in must be good.""  Well, good grief, this flick sucked big time.  It was impossible to recognized a plot line and even fizzled at the end.  Unfortunately, I bought this movie and now wish I had only wasted my money renting it.  Sorry, Val!  Is you're career really in the tank?  I sure hope not!",1269734400,7,359,4.363636363636363
2408724,1,B000B8K99S,This film absolutely had no direction - almost as if it was made up as it went along. The viewer is then stuck trying to follow a plot which then all of a sudden changes for no reason. I agree with the other two reviews - horrible film and Val Kilmer adds nothing to it. This film was just as bad as The Ministers which starred John Leguizamo - and that film was one of the worst in recent history.,1268697600,5,398,3.9875

8083470,5,B000B8K99S,"This movie was pleasantly enjoyable.  I watch virtually everything Val Kilmer is in and his chemistry with (at the time, his girlfriend) co-star Izabella Miko was very enthralling, too.",1433721600,,185,5.379310344827586
8083471,3,B000B8K99S,This was not one of Val Kilmer's better characters. He seemed to just be following what someone else was doing; kind of like going through the motions but not really into it. The storyline was a bit of a mish mash. The most exciting part was when he was running from the bad guys and almost got hit by a train...he didn't. He's a better actor than he portrayed in this film.,1385856000,,374,4.208333333333333
8083472,3,B000B8K99S,"It's not a horrible movie. I've seen much worst. It's a suspense not an action feature that is on par with something you would see on TV. It has a European feel to it and in the credits you will see why. Not as clever as Ocean's 11 but there are plot twists. One that takes advantage of most viewers preconceived notions. As far as Kilmer's character, I didn't see any secret agent stuff so I don't know why there is a believability issue. I started it before bed and finished it the next day, if that tells you anything. Izabella is smoking hot! Would surprise me if Kilmer didn't have any extra curricular rehearsal, off-set, with that one.",1380585600,,642,4.4033613445378155

8083476,2,B000B8K99S,"Double Identity (Dennis Dimster, 2009)

Val Kilmer was once one of Hollywood's most bankable names, appearing in what seemed to be every blockbuster that came out of Hollywood in the late eighties and early nineties, from Top Gun to The Princess Bride to Tombstone and everything in between. But somewhere along the way, something happened, and Kilmer started taking roles that are, shall we say, a little less Hollywood and a little more, well, Moscow Zero and The Thaw and Double Identity. And I will admit, I defended the middle of those.

Plot: Kilmer plays an American doctor who's part of a Doctors Without Borders-style organization, going wherever his talents are needed. This often takes him behind what was at one point the iron curtain; his travels start getting noticed by certain government forces, and he ends up being misaken for a famous Eastern Bloc spy after getting caught in the middle of a nasty firefight where he helps a beautiful young woman (Coyote Ugly's Izabella Miko) escape a hail of bullets. Cue generic thriller.

To be fair, it's not a bad little film; unlike a number of actors whose career has gone to the dogs, requiring them to take roles like this, Kilmer still has a full set of acting chops, and Miko stands up to him just fine most of the time. One more rewrite with an eye towards originality, or even memorability, would have done this movie an excellent turn. As it stands, though, you will likely have forgotten a great deal about it within ten minutes of it ending. There is nothing of substance here, and that is to the movie's great detriment. **",1368748800,,1593,4.723021582733813

A great popcorn eater!!!!!!

Man gets mistaken for someone he ain't. Gets involved with an absolutely beautiful girl (Izabella Miko) that any guy would kill for.

All kinds of things happen to him and her, but in the end they come together and live happily ever after.

Great Schmaltz. Pass the popcorn!!!!!!! :-):-):-)",1311897600,2,401,4.685714285714286
