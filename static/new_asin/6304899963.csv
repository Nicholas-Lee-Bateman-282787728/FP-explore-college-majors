937174,5,6304899963,"Godzilla King Of The Monsters is best monster movie of all time, without it the monster movies wouldn't be a genre the plot opens when a reporter American name Steve Martain (Raymond Burr) is visiting a old collage friend Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) from Tokyo when he arrives there have been reports of ships being deystoryed. Steve Martain joins Japanese scientists one of them Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura), Dr Yamane's daughter Emiko (Momoko Kochi) and her naval officer boyfriend Ogata (Akira Takarada) to envisaged the ships and the islands being deystoryed. Then they come face to face with a 400 foot monster name Godzilla. They try to envisaged where Godzilla came from and discover that he was dinosaur exposed by radioactive atomic bomb. When returning to Toyko Godzilla arrives and destroys thousands of buildings and lives. They try to kill Godzilla with missiles, rockets tanks, and jets then they realize Godzilla is indestructible. The special effects were fantastic for 1956, the rubber suit of Godzilla was well made, the acting is great, the tone and disater are still eerie, the soundtrack of a Godzilla done by Ifukbe Akira is one of the best soundtracks ever and is one of my favorites The only problem I had with this film is that they cut some scenes and dialogue out form the Japanese version but it's still a fantastic film.

937269,5,6304899963,"GODZILLA IS THE ALL-TIME JAPAN MONSTER MOVIE CLASSIC.
I HAVE TO CORRECT AMAZON'S DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT 1st. THE DESCRIPTION STATES "" THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION OF GODZILLA WITHOUT THE AMERICANIZED ADDITION OF RAYMOND BURR""  ....WELL THIS IS WRONG IT IS THE AMERICANIZED VERSION WITH RAYMOND BURR AND THE DVD CASING SHOWS BURR'S PICTURE....ALL WELL THIS IS THE VERSION I WANTED ANYWAY.
THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE CLASSIC WAS ACTUALLY FIRST SHOWN IN 1954 AND WAS IN JAPANESE AND BECAME SUCH A HUGE HIT, THEY DECIDED TO REVISE THE FILM FOR THE AMERICANIZED AUDIENCE. THUS THEY INTRODUCED A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AMERICAN ACTOR AT THE TIME BY THE NAME OF RAYMOND BURR WHO WAS TO BE THE FILMS NARRATOR AS THE AMERICAN REPORTER STEVE MARTIN. ( OF COURSE BURR IS NOW WELL KNOWN FOR HIS ROLES IN DETECTIVE TV SHOWS OF ""PERRY MASON"" and ""IRONSIDES"" )
THE PREMISE OF AN AMERICAN REPORTER ""STEVE MARTIN"" IS KIND OF FAR FETCHED AT THE TIME, TO THINK THAT THE JAPANESE WOULD ACTUALLY LET A AMERICAN REPORTER FOLLOW THEIR TOP JAPANESE SCIENTISTS AND THEIR MILITARY BRASS AROUND IN A JAPANESE CRISIS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE AT THE TIME. STILL THE PREMISE WORKED, AS BURR IN HIS ROLE, NARRATED TO THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE AS GODZILLA TORE APART JAPAN.
SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE THE 1st IN THE MAKING, I MEAN NOBODY HAD MADE A FILM OF SUCH A GIGANTIC CREATURE DESTROYING CITIES TO CORRECT SCALE. IT'S LIKE WATCHING HISTORY IN THE MAKING . OF COURSE MUCH OF THE DESTRUCTION WAS DONE AT NIGHT IN A BLACK AND WHITE FILM, WHICH WAS SMART BECAUSE YOU COULD HIDE A LOT OF STUFF, BUT THE SCALE IN WHICH THEY WERE WORKING HAD NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE. SURE YOU CAN SOMETIMES TELL IT IS A PERSON IN A RUBBER SUIT WALKING ON MINATURES , AND SOME OF THE BUILDINGS LOOK LIKE CARDBOARD, BUT THIS FILM WAS THE 1st OF ITS KIND AND IT PAVED THE WAY FOR MORE JAPANESE BIG MONSTER FILMS.
OF COURSE IF THE FILM FOLLOWED THE ENDING WHICH SHOWS GODZILLA BEING DISSOLVED IN THE SEA AND ONLY HIS BONES BEING INTACT , THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO MORE GODZILLA MOVIES. DEMAND FOR MORE GODZILLA BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM HIS UNTIMELY DEATH AND ALSO CREATED RODAN, MOTHRA...... ETC. ETC.

937298,5,6304899963,"Believe it or not, the answer to the question posed in the title is ""Yes"". The movie, a Japanese production, was originally made in 1954.  This edition was remade for an American audience in 1956 by using Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin. He serves as an on-scene reporter (and narrator) of the movie.

The film begins with Godzilla rising from the ocean floor, killing a number of peaceful Japanese fishermen.  The historical parallel is to the real life radioactive contamination of 23 Japanese fishermen on the ""Lucky Dragon 5"" fishing boat. The first two nuclear test explosions on the Bikini Atoll and the ocean surrounding the atoll were conducted in 1946 (learn more at my review of ""Radio Bikini"").  The fishermen were contaminated by a 1954 test in the same area.

Godzilla is a product of a nuclear explosion. Unleashed on Tokyo the destruction he reeks is as destructive as the fire bombing of Tokyo in WWII and, of course, the A-bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  That is the point of the movie.  In 1956 the Japanese were raising the question of what the unintended consequences of the use of the atomic bomb would be in the future.  The movie's answer: monstrous mutations like Godzilla.

After this movie the Godzilla monster retreated into standard monster fare. Later Godzilla movies were mostly a matter of finding another appropriate monstrous colossus to fight it. Raymond Burr's performance is solid as usual. Everyone else in the movie is Japanese and dubbed in English.

One piece of trivia I found interesting is that Burr turned down the role when it was first offered to him because of time commitments.  He was persuaded to take it when he was promised that he would only be required to work one day.  The producers then made him work a straight 24 hours with only occasional breaks.

937303,5,6304899963,"HA!  Imagine that, I'm the first one to get to review one of the old classics!  HA!  Finally, today is my day.

First of all, I like all these old monster movies, especially the really big monsters.  Godzilla is somewhere between 300 and 400 feet tall (I got that from the dialogue in the movie), that constitutes BIG.  So you can expect my review to be a half star to one star higher than most others.

So lets get with it.  (I'm watching it again as I review it).

PROS:
1.  Stars Raymond Burr, that's a star.
2.  Great music, four notes on a piano and three notes on a clarinet--works just fine.  That's a star.
3.  Special effects, everybody knows the Japanise did the best scaling on cities and toy cars and things than anybody else.  Though you can in several scenes (where godzilla is jerking around) tell it's just a man in a rubber suit...so what.  It's all shot in that great old Black and white film.  They get a star.
4.  The acting, directing, writing are just fine for an old popcorn movie, that's a star.
5.  The idea. That's another star because of the way it is handled.  A very big lizard is waken up, or resurrected, or frankensteined together, because of H Bomb Test.  And what's a big lizard to do when woke up from a 200 million year sleep?...go find the guys who did it and stomp their city to rubble.  Yes sir, NOBODY does it better or equal to godzilla!  The story starts off with Raymond Burr's plane flying several miles above the ocean just as the big lizard decides to sink its first ship.  He is questioned by the authorities--he was asleep and spends some part of the movie running around with the scientist and military as they try to figure out what is going one.  It helps that godzilla stomps his way onto one of the islands late night and smashes a rather large village, small town.  Of course it has to be the one Ramond is sleeping on.  He doesn't see the monster but everybody hears it coming.  I guess the whole world knows THOSE foot steps.  We don't get to see it either except for the bottom part of its' left leg.  But that's okay, the next time it comes stomping ashore it does so in full day light.

Welp...there's no doubt now!

Yea know, godzilla has just about the same amount of respect for a military tank as a tornado does for a trailer...something about those two just don't get along!

Moving along:  There a few incidents, all of them seem well done, the scaling continues to be the best out there...no need for computer graphics in these old movies.  They must have had background actors in the high hundreds to low thousands to shoot some of these scenes.

Well, I don't want to giveaway all the story to those of you who have never seen this movie before--all three of you.  I will say, it is a clean movie through and through.  It is the stuff that used to give me nightmares when I was a young kid  45 or more years ago.  Some of the scenes actually look real.  I do recomment it to all the growing popcorn crowd and all of you who like to watch 'old' classics.  For all the old giant monster type movies this is probably the best one to ever come from overseas.

CONS:
1.  I could set here and pick this or any popcorn movie to pieces...but why do it?  It is a fine movie.  It is a monster movie.  It is a BIG monster movie.  I've seen better, I've seen worse.  It is a BIG MONSTER movie that demands popcorn and soda.  Remember, it is a classic and is the original godzilla from which all the others came from.

Buy, don't rent the classics.

937304,5,6304899963,"Allthough the American version of ""Gojira"" is not quite as good as the original Japanese version, give Raymond Burr credit for doing a pretty job of not only his narration during the course of the film, but for his portrayal of United World News reporter Steve Martin as well.  Sure, people may think that the American version of this film is not quite as good, but I think the American version does alright.

Nonetheless, the special effects for this film are very good and after seeing this film for the first time, it scared me out of my socks.  I also became a huge Godzilla fan because of this movie.  ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters,"" as it is known in the USA, or ""Gojira,"" as Japanese fans know this movie, are both good.  Purchase the Japanese and American versions of this cult classic and judge them for yourself.",1160006400,,824,4.54054054054054
937305,3,6304899963,"I can recall the awe I felt when seeing ""Godzilla"" for the first time as a young child; I had nightmares about the giant beast walking through the streets of my neighborhood.  I dreamt I was hiding from the stomping feet of the great lizard.  Of course, I didn't really know what good filmmaking was in those days.

The one good thing about any version of the original Godzilla is the amazing roar the creature produced - is there anything else like it?  Who could forget the great blast of sound that shook an entire city, and became the legendary voice of the great beast?  Whether one likes the Godzilla films or not, all know that sound...

The Americanized version of ""Godzilla"" seems to suck the life right out of the film.  Raymond Burr's inserted scenes mostly consist of reaction shots with a blank look on his face - and there are many of them.  Then there is the obvious difference in film stock quality:  the original Japanese scenes are grayer and of poor quality, the American scenes of far better quality.  The English dubbing for the Japanese characters is plain laughable; it is clear they are not really talking about the same thing the dubbing indicates!  Due to this fact, many scenes in the film seem to make no sense whatsoever.

I recently saw the film on the AMC cable channel, and found myself wishing I could see the original version in Japanese with subtitles - fortunately a restored DVD with both the Raymond Burr scenes and the original Japanese version will soon be available.  At last, Godzilla will be seen the way he should be.

937363,4,6304899963,"GODZILLA---KING OF MONSTERS has been frequently remade and sequelled ad nauseam, but this 1956 film (titled GOJIRA in Japan) stands alone as the best of the Japanese monster movies.

Produced right after the hapless ""Lucky Dragon"" was sunk during the initial H-bomb test, and just eleven years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, GODZILLA is not simply a cautionary tale about nuclear war. Rather, the monster IS nuclear war personified in all its directed, vicious, city-destroying horror.

GOJIRA was pointedly political. The film's American distributors believed its antinuclear message would not sell in 1950s America, (they may have been right) and edited out most of the sociopolitics, replacing the message with segments of Raymond Burr (playing journalist Steve Martin) reporting from Japan about the giant fire-breathing reptile.

Although Godzilla is a man-in-a-rubber-suit monster, that fact is lost in this, the darkest of the Godzilla films. Godzilla IS terrifying, not least because although most monsters are presented as ""forces of nature"" Godzilla seems to exhibit both malice and intent as he lays waste to Tokyo.

It's well known that Godzilla subsequently ""found religion"" and allied himself with mankind in battling a host of other monsters (Rodan, Mothra, Ghidrah, Monster X, the Smog Monster, and Mechagodzilla come to mind) in other films, but none of them has the power to invoke fear and thought as does this original film.",1119225600,2,1443,5.4
937364,5,6304899963,"What evil genius thought to splice a Japanese monster movie together with US-shot Raymond Burr footage to create the PERFECT monster movie?!

The differences in production values between the original and the manufactured scenes is fascinating. The glimpse into fragments of Japanese culture is also fascinating and was a unique and driving experience when I was a kid fascinated by this movie. Godzilla is so much more than a guy in a Godzilla suit stomping a model of Tokyo flat -- someone left the door open and glimpses of a tantalizing alien culture far more sophisticated and civilized than our own were allowed to be seen by the second-third waves of Baby Boomer kids.

The awesome score drives this one over the top, over the MOON. Godzilla isn't just a bull's-eye, it's the arrow the mythical archer split the tree with. Cheap special effects (the Holy Grail of 50s SciFi) abound.

The acting in the Japanese version is very good and emotionally moving, the US-produced acting, aside from Raymond Burr is directly from Central Casting. The monster itself, Godzilla, Gojira, is of mythical proportions. A huge monster awakened by atomic detonations from its sixty-million-year-long sleep destroys all it sees. It's unimportant why. Destruction is absolute. ""And all man's genius seemed pale and weak"" is a great line from a similar Japanese monster movie -- the humbling experience that a giant monster is eating our lunch and that we are powerless. In the 1950s! The height (up until 2005) of military-worship!

Science fiction is a liberating vehicle as far as being able to present a possible world, possible worlds, which would otherwise mightily piss off the status quo, get you burned at the stake. And so Godzilla allows the notion that other realities could be just as real as what you're doing right now. Maybe there is something else out there. It's entertaining, it's enlightening, it's empowering. And Godzilla tragically dies with Dr. Sarazawa and the secret of his Oxygen Destroyer at the end of the movie, ""Live happily with Emiko."" OH MY GOD. How Japanese can you get? BRILLIANT STUFF.

I have honestly lost track of how many times I've watched Godzilla. It was the first videotape I bought when I first bought a VCR ($80 for a tape?!). Since then I've found the original Japanese version (it would make a great B side to a future edition of this DVD). I still love this movie. I know it through and through. It's fascinating in its original Japanese version, but somehow, accidentally, the US-spliced version transcends itself and gracefully rises to an iconic height -- this is a fun movie to watch, but it's also the true high-water mark for the entire genre of giant monster movies, effortlessly surpassing *everything* produced before or since.

The schlocky US-produced bits mingle with the very well produced Japanese original, held together with Raymond Burr -- when a ""real"" actor takes a science fiction role seriously it makes an enormous difference -- think of Forbidden Planet and the original The Thing From Another World -- while Godzilla doesn't have the budget of either of those movies, Raymond Burr's acting carries the day. The result is a brilliant, never-to-be-repeated amalgam of pieces which somehow tell a taut, compelling story that will delight every little boy who likes monster movies.

Godzilla is truly the greatest monster movie ever made. Godzilla is one of the best movies ever made, it may not be The Rules of the Game but it's a lot of fun, and fun ought to count for more than it ordinarily does when it comes to ranking movies.

BUY THIS ONE RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT.

937386,4,6304899963,"Well this is the first time I've ever watched this film.  It's in black & white, and really takes on shows like Lost in Space, or maybe even Dracula, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Frankenstien.  It's really old so it didn't have to be convincing in terms of special effects.  It's the nostalgia of the times.

What I enjoyed was the Japanese Americans actors they used throughout the movie.  Their Japanese is minimal but certainly was convincing enough for me to believe that the white guy reporter was originally in the film. (he was added in for the U.S.).  Also there seemed to be more close up shots of everyone.  For instance the boats that were dissappearing.  They actually showed sailors aboard them having fun, before they were torn apart by Godzilla.  Also the some of the scenes used lots of extras which are at the bottom of Tokyo.  This makes it more terrifying for the movie.  The rubber suit Godzilla doesn't look so fake, once you see injuries and people starving and looking for their loved ones that were lost at sea.

Okay with this said, I would still say the old school Godzilla sequals with Mothra, Mecha Godzilla still rule my collection.",1105488000,2,1164,4.651960784313726
937387,2,6304899963,"NOTE: This review was written in 2004 for the now discontinued American version of Godzilla.  That version did NOT include the Japanese version.  Amazon links all versions of the DVD, so my review is now showing up for the newer DVD version.

The original version of this film, entitled ""Gojiro,"" was a huge hit in Japan, and was even nominated for their Best Film award.  However, American distributors apparently thought that it would not play well in the U.S.  So they sheared about 20 minutes from the original and added new scenes featuring Raymond Burr, fresh from the success of ""Rear Window.""

Burr plays Steve Martin, an American reporter visiting Japan.  When Burr arrives in Tokyo, he receives news that a giant monster named Godzilla has attacked a ship and is wreaking havoc.  His friend, Dr. Kyohei Yamane, is one of the preeminent scientists trying to solve the mystery of Godzilla, giving Burr a front seat view to the proceedings.

Unfortunately, the new scenes with Burr are not well-integrated, with many scenes featuring Burr standing with a few Asian extras.  In addition, by deleting scenes, the action becomes rather incomprehensible, and the Japanese stars are reduced to minor characters.  In particular, an important love triangle featuring Dr. Yamane's daughter, Emiko, is completely stripped of context.  All the tension is drained from this version as the audience doesn't connect with the Japanese stars.  Although the original version is now available, this one is what you're likely to catch on TV.  A real abomination.",1102636800,33,1551,5.103174603174603
937388,5,6304899963,"I love Godzilla. I grew up on the old Godzilla cartoons (as cheesy as they were) and the even more cheesier films. My favorite Godzilla movie has to be the original 1956 black and white film. The premise of the film was much more darker and serious than the campier films from the '70s and '80s. Godzilla comes to life due to nuclear radiation. The film is a cautionary tale of the dangers of nuclear weapons and Godzilla (in some bizarre way) is a metaphor for nuclear bombs). The results is pure chaos. No one is safe from the fire breathing monster. Raymond Burr plays an American journalist who witnesses the catastrophic mess that Godzilla leaves in his wake. The 'special effects' are rather limited but that is what film studios were given at the time. Actually I will take the cheesy props and special effects over most CGI used in films today (especially what was in that monstrosity of the Americanize, watered down version of ""Godzilla). My only flaw with this dvd is that I wish that this version of the film was the original Japanese version minus Raymond Burr. I don't mind Raymond per say but it would have been nice if there was a dvd that included the original Japanese film.",1102636800,6,1192,4.574766355140187
937389,5,6304899963,"This review is mainly concerned with the original, Japanese version of Gojira (not dubbed).  I find that inserting Raymond Burr's character and removing some of the original to do so takes a great deal away from this movie and what it represents.

Godzilla rises from his long sleep due to the effects of the hydrogen bomb.  With each attack, the creature becomes more bold until Tokyo suffers a devasting attack, and only a miracle can save the country from another tragic visit by this risen giant.

The love affair plays a secondary but important part in the film.  Emiko has been promised in marriage to a brilliant young scientist but has fallen in love with another man.  It is the old world traditions clashing with modernity.  Her father is a paleontologist who is probably the only person sharing empathy with Godzilla, feeling that destroying the beast will be depriving science of its one and only chance to study a creature from the prehistoric past.

What is often overlooked (and not really stressed in the American version) is the terrible dilemma the young scientist faces when he is begged to use his oxygen destroyer weapon against Godzilla.  Only the viewing of the destruction and sadness make him realize there is only one course to take.  I feel he is the most crucial and yet saddest character in the entire movie.  He actually loses on a number of counts--his life's work (he destroys his formula so it could never fall into the wrong hands), his fiancee has decided to wed another, and in true samurai-like tradition, ends his life nobly.  The scene of Godzilla's painful death at the same moment that this brave but troubled researcher ends his own is poignant in the extreme.

This film is not just about humans against an ancient monster awakened from the past.  It is about the universal emotions of love, dedication and the dangers to which science can lead us.  It is also about sacrifice and triumph over impossible odds.

It is important to remember that the original movie was produced not that many years after the devastation wrought on Japan by the atomic bombs.  It does not take much of the imagination to see the same destroyed cities, dying and injured people and the heartache produced by an attack, whether monster or man-made, on such a massive scale.  The burning buildings, high levels of radioactivity, the melting metal all conjure up the effects of the atomic bomb, and in many ways this movie is an illustration of what Japan experienced, as well as providing a cathartic effect to a nation that suffered perhaps the greatest horror of this century.

The underlying message here is that, like the oxygen destroyer, atomic weapons are the most destructive device ever invented by man.  This movie, besides being a very scary monster film (it gave me nightmares when I was a little girl) is an anti-nuclear weapon vehicle which gets its message across through the characters of a enormous beast, a scientist faced with a moral decision, and a people bent on surviving.  Godzilla is more then a movie; it is a social statement against any weapon that has the power to alter our world, and the people in it, forever.

I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the old gentleman who was encased within the Godzilla costume.  A very short man playing a huge monster (he was about 5 feet tall), he was nevertheless delighted and surprised that his portrayal of the beast has continued to draw audiences even after all these years. It was an honor to meet him.

My advice is the best way to see this movie is in the original, uncut Japanese version without dubbing.  I am not a big fan of dubbing anyway, and feel that since people know the story and what is being said, the language barrier disappears and the emotional impact of the film is felt on a much higher scale.

To me, this is one of the best movies produced and has stood the passing of time.  It holds many lessons for those who are open to the warnings and human tragedies, both physical and emotional, that we are forced to face in a world that has advanced to the point of self-annihilation.",1100908800,33,4096,4.6923076923076925

However this version is not all bad. The editing was nothing short of genius. What they managed to do by inserting a character into a movie that he wasn't in was very crafty. It actually seems as if Steve Martin is interacting with the original actors. That is done very well.

 The major qualm that I have with this film is that it is sometimes dubbed and sometimes it is not. There are extended scenes where everything is in Japanease and no subtitles. Steve Martin is often there for the sole surpose of asking ""hey what did those folks just say?""

 Considering that this movie was made 50 years ago (hmm...warrants a demicentenial edition methinks), it has stood the test of time. Godzilla's rampages look just as real, if not more real than those of later Godzilla movies. The anti-nuke message is also very powerful even in the watered down American version.

937437,5,6304899963,"This is the original Japanese 'man in a lizard suit' movie, and is still very respectable despite being 48 years old. This movie is a gritty, darker type of Godzilla movie than the films that follow in the series. In this one Godzilla is clearly the bad guy (not so in many later incarnations) and obliterates Tokyo. As is virtually always the case in films of this genre from Japan of that era, the movie is essentially an anti-nuclear cautionary tale, and as such is vastly more effective than most of the films that followed in its footsteps.
Originally a 100 minute (or so) movie made in Japan with an all Japanese cast, the film was edited to its present 78 minutes and Raymond Burr was added as a reporter to position it better at the American box office. Although this was probably unnecessary, Burr acquits himself well, and it is not jarringly edited like some films in which additional scenes have been added later.
It's a given that the special effects are cheesy, but that does not denigrate this as a meritorious film. The acting and script are quite good, and the scenes generally are done quite dramatically, using the actors and sets to good effect. No fan of sci-fi should be without this, the original, and still best, Japanese monster movie.",1085011200,12,1260,4.654708520179372

Wow it sure is amazing. When I was kid back in 94 and beyond we would be watching dubbed tapes of Godzilla VS the Sea monster and other things, and let me tell you, those were great times. BUT I never got the cahcne to watch to classic motion picture ""Godzilla: King of the monsters"" till recently.
Now at the time this film came out, it was amazing, because at the time there were no computers, or anything to really do any amazing special effects, with that said and done everything actually looks pretty good, even though you can tell what millitary veichles and cars were models, everything is actually kind of conving. And for Japan this was kind of a hard movie to swallow, in the origanal version there were scenes when a mother held her child and said ""Its okay, we will be with daddy soon."" before Godzilla crushed them. Many scenes like that were edited or removed, and if you notice there is a scene on a train where people are laughing, but what they cut out was when a woman said ""I survived the (I forgot what the city was called) bombing."" and some guy laughed and said ""Then you won't surive this."" momets before Godzilla picked up the train and ate it (which is one of the MOST popular Godzilla images, Godzilla with that train in his mouth) It was probably very hard for the Japanese people to stomach seeing a monster spawned out of nuclear testing destroying their city, so shortly after millions died from atomic bombings.
One beef I have, is that sense the film was in black and white it was some times hard to see Godzilla during the night shots (That or my TV had low contrast or something). And the whole Raymond Burr thing.
But let me tell you, With the deep soundtrack (You can hear the original versions of many rememberal Godzilla songs here) and other things you seem to have a real sense of terror when Godzilla destroys the cities.
Overall I would suguest this film highly, even though it is in fact edited (Almost 30 minutes were removed, and 20 minutes added with Raymond burr) from the Japanese version, it is still a good watch, and afterthe uncut editon comes out, it will be interesting to have the ""Old American"" version.

937481,5,6304899963,"For any movie to merit a sequel, or 22 sequels for that matter, it has to be special. ""Gojira"" stands on the lofty summit with ""Dracula""; ""Frankenstein""; ""Forbidden planet""; ""War of the Worlds"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as one of the great science fiction films of all time. What we have here is a synergy of a monster tale, a moral dilemma, and a powerful anti-war message. Together the film becomes a visionary tale of man trying to survive the fury of the Atom bomb made flesh. It examines the consequences of our sins, and asks directly if we have learned from our mistakes and what we are willing to do to prevent making those same mistakes again. ""Gojira"" is about the green big one, yes, but it also examines like no other film in the series the consequences of the monster's rampages. ""Gojira"" was made to be a drama first, a science fiction fantasy second. The film portrays real human suffering because of Godzilla's depredations. This draws the viewer wholeheartedly into the struggle of the Japanese people as they try to survive this catastrophe. As a drama, ""Gojira"" invests the time to develop characters who we can in turn invest in. Dr. Serizawa's dilemma at using his invention to save Japan at the possible cost of the world is brilliantly acted. As is Emiko Yamane's torment at having to betray her fiance to a man she really loves in order to save Japan from Godzilla. The film doesn't shy away from messy solutions either. Like most science fiction films, the scientist uses an invention to destroy the monster at the end of the film. Unlike most science fiction films, the scientist chooses to die with his invention rather than let it be used for evil ends. It is this kind of daring and  innovative filmmaking that lifted ""Gojira"" above the multitude of other 50's radioactive monster films onto a level all its own. The final testament to the power of ""Gojira"" is that it is the only old Godzilla film that is not diminished when adapted for an English speaking audience. Rather, the addition extra scenes with Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin, add a clever and worthwhile perspective to the action unfolding in the film.

937483,1,6304899963,"I'm well-aware that this movie had been chopped up by us Americans when we released this movie in the states.  And so my following mini-review is based on ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" starring Raymond Bore...I know it's spelled ""Burr"" but since there was no respect for the original Japanese edit of this movie, I'll show similar respect for this actor's wooden performance.
First off, why?  Why on Earth did there have to be inserts of an American actor?  Did we put an American actor in ""Seven Samurai"" before it was shown in the US?  No, so what's the deal?
I'm only griping about this because, well, Raymond Burr is BORING.  He shows no range of acting ability - it's therefore a mystery as to why we felt the need for his presence?  He adds nothing special to the flick.  He can't act.  He's boring.  And he can't even pronounce ""shortlived"" correctly which is sad considering he's American.  I feel no remorse in knocking every little flaw about Raymond Bore because someone important thought he could do a better job than the Japanese star.  And because of our need to put a caucasion star in the movie, we end up with a series of human scenes in which the star doesn't interact with the rest of the cast.  Sure, they try to make it look like he's talking to some of the REAL Japanese stars, but overall, Raymond Bore feels like he's in his own little world devoid of character interaction.
In any case, I'm not sure who to blame for this one, but the scenes don't flow well together.  As a matter of fact, they don't flow period.  Watching this movie is like watching a series of unrelated scenes thrown together for no apparent reason; the only thing binding the scenes together is that they're all part of this movie called ""Godzilla.""
As for the monster scenes, they're way too over-rated.  I wasn't entertained at all by Godzilla's presence.  It was boring, and I never felt his impact.  The humans don't really confront him - the movie says they do, but you don't really see it.  So you get very little action between Godzilla and the military.  And if I didn't say so already, the monster scenes don't flow well with the human scenes.
In the final scene where the scientist and the other guy go underwater to place the Oxygen-destroyer, I didn't feel the emotional impact that I was supposed to feel.  Even when the scientist decides to end his life, I felt nothing.  I was saying to myself ""who really cares?""  I mean, the movie tried to play it serious and emotional, but it fails.
Overall, you get a serious movie that doesn't engage/interest the viewer very well.  You get horrible character interaction between the ""stars.""  None of the scenes flow well together.  The monster action is boring.  A very weak title.  It's really no wonder why the most popular Godzilla movies are the really campy ones with hilarious dialogue, and great monster action.  I have yet to see a serious Godzilla movie that entertained me.
Yes, I wish I had access to the original Japanese version.  But I still don't know if I'd like it due to its serious content which rarely impresses me in a Kaiju movie.  I'd still recommend seeing either version at least once just to say you've seen the Original Godzilla.  After you've seen it, feel free to let your disc collect dust because you're unlikely to ever watch it again.",1077235200,4,3323,4.590831918505942

That being said, the Americanized ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" is pretty good for what it is. The original film isn't ruined, but it is a lesser experience. It's worth a three-star rating at least, but the uncut Japanese version is a five-star classic and it's unfortunate that most Americans haven't had a chance to experience it.
For non-Godzilla fans, a bit of explanation of exactly what is on this disc is necessary. ""Godzilla"" (the Japanese title is actually ""Gojira,"" a fanciful combination of the words for ""gorilla"" and ""whale"") was released in 1954 and was a huge hit in its home country. It was a frightening vision of radioactive horror returning to mainland Japan, and director Ishiro Honda poured his heart and soul into the terror and sorrow of the story. The original film is devastating in its impact, and Eiji Tsubaraya's effects are startling in their intensity: shots of Godzilla's immense shadow lumbering over a Tokyo in flames, helpless victims cowering in the destruction, are images that cannot be erased from memory, and the pounding, threatening score only heightens the sense of doom.
A group of American businessmen picked up the film to distribute to U.S. audiences in 1956, who at the time were lining up to see ""big bug"" and monster flicks like ""Them"" and ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (which actually inspired the original ""Godzilla"" in the first place). The distributors recognized a potential hit, but knew there would be no money in it if it were released in subtitled form: they wanted to get the matinee and drive-in teen crowd. So they re-edited the film, removing around 30% of the Japanese footage and replacing it with footage of Raymond Burr (who, no kidding, shot all his scenes in a single twenty-four hour period), who plays a reporter named Steve Martin (no snickering, please) who is in Tokyo during Godzilla's rampage. Other footage was juggled around and rearranged, and some of the context and story were altered, much of which dampened Godzilla's radioactive nature.
The new footage is actually quite clever, and fits in well with the Japanese footage. Using extras shot from the back actually allows Raymond Burr to ""interact"" with the film's stars in a few scenes. Burr gives a serious performance that is respectful to the original film. Because a guide translates much of the dialogue for Raymond Burr, many scenes are able to stay in Japanese (this means less dubbing, good news for everybody, since the dubbed scenes are horribly synced.) The American producers obviously were trying to manufacture the best film they could, and I think they succeeded.
But, no doubt, it is an inferior ""3-star"" version of the movie. Godzilla himself is still there in all his terror and majesty, and the central Tokyo rampage remains a stunning piece of work. Banish thoughts of ""heroic"" Godzilla; this is the embodiment of radioactive horror and man's own destructive impulse. But the story surrounding Godzilla, about tragic scientist Dr. Serizawa and elder scientist Dr. Yamane, and the love triangle between the three young leads, is severely weakened. Serizawa's story no longer packs the punch that is required for the real human element of the story to work. Scenes of Japanese citizenry reacting to what amounts to a second atomic bombing of their country have also been cut out. The Americanized version is a darn good monster flick, but not much more. (And, sadly, the quality of the print on this DVD isn't the best.)
So understand what you are getting on this disc: a pretty good Americanized version of the film, but not the Japanese masterpiece that needs to get its own special edition DVD one of these days.",1076284800,10,4160,4.952789699570816

937486,4,6304899963,"On August 6, 1945 the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. An estimated 130,000 people were killed and 90% of the city was completely leveled. Japan never completely recovered from that incident.
Ten years later Japan was the site of another catastrophic event. On November 3, 1955 many Japanese fishing boats were being destroyed by what was called ""a wall of fire"" on the ocean. Many scientists were called in to investigate the mystery. It was eventually discovered that the cause of the burning fire on the ocean was a prehistoric creature resurrected from its eternal rest by the resulting radiation of the Hiroshima incident. The prehistoric creature, was known as ""Godzilla.""
Driven by animal instincts Godzilla eventually made his way to Tokyo where he proceeded to decimate the entire city. Japan's army fought by bravely, but their efforts proved futile against Godzilla's sheer strength and resistance. Although his attack was brief, the death toll and destruction was even higher then the Hiroshima blast.
Godzilla was too big of a threat for the world to ignore, something had to be done and quickly, before Godzilla could attack again. Shortly after the last attack, Dr. Serizawa came public with his latest discovery. A device capable of removing all oxygen in the area of water it resided in. This device was dubbed the Oxygen Destroyer. It was decided that the Oxygen Destroyer was the only means capable of defeating Godzilla.
Dr. Serizawa hesitantly let his creation be used. He was lowered into Tokyo Bay near the location of Godzilla, where the Oxygen Destroyer was activated. The device proved to be a success and Godzilla was destroyed, suffering a very slow, painful death, leaving behind nothing more than a gigantic skeleton. Unfortunately Dr. Serizawa was also lost. He committed suicide and died with Godzilla, taking the secrets of the Oxygen Destroyer with him to the grave.
With Godzilla gone, the survivors set about the arduous task of rebuilding their once impressive civilization.
This is truly a classic amongst monster movies. To this day I can still remember the terror I felt when I saw ""Godzilla"" for the first time when it appeared on TNT during an all night marathon.
For years I've searched for a good copy of this movie and just recently I found the movie that first introduced me to what was destined to become a legend of epic proportion.
Film quality-wise the movie looks old in some scenes. It could've been cleaned up but I think it helps add to the atmosphere of the movie.
The reason for the four star rating is because of the DVD itself. It would've received a five if it had more features. It should've had a copy of the orginal Japanese version with English subtitles, maybe a two disc package for collectors.
Overall I wold reccomend this DVD to anyone who can't find the original ""Gojira"". If you saw it as a kid, get it and rediscover the sense of terror you felt so long ago.",1072569600,,2934,4.846613545816733

The original version was deemed too ""japanese"", so we added our own americanized scenes to placate american audiences. I see this as a mistake.

It is a true master piece, not only for the generation - but for all time. This is the one that started it all. Not just my obsession, but the obsession of millions across the world. Enter, Godzilla - King of the Monsters. The film begins with a narraration by Steve Martin (Raymond Burr, who is not in the original Japaneese version) - and his description of an odd occourence the night before. Then we are visited by a nightmarish montage of people dead, dying or wounded. The film continues on with the 'adventures' of Martin and a doctor, Doctor Serizawa (a brilliant one for that matter, he has discovered the formula to kill oxygen) - both trying to discover a way to kill a beast that has been stalking the harbors of Japan for a while. That beast - is Godzilla. This film is flawless. Steve Martin (Burr) add's alot of realism to this with his new editorial like commentary, and the image of Godzilla has burned an image in everyone's mind who has viewed this film. As the final scene in glorious black and white rolled, tears came to my eye. This film began a lifelong obsession with me. The Godzilla suit is the best one. The most fearsom and menacing, with razor sharp teeth, sinster and narrow eyes and cat-like ears. As the film moves along, you are no longer a part of this word - you enter a world much like this one, only there is a giant, lizard like, mutated, atomic monster in this one. The story wraps around your brain and doesn't let you go. You cheer and jeer as the image of Godzilla's image flashes onto the screen, but shiver in fear at the same time. You feel the terror of Steve Martin, Doctor Serizawa and the rest of the cast - and the joy of Godzilla as he breathes his Radioactive Breath onto hoards of helpless citizens. Godzilla Is, most definetly, and always will be - The King of the Monsters. Now about the DVD. This is a very good transfer. Although the picture is a bit murky, it is still very crisp and sharp, and a bit scratchy here and there. The sound is great! On a sorround-sound Dobly Digital 5.0 setup, the sound quality is very very good, the kind you need to view a Godzilla Flick. This disc is a region 1 disc, if anyone really needs to know - if you all have strict Region-1 players. Sony really did a good job on the transfer (unlike Simitar who had a video-like transfer) but they could have added some special features for this historical film.. Maybe even a 2nd disc, with the Japaneese Version. But that is a bit of a high hope. But this is still a great-quality DVD, for a flawless, beautiful, perfect film.

Everyone knows the story of Godzilla.  Radioactive sciencey stuff awakens a great big monster, which proceeds to stomp through downtown Tokyo killing many, and making a general nuisance of himself.  The Japanese military tries to stop Godzilla, because it gives them something to do.  Nothing political, nothing controversial - just a fun movie about big things beating up on little things.  For the US release of this, the first film in the series, they decided to add footage of Raymond Burr, which brings us to the first obvious thing to talk about.
Raymond Burr is so badly inserted into the original movie, one would believe that he shot all of his scenes in a single afternoon.  He talks to people from the main movie on the phone; he spies at them through binoculars.  Occasionally one of the characters from the actual film will speak to him.  Raymond Burr's character (hilariously named Steve Martin - I cracked up every time that was mentioned) will then hold a fascinating conversation with the back of some extra's head.  He lurks in the background with little to do but smoke, and ask his Japanese friends for translations.
The beginning of the movie drags quite a bit.  This is because it takes half an hour for the eponymous star to appear in the flesh.  And frankly, if there isn't a giant guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings, then I ask myself what the point is.  That said, I was impressed by those initial Godzilla attacks.  There's an obvious metaphor for nuclear destruction being played out in the opening sections, which is handled quite well.  However, once the monster appears in the flesh, we move away from the artsy similes and move on to the smashing.  Yes!
Godzilla smashes a lot in the film.  I counted ships, trains, power-lines, police cars and lots of random buildings as destroyed during this rampage.  Thousands dead, Tokyo in ruins - a good day for the big guy.
This particular DVD probably wouldn't be the one to use if you're going to show off your brand-new, ultra-expensive home entertainment system to your friends.  The picture is scratchy, the sound isn't great, but it's a movie about a big monster smashing Japanese stuff, so who cares what the quality is like?
You should know exactly what you're getting in for before you even think about buying this DVD.  I've not seen all of the films in the Godzilla series, although I must say that I do prefer the other entries that significantly increased the cheese-factor.  This, the first, is a decent enough film.  I was entertained during much of it, and I don't really ask for much more from monster movies.",1057449600,3,2858,4.7082494969818915

In the later films, Godzilla is often portrayed as an almost cartoony, giant monster hero, who instead of terrorizing Japan tries to save it.

The added scenes with Raymond Burr make the film more understandable for we dumb Americans, almost totally preventing any jokes to be made about bad dubbing.

937550,4,6304899963,"GODZILLA's chances for American distribution were nil until a savvy Hollywood company snapped up the rights, chopped out a chunk, and replaced the edited footage with new scenes starring Raymond Burr.  The resulting film was a mix of bad acting, static cinematography, and expensive but essentially ""B"" level special effects--but when Godzilla stomped up from Tokyo Bay with the worst breath this side of Osaka, the American public took him to heart, and he's been a cult icon ever since.
In theory, the film is a serious and subtle commentary on the dangers of nuclear warfare.  In practice, it doesn't quite work out that way.  The Japanese and American scenes blend very badly; the Japanese cast either overplays or underplays to a ridiculous degree; and Raymond Burr is about as expressive as Mount Rushmore.  What with fainting lab assistants, boiling fish, hysterical sailors, and Burr's clenched lips, ""serious and subtle"" don't stand a chance.  And then there's the monster.  This was actually one of the most expensive films made in Japan up to that time--but even so, Japan was light years away from Hollywood when it came to special effects.  Godzilla is very clearly a man in a rubber suit.  Tokyo is very clearly a miniture set.  But the surprising thing about this is that it's a darned good rubber suit and a darned good miniture set.  And it proves extremely entertaining.

937551,4,6304899963,"The first Godzilla film in what has proven to be an immensely popular and profitable series is totally unlike its sequels.  The viewing public has seen so many of these sequels that it tends to forget that the original Tokyo-bashing creature was no fun-loving overgrown house pet whose primary job it was to battle other and equally juvenile monsters.  This Godzilla was a serious-minded throwback to the Jurassic that somehow had imbibed our twentieth century nuclear fires to lay waste a country that just ten years earlier had two of its cities serve as holocaustic predecessors for Godzilla's rampages.
  As with many movies, one can interpret GODZILLA on a literal or symbolic level.  Symbolically, one can see in the crushed city remains a stark reminder of the consequences of the lethality of nuclear bombs,not so much on the military, but on the scarred bodies of dead and dying women and children. Literally, the movie is a surprisingly effective feast for the eye and the ear.  You would think that a rampaging outsized Tyrannosaurus Rex would be little more than a creature to behold in all its fury and then run from that sight.  And certainly the fear-drenched residents of Tokyo see it and run, only to find that there is no place for them to run.  But what is often overlooked in analyses of the movie is director Inoshiro Honda's innovative wedding of sound to sight.  The opening scene as the credits flash on the screen radiate a strange howling shriek of a creature that has since been caricatured to the point that it now seems worthy of note only as the bubbling babbling of some disrespecting and disrespected guy in a cheap rubber suit.  But if the viewer can somehow disassociate himself from these pathetic future wailings, then the banshee shriek of the monster can be appreciated for what it is: a warning cry to an unsuspecting world that an old enemy with new power is about to make an unexpected entrance.  This focus on noise allied with sight can now be seen as the movie's central metaphor.  In the initial destruction of the freighter to the later demolition of the pleasure boat in Tokyo harbor the viewer can hear but cannot see Godzilla.  On Odo Island itself, as the creature smashes his way from one end of the island to the other, all you can see of it is a fragmentary glimpse of its trailing tail, all the while your ears are being hammered with a cacophony of storm winds and a warning bell rung by a panic-stricken islander.  Later as Steven Martin, played by Raymond Burr with as near an absence of facial expression as I have ever seen from any actor, and a band of curious villagers climb the hill on Odo Island, director Honda wisely continues to build suspense, first by letting us hear the creature, then permitting us to see only its oversized head.  Godzilla's retreating footsteps punctuate a cadence of future city stomping resonances that will be repeated each time it appears on screen.
  The middle part of the movie shows how helpless man is to defeat this lumbering leviathan.  The chosen weapons of the city's defender's are as loud as they are useless.  The ra-ta-ta-ting of machine guns merely hurts the viewer more than the creature.  The snapping and crackling of the half-million volts of electricity ringing the city do little more than play a funeral dirge.  One of the most graphic combinations of sight and sound that I have ever seen in any monster movie occurs when Godzilla is approaching an iron tower as tall as he is. On the tower is a Japanese news reporter excitedly shouting into his microphone, trying desperately to report to the world the advance of this creature.  As it approaches, his voice rises several octaves to a crescendo of panic.  Then, in a startling display of photographic camera bulb flashing and popping, Godzilla faces what seems nothing less than a fusillade of paparazzi collectively taking his picture, with each pop of the camera accompanied by what sounds like gunshots.  Godzilla does not hesitate, he attacks the tower, biting it in two. As the tower collapses, the viewer witnesses the collapse from the perspective of the reporter, with the ground rushing up to meet him in a death call.
  The final third of the movie details the destruction of Godzilla, using the oxygen destroyer.  As one of the two Japanese divers triggers the mechanism underwater, you not only can see Godzilla get ripped apart you can actually hear his death knell as he surfaces one more time to roar out his defiance for a last time.
  GODZILLA is an often overlooked masterpiece of cinematic monster-making, more so despite the cheesy and primitive special effects then avaliable.  The movie succeeds in reaching the inner core of audience that has been long conditioned to view a menace using only the sense of sight.

937587,5,6304899963,"The title pretty much says it all.  Indeed, Godzilla is king of the monsters.  This is in many ways the greatest of the Godzilla movies, particularly those of the original series.  This first film was unique; indeed, some may not realize just how serious-minded a movie this was.  The theme of this movie can clearly be seen as an indictment of the use of nuclear weapons; the images of a devastated Tokyo bespeak themselves closely of the real-life scenes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the atomic bombs dropped on those cities.  Coming just over a decade after the end of World War II, the message condemning nuclear proliferation is understandable and easily understood.  Nuclear tests gave birth to Godzilla, unleashing a havoc that proved all but impossible to contain.  Only a scientific miracle of sorts and a good bit of luck saved Tokyo (and presumably the rest of the world) from the unspeakable horror unleashed by man's experiments with a weapon of mass destruction.
We tend to see Godzilla now in comical terms, due largely to later films starring the big lizard, but the debut of Godzilla must truly have seemed horrific to film audiences in the 1950s.  The monster's first appearance, as his head rises up over the crest of a hill, is very well conceived and impressively presented.  For the most part, the special effects in this film are excellent.  The fact that this movie is in black and white helps a great deal in this regard, I believe.  In no way does Godzilla appear as a man wearing a rubber suit; the face and mouth seemed particularly well done and realistic to me, and I was most impressed by the way the creature's eyes seemed to bug out at times.  There was one scene involving a helicopter being blown over that bespoke the word ""model,"" but everything else, especially Godzilla's destructive march through Tokyo, seemed very well done and quite realistic enough for me.  Not until the new Godzilla series of the 1990s would the monster look so monstrous.  The music is very well done and adds much to the atmosphere of horror evoked by the destruction and menace of the monster.
I have not seen the original Japanese version of the movie, but I imagine it would be even better than the Americanized version featuring Raymond Burr.  For the most part, Burr's insertions into the film were well done and presented no continuity problems.  It does seem strange that an American, and a reporter at that, should so easily be taken into the confidence of Japan's military and scientific leaders, but this feeling is quite assuaged by the knowledge that young boys, no matter how annoying they might be, are commonly given the same privilege in a spate of later Japanese monster movies.  Burr's acting is a little overdramatic after he is injured, and he tends to look like a prop smoking a pipe in many of the scenes leading up to the climax, but I cannot bring myself to give this movie less than five stars.  I am sure, however, that the original Japanese version is much better and much more powerful, especially in the anti-nuclear message it evokes.  It is unfortunate that American distributors apparently chose to remove a number of images they viewed as too uncomfortable for Cold War audiences.",1003104000,3,3235,4.775583482944345

937590,3,6304899963,"Since the first time I saw the movie on television during the late 60's I have found it frightening. Produced and released in Japan in 1954, this was Toho Studios first entry in the giant-monster genre, their answer to the West's ""Giant Behemoth"" and ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". With a production budget of close to the U.S. equivalent of one million dollars (a large expenditure for a Japanese movie in those years), Toho created what was to become an international ""classic"". Instead of using the popular stop-motion technique, they chose to employ an actor in a monster suit, miniature buildings and ships, and a large water tank from which they were able to create an effect of considerable realism. The fact that this movie was shot in black-and-white, along with Akira Ifubuke's dramatic music score, created a very errie and gloomy quality to the film. Considering the available technology, the special effects, overall, are pretty good. One major flaw is the use of odd and different-looking puppets of Godzilla's upperbody and head. There are at least three with distinctly different looks... one with oddly-focused eyes... seen primarily when he sprays his atomic breath. There are also some scenes in which the composite photography is sloppy (especially compared to later Toho films)...understandable considering this was the studio's first attempt at making such a motion picture. There were, however, several impressive sfx scenes. I'm sure there was much trial-and-error and learning going on with the special effects crew. Overall, the American version (originally released in the U.S. in 1956), with the inserted footage of Raymond Burr, is fairly well-done and blends in well with the Japanese version. My general impression of the film, after having seen it many times over the years, is that it is more creepy and suspenseful than any other description I can use. I do not consider this movie to be one of the best of the series, but was a fine initial effort by the studio and certainly ""set the stage"" for the many Toho monster films to follow.",992217600,5,2067,5.046783625730995

937634,5,6304899963,"This is it, people.  The landmark film that started the Japanese sci-fi  phenomenon.  Let's set the record straight, this movie isn't for everyone.  We should admit that some viewers would dismiss this film as  unsophisticated, juvenile, and even a little silly.  The basic story was  freely borrowed from American ""monster on the loose"" films of the  1950s (e.g. ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"").  The special  effects are primitive, to say the least.  For this reviewer, however, there  is a soberness and subtlety to this movie that raises it above the crowd,  and more than compensates the viewer for its faults.  This film can be  taken as an allegory of the atomic bomb, and the destruction and suffering  it inflicted on Japan.  The dark, moody B&W photography and the  atmospheric music blend effectively with the grim visual images of a  monstrous creature of sheer radioactive force that inflicts death and  destruction on much of Tokyo.  An emotionally powerful segment is the day  after Godzilla's fiery night attack on Tokyo.  While the viewer sees the  mass destruction and listens to the screaming victims, a memorial service  with a children's choir singing a funeral dirge is heard in the background.  This frames the key scene showing Ogata and a tearful Emiko persuading Dr.  Serizawa to use his oxygen destroyer against Godzilla.  There is poignancy  in this scene, and especially in Serizawa's inner anguish, that is uniquely  Japanese (in this Mid-Westerner's opinion).  This type of emotion is rare  in a ""monster movie.""  The American version of this movie has  scenes spliced in featuring Raymond Burr as an American reporter.  These  extra scenes create some choppy continuity, but the overall serious tone is  not compromised.  Japanese sci-fi films eventually developed a  chuckle-headed, self-mocking quality that diminished their stature.  These  later films are fun in their own way, but this film is an opportunity to  view a serious sci-fi film from TOHO Studios.  ""Godzilla, King of the  Monsters"" and the original ""Rodan"" film are without question  the best of the Japanese sci-fi films.  Recommended viewing for  ""monster movie"" aficionados.",965174400,2,2177,5.2128279883381925
937635,4,6304899963,"Most people overlook the morals to movies like Godzilla. Sure,it's an old japanese b-movie starring a man in a rubber suit, butthere's a deep seeded moral to the tale of the dinosaur who survived brutal nuclear levels only to survive and wreak havoc on the very beings who created him, and the only true monsters: Humans. My favorites in the whole series are Godzilla, King of the mosters; Godzilla(1985), and Godzilla(1998). These teach the strongest message: When you harm mother nature, she retaliates. In the case of the first movie, nature responds to nuclear testing (see Godzilla vs.  King Ghidora(1992)for this interesting background story) on a remote island by sparing one of the island's inhabitants, a Godzillasaur who has lived peacefully on the island for many eons, and changing him into her own Dark Warrior. Godzilla is not evil. It is the prevailer of good. Mankind is the only true enemy for harming the very Nature that created it. The monster appeared first back in 1944 to destroy the city of Tokyo and to teach the humans to respect mother nature. The pitiful little humans fell before this titan of justice like small flies. The humans eventually destroyed the monster not with firepower, but with knowledge of how Nature itself works on living things. Just for the record, no corpse was ever found. None of the sequels in the original series stuck to that formula, Nature vs man.  Instead, the introduced silly monsters and made Godzilla the good guy......so I don't consider them true sequels. The only TRUE sequel is Godzilla(1985) and an acceptable movie bearing that name came out in 1998.  The theme was the same: Man screws with his creator. Man's creator makes monster. Monster kills man. Man finally stops monster. The monster in that movie wasn't really the same monster from the japanese movies, but the morals remained and there is a lesson to be learned. Godzilla is not a monster, it is a force of good. So stop rooting for mankind and start rooting for the good guy. GO, GODZILLA, GO!",964483200,,2023,4.857971014492754

If you want the better of the  two Black and Whites, with it's less than believable, but more than  unbelievable solution, see Godzilla Raids Again.
Godzilla, King of the  Monsters was not a remake of the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms for two reasons.  1.  Inoshiro Honda had production of a movie he was working on cut, so he  had to find a quick replacement.  He first thought of a giant octopuss, but  he went with the the giant lizard situation instead.  2.  Many people  believe the American Godzilla was the remake of the Beast from 20,000  Fathoms.

Don't get me wrong, Raymond Burr is just fine in his role  as the American reporter who must narrate the action, and the recutting of  this movie for American audiences is actually deft and clever most of the  time.  However, the original Japanese version--""Gojira""--is  positively sublime.  The most believable Godzilla of all is the first one,  in stark black & white documentary-style photography.  I could go into  entensive detail about everything concerning this movie, but that is best  left to several excellent books that have hit the market recently (such as  ""Monsters Are Attacking Tokyo!"" and ""Japan's Favorite  Mon-Star"").  Instead, I'll wrap up with this brief summation: not only  is ""Godzilla"" the very first Godzilla movie, or even the first  Japanese giant monster movie.  It is the point where many aspects of  today's Japanese pop culture were born: Godzilla blazed the trail for the  many who would follow.

Then a monster appears, people run in panic. Was Godzilla a relic from the Jurassic Age? How did it reappear today? Did Strontium 90 cause this?

Amiko visits a scientist who has a fish tank. and a secret. Navy ships drop explosives into the sea to destroy the monster. Then Godzilla appears inside of Tokyo Harbor! The military responds. The 400 foot tall Godzilla walks ashore and destroys buildings by the waterfront. People are evacuated for safety. Godzilla walks out of Tokyo Bay, the Army fires cannons at the creature. High tension wires cant stop it. Its breath causes fires. Nothing can stop it! Armored vehicles cant stop it and are destroyed. There is a wall of flames in Tokyo. Godzilla continues its destruction! Buildings collapse. People watch helplessly. Jet airplanes fire rockets at Godzilla. Wounded people are taken to hospitals. What can be done to stop the monster? What if the oxygen in the water was destroyed? This is a tough decision for the scientist. Divers go beneath the sea to search for Godzilla and kill the monster. The poison is released in the water, the monster expires.

This is at best an average story. How did a lack of oxygen in the water affect an air-breathing reptile? Godzilla symbolizes the horror of atomic bombs that destroyed people and buildings; or the fire-bombing that also did the same. The story of a monster from the sea goes back over a thousand years to Beowulf. The movie Jaws was a better movie; it was based on a true story from the Jersey Shore in 1916. Close to Shore by Michael Capuzzo is one book about this event.",1515456000,,2464,4.738927738927739

In this black and white movie from 1956 Burr not only plays the part of a reporter 'Steve Martin', but he is also the narrator throughout the movie.  I think Burr did a great job in this movie and I really enjoyed the plot and the way it all played out.  I think it is a must have for all those who enjoy Godzilla movies and even movies staring Raymond Burr.",1507248000,,440,4.0344827586206895
7878869,4,6304899963,"PLOT: Godzilla terrorizes Tokyo 4 STARS~

1954 and the sleeping giant Godzilla begins terrorizing an island. American Reporter~ Steve Martin (RAYMOND BURR) is there for the scoop. In a series of ship sinks complete with severe burns the dying men claim it was Godzilla. Godzilla ends up in Tokyo Bay and decides Tokyo is next. Complete with fire breath. Tanks, machine guns, cannon fire but nothing phases him. He tears through a defense grid of high tension wires and soon Tokyo is ablaze. Reporter Martin watches this from the top floor of the news building. Is there anything that can stop Monster Godzilla? This is one of the better versions. The original all Japanese version is ""edited"" and they ADDED Raymond Burr with clever edits. Then english dubbing. Over all it is very well done. The special effects are pretty good for the age of the movie. ADDED fun is stone faced Burr trying to show terror.....I saw this as a young person......over 40 years ago and it was good to see it again.",1496534400,,995,4.718390804597701

This ""Americanized"" version has characters and sets shot in the USA, but they did a remarkable job of blending these in, unlike some awful sci-fi Roger Corman efforts!  Once you are aware of this, you find certain characters in the original version talking to Raymond Burr, but their backs are to the camera -other actors wearing the same outfits.  As the English is all dubbed in, the voices of the fake characters is the same as the originals. It works, and that is all that matters.

So sit back and enjoy!  You may someday want to see the ""pure"" Japanese version, but this is the one Dad or Gramps watched at some matinee!",1493942400,,714,4.419847328244275
