8102378,5,B000DILW8I,"Firstly this is not an Ancient Alien series. West focuses on what he thinks the Egyptians knew/learned, maybe Egyptian sites are much older than we can imagine? The facts used by West are what lay in ruin written on the walls. This video gives more credit to ancient humans than simply saying ancient aliens showed us everything we know. If you look deeper you can assume that humans actually applied what we learned, yet for some reason have slipped to the spiritual state we are in today.  Knowledge learned from aliens or not this is a excellent and educational video series.  This series goes so deep it can easily go over the head of a person who is a fan of the traditional Egypt that is taught in schools. On the other hand if you listen with an open mind, you can learn a great deal from these videos.",1362355200,12,809,4.422818791946309
8102379,1,B000DILW8I,"I believe in the ""Ancient Alien"" theory, but this DVD set doesn't provide info or details about anything. It is poorly directed and produced. It just professes a secret mystery that it never seems to outline. It is surprisingly bad considering that it features John Anthony West. If you want to explore alternative theories on Ancient Egypt, see ""The Mystery of the Sphinx"" DVD hosted by Charlton Heston (get the expanded director's cut), and ""The Pyramid Code"" DVD by Carmen Boulter. Both of these DVD's feature the theories of John Anthony West, but in a professional production. They are clear, concise and to the point. If you want to explore the mysteries of consciousness and religion, get anything by Joseph Campbell, and pick up ""The Great Year"" DVD by Walter Cruttenden.",1317081600,5,779,4.9541984732824424
