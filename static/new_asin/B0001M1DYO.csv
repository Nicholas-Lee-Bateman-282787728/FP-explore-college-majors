2013521,5,B0001M1DYO,"I have trouble getting motivated to begin an exercise program.  I have tried yoga - forget it - even though it says ""for beginners"" you have to already be in shape.  Richard Simmons has always been for US - His videos are do-able and they make you feel good.  Richard is an inspiration to all of us that have difficulty in the area of weight and fitness. We can do it!",1169078400,13,368,4.154929577464789
2013522,5,B0001M1DYO,"As a former professional massage therapist, this is the tape I use every day whether I also workout or not.  Much the same way I take a multi-vitamin every day to make sure my body's minimum daily needs are met, this is the minimum amount of movement everyone should get each day.  It's not hard, doesn't take long, and will make you feel gently better.  It's great by itself on a rest-day, or for an extended cool-down from aerobic or anaerobic exercise.  (Also, since there is no talking (just music), you may turn the sound all the way off if you want to do it while someone is asleep in the next room.)",1146614400,18,606,4.336283185840708
2013523,5,B0001M1DYO,"I also love it. I do it in the morning. That's when I'm grumpy and stiff. This one video has helped me snap out of my morning depression. Thank you, Richard!",1133568000,11,157,4.096774193548387
2013524,5,B0001M1DYO,I just love this video!  It is so relaxing.  I do this tape every night before I go to bed and it makes me feel so good!!! I would recommend this video to anyone who has general aches and pains associated with getting older.,1122422400,20,224,4.068181818181818

2013526,5,B0001M1DYO,Terrific for someone with muscle and bone problems.  Can take it easy or really give a good workout,1453420800,,99,4.5
2013527,4,B0001M1DYO,"This is still the best easy morning stretch I've ever used (I have arthritis), and I like the tunes. Wore out my old VHS and had to replace it. Wish it was available in DVD.",1451692800,,173,3.9714285714285715

2013529,5,B0001M1DYO,Richard's tapes are always excellent! Nice to get one that I didn't have. Came quick and was in good shape.,1445126400,,107,4.4

2013531,5,B0001M1DYO,"I was soooo happy to have tracked down this tape.  I had it back in the 90's and somewhere along the line I lost it (maybe it dies on me????).

Anyhow, been looking for it for a few years.  Sadly it never made it to DVD.  I used to use it DAILY before going to work 'cause it helped the whole ""waking up"" experience (LOL).

I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It was delivered very quickly.  The tape is in excellent condition.  Plays well (I have a combo DVD / VHS tape player).

Just as I remembered it and have again started using it every morning (it only takes 15 minutes).  Wakes up the muscles very gently.  Gets the cob webs out.  Addresses every muscle including fingers, hands, wrists, shoulder, upper/lower body.... list goes on.)

And finally, let's be honest.... there's good old Richard himself.  He just cracks me up and always manages to make me smile (which isn't an easy thing to do first thing in the morning... lol).

AND...  as even he says on the cover of this tape... he doesn't say a SINGLE word on this tape which must have been torture to him (LOL).

Always was and always will be a really great stretch / wake me up tape.

Am actually looking into how much it would cost to have it converted onto DVD 'cause I'm afraid it might eventually die.  THAT is how  much I love it.!!!",1436140800,,1302,4.258196721311475
2013532,5,B0001M1DYO,"I rcvd it in a very timely manner WAY sooner than was expected and even put a smiley face on the envelope with ""Enjoy"" written on the back. A nice special touch  people don't do that much anymore it was a nice change of pace.",1430265600,,225,4.0

2013541,5,B0001M1DYO,"It's a great 15-minute exercise program.  Different stretching exercises are demonstrated along with different classical music pieces. My wife and I have used this for years.  We started with, and still use, the program on VHS tape; this is our third tape because we wore out the others.  I'm sure it would be just as good on DVD.",1409961600,,330,4.655172413793103

2013544,5,B0001M1DYO,I wore out my first copy.  Love this as a warm-up before doing other exercises.,1405987200,,79,4.266666666666667
2013545,5,B0001M1DYO,The retreat house I attend uses this to stretch each morning. It's a great way to start a retreat day. The music is beautiful; peaceful & calming.,1403222400,,146,4.444444444444445

2013547,5,B0001M1DYO,"Although a little  ol' school, as It is a VHS tape,( I would have preferred DVD, ) but as I have a VHS / DVD player it works;  Nice when you need gentle stretching, works for the older set too!",1401148800,,193,3.8
2013548,5,B0001M1DYO,Streching is great. And streching to the classics with Richard Simmons is really great. It is the great to do the stretching to such great music.,1397260800,,145,4.615384615384615
2013549,5,B0001M1DYO,"This has been my ""go to"" exercise video since 2008.  After every surgery ( I've had eight in the past five years.), I start back to exercising with ""Stretching to the Classics"" --- sometimes as little as a week after a major surgery.  Even when not recovering from surgery, I start and end my exercise session with ""Stretching to the Classics"".  I now own four copies and am always on the look out for another copy so that I will never be without it.  I love it!!!",1395360000,,464,4.2988505747126435
2013550,2,B0001M1DYO,I thought the item said DVD  but I received it in VHS.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe the description wasn't clear.,1392768000,,120,4.363636363636363
2013551,1,B0001M1DYO,This is the weirdest exercise video I've purchased and I've purchased LOTS of them!  It's very hard to follow and he changes from move to move before you can even figure out what he's doing so you can follow it.  It only runs about 15 minutes so it definitely isn't worth the amount I paid for it.  I've only used this twice because it's not worth wasting the limited amount of time I have.  I'll be donating this one to Goodwill for sure!  I've bought a couple of his others and they are better than this but if you want a good workout that is easy to follow try any of Leslie Sansone's walking workouts.  She has a huge variety and they are the best that I've found out of all the exercise videos that I've purchased over the years.,1391558400,,734,4.207142857142857
2013552,5,B0001M1DYO,"This is one of the best stretch tapes I have ever done.  I laughed the first time I saw Richard Simmons in a Maxfield Parish painting but after that I love it!  The music is classics, the moves are good and you feel good when you are done.  I used this both as a warm up and cool down and just by itself.  My friend purchased this and I thought it was the DVD.  Unfortunately it arrived as a VHS and I just didn't return it.
Amazon, if this ever gets put to DVD I will be the first to purchase.",1390521600,3,494,3.8514851485148514
2013553,5,B0001M1DYO,"I love this stretching video because of the simple stretches Richard makes, but surprisingly you feel afterwards, more than you would think. The beautiful classical music makes me forget where I am and glide into relaxation.",1389225600,,224,5.25
2013554,5,B0001M1DYO,"Satisfied with the moves and exercise level of this dvd. Richard Simons is the move guru. He has done his homework with this dvd as I'm over 60 and can't do all those aerobic moves I used to teach. If you need to move gently, this is really the dvd to order. Love Richard. . .",1386720000,,276,3.9464285714285716

2013556,3,B0001M1DYO,"The tape's color is poor...it's as if one turned up the color as high as it will go so the picture is distorted.  On the other hand, it is viewable and Richard's stretches are very good and easy to follow and do.",1383868800,,212,4.0476190476190474
2013557,5,B0001M1DYO,"Wow!  I have always respected Richard Simmons as an expert in how to get and stay healthy.  It was wonderful to find this product available in any format.  The routine is gentle, the movements are easy to follow.  I say, ""Go for it!"".  The vendor filled my order quickly and professionally.  I'd use them again.",1366329600,,311,4.5636363636363635
2013558,5,B0001M1DYO,"this is a work out that is made for all, and there is no talking or you must do this or you must do that, just music and smiles; I am limited in what I can do and this is a good work-out to classicial music, slow paced and just completey wonderful, this is my second one, the first I just flat wore out, but I do love it so and was so thankful I could get another. I would reccomend this to all. if the standing is too much, you can sit and do what you can and smile along",1365638400,,472,3.6831683168316833
2013559,5,B0001M1DYO,"This is the best video!  Would recommend to others that have arthritis.  No kneeling, getting on the floor. Movements are slow an work the joints without the stress on them like other exercise videos.",1363564800,,200,4.852941176470588
2013560,5,B0001M1DYO,My first Richard Simmons workout was on an album which I still own. I also have his walking cassette tapes & his Sweatin' VHS tapes. (I just recently upgraded to the DVDs.) I love this video because it can be used anytime. I've used it on it's own & after other workout videos. I find that other videos don't give me an adequate cool down & stretch & this does the trick. Been searching for DVD format with no luck. Anyone know if it's out there?,1358553600,,446,4.1976744186046515
2013561,5,B0001M1DYO,"This is a perfect video for those who would like a cooldown from a regular workout, or just stretching. It is SO relaxing, especially after a stressful day. I use it over and over. My only complaint is that it hasn't been released on DVD yet.",1349308800,5,242,4.282608695652174
2013562,5,B0001M1DYO,Great stretch - good to relax to. I use this in the morning to get the kinks out. You'll like it too.,1344124800,,101,3.6363636363636362
2013563,5,B0001M1DYO,Beautiful music . i was so relaxed after doing. i just recently bought and have used 3 times already. its great!,1343520000,,112,4.380952380952381
2013564,5,B0001M1DYO,This is a great tape. I love Richard anyway but this really is nice to stretch with and I love the classical music with it. You won't regret getting this.,1343347200,2,154,4.166666666666667
2013565,5,B0001M1DYO,"I bought this video to use at work for employees to stretch and warm up before some physical training. It is low impact and allows you to gently stretch the muscles in every area of your body. It worked well for people of all ages. I liked the fact that you can effectively stretch without having to get down on the floor. Very important if you do not have an exercise mat or have typical aches and pains to contend with. I would recommend this video to anyone who wants a gentle, effective way to stretch and stay limber. Would be good to use in the mornings to start your day and also wind down and relax at the end of the day.",1323129600,2,629,4.121951219512195
2013566,5,B0001M1DYO,Still a valid product. One that would benefit seniors trying to stay in shape as it is able to be done and effective. The price was a bargain.,1314316800,,142,4.107142857142857
2013567,5,B0001M1DYO,"I was so pleased with my purchase.  It arrived in good time and was in perfect shape.  It was the first time that I ordered from Amazon, but am sure I will do it again.",1289260800,,168,3.7714285714285714
2013568,5,B0001M1DYO,"There are many reasons why I enjoy this workout.  First, it is filled with beautiful classical music that helps you relax right away.  I also appreciate that it does not have any floor work at all.  I have a bad back and floor routines cause me to stiffen up and experience pain.  This is all done standing with a few exercises in a chair.  Another thing I have noticed is I do not get knee pain during or after this routine, likely because it is so gentle.  It may be a mild routine, but I still notice the benefits of the stretches throughout the day.  Those of you who do not care for Simmons's exuberance will like the fact that he does not say a single word on this video.  Another great feature is that it only takes 15 minutes so it is easy to fit into the busiest of days.
Additionally,  The exercises will take you from head to toe, gently stretching each body part.  After doing this routine for a couple weeks I started adding resistance to my movements and a few more repetitions.
If you are looking for a soothing stretching routine, here it is.  One drawback is that it is only on VHS.",1279584000,8,1099,4.260869565217392
2013569,4,B0001M1DYO,"Fine for pre-walk, but not used as often as other, more heart-pumping videos for exercise.",1238976000,,90,5.066666666666666
2013570,5,B0001M1DYO,"This is a great, relaxing workout.  There is absolutely no talking, just beautiful classical music.  The stretching is easy to do, but you still feel like you've done something afterward.",1232496000,,187,5.2
2013571,5,B0001M1DYO,"Love this video.  Richard Simmons doesn't talk at all, which makes it even better.  I only wish it were available on dvd.",1231200000,2,121,4.454545454545454
2013572,5,B0001M1DYO,"This is a great stretch, and something we all want as we age. I don't think you can hurt yourself doing it, yet we all want the flexibility this tape offers.

Every time I do it, I come out refreshed and energized, but from relaxing, not from working hard.

Since he doesn't speak at all in this video, you can enjoy it whether you like him or hate him. While it may not change your body shape, it offers instant gratification. Do it once and you'll be hooked.",1227052800,3,460,4.215909090909091
2013573,5,B0001M1DYO,"This video is the perfect way for me to ease into my day.  I get up, put on the coffee, then pop in ""Stretchin' To The Classics"".  The music is soothing and the stretching takes away that morning stiffness.  By the time the tape is over 15 minutes later, I feel calm and limber.  And, my coffee is just finishing.

I also use it sometimes in the evening when I get the urge to snack.  Popping in this tape gives me 15 minutes to let go of that urge and replace it with a different type of feel-good.

The fact that there is no talking, just music, in this tape makes it particularly soothing.  The moves are learned quickly without cueing because they are slow.

I have successfully used Richard's tapes for years beginning with the original ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" from 1988. After countless playings, my old tape still works beautifully -- amazing!  I can always count on his tapes to take off those extra few pounds that creep on when I am not looking.

I highly recommend this tape especially if you like classical music!",1181174400,6,1026,4.433155080213904
2013574,5,B0001M1DYO,"The more I use it (every morning) the more I love it. It is a full stretch but simple and easy, although very effective. He does not say a word in it but the music is lovely and it is completely easy to follow. It takes only about 15 or so minutes and is a complete stretch for every part of the body (even parts you wouldn't think of) and is wonderfully done.",1180051200,8,360,3.9452054794520546
8014318,5,B0001M1DYO,I want people to know that Sam's Club offers changing a VHS tape to DVD. I would do it soon because someone just purchased the rights to all of Richard Simmons merchandise. I sent my VHS tape in a week ago because at the time no one had the rights to Richard Simmons merchandise. This stretch video is fantastic. I use it 6 days a week before I exercise. I purchased 2 because I was afraid of the VHS tape would not last.,1491868800,2,421,4.0843373493975905
