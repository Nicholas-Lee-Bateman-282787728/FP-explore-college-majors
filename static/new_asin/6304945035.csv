7879918,5,6304945035,"Treasures of the Earth (3-pack) is worth the 4-6 week special order for anyone (or woman in my case) interested in gems and jewelry.

It's a Discovery Channel video and with most videos from Discovery Channel, it's very informative and lavishly produced. The recreations in stage set and costumes are (Rome 1st Century, Egyptian pharaohs, etc) almost as if it's a Hollywood production.

Discovery Channel went on scene and on location to many places in the world. Photos of the famous and actual gems are filmed. You really see (live) what they're talking about. If it's talking about history, it's recreated using props, actors, and sets that look very real.

* Diamonds: You will see the Hope diamond, South Africa diamond mines, the largest flawless diamond in the world, Diamond Exchange, cutting a large diamond, DeBeers history, and a history of diamond mining and selling

* Gold: This shows you the underground diamond mines of South Africa, India's love with gold and its 22K gilded temple, the 1842 gold rush, gold design, and a gold production center where gold bars are made.

* Pearls and Amber: A historical narrative of Mikimoto cultured pearls but also includes natural Persian Gulf pearls. You will see both harvest areas and the process of making cultured pearls. Amber takes you to the caves and shores where amber is collected. Also includes history of the Russian ""Amber Room"" and how amber was used during the Crusades and in Roman times.

This collection will dazzle the eyes as well as inform the mind. Great for educational purposes, geology classes, moms, girlfriends, wives, or anyone fascinated with gems, jewelry, and history.

52 minutes each tape. C 1997. Compares very favorably with National Geographic's 1991 ""Splendid Stones,"" but covers gold and amber and goes in-depth a more and takes you to many areas never seen before like the mines and production centers.",1105574400,3,1897,5.022292993630574
