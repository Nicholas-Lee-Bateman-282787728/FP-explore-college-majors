That said, despite the fact that his name is on the show, he doesn't actually perform. Instead, he helped to curate the list of comedians who appear. The Alternative Comedy Experience is like one of those old Comedy Central shows, like Premium Blend or Comic Remix, which split up the sets of a number of different comedians, show one bit at a time, then cut over to the next. Each episode is around 23 minutes long and features six or seven comics. The editing keeps the pacing moving quite well. The show is filmed at the Stand, a well-known Edinburgh comedy club, and the idea is to give the feeling of sitting in a club and watching a night full of comics doing wildly different 10-minute sets.

Unless you're very well-versed in modern British comedy, odds are good that you'll never have heard of any of the comics. Among the better-known of the participants in Season One are Josie Long, Boothby Graffoe, Andy Zaltzman (who did the Bugle podcast with John Oliver), Alun Cochrane, Robin Ince, and Lee's wife Bridget Christie, but nearly everyone is hilarious. Among the true standouts are David Kay, a slow-talking Scottish comic whose ""Identity Theft"" bit is nearly worth the price of admission in its own right.

Many of the comics showcased here are longtime performers at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and the atmosphere is freewheeling: there are musical acts (Graffoe, Isy Suttie, David O'Doherty), surrealists (Tony Law and Sam Simmons), political satirists (Zaltzman and Paul Sinha), and brilliant Scottish and Irish standups like Stephen Carlin, Eleanor Tiernan, and Maeve Higgins who were it even possible may be even less well known in America than the Brits in the lineup.

If you're an open-minded comedy nerd, this is a really brilliant set. Check out Season 2, too. (Make sure that you have the ability to play Region 2 DVDs. And make sure to check the prices on amazon.co.uk, because they may well be lower.)",1481846400,,2024,4.84393063583815
