3588831,5,B001FT4PF6,This is a must see collection worthy of your personal DVD library but again the powers that be have decided to bring their personal editing abilities to this great series. After reviewing certain episodes I noticed certain parts and music selections had been changed drasticly from the original episodes. This is not worthy of the series and the humor it represented or the powers that be. If you are changing or altering the episodes be honest and tell us.,1241308800,42,457,4.7974683544303796
3588832,5,B001FT4PF6,this is one of the best purchases I have made from amazon. I have waited forever to see this series come out and am so glad that finally I am able to have the complete collection. all duckman fans should own the set!,1237852800,10,216,4.046511627906977

3588834,5,B001FT4PF6,"Forget George Costanza. THIS is Jason Alexander's greatest role ever! With edgy social satire Seinfeld could only dream about, Duckman also puts to shame most of the animated pretenders to the crown.
""The Simpsons""? Well done, but generally plays it too safe.
""Family Guy""? Okay, but tends to ramble and lack cohesion.
The closest current comparison would be to ""South Park"", as far as its no-holds-barred assault on the hypocrisy and pretensions of modern society.
Definitely not for the kids, Duckman still holds up well, years after his untimely demise.",1234137600,10,556,5.188888888888889
3588835,5,B001FT4PF6,It took way too long for this to become available. The whole series is great. I had some minor skips on the first two seasons discs on my ps2. It's worth noting that the machine does that from time to time and I haven't had a problem on the third or fourth seasons or since the fist couple skips so it's not really an issue.,1233187200,,324,4.0
3588836,5,B001FT4PF6,"The Duckman seasons 1 and 2 were released in Septemeber and before I could buy them a ""complete"" four season pack was announced. So i pre-ordered it and all it is is a bundle of the 2 releases. There isn't even a box to keep them together. On the plus side you save about $15 buying them this way but if you bought seasons 1 and 2 when they came out just buy seasons 3 and 4. Back to the show,when this came on on the mid-ninties it was one of the funniest shows on TV.Jason Alexender is amazing and the other voice talent is spot on. This show was very underated problably because it was on the USA network who were only knowed for reruns,WWF and shows like Up All Night. This show holds up petty well to the test of time but some of the references are dated and some of the ""in jokes"" were hard to pick up at the time. Since this show hasn't been seen in reruns and most likely won't for a long time it is a great DVD buy to add to a collection and I doubt any more releases will follow.",1231286400,28,989,3.9748743718592965

3588869,5,B001FT4PF6,"The original DVDs were known for lacking the Zappa comedic stings, particularly the episode Psyche. I'm happy to say that this DVD release easily fixes that. As for the quality of the show, what can I say that hasn't already been said in a more concise way? It's the '90s animated comedy as high quality as peak Simpsons, and tragically overlooked.

This collection is humorous only in microcosm.  Taken as a whole, it describes somebody, rendered as an animated duck in this case, placed in an impossible situation, thrown together with characters not of his choosing from whom he can never escape, kept from the great desire of his life by a cold, conspiring world and the aforesaid characters.  Would not we ourselves act in the same way if we were in his situation?  But then, my friends tell me I always over-analyze things.",1465689600,14,653,4.846846846846847

3588883,5,B001FT4PF6,"Duckman is probably the greatest cartoon ever to come out of the 1990's.  I discovered it in the late 90's whilst channel surfing.  his irreverent humor, sarcasm and opinion of the opposite sex will have you rolling on the floor.  Despite all of his inadequacies, he is still a dedicated family man.  One of my favorite moments watching Duckman is where he declares ""I'm clearing my calendar of everything"".  A closeup of his calendar reveals that on every page there is only one notation:  TOUCH MYSELF.  Trust me, Duckman will not disappoint",1441152000,2,543,4.836956521739131

3588906,4,B001FT4PF6,Gave me a chance to see all the episodes. I had forgotten how colorful the series was and how it made a point without using the heavy handed approach so popular in sitcoms.,1401580800,2,172,4.242424242424242
3588907,5,B001FT4PF6,"Back when Duckman originally ran, I was always thrilled when I could find an episode on TV (it seemed like it never aired at the same time two weeks in a row), and I used to watch re-runs whenever I could find them, but I knew there were a lot of episodes that I had missed.  So it's really good to have this DVD set of the complete series.

As others have pointed out, the ""Four Season Pack"" is just the seasons 1&2 set and the seasons 3&4 set held together with some shrink wrap, but somehow that fits in perfectly with the Duckman universe - it's like Duckman himself half-assedly put the thing together.  Some reviews have mentioned that the music was changed or dropped due to rights issues - I didn't really notice any glaring problems, although some of the episodes sounded a little ""off"" - you could tell that the soundtrack had been redone.  On the plus side, the Frank Zappa music that I remembered popping up a lot (especially in the first season) is still there.  As is the awesome theme song.

Whenever I hear Jason Alexander, I don't think of Sinfield - he'll always be Duckman to me.  His delivery of the title character's frequent rants and off-handedly offensive comments was perfect.

Duckman was not just one of the best animated shows I've ever seen, it's one of the best comedies, period.  Every episode has at least one or two bits that will literally make you laugh out loud, and sometimes the good stuff is so rapid-fire that you have to rewind and watch it again in order to get everything, which is why watching it on DVD is nice.  It's also good to see the entire series in sequence so as to pick up on the running jokes and inside references.  I'm kind of glad though that the show ended when it did - it seemed to have run its course.  By the end of the series, they were really reaching for plots, and started falling back on the old sitcom ""fixes"" of transplanting the characters to other locations, doing parodies of famous movies, doing musical episodes, etc.  Not that the later episodes were bad, but they definitely moved further and further from the basic premise of the show during that last season.

But even if you've never seen the show, these DVDs are well worth picking up if you're a fan of animated comedies - just keep in mind that the show was mostly intended for an adult audience.",1398902400,3,2329,4.436619718309859
3588908,4,B001FT4PF6,"The show is equal parts raunchy, absurdist, and hilarious. If you took the classic Simpsons and moved them from the suburbs to the grimy city, this is what you'd probably get. Jason Alexander (of Seinfeld fame) is absolutely incredible in bringing the protagonist, Duckman, to life.

That being said, the DVD set suffers a bit in the packaging. While the box art is nice, the DVD cases are very thin and flimsy. When I received my package, the plastic prongs that hold the DVD inside the cases had already broken - allowing the DVD's to bounce around inside. Thankfully, none of the DVD's were scratched. But now, I'm going to have to buy some replacement cases.

Additionally, since this was packaged by CBS, a lot of the music in the show has been removed for copyright reasons (in the same way all the awesome music in MTV's ""Daria"" was removed when they made their DVD's). It's not show-breaking, but a little disappointing.

Those issues aside, I was so incredibly happy to find this series on DVD and to be able to re-watch this classic.",1394755200,6,1043,4.657608695652174
3588909,5,B001FT4PF6,"This set includes all the episodes. There's not much more to say about it then that. The cover is cool, it has everything I want, and everything I expected. Quick shipping also.",1392336000,,177,4.5625

3588912,5,B001FT4PF6,"There is more trenchant social commentary in modern animated series like this than you can ever find on broadcast television or radio.  The episode ""America The Beautiful"" was so poignant that it alone was worth the cost of the set.  It is witty and insightful and I love it.  Such a pity that these can't go on forever.  Watching the last episode was a downer knowing that there would be no more.  Could do without the Fluffy and Uranus torture bits but that was probably put in to appeal to our broadest marketing segment -- 13 year old boys.",1375574400,9,544,4.454545454545454
3588913,4,B001FT4PF6,"Duckman was funny when it was on TV, it has not lost any of that in the last 15 odd years.  Still working my way through it, still enjoying it!",1367280000,,143,3.7666666666666666
3588914,5,B001FT4PF6,"I purchased the complete Duckman Series because I enjoyed the show as a kid watching it on USA Network. Now that I am 31, it is not as interesting or as funny. Still, it is a must-have for anyone that wants to go back to the times where there were no worries and you were just a kid sitting in front of the television enjoying cartoon that you're not supposed to be watching in the first place. I watched every episode from Season 1 to 4 and I will happily add it to my DVD collection next to Beavis & Butt-Head and Rocko's Modern Life.",1362355200,,536,4.114285714285714
3588915,5,B001FT4PF6,"Duckman ran on TV from 1994-97, and if it were still airing, I'd still be watching it. Jason Alexander (Seinfeld's George) is the voice of Duckman and other recognizable talent appear in other regular and guest-appearance characters. Alexander is fantastic with Duckman's rapid-fire tirades. I'd buy this if it came in blu-ray! Coming from the 1990's, and running on the USA Network channel, there may have been some adult topics but it was nothing like the ""filth"" (as in 2 & 1/2 Men) you see on regular TV these days! A great collection to own or give as a gift, especially to someone who likes animation.",1355356800,8,607,4.735849056603773

3588928,5,B001FT4PF6,"There are some very slight differences from the original series that die hard fans might notice. A different song is added to the season 3 episode titled Apocalypse Not. But I would still give it a 5 star rating. The insane duck star gives out great and even wise though insane rants that are forever memorable. What a great series. And like the death of Kenny in the South Park series,. the many killings of the cute stuffed toys called Fluffy and Uranus is also quite enjoyable.",1338768000,3,480,4.528735632183908

3588933,5,B001FT4PF6,"I'd watched a few episodes of Duckman on TV years ago and decided to buy the four season pack. It's hilarious, and Jason Alexander as Duckman does remarkably well not to trip over his tongue with the dialogue. I can't say that I've seen an 'ordinary' episode.  Guest stars also appear on the show, and some also have recurring roles such as Tim Curry as Duckman's nemesis. Really a good laugh, very witty and very cleverly done.",1300665600,2,428,4.558441558441558

When Jason Alexander was at his best as George Costanza, on the USA cable channel came out with what turned out to be, dare I say it, a show funnier then ""The Simpsons"". There, I said it. The only other show that was as funny as ""Duckman"" was probably ""Ren & Stimpy"", the early years. The writing, and delivery of dialog, when Duckman goes on a rampage, he must recite a whole page of dialog, maybe more. And it never fails to be some of the funniest lines ever heard on TV.
