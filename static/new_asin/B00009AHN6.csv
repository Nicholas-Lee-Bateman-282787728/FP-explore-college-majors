7990263,4,B00009AHN6,"The footage in this video comes primarily from 3 shows.
There is Dortmund 1981 & California Jam 2 1978.
Then there is the show where Lou Gramm is wearing a 'Warehouse New Orleans'shirt. Where & when is that footage from? It looks like it might be from the 'Double Vision' tour in 78.
Anybody got any info?",1195344000,,305,4.368421052631579

7990265,5,B00009AHN6,"This DVD reissue/re-release of the 1991 video comes as a welcome breath of fresh air especially in light of the recent release of the ""Live From Deer Creek"" and ""25th Anniversary All-Access"" DVDs. It's not a concert video but rather a tribute/""get-to-know"" documentary of the original band member line-up that produced ALL the famous Foreigner hits (not the current nostalgia/Vegas lounge act touring as Foreigner in recent years). My only complaint about this video documentary is that there wasn't more of it !",1069286400,7,512,5.180722891566265
7990266,5,B00009AHN6,"If you're a Foreigner fan, especially one who admires their early work & original lineups, this DVD reissue of the original 1991 video is an essential part of any Foreigner collection.  It's more a ""Behind The Music"" style documentary than a concert video, but much of the concert video is vintage late 70's footage of the original lineup that can't be found anywhere else.  This footage provides some seldom seen treats, such as getting to watch singer Lou Gramm & original drummer Dennis Elliott performing their late 70's trademark dual drum-solo...something they stopped doing in the 80's.  The interview's include discussions with members no longer in the band, as well as with founder Mick Jones & singer Lou Gramm, and provide a great deal of history & information not covered anywhere else.  Foreigner was never a band to do lots of interviews or engage in self-promotion, preferring to let their music ""do the talking"" instead.  As a result however, many of the millions of listeners who enjoyed & bought their music over the years know very little about the band itself...surprising for a group that's sold over 40 million albums in the U.S. alone.  This DVD provides a very rare glimpse of the individuals behind those major-selling albums & hard-rocking hits, as well as comments from their former manager, Billy Joel & others.  Concert footage covers most of their best known songs, including Feels Like The First Time, Cold As Ice, Hot Blooded, Double Vision, Juke Box Hero & Urgent (filmed at the time each respective song was new, and performed by the same members who recorded the original studio version), as well as featuring the complete video of I Want To Know What Love Is.",1069286400,10,1695,4.905594405594406
