224963,4,6300208192,"Gary Cooper plays an army captain who has gone native, removed himself from the garrison to live on his own private island with the half-breed son by his murdered Indian wife.  Disdaining uniform for more 'primitive' furs, he is described by his onlooking partner in this film as part 'savage'.  He is no Colonel Kurtz, however, but the soundest and bravest of soldiers - his mission is to blow up a fort held by the ruthless Seminole tribe, after releasing the largely Hispanic prisoners, opening the way for Zachary Taylor's army to move in.
Cooper's apparent savagery is contrasted with the narrator, who, opening the film writing his diary, is linked to civilisation and culture.  A genteel gentleman-officer, clean-cut in an absurdly clean uniform, with gleaming rapier by his side, he is next to useless in the wilderness of the film's setting.  Though set in the Everglade swamps of Florida, 'Drums' is a curious mixture of Western and jungle adventure, which the great Raoul Walsh films as a sort of pinball game, large groups chasing or fleeing one another, from left to right and all over the place.
'Drums' has a ridiculous script, leavening cod-poetry and silly historical contextualising with wooden heroics and romance; the acting is generally stiff, not helped by the sharp cuts between location shooting and studio shots.  None of this matters.  If Robert Altman is the master of group interaction, then Walsh is the master of group action, his camera and wave-like editing even faster than the hordes of rushing braves or knackered infantry dotting the film.  His no-nonsense approach, focusing on the narratively pertinent and avoiding the superfluous, merely picturesque or heavily symbolic (the narrator indulges in metaphors, but his poetic pretensions are routinely mocked) does not preclude sequences of great beauty, whether it is Walsh's intense respone to the jungle's rich colours, or the action build-ups framed in dramatic silhouettes.  There are at least three astonishing, creeping pans revealing groups agonisingly waiting for attack or surprise or support or just anything.
The relationship between the hero and Mari Aldon, frankly pert and sexually demanding, catch Cooper at an erotic pitch not seen since his 30s masterpieces with Marlene Dietrich.  In true Wagnerian style, however, this sexual smouldering co-exists with an all-encompassing stench of death.  The film's most memorable images frame unimaginable slaughter - the post-massacre tableau of corpses spread out over the fallen fort, worthy of 'Gone With The Wind'; the skull-crowned burial mounds of the Seminole, once again raising the future spectre of 'Apocalypse Now'; their death pits of crocodile swamps, victims only revealed by their floating hats; the breathtaking underwater stand-off between Cooper and his rival Chief.  The racism of the film, and a narrative in which Cooper's savagery must be normalised, and Aldon's anti-social desires tamed, are offset by Coop's embodiment of both American and Indian within himself, and in the ironic narrative that sees time-stained struggles over land played out in treacherous swamps.",1017705600,11,3136,5.340770791075051
224964,2,6300208192,"DISTANT DRUMS is weak Gary Cooper, indeed. Another example of how Warner Bros. had no idea how to use Cooper during his six picture deal from the late forties to the early fifties.

One  sidebar: This is one of several westerns in the fifties in which Cooper was  a parent.

225047,4,6300208192,"Background: To consider this a great movie, you probably would have had to be watching when it was released to theaters in 1951. ""Distant Drums"" offered color, big screen action, a marquee name in the cast with Gary Cooper. All of which Hollywood's major new challenger television didn't, and that was the one-up idea. In its own time, the film looked impressive. And its box office performance reflected that, becoming one of the top twenty grossing films of the year. Today it may ring some pleasant memory bells for the older set.

Plot: Fifties life was simpler, and so were most of the movie story lines. Here Coop plays an ex-Army officer who together with his small paramilitary band is called to take out a fortress controlled by gun runners supplying arms to hostile Seminole indians in 1840's Florida. The mission goes perfectly, with the fort destroyed, until a much larger Seminole pursuit force diverts the homebound Cooper group from its planned exit route into the treacherous Everglades swamp. The Seminoles of course follow relentlessly, for eighty minutes of screen time.

Assessment: The action and on location photography in the Everglades carry the film. Acting and script are no better than they need to be to support the strengths, although it's a pleasure to see ageless Ray Teal (Bonanza's sherriff Roy Coffee) and folksy Arthur Hunnicutt (Bull from ""El Dorado"") again. All in all, nothing terribly memorable about the finished product, although the two star ratings from VideoHound and Maltin seem a bit harsh. I think the Amazon consensus (3.9 stars out of five as I write) is closer to the mark.",1424908800,,1623,4.963235294117647

...Others have commented on how good this film is.  I thought that I would mention that this film is the third run of a very good plot.  The fact that it filed off the serial numbers and placed it in different dress, time, and locale does not detract in any way. (What is West Side Story but Romeo and Juliet?)
.
...The original was 1940's epic color film (based on historical events in the French and Indian War) ""Northwest Passage"" The second was 1945's war film ""Operation Burma.""  And again, same plot outline in Distant Drums (though it does add a romantic interest and a child...)
.
...Essentially ""Special Ops"" teams make it (with varying degrees of difficulty) to enemy target and accomplish mission.  For whatever reason, getting home proves to be the hellish part... all three films have (for varying reasons) the attack force break into parts... with significant plot impact...
.
...There are of course differences... in locale, time period, various plot details... But the outline of the three stories is the same.  If you are fortunate enough to own all three films you might show them to friends over a weekend (in the order filmed, of course!)

225123,2,6300208192,"Wolf reminds us we cannot go home again.  I am reminded at 70 you can't get the same enjoyment from a movie you saw at 11. Two things stuck in my memory from this movie:
1. I remember Cooper climbing the wall of the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine.  It was a year later I saw the old fort.  Looking at those walls I lost my desire to scale them.  I realized Gary had been paid a lot of money for doing it and the most I could expect is being jailed.
2. The other thing that stuck in my memory, and my flesh for a while, was that Cooper shaved with a hunting knife sans soap.  I lifted my grandfather's pocket knife and tried it as my hero had done.  When there is no beard the knife takes away skin.  The grandfather's displeasure had other lasting effects.
I think I'm generous in giving two stars to this film.  If you are a real Gary Cooper fan you will probably enjoy it some.  It is a far cry from High Noon.  The filmwriters did marvels with Florida geography.  In one days march the the soldiers made it from St. Augustine to the Everglades.  Oh I forgot.  It wasn't St. Augustine where they attacked the fort.  They cleaned the terrain remarkably.  Where were the palmettos?  They would have gotten in the way.
I suppose my wife's displeasure with the film's producers although she worshipped Cooper didn't add to the enjoyment later.  She could not figure out why they would not take a bond haired, blue eyed, truly adorable little girl for a Seminole extra.
I make no claim to being a movie critic.  All I can share with you are my impressions of the show.  If you disagree, I don't blame you.  Just don't wait sixty years between showings.",1229644800,5,1658,4.287096774193548

The technicolor is still very good and the acting is equally good. Coop was at least middle aged in this one but he holds up well, and Arthur Hunnicutt does his normal great job.  I give the movie a full 5-stars as I do not recall any other movie ever dealing with the 1840s and the Seminole War. Leave it to Roaul Walsh to do something such as this.  This is not the typical western, not even set in the west, but in Florida.

If you have never seen this one, might want to watch it.  Gary Cooper was always a fine actor and made any movie better just by being in it. Though the movie is a B-movie from Republic and distributed by Warner Bros. it has a certain ambience after all these years and yet remains quite enjoyable.

225125,4,6300208192,"This is a loose remake of Objective Burma-also directed by Raoul Walsh -with Florida and the Seminole Indians standing in for Burma and the Japanese respectively. Gary Cooper plays Captain Wyatt who at the behest of General Zachary Taylor leads a punitive expedition against the Seminoles .En route they encounter gun runners plying their trade with the Indians and after destroying their fortress liberate their captives,including an attractive young woman played by former ballerina Mari Aldon. They seek to make it back to base under constant attack and ambush from the tribe .
The heart of the movie is its superbly staged action scenes including an underwater knife fight and numerous exchages of rifle fire .The relationship between Cooper and Aldon is sensitively written and played but for the most part action is the thing and it is staged with customary Walsh-ian vigour .Good performances -including a scene stealing cameo from the ever dependable Arthur Hunnicutt-are a plus point as is a rousing Max Steiner score

225129,5,6300208192,"Like many of the other reviewers, I saw this at the theater as a kid...actually a toddler...and it has stuck with me ever since.  Oh, there are some faults with the script, and it isn't HIGH NOON, but then it wasn't meant to be.  Nor was it produced as an historical documentary.  What the movie DID do for me as a kid was spur an interest in reading about the Seminole Indians and Florida history.  It's a good, VERY good action flick.",1163289600,3,436,4.280487804878049
225140,5,6300208192,"Five stars for time travel to childhood! It was as interesting reading the reviews as seeing the movie again. Many reported things I could relate to. The quality of the digital version isn't great, but then again neither was the quality of the projection in the motion picture theatres where many of us saw the original movie as kids. The low quality actually contributed to the memory--somewhat like listening to a Bob Dylan album on a turntable rather than on a CD-- screeches from scratches are as much a part of the 60's era music as the songs themselves. I too related to recalling this as one of my most memorable movies as a kid, because of the action and the terror of trying to escape from a fierce enemy that you did NOT want to be caught by. Seen again as an adult, the effect was different--just an engaging, action-packed cornball Hollywood fantasy typical of the era.

This is fiction. It was a great boys' adventure film in its time. I never even thought of it as factual as a kid, despite being impressionable enough to have nightmares afterwards.

I could not relate to any reviewers who panned this film as an excuse to launch into their ""whites"" versus native American issues. Those folks should read some history in Julius Ceaser's journals and learn what happened to the white forest-dwelling Germanic tribes at the hands of the Romans--it is not so very different from what happened to native American tribes centuries later. Tribes and cultures of humans, in general, have not treated or portrayed others different from themselves at all well or accurately. In this movie, the Seminoles are portrayed with far more substance than other ""Indians"" in films of the 50's era--as competent warriors and formidable enemies with their own code. Other than when the purpose of the producer is a painstakingly accurate portrayal, entertainment is about the best one can expect from Hollywood. No one should expect an accurate rendition of history from 50s ""westerns.""",1154217600,3,1981,4.8579881656804735
225141,3,6300208192,I was very disappointed at the sound quality of this video. The sound goes up and down and buzzes in various places. Have returned for replacement twice and so I have to believe the problem is with the Master Disc.,1141430400,7,214,4.375
225142,3,6300208192,"DD is a corny, old-fashioned movie that wins points for color location photography and a decent amount of action. The portrayal of the Seminole Indians is not particulary offensive, as they are seen as being excellent in battle tactics. The love interest bogs down the story and none of the characters really come to life, but there's a fight in a cool old Spanish fort, a great grassfire scene, and that underwater knife battle with Gary Cooper and the Seminole Chief. So far, nobody has mentioned the rubber alligator. I'm surprised the filmakers couldn't find one shot of an alligator swimming underwater so they pulled a rubber one along with a string. They even show it twice. We all hooted over that. As far as the DVD goes, the sound quality is poor with lots of distortion in the musical score. Most of the print looks good, but there are two times when inferior washed out footage is spliced in for several minutes. Still its a fun movie!",1138320000,5,947,4.642857142857143
225143,1,6300208192,"This 1951 Gary Cooper/Raoul Walsh (director) vehicle is not one of their best.  In fact, the movie is so disappointing in every regard that I am surprised the film was considered for DVD production when so many other excellent 50yr. old movies have yet to see the light of day on DVD.  Still, this selection may be the only film made that addresses the Seminole Indian War of the 1840s (as a point of fact, the Seminoles never did sign a peace treaty with the US, and the war ended quietly). The only two bona fide Hollywood stars are Gary Cooper, of course, and stalwart supporting actor, Arthur Hunnicutt.  Several other actors will be more familiar to moviegoers as TV personalities, like Richard Webb (in the late 1950s program Captain Midnight) and Sheb Wooley, a real-life cowboy/stuntman, who was a regular in Rawhide with Clint Eastwood. I remember first seeing ""Distant Drums"" as a youngster and was hooked on Cooper as an ""Indian Fighter"", the action represented by the ""Whites"" trying to escape the pursuing Indians, and the climactic hand-to-hand, underwater knife fight between Cooper's character and Chief Ocala.  Since then, I and movies have become a wee bit more sophisticated, and ""Distant Drums"" has failed to withstand the test of time.  The color transfer to DVD is sharpe, and the underwater scenes are crisp; however, historical accuracy in the film is non-existant, and the romantic involvement between Cooper and the female lead, Mari Aldon (who is she?), is so contrived that it detracts from the strength of Cooper's character.  What ""deep sixed"" the movie for me were: 1) the 1890s uniforms worn by the c. 1840 US soldiers; 2) the Colt Peacemaker/6 shot revolver used by Cooper (had the film's producer done his homework, he would have known this gun was not in production until the 1870s ... even Gary Cooper should have known this fact!); and 3) the made-up, improvised, gobboli-gook Indian language used by Cooper and other characters.  No, ""Distant Drums"" is not ""High Noon,"" perhaps Cooper's best Western (both films were made the same year).  Sadly, what we are able to recall as exciting or great as children is all too frequently disappointing as adults; ""Distant Drums"" is such an example for me.",1122422400,13,2233,4.904509283819628
225144,4,6300208192,"For Gary Cooper fans, this is an above average flick. It's not in the same class as The Westerner or Sgt York, but it has plenty of suspense and action. It also has one of the hottest leading ladies I've ever seen! Apparently some hotshot must have married her (Mari Aldon) and cut short her career because this seems to be her only lead role. As for Coop, he's in fine shape-ok, a little past his prime, but still handsome and tough. His entrance scene is a great shot showing what a Golden Age movie star ought to look like.
After attacking and destroying the Seminole Indians arms cache (Florida circa 1840) most of the movie concerns the small band of soldiers led by Cooper being chased through the Everglades by some seriously fearsome Seminoles. In a way, it's a chase movie, and the retreating group is in a situation of convincing danger. Therein lies the heroic nature of a Gary Cooper character in his adventure films: he is a formidable opponent, but he can be killed. He is not the superhuman as Clint Eastwood often is, or even John Wayne. You get the feeling that he may not make it to the end of the movie. However, he is the kind of man you would put your faith in and follow just about anywhere. Coop seems to be enjoying himself in the film and looks like he's doing many of his own stunts. The climactic and imaginative underwater knife duel is well done and caps the tension of the story. I have to admit, the movie started a bit slow for me, but I continued watching and was pleasantly rewarded. For a younger Gary Cooper, and more violent film, I would recommend The Real Glory, but this is a harder to find movie than Distant Drum. One bit of criticism is, as usual, with the quality of the print. It's not terrible, but it is faded somewhat. I give it four stars because of the action and suspense, Cooper's lively performance, and Miss Aldon is HOT!",1088208000,38,1875,4.406340057636887
225145,1,6300208192,"This Movie (like all Hollywood Movies involving Native Americans) is a JOKE!  How can one not see the terrible stereotyping of the Native Americans?  Oh yeah I guess stupid and senseless people don't see the racist stereotyping.
As a Seminole/Creek Native American (yes - born and raised on the Seminole Reservation) I can attest that the only thing the film got right was some of the Seminole Regalia (clothing).  And even then it got the feathers, face paint, and weapons wrong.
And there was no such thing as the ""Indian Princess"" in our Tribe much less any other tribe.  The only ""Indian Princesses"" are the ones today that are part of the White Man's Beauty Pagents - which have sadly taken hold in the Native American Culture.
The Seminoles did not ask the White Man to push him into Florida and did not ask the White Man to try and control him either.  And as far as rescuing the Women or even the Slaves - what another joke.  Documented History from so called ""captives"" have proven that Slaves avoided the White Man and any concept of rescue and stayed with the Seminoles and became part of the Tribe.  History also documents that many White so called ""captives"" chose to stay with the Seminoles and refused ""rescue.""  And this is not made up - check the stories of so called ""captives"" themselves as many have been told and even published.
But I did give it one star.  At least it took place in Seminole Country and some of the Clothing for the Seminoles is correct.  Everything else is a joke and bad history.",1085184000,14,1520,4.555147058823529
225146,1,6300208192,"This is maybe the worst film I've ever seen. The indians are evil beasts who,among other horrible things, throw some soldiers into a basin with crocodiles in.
Gary Cooper and his soldiers are innocent people who are just trying to defence themselves: Is that a realistic story?
I was disappointed of Cooper, I'd never thought he would be starring in such a film.
I'd never recommend that picture to anybody",1078704000,7,406,4.814285714285714
225147,5,6300208192,"I first saw this film as a boy in what was probably its second run through the theatres in the mid '50's.  I loved it then; my now 25 year old son loved it in the '80's and I love it today.  It is a '50's era cowboy v. Indian shoot 'em up in an unusual locale, the Florida Everglades.
The plot is very straightforward--Coop is an army officer in pre Civil War Florida who has seen his Indian wife murdered and lives with his son and a loyal detachment of soldiers on his own island.  The bad guys are running guns to the ""hostiles"" from a fort on the other side of Lake Okeechobee.  Coop and his men are sent on a mission to take the fort, destroy it and return home.  They go by boat and take care of the fort but things go awry and they must brave the swamps on foot with a Seminole war party hot on their heels as they try to return home.
The movie basically consists of Coop getting his assignment, taking the fort and then, for the last 75% of the film, trying to get home against great odds.  This one is solid action from virtually start to finish in the '50's good guys v. bad guys style.  It is superbly done.  Accepting it for what it intends to be, I enjoy it just as much at 50+ years of age as I did as an 8 year old.
If you are a baby boomer and loved the action films and TV shows of your youth, you will thoroughly enjoy this one.  Not only does it feature Coop in the lead--his usual quiet but brave and resolute self--but the supporting actors are excellent.  Arthur Hunnicutt as Monk is superb.  Hunnicutt received an academy award nomination for a similar role in ""The Big Sky"" several years later.  He was a Walter Brennan type--just as good but not as well known.  He played Davy Crockett in Republic's ""The Last Command"" and was a superb sidekick to John Wayne and Robert Mitchum in ""El Dorado"" nearly 15 years later.  Hard core baby boomers may remember Robert Webb, whose character is the narrator, as TV's Saturday morning action adventurer ""Captain Midnight.""
This film does an excellent job of creating and maintaining suspense from start to finish.  I can not conceive of anyone who likes '50's action films not thoroughly enjoying it.  Why anyone would see it as ""racist"" is beyond me.  It's just the troopers against the Indians--just like any western of the era, except set in Florida against the Seminoles pre Civil War instead of in the west after.  Coop's character was married to an Indian princess and has a surviving son with her.  This is racist?  Please!
One point of note is that the fort used by the gunrunners and taken by the troopers early in the film is the Castillo de San Marcos--constructed in the 1600's and still standing in St. Augustine, Florida.  You can tour it today.  The famous Seminole chief, Osceolea, was held prisoner there but escaped.
See the film, see the fort.  They are both fun.",1028851200,111,2846,4.358633776091081

7805033,5,6300208192,"This film is one of those rarities of all rarities...a Florida Western. But it was set in the 1840s during the Second Seminole War and Florida at that time was indeed part of the wild frontier. The war was generaled by Zachary Taylor, and he is a minor character in this film; but the main character is Captain Quincy Wyatt, an early settler in Florida. Played by Gary Cooper, he teams up with Navy observer, Lieutenant Tufts (Richard Webb) and leads a small army force to battle the Seminoles and destroy an old Spanish fort used by the Seminoles and gunrunners to store arms. Among the captives freed from the fort is a beautiful blond - Lithuanian actress, Mari Aldon - who (of course) becomes Coop's love interest...even though she is half his age. Also look for Ray Hunnicutt - that wise old Arkansas seer - who plays Monk, an Army scout and Coop's sidekick. They are forced to escape through the Everglades after blowing up the fort, while being pursued by the Seminoles. This is a good ""Western"" directed by icon, Raoul Walsh, like many good and great Westerns made during the 50s. But it only a mere shadow compared to Cooper's ""High Noon"" made one year after this. Coop is Coop and delivers his usual good performance; and the rest of the cast is good too. The plot is interesting, but the Native Americans get the typical Hollywood treatment of the era and that detracts from the quality of the film. Filmed in Technicolor, the original has been lovingly restored by Olive Films...but unfortunately the sound restoration does not measure up and it is not subtitled or close captioned which makes the dialogue difficult to understand. Still highly recommended to Western or Gary Cooper fans!",1501718400,,1700,4.7272727272727275
