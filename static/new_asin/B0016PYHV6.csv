8263942,5,B0016PYHV6,"Pedro Paramo is an excellent film based on the classic Juan Rulfo novel about power and greed in the post-Revolution era in Mexico. It is perhaps John Gavin's best role. The film is filled with well-known Mexican film stars: Pilar Pellicer, Ignacio Lopez Tarzo, etc. The cinematography is excellent as well.",1523923200,,307,5.03921568627451

8263945,5,B0016PYHV6,I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old.  I never forgot it!  It's wonderful to see John Gavin speak in perfect Spanish!  I have always been a fan of his.  The story behind the movie is exceptional!  I would highly recommend it.,1480809600,,241,4.1521739130434785
8263946,5,B0016PYHV6,"Pedro Paramo is among the top 5 books I have read.  I put it alongside The Alchemist, Lost Horizons, The House of the Spirits, and a few others as an all time favorite.  It is one of only two or three books written by the Mexican author Juan Rulfo-a classic book that served as a benchmark for other authors including Gabriela Garcia Marquez who memorized the book in the early stages of his writing career.  Rulfo is credited by many for being the catalyst (Alejo Carpintier also?) for the magical realism style of writing later emulated by Marquez, Isabel Allende and other writers.  I have read this book in both Spanish and English several times, and gain new insight each time I read it.

Pretty successful book for an ex Goodyear Mexico tire salesman don't you think ?",1405814400,,774,4.579710144927536

8263948,4,B0016PYHV6,"Vow...Pedro Paramo gets everything he wants at any cost but the love of his live.  The protagonists although they are dead, communicate and live among us.  Rulfo's masterpiece is portrayed vigor and pasion.",1307836800,5,206,5.212121212121212
