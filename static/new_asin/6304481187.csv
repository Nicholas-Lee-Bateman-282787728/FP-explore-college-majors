7873322,5,6304481187,This is one of the finest documentories out there about the sinking of the titanic The dvd was the best quality for the value,1315094400,,125,4.25
7873323,3,6304481187,"It is imformitive but falls short of being the most comprehensive documentaries on the Titanic .It is only an hour long. But the time it allows it tells of the Titanic and how it came to be . It tells about the basics about the ship , the measurements of the ship , the accomedations , the discovery of the ship, ect. It also has interviews with survivors that include Eva Hart , Ruth Becker and a handful of others. It also has film footage and photographs of the ill-fated ship. It also includes film footage of the wreck. I think it a good dvd for any fan of the Titanic .",1230595200,2,575,4.142857142857143
7873324,2,6304481187,"It is important that persons considering purchasing this DVD read the print carefully.  It is marketed as ""Titanic,"" as in the movie.  When it arrives, it becomes ""The Titanic,"" a decent but hardly  spectacular documentary.  It does not contain anything that is not already  available.  I would not recommend purchase",916272000,8,317,5.24
7873325,3,6304481187,"I was very distressed by some of the intro pieces to this feature, including dolls on board a bad replica of Titanic, as well as a seance (sp?), that was very lame.  I was captured by some later great footage and  documentary facts, as well as some good interviews with actual survivors,  obviously filmed years earlier.  All in all, some good, some very bad.  Worth watching for true buffs who have felt the Titanic's sinking in many  dreams.  RandOpera@aol.com",914630400,4,462,4.772151898734177
