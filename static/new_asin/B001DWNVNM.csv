3541884,4,B001DWNVNM,"""CSNY / D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" documents a politically charged reunion tour of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. While you may not have realized it by listening to classic rock radio, the band always had a political conscience. In particular, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-eacute-j-agrave-Vu/dp/B000002J0L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu</a>"" (1970) featured 'Ohio,' a protest song about the Kent State shootings. Fast forward thirty-five years to the ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" film. The concept of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is used as a poetic device to make a connection between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq. So on one hand, this is a film about a musical tour but it is also a highly critical piece about George W. Bush and his handling of the Iraq War. Exclusively political segments show band members participating in rallies to support the election of anti-war candidates. There are heartfelt profiles of military personnel and their families. At one point Neil Young jams with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Josh-Hisle/dp/B001DX4AZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Josh Hisle</a>, a military veteran turned anti-war rocker. One of the most emotionally charged moments happens when the band is heckled in Atlanta. Scenes from the Colbert Report add humor to an otherwise heavy film. Musically, the 2006 Freedom of Speech tour featured a combination of material off the original ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" album and Neil Young's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-with-War/dp/B000FI9OSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living with War</a>"" (2006). Old favorites like 'For What It's Worth' and 'D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' find new significance along side newer songs like 'Let's Impeach the President' and 'Living with War.' The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B001AW9DKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>&nbsp;is a good accompaniment that features songs played in their entirety. As a musical flick that deals with Iraq, ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" works well along side ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-I-m-Not-Alone/dp/B000G8NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know I'm Not Alone</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavy-Metal-in-Baghdad/dp/B0016PUP0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavy Metal in Baghdad</a>."" Combining great music with leftist politics, ""CSNY / D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"" is an entertaining, thought proving and powerful film.",1222732800,20,2616,7.6655629139072845
3541885,4,B001DWNVNM,"This is a timely rockumentary from Bernard Shakey (Greendale). Bernard who? Okay, you probably know him better as the iconoclastic folk-rock-alt-country-""Godfather of Grunge""-cum-antiwar activist-filmmaker (did I leave anything out?)...Neil Young.

Mixing backstage footage and musical highlights from the 2006 Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Freedom of Speech Tour with vox populi interviews and analysis by ""embedded"" journalist Mike Cerre (a veteran front lines Afghanistan/Iraq war correspondent) the doc plays somewhere between The Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing and Fahrenheit 9-11.

The 2006 reunion of the notoriously mercurial foursome was spearheaded by Young not so much as a nostalgia tour but rather as a musical wake-up call addressing the Bush administration's post 9-11 shenanigans, at home and in Iraq. The tour commenced on the heels of Young's incendiary Living with War album (definitely not on Junior's iPod).

The reaction from audiences (and music critics) was mixed. Young cheekily employs voiceover actors to read excerpts from concert reviews in the local rags, and particularly seems to take perverse delight in highlighting the sneers and snarks (usually involving  ageist references to the band's senior citizen status). I will give him credit for including some (brief) ""warts and all"" excerpts from some early shows in the tour, like one instance where the quartet's rusty pipes are definitely a couple bubbles off plumb. And speaking of falling flat, we also witness a senior moment as a band member takes an onstage tumble.

The most eye-opening moment in the film occurs when the band plays Atlanta, a city usually perceived as a blue oasis in a red state. At first, all appears to be going swimmingly, with the audience happily clapping and singing along with the old ""hits"". But things get interesting as the band launches into some more recent material from Young's aforementioned Living with War album (accompanied by a faux-Karaoke lyric scroll on the huge onstage projection screen, just in case anyone misses the point):

Let's impeach the President for lying
And misleading our country into war
Abusing all the power that we gave him
And shipping all our money out the door

Suddenly, the temperature in the auditorium seems to drop about 50 degrees; catcalls and hisses quickly escalate to boos, bird flipping and near-rioting. Cerre interviews some of the disenchanted as they stalk out; the outrage ranges from bitching about the ticket prices to threatening grievous bodily harm to Neil Young, should they get close enough. Backstage, the band takes the philosophical high road (with age comes wisdom, nu?)

But all cracks about geriatric rockers aside, it becomes apparent that the one thing that remains ageless is the power of the music, and the commitment from the performers. Songs like ""Ohio"", ""Military Madness"", ""For What it's Worth"" and ""Chicago"" prove to have resilience and retain a topical relevance that does not go unnoticed by younger fans. And anyone who doesn't tear up listening to the band deliver the solemnly beautiful harmonies of their elegiac live show closer, ""Find the Cost of Freedom"", while a photo gallery featuring hundreds of smiling young Americans who died in Iraq scrolls on the big screen behind them, can't possibly have anything resembling a soul residing within.",1222732800,3,3343,5.2824858757062145
3541886,5,B001DWNVNM,"This is a documentary film,not a concert or musical. There are parts of songs but no full song is shown apart from the ""Find The Cost of Freedom"" video and the ""Living with War"" videos that are ""extras"".

A powerfull and thought provoking document, this film is set against the Iraq War and shows both sides of the political argument, whilst enforcing the band's belief that the war should end now. Filmed during CSN & Y's ""Freedom of Speech"" tour the film shows reactions from the audience both for and against the band's songs. From veterans themselves and, something I found truly heartrending, from the families of those killed in war. It also shows members of the community, media and politicians campaigning.

The film is an honest account of the tour, even showing a fall by Steve Stills on stage and the rough edges still evident during the early part of the tour. It shows some audience members booing and walking out of concerts. However, one must ask what these people were doing at a CSN&Y concert in the first place given their long history and repetoir of anti war material together with Young's well publicised Living With War album.

There are three moments from the film that are still imbeded in my mind. The first, a veteran who has lost both her legs in battle now fighting in the political arena. The second, a mother who has lost a son in Iraq. Seeing her son's photo with thousands of others, on the screen behind the stage, she reflects that this has been the first time she has seen any public recognition of her sons sacrifice. Finally an audience member advises us that the Government is smarter than us so we should not question it!! Now that is scary.",1222646400,54,1680,4.6120401337792645

Bush administration lead by a merry band of idiots who should have been stopped and tried for their War Crimes and lying to us the American public. Great songs. This shows as Patti Smith sang her song People Have The Power just what we and good friends like Crosby Stills Nash & Young can do to bring about social responsibility and peace to a world that graves it....,1415664000,,575,4.284403669724771

3541894,5,B001DWNVNM,but we saw this documentary on TV over the Memorial Day weekend and I wanted this DVD so we could see the whole thing from beginning to end.  I know some people here were annoyed that there wasn't much concert footage but I don't think it was mean to be. I was quite moved by there mission and the many vets and their families that are hurting and need our support. Good for CSNY for trying to make a difference and for supporting our veterans AND for standing for something! Love it!,1404172800,,484,4.260869565217392

3541901,5,B001DWNVNM,"After watching a taped 2008 interview with Neil Young and Charlie Rose over Memorial Day weekend, I went directly to watch this film. I loved it --- Made me proud to be an American. It reminded me of the sixties and the guts it took for so many to assemble, speak-out and write/sing songs for social change.

I've been listening to Neil Young's Living With War for several years now. However, this film just coalesced the whole thing for me --- motivation behind the music, the Vets and their families...it made me proud to be an American whereby this country has a blessing in freedom of speech --- and a whole host/history of artists who are the epitome of courage when it comes to calling into question the inertia and momentum that tends to mobilize behind a society's propensity for herd instinct.

These guys are heroes in every sense of the word...just listen to the Vets in the film and the family members of the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

My only hope is this film and this album, Living With War, will not be their last. A classic contribution about the soul of America by 4 guys who continue to be examples that COURAGE ROCKS!",1275782400,4,1163,4.5285714285714285
3541902,3,B001DWNVNM,"Before I begin with this, let it be known that I LOVE Neil Young, fully agree with his political message, and am not the least bit annoyed that he chooses to paint his music and live performances with the colors of that message.

That being said, I went to one of these shows and had an absolute ball. There were many things about the concert, including the very loud political message, that were mind-blowing...in the best of ways. But I did not feel that this doc did not do the concerts justice.

First of all - this should not have been marketed as a CSNY doc....b/c as much as the shows themselves were about the whole band (though neil may have gotten a lil extra stage time) the doc is almost all about neil. i realize that the venture was his idea and his passion is what fueled the whole thing...and it was also a tour that coincided with the release of his album....but then why not just call this movie ""neil young is the best ever""? What did it REALLY have to do with CSNY as a whole? I feel like the only moments that the other - equally important, in my opinion - band members got screen time is when they were talking about neil or having a ""senior moment"" (which...to be honest...was depressing, uncomfortable and more or less uncalled for...we know they're getting old...it happens to everyone...do we really need the details?...is it pertinent to the rest of the film in any way? oh yeh...right...it makes neil look cooler...).

I would have liked to see some more concert footage, as they were really good shows. I would have liked to see a movie that acknowledged the political message but also pointed out the incredible amount of fun that these shows were. A lot of people complained that the shows were ""too political"" (which you can see in some of the more gripping scenes in this doc). I disagreed. There were some amazing moments that centered around awareness, activism, protest, mourning our lost soldiers etc... but there was also a great deal of fun and dancing and smiling and laughing. I feel like that aspect of it was not given enough attention.

I would have also liked to see more of the other band members. Especially since, as this is a CSNY-billed film, neil young was kindof scarcely involved with the band. I mean we all know that they were at their best when the 4 of them were together...but lets face it - they hardly ever were! CSN has always been one of the MAJOR protest bands of all time...even without the magnificent neil young. I want to know what david crosby and stephen stills think...we all know what neil thinks. we all know he's a genius. we can shut up about it now. and next time you want to make a movie about the genius of neil young...instead of calling it CSNY...just call it Y.

that being said, if you are a neil young fan...you will definitely enjoy this movie (although i still maintain that it's lacking in actual concert footage). if you are a csny/csn fan....you may enjoy this movie...or you may feel like i do about it: ""meh""",1270080000,9,2997,4.501838235294118
3541903,4,B001DWNVNM,"As the politically-driven QUAGMIRES in Iraq and Afghanistan persist, it is inspiring to know that iconic artists like CSNY are still around, and courageous enough to express our constitutionally-protected rights to free speech, and reminding us all of the real costs of WAR. This production gives voice to the thousands of fallen and permanently scarred soldiers, whom are all too often ignored and/or shunned by the trans-national, corporate military-media industrial complex, yet, whom all too often pay the ultimate price for what they believe in service to our country.

I mean, once you've seen it an get the message, you got it! A concert film would have got the message across just as well. Or even less songs but full versions: cutting away from an excellent song to a tepid interview was annoying even though I love Neil and what he stands for (the individual and his rights).The CD,however, is wonderful and stands up to one listening after another. Except for the poor ravaged voice of Stephen Stills on ""For What it's Worth"". Crosby carries his weight with athority, Stills can hardly move with his obesity. Their harmonies are still flawless, although probably re-recorded.",1264809600,,753,4.669172932330827

What an incredible disappointment to see this DVD. It had little to nothing to do with the CD. It was just a bunch of random takes thrown together, that were trying to relive the anti war scenarios from the past. This was an awful DVD. Boring beyond belief.",1261958400,7,327,4.125
3541906,5,B001DWNVNM,"Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young were the voice of ""My Generation.""  As us 'television children' were fed nightly by Cronkite on the slaughter in Nam, CSNY led us in the protest of this madness.

Sure, at the time, we were young and naive.  Sure we were into drugs,, And sure, the music WE turned on to spoke political and social meanings to us, like it was intended to

Now, we are much older. We are in 'recovery' 12 step programs.  Us old 'anti-Establishment hippies' are now THE establishment.  And, thank God, Crosby, Stills Nash and Young are still at it!  Because, it is Deja Vu all over again!  Who else would have the guts to wake us up to our little forign war adventures these days, just like they did back then when ""Nam"" was festering upon the landscape.

Let us hope that the younger generation takes lessons from us old farts.  War is not the answer. drugs are not the answer. change is the answer. and no one exemplifies that more than David Crosby.  For us older former hippies, get this DVD and re live the cool vibes and licks of our revolutionary band.

This film gives you a feeling that you are along on this tour. Great music of course but along with it comes access to what it would feel like to be a part of the tour. There are revealing insights from Crosby, Stills and Nash about Neil Young and his musical leadership. You also get both sides of how the tour was received by fans at the concerts. Some fans walk out in disgust over the political stance against the war. Most concert fans however are into Neil's stance against the war.

3541909,4,B001DWNVNM,"First, Neil Young's new anti-war songs, for the most part, are godawful, with lyrics as subtle as a sledgehammer and maudlin melodies, at best. Yet, there's something reassuring about these self-styled troubadors, voicing anti-war thoughts for the masses back in '06 on a 'freedom of speech' tour as documented here. Yes, they were better back in the 60s when their songwriting chops were fresher. But give them credit for putting themselves out there with an audience divided by the message. I wondered why some fans sounded put off if they bought tickets. Did they expect just a routine rock concert, and no messages? They couldn't have been real fans, then, since CSN&Y were singing protest songs back in the late 60s and have never stopped.

3541910,1,B001DWNVNM,"Having seen the reunited Crosby,Stills,Nash & Young in concert in 2006, I was anxious to see this DVD, thinking it would be a concert-type of film documenting the tour. Instead, it's 90 minutes or so of Neil Young's personal anti-George Bush agenda. This is a total propaganda film, and I believe the majority of people out there go to a concert to hear the music and not to attend a political rally, which is what most of CSNY's shows from this documentary regressed into. There is no doubt that CSNY is one of the greatest bands ever, fueled and led by the musical genius of Neil Young, but when a Canadian like Neil Young becomes over-obsessed with American politics, it greatly detracts from the music and diminishes the rest of the band as well, who I'm sure were coerced into placating Neil Young by kow-towing to his political ranting in order to secure him for a very lucrative tour.

But CSNY/Deja Vu is a true FILM, a top quality documentary about, not only a concert tour, but about the war that inspired the songs they sing, and the relationship between today's war and the war of 40 years ago that first brought Crosby Stills Nash & Young to international stardom.  In the end, the band plays a leading role, but not a dominant role in the film.  It is more about the several soldiers, former soldiers, soldiers' family members, politicians, and others whose stories are highlighted along the way as the tour winds its way across the country.

Currently, it's available for $9.99, a  relatively reasonable price--not much of a financial loss--for an item that might not have a lasting shelf life in your collection. Video dvds require undivided attention and a considerable block of time, unlike audio media (I've gone through no less than 25 versions of the Deju Vu album and various tapes), where you're able to engage in several activities simultaneously.

""Woodstock"" and ""Gimme Shelter"" are two of the best rock 'n' roll documentaries ever created, but how many times can you watch them and expect the same entertainment value?  This is the problem with the CSNY dvd. Personally, I'd prefer to see a CSNY performance, and I'm hoping Nash continues to oversee their archive projects because he's intent on clearing out the garage,(Neil isn't the only one with a garage) and making the material available to the public.

Although CSNY, apparently, weren't too enthused about their 1974 tour performances, I hope they remember that 60,000 people packed those arenas and  stadiums on a nightly basis, enjoying those 3-hour performances, mistakes and all. By anybody's account, that is a significant number of people, worth exploiting in terms of marketing potential. It's a win/win situation, a marketing maverick's dream.

For the sake of CSNY fans everywhere, including me, I sincerely hope Obama's presidency is successful.  I cringe at the thought of another DVD from CSNY (Deja Vu Two: The No Hope Tour) in protest of the next administration, but, maybe then, and only then, they'll return to making music! Father time permitting.

3541921,4,B001DWNVNM,"My son Joshua was a senior in high school on that fateful morning of
September 11th,2001. The next day he and his best friend went
to the local Army recruiter and enlisted. Like all Americans,he felt helpless in this terror-filled new universe we all woke up to
on the morning after. Nothing would ever be the same. Americans were
facing a ""faceless"" enemy;my son and thousands of young Americans like him,felt they had to ""do something"". In the spring of 2003,Josh
entered Iraq and would not come home until January 2004. America had finally put a face to our enemy;Saddam Hussein had to be taken down.
Mission accomplished...but was it the right mission?
CSNY/DEJA VU chronicles the aftermath of Bush's decision to topple Saddam.
The ""liberators"" suddenly became ""occupiers"" and our brave young men and women were no longer soldiers but were thrust into becoming policemen.
It is this new role of the American soldier that is the underlying basis for this Bernard Shakey film and THIS is a Bernard Shakey film like no other. There are intercuts of folks that do not share CSNY's  view
of Dubya's policies and those folks do not mince words. Everyone has heard
what happened at the Atlanta concert and it's hard to watch. There's an
interview with some cat who walked out and he makes the comment that the
people in  Bush's government are smarter than CSNY.I bet he wishes he could take that comment back now!!!This is NOT a performance film;it is a
documentary of four aging icons who could no longer stand on the sidelines and let the game go on without any regard to the rules. Crosby has stated on numerous occasions that Bush and Co highjacked America's
principles and turned them into policies. It is these policies
that have killed thousands of our soldiers and tens (if not hundreds) of
thousands of Iraqi civilians. Maybe CSNY made money off this tour...I've
read some criticism of that. Who cares? They did put their music where their mouth was and I thank them for it. My son Josh went back to Iraq again in the spring of 2005. I had to live with war all over again. He came back
in early 2006 but he was a changed young man. At 21, my son had seen things
most male baby boomers will never have to experience. Seeing CSNY
sing ""Find The Cost Of Freedom "", beneath the backdrop of thousands
of photos of young soldiers killed in action,is chilling. I know we were blessed that Josh came home safely after two tours.
This film was made over two years ago...OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS ARE STILL DYING today in a country that will not pay their share for their cost of freedom. CSNY still preach that love is better than hate,understanding is better than confusion and peace is still better than war. Carry on!!!!",1223683200,30,2717,4.634854771784233
3541922,5,B001DWNVNM,"No, this is not a concert DVD.  Yes, this is a protest DVD.  Any questions?  And it is not totally true to say this does not have them performing.  It does, you just don't get to see and hear the entire song, with the exception of maybe one that drew the ire of some Atlantans who *apparently* thought CSN&Y and their ""Freedom of Speech"" tour was going to be Skynyrd's Greatest Hits, or maybe REM performing.  For Jiminy Cricket's sake, it's Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.  Get the fingers and toes out and start counting the protest songs they did as a group and with their other groups.  It seems many people didn't bother to realize this was the companion tour to Neil Young's ""Living with War"" album.
Any rate, Neil plays both sides of the coin very well on this.  He gives the pro-wars as much time as the anti-wars while maintaining an anti-war stance.  Mainly though, this is about the troops, dead and alive.  The Vets dealing with what they experienced over there (meaning, in this case, both Vietnam and Iraq) as well as the parents who are suffering with the loss of their children or the uncertainty of their return.  At the end, 'Find the Cost of Freedom'....oh my god.  You cannot help but cry.  The last hour or so of this is just intense.  The first half-hour or so is about them getting together to do the tour and the making of the record and rehearsals and stuff.  Then, the story begins.  This is not CNN.  This is not FOX News.  This is not your local nightly broadcast.  This is reality...at least filtered through the (at least somewhat) biased eyes of Neil Young.  Some was done for shock value, I am sure, but to also show, ""this is what our kids are going through"".  You must see this movie.  If nothing else, rent it before you buy it.
But, it is Deja Vu, and that is something Neil does a good job of showing.  We were going through a lot of the same political problems 40 years ago.  The names were a little different (Viet Nam/Richard Nixon), but the dissention among the populace is as obvious now as it was then.",1223510400,5,2043,4.386666666666667
3541923,1,B001DWNVNM,"First let me say that I've always been a fan. Love their music and own most of their DVDs.

If you want to watch Iraq war protest this is for you. If you're expecting to watch Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young perform live music Do NOT buy this!

I have no problem with them protesting the Iraq war. I just didn't want to waste my time and money watching them protest. They can do that for free. Heck, they are all millionaires.

I'm not. I spent my money to watch them perform their music. My mistake...

I almost forgot to mention that it appears that the DVD I received has the something off center as no matter what DVD player I put it in it makes a loud rattling sound.

I think Amazon has made a mistake listing this as a music DVD as there is mostly talking on this.

Bottom line, if your considering buying this because you like their music and harmonies don't buy it, you will be disappointed.",1223510400,6,899,4.228070175438597
3541924,3,B001DWNVNM,"interesting documentary, but would have liked more music.  neil should have released this as a 2 dvd set, one disc with the documentary and the other disc, the full concert.",1223424000,5,173,4.766666666666667
3541925,3,B001DWNVNM,"Neil Young has made a career of giving us what he thinks we should have rather than what we want. He often makes brilliant choices, and his misfires don't hurt anyone. Except here. CSNY has taped their last three extraordinary tours, enough and more to create a live DVD. Why this has never happened is a travesty. OK, a tragedy. A bummer? These guys catch fire onstage, and it is more than political. I was hoping there would be a version with the full concert included, like the Tom Petty disc,  but it didn't happen. We get something that is interesting, that really isn't worth seeing more than once. Neil knows best, I guess. Trouble is, the stuff will probably come out after most of the people who care about it are dead.",1223337600,5,728,4.473684210526316
3541926,5,B001DWNVNM,"Like another reviewer has already asked, why were the Atlantans so upset and surprised  when they heard  the lyrics to ""Let's Impeach the President?""  Was this particular evening the first time that these concert-goers had ever bothered to listen to the lyrics of this band's songs?

I've been a fan of this band from their beginning and I don't recall many albums released by the band  or the individual members that did not contain left-leaning politically-tinged material so why the shock from the folks at this particular concert?  Do the radio stations in Atlanta only play ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Southern Cross"" but not ""For What Its Worth"" or ""Military Madness?""

Even Lynyrd Skynyrd knew where Neil  Young was coming from when he sang songs like  ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"" and he wasn't being complimentary.  These people would probably consider ""Ohio"" as an appropriate jingle for a ""Come Visit Ohio"" infomercial and not even blink if ""Long Time Coming"" were used in a commercial for a laxative.

If so many of them hadn't complained in the film about how much money they had paid for their tickets you might think that they had simply shown up to a concert by an unknown band after having won free tickets.  I dare anyone to watch the behavior and comments of these supposed ""fans"" in this film and not cringe with embarrassment.  These people would probably go to a Bob Dylan concert and want their money back if they heard a song like ""Blowin' in the Wind.""",1222992000,11,1470,4.74015748031496

8295276,5,B001DWNVNM,"The movie wasn't at all what I expected, I.e., a simple documentary of the band's 2006 tour. Instead the movie hung its theme on the band's political stance - and how that resonated (or not) with their musical fans.
One poignant scene depicted their fans' displeasure over a song asking that George W. Bush be impeached.
This is cinema verite at its best, and while it became cringeworthy at times, it was an excellent example of the nexus of music and politics.
