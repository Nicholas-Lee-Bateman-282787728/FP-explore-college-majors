8623150,5,B00GHH9IFS,"I really enjoyed this film, it reminded me a lot of the Hangover with a handful of pop-culture parodies (To Catch a Predator, Cheaters, Dos Equis Commercial, etc.) which were all pretty funny.  I really enjoyed the music for the film too and thought the composer did a nice job of enhancing the various parodies.  At times the plot moves a little slow and the humor was definitely on the crude side but if you're looking for a few good laughs and a film you don't have to think too hard about, this is a great pick for you.",1404086400,,523,4.2727272727272725
8623151,3,B00GHH9IFS,"Brian Hooks is in Vegas and is being shook down for money. He tells a story as flashbacks about himself attempting to pitch and fund a sketch/parody comedy show. The sketches are not connected. As to being funny, they are hit and miss. I liked the ""To Catch a Fatofile"" sketch which parodies Chris Hansen's reporting. I shamefully liked the beer commercial parody. The other stuff was far too lowbrow and unfunny to laugh at, such as ""The Tooter"" about a king with gas problems, or the sketch about a cheating girlfriend.

Too much of the film is poorly written. The stuttering waitress didn't make it. The Fat Betty joke was a yawn. Somehow they managed to make midgets unfunny.

2 1/2 stars
