8066505,2,B0009U5CS6,"Was disappointed to find the songs used throughout the documentary were not done in 'concert' form.  Disappointing to only be able to listen/watch half of favourite tracks.  The documentary itself was amazing and it was wonderful to see how far this band has come. The 'concert' play list was from a 1990 concert that I already have, although I have to admit the sound quality was a lot better on this one.",1406332800,,406,4.625
8066506,2,B0009U5CS6,I bought this because it says it is concert footage...there is very little concert shown and what there is are just snippits. It is a wonderful documentary...but that's what is should say it is.,1397692800,,194,4.735294117647059
