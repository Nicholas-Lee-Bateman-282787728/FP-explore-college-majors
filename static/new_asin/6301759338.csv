The costumes look pretty good, although I suspect the movie as a whole suffered from a low special effects budget.  The story isn't half bad even though the pacing of the movie is pretty much off kilter or non existant.  The other weakness of this film is the fighting sequences - there is no blood anywhere - not even on the sword.  And people go down in only 1 or 2 hits making for a less than satisfying viewing of an action film (I guess this makes sense from a safety point of view - I can here someone saying ""OK, make sure nobody's eyes get poked out - so everybody do the action sequences carefully and slowly"").
And no, there is no nudity in here just in case you wanted to know that.
I actually liked the movie as a whole - but it isn't a keeper imo.  Some of the story was a little hard to follow and I suspect that the movie assumed that you had watched the previous ator movies.",1200700800,2,1007,4.112244897959184
7815196,5,6301759338,"Quest for the Mighty Sword aka Ator 3 was directed by the ""King of Sex and Horror"" Joe D'Amato aka Aristide Massaccesi. Quest for the Mighty Sword is about a god who gave a mighty sword to the king of Aquiles to bring justice to his people and now he wants it back, but the king rather gives his life than the sword. Goddess Dehamira, who spoke for him, is being taken all her privileges and banned in a circle of fire, until a human arrives who's strong enough to free her. When prince Ator becomes 18, he gets the sword from the mean sorcerer gnome Grindl (who is a troll), to free Dehamira and his people. On his journey Ator has to fight against dragons, robots and other fantastic creatures.

This is a great movie. The budget was I believe only 3,500 dollars and when you watch the film you will see. In my this is the weirdest one in the series but it isn't as bad as Ator 4: The Iron Warrior, I couldn't even watch that just clipping through it!!

Check the other Ator movies is you can, Just beware that if you buy Ator - The Fighting Eagle released by Legacy Entertainment it is cut! For some reason they decided to cut out all the blood, a decapitation scene and the little to no gore that it had. Also look out for in my mind the best movie in the Ator series The Blade Master. See Ator fight a huge Python, Clyde on a air Clyder and many other things!",1187481600,3,1364,4.162878787878788
7815197,5,6301759338,"I never thought I'd see *this* video for sale. First off, an explanation about the five star rating. You see, there are some cineastes such as myself who scour the bargain video racks for the most bizarre, mind blowingly bad, or unintentionally funny films ever made. I consider such films ""anti-art,"" a statement in and of itself against our hyper-consumerist culture. Most people, however, just call it ""crap."" Either way, Quest for the Mighty Sword is a craptacle of craptacular proportions. It's got stock footage, flubbed lines, terrible monster costumes and I nicknamed the hero's buddy ""Abdul the Elizabethan-Arabic Australian"" (I was drunk when I first saw it). If you thought Battlefield Earth was the funniest comedy of the year, check this out.",1115942400,8,755,5.146341463414634
