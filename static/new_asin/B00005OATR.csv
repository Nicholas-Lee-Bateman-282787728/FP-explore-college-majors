1640701,4,B00005OATR,"Although the English subtitles may be somewhat obtrusive, I found it easy to become consumed by the performance so as not to notice. Hagley is an adequate Susanna and though she may not carry the role as well as Bartoli,  she was pleasing to watch.  Count Almavina and Don Bartolo were well cast  and Terfel is the quintessential Figaro.",943488000,7,337,4.677966101694915

1640703,5,B00005OATR,"Ok, i have seen many versions of Nozze di figaro on dvd, and let me tell ya, this is by far the best!!, brynn terfel is woderful!!, alison hagley is  incredibally beautiful and makes susanna more likable and charming.
 Cherubino's arias are priceless.... Pamele helen stephen does a wonderful job, there is more emotion and character in her then any one since  Von Stade !!!
I am a big fan of  the widescreen format, this  being filmed in that aspect...makes me love it even more.",1261526400,,480,4.6
1640704,5,B00005OATR,"I started with the Salburz M22 'Figaro' with Netrebko as Susanna. It was excellent but I think I would have preferred to see this one first.

I am not a musicologist by any means but I am passionate about music. I can appreciate beautiful music and whether the sound quality is not up to par (as some other reviewers have noted), I find just the staging and the joy of this production make it a worthwhile purchase. I was thrilled with the settings. They are simple, but the imagination fills them in. The entire production was lively and the energy radiates from the characters. This is the kind of interpretation that will lead you into further personal discoveries of Mozart. His music is beautiful, uplifting and thrilling with so many nuances, so much subtlety, one is still left at the end dying for more. Like a good wine, you are both intoxicated and thrilled.

There is humor here, pathos, elements of joy and moments of sorrow. Life is a transient festival and the music and the singing reflects the changing vicissitudes of the human heart. Forgiveness is the order of the day and the count is ultimately the one in need of learning love and compassion.

Buy this DVD, order a pizza the day it arrives, open a bottle of wine and fall in love.",1236816000,4,1253,4.56
1640705,3,B00005OATR,"I couldn't help comparing this recording (performed at the Theatre du Chalet, Paris) with Gardiner's English performance made the same year.  Same cast, same orchestra, but this is the better of the two performances.  The singing is surely more vibrant (even if you could find better on some other recordings).
Whether they were included in the actual performance or not, two arias from the fourth act have been cut (Basilio's and Marcellina's) and the remaining ones have been rearranged.
The real reason to buy this recording is without doubt Bryn Terfel.  You will not find a finer Figaro, and that alone is worth the purchase price.  Alison Hagely is also a fine Susanna, and all in all the rest of the cast give very good performances.
I do have misgivings about Sir Gardiner's interpretation: as is generally the rule with English conductors, his basic Mozart philosophy is to play it quick and light.  Certainly Figaro is not so dark as Giovanni, nor as poignant as Cosi, but the present recording is lacking in weight.  His approach to the appogiaturas becomes very tiring by the end; whatever your opinion of how they should be sung, the fact is Mozart didn't write it the way that they chose to sing it.
This isn't my favourite Figaro, but it isn't a bad choice either.  You'd save yourself a fair amount of money by picking up the DVD instead of the CD recording, but you might do better still to look for a Figaro with a German conductor (Karajan, Bohm, Furtwangler, etc.).  My favourite though is Abbado's recording with Lucio Gallo and Cecilia Bartoli",1232755200,3,1565,4.770370370370371
1640706,5,B00005OATR,"This performance sparkles. Musically, it is fabulous--I have the CD version as well and this is what prompted me to get the DVD. None of Mozart's poignancy and empathy is lost, and all of his vivacity is brought out. Others have emphasized the fun as in `funny' or `comedic', and it is certainly there. I add that there is also a great deal of fun as in `pleasurable'. There is a flirtatious zing to the whole performance, perhaps more so than to many other Figaros.

The staging is all fine and good until Act III, when it becomes nothing less than stunning. That Act alone makes the DVD well worth getting! It accentuates the subversive bite of the opera brilliantly. Figaro is a piece of social satire, every bit as relevant today as it was over two hundred years ago. It is among other things a story of love and sensuality set against ossified social structures. When the stage changes before the Count's big aria(`Vedro mentr'io sospiro') and the magnificent buffoon--all decked out in the regalia of power--rages in his gilded cage, it is truly jaw-dropping. The contrast is made all the more delicious by having an actor as magnificent-looking as Gilfry play the Count! The various subversive jibes at the Count are delivered with obvious glee and the commonfolk keep grinning throughout the action. I too found myself giddy with delight watching the Count fold under the collective pressure of his servants. The dominant classes of the 18th century must have been dumbfounded, sensing the loss of their authority and not comprehending how it happens; having to furthermore sit there in total rapture and feel the rug being gently pulled out from underneath them. Doing justice to Mozart's satirical subtext never ever overshadows the warmth and beauty of the music. In `Dove Sono', the Countess' glittering costume, impeccable wig, and doll-like make-up bring out her desolation and vulnerability even more. It is a deeply moving sight.

To those who want to see a gorgeously staged and performed Figaro, this DVD offers plenty. And then some. I did not find the sets minimalist; I found them just right, neither stuffily traditional nor wackily modernist.

And now, where is the Zrich/Harnoncourt production from 1996 in region-free format? What ad-wizard came up with the silly idea of limiting that one to the European market?",1197936000,10,2338,4.959183673469388
1640707,5,B00005OATR,"The cast here in this first rate production all seem to be fully commited to the tale itself staying very naturally in character throughout. The camera work is particularily astute always following through to the most fulfilling perspective of this charming consistently dynamic hearfelt performance. If this is to be one's first experience with the art form you're getting the right idea. Now imagine if we could all communicate that way,hmm...",1171238400,,445,5.28169014084507
1640708,3,B00005OATR,"The stars are given mainly for Bryn's singing. I fully understand the clamour on Bryn Terfel. His vocal abilities are never doubted. His acting ability is also solid.

HOWEVER, he is not a convincing Figaro.

Bryn is primarily hampered by his stage presence - not lack of it, but perhaps too much of it. Figaro in Le Nozze is not a towering figure, but a self-willed, witty, shifty and worldly-wise enough lover of Susanna. Hermann Prey, if ever, portrayed a near-perfect Figaro with his good looks and witty charm. Terfel may make a tremendous Wotan or Dutchman, but not Don Giovannis or Figaros.

Sorry to say this, since am I fan of Terfel, but that's the reality.

Alison Hagley's Susanna falls in the same plight iwth regard to looks, though vocally she is even less convincing than Terfel: her middle and lower registers simply disappeared in this performance.

Martinpelto is average but secure. Gilfry is not at his best. The Cherubino is disastrous in looks, let alone vocally. Hard to imagine Figaro would sing a 'Non piu andrai' to such a character as portrayed in this production.

Yes, there are quite a good number of better 'Le Nozzes' available out there.",1170115200,,1171,4.800995024875622
1640709,5,B00005OATR,I would give this DVD 9 stars if I could.,1168300800,3,41,3.2
1640710,3,B00005OATR,"I bought this DVD mainly for Gilfry. I have him on DVD in a few other operas, including Le Nozze di Figaro from the Zurich opera with him playing the count, which is my favorite ""Figaro."" But it is only available on region 2 DVD for some reason, so I started looking for another great ""Figaro"" on Region 1. I'll have to admit that this production from the Thearre du Chatelet isn't it. I was actually very disappointed. The singing is very good, though I think Gilfry did an even better job on the Zurich one. Hagley plays a most wonderful Susanna, and Terfel is by far the BEST figaro I have ever seen.

The thing that really turned me off about this production is the staging and costuming. I know the Zurich opera can be somewhat strange with their staging, but this production of ""Figaro"" was a little scary. The staging was VERY odd to me, and the makeup waaayyy overdone. I had a hard time getting into it because of this.

Another gripe, though a small one, was some of the songs that were deleted from the opera altogether, like Basilio's aria ""In quegli anni"" and Marcellina's aria ""Il capro e la capretta."" I was disappointed about that, especially because I think Marcellina's aria is a wonderful one. This is not the first time I have seen these two songs deleted from the opera though.

So I give this 3 stars because the singing was great, everything else about it wasn't.",1151625600,9,1386,4.470355731225297
1640711,5,B00005OATR,"I've been a lover of this opera ever since I heard it for the first time about 15 years ago. I bought a CD version, made cassette tapes for my car and must have listened to it at least 40 or 50 times before the tape broke. I've never seen a staged version of it and this is my first purchase of any opera on DVD. I was very pleased in spite of some of the adverse reviews about this version available on Amazon.

The staging is sparse but does not detract from the overall dramatic effect. The singing is luscious and the acting is absolutely sensual. I was in tears with delight and passion at many points and will watch it for many years to come.

Thank you Mozart.",1151280000,4,667,4.123076923076923
1640712,5,B00005OATR,"This is by far the best ""Marriage of Figaro"" available on DVD.  Gardiner conducts an orchestra of period instruments (that you actually get to see in during the overture).  The acting and staging is fine;  Alison Hagley is especially adorable and touching as Susanna.",1141776000,3,267,5.0227272727272725
1640713,5,B00005OATR,"This is my favorite Opera DVD, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Opera and wondering where to start.  It's a classical piece classically performed, but with vibrant young cast.  The interpretation is fresh and interesting but doesn't rely on anachronisms.  The stage is spare, and the video quality is sub par, but the music, acting, direction, and editing are top notch.

The show is full of situational comedy, which is performed with taste, enthusiasm, and exquisite attention to detail.  Figaro has many the same sorts of themes and scenes that populate trite movies and TV shows:  Fighting over women, getting caught in the middle of an embarrassing misunderstanding, hiding in the closet, getting out of a lie by lying more, seeming arbitrary plot twists, and of course a horny teenager.  There's even some Law and Order in there.  But accusing Le Nozze di Figaro of being trite is like accusing Mozart of using authentic cadences.  It becomes quickly apparent as you see the DVD that those comic absurdities I mentioned are the whole point.  Mozart was great at drawing you into a piece with a simple, catchy tune and then taking you on a fantastic musical journey.  It's the same with the situational comedy.  It keeps getting more and more twisted and tangled, and by the end it's a mess of Shakespearian mistaken identities, that nevertheless arrives naturally at a believable, satisfying resolution.

But it's not just a comedy; the Count is a great character.  He's generally a good man, but is blinded by lust and jealousy and prone to losing his temper.  He's sympathetic, but we also see how his selfish actions hurt Rosina, Figaro, and Susanna.  Rosina is perhaps the most admirable character of all, her final song of forgiveness ""droppeth as a gentle rain from heaven.""

The directors, cinematographers, editors clearly love the music as well as the actors.  Scenes are cut to highlight Mozart's musical nuances as well as the stage action.  If Susanna is ascending a scale and about to hit the tonic exclamation point of the phrase, you'll get a good shot of Hagley at just the right moment.  The camerawork and editing keeps you right in the action and almost never feels forced.  This is the best I've seen of a live recording.  Only full movie adaptations, such as Franco Zeffirelli's ""La Traviata,"" surpass this level of intimacy.

There are some minor issues-the picture quality is mediocre, (though the entire show fits on a single DVD, which is convenient).  The quality of singing is excellent, even amazing from a dramatic interpretation, but occasionally there seem to be some minor technical sacrifices.  At no point was I overwhelmed by the virtuosity of the singers, but due to the importance of the ensemble in this Opera that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I also think Carlos Feller's voice as Bartolo is unpleasant, though that is probably intentional as well.

None of these things really detract from the overall experience, and I recommend this DVD to anyone curious about Mozart Opera.",1116115200,19,3042,4.937007874015748
1640714,4,B00005OATR,"I am a great fan of the 1973 Glyndebourne DVD of this opera starring Kiri Te Kanawa and Ileana Cotrubas, and thought that I would never find another video version of ""Figaro"" that might rival it.  But here is a more recent performance that is in many, many ways just as good.  First of all, there simply cannot be a better Figaro than Bryn Terfel.  The voice is magnificent, which goes without saying, but his acting is absolutely superb.  Equally excellent is Alison Hagley's Susanna, sadder and wiser than Cotrubas, but delightful in every way.  Rodney Gilfry and Hillevi Martinpelto make a fine, young Count and Countess (you can really imagine them as the Almaviva and Rosina of Rossini's ""Barber""), although Martinpelto doesn't quite have the stamina to sustain her set pieces.  In spite of a truly bizarre first few minutes and an Act IV set that doesn't quite work (or make much sense), this is a clever, minimalist production for which the director and John Eliot Gardiner have worked most successfully with the singers to create indelible, three-dimensional characters and performances.  All in all, this is a significant ""Figaro,"" one that you will find yourself watching over and over.",1106870400,8,1196,4.95
1640715,5,B00005OATR,"This is the best performance of Le Nozze di Figaro I have seen and ranks as one of my favorite opera dvds. The sound quality is fantastic (superb balance between voice/orchestra). Too often, great performances of opera are marred on dvd by poor sound and visual quality. Luckily, the engineers at Archiv/Univeral have outdone themselves with this fantastic disc. Highly recommended!",1088467200,12,382,5.278688524590164
1640716,5,B00005OATR,"Bryn Terfel, of course, as Figaro and Alison Hagley as Susanna  shine in this production of Le Nozze di Figaro. (I don't pretend to be objective about Alison Hagley but the role of Susanna was tailor-made for her.) The staging is quite sparse but the singing is strong across the board, although I also disagree with the beginning of ""Voi che sapete..."".  Countess Rosina Almaviva, as played by Hillevi Martinpelto, seems to be having too much fun with the intrigue which makes it less than convincing when she launches into ""Dove sono i bei momenti...""
By the way, catch the unintentional plucking on the guitar by Hagley at the beginning of ""Voi che sapete...""  when Susanna is supposedly accompanying Cherubino as he sings to Rosina.
Rodney Gilfry almost manages to steal the show with his simpering Count Almaviva.  (A good comparison is the Glyndebourne Fest. Opera dvd of Figaro with Gerald Finley our protagonist  and...Alison Hagley as Susanna. Andreas Schmidt casts a darker shadow as the Count. Both DVDs are worth the $$ to have in your collection.)
One little beef about both DVDs and opera dvds in general. The capability of the dvd technology is being wasted when Extra features are not included. How many times have you watched a production on dvd and wished you could see footage from a rehearsal or even a snippet on how certain stage or music direction decision was made? If there is someone from DG reading this, I implore you to give it some thought. Interviews with the principals about how they approached their roles and their thoughts on the production is the type of information that should be on the dvd. (Kudos for having the Italian libretto on this dvd.)
How much easier would it be to attract the younger generation if they can be made to understand the opera through comments made by people they see on the screen.
My ten year old daughter enjoys watching the Glyndebourne dvd (principally because Finley is ""good looking"") but she has questions about the production that I can't answer.  I, for one, would gladly pay more for the extra features if thats what it takes.",1075075200,28,2100,4.787292817679558
1640717,2,B00005OATR,"Singing is good but the picture ( settings rather empty and over-simplified ) is not as good and the orchestra is not so good. The tempo as a whole is fast, particularly the overture. Yes, the audience then preferred a faster pace, but certainly not rushing.

The orchestra was not supportting the singer(s): outpacing or else eclipsing the singers here and there--few conductors except Toscanini would perfer such a tempo. The odd accentuations added by the conductor totally failed to dramatize but were quite enough to scare the comfort and peace of the audience off.  There is little drama, nor poetry, nor lyricism. The whole opera is chopped up into pieces. One gets the feeling that this is just a rehearsal instead of any serious performance save and except some great individual singings. The result: it sounds a mixture of Mozart's metal-scraping giggling and the noble music he promised us!",1059350400,6,901,5.0
1640718,4,B00005OATR,"I really belive in the title of my review.  Musically the performance of the orchestra and the singers is first-rate; technically sound and in the spririt of Mozart and the play. Theatrically the production of the opera is also excellent: The minimalistic staging is imaginative and well suited to the comic plot and all the soloists are acting very good.
Technically the production of the DVD doesn't match the production of the opera but its not that bad; the sound is great (I prefer LPCM since my stereo equipment are far better than those of the home theater)with good stereo image and dynamics and the picture is at good VHS level (soft with some ""artificial"" colour feel).
Generally I think it is a very enjoyable disc and a must have for any opera lover.",1041120000,9,762,4.686567164179104
1640719,4,B00005OATR,"I bought this opera because it has Italian subtitles, 10 points here. Its great to be able to follow the singing. I thought the singing was really good, clear, and there were nuances that I hadn't heard before. I've seen and heard Figaro many times so this was good. Orchestra is great too. The big problem with this one was the visuals. They are pretty poor. The film quality is poor, and the stage minimalist. Unfortunately Brian Terfel as Figaro ends up looking like a smurf in a nappy, with a strangely contorted face. The whole set along with the cast looks like a cheap cartoon. I'll have to watch it more to to hope it grows on me. This is a pity because there is alot of emotional content to Figaro and the ludicrous set/makeup/costumes means this production loses the emotive force that in other Figaro's have brought me to tears.",1035417600,20,839,4.526315789473684

1640722,4,B00005OATR,"VIDEO & AUDIO:
The video quality is flat out terrible. It is in widescreen, 1.78:1, but is non-anamorphic. The colors are faded and washed out and the picture overall is soft, lacking detail. The audio is slightly better then the CD version, more stereophonic and fuller. Overall, quite good. However, the recording could have been even better had it been remixed in Dolby 5.1. There are times in the recording where the orchestra over takes the singers and vice-versa. This problem could have been fixed with Dolby 5.1 by mixing the track so that the orchestra predominately comes out of the left and right speakers and by having the singing dominate the center speaker, thus creating a much more transparent sound.
The subtitles are a good size. Easy to read while never obscuring anything.
Like the CD, chapters are well placed, 63 in total. The booklet that comes with the DVD contains brief descriptions of what happens in each chapter.
THE RECORDING
While this is labeled as a semi-staged performance, calling it a minimalist production would be more appropriate. Sets normally consists of one dimensional backdrops. The lighting design is equally as straight forward and simple. Personally, I like this approach a lot. Because the opera is so character driven, it can be performed without Ring Cycle-esque sets. Since the camera only has the actors to focus on, the video recording comes off being much more intimate then one filled with lots of wide shots to show off the set designer's handy work.
Terfel's Figaro is excellent, probably the best in any modern recording. Hagley's Susanna is equally as good. The production also benefits from the young cast. Because no one is too old for their part, the sexual tension between the characters comes out well. The acting and singing overall is good, with the actors stressing the comic half of the opera quite a bit, but never over the top. As normal, Gardiner's English Baroque Soloist are technically brilliant.
FINAL THOUGHTS
If you enjoyed past incarnations of Gardiner's Figaro, you're going to like the DVD. If you're looking for a DVD version of the opera which takes full advantage of the format, move along.
At the same time, you do get your money's worth. For the most part the audio is excellent, singing and playing are great, the whole opera is on one disc, you can see the action and there are subtitles.

7948502,4,B00005OATR,"This recording is now of such an age, dating from as long ago as 1992 that the technical side of the production clearly lags behind the modern recording techniques available today. The screen format is 4:3 and the sound is in simple stereo. The videography is not high definition.

However not every issue should be judged by these criteria alone. There are also musical considerations that may be of such value that they overcome all such obstacles. I believe that this recording is possessed of such considerations.

The whole production, under the experienced and highly expert guidance of the conductor and director Oliver Mille, achieves tremendous and consistent conviction that is absolutely right for the music and its period. Every tempo and every phrase is musically judged to perfection. The sound balance on original types of instruments achieves both cutting edge precision of tremendous verve as well as considerable sensitivity and pathos as required.

The stage setting is minimalist but completely effective allowing for characters to appear, disappear and inter-react with convincing ease. The costuming seems entirely appropriate to the historical period of the opera.

All of this would be as naught of course if the singing and acting of the whole cast fell below the highest standards. This they do not do but conversely the whole production is crowned by superlative singing and acting throughout. Alison Hagley is a Susanna to die for - attractive, the right age, lots of energy and humour, the perfect voice and a natural actress. Terfel is ideally matched to her stage personality as shown here and between them there is truly vibrant communication. Like Terfel, Gilfry has a strong stage presence and his acting ability is matched by equally excellent singing. In this he is well partnered by Hillevi Martinpelto as the wronged countess. She has a lovely voice and her key aria is sung most affectingly. Gilfry is able to achieve a true sense of genuine contrition at the end which enables the final bars to sweep to a properly joyful conclusion.

All the supporting roles are equally carried off - not a weak moment anywhere.

This is not the only recording of this opera that I own. It is now the oldest and on more than one occasion I have considered whether the time has come for us to part. But within moments of its commencement I am completely captivated and cannot conceive of depriving myself of its countless joys.
This comes highly recommended for all the above reasons therefore.

For myself I would give it the full 5 stars but out of consideration for those who may be more concerned with recording dates I would compromise and finally award an overall 4 stars. This seems a fair solution in my opinion and reflects the extraordinary musical standards now somewhat out of step with advances in recording techniques made since 1992.",1342051200,4,2872,4.970833333333333
