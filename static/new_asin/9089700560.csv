7901278,5,9089700560,"This is the most gorgeous coral DVD Ive seen so far. My favorite part is the Coral Reef Film, but the other aquarium tracks are beautiful too. You have your choice of sounds for each of the tracks. I personally don't listen to waves as there wouldnt be any underwater, but thats no reason to lower the rating in the least. Some people like the sounds of waves in any situation. For me, I just chose the music tracks - no problem.  The different music is beautiful and calming. The corals themselves are mesmerizing - I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Add in the vibrant tropical fish of many hues (ie: the clown fish) and the colors just hypnotize me into such a relaxed and tranquil state that everything else seems to go away. Yet another great video with amazing photography for the Helsloot company. Great Job once again!",1395360000,,831,4.503311258278146
