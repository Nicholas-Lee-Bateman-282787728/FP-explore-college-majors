4296625,5,B004A8ZX46,I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a mixture of western & modern day adventure. It was entirely NOT as I expected. It was a very exciting movie. A different kind of movie. You can't go wrong with this one.,1298246400,,213,4.219512195121951
4296626,4,B004A8ZX46,"I was a little skeptical about Red Hill as most of the straight to video newer westerns that I haven seen have disappointed me greatly due to poor production quality, bad acting, and badly written scripts.

Red Hill is not your typical western, as it is set in modern day Australia however in small old west type of town. The law in the town of Red Hill did someone wrong some years ago and put him away (jail), well he has escaped and returns to the town of Red Hill for his revenge.

I won't give anything more away on the film.

It really was enjoyable however.

For those of you that avoid movies with bad language, this does have some. Not a lot, however. I think I counted around 5 uses of the ""F Word"". There is no nudity or anything along those lines.

4296627,2,B004A8ZX46,"The acting, pacing and other elements of this film are good, however, the plot is ridiculous.  The entire police force have the sense of a dried-up dog turd.  The killer seems like an expert marksman except for times when the plot calls for him to just miss his target.  So, as I'm watching this I'm thinking that it looks like good cinema and feels like good cinema, but it's a stupid story.  Bummer, it could have been good.",1297209600,3,426,4.423076923076923
4296628,4,B004A8ZX46,"True Blood star Ryan Kwanten plays a young Shane Cooper, a constable on his first day on the job in a small town in Australia.  When an escaped convict (Tom E. Lewis) returns to the town to wreck vengeance, Shane has to keep his wits about as he comes to learn that things truly aren't what they seem.  What makes Red Hill so surprisingly enjoyable is that it is for all rights and purposes a modern-day western with an Aussie backdrop.  The stand-offs, the final showdown, the dusty environment, and the gorgeous Australian outback; all of which combines to make for a surprisingly memorable thriller.  Even more surprising is Kwanten, who after seeing him play an idiot for the past few years on Trube Blood, is a welcome change of pace to see playing an intelligent and heroic character.  All in all, Red Hill is wholeheartedly worth your time if you're looking for an intelligent thriller.",1296259200,8,893,4.698717948717949
4296629,4,B004A8ZX46,We just finished this and it was a good movie.  There was a lot of action and it kept you on your toes the whole movie.  There were scenes that just weren't plausible (many missed opportunities to shoot or grab a gun) but the suspense and storyline kept you interested despite that. Beautiful scenery on top of that.  My husband usually falls asleep during movies at night but he was wide awake through the whole thing.,1296086400,3,419,4.4868421052631575

A new police officer (Kwanten) starts to second guess the reason the entire police force is after escape con Jimmy Conway.  After watching the preview I was expecting a western.  This was and wasn't.  The best way I can explain it is it's like the ""Romeo & Juliet"" with DiCaprio.  The movie is set in present day with dialog from a western.  The cops are called cowboys, etc...  There are some really neat ideas (one scene involves horses coming over a ridge, then same scene with police cars doing the same thing) but overall the movie is a little flat.  I keep waiting for a good new western to be released and it just doesn't seem to happen.  This one did have a neat twist, but I wouldn't call it a typical western.  I give it a C.

Would I watch it again? - No",1295827200,2,933,4.209039548022599

The story follows Kwanten's young police officer character as he transfers into a remote town posting for a quieter life. Unfortunately, his first day happens to coincide with a vengeful native escapee that returns to exact his revenge upon the men and senior lawman (Bisley) of Red Hill. A wonderfully played performance by Tommy Lee as this hate-filled native and standard supporting roles by everyone else allow Kwanten and Lee to interact believably and carry the film.

The Blu specs are a mixed bag, with some of the Aussie landscapes looking clear and colorful. The clarity gets tested with the majority of the last 60 minutes playing out in the dark. There are some falterings, especially the scene with the horse silhouetted against the raining and lightning-crackling sky at a gallop. The DTS is not mixed ideally, and the fluctuations can be more obvious in certain action sequences with some dialogue. There are no special features to speak of, subtitled in Spanish and English only. Region coded A/B.

3.5 stars for a well-made revenge western, .5 for some of the Blu clarity. Plenty of complaints out there that pick apart the flaws (where did the rest of the townsfolk go during this whole day? there has to be more than one phone in that town? the meaning of the panther sub-plot? leaps of understanding about how this young cop had certain gun & car-stealing skills, etc.) but overall I give it the support of being a decent modern western on a non-benchmark BD.

The film is well-mounted with good actors and production values
but lacking a strong story line to make it a worthwhile film making.
It is basically a revenge story of an aboriginal which storyline had been played
to death before.
No suspense has been achieved by all the chasing and gunfights
because you don't know the victim that well and you don't care for
any of the villains.
And what is the significance of that black panther?

Director Patrick Hughes ably establishes the right mood for each scene.  Frankly, this project bears little of the low-budget traits one might expect.

Tommy Lewis (the aborigine convict on the loose) is far more of the badass in this movie and after watching I'm sure you'll agree. It's widely considered to be a ""modern western"", but again, I'm not sure I completely agree on that. Don't expect it to be inline with the western movies you know and love. I'd say its got an outlaw feel to it in the vein of Rambo First Blood.

4296759,4,B004A8ZX46,"Sly Stallone has picked Patrick Hughes to take the directing reigns of the third installment of the Expendables action series. Hughes wrote and directed the intense and moody Australian thriller Red Hill. Personally, I really liked Red Hill and really like this outside the box choice! For those curious here is my review of Red Hill...

Australian thriller is a violent tale of a young cop who moves to a small backwoods town with his pregnant wife in the hopes of a quieter life... until an escaped murderer comes to town with vengeance on his mind. Red Hill is one of those movies that makes you overlook it's minor flaws due to the storytelling skill of the director and the genuine performances of his cast. Patrick Hughes gives his outlaw ""Jimmy"" an almost Michael Meyers persona as he desends upon the quiet town of Red Hill and it's terrified police and citizens, yet, makes him surprisingly human when all is said and done. Young Officer Cooper (Ryan Kwanten) appears a coward at first but, by the end credits, we see the real man beneath who has the courage to do what's right, when it is the right thing to do. And that's what is best about this Aussie gem, Hughes makes makes us think we are watching one kind of movie and then suddenly we realize there's more to it then meets the eye. To say any more would be to ruin a real pleasant surprise.",1366761600,,1357,4.516260162601626

4296761,2,B004A8ZX46,"Red Hill is a usual western tale, a man is arrested, he breaks free and comes back for revenge and things aren't what they seem. Every good guy is a terrible shot and all of them except the main guy are incredibly dumb. The bad guy is mute, startling and an expert marksman until select moments when for no reason he seems to forget how to operate a firearm.

The acting is mediocre except for the main actor, Ryan Kwanten, who does an excellent job portraying a man who can get the crap kicked out of him for an hour and half. The soundtrack is pretty good, the visuals are okay and the blood factor is little over the top on occasion making this seem almost like a cheesy slasher flick but with guns instead of knives. The plot line is simple and doesn't leave you to think about anything afterwards making this overall, a fairly forgettable movie.

It's not a terrible flick but it is predictable and best suited for an afternoon matinee viewing while you're cleaning the house and need something in the background.",1360368000,,1018,4.467741935483871

It's one of those thriller-type movies where you wonder, ""Why doesn't he just _____?"" as all the victims seem incredibly unprepared and helpless even though they know they are in danger.  However, the plot has a nice twist, there's a little bit of humor, and the setting is absolutely gorgeous.",1358899200,,373,4.796875
4296784,4,B004A8ZX46,"Red Hill is set in a rural isolated town in a hilly agricultural region of Australia.  The town is a long way from anywhere else and isn't the laid back posting that a newly relocated from the city police officer Constable Cooper, (Ryan Kwanten) thinks it will be. Cooper can't find where he packed his gun and turns up to work without it not impressing his boss who clearly isn't impressed by Cooper, especially when he tells him he was previously shot tells when he couldn't shoot a child in the city who had a gun.  Cooper's colleagues don't really respect him and send him to a farm on horse instead of using one of the police vehicles, he clearly hasn't ridden before.  However Cooper's day is about to get a whole lot worse, a murderer has escaped from jail and the locals believe he's headed straight for the town with vengeance on his mind.  The rest of the town seems to have been evacuated and it's going to be up to the small group of police officers and locals who have been armed, to confront the dangerous killer when he arrives.

Mild spoilers follow - This is an enjoyable movie but it seemed like there were some plot holes from time to time.  However some of these are cleaned up when you actually work out/find out what is really going on. I still had a few questions by the end though such as why at one stage were bullets able to fired into one character and he didn't flinch at all. Cooper also seems to be seriously injured at one stage too but seems to be able to keep going, although this is a typical action movie thing, think any Bruce Willis movie for example. I also didn't get why he was carrying the wounded officer all over town, what was the point of that when he had nowhere safe to take him and was just increasing the odds of them both being killed? This is where some DVD extras would have been nice like a commentary track or just a Q & A documentary with the director or something like this. Would have also been nice to see a making of, blooper reel, meet the cast or something else too.  Alas there are no extras on the DVD at all.  At times I wasn't sure if this would turn out to be a Stephen King type small town supernatural thriller where some evil demon or something was really in control of events or if this was just a traditional guy coming to town who wants revenge on the police.  As the credits rolled I still wasn't completely sure, especially with the sub plot of the panther urban legend inclusion, but maybe that was just there for misdirection so you didn't work out the main story.

I don't know why some people call this a Western, people where these sorts of hats and attire in rural Australia. Horses are a part of the police force in not just rural but city police forces as well.  They would very much be used in a hilly terrain agricultural and forest police beat.

It doesn't quite rise to classic status.  Not really a western either.  It was okay.  I wouldn't bother watching it a second time though.

He came from a larger municipality where he'd been shot because he couldn't bring himself to draw down on the shooter who was just a young kid. Now things will be nicer for him and his wife who is pregnant a second time after miscarrying the first time. Problem is, a psycho killer has broken out of prison and his heading straight for this quite little hamlet to wipe out the entire police force.

This is a nifty flick. It has a way over-the-top setup established early on, so it's merely a question on how this will all play out. And therein lies the niftiness of it all. It makes a turn in the third act that takes it from being a psycho killer, slasher type flick to a more socially conscious, revenge type flick. I won't spoil things but let me say I liked this route much better than the one I expected to play out from the setup.

Some of the script is fairly clever. Some is a bit too supernatural killer-ish. That a big storm is brewing that never hits is a nice metaphor/backdrop to the story. I also liked that I was given some clues early on as to the switchback in the storyline that I didn't pick up on. It gave me a nice ""ah hah"" moment later on.

The acting and production values are all as good as they have to be to pull this off. It was very smooth and professional with a really good musical score. I liked the ending quite a bit. Too often these kinds of movies can drop the ball on the five yard line but I'm not sure this could have ended any other way.

This is a good, unexpected turn in what could have been a simple minded violent thriller. It's more a three and a half star entry than the three I gave it. So, if you like a new trick on an old dog, give this a shot. It's well worth your time.",1320537600,3,1803,4.084745762711864

4296792,3,B004A8ZX46,"""Red Hill"" is a modern-day take on the Western genre. There is also an allegorical element to the familiar revenge story and cardboard characters (including a mysterious panther). And perhaps a political angle, too. I think I know these things, but to me ""Red Hill"" is just another so-so action movie with lots of clichs.

The film starts slowly with a young police officer Shane Cooper (Ryan Kwanten), who has just relocated to a quiet town of Red Hill with his loving wife Alice (Claire van der Boom) - quiet until Jimmy Conway (Tom E. Lewis), a prisoner serving a life term for murder breaks out of a maximum security prison. Apparently Jimmy Conway is heading for Red Hill, where police officers and townspeople are ready to gun down the escaped convict.

Acting is good and Ryan Kwanten is effective as a likable hero, but it is Steve Bisley as Old Bill, head of the police force, who steals the show. To his credit, writer/director Patrick Hughes (his feature debut) managed to create some tension in action scenes.

But the storyline is predicable, borrowing every narrative device you can think of from other Western movies or crime thrillers. You can see the underwhelming climax from miles away. This might not have been a big problem if the film had been directed with more confidence. Sometimes ""Red Hill"" does not know what it want to do - embrace the conventions or reinvent them. Also, I frankly don't know what the film's weird subplot about a panther is all about.

This is not to say ""Red Hill"" is a bad film. It is just disappointingly weak.",1318377600,2,1560,4.682481751824818
4296843,2,B004A8ZX46,"Red Hill is a modern day Aussie Western with a somewhat multilayered storyline.

The film is weakened however by poor filming and shot selection i.e. it felt like the cameras shot drama rather than an action piece, with slow movement my main objection. There was also a lack of polish, as the burn scars makeup on the escaped Aboriginal convict looked cheap and unconvincing. The film budget presented as thin, and some of the actors looked out of place performing action genre.

I did find myself entertained with some clever scenes though, in particular some diversionary tactics used by the escaped convict during a few shootouts.

This isn't an Australian film I would recommend watching, as it reminds me of many bad Aussie films from the 1970s and 1980s. But it does have some strength to it, which includes twists in the narrative.

4296846,4,B004A8ZX46,"This sets itself up as a `Western' and does not fail to deliver. This is a modern day take on such greats as `High Noon'. It tells the story of a young cop Shane Cooper (Ryan Kwanten), who moves to the back of nowhere to not jeopardise the pregnancy of his wife, as city life can be so stressful.

On his first day his new boss ridicules him for being late, not having a gum and a past indiscretion when he failed to shoot a kid. That incident ended up with him being shot instead. This is the town time forgot, but Jimmy Conway (Tom E. Lewis) most certainly hasn't. He is an Aborigine, who has been jailed for murdering his own wife. He has just escaped from a high security prison, and the townsfolk are adamant he is heading their way, and they get tooled up. They are ordered to shoot on sight.

Shane is told he has to go to some outback farm and the only source of transportation available is a horse. He does not sit too well in the saddle and is given the advice `just look where you want to go, and the horse will follow.

There is also a sub plot about a roaming panther and the aboriginal, sacred ground atop the nearby mountain. The rest is pure western with Jimmy turning up and the shooting begins.

I really enjoyed this from start to finish, there are some minor plot holes, but not so bad as to ruin my enjoyment. It is well paced, some may find it slow, but I like the fact that time had been taken over the cinematography and the direction helps to build up tension. Patrick Hughes has done a great job, and as he wrote it too, this has obviously been a labour of love. This is not an all action shoot em up, but is a very watchable, well made film and praise should go to Screen Australia too for co funding, I hope Mr Hughes does not take too long for his next one.",1309996800,4,1786,4.123563218390805

RED HILL benefits from the acting of its three leads.  TRUE BLOOD's Ryan Kwanten displays a wide range going from a timid Barney Fife to a rugged Clint Eastwood.  Steve Bisley shines as the steely police chief, while Tom E. Lewis is remarkable as the villain with only one line of dialogue which packs a powerful punch.
While the plot twist isn't entirely surprising, the journey there is impressive.  I recommend RED HILL for its originality and production values.",1307059200,3,993,4.777777777777778
4296848,4,B004A8ZX46,"Not ""The Outback"" but actually set and filmed in the seldom-seen Southern Alpine region of South-East Australia. This film is well worth watching and more plausible than some think (see my ""Comment"" no. 3 under Steve Kuehl's critique on this page). Real political issues are woven into the film, such as the proposed high-speed rail line and restrictive highland access for cattle grazing. This gives more ""local"" edge to a tense, well-paced film. The only real inconsistency (to Australians) would be a ""shortage"" of Police vehicles requiring the main character having to go horseback to check-out a report on his first day.
Anyone who enjoys this film should also consider ""The Proposition"", ""Dead Heart"" and ""Two Hands"".",1306540800,7,723,5.188034188034188
4296849,4,B004A8ZX46,"If you're in a western kind of mood, but want something more modern, this is a good choice. Set in Australia, it involves a newcomer taking on the job of deputy in a small town. He's treated like a unwanted kid for half the movie, but when the going gets tough, and corruption is revealed, the new kid turns into the Rambo of the bunch. A little slow in the middle but still worth the time.",1302652800,,390,4.144736842105263
4296850,3,B004A8ZX46,"This movie almost got there. It truly has an old-fashioned Western feel, right down to the horses in the po-dunk town it's set in but it misses the mark by just a bit which is a shame because buried in the morass was a modern day western classic. Ryan Kwanten is on the verge of bleeding to death throughout most of the film, the townspeople evaporate at dusk it seems and seriously, the shortage of phones is just unbelievable. Don't get me started on the cheesy panther. But it's an entertaining film with good acting by Kwanten and the scenery is beautiful but I already mentioned Kwanten, ba dum dum. Really, Australia is fantastic looking. I won't say it's worth owning or even adding to your Netflix queue (well, maybe it is) but is defintely worth a rainy afternoon and a big bowl of popcorn if you find it on.",1302566400,,817,4.453333333333333
4296851,5,B004A8ZX46,"A subperb, heart-pounding, well-acted film filled with drama, suspense, and depth of character rarely seen on today's screens.  Think of ""No Country for Old Men"" and triple the suspense level.  This film's ""villain"" outscares them all--even the county police force has good reason to be terified.

Yet, this is not a slasher movie in the usual sense, but rather a nuanced tale of bravery, heroism, danger, betrayal and redemption.  The violence  is graphic but not gratuitous.  Although this film is rather long, one wished for it to go on longer. Yes, there are a few logical flaws in the plot, but for its entertainment value my overall reaction can still be summarized in four words, ""Don't Dare Miss It.""",1299456000,,708,4.907563025210084
4296852,1,B004A8ZX46,"(1.) So bad even my $1.10 rental fee feels truly wasted.
(2.) Fast forward through 90% and you won't have missed anything.
(3.) If the Aussie backdrop and scenes are memorable then you haven't seen any US western state hilly backcountry scrub brush.
(4.) Unimaginative stereotypic storyline consists of pregnant wife who appears in the first and final couple of minutes for some reason; a city cop becoming a country sheriff and spends a lot of time walking around the countryside with a few episodes of his first experience with a horse while bleeding most of the time; bad guy who turns out not to be bad guy despite killing a half dozen or so townsfolk even when the townsfolk have guns pointed at him and somehow they don't shoot or miss at point blank range just before they die.
(5.) Inconsistencies (too many to list): People who hang themselves don't first fall like a stiff board; panthers are forest hunters and don't live for a hundred years; back up sheriffs don't suddenly appear lined up in vehicles on a backcountry hill and shoot with accuracy from a couple of thousand feet at night and know not to shoot the good guy who looks just as bad as the bad guy.
(6.) Robotic script reading style acting compensated with cinematography that was stolen from Sergio's spaghetti western school of film.
(7.) Five/four star reviewers must have lived their lives in city townhouses and are watching their first movie.",1299024000,3,1422,4.737903225806452

8419714,3,B004A8ZX46,"Just an ok movie.  It had some promise but a few problems that would frustrate those who like Westerns.  One issue was it fell into the PC trap of painting the noble savage as good (this time aborigine) and the evil white men as bad.  Apparently, white guilt has found its way to Australia.  But let's forgive that insulting and lazy story arc.  Another issue was the believe-ability of some of the shooting scenes in the movie.  It was about as bad as the movie Commando in this respect.  You have to pretend that small town officers or even folks in a small town have no experience with fire arms and lack much common sense.  You also will have to believe this bad/good guy also is a great marksmen and can make amazing shots on call.  But that part is more common in Westerns so I can accept that.  What is most frustrating about this movie is it had potential to be a really good movie but settled for much less.  Go see other top westerns long before you consider this one.  If you come into this movie with cynical expectations, you probably have a much better chance of enjoying it.",1484956800,,1089,4.36318407960199
