8168376,5,B000MFZO3G,"This is a tape that has some of the opening videos that are shown at the start of most Ozzy Osbourne concerts. It has Ozzy taking part in everything from an Alanis Morrisette video (isn't it ironic), to Ozzy joining the Beatles to jam on a song. If you have ever been to an Ozzy concert, then you have seen some of these. The clips on this tape are fairly old. They are from Ozzy shows from several years back. It is still awesome to have this tape in my Ozzy collection.",1322438400,,471,4.130434782608695
