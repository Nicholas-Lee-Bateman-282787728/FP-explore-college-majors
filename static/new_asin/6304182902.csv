If you're hoping for Dragon Box quality it may be iffy as it's unclear what source is used, it may be possible because this movie was NEVER released uncut but that's just a guess for now.",1289606400,3,728,4.62015503875969
802265,5,6304182902,"I'm not sure why Funimation is releasing this so-called movie in this way.

Curse of the Blood Rubies is an official Dragon Ball movie. However, it is a movie made mostly from previously used footage taken from the first thirteen episodes of Dragon Ball. Though it's midly entertaining, very mildly, for true fans to watch I don't see why they are releasing this movie on DVD by itself. Maybe if they included it in a set with all the other Dragon Ball movies (there's only 4) or even in a 2 movie for the price of one deal (like they did with the much more enjoyable Dragon Ball Z movies, which unlike this movie were entirely original stories with entirely original animation).

At least the price is low at only thirteen dollars but if you really want to see it that bad you can probably find it online, it doesn't merit repeated viewings in my opinion. For fans who really want to own it I'd even suggest buying a used copy of the old Lions Gate released set The Saga of Goku because the movie is included as well as the original television dub of the 13 episodes from back in 1995, which because they are edited and were dubbed in 1995 are actually quite fun to compare to the uncut episodes.

I'm not hating on this movie simply making it known to those wondering that this is NOT really an original Dragon Ball movie in the style of the Dragon Ball Z movies. This is mostly reused animation that retells the Emperor Pilaf saga (Dragon Ball's first 13 episodes) but only covers the crucial parts and replaces Emperor Pilaf searching for the Dragon Balls with a monsterous king who was cursed by the blood rubies to always eat but never be full and he needs the dragon balls to wish the curse away. Goku meets Bulma, meets the terrible Oolong and meets Yacha the desert bandit but all in very different and condensed tellings when compared to how it happened in the series. This sounds like a fun premise with the king and all but for me the reused animation kept it from being enjoyable.

Still maybe Funimation will do something with this to prove me wrong, if they do please correct me. Based on the low price of 13 dollars I think you're getting what you pay for which is neither meant to be good or bad, it just is what it is.

* For those interested in Dragon Ball movies the best one, also a reimagining of the original thirteen episodes, is the tenth anniversary special Path to Power. It not only retells the beginning of Goku's quest for the dragon balls but reimagines it. All with brand new high quality animation, animation as great as the final sagas of DBZ, it shows us Goku meeting Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, Roshi and facing down against the Red Ribbon Army rather than the less imposing Emperor Pilaf.",1272240000,7,2720,4.453815261044177
802266,1,6304182902,"Before I go on and rant why we true Dragon Ball fans need to see this uncut and in Japanese, I want to correct some false facts made in earlier reviews. This movie was based on the first thirteen episodes of Dragon Ball, not the other way around. People are thinking that this film was what started the Dragon Ball series. The TV series is based on the manga, and this film is based on the TV series.

Okay, so I'm not going to give you a review of this film because I honestly have never seen it. Let me just say this, don't go out and search for this VHS release because it is a waste of your time and money. This movie is heavily edited and includes the Ocean Group cast in it. It is not uncut with FUNimation's own cast like their more recent releases. I really could care less what dub is on this release since I am a fan of the original Japanese version, but I just wanted to let all you dub fans out there know.

Anyway, FUNimation is currently remastering the Dragon Ball series for season box set releases. While the remastering is nothing compared to the Japanese ""Dragon Boxes"" and not much overall, it is still watchable and you can see certain episodes uncut for the first time. It has been said by a FUNimation representative at a convention that they might be releasing this movie in a season set, but can you really trust everything you hear at a convention, especially from a FUNimation rep?

FUNimation will also be releasing American versions of the Z ""Dragon Boxes"" starting in November. This is the true remastering of the series. I am recommending this release to every Dragon Ball fan that wants to see the show as it was ""meant to be seen."" So, FUNimation hasn't stated whether or not they have gotten the Dragon Ball TV series or films in ""Dragon Box"" form, so don't hold your breath for that release. If you really want to see this movie in Japanese, buy the movie from a Japanese site (like Amazon Japan or CDJapan), and if you want to purchase the film in English, wait for FUNimation to release it remastered... just don't get this!

Thank you for reading my little review. Oh yeah, you are probably wondering where the actual review is! I have only read a summary of the film so I can't say much about it. It sounds like a great film and I recommend everyone go buy it if FUNimation ever re-releases it!",1254614400,3,2333,4.368663594470046
802267,4,6304182902,"This movie was excellent except for one part, it didn't show Goku turning into an Oozaru and smashing everything. Other than that, it was vary good. I especially liked the fight between Goku and Yamcha. But the introduction to Master roshi wasn't that great and he didn't even say that Goku could have the flying Nimbus.
  But I still recommend this video to any diehard DB or even DBZ fan. I'm gonna buy movie two next!",1016582400,,420,4.5131578947368425
802268,5,6304182902,I first found out about Dragonball when it came on the CartoonNetwork this year. It was so cool... When I got home I watched this movie. It was just plumb awesome!,1002672000,,163,4.290322580645161
802269,4,6304182902,"My nephew got my brother hooked on the Dragonball Z saga, and I got hooked by him.  Wathching the series up through the Freiza saga, and now into the android saga, I became a faithful watcher, tuning in every day.  On one of the episodes, they talked about an episode from when Goku was a child, when he first fought and defeated the Red Ribbon Army, and that got me interested in seeing how it all started, so I got this video.
The video is a good introduction to the world of Dragonball, giving a first look at Goku, and his introduction to other friends: Bulma, Yamcha, and Master Roshi.  Plus, there's the introduction of Goku's first learning the Kamehame-ha, one of his most powerful attacks.
This video was the movie on which the original Dragonball series was based, since the series then starts off with Goku meeting Bulma for the first time again, and the other characters later. In it, Goku and friends are on a mission to rescue a kingdom from its king, who has become changed into a greedy monster from his passion for collecting blood rubies.  He's also searching for the dragon balls to use for his own purpose, so our heroes are off to stop him.  It's a fun filled, and quick adventure, so if you've liked any of the other shows, I recommend you pick up this video too.",971913600,14,1285,4.451063829787234

802514,2,6304182902,"Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies is the first film released for the Dragon Ball franchise.  Curse of the Blood Rubies has to basically be looked at as an ""alternate timelime"" story for the Dragon Ball universe.  This 50-minute film modifies the initial story arc from the original television series, and replaces Emperor Pilaf with a character named King Gurumes to serve as the antagonist for the piece.  King Gurumes is the king of the Gurumes Kingdom, who became greedy for the Blood Rubies buried in his kingdom, and became a gluttonous monster.  In addition to the Blood Rubies, King Gurumes is also wanting to obtain all seven Dragon Balls, so he can satiate his gluttony with the best-tasting food in the world.

In this film, Goku meets Bulma, Oolong, Yamucha, Pur-Eh, Master Roshi, and a new character named Pansy (who is from the Gurumes Kingdom).  How Goku meets Bulma in the film is rather similar to the original series.  As for the other characters, their introductions are noticeably different.  Overall, I thought that the characters of Bulma, Yamucha, and Master Roshi really lose their importance in this re-telling.  In the series, Bulma is portrayed as a very gifted inventor and invented the Dragon Radar.  However, in this film, King Gurumes' henchmen already have their own Dragon Radar, which means that Bulma's isn't as major of a deal.  Bulma's roles in this film are ultimately to provide Goku the initial information on the Dragon Balls, to serve as a chauffeur, and be a foil for Yamucha.  Yamucha's character is also diminished quite a bit in this film, and it's hard to find it believable that he follows the other characters to King Gurumes' castle for the climax.  Master Roshi's role in this film is almost non-existent.  The main purpose for the group to go there is for Goku to see Roshi perform the Kamehameha and learn it.  Outside of that, Roshi really doesn't do anything that's terribly important.

When it comes to the story of the film, I thought the pacing of the film felt a little choppy.  In addition, there are times when you question what is going on; the best example of this is when Goku sees Bulma's Dragon Ball and thinks it's his, but Bulma corrects him by saying that his ball has four stars instead of two.  I question this, because in the film, Bulma has just met Goku, and has never seen his Dragon Ball before.  How would she know what his looks like?  In addition, King Gurumes and the whole Blood Ruby storyline doesn't seem to be very well developed, even though the Blood Rubies are in the title of the film.

When I watched this DVD, I saw the film with the Japanese audio and English subtitles.  The audio for the Japanese was not mastered very well.  When it comes to the picture quality, the opening credits looked incredibly grainy.  Outside of that, though, the video looked somewhat decent.  As for extras, all that is included are trailers.  The trailers included on this disc are for: Fullmetal Alchemist, One Piece, Kaleido Star, Ragnarok, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Black Butler, and Dragon Ball.

Overall, I would much rather watch the initial story arc from the original Dragon Ball anime series.  Personally, I can only truly recommend this release for the die-hard Dragon Ball fans that must own everything on DVD.  If you're a more casual fan, then I would suggest only picking this up if you really like the film.  If you do purchase this film, be sure to look around for it at a relatively cheap price.  When my husband purchased it, he found it for $10.  Honestly, I would say that somewhere between $10 and $15 is a reasonable price for this release.  I would consider anything more than $15 to be a rip-off.

I wrote this review after receiving a copy of this DVD as a gift from my husband.",1302566400,,3778,4.674242424242424

802516,5,6304182902,"""Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies"" (Japanese title ""Doragon Boru Shenron no Densetsu"" or ""Dragon Ball: The Legend of Shenlong"") was the first theatrical release in the popular ""Dragon Ball"" series by Toriyama Akira.

The film essentially repackages the first story arc in the ""Dragon Ball"" series, substituting out Emperor Pilaf for the much larger King Gurumes (King Gourmet).  In ""Curse of the Blood Rubies,"" King Gurumes is a gross monster who has devastated his kingdom in order to appease his colossal appetite. Once human, his desire for the Blood Rubies caused him to dig up the farms and houses of his people, and cursed him to be continually hungry but never satisfied.  He learns of a legend that might give some relief, when he hears of the legend of the dragon Shen Long who will grant a wish to anyone who can gather all of the Dragon Balls.  King Gurumes sends out his minions Pasta and Major Bongo to get the DragonBalls, which brings him into conflict with Dragon Ball holders Goku and Bulma, and their companions Yamcha, Oolong, Puer and Master Roshi.

If you are a Dragon Ball super-fan, then ""Curse of the Blood Rubies"" might be a little too familiar.  The purpose of the theatrical release film was to give kids a chance to catch up to the Dragon Ball story that they might have missed on TV.  If you are new to Dragon Ball and want to check out what all the fuss is about, then this is perfect.  All of the main characters are introduced here for the first time in a self-contained story that gives a feel for the series.

Like all of the ""Dragon Ball"" series, ""Curse of the Blood Rubies"" took quite a butchering at the hands of editors trying to make it ""kid-friendly"" for American audiences (even thought it was originally produced for young Japanese children).  On top of that, rights issues between Lions Gate and Funimation meant that an uncut bilingual release of the film was prohibited for many years.  Now, Funimation has finally aquired the full rights to the film and the full movie can be released for the first time in the US.

Aside from the full release, Funimation has gone back and re-dubbed ""Curse of the Blood Rubies"" with their Dragon Ball cast including Colleen Clinkenbeard as Goku.  This is good news to fans who like the dubbed version.

""Curse of the Blood Rubies"" will also be available as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-4-Movie-Pack/dp/B004DMIISC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball: 4 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;that contains all of the DragonBall theatrical releases.",1294012800,4,2587,4.986046511627907

7863945,4,6304182902,"Be sure to not that if you are buying the VHS version of this release, you are not getting the recent Funimation redub of this film with the Kai cast, but the previous dub done by Ocean Group. If you have the Rock the Dragon boxset or previous Pioneer releases, you will note the recurring cast. I found it extremely interesting to find out that Ocean had dubbed this movie so long ago. I wonder why they never aired it on Toonami? The VHS version is considerably edited but this helps differentiate it from the later uncut FUNi redub, so it make an interesting viewing even if you have the other version. It's also interesting because this is the first english appearance of the franchise since the seriously inaccurate and edited dub from the eighties done by Harmony Gold. So it's a very interesting part of history. Despite the editing it's a fun film to watch.

As far as the DVD version, which is the newer dub, the film is still great. Also since it features the Kai cast so for right now it is the closest thing we have in the US to a Kai release of Dragon Ball. it's better than nothing, in that respect.",1443657600,,1113,4.3768115942028984

This film covers a story of an evil king who's desire was to eat something spectacularly tasty but that's something everyone pretty much knows.

What I'd like to focus this on would be the picture quality and audio quality.

PQ:
+ The image is clean and remastered.
+ They've used the ""correct colours"" which look nice in perspective.
- Unfortunately FUNimation over-saturated the colours making it look dark and have detail loss.
- Other than this release for an English Uncut Dragon Ball Movie #1 there's nothing else sadly.
- No Japanese credits, but at the very least they made the film's title good looking in English.

AQ:
- The Japanese audio is very very muffled so be aware of it rather than be shocked by it.
- The English dub has the voices of FUNimation's Kai cast unfortunately (would have preferred Stephany Nadolny).
+ English dub is in 5.1 DD which is fantastic if you like the English Kai dub cast.

So overall, while this release isn't perfect it's still perfectly serviceable.",1396310400,,1377,6.26984126984127
