Pratchett's writing and plotting are better by several orders of magnitude in his later books. And the later books are less overtly satiric. The highly episodic nature of these first two novels must have made them tough to script. But, over all, this is a decent effort at a difficult task.

The casting is generally good. Sean Astin is quite good as Twoflower, the Disc's first tourist. He was a controversial choice because Twoflower is from the Discworld's equivalent of China in the hearts of Pratchett fans, but Astin brings such strong skills to the role that it all works well. David Jason as the failed wizard - excuse me, ""Wizzard"" - is less successful. He's simply too old. And the script down plays Rincewind's strongest trait: cowardice. This is a man who knows how to say ""Don't kill me"" in a hundred different languages. Jason just doesn't fit the character. Jeremy Irons is superb as the Patrician. David Bradley as Cohen is at once not old enough and too old. He is obviously much younger than the 92 years Cohen claims. He tries to ""act"" older by being slower in fights, something that would surely have killed Cohen long ago if it were right. Tim Curry is completely right as the power-hungry, scheming Trymon, a larger role in the movie than in the books.

Another problem is that Color of Magic/Light Fantastic cries out for a big special effects budget. Let's just say that The Mob, the movie's producers, didn't have Peter Jackson's budget. Except, perhaps, for the Librarian, they do reasonably well with what they had, and the final few scenes are especially good.

Still, even a so-so Pratchett movie is still a Pratchett movie. If all of the jokes aren't there, and some destinations skipped or somewhat changed, there are enough laughs to remind you why Pratchett is a world treasure.

Reportedly, The Mob will make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-Postal/dp/0060502932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going Postal</a>&nbsp;next, a much later, much better written Pratchett novel. I look forward to it, but in the meantime Color of Magic, if flawed, is still great fun. And the flaws may just be, like octarine, the color of magic, a pigment of my imagination.

3556032,5,B001EM1E94,"I was very pleased with this movie, actually the disk has a part 1 and part 2, so there are two movies.  The acting is very good, the story is great, and the photo work is first rate.  Part one is The Color of Magic (The Colour of Magic) by Terry Pratchett, a fantasy satire.  This is the first book in the discworld series.  Part 2 is The Light Fantastic the second book in the diskworld series.  Together they make the full story.  A great way to release a part one and part two of a story, together on the same disk, released at the same time.",1248134400,3,546,4.05607476635514

Fans everywhere have their own mental images of all the major characters and scenes, and at least some of those images are sure to differ from the movie's. So, I was not surprised to see that this Rincewind wasn't my Rincewind. Tim Curry (was he really&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frank-N-Furter/dp/B00004U8P9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frank-N-Furter</a>&nbsp;all those years ago?) made a decent sneering badguy, but only so-so senior wizard.

I was happily suprised, however, by the way they handled my all-time favorite Discworld character: the Luggage. Twoflower was dead on, and Cohen and Bethan were pretty close (I mean, not just close to each other), and Jeremy Irons did for Vetinari what Alan Rickman did for Snape. And ... well, lots of things came out well enough for a rousing good time.

Perhaps some of Pratchett's conversational sparkle dimmed just a bit on the way to the small screen. It happens, I guess, and the nigglers are going to niggle no matter how good it is. On the whole, the BBC did a very nice job with the relatively large budget applied to this made-for-TV production.

3556034,4,B001EM1E94,"This is the second attempt to make a movie out of a Terry Pratchett novel and it succeeds rather well.  In this case, the movie is based on the first two novels in the 'Discworld' series, 'The Colour of Magic' and 'The Light Fantastic'.

Rincewind (David Jason), an inept wizard, is expelled from Unseen University. On a dare, he snuck a look at the Octavo, the book used to create the world, and one of the eight great spells lodged in his head.
At the same time, Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives in Ankh-Morpork to ""look at it"".  He's the Discworld's first tourist and he travels with the Luggage, a box made of sapient pearwood that moves about on hundreds of little legs and will follow it's owner everywhere.

After conning Twoflower, Rincewind is dragged to the Patrician's palace and ordered by Lord Vetinari (Jeremy Irons) to guide Twoflower safely through the city.

Twoflower, introducing the concept of fire insurance to Ankh-Morpork, inadvertently causes the entire city to burn down and he and Rincewind escape and Rincewind is plunged into several life threatening situations which he survives by sheer luck.

The good parts of this movie are Jeremy Irons as the Patrician and Tim Curry as Ymper Trymon, second in command of one of the eight orders of wizardry at the university. Both play their roles with relish and Curry's performance is as good, if not better, than that of Cardinal Richelieu in 'The 3 Musketeers'.

The bad parts? Well, a lot of the good scenes in both novels are left out. There is no travelling shop, no Hrun the Barbarian, no flying rock and no Tethis the sea troll. There is also no gingerbread cottage or broomstick flying.

Also, they unfortunately chose a white actor to portray Twoflower, when it's made clear in both 'The Colour of Magic' and 'Interesting Times' that Twoflower is Chinese. A real shame, but Sean Astin does a fantastic job at portraying Twoflower's attitude of looking at the world through rose coloured glasses.

And they got Cohen the Barbarian's (David Bradley) teeth wrong.

Although this movie takes a while to get going, it does get funnier as it goes along and there are some great one-liners.  ""I am having a near Rincewind experience.""

Christopher Lee reprises the voice of Death, as he did in the animated versions of 'Soul Music' and 'Wyrd Sisters' and he has some of the best parts in the movie.

Aside from the little annoyances, the movie is quite good, the actors are superb, it's got all the wittiness you'd expect from Pratchett, and I loved it.",1240012800,136,2523,4.759174311926605
3556035,4,B001EM1E94,"Terry Pratchett movies have a hefty challenge ahead of them -- they have to maintain the wit and quick plotting of Pratchett's books, and also juggle a lot of characters and subplots. And ""The Colour of Magic,"" adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is is more than up to the challenge. It's no ""Hogather"" -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.

Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to ""look at it."" But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.

After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.

Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.

Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books (""The Colour of Magic"" and ""the Light Fantastic""), but ""Colour of Magic"" is not quite as funny or tightly-written as the previous Pratchett miniseries, the delightfully wacky and gripping holiday story ""Hogfather."" The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and scheming around the University).

But despite these drawbacks, ""Colour of Magic"" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through. Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.

Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue (""You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?""), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness. Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the ""hero.""

Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure (""We're going to run out of world!"" ""I have to see that!"") as if he isn't entirely aware that reality is full of danger. And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.

While the direction is often looser than it could be, ""The Colour of Magic"" is a delightfully clever romp across Pratchett's lovable flat planet. If nothing else, it will make you glad you're not Rincewind.",1239926400,37,3951,5.152886115444618

3556037,3,B001EM1E94,"I waited over a year for a chance to see this film, and when the opportunity finally arose, I was sadly disappointed.  A strange disjointedness takes over and for those who haven't read the books - there is no hope to follow the tale.  For those who have read the books - they are changed, warped and some of our favorite parts are removed.

Though ""Hogfather"" was no awardwinner, it was faithful to the book and held a certain charm that lovers of the series will be thrilled with.  The Color of Magic sadly lacks this charm.  Through no fault of the excellent cast - Discworld never comes to life in this film.  Perhaps it is the rushed condensing of two books into one film, or perhaps it is as simple as Pratchett's humor not translating properly to the new medium.

Each of the characters seems close enough to what we envisioned... but they seem to wander hopelessly through the scenery with little direction and even less purpose.  Important scenes like - the trolls on the mountain are cut down to almost nothing with no explination at all.  When Cohen finally gets his dentures, there is no reason for them to sparkle because it is never said that troll's teeth are made of diamonds.  The luggage is almost forgotten and becomes simply a mobile set piece.  The scenes at the Dragon's castle are pointless and the concept of the imaginary dragons coming to life is passed over completely - making the disappearance of the dragon rather odd to the viewer.  The scene with Bel Sham Haroth is completely left out, as well as the card game with Twoflower, War, Famine, Pestilence and Death.

In all, the scenes with the greatest opportunities for humor were cut, and those that were left were patched together with no rhyme or reason.  Sadly I cannot recommend this movie, though avid Discworld fanatics will still go out of their way to watch it... just know that there is not a lot here to cling to.

Easily a PG rating - my 7 year old watched it with us and seemed to enjoy it, though he didn't ask if we could ""keep it"" like he normally does.",1238371200,2,2050,4.487870619946092

3556088,5,B001EM1E94,"I've read the books and seen the movie on TV. Now I am going to buy the movie. I may get a second and third copy to use as Christmas gifts. It's about as good as it could be compressed down as it is. The two books could easily be a mini series each. Rincewind's peeking at the Octavio allowed one of the 8 great spells to jump from the pages of the book and lodge itself in his head, leaving no room for any other spells. He's a wizard, he knows a spell but he can't do anything with it and can't learn other spells so he's essentially powerless. He's also rather inept in most ways except that he has a real, world class ability to survive stupid situations that his ineptness gets him into. This isn't really brought out in the movie version. They don't have time. The Patrician is well played. The Death persona, being, whatever, voice is marvelous but the face not moving while it's speaking isn't so great.  I really liked the expression on Rincewind's face when he finally understood that Twoflower had sold an in-sewer-ants policy to the tavern owner on the tavern and he just knew that the owner would burn his tavern in a heartbeat for the 200 gold pieces it was insured for, and that the whole town would probably go with it since everything is made of wood. The dragons were cool but cut way to short. In whole, this is Terry Pratchett's silly, hilarious, humor brought pretty well to the video market.",1438387200,,1413,4.3726235741444865

I particularly love the irony in Ankh-Morpork having a guild that oversees everything; an Assassins Guild, and a Thieves Guild, a Beggar's Guild, etc.  The ideas and the satire Mr. Pratchett presents in his books are quite enjoyable and translate fairly well to the screen.

While it drags at times (a sequence with Dragons is particularly poor in my opinion), and I left feeling uneven the first time I watched it, with the 2nd go around it gets progressively better as you notice things you didn't before and you get used to some of the ""in-jokes"" (like in - sur - ance which falls flat the first time, gets funnier on the 2nd viewing).  For the price, you ought to get it, and the DVD looks pretty spiffy even with a Blu-ray player (doesn't look washed out).

In the first place, despite listing for ""Region B/2, Region A/1"" it still would not show any picture at all on my Panasonic BluRay disc player. It would not even after I made the special effort of updating the player's firmware to latest and greatest. On pressing PAUSE it would show a still frame but never moving ones on PLAY. I had no choice whatsoever but to rip the whole thing to an emensely huge MKV file and watch it on my 52-inch Panasonic plasma screen using my PC and the VLC software. Once I did that it was great, but what a bother.

Of secondary annoyance is that while it's in the original English (my native language) it comes with subtitles ONLY for Dutch. Being rather iffy of hearing during scenes where there is background noise, music and such I very like to have English subtitles also available. So does my wife. So aside from having to rip the video to MKV it was further necessary to hunt, download and slightly edit an SRT file to get English subtitles to display (again via VLC).

So, all in all, I'm glad to now have this wonderful show in full 1080p via a BluRay edition now that the bother is done with, had I known it would be so much trouble I really would have made due with a plain DVD in its place.",1381190400,,1366,4.226053639846743

For those of you haven't encountered Discworld, it is Terry Pratchett's take on the Sword and Sorcery genre...think Conan The Barbarian with a good dose of humor.  This is primarily the tale of a never-do-well wizard in perpetual training who has gotten himself involved with a powerful book of spells...in a very odd fashion.  He encounters, Twoflower, the first tourist to the Kingdom from a fabulously wealthy land at the opposite end of the Disc.  Did I forget to mention Discworld is flat and carried on the back of four elephants which in turn ride on the back of a giant turtle?  The tourist and his magical trunk are innocents abroad and become the responsibility of the inept wizard...on pain of death.  Twoflower has a list of things to see and do and drags the hapless wizard into imminent danger and potentially grisly death at every turn.  Did I also forget to mention that the hapless wizard is inhabited by an immensely powerful spell which could doom the world?  The masters of the Wizarding university, led by an unscrupulous and murderously upwardly mobile wizard are looking for the spell and consequently looking for our errant tourguide.  A very funny and immaginative story which can be enjoyed by all ages.  If you are a fan of sword and sorcery, be prepared for a number of in-jokes poking fun at various famous characters.

One thing that'll make you sit bolt upright is the ending, which is abrupt, unexpected, thought-provoking, and, well, French in character.

However, thinking back on it, I don't think the movie ""earned"" that ending:  it was not that coherent.  It seemed rather that they didn't know how to tie the two story threads together and so simply ended it by rolling the credits.  I found this highly dissatisfying and weird for a movie that was so light-hearted in character:  it was almost like it was a betrayal of what went before, rather than a completion or a resolution.

If you are a Terry Pratchett fan, please skip this movie. It you're not a Pratchett fan you MUST skip this movie for fear of being turned off of Discworld entirely.

Sean Astin what were you thinking? BTW Twoflower is supposed to be Asian. And the sickly and bloated appearance by Tim Curry is just kind of sad.  Jeremy Irons brief appearance as Ventinari works well if a bit predictable but thats about the only highlight of this mess.

My wife and I are absolute Pratchet fanatics. We own every book. Listen to Nigel Planer's wonderful audio recordings over and over. We even enjoy the cartoon adaptations. While the animation is a little crude, the voice work is excellent. The Hogfather made-for-TV movie is pretty good, certainly A-for-effort.

But Color of Magic is an embarrassment.  We sat through the first two-thirds of the movie hoping against hope that it would get better. It didn't.  As it blundered on into it's second hour, we sadly gave up in disgust.

Discworld is a vast and wonderful place, but this movie does no justice. Please avoid if you're a fan or not!",1314316800,8,1086,4.654450261780105

  The only problem I had with the entire movie (and now this couold have been the TV set I was watching it on) but it seemed that Christopher Lee's voice as Death was over-reverbarated. There were a couple of moments where it was kind of hard to understand what he was saying. Everything else in the movie was wonderful, and like I said it coulde have been the set I was watching it on (as it was an older tube set and I remember watching it on a HD projector and thought it was fine on there).

It is in 2 parts, 1.5 hrs each.  It is well-acted, finely directed, and terrifically scripted.  You'll recognize Sean Astin, who played Samwise Gamje (sp?) the Hobbit in LOTR, a traveller who stumbles in to a fantastical & literally magical adventure; and then there's Tim Curry, the evil & plotting wizard.  Not to give it away, but Astin has a magical walking chest full of gold that looks out for him, and acquires a 'guide' - a not so magical & bumbling wizard, who finds his powers, and they go on a quest all over this 'far out' world set upon a celestial Tortoise's back.  * MY SON IS 15 NOW, NO LONGER GOES FOR GREASY KID STUFF, BUT HEY- HE ENJOYED THE DICKENS OUTA THIS ONE HERE! * The two travel to the edge of their world, learn to fly, swim, take a short trip into space; and eventually learn that they must somehow find, or ""set free,"" a lost or missing 'spell' but it's missing from ""The Octavio.""

For readers of Discworld: it mashes several stories together all in one go, which does end up being a bit confusing, but at the same time somehow it follows a continuous, fairly stable plot thread. Perfect little moments of memorable dialogue, and PERFECT selection of characters. Was a little disappointed that the Patrician came off so moustache-stroking, but finding a perfect Patrician is no doubt nigh-on impossible. Rincewind was BRILLIANT and Twoflower was amazingly cheek-pinchingly ADORABLE. I never saw him as adorable in the books, but oh my is he, and oh how it works for him!

For those unfamiliar with Discworld and Terry Prachett, this is a FABULOUS fantasy creation that pokes fun at the entire genre, the entire human race, politics, myth, and culture. If you've ever made fun of fantasy stocks-in-trades like the muscle-rippling hero, the pompous gray-bearded mages, magical artifacts, or perpetually unafraid heroes--this is for you.

Even if you haven't, watch it anyway, and then realize that the movie is in truth nothing but a brief glimpse--a teaser, if you will--into the marvelous world of Terry Prachett, and go buy every last one of his books in a frenzy of glee.

The sharp, almost underhanded wit utilized in the dialogue is only the beginning: imagine the entire world being narrated that way.",1301529600,3,1347,5.113636363636363

As an avid fan of Mr. Pratchett's work the movie is worth having.

Tim Curry has had a productive, brilliant career.  He no doubt is one of todays superior character actors.  His portral of the villian wizard Trymon is both synister and humorous.

Death is a delightful droll entity in both this movie and in Hogsfather.

Personally, I love British shows of this type and would place this one in my top twenty. While I HIGHLY recommend ""Hogfather"" (the first Terry Pratchet adaptation), not every effort can be a home run. The ""Color of Magic"" earns a simple 'recommended' from me only because the story doesn't pull me in quite as effectively on screen as it does in print.

The movie actually encompasses two of the books (which themselves could have been released together as one long piece). The performances are good and I can never pass up anything Tim Curry does.

The Discworld is a strange place filled with magic instead of science (they have cameras but they work differently: a tiny imp inside the camera paints the picture). We meet Rincewind, the inept wizard who is kicked out of the university for wizards and is tasked by the Patrician to accompany the Disc's first tourist, Twoflower. It's unfortunate that Rincewind can't do magic ever since he looked at an ancient tome of spells on a dare and one of the 8 Great Spells lodged itself inside his head.

I think it's because in order to properly play a Pratchett character, you have to be a character actor. Sean Astin, a great talent, is great for playing realistic characters. His Twoflower is dreadful. The stilted I'm-reading-lines delivery is like summerstock quality acting. From Astin, this was both a shock and a real disappointment. I didn't even care that he's not Asian like Twoflower is supposed to be: he just isn't good. Most of the cast are like this. Tim Curry plays Tim Curry, as always, so it didn't feel at all like Pratchett. Just felt like Tim Curry. A few of the side characters do very well but the material is not well-scripted. Somehow the translation got from page to script without any of the timing that makes the humor work. Lines are slowly said, huge pauses grow between the question and response...the editing and timing just sucked the film dry. Visually they did very well on a TV budget but certain elements jar: elaborate velvet robes on the wizards work but putting Rincewind in a button-down oxford shirt under it made it seem again like amateur theater. It takes you completely out of the moment.  another example is a huge overuse of one 20' wall set of the Unseen University: you see it so much, you realize they built just this tiny peice and it again takes you out of the moment. Also it's boring. Likewise a lot of fans must have been used for crowd scenes: it shows obviously.
Because it's made for TV, the FX are sort of mediocre. The dragon fight hanging upside down apparently was terribly hard to film and that's too bad: it's cropped so close and cut up so much it's impossible to follow what's supposed to be happening. The action sequences are so clunky and slow that I suspect the director is at fault for much of this; there's just zero tension. Any movie involving Rincewind is mostly action as he spends his life running. Somehow, there's no speed to any of this production. It's just slow, choppy, akward.
And like Hogfather, if you aren't already aware of Discworld, nothing is explained to you, which leaves half the elements feeling like in-jokes. Why did Vetinari have to have his little dog? Anyone not a fan wouldn't know the difference and any fan would know we've never seen him with the dog. It's a good example of a detail included for the fan-base that is superflous and inaccurate. It's almost insulting--if you don't know about it, you don't need it and if you do, it's wrong. Jeremy Irons' Vetinari is actually pretty good though the lisp was annoying but again, script pacing and timing of pretty much everything needed to be rethought and re-edited. It would've been 40 minutes shorter but maybe it would've been good.

Fortunately for me, I was new to the Terry Pratchett universe and didn't have any expectations for this made-for-TV film. I was aware of some of the radical changes the producers made, but overall, I had a great time watching the Color of Magic and laughed out loud quite frequently. It is a hilarious sendup of everything we think of when we think about the fantasy genre, wizardry, and magic. After watching this, I became very interested in Pratchett's work and read up on Discworld mythology, so I disagree with the reviewers that this film is only interesting to existing Pratchett fans.

For the uninitiated, Discworld is a flat disc-shaped world held up on the backs of four elephants, who in turn are standing on a giant turtle traveling through space, a parody of ancient world creation myths, medieval astronomy, and cosmology. The story starts in Ankh-Morpork, a fictional city that looks like a dirty, crowded, industrial-age/Victorian English port, with a bungling and overly ""mature"" wizard named Rincewind (David Jason) being kicked out of the Unseen University after 40 years of ineptitude at learning even the most basic of spells. Soon Discworld's first ever tourist, Twoflower, arrives in town and after a series of comical mishaps, Rincewind is tasked, on pains of death, with keeping the naive (and wealthy) traveler safe. For die-hard Pratchett fans, they'll hate Sean Astin (of Sam Gamgee fame from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>) who is a white American being cast in the role of Twoflower, who is supposed to be Chinese and from the exotic ""Counterweight Continent"", home of a powerful and rich empire where the land is made of gold. His casting choice was supposedly due to a decision to bolster the film's international appeal, and I found him to be terribly miscast, never being able to shake from my mind his doofy look, naive simplicity, and demeanor from his LOTR character.

For a made-for-TV movie, this film certainly feels like a much bigger budget film. The cast is filled with stars, though some only make minor appearances (like Jeremy Irons, who plays a lisp-afflicted Patrician). Tim Curry is particularly fun to watch as the hilariously evil and devious Trymon. Brian Cox is equally outstanding as the narrator, and Christopher Lee as the voice of Death. The CG is fantastic and rivals any Hollywood production, with some very lavishly detailed. The costumes and set designs are also very well done and believable.

A highly entertaining and imaginative parody of the world and storytelling, I cannot recommend The Color of Magic strongly enough. For fans, it may be different from the book, but certain changes are required when translating to live action. Pratchett has found a new fan in me.",1258761600,,3168,5.232283464566929

It has the same wonderful magical feel that Hogfather did, and the same splendid attention to detail, for which my appreciation knows no bounds. It is really a treat to see this world come to life, and to know that it is in the hands of someone who not only loves and cares about the books and characters, but who gets the author involved as well.

I was very happy to see Terry Pratchett and Nigel Planer (who voiced a great number of Discworld audiobooks) in small roles in both this and Hogfather. Sean Astin was cute and innocent as Twoflower, David Jason great as Rincewind (though a tad older than I'd always imagined Rincewind being), not to mention superb performances by Tim Curry as power-hungry wizard Trymon and Jeremy Irons as cool-as-a-cucumber Vetinari (ooh, that Vetinari..)

We also get to see the Luggage come to life as never before, and I feel they got its homicidal nature spot on!

The books are complex, witty, clever and satirical, which is a huge challenge for cinema.  The omissions in this movie version are minimal with regard to the plot.  The casting, special effects, scene construction as well as musical scoring more than make up for some simplification.  Surely there will be more Pratchett movies done in similar fashion.

Sean Astin pretty much ruined this all on his own; there wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't leave me cringing. Worse, Jeremy Irons butchtered the clever and icy Patrician, giving him a lisp, of all things. I was embarrassed just watching this. Some of the storytelling was cute, but you'd be better off with the actual books. Hogfather was a thousand times better, and I didn't even like the original book all that much. Really, if you much be introduced to Pratchett through television, go with Hogfather, which was much truer to the book and to Terry's intelligent style.",1256428800,11,782,4.843283582089552

3556264,4,B001EM1E94,"Actually, considering it was made for TV, this adaptation is very well done.  I'm a long-time Terry Pratchett fan, but I think this movie (well, pair of movies) should also be quite accessible to people who have never read Pratchett's work.

The only trouble is that there is a LOT of material to cover (Pratchett novels are never thin!) So, to the eye that is not familiar with Discworld, I fear that these adaptations may seem to ramble a bit.  But, in any case, the rambling is always fun.  The apparent rambling is due to the fact that the storyline sticks very closely to the books, something I appreciate as a fan, and only hope that newcomers to Discworld don't feel lost or overwhelmed by the enormous scope that has been crammed into a short, movie-length time span.

Speaking of newcomers, I was delighted by Astin's portrayal of Twoflower, even though I had actually pictured Twoflower as more of a skinny, geeky type when I read the books.  Astin really carried off the sense of innocent wonder and plain fool's luck that kept Twoflower alive throughout all his adventures, and everything he did, even the simplest little line or gesture, just made me smile.

Rincewind was also very convincing, and Cohen the Barbarian was completely delightful.  I can't look at shoop the same way anymore!

I wasn't too keen on the way the Luggage was rendered, though.  I think its legs really should have looked more like those of a millipede.  The humanesque legs were distracting and unbelievable.  I guess I had pictured the legs as being more like those of a millipede.  Your mileage may vary!

Altogether a fun romp with a generous handful of thought-provoking zingers thrown in; almost as good as a Terry Pratchett novel, and that's saying a lot.",1255564800,,1752,4.739273927392739

3556268,5,B001EM1E94,"I'm just sitting here, hyperventilating after a couple of hours of Color of Magic.  What a RUSH!

I'm not saying it's perfect (5 stars not withstanding); the editing somehow gives the impression that matters are dragging along at a leisurely pace, whereas, of course, all hell is breaking loose in about 50 different ways.

The shifty-eyed Rincewind is set (by the Patrician) to be nursemaid to the colorful Two Flower, who has just invented the genre of The Tourist on Discworld (the fantastic world invented by Terry Pratchett, which is shaped more or less like a rotating LP, with the water forever falling off the edge).  Meanwhile, a dastardly wizard is bent on rising to the top of the Unseen University (of Wizardry) by assassinating every wizard ahead of him. A mystery of cosmic proportions presents itself: why is the Giant Atuin, the enormous Turtle on whose back Discworld is supported, headed on a collision course with an enormous new star?

Veteran Discworld afficionados will know that summarizing a Pratchett Plot is an exercise in futility.  Suffice it to note that all sorts of regulars are delightfully introduced, from the Patrician (Jeremy Irons, beatiful!) Cohen the Barbarian (Awesome!) The Luggage (Stupendous!!!) the Head Librarian (Er.  Ook?) and The Broken Drum.  There are transparent dragons, female heroes, and even an enormous Troll, and a floating mountain.  Sean Astin plays the accidental tourist, and does a beautiful job.

I think the movie has been brilliantly designed and executed, even if Rincewind is occasionally mildly disconcerting, as though he isn't just an inept wizard, but actually teaches inept wizarding at an acting school.  Still, we must be grateful to David Jason (who portrays Rincewind) because he's one of the producers, and it really is a beautiful job at many levels.  The special effects are just beautifully effective.

Some of the peculiarities of the movie are inherited from the book, I believe. The Color of Magic seems to have been the first of the Discworld books, and Discworld doesn't yet have the lived-in feel that the later books have. Where possible, the movie seems to improve on the book.  (Terry Pratchett himself appears as one of the wizards, in case you're interested. There is apparently an appearance by Granny Weatherwax, though I can't think where; possibly in the Rite of Spring).  The Inside Joke feeling some viewers might get is inevitable, since it's so difficult to present such a complex situation in each book, let alone a movie.  I wish they'd got a real Orang-utan, but that's probably asking too much.  (I thought I saw one in Hogfather, but maybe they just had a bigger primate budget.)  It's simple, mad entertainment, but it's probably best to watch it with someone familiar with Discworld, and a strong tranquilizer.

Insanely recommended.  Two bananas up!

One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, it brings back memories of old 80's movies about stupid stuff like swamp gators.  My wife and I sat through this very long movie last night, ...waiting the whole time for it to get started, with some sort of plot or theme, something!

The actors aren't bad, the filming isn't bad.  It's all the content, ...or lack of it, that's bad.  We left the movie asking ourselves ""now, what was that about? Huh?"".

The good points
- most special effects are well done, especially the turtle scenes. The exception was an old fashioned shot of Rincewind riding towards the camera on horseback with the background obviously added in later.
- The luggage was believable.
- The first archwizard gave the best performance of the cast. Cohen was OK.

The weak points
- I'm very disappointed in Sean Astin's performance. Was he acting at all or just saying the lines? He gave real depth to Sam the Hobbit but Twoflower was just flat
- Rincewind. Better but still not much character there.
- The evil wizard. Also felt strained. Trying too hard to be evil?
- Death - hated the echo effect. (Not the actor's fault) What was he saying? I wish the subtitles worked for the DVD.
- Much of the original humor was removed. Even with 3 hours of film things had to be cut but I really liked the book scenes with the trees talking to Rincewind and he refused to listen. Or the rocks talking to him. Or death & the four horseman playing bridge. Or sunlight slowed by magic.

The only quibble I have is that I'm not sure that I would have cast Sean Astin as Twoflower.

3556280,3,B001EM1E94,"I never really liked The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic much.  IMHO they are the weakest of all the Discworld books, and that's certainly understandable since they were the first two published.  So when I saw the well-produced Hogfather movie and liked it, then learned The Color of Magic was made into a movie also, I decided to take a chance.  I expected the weak Color of Magic story and the Hogfather-level production values and acting quality.

Well, as to production values this is not too bad.  We certainly see a lot of Rincewind closeups for long periods, sometimes to the detriment of other characters or situations that could use a little exploring (Cohen, Twoflower, the dragon home, etc.).  I feel that David Jason was much too old to play the Rincewind of this era, who is supposed to be about 30; Jason looks his age (68) in this.  If they can make a 54-year-old Alan Rickman look like a 30-year-old Snape, they could make Jason look younger too.  The sets are good, but the overall pacing feels too slow.  Note that this is a 2-parter, each part being 90 minutes.  I feel the whole thing could have been done more successfully as a one-part 2-hour movie, if they had only picked up the pace (not cutting anything out).

Now as to the acting:  At first glance it seems Jason is overdoing it, but Rincewind is an over-the-top character, so that's OK.  Where I had problems was with Sean Astin, who seemed to be trying to out-American himself and put all memories of the word ""Hobbit"" firmly out of everyone's minds, and Tim Curry, who plowed through this woodenly, his so-called ""evil grin"" more a rictus of discomfort.  It seemed as though he were gritting his teeth in frustration the whole time.  It is perhaps due to the fact that there were a lot of camera shots zoomed in on characters' faces (including Cohen and Bethany) where the camera seemed to be held too long.  It makes them appear as though they're just looking woodenly (I hate to repeat myself) off into space.

So, there are some pieces of this whole that didn't quite fit, and for that reason I give it only 3 stars.  But I also consider the material flawed.

3556283,3,B001EM1E94,"Ever since Carrot arrested him in Guards! Guards! I've been a fan of Lord Havelock Vetinari, the Patrician and thoughtful tyrant of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series.  That was the third Discworld novel I read and my first extended look at the Patrician and I immediately saw him in my mind's eye as looking and sounding exactly like Jeremy Irons.  Since then I've been convinced that Irons would be the perfect choice to play Vetinari in a movie or TV adaptation.  So I was happy when I read that he had been cast in the TV miniseries, The Color of Magic.

One of the disappointing things about the show, though, is that while I see Jeremy Irons as the perfect Patrician, Jeremy Irons apparently doesn't see Jeremy Irons as the perfect Patrician.

Irons sees the Patrician as someone slightly more foppish and fussy than himself, as somebody's strict piano teacher or a museum curator who's favorite expression is ""Don't touch"" given unlimited power to punish their pet peeves.  His Patrician doesn't sound like Jeremy Irons either.  He speaks with a lisp and replaces his R's at the beginnings of words with W's, which makes me wonder if we've been wrong about the name of his beloved dog all along and the mangy mutt's name is actually Ruffles.

Come to think of it, that might have been Irons' inspiration for the lisp.

At any rate, in the Color of Magic Irons plays Vetinari as a Jeremy Irons character instead of as Jeremy Irons and I think this costs the character a lot of its humor, which is based on the many ways the Patrician finds to express his menace in a calm and almost friendly manner.  It's difficult to imagine this more cartoonish Patrician having mimes chained up upside down in dungeons.

But Irons' choice on how to play his part isn't anywhere near as disappointing, or disconcerting, as the casting of David Jason as the inept and cowardly wizard Rincewind...

It wasn't until the fourth and fifth entries (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mort/dp/0061020680/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mort</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sourcery/dp/0061020672/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sourcery</a>) that I really started getting into the series. Maybe it's because I never was too fond of Twoflower, whose obliviousness was so pronounced that as a main character he simply lacked depth and believability; and this then made me not invest so much into the story. In later books, Pratchett would continue to hone his satirical thrusts, but he would also make you deeply care about the characters. So, no, Twoflower didn't do much for me. On the other hand, his murderous multi-legged Luggage became instantly all sorts of awesome. Carved out of rare sapient pearwood, the Luggage exuded chunks of personality, never mind that its preferred expression is... wooden.

This two-part tele-film adaptation actually combines the novels THE COLOUR OF MAGIC and its direct sequel THE LIGHT FANTASTIC. I'm trying strenuously to be objective in rating this movie, but it's hard going. Terry Pratchett ranks as one of my all-time favorite writers, and, as a serious fan of Discworld, a live action adaptation still counts as monumental news to me. THE COLOR OF MAGIC is more accessible than (if not as good as)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogfather/dp/B0010X741Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogfather</a>. With THE COLOR OF MAGIC you don't have to be as in the know and the spoofing is more obvious. It's a must-see for Discworld addicts, especially since these adapted two novels form the launching points of the series. But will the rest of the viewing audience like it? Probably. Hopefully. Or it could be my Discworld myopia talking.

On the shell of the enigmatic world turtle Great A'Tuin stand four colossal elephants, and on their backs lies the Discworld, an improbable place where ""hubwards"" and ""rimwards"" happen to be legitimate navigational directions. Focus in on the bustling city of Ankh-Morpork and narrow your gaze at the magical Unseen University, home of mighty wizards and Rincewind.

There are eight levels of Wizardry. In his forty years spent in the Unseen University, Rincewind - Discworld's most hapless and cowardly wizard (but he spells it ""wizzard"") - has yet to achieve even one level. At last Rincewind finds himself expelled for sheer incompetence, and off he goes. He promptly lands a gig as guide to the amiable Twoflower, Discworld's very first tourist.

Back in the Unseen University, skullduggery. It seems the speediest way to advance in the wizardly profession is thru assassination of one's immediate superior and the assumption of certain articles of his wardrobe. Thus, sporting new pointy shoes and hat signals sudden career upward mobility. One of the wizards, Trymon, is played to wicked smarmy perfection by Tim Curry and, glimpsing him, it quickly dawns on the viewer that someone or possibly several someones simply won't make it thru the film breathing. Even more dire, the Octavo - the greatest spellbook of all - is getting antsy and rattling its chains (yes, it's chained up!). One of its Eight Great Spells has gone missing and the absence is causing great turmoil at the University. Trymon, though, sees it as an opportunity.

But, mostly, the film chronicles the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower. Twoflower insists on seeing all the sights, which causes no end of concern for Rincewind who, as mentioned, is a champion coward. If there were a course for Running Away... well, there isn't, but he would've done really well in class. There's a rambling feel, an episodic sense, to the first part of the film as Rincewind and Twoflower just seem to trudge along, one crazy predicament after another. That they keep on surviving is due some to fortunate bumbling and also to that one spell skulking in Rincewind's memory. Yes, Rincewind possesses one spell. But he doesn't really know what it does.

There's also a subplot involving a scientific expedition which sets out to learn the Great A'Tuin's gender, the knowing of which is vital for some unexpressed but probably very important reason. As one astrozoologist asks: ""So we're gonna look at the turtle's bottom?""

And is that the Great A'Tuin inscrutably wending its way closer and closer towards a fiery red star? The people start to panic, as the star looms larger and larger. The Discworld needs a hero. Rincewind would please like to run away and fetch one. The story tightens up in the second part of the film, as Rincewind and Twoflower get caught up in a world-saving quest. So it's probably for the best that they run into Discworld's greatest warrior Cohen the Barbarian. Cohen has been in the hero business for eight decades, so it shouldn't be a surprise that the gent is now a geriatric. But he's still savvy. But savvy and toothless.

THE COLOR OF MAGIC has its share of parodies, satiric barbs, and all-around silliness, and mostly they're not so subtle. There's an overenthusiastic enchanted sword which bullies Rincewind into heroic acts (this is NOT appreciated by Rincewind). There's some gouge-me-in-the-eye-it's-so-awful wordplay regarding insurance policies, and the silly difference between the circumference and the circumfence (they both run around the edges of Discworld).

No problems at all with the acting. I don't know David Jason from Jason David, but he's pretty decent as Rincewind, although my sense was that the Rincewind in the novels was more robust. Sean Astin plays Twoflower, and he does a small wonder by making me like Discworld's first ever tourist. Tim Curry smiles and scowls, and both expressions are oily and pregnant with stab-you-in-the-back innuendos. One of my favorite characters in the Discworld series is Death, and he drops in for several humorous visits, usually timed whenever Rincewind is in mortal peril. And it's sweeeet that Christopher Lee provides Death's sepulchral voice. The best cameo, though, falls to Jeremy Irons. He shows up for half a mo as Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. The austere and despotic (but in a good way) Patrician is another of my favorites, and Irons truly does him justice. Also, author Terry Pratchett briefly moonlights as an astrozoologist, and it's absolutely fitting that he gets in the last word. Oh, and Brian Cox is quite good as the film narrator.

THE COLOR OF MAGIC doesn't have the scope of a big budget production, and yet the special effects are quite forgiveable and very much on par with what I expect from tele-films. It helps that the tone of the film is so very much nudge in the ribs. THE COLOR OF MAGIC, originally broadcasted in the U.K. in 2008, is presented in widescreen format on DVD. It runs at 197 minutes, so pack a lunch. In the Absolutely-No-Bonus-Features Department, the DVD comes with absolutely no bonus features.

The movie stays fairly true to the source material, but there are key omissions. If you've recently read THE LIGHT FANTASTIC, it'll hit you that the creepy things from the Dungeon Dimensions which, in the book, managed to burst thru into Discworld's reality, well, they don't do that in the movie. They don't even show up. We also miss out on a cameo from Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter (and future mother of the fabulous Susan Sto Helit). But, at least, we're treated to the Librarian, in both his pre-simian and then simian forms.

I'm stoked that the next Discworld project is bringing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-Postal-Discworld/dp/0552154326/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going Postal (Discworld)</a>&nbsp;to the cinema, and I can't wait to see how con artist Moist von Lipwig is rendered onscreen. But I'm really waiting on Death (a.k.a. Bill Door) or Commander Vimes & the City Watch to be featured as the central characters in future flicks. Sweet Oogly Moogly, may it be so!

3556285,3,B001EM1E94,"Terry Pratchett is the king of satirical comedy and this movie is a faithful rendition of his first book. Casting was well-done and for those who are Discworld fans, this is a fairly accurate version (better than most 'based on a book' movies). However, Terry was still 'finding his feet' at this time, and both the book and the movie reflect that. If you haven't read Pratchett before, start with the books and then give the movie a try. Otherwise, you might find yourself lost in the twisting alleyways of the Shades.",1249689600,,519,4.6521739130434785
3556286,3,B001EM1E94,"The Colour of Magic is a good effort which will be enjoyed by Disworld fans more than normal people. I won't rehash the plot because other reviewers have already done so. Here is a list of what I found dissapointing about this film.:

1. I was disappointed that Two Flower was not Chinese. It's like being a fan of Charlie Chan books and then when they make the films they cast...er, never mind.

2. Death was superb in Hogfather. Here (Christopher Lee- the Wicker Man) was good, I suppose, but they made an echo of his voice and half played it back over everything he said, the result being you couldn't understand a single thing he said. Didn't anyone LISTEN to this thing before airing it? The same complaint could be made about when the Spell in Rincewind's mind spoke over his voice, also indecipherable. I fear we lost some great lines.

3. One of my favourite characters in the books is the Librarian who was the most disappointing aspect of the film. They turned him into a joke. It was pathetic, really. They put a monkey mask on an actor, a small actor. Hardly comes across as an 800 orangatan. Didn't even ""ook"" properly.

Here's what I found excellent about this film:

1. The Patrician played by Jeremy Irons. He was brilliant. His ""Do not let me detain you"" was perfection. No one else should ever be allowed to play that role. The pity was he was only in two scenes. Made me long to see one of the more Patrician-rich books.

2. Rincewind (David Jason) was perfect. I didn't care for Rincewind in the books, he just wasn't one of my favourite characters, but after seeing the movie, I have a much greater appreciation for him. Jason did an excellent job pinning down the character.

3. Jean Astin (The Lord of the Rings) did a good job as the optimistic tourist Two Flower despite being a shade unbelievable at times. It's hard to maintain that kind of optimism without coming across all Nell Fenwick*. I suspect that the filmmakers felt that casting the role with a Chinese person who was a foolish tourist would incite too many complaints to the PC Obeisance Department and so cast the role with the only people we're allowed to make fun of anymore, young white men.

4. Cohen the Barbarian (David Bradley) was excellent and just how I pictured him.

5. The sets and costuming are excellent. You could practically smell Ankh-Morpork.

6. The Guilds of thieves, assassins, beggars etc who conspire to steal the luggage from Two Flower were wonderfully cast.

7. Finally, but hardly least, Dear Uncle Terry played a role himself. The author of all the discworld books, Terry Pratchett opened and closed the film. I'm happy to have him be part of his own film in a cameo. Like Alfred Hitchcock, only jollier.

So all in all, I offer 3 stars. If you're a discworld fan, you'll enjoy this. If you're not, why in the disc not?

* oh, and for those who can't figure out who Nell Fenwick is, shame on you, where is your cultural compass? From Dudley DoRight of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show, of course.",1249257600,20,3009,4.539741219963031
3556287,4,B001EM1E94,"i'm going to presume that you, like myself, are a long-time Discworld reader.  if you're not familiar with the plot of the first two books, or Terry Pratchett's writing, or the themes and characters of Discworld, you should skip this.  although the movie would be a good starting point for anyone unfamiliar with Discworld lore, this review is specifically for veterans of the books, if not the previous adaptations (Wyrd Sisters, Soul Music, Hogfather).

the plot(s) of The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic were carried over mostly intact.  some specific scenes or events are left out or glossed over, but i think it was an acceptable adaptation.

i have no problem with Twoflower being ""American.""  it works, it really does!  i don't remember it saying anywhere that Agateans *look* Asian.  but Twoflower's gormless optimism?  Sean Astin nails it!

i *do* have a problem with Rincewind.  for one, he seems too old; i know that's also a minor complaint, but he didn't look much younger than Cohen.  my bigger gripe is that Rincewind is supposed to be a runner (away), not a eye-roller.  less befuddled muttering, more screaming for help in 87 languages.  too much of his faux-exasperation falls flat

since i mentioned Cohen, i must say they did him justice.  mostly.  i mean, you can *clearly* see his teeth while he's complaining about not having teeth.  but his mannerisms and fight scenes are spot-on!

what else?  oh, the Librarian.  one of everyone's favorite characters, they must have gotten him perfect, right?  nope, it's an unconvincing guy in an ape suite.  i'm presuming they had reasons not to use a *real* orangutan, but the costume simply didn't work, in my eye.  put a man in an ape suit and it still moves like a man, not an ape.  it would have been less unreal (eg, more fantastic) to use a CG orang, or a Henson-esque puppet.

Death seemed better actuated (physically) than in Hogfather, but some of his lines sound more like Marvin from HHGTTG than Death.  for easy example: ""I WAS AT A PARTY, YOU KNOW"" sounded more like a complaint than a reproach.  still, ""I THINK I JUST HAD ANOTHER NEAR-RINCEWIND EXPERIENCE"" is worth the price of admission  =)

finally, the Luggage.  its movement was perfect!  it trundles around in a bouncy gait, often chasing people around in the background.  i wish its homicidal nature had been more on display, and they never did show its mouth (""lots of big square teeth, white as sycamore, and a pulsating tongue, red as mahogany"") but its ""expressions"" and reactions were subtle and brilliant.

all in all, i enjoyed The Colour of Magic more than Hogfather.  i also feel more comfortable recommending it to non-fans as there's less background to know and hidden context to be aware of.

i can't wait for Going Postal, the next adaptation.  oook!",1248739200,32,2806,4.794979079497908
3556288,5,B001EM1E94,"I know, I know... I shouldn't be such a fangirl when it comes to Pratchett, but I just can't help it! But then it's easy to gush when just about everything that's Discworld related has been either top notch or very, very close to it!

The movie spans the first two books of the Discworld series, Colour of Magic & The Light Fantastic. I'll admit that even though I did like the first two books, they did take a bit of getting used to the different writing style. They did change a few minor details as well as leave out one or two bits, but it doesn't diminish or take away from the overall storyline. I won't go into detail about the books due to the sheer detail and the fact that so many others have posted information about the books over the internet.

The movie brings back David Jason who had previously been seen as Death's assistant Alfred in Sky 1's previous adaptation of Hogfather. We also get such wonderful actors as Tim Curry & Sean Astin added into the mix. The quality honestly shows in the series & you can tell that the BBC tried their darndest to ensure that we got the best adaptation we can possibly get. That's not to say that this movie will appeal to everyone, though. If you didn't like Discworld to begin with, the odds are that many won't have their opinions changed... although I do predict that more than a few will become new fans.",1248566400,,1362,4.358267716535433
