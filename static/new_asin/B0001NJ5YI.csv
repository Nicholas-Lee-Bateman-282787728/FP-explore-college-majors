8015291,4,B0001NJ5YI,"This VHS tape from Moviecraft is very good.

This is a promotional film made by Westinghouse, so the majority of the footage is of their Pavillion at the Fair.

The color is a little faded but the transfer is generally very good.

Highly Recommended.",1188432000,,250,4.636363636363637
