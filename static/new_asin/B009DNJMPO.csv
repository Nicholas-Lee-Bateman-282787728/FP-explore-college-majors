8540388,5,B009DNJMPO,This has some very creative and specific yoga positions for tennis that help your balance and strength and flexibility.  Really helped me be able to bend my knees and get down to the ball and be able to reach more balls out wide.  Have been doing it once or twice a week and I can do it at the park while the kids are playing (by transferring to iPod Touch).,1348963200,,358,4.1
