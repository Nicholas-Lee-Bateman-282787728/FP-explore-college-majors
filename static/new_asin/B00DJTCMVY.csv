8593841,5,B00DJTCMVY,"A pilot crashes near Tammy and her Grandpas cabin in the swamp, and she nurses the bachelor back to health. When Grandpa goes to prison for bootlegging, Tammy moves in with a wealthy familythe bachelor, engaged to another, lives there. Of course, unschooled and naive Tammys in love with him. Think this movie is sappy and not worth watching? Give it a try. Debbie Reynolds is amazing, the acting is superb, wonderful color and cinematography, tender and emotional story. Theres an iconic film moment when Debbie Reynolds wistfully sings Tammy while sitting in her window seat. Wonderful movie experience. Must see viewing.",1483747200,,623,5.117647058823529
